Title: What Year-End CFO Moves Say About Finance Role’s Evolution

The year end is often a time for chief financial officer (CFO) appointments, resignations or transitions. And as the 2024 fiscal year draws to a close, a flurry of C-suite announcements from companies including Miracle-Gro, Humana, Chipotle, Dollar Tree and more reveal an intriguing narrative: the CFO role is undergoing a seismic shift and evolving beyond financial stewardship to encompass strategy, digital transformation and risk management at the highest levels. Chipotle CFO Jack Hartung, who has been at the company since 2002, was originally planning on retiring after nearly 25 years but decided to stay on “indefinitely” as president of strategy, finance and supply chain after the company switched CEOs. Healthcare company Humana announced Tuesday (Dec. 3) that it was bringing on as its new CFO the former finance chief of Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), an infrastructure fund manager recently acquired by BlackRock. Humana’s new CFO, Celeste Mellet, was formerly CFO, MD and EVP at investment banking advisory firm Evercore; CFO at Fannie Mae; and before that was global treasurer at Morgan Stanley. Both Dollar Tree and Miracle-Gro have announced CFO departures and started executive searches. In the meantime, Dollar Tree’s COO has taken on CFO responsibilities, while Miracle-Gro has elevated its current treasurer. The common thread linking the various executive announcements is their underlying message that the CFO role is no longer confined to the back office. It is a front-line position, driving strategy, innovation and resilience in an era of constant change. Read also: Why There Are No Sacred Cows for Today’s CFOs Historically, CFOs were perceived as gatekeepers of financial discipline, focused primarily on balance sheets, compliance and cost management. While that all remains true today, the CFO is increasingly seen as a strategic partner to the CEO, a change agent driving organizational growth. “Different industries have seen transition happen at different paces, but 20 years ago, the CFO was the senior accountant at the company … but now, the majority of companies need their CFO to be a strategic leader and trusted adviser, a crucial player in shaping the direction of the organization,” XiFin CFO Erik Sallee told PYMNTS in June for the series “A Day In The Life of a CFO.” One of the most significant drivers of this shift is digital transformation. With technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and real-time data analytics reshaping industries, CFOs are expected to spearhead initiatives that integrate these tools into financial operations. According to the PYMNTS Intelligence report “60 CFOs Can’t Be Wrong … AI Can Help Accounts Payable,” technology has reshaped CFOs’ responsibilities, necessitating a broader skill set and a more strategic approach to financial management. Creating data visualizations or reports is the most common use of generative AI, according to findings detailed in a separate PYMNTS Intelligence report, “Most CFOs See Limited ROI From GenAI, but Boost Its Investment.” “The finance department exists to fuel decision frameworks,” ABBYY CFO Brian Unruh told PYMNTS in June, noting that the “timely, accurate and multidimensional data” finance teams provide daily to the rest of the business is ultimately what helps define and accelerate internal growth drivers. Read more: How CFOs Are Managing the Year of Regulatory Anxiety Finance teams are continually tasked with navigating a complex and dynamic business environment. To remain competitive and drive growth in 2025, CFOs are focusing on several key areas, including cybersecurity, digital transformation, compliance and risk management, talent development and upskilling, real-time liquidity and working capital management, and cross-border expansion. As PYMNTS Intelligence found in the first two editions of “The 2024 Certainty Project” has found, the top four concerns of today’s middle-market financial leaders and their businesses include: Companies grappling with slowing growth, supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures are looking to CFOs to ensure financial stability while fostering innovation. As we enter 2025, the CFO role will likely continue to expand in scope and influence as corporate and enterprise operations demand dynamic and adaptable financial leadership. We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: From $94,870 to $103,679: Assessing the factors behind Bitcoin’s rally
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/from-94870-to-103679-assessing-the-factors-behind-bitcoins-rally/

Bitcoin’s $100K milestone seems to bedriven by institutional interest, crypto-friendly policies, and growing global support. Bitcoin [BTC] has crossed the $100,000 mark, achieving a major milestone for the crypto market. The price surge has drawn attention to factors such as institutional interest, regulatory developments, and global support for digital assets. Below, we explore the main reasons behind this rise. As of press time, Bitcoin was trading at $102,570 with a 24-hour trading volume of $141.34 billion. Over the last 24 hours, its price has risen by 6.19%, while a 6.78% gain has been recorded over the past week. Bitcoin’s market capitalization now stands at $2.01 trillion, based on a circulating supply of 20 million BTC. Bitcoin’s trading range over the last day spanned between $94,870 and $103,679, marking a new all-time high of $103,679. BTC exchange reserves have also been falling, indicating reduced selling activity. This suggests that investors are choosing to hold their assets. Source: CryptoQuant Institutional interest has played a significant role in Bitcoin’s rise past $100,000. A major contributor has been BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), which recently crossed $50 billion in assets under management. Notably, IBIT achieved this milestone within just 228 days, far faster than traditional ETFs, some of which have taken years to reach similar levels. The rapid growth of IBIT illustrates the increasing demand for Bitcoin among institutional investors. BlackRock has also integrated Bitcoin exposure into its traditional funds, further demonstrating its faith in the cryptocurrency’s potential. As more institutions adopt BTC as a key financial asset, the market continues to show strength. Regulatory changes have further fueled Bitcoin’s momentum. On 4th December, Donald Trump announced Paul Atkins, known for his crypto-friendly stance, as the new SEC chair, replacing Gary Gensler. This move has created optimism within the crypto industry, as it raises expectations for clearer and more supportive regulations in the U.S. Additionally, Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed strong support for BTC during the Russia Calling Investment Forum. Putin noted, “These tools will develop one way or another because everyone will strive to reduce costs and increase reliability.” His remarks highlight the global recognition of Bitcoin as a transformative financial technology, contributing to the ongoing rally. The derivatives market has also experienced significant growth alongside Bitcoin’s price surge. Open interest in Bitcoin futures has climbed to $64.70 billion, indicating heightened activity among both institutional and retail traders, according to an AMBCrypto report. The rise in open interest suggests continued confidence in BTC, even as profit-taking may occur in the short term. This uptick in futures trading activity reinforces BTC’s position as a sought-after asset in both spot and derivatives markets.

Title: Ethereum Breaks Barriers, Targets $6K Amid Record ETF, TVL Activity

The increasing prominence of Ethereum is once again in the spotlight, as recent data indicates a substantial inflow of funds into Ether-based ETFs. These products have experienced a remarkable $133 million in net inflows over the course of seven days, indicating a significant increase in institutional interest and investor confidence. Ethereum isn’t just optimistic about exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Analysts are making big price predictions for the cryptocurrency right now. This is because its network is being used more and more in decentralized finance (DeFi) and technical signs are showing that it will continue to rise. On December 3, the total net inflow of Ethereum spot ETFs was $133 million, and net inflows continued for 7 consecutive days. The net inflow of Fidelity ETF FETH was $73.7239 million, and the net inflow of BlackRock ETF ETHA was $65.2929 million. https://t.co/Tvs2oCSxTg pic.twitter.com/HOPyOqmXGU — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) December 4, 2024 A lot of people are interested in the Ethereum spot ETFs. Over $714 million has come into the top altcoin in the last week, showing that both institutional and individual buyers are becoming more interested in it. The ETHA ETF from BlackRock and the FETH ETF from Fidelity are leading the charge. Together, they have brought in about $140 million. The support of major financial institutions is boosting activity and demonstrating that Ethereum is becoming popular in the conventional finance sector. This flood of capital demonstrates how Ethereum may unite centralized and decentralized financial systems. According to market experts, the level of support for Ethereum stands at $3,300. This is a safe place for investors to start because it strikes a good balance between risk and return. Analysts propose a mid-term price target of $6,000 in case Ethereum continues its ascent. Some analysts even anticipate a long-term price of $10,000. If #Ethereum $ETH experiences a pullback, keep an eye on the $3,300 support level — a potential buying opportunity. Our mid-term target remains $6,000, with a long-term outlook of $10,000! https://t.co/mQQOjrKBFM pic.twitter.com/OEvDIV0ZpD — Ali (@ali_charts) December 4, 2024 Meanwhile, CoinCodex predicts that the price of Ethereum will have gone up by 6.17 percent to $4,052.34 by January 4, 2025. With an Extreme Greed number of 78 on the Fear & Greed Index and other technical indicators, it’s clear that people are planning to buy. Extreme confidence in the market suggests significant growth potential, but it is still important to take into account the inherent volatility of cryptocurrency investments. In the past 7 days, #Etherum‘s TVL increased by $4.81B, #Base‘s TVL increased by $302.02M, and #Hyperliquid‘s TVL increased by $290.21M. Funds have flowed into #Ethereum, #Base, and #Hyperliquid. pic.twitter.com/YDZOGU0Esc — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) December 2, 2024 The dominance of Ethereum in the DeFi market was cemented when its total value locked surged by $4.81 billion within a period of one week. However, while other networks, including Base and Hyperliquid, had their TVLs rise, Ethereum is still viewed as the leader. Ethereum’s trajectory appears optimistic due to its robust ETF inflows, bullish technical outlook, and increasing TVL. Although it may require some time to accumulate $6,000, the narrative is compelling due to institutional support and steady momentum. Ethereum remains a fundamental component of the cryptocurrency market, combining investor confidence with innovation.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: Waymo outsources fleet operations to African fintech Moove in Phoenix and Miami | TechCrunch

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Waymo is partnering with Moove, an African mobility fintech that offers vehicle financing to gig workers, to handle fleet management operations for its robotaxi service in Phoenix and, soon, Miami. The partnership marks several firsts. It will signal Waymo’s entry into Miami. And it’s also the first time Moove will enter the U.S. market and work with autonomous vehicles. Today, Moove operates in various cities across Africa, the Middle East, India, and the U.K., and it has raised over $400 million from backers like Mubadala Investment Company and BlackRock. Earlier this year, Moove scored $100 million in a round led by Uber. The partnership with Moove signals that Waymo is keen to outsource more of the commercial side of the business and focus on developing the self-driving technology as a driver-as-a-service model. Waymo has been offering a commercial ride-hail service in Phoenix for years, and began offering its robotaxis on the Uber app there alongside Waymo’s native app, Waymo One, in October 2023. In early 2025, Waymo’s robotaxis will be exclusively available on the Uber app in Austin and Atlanta. Waymo co-CEO Tekendra Mawakana wrote in a recent LinkedIn post that as the company scales autonomous vehicle operations, it intends to create an ecosystem of industry partners, including “charging infrastructure partners; fleet maintenance partners; full-electric automotive partners like Jaguar Land Rover…” Moove falls under the fleet maintenance partner umbrella. Waymo will still operate Waymo One in Phoenix and Miami, but Moove will take over fleet operations in Phoenix and help the company build out the necessary charging infrastructure and depots for its fleet of Jaguar I-Paces in Miami. Waymo intends to transition operations to Moove in Phoenix early next year. In Miami, Waymo will start small-scale testing in early 2025, with a goal to launch a fully driverless commercial ride-hail service in the city in 2026. As the company tests, Moove will build out the infrastructure Waymo needs to deploy in Miami, per a Waymo spokesperson. Waymo’s playbook for expanding into a new city usually begins by manually testing a small fleet, mainly for mapping purposes, before testing autonomously with a safety operator behind the wheel. Then Waymo pulls the driver out and invites employees to ride before launching commercially. Waymo would not share which neighborhoods the company is targeting in Miami, nor what the financial arrangement with Moove would be. A spokesperson for Waymo told TechCrunch that Moove’s global fleet management experience made the startup an attractive partner for handling robotaxi fleet operations. As established, the partnership marks a significant milestone for Moove: expanding its services to include autonomous vehicles and establishing its presence in the U.S., a process the startup began nearly four months ago, per job listings on LinkedIn. Since its launch, Moove has been an exclusive fleet partner for Uber, purchasing vehicles and leasing them to drivers who pay weekly until they own the cars. In 2022, Moove, talking up plans to become the largest EV partner on Uber’s platform in London, said it’ll deploy up to 10,000 EVs and over 6,000 charging points by the end of 2025, aligning with Uber’s goal of becoming an all-electric platform in the U.K. capital next year. While Moove may be looking to secure new partnerships (such as this one with Waymo) globally to diversify from Uber, its experience working with the mobility giant this long will prove helpful. It certainly helped secure Waymo as a customer. That said, for Moove, managing operations for Waymo’s autonomous fleets in two major U.S. cities is a big step. It expands the company’s global reach into the biggest leagues – as it diversifies its offerings beyond Africa and emerging markets – and showcases its ability to handle complex fleet operations in various markets. Moove has other plans in the U.S., based on job listings on the company’s website. There are several listings for a potential service in Los Angeles, although the nature of that is unclear. A Waymo spokesperson said the two don’t have plans to launch together in LA, where Waymo currently runs a commercial service. When asked, a Moove spokesperson confirmed that the company is recruiting for its burgeoning U.S. team, but declined to provide specifics.

Title: Stock market today: Indexes trade mixed after hitting records as traders eye upcoming jobs report

Indexes traded mixed on Thursday after hitting record highs on Wednesday as traders turned their focus to the upcoming November jobs report. The data, due from the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday morning, is expected to show the US economy added 215,000 new hires, according to data from FactSet. That's a sharp uptick from October's reading of just 12,000 new hires, with the stark downtick resulting from the month's hurricanes and labor strikes. "We recommend market participants tread carefully," Bank of America analysts said in a note earlier this week. "We suggest taking the first print with a pinch of salt and putting more faith in the first and second revision when more data has been collected." Here's where US indexes stood shortly after the 9:30 a.m. opening bell on Wednesday: Bitcoin hit an important milestone on Wednesday night, crossing the key $100,000 threshold for the first time. The latest uptick came after President-elect Donald Trump appointed crypto advocate Paul Atkins to replace Gary Gensler to run the Securities and Exchange Commission. The coin is now trading at $102,350.90 as of Thursday morning, while crypto-linked stocks like MicroStrategy and Coinbase have also benefited from the latest move higher. The currency has skyrocketed in recent weeks amid expectations that Trump will loosen regulations and pursue policies to boost the market, such as establishing a national bitcoin reserve. Traders also continue to digest comments from members of the Federal Reserve, including Chair Jerome Powell, who spoke at The New York Times' DealBook Summit on Wednesday. Relevant to bitcoin, the Fed chief said that while the token isn't a competitor to the dollar, it's a digital version of gold. Powell also appeared optimistic about the strength of the US economy, pointing to healthy growth but increased caution when it comes to cutting interest rates. "Growth is definitely stronger than we thought, and inflation is coming a little higher," Powell said, adding, "The good news is that we can afford to be a little more cautious as we try to find neutral."

Your favorite social media marketing event is headed to NYC this May 12–14! Register for Social Media Week before December 16 to lock in early-bird rates and save 50% on your pass. Citibank’s chief marketing and content officer Alex Craddock believes that despite the power of AI, the magic of great creative still comes from humans. Craddock joined Citi in May from BlackRock after a restructure to oversee its marketing department and set a new strategy for original content and thought leadership, ADWEEK reported at the time. He said that Citi is in the early stages of using AI and is focused on three things: content creation, personalization, and intelligence. Speaking at the AI Trailblazers Growth Summit alongside former LendingTree chief marketing officer Shiv Singh, Craddock shared how AI is reshaping marketing and content strategies at Citi. Craddock believes that the biggest benefits of generative AI specifically are the impact, and therefore revenue, it can drive. Because the financial industry is highly regulated, Craddock said that AI has helped Citi ensure it has the right disclosures on AI-generated content. It also uses data from its apps to personalize messaging based on user activity and banking information at scale. Craddock said Citi still has a long way to go to incorporate AI into its workflows in a way that is affordable and legally adherent. However, his goal is to continue using the tech to create more effective marketing and anticipate the needs of Citi’s customers in real time. “Yes, you’ve got regulations, rules, and guidelines that you have to work with, [but] they shouldn’t stop you [from] thinking with a vision,” he said. When it comes to concerns about AI’s threat to jobs, Craddock said people should think of it as an “enabler” and consider how it can be used to assist with mundane tasks, like writing emails. “It should not replace the human touch,” he said. “The magic is in humans, and I think if we forget that, we will end up in a dreadful world where bots are speaking to us all the time.” In early October, Citi shared its gen AI strategy, including how it is training its workforce to use the technology and how it is using it to provide better experiences for its clients.

Prior to joining in Aug. 2024, she was editorial assistant at Billboard. Her work has also appeared in W Magazine, GRAMMY.com, Pigeons & Planes, Vulture and more.

Title: What next for Bitcoin after bursting $100k barrier?
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqjz04lv5q9o?xtor=AL-72-%5Bpartner%5D-%5Byahoo.north.america%5D-%5Bheadline%5D-%5Bnews%5D-%5Bbizdev%5D-%5Bisapi%5D
Time Published: 2024-12-05T13:15:13Z
Full Content:
Bitcoin's price has blasted through the much-anticipated threshold of $100,000, raising questions about how much higher it could go - and whether it can shake off its notorious volatility. The world's largest cryptocurrency rose to around $103,400 shortly after 04:00 GMT on Thursday, before falling slightly. Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, described it as a "magic moment" for the cryptocurrency and said it had a "clear link" to Donald Trump's election victory. Trump took to social media to celebrate the milestone, posting "congratulations Bitcoiners" and "you're welcome!" The president-elect had previously pledged to make the US the "crypto capital" and "Bitcoin superpower" of the world, helping to push Bitcoin's price higher once he was elected president. It broke through the $100k barrier after Trump said he would nominate former Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) commissioner Paul Atkins to run the Wall Street regulator. Mr Atkins is seen as being far more pro-cryptocurrency than the current head, Gary Gensler. "Clearly there is anticipation that the new administration is going to be somewhat more favourable to crypto than the old administration was," said Andrew O'Neill, digital assets expert at S&P Global. "So for the price of Bitcoin, I think that that's what's driven the trend so far [and it will] likely continue into the new year," he added. However, Bitcoin has a history of sharp falls as well as rapid rises - and some analysts have cautioned that is unlikely to change. “A lot of people have got rich from the cryptocurrency soaring in value this year, but this high-risk asset isn’t suitable for everyone," said Mr Coatsworth. "It’s volatile, unpredictable and is driven by speculation, none of which makes for a sleep-at-night investment." During the US presidential election campaign, Trump sought to appeal to cryptocurrency investors with a promise to sack Gary Gensler - chair of the US financial regulator the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) - on "day one" of his presidency. Mr Gensler's approach to the cryptocurrency sector has been decidedly less friendly than Trump's. He told the BBC in September it was an industry “rife with fraud and hucksters and grifters”. Under his leadership, the SEC brought a record 46 crypto-related enforcement actions against firms in 2023. Mr Gensler said in November he would step down on 20 January - the day of Trump's inauguration. The choice of Paul Atkins to replace him at the helm of the SEC has been welcomed by crypto advocates. Mike Novogratz, founder and chief executive of US crypto firm Galaxy Digital said he hoped the "clearer regulatory path" would now accelerate the digital currency ecosystem's entry into "the financial mainstream." Bitcoin has seen fewer drastic falls in value during 2024 than in previous years. In 2022 its price fell sharply below $16,000 after crypto exchange FTX collapsed into bankruptcy. A number of key events besides Trump's victory in the election have helped boost investor confidence that its value will keep going up. The SEC approved several spot Bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETFs) allowing giant investment firms like Blackrock, Fidelity and Grayscale to sell products based on the price of Bitcoin. Some of these products have seen billions of dollars in cash inflows. But its potential to suddenly plummet in value serves as a reminder that it is not like orthodox currencies - and investors have no protection or recourse if they lose money on Bitcoin investments. Carol Alexander, professor of finance at Sussex University, told BBC News that fear of missing out (FOMO) among younger people will see Bitcoin's price continue to rise. But she added that while this could spark a rise in other cryptocurrencies, many of the younger investors investing in meme coins are losing money. Kathleen Breitman, co-founder of another cryptocurrency - Tezos - also had a word of caution for those tempted to invest in Bitcoin. "These are markets that tend to move on momentum so you need to be extraordinarily cautious with it," she told the BBC. Haliey Welch's "Hawk" digital coin shot up in price then lost 95% of its value just hours after it launched.

Title: Bitcoin hits $100,000 as investors bet on Trump crypto rally
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqjz04lv5q9o
Time Published: 2024-12-05T12:23:35Z
Full Content:
Bitcoin's price has blasted through the much-anticipated threshold of $100,000, raising questions about how much higher it could go - and whether it can shake off its notorious volatility. The world's largest cryptocurrency rose to around $103,400 shortly after 04:00 GMT on Thursday, before falling slightly. Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, described it as a "magic moment" for the cryptocurrency and said it had a "clear link" to Donald Trump's election victory. Trump took to social media to celebrate the milestone, posting "congratulations Bitcoiners" and "you're welcome!" The president-elect had previously pledged to make the US the "crypto capital" and "Bitcoin superpower" of the world, helping to push Bitcoin's price higher once he was elected president. It broke through the $100k barrier after Trump said he would nominate former Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) commissioner Paul Atkins to run the Wall Street regulator. Mr Atkins is seen as being far more pro-cryptocurrency than the current head, Gary Gensler. "Clearly there is anticipation that the new administration is going to be somewhat more favourable to crypto than the old administration was," said Andrew O'Neill, digital assets expert at S&P Global. "So for the price of Bitcoin, I think that that's what's driven the trend so far [and it will] likely continue into the new year," he added. However, Bitcoin has a history of sharp falls as well as rapid rises - and some analysts have cautioned that is unlikely to change. “A lot of people have got rich from the cryptocurrency soaring in value this year, but this high-risk asset isn’t suitable for everyone," said Mr Coatsworth. "It’s volatile, unpredictable and is driven by speculation, none of which makes for a sleep-at-night investment." During the US presidential election campaign, Trump sought to appeal to cryptocurrency investors with a promise to sack Gary Gensler - chair of the US financial regulator the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) - on "day one" of his presidency. Mr Gensler's approach to the cryptocurrency sector has been decidedly less friendly than Trump's. He told the BBC in September it was an industry “rife with fraud and hucksters and grifters”. Under his leadership, the SEC brought a record 46 crypto-related enforcement actions against firms in 2023. Mr Gensler said in November he would step down on 20 January - the day of Trump's inauguration. The choice of Paul Atkins to replace him at the helm of the SEC has been welcomed by crypto advocates. Mike Novogratz, founder and chief executive of US crypto firm Galaxy Digital said he hoped the "clearer regulatory path" would now accelerate the digital currency ecosystem's entry into "the financial mainstream." Bitcoin has seen fewer drastic falls in value during 2024 than in previous years. In 2022 its price fell sharply below $16,000 after crypto exchange FTX collapsed into bankruptcy. A number of key events besides Trump's victory in the election have helped boost investor confidence that its value will keep going up. The SEC approved several spot Bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETFs) allowing giant investment firms like Blackrock, Fidelity and Grayscale to sell products based on the price of Bitcoin. Some of these products have seen billions of dollars in cash inflows. But its potential to suddenly plummet in value serves as a reminder that it is not like orthodox currencies - and investors have no protection or recourse if they lose money on Bitcoin investments. Carol Alexander, professor of finance at Sussex University, told BBC News that fear of missing out (FOMO) among younger people will see Bitcoin's price continue to rise. But she added that while this could spark a rise in other cryptocurrencies, many of the younger investors investing in meme coins are losing money. Kathleen Breitman, co-founder of another cryptocurrency - Tezos - also had a word of caution for those tempted to invest in Bitcoin. "These are markets that tend to move on momentum so you need to be extraordinarily cautious with it," she told the BBC. Haliey Welch's "Hawk" digital coin shot up in price then lost 95% of its value just hours after it launched.

More Info Private equity firm EQT is creating a new energy transition fund, EQT Transition Infrastructure, which will look to invest in clean energy companies in Europe, North America, and the Asia Pacific. The first acquisition of the Sweden-headquartered private equity firm with $259 billion (246 billion euros) in total assets under management is Germany’s ju:niz Energy, a battery energy storage system developer and operator, EQT said on Thursday. The German company will be the EQT Transition Infrastructure strategy’s first highly thematic investment, which will be acquired with capital from EQT’s balance sheet, the firm said without disclosing the value of the deal. EQT Transition Infrastructure plans to provide capital, as well as industrial, technological, and sustainability expertise to scale businesses and support the transition to a decarbonized and climate-resilient future, the private equity firm said. The EQT Transition Infrastructure strategy will be led by Jan Vesely, Head of EQT Transition Infrastructure in New York, and Asis Echaniz, Head of EQT Transition Infrastructure Europe in Madrid. The strategy will be chaired by Francesco Starace, who joined EQT in 2023 from his position as CEO of Italian electric utility giant Enel. “EQT Transition Infrastructure will help emerging but proven solutions and businesses scale, to create the next generation of sustainable energy infrastructure,” said Jan Vesely, Partner and Head of EQT Transition Infrastructure. Earlier this week, the EQT Active Core Infrastructure fund and global investor GIC announced an agreement to buy a majority stake in Calisen Group, the UK’s leading independent smart metering company, from funds managed by Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), a part of BlackRock, the Infrastructure business of Goldman Sachs Alternatives and Mubadala Investment Company. “Long-term investment by EQT and GIC to support Calisen’s growth ambitions in the UK smart meter market and abroad, as well as expansion into adjacent sectors,” EQT said upon announcing the deal.

Title: BlackRock sees 'exceptionalism' powering US stocks higher in 2025

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks have led the equity market in recent years and strategists at BlackRock's Investment Institute don't see that narrative changing in 2025. "Currently, across all the scenarios in the outlook, the platform is gravitating towards the US corporate strength scenario, which is another way of calling for US exceptionalism," BlackRock Investment Institute chief investment strategist Wei Li said during a media roundtable on Wednesday. Li cited stronger earnings growth seen in the US this year and the expectation that earnings growth will continue to broaden outside of the "Magnificent Seven" names that have powered the stock market higher over the last two years. This view has been a common refrain from Wall Street firms offering bullish outlooks for 2025 over the last month. "Earnings is almost everything when it comes to longer-term equity returns," Li said, adding the strongest revisions for next year have come from the US and Japan, where BlackRock is also overweight equities. BlackRock's call for continued US exceptionalism has been echoed at other firms on Wall Street during 2025 outlook roundtables. On Monday, Bank of America senior US economist Aditya Bhave told Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal the US economy will likely outperform in 2025. In October, the team at JPMorgan Asset Management said it believes the US's role in the rise of artificial intelligence will help its economy outpace others around the world. The firm said this will result in US equities continuing to dominate globally over the next decade. "We expect extraordinary earnings growth will settle at still-elevated levels for mega-cap tech while reaccelerating in other areas of the market," JPMorgan Asset Management's chief global strategist David Kelly wrote in his team's 2025 outlook. "This broadening, coupled with resilient economic fundamentals, policy tailwinds, and secular trends, should support a more inclusive rally in the year ahead." On a sector level, BlackRock noted Wednesday that Utilities (XLU) should be set to benefit from the broadening of the AI trade due to the increased power demands to operate AI servers. All of this puts BlackRock further overweight US equities headed into 2025 and betting on a "pro-risk" environment in 2025. "In an environment where there's spirit animals that are poignant, it's not clear exactly who's going to take away the punch bowl in this environment," said Jean Boivin, the head of BlackRock's Investment Institute. "We're constructive, we're pro-risk ... But I think we need to be mindful of excessive risk-taking at some point as well down the road." And while BlackRock doesn't issue an S&P 500 target for the year ahead, its bullish stance on US stocks has been reflected across Wall Street's 2025 outlooks. Strategists tracked by Yahoo Finance have issued 2025 year-end S&P 500 targets as low as 6,400 and as high as 7,007. The index closed at 6,086 on Wednesday, meaning the low-end 6,400 target represents about a 5% upside in the benchmark index over the next year. Meanwhile, the high end of forecasts is calling for another 15% gain in the S&P 500 over the next 12 months. Strategists believe another strong year of growth in both the US economy and corporate earnings, combined with a pro-business administration in the White House and Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, will propel stocks higher. In a Tuesday research note detailing his Street-high 7,007 S&P 500 target, Wells Fargo equity strategist Christopher Harvey wrote the data "did not support" a weak or negative year for the S&P 500. "2025 is likely to be a solid-to-strong year," Harvey wrote. Josh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow him on X @_joshschafer.

Title: W.Va. Rep.-Elect Riley Moore: How GOP Can Deliver for Working-Class Families

Send an email to Bradley. President-elect Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 election marked the first time in 20 years that a Republican presidential candidate won the popular vote in addition to the electoral vote. The commanding fashion of Trump’s historic comeback was further proof that the political realignment Trump started nearly a decade ago—transforming the Republican Party into the party of the working class—is being further cemented. And it’s no surprise, then, that victors of down-ballot elections are increasingly representing the coalition that now makes up the Republican base. Rep.-elect Riley Moore, R-W.Va., is a perfect example, and he joined me on this week’s episode of “The Signal Sitdown.” Now that the GOP has rebranded itself as a multiracial, working-class party, our conversation particularly focuses on how Republican lawmakers in Washington, D.C., can deliver for their supporters. “People don’t want to monkey around,” Moore said of the incoming Congress. “They don’t want to horse around on any of this stuff. They just want to go. President Trump has got the mandate, and President Trump has got the vision, and that’s what we’re going to work on.” This vision is not only important to the president, but to the American people who, for the first time since President Grover Cleveland in the late 1800s, have sent a former president back to the White House. Though Moore will be a freshman member of Congress, he has experience delivering policy victories for a constituency made of working-class voters as the state treasurer of West Virginia. The Mountain State, which voted 70% for Trump in the 2024 election, is a good encapsulation of the ethos that propelled Trump to the forefront of American politics. His Make America Great Again movement has always felt more like West Virginia than Texas, and for good reason, as West Virginians have shouldered much of the burden for Washington’s globalist immigration, trade, and foreign policies. “We’re tired of being lied to, and we’re tired of being taken advantage of,” Moore said of West Virginians. “I mean, we mine the coal that forged the steel that built the buildings, that built the airplanes and the warships and the rails and everything else that built the United States.” “And what do we get?” Moore added. “An opioid crisis and destroying our coal industry.” For too long, Washington, D.C., has had a “total disregard for the feelings of the people of West Virginia,” Moore told me. “It dates back to [the North American Free Trade Agreement], particularly in my district—northern panhandle specifically would be a great example—where we do a lot of steel manufacturing,” Moore explained. “We had tens of thousands of people working in that industry, obviously. That’s not the case now due to globalization and offshoring and dumping of cheap steel, which, for some reason, people of this town have allowed to happen for successive decades. Letting China into the World Trade Organization, most favored nation status, and all these other things piled on top of it that has really crushed a state like West Virginia.” Fast-forward to President Barack Obama’s tenure, and the destruction accelerated. Due to what Moore calls “environmental extremism,” West Virginia “lost 30,000 coal mining jobs in just a few years due to the Obama administration.” The continued leftward lurch of economic policies from both public and private institutions has only compounded some of West Virginia’s woes. “We had coal operators coming to me saying, ‘I’m losing access to capital. We can’t finance our stuff. No one will bank with us. We’re getting debanked all over the place,’” said Moore, adding: “This [environmental, social, and governance] movement that was destroying West Virginia.” West Virginia responded by chasing out as many ESG-promoting financial institutions from the state as possible, particularly by divesting West Virginia taxpayer dollars from companies like BlackRock. “The working class in West Virginia was like, ‘Yes! Thank you for doing this: fighting for our jobs, fighting for our economy, fighting for our way of life,’” Moore said. Moore said he’s bringing the same mindset with him to Washington. “They did not elect me to get on television and tell them that they’re getting screwed. They already know that. They know that. They elected me to do something about it.” Trust in the legacy media is at an all-time low. That’s because they are out of touch, deliberately lie to the American public, and ignore conservative audiences.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 AI Stocks That Will Skyrocket. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Arm Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM) stands against other AI stocks that will skyrocket. Some investors are heavily scrutinizing Big Tech’s AI spending. Despite these hefty expenditures, Big Tech has been enjoying solid revenues and earnings growth. Yung-Yu Ma, CIO at BMO Wealth Management, recently joined Yahoo Finance to shed light on the overall AI sector outlook heading into 2024. Ma believes that companies are increasing their investments in AI in anticipation of higher returns. He said that it makes sense that the market is less likely to be enthusiastic about this situation. Ma argued that while spending on AI is likely to increase, there is a certainty that the results will soon show, maybe by the end of 2025. He added that the market will probably see healthy earnings growth in 2025. Spending is broadly going to drive these earnings, particularly AI and its different use cases such as data centers, electricity grids, and other infrastructure. He expects an overall growth in valuation and shared that Big Tech is extremely confident and committed to pouring investment into the sector. 2024 has been quite a year for artificial intelligence. Existing startups like Anthropic and Databricks have been performing exceptionally well and transforming the industry. Anthropic is an AI safety and research company behind the OpenAI rival, Claude. On November 24, Anthropic extended its partnership with AWS, involving another $4 billion investment, bringing the total to $8 billion. The partnership also positions AWS as Anthropic’s primary cloud and training partner. Keeping up with the partnership, on December 4, Anthropic began optimizing Claude models to be able to run on AWS Trainium 2. Databricks, the data and AI company, is another AI startup crucial to the AI revolution. Some of the products by Databricks include data management solutions, data warehousing, real-time analytics, data sharing, and data governance. The company is expanding to new heights. On November 6, the company partnered with KT Corporation to boost data and AI innovation in Korea. Following the trend, on November 20, Databricks announced it saw 70% annualized growth in its French business and has launched a new office in central Paris. To come up with AI stocks that will skyrocket, we consulted media reports to shortlist stocks that are expected to perform exceptionally well according to analysts and strategists. After consulting 10 similar rankings on the internet we examined the Street-High upside for each stock and picked the ones with the highest upside, as of December 3, 2024. Our list is in ascending order of the street high upside as of December 3, 2024. We have also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment for each stock. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Some of its leading partners in the AI industry include SoundHound AI, Weetaq, Embedl, ENERZAi, and Doulos, to name a few. Analysts are also favoring the stock and their high price target of 200 represents an upside of 42% from current levels. Overall, ARM ranks 6th on our list of AI stocks that will skyrocket. While we acknowledge the potential of ARM to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Beef, milk supply TAINTED with new BlackRock-backed animal drug called Bovaer that claims to stop animal farts
URL: https://www.naturalnews.com/2024-12-05-beef-milk-tainted-blackrock-bovaer-animal-farts.html
Time Published: 2024-12-05T06:00:00Z
Full Content:
Beef and dairy cattle are eating the drug, made by DSM-firmenich â BlackRock is a major shareholder in DSM-firmenich, by the way â as part of an effort by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations (UN) to decrease animal methane releases and thus cool planetary temperatures. The idea was hatched back in 2006. The FAO started fearmongering about cattle casting a "long shadow" with their flatulence, which comes out slightly warm and stinky much to the chagrin of the globalists who fear that the weather might get too hot if something is not done to cap those smelly fumes. A report issued at that time by the UN claimed that livestock is responsible for 18 percent of the world's greenhouse gases. It turns out this figure was pulled out of a bull's behind, so to speak. (Related: Did you hear that the FDA just approved a new drug called 3-NOP for dairy cattle that supposedly stops them from farting â but at what cost?) Animal farts are normal Dr. Frank Mitloehner, an air quality specialist in the Department of Animal Sciences at UC Davis, says the report and its claims are wildly flawed. And the FAO was later forced to admit that Mitloehner is right. "I must say honestly that he has a point," commented one of the study's authors about Mitloehner's discovery that the paper only looked at "the tailpipe emissions of cars" rather than conduct "a comprehensive life-cycle assessment." "We factored in everything for meat emissions, and we didn't do the same thing with transport â we just used the figure from the IPCC ..." The researchers now admit that while they did conduct a full life-cycle analysis on meat, taking into account both direct and indirect emissions, the only thing factored in as far as the transportation of meat is concerned was direct emissions, "leaving out activities like extracting fuel or the disposal of old cars." "While FAO researchers initially stuck with their 18 percent figure based on their confidence in what makes up total emissions worldwide, a subsequent FAO study calculated global livestock emissions slightly lower, at 14.5 percent." Mitloehner says that the way to create "less heat," if that is what the climate cultists are worried about, is to do "smarter animal farming, not less farming." "Producing less meat and milk will only mean more hunger in poor countries," he warns. It turns out that the original FAO report from 2006 that started all this does not even contain evidence to back the claim that the "livestock sector" is responsible for producing too many greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide. Much of the public confusion over the supposed role that meat and milk play in climate change is attributable to just two sentences in the report that are printed only in the executive summary and nowhere else in the body of the text: "The livestock sector is a major player, responsible for 18 percent of greenhouse gas emissions measured in CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalents). This is a higher share than transport." Both of these sentences are factually wrong, and yet these false claims serve as the foundation of a decades-long quest by climate lunatics to stamp out animal flatulence and other natural processes that they strangely fear are going to destroy the planet. "Methane emitted by livestock is part of the biogenic carbon cycle, a natural process," Mitloehner says.

The idea was hatched back in 2006. The FAO started fearmongering about cattle casting a "long shadow" with their flatulence, which comes out slightly warm and stinky much to the chagrin of the globalists who fear that the weather might get too hot if something is not done to cap those smelly fumes. A report issued at that time by the UN claimed that livestock is responsible for 18 percent of the world's greenhouse gases. It turns out this figure was pulled out of a bull's behind, so to speak.

Animal farts are normal Dr. Frank Mitloehner, an air quality specialist in the Department of Animal Sciences at UC Davis, says the report and its claims are wildly flawed. And the FAO was later forced to admit that Mitloehner is right. "I must say honestly that he has a point," commented one of the study's authors about Mitloehner's discovery that the paper only looked at "the tailpipe emissions of cars" rather than conduct "a comprehensive life-cycle assessment." "We factored in everything for meat emissions, and we didn't do the same thing with transport â we just used the figure from the IPCC ..." The researchers now admit that while they did conduct a full life-cycle analysis on meat, taking into account both direct and indirect emissions, the only thing factored in as far as the transportation of meat is concerned was direct emissions, "leaving out activities like extracting fuel or the disposal of old cars." "While FAO researchers initially stuck with their 18 percent figure based on their confidence in what makes up total emissions worldwide, a subsequent FAO study calculated global livestock emissions slightly lower, at 14.5 percent."

This is a higher share than transport." Both of these sentences are factually wrong, and yet these false claims serve as the foundation of a decades-long quest by climate lunatics to stamp out animal flatulence and other natural processes that they strangely fear are going to destroy the planet.

Title: The most expensive Irish homes sold in 2024: From a Cork estate to a mansion once owned by Jennifer Guinness

Full Content:
Against the backdrop of people raising concerns about high rents and a shortage of affordable housing to canvassing politicians in advance of last Friday’s general election, on the opposite end of the spectrum, Ireland’s super-prime residential market has been motoring on quietly and is showing no sign of slowing down. As the end of 2024 approaches, an examination of the Property Price Register (PPR) shows that approximately 1,235 sales have been completed nationally for sums of €1 million and above. The figure is roughly the same as that transacted until the end of November 2023 and over the same period in 2022. A further inspection of the register shows that approximately 202 sales with a value of €2 million and above were completed in Ireland in the 11-month period to the end of November, while 62 homes changed hands for at least €3 million, with the most valuable sale approaching €30 million. What follows are the top 10 residential sales by value this year. Where they appear on the register, the recorded figure reflects the amount paid for the principal residence and up to an acre of land. When a residential property sale includes more than an acre of land, the value of that extra land is not included on the register; we have marked the sale prices of these homes with an asterisk. A few miles upstream from Youghal in east Cork is Ballynatray House, a late Georgian estate set on 850 acres, located on a bend in the river Blackwater, which achieved €29.25 million, according to the PPR. It is understood to have been sold off-market last February, making it the most valuable transaction to have taken place in the Irish residential market so far this year. The PPR does not take into account the 850 acres of land included in the property, with some reports estimating the full sale price to be in the region of €32 million to €35 million. Situated where the river is at its most expansive, the 11-bay, two-storey-over-basement classical-style house is understood to have been bought by British vacuum-cleaner magnate, James Dyson. Ballynatray House was built between 1795 and 1797 on a symmetrical plan incorporating the fabric of an earlier house (built circa 1700), and includes ruins of an ancient abbey as well as estate houses. The property last came to market in March 2003, when it was purchased for over €11 million by property investor Henry Gwyn-Jones, along with 400 acres of land. Gwyn-Jones bought it from French aristocrats Serge and Henriette Boissevain, who had bought Ballynatray in 1995 when the then-1,000-acre estate sold for about £1.5 million. It is said the Boissevains entertained many of Europe’s best and brightest at the residence, including Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, known as Princess TNT, whom one local recalls being photographed on the lawns for a glossy fashion magazine. The grounds of Ballynatray House also featured in the 1975 Stanley Kubrick movie Barry Lyndon, which starred Ryan O’Neal. Censure House was launched to the market seeking €15 million in May, 2022. When it didn’t sell at that price, it is understood to have gone through a number of agents before being sold by Lisney for €10 million (17 per cent below its €12.5 million guide price) in March of this year, according to the PPR. It is a six-bedroom property extending to 1,365sq m (14,700sq ft), with a lift for simple transportation to all floors, and a self-contained one-bedroom apartment. The apartment was built on the site of an existing Regency villa, named Ceanchor House, which once belonged to the late socialite Jennifer Guinness. Nestled into the rock face, the property is sheltered from the elements by mature trees, while it maintains sea views to its south, east and west. It also abuts the cliff walk, so, despite the elevation, you can exit a gate and nip down the cliffs to take a dip in the sea at Jameson Beach, one of Howth’s few south-facing swimming spots, within a matter of minutes. Read our full review here A decade ago, when it last went on the market, Victoria House also made the list of the 10 most expensive house sales of the year. It was purchased for €4.41 million, according to the PPR, and has since been extensively remodelled and extended by its most recent owners. It was brought to market last April by Sherry FitzGerald, seeking €10 million – a sum which it achieved in September, according to the PPR. The vendors of the classic Victorian restored its coving, cornicing and ceiling roses and had engineers reinforce the feature staircase. They also engaged Bloom-gold-medal-winning landscape architect Jane McCorkell to reimagine the beautiful south-facing back garden. Set on the sunny side of this embassy belt road and extending to 550sq m (5,901sq ft), the six-bedroom residence backs on to the German ambassador’s residence, Danesfield, set on four acres. Read our full review here Melbeach was sold off-market deal by Inhous. Set over three floors, the six-bedroom house extends to about 743sq m (8,000 sq ft) with sea views from its kitchen, livingroom and diningroom. Daniel Lanois, who produced U2′s 1987 album, The Joshua Tree, alongside Brian Eno, told Hot Press in 2007 that Melbeach was where songs such as Mothers of the Disappeared and Bullet the Blue Sky were born, when it was owned by The Edge. Rarc An Ilan came to market in October 2023 seeking €8 million, and sold for €7.5 million (6 per cent below the guide price) last June, through Knight Frank, according to the PPR. Despite it looking like it has been in situ since Georgian times, the house dates from 1993 when it was purchased by accountant and businessman Howard Kilroy, whom Michael Smurfit described in his autobiography, A Life Worth Living, as “his long-time colleague”. It is understood Kilroy knocked an existing house and built this period-looking home of 318sq m (3,423sq ft) on the 0.6-acre site. Roscommon-based architectural firm Udo Humborg Associates was engaged to ensure original features, such as the old granite steps, lion’s heads and chimney pots, were reinstated. Along with maritime views, Rarc An Ilan offers direct access to the sea, where the water pools in the granite rocks. The new owner is understood to be a tech professional, and will find themself in good company in Dalkey, which Daft research found to be the area with the highest concentration of property millionaires as of 2018. Read our full review here One of the largest properties on Dublin 6′s Dartry Road, and once the childhood home of the late former taoiseach Garret FitzGerald, it is understood Lonsdale has been acquired in an off-market sale conducted by Inhous. Dating from 1884, the detached six-bedroom home, extending to 791sq m (8,514sq ft), is also one of the oldest holdings on the road. The granite-porticoed house comes with half an acre of gardens plus significant frontage to the road and includes an old coach and mews house. A fine example of the classical Victorian revival, it is fitting that the residence has been bought by the Italian embassy as the ambassador’s residence. “There was some domestic interest in the property but they weren’t coming up to the asking price,” says selling agent Barbara Carty. She says it is likely that events will be hosted there, pointing out that there is “half an acre to put up marquees”. Read more here Waverley is a seven-bedroom detached house on an acre of impressive gardens, which came to market seeking €8.45 million in April 2023 through Sherry FitzGerald. It then sold for €7.255 million last July, according to the PPR, 14 per cent below the asking price. Designed for entertaining, and previously rented as an embassy residence, one can picture pyramids of Ferrero Rocher being served while those gathered sip cocktails and explore the vast house and stylish grounds. The vendors bought the premises in the middle of the property boom in 2005 for €7.2 million, then set about completely revamping it: “We kept one or two things,” they told The Irish Times – the double-height nine-panelled front window with a sandstone surround and the portico leading to the front door, for example. But they changed much of the rest of the house, working with architectural firm Frank Ennis & Associates and designer Suzanne Roche. Built in 1999 to look like a stately period home, the completely modern house extends to 698sq m (7513sq ft), has B1 Ber, triple-glazed windows, geothermal central heating and underfloor heating on the ground and first floors. A balcony off the principal bedroom overlooks the back garden and beyond it, Foxrock golf club, on to which the property backs. It has a 46sq m (500sq ft) well-equipped home gym in the building at the bottom of the garden as well as a detached executive office. The garden of Waverley was designed first by Diarmuid Gavin and later by Paul Doyle. It is tended to twice a week by a gardener. Read our full review here Lansdowne Place in Dublin 4 continues to attract buyers with deep pockets. The highest-value sale at the scheme was recorded at €7 million in 2023, with the second most expensive unit, 21 The Templeton – a seventh-floor, three-bedroom penthouse – selling for €6.6 million through joint agents Sherry FitzGerald New Homes and Savills in May this year. The penthouse’s new owner will enjoy floor-to-ceiling vistas of the city in a vast space that extends to 320sq m (3,454sq ft) and includes a terrace of 17sq m (189sq ft), big enough to fit a table for 12. However, it is the further 174sq m (1,879sq ft) of roof terrace above that deliver wow-factor views to the mountains and sea. The owner may even bump into high-profile fellow residents of the scheme, such as pop star Rod Stewart or former Republic of Ireland and Manchester United captain Roy Keane. Read more here Number 3 Churchfields at the K Club is a five-bedroom detached Regency-style residence, extending to 582sq m (6,246sq ft), that was constructed in the late 1990s. The property also contains a detached garage and an annexe which is currently used as a gym studio. It was sold in September for €6 million, according to the PPR, in an off-market deal. It is understood John Bosco French of French Estates advised on the deal. Originally owned by the late racehorse trainer Vincent O’Brien and his wife, Jacqueline, the house may be familiar to hawk-eyed analysts of the PPR as it is listed as having sold for €2.3 million in May 2017 and again for €2.825m in December 2020, and has since been extensively refurbished. Rathbeale Hall in Swords sold for €5.875m in April, according to the PPR. The property is listed on the National Built Heritage Service website as one of architectural, archaeological and artistic note. Dating from about 1680, the detached five-bay, three-storey-over-basement pile was remodelled in 1750 to incorporate a Palladian facade along with flanking wings of two storeys each. It was further extended in 1850 to include a two-storey kitchen block. Kilree Estate, Kilree, Co Kilkenny. (On 535 acres.) Sale price: €1.2m*. Agent: Savills. Property including land understood to have sold for €7.75m. Killough Castle and Farm, Thurles, Co Tipperary. (On 527 acres.) Sale price: €505,000*. Agent: Sherry FitzGerald Country Homes. Property including land understood to have sold for in excess of €6.39m asking price. Tullyard House and Farm, Trim, Co. Meath. (On 189 acres.) Sale price: €900,000*. Agent: Sherry FitzGerald Country Homes. Property including land understood to have sold for slightly under €3.85m asking price. Rathduff Stud, Golden, Cashel, Co Tipperary. (On 95 acres.) Sale price: €850,000*. Agent: Sherry FitzGerald Country Homes. Property including land understood to have sold for €2.675m at auction. Sherry FitzGerald Country Homes reports the sale of Dowth Hall on 11 acres in Co Meath, which it says closed in January 2024, at a price of €11m. The sale has yet to appear on the PPR. © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Bitcoin passes $100,000 milestone

Bitcoin rose above $100,000 for the first time on Thursday as the election of Donald Trump as US president has spurred expectations that his administration will create a friendly environment for cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has more than doubled in value this year and is up about 45% in the four weeks since Trump’s sweeping election victory on Nov 5, when a number of pro-crypto lawmakers were also elected to Congress. Bitcoin was trading around $102,600 (3.51 million baht) late Thursday morning Thailand time. “We’re witnessing a paradigm shift. After four years of political purgatory, bitcoin and the entire digital asset ecosystem are on the brink of entering the financial mainstream,” said Mike Novogratz, founder and CEO of the US crypto firm Galaxy Digital. “This momentum is fueled by institutional adoption, advancements in tokenisation and payments, and a clearer regulatory path.” More than 16 years after its creation, bitcoin appears on the cusp of mainstream acceptance, despite naysayers and a history of controversies. “Bitcoin crossing $100,000 is more than just a milestone; it’s a testament to shifting tides in finance, technology, and geopolitics,” said Justin D’Anethan, a Hong Kong-based crypto analyst. “The figure not that long ago dismissed as fantasy, stands as a reality.” For years a sceptic about crypto, Trump embraced digital assets during his campaign, promising to make the United States the “crypto capital of the planet” and to accumulate a national stockpile of bitcoin. Crypto investors see an end to increased scrutiny under US Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Gary Gensler, who said last week he would step down in January when Trump takes office. On Wednesday, Trump said he would nominate Paul Atkins to run the SEC. Atkins, a former SEC commissioner, has been involved in crypto policy as co-chair of the Token Alliance, which works to “develop best practices for digital asset issuances and trading platforms”, and the Chamber of Digital Commerce. A number of crypto companies including Ripple, Kraken and Circle are jostling for a seat on Trump’s promised crypto advisory council, seeking a say in his planned overhaul of policy, according to digital asset industry executives. Trump’s businesses may also have a stake in the sector. He unveiled a new crypto business, World Liberty Financial, in September. Although details about the business have been scarce, investors have taken his personal interest in the sector as a bullish signal. Trump’s social media company is in advanced talks to buy the crypto trading firm Bakkt, the Financial Times reported last week, citing two people with knowledge of the talks. Trump Media and Technology Group, which operates Truth Social, is close to an all-stock acquisition of Bakkt, according to the FT report. Billionaire Elon Musk, a major Trump ally, is also a proponent of cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin’s rebound from a slide below $16,000 in late 2022 has been rapid, boosted by the approval of US-listed bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January this year. The SEC had long attempted to block ETFs from investing in bitcoin, citing investor protection concerns, but the products have allowed more investors, including institutional investors, to gain exposure to bitcoin. More than $4 billion has streamed into US-listed bitcoin ETFs since the election. “We were trading basically sideways for about seven months, then immediately after Nov 5, US investors resumed buying hand-over-fist,” said Joe McCann, CEO and founder of Asymmetric, a Miami digital assets hedge fund. There was a strong debut for options on a BlackRock ETF in November with call options — bets on the price going up — substantially more popular than puts. McCann calculated the put to call ratio at about 22 to one. Crypto-related stocks have soared along with the bitcoin price, with shares in the bitcoin miner Mara Holdings up around 65% in November. Yet the rise is not without critics. Two years ago, the industry was wracked by scandal with the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange and the jailing of its founder Sam Bankman-Fried. The cryptocurrency industry also has been criticised for its staggering energy usage, while crypto crime remains a concern, too. Market participants are keeping a close eye on what happens now that bitcoin has broken above $100,000, with investors and speculators possibly looking to pocket some of their recent gains. “But once we flush out those sell orders, this could go higher still, and very rapidly,” said Steven McClurg, the founder of Canary Capital, a digital assets investment firm. He said he expects bitcoin to hit $120,000 by Christmas.

Title: SolarZero collapse: Willis demands more answers from NZGIF, Crown agency says BlackRock caught it on the hop

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. Finance Minister Nicola Willis says she still has multiple questions about Crown-backed NZ Green Investment Finance's $145 million credit line for SolarZero installs. Photo / Mark Mitchell A fact-finding day on SolarZero’s collapse has only led to more questions. The Kiwi-founded firm, bought by US private equity giant BlackRock for $110 million in mid-2022, went into liquidation on Tuesday last week, owing more than $40m, including $4.1m to tradies and a similar amount to staff in holiday and notice pay. In August, the NZ Green Investment Fund (NZGIF) set up by the previous Government said it had extended the debt facility it provided to SolarZero to $145m as part of wider credit arrangements involving international lenders that totalled $365m. NZGIF said SolarZero had drawn down $110m by the time of its liquidation. On Thursday morning, NZGIF chairwoman Cecilia Tarrant met with Finance Minister Nicola Willis and Climate Change Minister Simon Watts. Shortly after the meeting, Willis’ office sent a statement saying, “Nicola Willis conveyed her expectation that NZGIF will be publicly accountable for the investment it has made.” She still has questions about: “The failure of SolarZero raised questions about taxpayers’ money being used in this way and those are questions ministers will be giving consideration to,” the statement said. Willis sought assurances about NZGIF’s other investments. These include solar farm start-up Lodestone Energy, to which it provided a $15m working capital facility in FY24. “This facility remains current,” a spokesman told the Herald this afternoon. A full list of its investments has been posted online here. While its various SolarZero debt facilities have been easily the largest bits of business for the self-styled “green bank” (it is not a registered bank), NZGIF has also extended chunky credit lines to EV fleet leasing firm Carbn ($42.4m), UK firm Zenobe ($20m), which is doing work on electrification of businesses in NZ, solar farm firms Far North Solar Farm ($78m) and Lodestone Energy ($15m). And although a lot of NZGIF’s dealings have been with startups, it has also done business with established players including a $1.2m debit facility for Genesis Energy (”to help industry switch from fossil fuels”), a $10m mezzanine debt facility to NZ Post to co-finance $10m spent on electric vans and a $15m “green credit facility” to CentrePort for “accelerating projects to decarbonise Wellington’s port”. As she emerged from her meeting with Willis and Watts, Tarrant initially refused to comment, then said to Newstalk ZB’s Jason Walls: “We do feel very bad, as we all do, about the people who have lost their jobs, but we did not lend to SolarZero the company and we are not responsible for what the company has done.” Tarrant said: “Let’s step back a minute and understand that we did not lend to SolarZero itself. We lent on the receivables; the panels and batteries that were installed on people’s houses and those contracts. Those customers are fine. They are now being serviced by Verofi as the standby servicer who has stepped in to take over from SolarZero.” The NZGIF debt was securitised and held by two special-purpose vehicles, both of which were taken over by the Public Trust shortly before the liquidation. The special purpose vehicles are not in liquidation. The first liquidators report says: “The Liquidators understand that SZL [SolarZero Limited] had underwritten certain aspects of the securitisation, resulting in unsustainable regular payments to the SPVs.” Later on Thursday, Tarrant added in a statement: “Our Shareholding Ministers rightly have questions about how this all happened, and so do we. The change in stance from SolarZero’s owner BlackRock came as a surprise to NZGIF and other lenders, and indeed appears to have caught SolarZero’s CEO off guard given recent public comments. “We are extremely frustrated by this outcome. NZGIF and other international lenders worked to support the growth of this business. BlackRock has not explained its sudden change in stance toward this company, which has severely impacted its staff, suppliers, contractors and partners. “Prior to early November we had no indication from the SolarZero board or BlackRock that the company did not have the support of its owner, which had been funding the ongoing operation of the group. NZGIF takes an active role in monitoring and engaging with investee and client companies and it is fair to say we, along with staff, suppliers and customers, have been shocked by BlackRock’s decision to place the company in liquidation,” Tarrant said. An NZGIF spokesman said earlier that it had less than a day’s notice of BlackRock’s intent to liquidate. The Herald has asked BlackRock for comment. The first liquidators’ report revealed that beyond the $110m it paid for SolarZero, the private equity firm had “injected significant additional capital to the group since its 2022 acquisition, totalling $147.8m”. Liquidators Russell Moore and Stephen Keen, both of Grant Thornton, said the firm had never been profitable. The pair said the total amount owing was still being established. It was not clear at this point if there would be funds to pay secured creditors. Chris Keall is an Auckland-based member of the Herald’s business team. He joined the Herald in 2018 and is the technology editor and a senior business writer. Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read.

Title: To $100,000 and beyond: Bitcoin's wild ride

(Reuters) -Bitcoin broke above $100,000 for the first time on Thursday as the election of Republican Donald Trump as president fuelled bets that his administration will create a friendly regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies. The world's biggest and best-known cryptocurrency has more than doubled from this year's low of $38,505 and is up over 50% since Trump's sweeping election win in early November. Here are key events in bitcoin's journey towards $100,000 and beyond: 2008: Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonym used by the cryptocurrency's presumed developer, introduces the concept of bitcoin 2010: The first retail transaction takes place when a user pays 10,000 bitcoin for two Papa John's (NASDAQ:PZZA) pizzas 2013: As bitcoin's popularity grows, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, co-founders of crypto exchange Gemini, file their first application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to create a spot bitcoin ETF. Grayscale Investments launches the Bitcoin Investment Trust, an open-ended private bitcoin trust. 2016: The Winklevoss brothers adjust their application numerous times, such as the exchange on which the product would be traded. They also file amendments naming State Street (NYSE:STT) as administrator. Grayscale files with the SEC to convert its bitcoin trust into a spot bitcoin ETF. 2017: The SEC rejects the Winklevoss application on the grounds bitcoin markets were not mature enough. Grayscale withdraws its first attempt to convert its trust into an ETF, saying the regulatory environment was not developed enough. 2018: The SEC rejects the Winklevoss twins' second application to launch a spot bitcoin ETF, saying cryptocurrency exchanges do not have the necessary controls to prevent manipulation. 2020: Grayscale transforms its trust into an SEC-reporting entity, and its shares begin trading on the pink sheets, for stocks that trade over the counter. Although not an ETF, it is the first publicly traded bitcoin fund in the U.S. 2021: The first spot bitcoin ETF launches in Canada. Gary Gensler replaces Jay Clayton as SEC chair in April. In October, the SEC approves the ProShares Bitcoin Trust listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, noting the CME has a satisfactory mechanism for surveilling abuse in the futures market. It is the first U.S.-listed futures-based bitcoin ETF, accumulating $1 billion in assets within its first days of trading - faster than any other ETF. Also in October, Grayscale again submits an application to the SEC to convert its trust into a spot bitcoin ETF. 2022: The SEC rejects several applications from would-be spot bitcoin ETF issuers, including SkyBridge, Fidelity and Bitwise. The SEC also rejects Grayscale's application, prompting the company to sue the agency. Amid crashing crypto prices, multiple crypto companies file for bankruptcy, including Three Arrows Capital, Celsius Network and FTX, whose founder Sam Bankman-Fried is also charged with fraud. 2023: May: Cathie Woods' ARK Investments and CBOE Global Markets file for a spot bitcoin ETF, giving the SEC a maximum of 240 days to approve or reject the application. June: BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) files a spot bitcoin ETF application with the SEC, raising industry hopes the agency may approve the product and sending the price of bitcoin to a one-year high. A flurry of other issuers and exchanges, including Fidelity and Invesco, file bitcoin ETF applications in the subsequent weeks and months. August: A federal appeals court in Washington D.C. rules in favour of Grayscale, saying the SEC did not justify why it had rejected its proposal. Europe's first spot bitcoin ETF begins trading on the Euronext (EPA:ENX) Amsterdam stock exchange. October: The SEC opts not to appeal the court's ruling in the Grayscale case and is required to reexamine the application. 2024: Jan. 10: The SEC approves 11 proposals from issuers including BlackRock, Fidelity and VanEck, among others, to launch spot bitcoin ETFs. February: Net inflows into the 10 largest ETFs hit $4 billion in the first month, according to LSEG data. March: Bitcoin tops $70,000 for the first time to hit a record high, having doubled in value in the five months. June: Trump pitches himself as a champion for cryptocurrency and slammed Democrats' attempts to regulate the sector during a San Francisco fundraiser. July: Trump tells a bitcoin conference that, if elected, he will create a strategic national bitcoin stockpile and will ensure the United States is the "crypto capital of the planet." October: The SEC grants "accelerated approval" to U.S. exchanges to list and trade options tied to 11 spot bitcoin ETFs. Nov 6: Trump is declared winner of the presidential election, sparking a huge rally in a range of assets, with bitcoin being the standout gainer. Nov 12: Total (EPA:TTEF) crypto market cap tops $3 trillion. Year-to-date ETF net inflows hit $25.8 billion, according to LSEG data. Nov 21: Bitcoin nears $100,000 for the first time in history, driven by a swell of buying from investors in anticipation of Trump dismantling a lot of the regulation around crypto investment. Dec. 5: Bitcoin soars past $100,000 for the first time, taking its gains for the year to over 140%.

Latest Topics The Nightly Topics The price of bitcoin soared past the long-awaited $US100,000 benchmark for the first time ever late Wednesday evening. The flagship cryptocurrency was last higher by more than 5 per cent at $101,072.00, according to Coin Metrics. Earlier, it rose as high as $101,555.40. The move came hours after President-elect Donald Trump announced plans to nominate Paul Atkins as chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, a move viewed by the crypto community as being in keeping with his promise not just to replace Gary Gensler — who has become something of a villain in crypto for the agency’s regulation-by-enforcement approach to the industry under his leadership — but to set up a more supportive regulatory environment for the crypto industry more broadly.

In the same day, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said bitcoin is “just like gold only it’s virtual, it’s digital,” speaking at the DealBook conference. He further clarified that “people are not using it as a form of payment, or as a store of value” and that “it’s not a competitor for the dollar, it’s really a competitor for gold.” It’s a day of celebration for longtime bitcoin investors, who have held on for dear life, or “HODL’d” through several of the cryptocurrency’s boom and bust cycles, during which government and financial institutions remained dismissive — and even hostile — toward the asset class. That’s largely because of the cryptocurrency’s anti-establishment roots. The original idea for Bitcoin was proposed at the height of the 2008 financial crisis: a “peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution,” its founder, Satoshi Nakamoto, wrote in the Bitcoin Whitepaper. In recent years, however, the industry has demonstrated the value of bitcoin to much of the institutional investing world. BlackRock, Fidelity, Invesco and others launched the first spot bitcoin ETFs at the beginning of this year — bitcoin’s “IPO” moment — and the growing demand for them by institutions has helped drive the price higher. In November, Rick Wurster, the incoming CEO of Charles Schwab, said the firm is preparing to enter spot crypto trading, pending regulatory changes expected in the next Trump administration. “We’re witnessing a paradigm shift. After four years of political purgatory, bitcoin and the entire digital asset ecosystem are on the brink of entering the financial mainstream,” Mike Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Digital, told CNBC. Bitcoin has been widely expected to reach the landmark $100,000 level since the U.S. presidential election. However, excited investors sent bitcoin closer to this mark much sooner than initially anticipated; it rose as high as $99,849.99 on Nov. 22. There is much hope that President-elect Donald Trump will deliver on several pro-crypto initiatives in the year ahead – including the establishment of a national strategic bitcoin reserve or stockpile, no taxes on crypto transactions and opening up the crypto public equity markets with more IPOs. “Over the long term, I’m bullish,” Novogratz added. “It won’t be a straight line up, and investors should always consider taking gains off the table. But, with a pro-crypto administration about to take charge in the U.S., it’ll be hard for the rest of the world not to take notice.” Copy Link Copied Government accused of inflaming anti-Semitism as Australian Jews become targets of ‘domestic terrorism’.

Title: Bitcoin hits $100k - and seven other wild moments in its history

The price of Bitcoin has for the first time broken past the $100,000 mark, hitting a new record high. The value of the world's biggest cryptocurrency has been boosted by hopes US President-elect Donald Trump will adopt crypto-friendly policies. The milestone was reached hours after Trump said he would nominate former Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) commissioner Paul Atkins to run the Wall Street regulator. Mr Atkins is seen as being far more pro-cryptocurrency than the current head of the SEC, Gary Gensler. The $100,000 milestone prompted celebrations from cryptocurrency fans around the world. Bitcoin's wildly fluctuating value has always attracted interest, with its backers reacting with delight when it has passed previous price thresholds - and defiance during its slumps. But this particular landmark has been especially keenly anticipated. For weeks charts, memes and predictions have swirled around social media about when the price would hit the figure thought to be one of the holy grails of the crypto world. Millions of viewers even tuned in to online watch parties as the price hovered close to $100k. The value of a single bitcoin is one of the barometers of optimism in the cryptocurrency industry which is now estimated to be worth $3.3tn, according to analysis firm Coin Market Cap. Trump's election victory last month was the catalyst for the latest surge. The president-elect has vowed to make the US "the crypto capital of the planet" - a remarkable turnaround given as recently as 2021 he was calling Bitcoin a "scam." Also remarkable is just how Bitcoin's price has rocketed. A valuation of $100k represents a 40% increase on election day in the U.S. and more than double the price it started the year at. But there's lots more to Bitcoin than the dizzying changes in its value. From its enigmatic inventor to the bringing down of the so-called Crypto King, it's a story with many twists and turns, which has seen the making - and losing - of huge fortunes. So here's the BBC's list of the seven wildest moments - so far - in Bitcoin's tumultuous history. Despite its enormous profile, no-one actually knows for sure who invented Bitcoin. The idea for it was posted on internet forums in 2008 by someone calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto. They explained how a peer-to-peer digital cash system could work to enable people to send virtual coins over the internet, just as easily as sending an email. Satoshi created a complex computer system that would process transactions and create new coins using a huge network of self-appointed volunteers around the world who used special software and powerful computers. But he - or they - never revealed their identity, and the world has never worked it out. In 2014, Japanese-American man Dorian Nakamoto was pursued by reporters who thought he was the elusive Bitcoin creator, but it proved to be a false lead caused by some mistranslated information. Australian computer scientist Craig Wright said it was him in 2016 - but after years of legal battles, a High Court judge concluded he was not Satoshi. Earlier this year, a Canadian Bitcoin expert called Peter Todd strongly denied being Satoshi, while in London this month a British man, Stephen Mollah, claimed he was - but no-one believed him. Bitcoin now underpins a two trillion-dollar cryptocurrency industry - but the first recorded transaction using it was the purchase of pizza. On 22 May 2010, Lazlo Hanyecz, offered $41 worth of Bitcoin on a crypto forum in return for two pizzas. A 19-year-old student obliged and the day went down in history for fans of the currency as #BitcoinPizza day. A source of memes for those in crypto community, it also showcased the power of Bitcoin - an internet money that could genuinely buy items online. Criminals must have been watching too, because within a year the first darknet marketplace was launched selling drugs and other illegal goods in exchange for Bitcoin. The deal looks pretty bad for Lazlo now too. If he had held onto those coins they would now be worth hundreds of millions of dollars! In September 2021, President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador, central America, made Bitcoin legal tender. Hairdressers, supermarkets and other shops had to accept Bitcoin by law, alongside its main currency, the US dollar. Many Bitcoin enthusiasts and reporters visited the area, briefly boosting tourism to the country. While President Bukele hoped the move would increase investment in his country and cut costs for citizens exchanging money, it did not become as popular as he hoped. He is still hoping it will take off but for now the US dollar still remains king in the country. As well as the huge amount of public money President Bukele spent on trying to make people embrace Bitcoin he also, controversially, bought more than 6,000 bitcoins over the past few years. The president spent at least $120m buying up bitcoins at various prices in the hope of making a profit for his cash-strapped country. It started to look good for him in December 2023 when, for the first time, his stash skyrocketed in value. A website built by Dutch software engineer Elias Zerrouq is tracking the country's Bitcoin holdings and currently estimates that the coins have risen 98% in value. In 2021, Kazakhstan became a hotspot for Bitcoin mining - the process of crunching through the complex calculations that underpin crypto transactions. These days it takes warehouses full of the latest computers running all day and all night, but the reward is brand new bitcoins for those companies that take part. Warehouses of computers require lots of power - and many businesses moved to Kazakhstan where electricity was abundant thanks to huge coal reserves. At first the government welcomed them with open arms as they brought investment. But too many miners arrived and put huge strain on the electricity grid, putting the country at risk of blackouts. Within a year, Kazakhstan's Bitcoin mining industry went from boom to bust as the government imposed restrictions and increased taxes to curb the growth. Around the world it is estimated that the Bitcoin network uses as much electricity as a small country, raising concerns about its environmental impact. Imagine having a crypto wallet worth more than $100m (£78m) - and then accidentally throwing away a hard drive containing the login details. That's what James Howells, from south Wales, says happened to him The very nature of crypto means that recovery is not as easy as resetting your password. With no banks involved - there is no customer support helpline. Unfortunately for him, his local council in Newport refused to let him access the landfill site where he says the device ended up - even after he offered to donate 25% of his Bitcoin stash to local charities if they let him. He told the BBC: "It was a penny dropping moment and it was a sinking feeling." No-one has lost as much Bitcoin as former billionaire crypto mogul, Sam Bankman-Fried. The founder of the massive crypto firm FTX was nicknamed the Crypto King and loved by the community. FTX was a cryptocurrency exchange that allowed people to trade normal money for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. His empire was worth an estimated $32bn and he was flying high until everything came crashing down within days. Journalists had discovered that Bankman-Fried's company was financially shaky and had been illegally transferring FTX customer funds to prop up his other company, Alameda Research. Just before his arrest at his luxury apartment complex in the Bahamas in December 2022 he spoke to reporters. He told the BBC: "I don't think I committed fraud. I didn't want any of this to happen. I was certainly not nearly as competent as I thought I was." After being extradited to the US he was found guilty of fraud and money laundering and was jailed for 25 years. Despite all the turmoil, Bitcoin continues to attract attention from investors and big companies. In fact, in January 2024, some of the biggest financial firms in the world added Bitcoin to their official asset lists as Spot Bitcoin ETFs. These are like stocks and shares, linked to the value of Bitcoin but you don't have to personally own any. Customers have been pouring billions into these brand new products. Companies including Blackrock, Fidelity and GrayScale, have also been buying up Bitcoins in their thousands, pushing up its value to record highs. It is a huge milestone for crypto with some fans believing that Bitcoin is finally being taken as seriously as the mysterious Satoshi imagined. Nonetheless, few would back against more wild moments as the Bitcoin story continues to unfold. Haliey Welch's "Hawk" digital coin shot up in price then lost 95% of its value just hours after it launched. James Howells believes the hard drive is now worth about £600m since the recent Bitcoin surge. Ann Jensen, from Salisbury, was tricked into investing by a deepfake of Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Justin Sun described Maurizio Cattelan's infamous 2019 work as "much better than other bananas". New evidence suggests the YouTuber promoted investments without revealing his financial interest in them. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

By Thursday afternoon, the flagship cryptocurrency pulled back from the milestone. It was recently higher by 0.28% at $99,140.00, according to Coin Metrics, trading at the lows of Thursday's trading following some profit taking by investors. On Wednesday night, it rose as high as $103,844.05. The move came after President-elect Donald Trump announced plans to nominate Paul Atkins as chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The appointment could fulfill Trump's most important campaign promise to the crypto industry: to replace Gary Gensler, who has become something of a villain in crypto for the agency's regulation-by-enforcement approach to the industry under his leadership.

Title: Bitcoin Hits Major Milestone of $100K, Nears $2 Trillion Market Value

Bitcoin's price has surged past the $100,000 mark for the first time in its history, fueled by institutional demand, corporate accumulation and heightened expectations of crypto-friendly policies under Donald Trump's presidency. Now ahead about 130% year-to-date, bitcoin's market capitalization has risen to just shy of $2 trillion only 15 years after coming into existence. For reference, Nvidia and Apple sport market caps of about $3.5 trillion, Microsoft $3 trillion, and Google and Amazon $2.2 trillion. The market capitalization of all the gold in the world is roughly $17.7 trillion. At the forefront of this rally was the early-2024 launch of spot-based bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) by asset management giants including BlackRock and Fidelity. These products have been a resounding success, securing assets under management of around $30 billion in less than one year's time. Despite the success of the ETFs, the move higher in bitcoin seemingly stalled throughout a large chunk of this year, at least in part thanks to regulatory uncertainty surrounding the U.S. presidential election. The early November victory of crypto-friendly Donald Trump, though, spurred new legs for the rally, with bitcoin quickly taking out its March high above $73,500, then in fast time moving past $80,000, then $90,000, and finally $100,000 just minutes ago. Read more: Crypto Foe and SEC Chair Gary Gensler Will Quit When Trump Takes Office Another large part of the bull story is growing corporate adoption, led by MicroStrategy (MSTR) and its Executive Chairman Michael Saylor. The company — which began its bitcoin purchases in August 2020 — has continued to raise billions of dollars to deploy into bitcoin, taking its holdings to 386,700 tokens which are now worth more than $38 billion. Saylor and team have inspired other publicly traded companies, U.S.-listed Semler Scientific and Japan-listed Metaplanet among them, to pursue similar strategies. Even tech giant Microsoft has a proposal before its board as to whether it should pursue a bitcoin treasury strategy.

(Reuters) -Bitcoin catapulted above $100,000 for the first time on Thursday, a milestone hailed even by sceptics as a coming-of-age for digital assets as investors bet on a friendly U.S. administration to cement the place of cryptocurrencies in financial markets. Once it broke $100,000 in Thursday's Asian morning, boosted by U.S. President-elect Trump's nomination of pro-crypto Paul Atkins to run the Securities and Exchange Commission, it was soon at an all-time high of $103,649. It last fetched $98,803, up 0.95% on the day. The total value of the cryptocurrency market has almost doubled over the year so far to hit a record over $3.8 trillion, according to data provider CoinGecko. By comparison, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) alone is worth about $3.7 trillion. Bitcoin's march from the libertarian fringe to Wall Street has minted millionaires, a new asset class and popularised the concept of "decentralised finance" in a volatile and often controversial period since its creation 16 years ago. Bitcoin has more than doubled in value this year and is up more than 50% in the four weeks since Donald Trump's sweeping election victory, which also saw a slew of pro-crypto lawmakers being elected to Congress. "CONGRATULATIONS BITCOINERS!!! $100,000!!! YOU’RE WELCOME!!! Together, we will Make America Great Again!" Trump said on Truth Social, his social media network, on Thursday. "We're witnessing a paradigm shift," said Mike Novogratz, founder and CEO of U.S. crypto firm Galaxy Digital (TSX:GLXY). "Bitcoin and the entire digital asset ecosystem are on the brink of entering the financial mainstream - this momentum is fuelled by institutional adoption, advancements in tokenisation and payments, and a clearer regulatory path." Trump - who once labelled crypto a scam - embraced digital assets during his campaign, promising to make the United States the "crypto capital of the planet" and to accumulate a national stockpile of bitcoin. "We were trading basically sideways for about seven months, then immediately after Nov. 5, U.S. investors resumed buying hand-over-fist," said Joe McCann, CEO and founder of Asymmetric, a Miami digital assets hedge fund. Bitcoin's proponents cheered Trump's nomination of Atkins to the SEC. A former SEC commissioner, Atkins has been involved in crypto policy as co-chair of the Token Alliance, which works to "develop best practices for digital asset issuances and trading platforms," and the Chamber of Digital Commerce. "Atkins will offer a new perspective, anchored by a deep understanding of the digital asset ecosystem," said Blockchain Association CEO Kristin Smith. "We look forward to working with him ... and ushering in – together – a new wave of American crypto innovation." A slew of crypto companies including Ripple, Kraken and Circle are also jostling for a seat on Trump's promised crypto advisory council. PART OF THE LANDSCAPE Bitcoin has proven a survivor through precipitous downturns. Its move into six-figure territory is a remarkable comeback from a dip below $16,000 in 2022 when the industry was reeling from the collapse of the FTX exchange. Founder Sam Bankman-Fried was subsequently jailed. Analysts say the growing embrace of bitcoin by big investors this year has been a driving force behind the record-breaking rally. U.S.-listed bitcoin exchange-traded funds were approved in January and have been a conduit for large-scale buying, with more than $4 billion streaming into these funds since the election. "Roughly 3% of the total supply of bitcoins that will ever exist have been purchased in 2024 by institutional money," said Geoff Kendrick, global head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF). "Digital assets, as an asset class, is becoming normalised," he said. It is already becoming increasingly financialised, with the launch of bitcoin futures in 2017 and a strong debut for options on BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s ETF in November. Crypto-related stocks have soared along with the bitcoin price, with shares in bitcoin miner MARA Holdings and exchange operator Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) each up around 65% in November. Software (ETR:SOWGn) firm Microstrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR), which has repeatedly raised funds to buy bitcoin and held an aggregate of about 402,100 bitcoins as of Dec. 1, has gained around 540% this year. Trump himself unveiled a new crypto business, World Liberty Financial, in September, although details have been scarce and billionaire Elon Musk, a major Trump ally, is also a proponent of cryptocurrencies. Some say the asset remains a speculative or investment vehicle and not an instrument for payments. On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell likened bitcoin to gold, “only it's virtual, it's digital." "People are not using it as a form of payment, or as a store of value. It's highly volatile, it’s not a competitor for the dollar." While earlier big bitcoin rallies have been followed by significant pullbacks, its wider adoption now may help tamp down volatility, analysts said. "That is not to say that there will not be 30-50% drawdowns over time, but my base case is that the nature of the drawdowns will be less severe than what we saw in the last bear market," Sean Farrell, head of digital asset strategy at Fundstrat Global Advisors, said. "Passive flows into ETFs, a liquid options market, corporate treasury adoption, and nation state adoption will likely play a large role in dampening volatility," Farrell said. 'WHO CAN PROHIBIT IT' Cryptocurrencies have been criticised for their massive energy consumption and use in crime around the world, and the underlying technology is far from delivering a revolution in the way money moves around the globe. The U.S. and Britain announced on Wednesday they had disrupted what they described as a global money laundering ring which used cryptocurrency to help rich Russians to evade sanctions and launder cash for drug traffickers. Although calculations vary, the Cambridge University Centre for Alternative Finance estimates bitcoin uses around the same amount of electricity each year as Poland or South Africa. Still, as Russian President Vladimir Putin pointed out at an investment conference on Wednesday: "Who can prohibit it? No one." And its longevity is perhaps testament to a degree of resilience. "As time goes by it's proving itself as part of the financial landscape," said Shane Oliver, chief economist and head of investment strategy at AMP (OTC:AMLTF) in Sydney. "I find it very hard to value it ... it's anyone's guess. But it does have a momentum aspect to it and at the moment the momentum is up."

Title: Bitcoin Whale Resurfaces After 11 Years After Its BTC’s Value Rose Over 15,000%

A Bitcoin whale that had been inactive for 11 years has resurfaced with a transaction of around $257 million in BTC after seeing the price of their holdings surge by over 15,300% since their last action. According to data shared by on-chain analysis service Lookonchain, the long-dormant Bitcoin whale received 2,700 BTC back in December 2013 when the price of the cryptocurrency was at $625.84. Since then, BTC’s price rose more than 15,300% to now stand at $96,320. Bitcoin whale movements are notable as they can influence the price of the flagship cryptocurrency, with whales from around the era of BTC creator Satoshi Nakamoto, who disappeared back in 2010, being especially influential and closely watched. The whale resurfaced at a time in which the total amount of Bitcoin exchange reserves has dropped to its lowest level in years after massive outflows have been seen since the US presidential election in early November led to a massive cryptocurrency market rally. According to data from on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant, over 171,000 BTC have moved off of cryptocurrency trading platforms since Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump won the election, leading to a market rally given his pro-crypto stance during the campaign. As CryptoGlobe reported, Bitcoin whales have been steadily accumulating over the last few weeks as BTC trades below the psychological resistance level around $100,000. CryptoQuant data shows that 16,000 BTC worth nearly $1.5 billion entered whale reserves in a single day late last month. A lower amount of Bitcoin on exchanges suggests that there is less supply available on the market, which if coupled with steady or rising demand could lead to a cryptocurrency price rise. The price of Bitcoin has been strolling to surpass the $100,000 psychological barrier after surging exponentially after Trump secured the US elections. The cryptocurrency is, at the time of writing, trading at $96.700 after moving up more than 40% in the last month. While whales are accumulating, the total holdings of the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) offered by the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, have grown to surpass the 500,000 BTC mark. Another entity heavily accumulating the flagship cryptocurrency is Nasdaq-listed business intelligence firm MicroStrategy, which accumulated an additional 15,400 coins for $1.5 billion earlier this month to bring its total BTC holdings above the 400,000 threshold.

In this article, we’ll be summarizing a bullish thesis posted on VIC covering Aspen Aerogels, Inc. (NYSE:ASPN) in October, when the stock was trading at $21.86. Currently, ASPN stock is trading at $14.83, which shows that the stock has dipped since the publication of this thesis. Nonetheless, ASPN stock is now trading at a forward PE ratio (non-GAAP) of 38.44, and the stock is trading at 2.70 times, forward sales estimates. A technician meticulously inspecting a corrosion-resistant insulation panel for a fire-protection system. As a leading proponent of aerogel technology, Aspen Aerogels, Inc. (ASPN) offers cutting-edge thermal management solutions for sectors including sustainable building insulation, energy infrastructure, electric vehicles (EVs), and industry. Its PyroThin® insulation tackles critical EV problems including thermal runaway in lithium-ion batteries, placing Aspen as a major player in an industry expected to reach over 100 million vehicles by 2030. In order to improve energy efficiency and sustainability, the company's aerogels are also extensively applied in projects related to energy infrastructure like petrochemical plants and LNG facilities. Growing environmental and legislative concerns have helped Aspen since its products fulfill strict energy efficiency criteria and ESG targets. The company obtained a $150 million DOE loan in 2023 to grow its Georgia plant, raising PyroThin® manufacturing capacity. This development helps it to satisfy growing demand both domestically and abroad, especially as EV safety rules tighten worldwide. Aspen's long-term income from that relationship may be lowered by GM's move toward prismatic battery cells, but diversification among other OEMs and industrial uses as well as Aspen's larger prospects in cylindrical and pouch cell markets should help to offset this impact. Driven by increasing demand in the EV industry and industrial uses, Aspen's growth path has been distinguished by constant upward changes in revenue projection. Its capacity to boost guidance several times in 2024 highlights the confidence of management and the resilience of its plan. Aspen's strategic efforts in growing production and enhancing operational efficiency, together with its central role in energy-efficient markets, help it to be positioned for continuous growth despite hazards like pricing constraints and EV market dependency. The company's competitive edge in highly sought-after markets is cemented by its alignment with federal sustainability projects and developing industry trends. Aspen Aerogels, Inc.

Title: Stocks Buoyed by Tech Rally With Powell in Focus: Markets Wrap

Full Content:
(Bloomberg) -- A rally in the world’s largest technology companies drove stocks higher, with traders wading through the latest economic data and awaiting Jerome Powell’s remarks for clues on the Federal Reserve’s next steps. Treasuries rose and the dollar fluctuated. Equities headed toward all-time highs, with the S&P 500 set for its 56th closing record in 2024. The Nasdaq 100 climbed about 1%. Nvidia Corp. led a gauge of the “Magnificent Seven” megacaps higher as the group extended this year’s surge to 62%. Salesforce Inc. jumped 9% and Marvell Technology Inc. soared 24% as their results boosted hopes both companies will keep benefiting from an industrywide boom in artificial intelligence. Just days ahead of the key jobs report, data showed employment at US companies remained firm in November while services activity expanded at the slowest pace in three months. Powell participates in a moderated discussion later Wednesday, and one of his favorite barometers of the economy — the Beige Book — will likely reflect the post-election surge in sentiment. “Right now, the odds favor another cut this month followed by a pause in January, but a significant change in the jobs landscape could rearrange those puzzle pieces,” said Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley. The S&P 500 rose 0.4%. The Nasdaq 100 climbed 0.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.4%. European stocks advanced for a fifth consecutive session as German shares hit a fresh record. Investors were watching the no-confidence vote taking place in France. Treasury 10-year yields declined four basis points to 4.18%. The market-implied odds of a quarter-point Fed cut this month have improved to around 70%. Additionally, a cumulative 80 basis points of easing is priced in by the end of next year. To George Smith at LPL Financial, momentum could continue for stocks as December has been a good month for market seasonals. It’s overall the second-best performing month since 1950 — with a 1.6% average gain — and the third-strongest over the past five years, according to Smith. When studying the proportion of positive monthly returns since 1950, December often delivers the highest proportion of positive monthly returns — around 74%. Despite the seasonality, Smith doesn’t out the possibility of short-term weakness, especially as geopolitical threats have the potential to escalate. Equities may also need to readjust to what may be a slower and shallower Fed rate-cutting cycle than markets are currently pricing in, he noted. “We remain tactically bullish into year-end given the positive macro environment, earnings growth, and a Fed that remains supportive of markets,” wrote JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Market Intelligence Team led by Andrew Tyler. “It is sensible to play the market’s momentum and see low pullback potential until mid-January,” they say. To some technical analysts who watch and analyze price moves, and strategists that keep an eye on investor sentiment, the initial rumblings are starting to sound a lot like a stock market that has overheated. A Bank of America Corp. indicator that tracks sell-side strategists’ average recommendations remains at its highest level since early 2022, in neutral territory, but much closer to a contrarian “sell” signal than a “buy.” “Statistically (and paradoxically), the impact of 2024’s big gains has made the market look riskier for long-term investors, but potentially safer for near-term speculators,” the Leuthold Group’s Doug Ramsey wrote this week. Leuthold’s major trend index (MTI) — which takes into account many different kinds of indicators — remains at a “high neutral,” but all of the indexes in the MTI closed last week with maximum-bullish readings. All the short-term positioning, rally chasing and mechanical buying flow speaks to an attitude of just running with the market tide. That doesn’t stop the potential for things to change when the calendar flips into 2025. “To put it simply, and probably no one wants to hear it, but this is not a good set up — investors and speculators alike have been lulled into permabull paradise,” writes Callum Thomas at Topdown Charts. Investors have their hopes up for a Santa Claus rally, but a healthy dose of skepticism might be warranted after November’s stellar run-up, according to Callie Cox at Ritholtz Wealth Management. “The bar for success is now a lot higher for an economy that may still be in flux,” Cox said. “Yields show that expectations have moved a lot over the past two months, yet we haven’t seen any sustained, clear momentum in economic data. Expectations matter, and the job market is under a microscope.” To Mark Hackett at Nationwide, the sustainability of the market rally will be dependent on the continued resilience of the consumer. One of the best forecasters of consumer spending is the health of the job market. “Markets continue to be driven by a combination of technical and fundamental factors,” Hackett noted. “The consistency of the rally is demoralizing to bears, creating a ‘virtuous circle’ where buying drives further buying. There are questions of sustainability into 2025 given elevated expectations and valuations, but that is unlikely to derail the near-term momentum.” Appetite for equities has shown no sign of abating this year. The S&P 500 made multiple record highs, surging over 25%, powered by technology shares and a broad preference for US assets. The rally extended after the election of Donald Trump raised hopes of tax cuts and deregulation. While American equities have persistently outpaced their global peers, BlackRock Investment Institute says that could continue. The US benefits more from “mega forces,” driving corporate earnings, the firm notes. That is supported by a favorable growth outlook plus potential tax cuts and regulatory easing. “Some valuation measures – whether price-to-earnings ratios or equity risk premiums – look rich relative to history. But they may not tell the full story,” according to BII. “Comparing today’s index to that of the past is like comparing apples to oranges. Plus, valuations tend to matter more for returns over a long-term horizon than in the near term.” BII says the AI mega force will likely benefit US stocks more and that’s why the firm stays overweight, particularly relative to global peers such as European stocks. “The upshot: We are risk-on for now, but stay nimble. Key signposts for changing our view include any surge in long-term bond yields or an escalation in trade protectionism,” BII concluded.

US stocks ended higher on Wednesday, jumping to fresh highs as traders took in Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's optimistic comments on the US economy. The S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average all closed at records, with the Dow topping 45,000 for the first time ever. All eyes were on Powell in the afternoon, when the central bank chief spoke on the strength of the economy at The New York Times' DealBook Summit. "Growth is definitely stronger than we thought, and inflation is coming a little higher," Powell said at the event. "The good news is that we can afford to be a little more cautious as we try to find neutral," he added, referring to the neutral interest rate, a hypothetical level where rates neither expand nor contract the economy. Traders also took in weaker-than-expected private jobs data. Private payrolls rose just 146,000 in the last month, lower than the expected 163,000, according to ADP. Bets that the Fed will cut rates another 25 basis points at their December policy meeting also surged, with investors now pricing in a 78% chance the central bank will issue another quarter-point cut. Odds for a further 25 basis point cut in January held steady at 18%.

Title: Why Walmart Inc. (WMT) Is the Best Retail Stock to Invest in

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Retail Stocks To Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) stands against the other best retail stocks to invest in. On December 2, Lindsey Bell, Chief Strategist at 248 Ventures, appeared on CNBC to discuss the consumer and economy in the holiday shopping season and the impact of proposed tariffs and the strong dollar on earnings. She said that the economy will see a resilient consumer, economy, and marketplace this week and at the end of the year. Bell expressed optimism going into the end of the year and was of the view that there is opportunity in retail at the present after staying in the shadows as a forgotten area. As consumers have shifted in how they spend money and what they spend it on over the last several years, the retail sector is starting to see a comeback to discretionary items. Although an opportunity exists, retailers can only avail of it if they have the right merchandise at the right price or offer the right experience for the consumer. This is because the consumer is still value-oriented and price-sensitive simultaneously. Concerns are circulating in the retail industry about the potential effects of "tariff threats" on the economy. Bell was of the view that it is undoubtedly necessary to stay on top of the potential threats that the president-elect's proposed tariffs might cause to the markets. However, she took us back to Trump's first term as a president and the tariff increases he made, that Joe Biden continued in his term, highlighting that there wasn't a significant lasting inflationary impact to them. She explained how tariffs work, saying that they go up when put on and have an impact in the near term, but eventually subside over time. The markets saw that in 2018 and 2019, while real inflation came in 2021 and 2022 with the pandemic. She reiterated that although the tariffs are something we need to keep an eye on, the scenario is not something we need to worry about from a consumer perspective this holiday shopping season. Although the tariffs may not pose threats to consumers, what do they mean for investors? With the dollar up by half a percent at the time of the interview, concerns are rising about the dollar's possible strength going into the next earnings season and the possible impact on rates that these "tariff threats" might bring about. Bell agreed that the dollar's strength impacts the earnings season, as about 50% of the S&P 500 gets its revenues from overseas multinational companies. She said that the dollar's strength can continue into the year ahead, but this is a relative game. It is important to consider the currency and the strength of the economy around the world, as a strong dollar does depict a strong economy here in the US.

For this article, we used the Finviz stock screener to identify around 40 retail stocks and narrowed our list to 10 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund holders, as of fiscal Q3 2024. We sourced the hedge fund data from Insider Monkey's database. The stocks are arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 88 Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is an omnichannel retailer that operates retail and wholesale stores and clubs, e-commerce websites, and mobile applications. It offers an elaborate array of items, ranging from general merchandise and electronics to food, groceries, and more. The company's fiscal Q3 2025 earnings showed sales growing by 6.1% in constant currency and profit growing by 9.8%. E-commerce was one of the primary drivers of growth worldwide, up 27%. Other growth drivers included advertising and membership income, which grew by 28% and 22%, respectively. These trends allowed the company to grow profits faster than sales while simultaneously working to lower prices and invest in its associates. The rapid growth from these newer businesses is allowing Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) to strengthen its business model. It is continuing to gain market share in the US in both general merchandise and grocery. Further trends in the US in fiscal Q3 2024 saw growing in-store volumes, faster curbside pickup, and an increase in delivery sales. There was no like-for-like inflation in the US in fiscal Q3 2025. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is becoming more convenient for its customers and members, and that is helping it drive growth. Overall, WMT ranks 1st on our list of best retail stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of retail stocks, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

The former Red Bull executive is faced with turning around investor perceptions amid pressure on shares. Shares of connected TV platform company Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU) jumped Wednesday morning after Needham analyst Laura Martin said she believes that Roku will be acquired at a hefty premium in 2025. As of 11:30 a.m. ET, Roku stock was up by 10.5%. Likely in response, Walmart decided to acquire Roku rival Vizio, a deal that closed Tuesday. The bull market looks to be in full force as valuations continue to rise higher for many stocks. Three of these hot stocks that investors should be extra careful about these days are MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR), Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR), and CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD). Although they have generated some fantastic returns for investors, you may want to consider taking a second look at these stocks before deciding to invest in them, as their valuations are at absurdly high levels. US president Joe Biden made a mistake in not embracing Elon Musk, his predecessor Bill Clinton has said, after the Tesla boss donated millions to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign. Elon Musk is on another level this year. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO added $119 billion to his fortune in 2024. This pushed his net worth to $348 billion. That's not just a number. It's more than the entire net worth of tech icon Michael Dell. Let that sink in. Musk isn't alone in raking it in, though. The 10 biggest wealth gainers globally have seen their fortunes grow by a combined $585 billion this year, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

Title: Why Vertiv Holdings (VRT) Will Be a Major Beneficiary of AI

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Stocks That Will Benefit From AI. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Vertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT) stands against other stocks that will benefit from AI. Artificial intelligence has been the driving theme of the stock market over the past couple of years which have seen investors battle inflation and high interest rates. Ever since OpenAI publicly released ChatGPT in November 2022 and NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang predicted the next year that there was a trillion-dollar market in play when it came to upgrading traditional computing hardware to accelerated computing, the stock market has seen no respite. However, when it comes to AI stocks, not all of them have flourished. Apart from Huang's firm, the world's leading graphics processing unit (GPU) designer, shares of OpenAI's biggest backer, i.e., the firm known for the Windows operating system, were two of the biggest initial AI beneficiaries. Between December 2022 and H1 2024, their shares have gained 631% and 75%, respectively. Other technology stocks have also ridden the AI wave and have posted gains ranging between 42% to 308%. Within these, the stock that has gained 308% is Facebook's parent entity and its focus on GPU investments and success with the Llama open source model have caught investor attention. These firms have primarily posted gains because the AI wave, as analysts would like to remind you, is in its early stages. This stage is characterized by investor interest in firms that are AI enablers. However, the next stage of AI investment could see investors broaden their horizons. Some of this diversification away from technology stocks has already taken place in the form of impressive performance by utility stocks in 2024. Their performance is evident through the utility component of the flagship S&P index gaining 28% from the start of the year to the end of November as it led the benchmark index by a percentage point. We analyzed this stage in AI investment in great detail as part of our coverage of Goldman Sachs’ Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks. Stocks in this list range from utility firms to computer hardware providers, semiconductor firms, and glass companies. Within this list, data center hardware firms were quite common, and as you read below, you'll find out why they might be the biggest beneficiaries of the next wave in AI investment. Wells Fargo has extensively covered the topic of what other stocks apart from the most valuable in the world can benefit from artificial intelligence. Its research covers firms that benefit from AI spending and applications. Starting from stocks that might benefit from AI spending, the bank notes that these will primarily include areas where the money trickles from AI data spending. In 2025, it estimates that hyperscaler cloud providers' capital expenditures can sit around a cool $180 billion. This is more than twice the expected spending by oil majors, which is estimated to sit at close to $85 billion. So where will this money trickle down to? Well, WF believes that while the "largest portion of cost involved in constructing data centers is graphics processing units (GPUs) and the supercomputers that contain them," other sectors that should not be ignored include "cabling; steel racks; cooling (liquid and air); electrical equipment (both inside and outside the box); and backup generators" along with others that "are required to lay the foundation and power generation to support the facility." While it lists down the usual culprits of information technology, communications services, and software firms that are part of discretionary stocks as the beneficiaries of data center spending, WF also adds two other sectors. These are industrial and material stocks, as the bank believes that while a "data center may not be a factory, but if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it might be a duck." It quotes research to share that since as much as 45% of the cost of building a data center "is related to land, building shell, and basic building fit-out," firms that "supply steel, aggregates, cement, and water equipment and, by extension, construction and engineering firms as well as broad non-residential construction suppliers (such as industrial distributors)" can benefit from the $180 billion in estimated hyperscaler capital expenditure. WF adds that data center spending will also include electrical and HVAC systems, as it notes that this sector can benefit from the fact that "there are a relatively limited number of scaled suppliers of large electrical equipment, commercial HVAC systems, and diesel generators."

Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 91 Vertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT) is a computer hardware company that designs and sells power management, racks, cooling equipment, and other associated equipment. It is one of the top-performing stocks in 2024 as the shares are up 180% year-to-date. Vertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT) has been an investor favorite particularly since it also sells liquid cooling products. These are indispensable for AI workloads due to the excessive heat generated by performance-intensive GPUs. The firm is particularly exposed to the data center industry as it generates 75% of its revenue from this industry. The positive catalysts from AI-generated demand were also evident in Vertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT)'s third quarter results. These saw the firm grow sales by 19% and orders by 37%. Therefore, the year-to-date share price gain is unsurprising. Baron Small Cap Fund mentioned Vertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT) in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: “Vertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT) is a leader in data center equipment, with significant share in both power and cooling applications. The stock rebounded off recent weakness, as investors gained confidence that a massive build out of AI data centers globally was on the horizon. Vertiv’s strong relationship with chip manufacturers and involvement in the necessary technology roadmap for solutions as the energy density of server racks increases were catalysts. Vertiv’s orders were up 57% year-over-year in the second quarter, backlog was $7 billion, a record, and 2024 operating profit margin and EPS guidance was raised.” Overall, VRT ranks 9th on our list of stocks that will benefit from AI. While we acknowledge the potential of VRT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than VRT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Why Vistra Corp. (VST) Will Be a Major Beneficiary of AI

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Stocks That Will Benefit From AI. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) stands against other stocks that will benefit from AI. Artificial intelligence has been the driving theme of the stock market over the past couple of years which have seen investors battle inflation and high interest rates. Ever since OpenAI publicly released ChatGPT in November 2022 and NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang predicted the next year that there was a trillion-dollar market in play when it came to upgrading traditional computing hardware to accelerated computing, the stock market has seen no respite. However, when it comes to AI stocks, not all of them have flourished. Apart from Huang's firm, the world's leading graphics processing unit (GPU) designer, shares of OpenAI's biggest backer, i.e., the firm known for the Windows operating system, were two of the biggest initial AI beneficiaries. Between December 2022 and H1 2024, their shares have gained 631% and 75%, respectively. Other technology stocks have also ridden the AI wave and have posted gains ranging between 42% to 308%. Within these, the stock that has gained 308% is Facebook's parent entity and its focus on GPU investments and success with the Llama open source model have caught investor attention. These firms have primarily posted gains because the AI wave, as analysts would like to remind you, is in its early stages. This stage is characterized by investor interest in firms that are AI enablers. However, the next stage of AI investment could see investors broaden their horizons. Some of this diversification away from technology stocks has already taken place in the form of impressive performance by utility stocks in 2024. Their performance is evident through the utility component of the flagship S&P index gaining 28% from the start of the year to the end of November as it led the benchmark index by a percentage point. We analyzed this stage in AI investment in great detail as part of our coverage of Goldman Sachs’ Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks. Stocks in this list range from utility firms to computer hardware providers, semiconductor firms, and glass companies. Within this list, data center hardware firms were quite common, and as you read below, you'll find out why they might be the biggest beneficiaries of the next wave in AI investment. Wells Fargo has extensively covered the topic of what other stocks apart from the most valuable in the world can benefit from artificial intelligence. Its research covers firms that benefit from AI spending and applications. Starting from stocks that might benefit from AI spending, the bank notes that these will primarily include areas where the money trickles from AI data spending. In 2025, it estimates that hyperscaler cloud providers' capital expenditures can sit around a cool $180 billion. This is more than twice the expected spending by oil majors, which is estimated to sit at close to $85 billion. So where will this money trickle down to? Well, WF believes that while the "largest portion of cost involved in constructing data centers is graphics processing units (GPUs) and the supercomputers that contain them," other sectors that should not be ignored include "cabling; steel racks; cooling (liquid and air); electrical equipment (both inside and outside the box); and backup generators" along with others that "are required to lay the foundation and power generation to support the facility." While it lists down the usual culprits of information technology, communications services, and software firms that are part of discretionary stocks as the beneficiaries of data center spending, WF also adds two other sectors. These are industrial and material stocks, as the bank believes that while a "data center may not be a factory, but if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it might be a duck." It quotes research to share that since as much as 45% of the cost of building a data center "is related to land, building shell, and basic building fit-out," firms that "supply steel, aggregates, cement, and water equipment and, by extension, construction and engineering firms as well as broad non-residential construction suppliers (such as industrial distributors)" can benefit from the $180 billion in estimated hyperscaler capital expenditure. WF adds that data center spending will also include electrical and HVAC systems, as it notes that this sector can benefit from the fact that "there are a relatively limited number of scaled suppliers of large electrical equipment, commercial HVAC systems, and diesel generators."

Solar panel workers installing a new farm for clean energy generation. To make our list of stocks that will benefit from AI, we ranked the stocks part of our list of Goldman Sachs’ Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024. This upgrades the list since it was published when the latest hedge fund data was unavailable and it narrows down the list of stocks to the top fund favorites. Why are we interested in stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 97 Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) is one of the top-performing stocks of 2024 as its shares are up by a whopping 305% year-to-date. It is a Texas-based utility, and as you might have guessed, the firm has wide exposure to the nuclear industry. Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) also benefits from being an unregulated utility which enables it to self-set rate of returns on its power generation projects. The stock has risen in 2024 after the firm's decision to bring a nuclear business fully under its fold sent the shares soaring by 25%. Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) also scored another win this year when regulators approved its request to extend the operational life of a nuclear power plant. For full-year 2024, the firm aims to earn between $5 billion to $5.2 in operating income and $2.65 billion to $2.85 billion in free cash flow. Along with deals with data center firms for clean energy and the regulatory environment for future projects, these also play an important role in Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST)'s story. Meridian Funds mentioned Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: "Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) is an integrated retail electricity and power generation company, primarily serving Texas and the Midwest. We own Vistra because we expect power markets to continue tightening as baseload supply declines, coupled with rising demand from data centers, electric vehicles, and manufacturing reshoring. These factors create a favorable pricing environment for Vistra’s generation fleet, especially its nuclear and gas assets. The stock performed well during the period for three key reasons: tightening energy markets and strengthened pricing in forward-year energy contracts, the continuation of Vistra’s aggressive share repurchase program, and the company’s announced plan to acquire the remaining interest in Vistra Vision at an attractive valuation. Additionally, the company reaffirmed its 2024 guidance, indicating that results are trending toward the upper end of the previously projected range. We took advantage of the stock’s strength this quarter to trim our position.” Overall, VST ranks 7th on our list of stocks that will benefit from AI. While we acknowledge the potential of VST as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than VST but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Why BlackRock is turning even more bullish on US stocks for next year
URL: https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-outlook-blackrock-bullish-2025-ai-mega-forces-valuations-2024-12
Time Published: 2024-12-04T20:00:42Z
Full Content:
The world's largest asset manager says it's not too late to turn bullish on US stocks heading into 2025. In its outlook for the new year, BlackRock upgraded its "Overweight" rating on US stocks, turning even more bullish than its prior recommendation even as the S&P 500 trades at all-time highs. The firm was previously "+1" overweight relative to "Neutral" and is now "+2" overweight, with its highest overweight rating being "+3." BlackRock's recommendation to stay "pro-risk" toward US stocks is the opposite of Bank of America strategist Michael Hartnett, who recommended this week that investors should bet on international stocks in 2025 due to the fear that America's exceptionalism trade is about to end. But BlackRock isn't buying it. "U.S. equities have persistently outpaced their global peers," BlackRock's Investment Institute wrote in their 2025 outlook. "We think that could continue." The driving force behind BlackRock's doubling down on the US stock market rally to continue is the belief that "mega forces" like artificial intelligence are disproportionately set to benefit American companies. "We think the AI mega force will benefit U.S. stocks more and that's why we stay overweight, particularly relative to international peers such as European stocks," BlackRock said. The firm also believes potential tax cuts and an easing regulatory environment under the incoming Donald Trump administration should support continued economic growth. One top concern for US stock market investors has been valuations, which, based on metrics like price-to-earnings ratios, are hitting historical extremes. However, BlackRock dismissed the valuation concern by highlighting that the US economy looks a lot different than it did in the past, as technology and services take center stage at the expense of manufacturing. "The equity market's changing sectoral composition reflects the transformation taking hold. So, comparing today's index to that of the past is like comparing apples to oranges," BlackRock said. Valuation measures have also proven to be a poor timing tool for getting in or out of the stock market, the firm said. "We are risk-on for now but stay nimble." The firm said factors that could force it to change its bullish tune include a significant surge in long-term bond yields or an escalation in trade protectionism.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 13 Best Farmland and Agriculture Stocks To Invest In According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE:NTR) stands against the other farmland and agriculture stocks. The farmland and agriculture sector is crucial for global food security and economic stability. As the world population continues to grow, the demand for food increases, necessitating innovative practices in agriculture and farming. Recent trends indicate a significant shift towards technology-driven agriculture, which aims to enhance productivity while promoting sustainability. In the first quarter of 2024, McKinsey surveyed around 4,400 farmers across Europe, India, Latin America, and North America to understand the factors influencing their profitability and technology adoption. The firm conducted a similar survey in 2022. The findings indicate that while farmers are increasingly adopting technology, the pace remains slow, with a three-percentage-point rise since 2022 in those using or willing to use at least one new digital tool to improve operations. READ ALSO: 8 Best Fertilizer Stocks To Buy Now and 10 Stocks with Consistent Growth to Buy. North American farmers lead in technology adoption. In the US, 61% of farmers are using or willing to adopt digital agronomy. Additionally, 51% are using or willing to adopt precision agriculture hardware, and 38% are adopting remote-sensing technologies. Latin America showed the most significant growth in technology adoption, with a remarkable ten-percentage-point increase from 2022 to 2024. Farmers around the world are more inclined to adopt new technologies that directly improve operations. According to the data, digital agronomy and precision agriculture hardware are the most popular technologies around the world. The survey highlights that in the US, larger farms are 45% more likely to adopt agricultural technology compared to smaller farms. This trend can be attributed to the greater scale needed for a favorable return on investment (ROI) in agtech. Despite the challenges posed by rising input costs and extreme weather conditions, farmers are looking towards sustainable practices and innovative technologies to enhance their productivity and profitability. Organizations that provide technology and services have a unique opportunity to cater to farmers’ diverse needs across different regions. To compile our list of the 13 best farmland and agriculture stocks to invest in according to hedge funds, we used the Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to find the largest farmland and agriculture companies. We also reviewed our own rankings and consulted various online resources. From an initial pool of more than 30 farmland and agriculture stocks, we focused on the top 13 stocks most favored by institutional investors. Data for the hedge fund sentiment surrounding each stock was taken from Insider Monkey’s Q3 2024 database of 900 elite hedge funds. The 13 best farmland and agriculture stocks to invest in are ranked in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them, as of Q3 2024. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

The company has made good progress and now aims to achieve $200 million in operational efficiencies by 2025, one year ahead of schedule. These efficiencies will be realized through cost reductions across both retail and corporate operations. In the first nine months of 2024, Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE:NTR) reported an adjusted EBITDA of $4.3 billion, driven by higher retail earnings, increased fertilizer volumes, and lower operating costs. The company has already boosted sales volumes by 1.3 million tons this year through the first 3 quarters of 2024, with plans to increase potash and nitrogen production by an additional 2 to 3 million tons compared to 2023 levels. Nutrien Ltd.’s (NYSE:NTR) strong health is further demonstrated by its commitment to returning value to shareholders.

Title: Why Is Kura Oncology, Inc. (KURA) Among the Best Small-Cap Biotech Stocks With Massive Potential According to Hedge Funds?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Small-Cap Biotech Stocks with Massive Potential According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Kura Oncology, Inc. (NASDAQ:KURA) stands against the other small-cap biotech stocks. The biotechnology sector is expanding quickly due to rising demand for novel therapies, technological advances, and government assistance. Advances in fields like gene editing, sequencing, personalized medicine, and artificial intelligence are making new techniques possible, while the aging population and growing healthcare demands are driving a robust market for new treatments. According to a report by McKinsey & Company, venture capital firms made approximately $52 billion in global investments in therapeutic-focused biotech companies between 2019 and 2021. Two-thirds of this sum was given to platform-tech start-up companies. Despite its growth, many biotech companies have faced challenges in turbulent markets, taking drastic measures such as cutting programs and implementing significant layoffs to conserve cash. While recent rate cuts could encourage the revival of scientific projects, analysts like Jared Holz note the difficulty of gauging their impact. Holz also highlighted a shift in market dynamics, observing that biotech's performance increasingly correlates with small-cap equities. If small-cap stocks trade well, biotech is likely to follow, though stagnation could occur if momentum fades. Notably, the idea of interest rates predicting biotech success is relatively new, emerging only after the pandemic, which reshaped the industry by driving substantial investment into therapeutic-focused companies. With innovative treatments, biotech businesses are revolutionizing healthcare by tackling important unmet medical needs. Establishing the National Bioeconomy Board as a component of Biden's Investing in America agenda is a significant breakthrough. It seeks to maximize biotechnology's economic potential in the United States. Furthermore, policy suggestions to expedite the approval process for biotechnology goods are being developed by the National Security Commission on Emerging Biotechnology. More academics will be able to use biotechnology for agricultural purposes if entry obstacles are reduced, which will benefit American farmers and increase food security. It is anticipated that these initiatives will open up new markets. This year (2024) started strongly for the biotechnology sector due to a rise in mergers and acquisitions as well as anticipations of falling interest rates. Therefore, estimates suggest that the worldwide biotechnology market might increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 14% from 2024 to 2033, reaching an astonishing $5.7 trillion. The market for agricultural biotechnology is also expected to develop at a 7.9% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) and reach $232 billion by 2032. But even with the market's potential, investing in biotech companies still carries a number of serious dangers. Bankruptcy may result from failing to satisfy clinical trial endpoints or obtain adequate finance before a product launch. In the biotech industry, where drug development usually takes more than ten years and has an estimated failure rate of about 90%, the danger of failure is very substantial. Hence, biotech stocks are often considered “high-risk, high-reward” investments due to their upside potential coupled with significant risks In our methodology, we identified the top small-cap biotech stocks with significant growth potential, ranked according to their total hedge fund holdings as of Q2 2024. Our selection process began by filtering companies with a small market capitalization. Next, we reviewed analyst recommendations, focusing on stocks with strong bullish sentiment and high institutional ownership. Finally, we ranked these companies based on the number of hedge funds holding their shares as of Q2 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A biopharmaceutical researcher intently studying results from a clinical trial. Number of Hedge Fund Holdings: 36 Kura Oncology, Inc. (NASDAQ:KURA) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing precision medicines for the treatment of cancer. At its core, the company designs and develops targeted therapies that aim to improve outcomes for patients with various types of solid tumors and blood cancers. A major catalyst for Kura Oncology, Inc. (NASDAQ:KURA) is the development of ziftomenib, its lead drug candidate. Ziftomenib, an oral medication targeting the menin-MLL1 protein-protein interaction, has received a Breakthrough Therapy Designation for patients with relapsed/refractory NPM1-mutant acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This designation could accelerate the drug's path to market, potentially leading to increased revenue and market share. Another catalyst is the company's expanding clinical trial program. The corporation has completed enrollment in a Phase 2 registration-directed trial of ziftomenib (KOMET-001) and is conducting multiple clinical trials to evaluate ziftomenib in combination with current standard-of-care regimens. Kura Oncology, Inc. (NASDAQ:KURA) reported significant financial developments in Q3 2024, with research and development expenses increasing to $41.7 million from $29.3 million in Q3 2023 which was driven by higher clinical trial costs for key programs such as ziftomenib and KO-2806. General and administrative expenses also rose to $18.2 million from $13.1 million, contributing to a net loss of $54.4 million, up from $38.6 million in the prior year. The company maintains a strong cash position of $455.3 million, ensuring operational funding into 2027.
