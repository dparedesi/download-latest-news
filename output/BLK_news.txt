Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Officials in Beijing and Hong Kong spoke out Tuesday against a proposal to sell ports in the Panama Canal to a consortium led by BlackRock, sending shares in the Hong Kong-based conglomerate that owns the ports plummeting. It’s unclear how regulators could interfere with the plan, which was announced earlier this month, given that the ports that CK Hutchison intends to offload to the group led by the US investment giant are located outside of mainland China and Hong Kong. However, observers have said Beijing’s sharp criticism of the deal means it may not ultimately go through. When asked at a regular press conference whether China was investigating CK Hutchison’s planned sale, Mao Ning, a spokesperson for the foreign ministry, declined to answer directly. But she made Beijing’s view clear. “I would like to emphasize that China has always firmly opposed the use of economic coercion, hegemonism and bullying to infringe upon the legitimate rights and interests of other countries,” she said. Her comments echoed those of John Lee, Hong Kong’s leader, who earlier on Tuesday said: “We oppose the abusive use of coercion or bullying tactics in international, economic and trade relations.” On Tuesday, Bloomberg reported that several Chinese government agencies, including the top market regulator, had been instructed by state leaders to study the deal for any potential security breaches or antitrust violations. CNN has reached out to CK Hutchison for comment. Its shares fell as much as 5% Tuesday due to jitters about the future of the proposal, which is currently an “agreement in principle.” Earlier this month, the group of investors led by BlackRock said it would spend $22.8 billion to buy the ports of Balboa and Cristobal on either end of the Panama Canal from CK Hutchison, as well as its controlling interest in 43 other ports comprising 199 berths in 23 countries. Hong Kong is a former British colony that was returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a special arrangement with Beijing, which granted the city autonomy and wide-ranging freedoms unavailable in mainland China. But a national security law that came into effect in 2020 has transformed Hong Kong’s political, legal and business landscape. CNN’s Fred He and Chris Lau contributed reporting.

Over my pay grade but…..Erdogan has been all hat, no cattle in terms of brave words in support of the Palestinians not matched by action. He supported HTS in Syria mainly to teach Assad a lesson and to get him to Do Something about Syrian refugees in Turkiye, as in take a lot back. The plan, or at least his plan, was not to topple Assad. This action would be a massive double-crossing of Erdogan by Israel, since Turkiye has stood pat as Israel has chewed up Syria. An expulsion into Syria would lead to a new refugee influx into the much less bad off Turkiye. But Turkiye has been too chicken-shit to cross the US.

Aljazeera is repeated a lie by Marco Rubio, that the US “coordinated with Russia” on the Yemeni attacks. This sort of thing at the margin is not helpful to the US improving relations with Russia, let alone getting to any sort of big deal. From the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the call: During the conversation, Marco Rubio informed him of the US decision to launch a military operation against the Houthi forces in the Red Sea region. Sergey Lavrov, in response to the arguments by the American representative, stressed the need for all parties to immediate cease the use of force and the importance for all sides to engage in political dialogue so as to find a solution that would prevent further bloodshed. Note much of the press is not clearly reporting that the Houthis had stopped attacks while the ceasefire was on and merely said they’d resume them if the ceasefire failed and food was not let in, ie, the Trump strikes were pre-emptive.

Alex Christoforou pointed out in his latest video that this power plant is actually in Zaporizhzhia Oblast which voted and did join the Russian Federation. The Russian Constitution will not allow Putin to sell it off or give it away to Trump as it is Russian territory. I could see Putin offering to sell electricity generated there to the Ukraine as much as their electrical grid is ash right now however. So either Trump is just spouting his latest bs lines or he thinks constitutions are just like contracts – always up for renegotiation – and expects Putin to get in line. High hopes. Trump will give Russia Crimea because Tennyson! \sarc\ Trump will get back Donbass, while giving them the last Kursk “pocket”. \sarc\ Russia will offer to negotiate the shape of the table in Paris starting next December. \sarc\ Ukraine has nearly gone through all 500 gifted ATACMS; got no advantage from them and wants 500 more to get no advantage. Russia has a great career keeping this debacle ruining the US. While Trump and Bibi pound sand and kill children from Sana’a to Gaza. BTW observed somewhere USAF defeated most of the Houthi drones shot toward USS Truman. Go Navy! Under USAF fighter cover.

Israel attacked Gaza, killing hundreds: https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/gaza-israel-hamas-strikes-03-18-25/index.html Never forget how they lied for months and months. By the way, I suspect this is the template for the Russia-Ukraine war – they’ll lie about a ceasefire being “on the 10 yard line” for about a year, then when it finally happens, it will implode after fewer than 60 days. The lying liars just love to lie, lie, lie! They are non-agreement capable, the whole rotten lot: Blinken, Biden, Trump, Witkoff, Rubio When an Israeli spokesman appears on TV these days, I just switch myself off. Nearly everything that they say is a lie so what is the point of listening to what they have to say? Their word means nothing. Please apply the same filter to Trump and Witkoff. They are nothing but liars. Rapid Onset Political Enlightenment Tablet. A must read. …the newly minted digital variant of “public opinion” was rooted in the algorithms that determine how fads spread on social media, in which mass multiplied by speed equals momentum—speed being the key variable. The result was a fast-moving mirror world that necessarily privileges the opinions and beliefs of the self-appointed vanguard who control the machinery, and could therefore generate the velocity required to change the appearance of “what people believe” overnight… Every form of totalitarianism is unique….Soviet cynicism was a natural product of how the Soviets decided to rule, which was to demand absolute external compliance to party dictates in word and deed while at the same time allowing its subjects a separate space to think their own thoughts—provided that they never acted on those thoughts. The natural outcome of the Soviet system was compliance without belief… Musk, meanwhile, was entirely and sincerely his own man—a privilege that came in part from being the richest man in America, and in part from the nature of his businesses, which the Obama cadres appear to have misunderstood. Musk may have paid twice as much as the next-highest bidder for Twitter, if such a bidder actually ever existed. Netanyahu’s decision to invade Rafah on May 6, 2024, was the culmination of two long and otherwise separate chains of events whose consequences will continue to reverberate throughout the Middle East, and also at home. Netanyahu had been promising to invade Rafah since February. The fact that he had not done so by May had become both a symbol of Israeli weakness and indecision in the face of a global onslaught of Jew-hatred, as well as the continuing solidity of the regional power structure established by Obama’s Iran deal. Too much to unpack without a re-reading and careful deconstruction. But, some items stand out. True enough there is a “new machinery” in place from when the days of Lipmann, and that each “form of totalitarianisms is unique,” but to say that “Musk is his own man” I think is false, just ask Bibi and those who control his military contracts, which may be the same group. As for “global onslaught of Jew-hatred,” it’s very wide, too wide a paint brush that the author uses. The images I saw this morning of 300 dead Palestinians make me hate the state of Israel, Christians, atheist, Buddhist, Taoist, Maoist, gays, lesbians, straights or any other designation you wish to make including Jews, that supports this indiscriminate bombing of women and children. Too bad Samuels’ derangement on Iran derails an otherwise interesting examination of “the blob” and its use of 21st Century communications technology to “manufacture consent.” Going to grab a cup and read. I hope it mentions that he Soviets were also telling the people that computer programs were making the govt and businesses more efficient by figuring out what needed to be manufactured, etc ! I personally was struck by the language around the COVID lockdowns. Being a “bad” thing, that is, foisted upon us by Obama’s “permission structure machine” or suchlike. Without going into a long and detailed breakdown, because it is far, far too early in the morning, and because there are other subjects I would much, much rather write an essay on at the moment. My OVERALL reaction to the piece is that the author a) tries too much to pretend that the media and propaganda environment of the 2010s and early 2020s was COMPLETELY AND RADICALLY DIFFERENT from the past, and b) asserts, more or less out of thin air, that it is now done, finished, kaputski. I’ve done a lot of reading, and watching, of Cold War-era propaganda, for my own edification – because I feel that you cannot study the Cold War era as a whole without so doing. What may be different, to some extent, between today and, say, the 1950s, is the structure of the media landscape through which propaganda is applied, as well as the attendant terminology. But the basic idea of constructing a cage around one’s public actions and statements, of enforcing endless re-pledging of fealty – dare I say, of allegiance – through both positive and negative reinforcement, of flooding the voters’ brains with easy to remember slogans that catch on like fads and have no rational basis in reality? I mean, been there, done that, many times? And I won’t even touch the whole “where, oh where has objective journalism disappeared off to with Russiagate” thing with a ten foot pole. Instead, I recommend a book – “Selling the Korean War”, by Steven Casey, and another one, “Second Front – Censorship and Propaganda in the 1991 Gulf War”, by John Macarthur. Snapshots in time of exactly how that sort of “objective journalism” was managed by the Powers That Be long, long before Axelrod and Obama were doing their tango. Yes, Wisner’s “Mighty Wurlitzer” got a digital upgrade. And Obama was born into Wizner’s “family”. In some ways very insightful, this is a “limited hang out.” Despite its length Samuels’ Rapid Onset article is worth a read because it lays out useful bits of the expansion of propaganda techniques in national politics. Obama and Axelrod certainly deserve lots of criticism, but because he wants to focus his story on them he misses enormously important context. Samuels makes zero mention of propaganda techniques prior to Axelrod, so he can portray him as a huge innovator. No mention of the long war of corporate/libertarian interests against hugely popular New Deal policies. No mention of the massively funded Koch type programs to push neoliberal Democrats, mainstream media, academics and the judiciary to support policies that had little electoral support. Zero mention of longstanding propaganda techniques such has heightening tribalism by reducing everything to good-versus-evil narratives that demonizing opponents. Zero mention of how this fueled the PMC takeover of the Democratic Party and the PMC’s complete abandonment of broad New Deal-type coalitions. In this context Obama and Axelrod weren’t driving major changes but were continuing ongoing shifts. And were doing a lousy job on the propaganda front, because they weren’t tapping into or solidifying any portion of the Democratic base, and weren’t directing the base’s anger at political opponents. Samuels mentions some political failures (healthcare) and ignores others (abortion, immigration, gutting antitrust) but these don’t fit his larger thesis that Obama and Axelrod were masters at creating support for policies voters didn’t really like. Because Samuels ignores the longer, bipartisan history of manipulative propaganda, and ignores the PMC issues, he misses that Trump gains are largely explained by his ability (however cynical) to tap into the electorate’s more populist concerns, why the Dems aggressively expunge anyone not totally dedicated to the interests of large donors. Samuels assumes that (but does not explain why) an Israeli-Saudi total victory over Iran and the Palestinians would be a wonderful thing. This leads to the perverse conclusion that Obama’s Iran deal had nothing to do with stabilizing an ugly Middle East and reducing the chance of wars that US voters had absolutely no interest in. Instead, Samuels insists that the Iran deal was a cyncical Obama ploy to reduce the power of Jews within the Democratic Party. Yes Israel/Iran issues are very complicated, and there are a range of plausible arguments on all sides, but Samuels falls into the exact same tribal/good-versus evil propaganda framing he is attacking Axelrod for. Zero mention of the enormous power of AIPAC type money on the Democratic Party, and zero mention that the huge growth of political donations might have had a bigger impact on imposing unwanted policies on the electorate than any of Axelrod’s campaign techniques. Thank you for taking the time to write this! Great comment. Per my mighty wurlitzer comment above, there’s been in place somewhere in the bowels of the Blob since at least when Keenan wrote his “Political Warfare” memo a sophisticated propaganda machine organized along the principles of Norbert Wiener’s “cybernetics”. Increasingly and particularly since Reagan this machine has been targeted domestically and it has always existed primarily in the service of capitalist oligarchic interests. We’re now seeing various factions taking form amongst erstwhile capitalist oligarchs as the inertia of the State is degraded by DOGE and Lawfare. Zionism appears to be heavier in one faction, but there may suddenly be many factions rather than our habitual two. There is a unique data person in the news recently involved in identifying many of the linkages and impacts of federal budgets and programs, like USAID and campaign finance. She goes by the name DataRepublican (small r), and here is an interview with her. >Minnesota Republicans seek to codify ‘Trump derangement syndrome’ as mental illness It’s funnier than The Babylon Bee. Funny like “this meat smells funny”, or “we have a funny kind of democracy”. I guess if one is critical of Trump one can be committed to the “funny farm”. Good times. I suppose that there are two types of “funny.” There is funny funny and there is funny strange. Two different meanings. It’s all about context. I believe the saying goes “as in funny ha-ha or funny strange” I’ve heard both. The British version is funny ha-ha or funny peculiar, which is more sinister, more… Lovecraftian. “It’s a funny old world.” Yes. Not that I was a fan of “Thatcherism”, but it sure looks manageable from today’s perspective. I don’t know. One of my friends has a bad case of TDS. Throughout Biden’s term the guy was always mocking election deniers. When we were hanging out this weekend, he was telling me all about how Trump rigged the 2024 election. When I pointed out that I was not interested in his election denialism, a position he formerly mocked, he replied that this was different because there was evidence. I asked him about his “evidence.” Needless to say, it was a screed about how Elon has hackers and Trump said we “would never have to vote again” but drawn out into a five minute rant. I’m finding it less funny by the day. Funny how?! MAGA folks or liberals? They each have their own type. OpenAI Says It’s “Over” If It Can’t Steal All Your Copyrighted Work – Futurism Fair use isn’t claiming the work and thoughts of others is some computer program “thinking”. These f’ers from A to Z (Altman to Zelensky) are out of ideas except asset-stripoing and looting. I refused Cambridge University Press permission to turn over my textbook to the AI things. They COULD very logically and easily conclude that the open access stuff by me is worth scraping instead. It would be a pity if I copied over all the main orthogonal main effects plans and balanced incomplete block designs to my public website with any “minor unintentional copy-paste mistakes” and these got scraped and thus shone like the beacons of Gondor in studies that used those ;-) I don’t find the framing of this very convincing. If training materials for AI are regarded as not being covered under fair use, the biggest beneficiaries would be publishers like Elsevier and Penguin as well as major IP holders like Disney. Artists and authors would benefit negligibly, if at all, regardless of whether the copyright for their works is held or managed by a corporation. At best, I could see a “Spotify model” being implemented, but, for the vast majority of artists, the earnings from streaming services are a pittance (for them), and it’s hard to imagine artists not associated with publishers benefiting much. More likely, many will still end up included in the training datasets while being given legal tools they can’t feasibly use.

Artists and authors would benefit negligibly, if at all, regardless of whether the copyright for their works is held or managed by a corporation. Yes and that’s the unfortunate price a lot of us paid to get our books published. Is it fair? No. I get on average GBP80 p.a. royalties for my textbook, all of which goes to my accountant since I am required to do a self-assessment for tax, for which my accountant charges around GBP80. But I never did this for the money. Flaw number one in your reasoning. At best, I could see a “Spotify model” being implemented, but, for the vast majority of artists, the earnings from streaming services are a pittance (for them), and it’s hard to imagine artists not associated with publishers benefiting much. Again, I didn’t do it for the money. I always knew I’d gain only a pittance. Let me give you some insights (which I’ve stated here before) as to the purpose of my textbook, which gives flaw number two. I, along with the two most esteemed academics in my field at the time (RIP both now) wrote this book not in the expectation that it’d become the “default textbook” in ANY course in ANY country in the world. Why would it not? Because it is absolutely antithetical to big companies who offer consultancy services in discrete choice modelling. If you’re an academic who wants the dosh, you’re probably going to want to stay sweet with such companies. Thus, do NOT recommend to students a book which “opens the black box” and tells them how to do all this stuff themselves. More likely, many will still end up included in the training datasets while being given legal tools they can’t feasibly use. See my point below. The whole point about discrete choice modelling is that you NEED statistical design matrices, which don’t stay up on the internet for long (for various reasons, but NOT for any copyright/legal infringements etc). If AI want to scrape my stuff they’re welcome. The stuff “owned” by CUP might not be scraped, and even if so, AI will struggle. Why? Because what I and colleagues did was NOT stuff on what economists call the “production possibilities frontier”. By definition it was work to move beyond this using well designed experiments that are NOT out there to “scrape”. As a final note, our book merely gives the reader all the statistical and survey method tools to do the types of discrete choice models we pioneered. I spent 5 years working hard in peace from funders before I got my “key paper” published. Then on EVERY single project since I have been employed I have tried to be humble in recognising that I have an equation with two unknowns and therefore potentially infinite solutions. The only way to hone in the likely correct one is to spend a LOT of time among a multi-disciplinary group including experts who “work at the coal face” to get an idea as to which is the REAL maximum in the maximum likelihood function. AI can’t give you that in any area beyond an incredibly narrow number of applications for which we already know the answer. I do not fear AI. Because what I did was based on 20 years’ of experience “thinking outside the box”. Furthermore I never did it for the cash, I did it (stupid and naive those this makes me sound) to enable followers to know the general “path” towards a solution. To GET a solution, they still must do a lot of HUMAN work. Since I’m the last remaining expert in my my field, with h-indices, and an Erdős number better than any health economist I’ve ever known (who didn’t get it purely by being someone I taught), I’m fairly sure my work will get scraped. This won’t help people, however and I’m relaxed. As a final note, if you want proof as to the shenanigans that go on in “academics versus business”, look up the edit history on wikipedia of the maxdiff model. When it stopped being an advert for a company and instead started being the definition of a long-standard mathematical model, that’s when I, under tutelage of one of my colleagues, began to put things right. Our “back and forth” with certain people ended when we got our book published and a certain wiki sub-editor who knew their stuff put a stop to editing by certain people for a while. “Because what I did was based on 20 years’ of experience “thinking outside the box”. The LLMs have provided a literal meaning to “thinking outside the box”. Yeah, trouble is what it actually is, is “making shit up” when they must think outside the box. One of my oldest undergrad friends works in AI at Google. He refuses to say exactly what he does. But he did quiz me a LOT 5-10 years ago about what I was doing in my research. I think (personally) he got the “idea” of what I did (moving beyond the PPF) but never really understood what AI needed to do to “really” think outside the box. Which has made me think AI is actually nowhere near genuine proper artificial intelligence. The “Google et al AI” is not thinking outside the box in the way a human would do AT ALL. It is still rooted in predictive algorithms. Its version of “intuition” is “just making shit up”. “Thinking outside the box” only has true meaning for humans. It really has no meaning for computer programs. yep! Schrödinger’s AI coming soon? :) I’m also thinking the copyrights of others would be collateral for debt. This is not snark……I’m genuinely wondering…….maybe I’m being dumb but could you expand upon your point (without making a load of work for you!)? I don’t get your point :( I’m taking a leap of thought into a future where there are copyrights claimed that are not theirs. Right now they’ve managed to limit copyright filing to people. For now. ah thanks. I wonder what kinda “power levels” there are. Cambridge University (as a Federal institution) is a lot more powerful than it was in my day in the 1990s thanks to “Gates Business Park” etc. However, the Colleges own HUGE swathes of land, e,g, the entire port of Folkestone….. Wonder what a battle of the “land barons” vs the “new AI tech companies” would play out? I objected to the Cambridge IP land grab, when they stripped academics of absolute ownership of their patentable inventions (IIRC, they did not dispossess them of copyright because they needed the useful idiot arts faculty to vote for the patent changes) The late Ross Anderson at the Comp.Sci.Department and I worked up my idea to organise all academics to donate their IP to a company which would licence it back to them provided the Uni was not a co-owner or a sublicensee etc. It was going to be called “Non Placet Limited”, it does not please (what is said to vote against against a motion in the Senate)…. Good for you! A pity it didn’t work. As AI nurses reshape hospital care, human nurses are pushing back – Associated Press “The group raised new alarms in January when Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the incoming health secretary, suggested AI nurses “as good as any doctor” could help deliver care in rural areas.” I want to see all the Kennedys and their ilk using AI nurses and doctors – without questioning the BS. Let it be tested on them. They eant it so badly. Be the guinea pig. I’m sure that before you used one of those AI nurses, that they would make you sign a waiver absolving them of any resulting bad incident up to and including death. And if you refused, then you can’t see that AI nurse. Can’t see a real doctor or nurse either though as that AI nurse replaced them and they no longer work their. Real doctors and nurses are for those who can afford them. Sounds about right “Up to 90% of arms, munitions destroyed in Kursk Region belong to NATO — Russian diplomat” To be expected. For months now Zelensky has thrown his best formations into Kursk to try to get a breakthrough but they have all been stopped cold. In addition, Zelensky was sending the last of his best equipment to Kursk as well up to and including Abram tanks. As this pocket started to shrink, I would have expected NATO to pump in any and all weaponry that they could scrounge to try to stop Kursk from collapsing altogether. Now that it is mostly over, I am not surprised to see huge stocks of NATO weaponry being picked up by the Russians. Makes you wonder though. Like with Afghanistan, will Trump demand that Russia hand back all that NATO weaponry or face sanctions? But I think that his teeth will grind when he sees all those tanks and weapons – especially American ones – on display in military museums in Moscow. I’m curious how much of that weaponry can be re-furbished and re-purposed by Russia for the battlefield. It would be hilarious to see an Abrams tank with a Russian flag rolling into Kharkov. Or an Aussie Bushmaster vehicle with the SMO markings used to storm Kherson. Kiev will sell parts and ammunition. Finding spare parts is a problem the western stuff breaks so often. The black market will work. Would be more hilarious to copy what the UK/EU countries do and take a tank or vehicle from one of those countries that was donated to the Ukraine & captured and park it outside their Embassy in Moscow. After all, turnaround is fair play. Some of them will be sent to Iran. Since the Iranians are masters of reverse engineering, they may be able to create new weapons for the Palestinian resistance. >>>Ultra-processed babies: are toddler snacks one of the great food scandals of our time? of course. I don’t need the Guardian to tell me that. Reminds me of my, ostensibly “health-conscious,” cousin. She spends a fortune at Whole Foods….only to stock her pantry w/the Whole Foods-brand, organic versions of shelf-stable snacks, and plastic sippy pouches (high salt, high sugar, high industrial seed oils, low satiety). Of course, I’m never going to give her the “errr, aware you aware that….” lecture, lol. I’ve always wondered if those plastic applesauce-yogurt sippy-pouches are one of many sources of BPA, etc. I suppose you could make raw snacks out of babies, but public acceptance is probably improved by ultra-processing. Terrific antidotes today, thank you. Of course fox loves music! I have a PhD student who gives guitar concerts to moose at night in the field. They are quite appreciative and curious. Orpheus was real;^) moose – guitar fox – banjo elephant – piano cow – trombone David Samuels, Rapid Onset. Tablet. Important for its attempt to bury Obama rather than to praise him. This observation alone is worth the time you spend on the long essay: ‘The Obama Democratic Party (ODP) was a kind of balancing mechanism between the power and money of the Silicon Valley oligarchs and their New York bankers; the interests of bureaucratic and professional elites who shuttled between the banks and tech companies and the work of bureaucratic oversight; the ODP’s own sectarian constituencies, which were divided into racial and ethnic categories like “POC,” “MENA,” and “Latinx,” whose bizarre bureaucratic nomenclature signaled their inherent existence as top-down containers for the party’s new-age spoils system; and the world of billionaire-funded NGOs that provided foot-soldiers and enforcers for the party’s efforts at social transformation.’ Also important for Samuels’s own hobbyhorses and his failure to break new ground. To wit: –Obama did all of this more or less on his own, somehow? I don’t believe in the Great Man excuse for history. –Obama is a product of the Democratic Party, rather than leading an incursion from outside. So the Clintons are involved in here somewhere, eh? –The author seems to be much too convinced that his rubric is “airtight.” Yet the current war (and genocide) in Ukraine is a proxy war based on Western lies and very much on the unwillingness of the Russians to publicize much. The West is spilling secret information constantly, announcing its addled plans, and screaming its soon-to-be-made mistakes. The Russians don’t say much. The Russian concession to the digital world is to send out the wildly intelligent and witty Maria Zakharova – but she was invented by Jay Ward way back when as Natasha Fatal –The author slips on the “genocide in Gaza,” which he offers as a meme. What happened here is very interesting: The Palestinians were finally able to get the world to see them on social media. The exception that tests the rule? Or is Samuels’s too-clean structure a hollow figure made from pipe cleaners? See below in which Netanyahu becomes a savior. Oh. –David Axelrod as evil genius? –Elon Musk as one of three saviors? “Musk, meanwhile, was entirely and sincerely his own man—a privilege that came in part from being the richest man in America, and in part from the nature of his businesses, which the Obama cadres appear to have misunderstood.” –And then the Holy Book of Netanyahu. Sheesh. –Obama may deserve revenge. This essay isn’t it. –And I’m Saint Joseph, the father of god (feastday tomorrow: Send adoration.) Yeah, it might have been a tad more palatable if the writer had used Obama Administration as the subject throughout the story instead of just Obama. Like Trump Administration should be used instead of Trump. Yup, he lost me once his priors on Covid, Musk, Israel and Iran took over what had been a ln interesting article with some valid observations. Still worth the read, but with critical thinking and a spoonful of informed skepticism. I thought this essay was brilliant, right up until this gem: “the idea that Iran was itself a formidable adversary—was a mess of lies. Iran was not and never was a regional power, capable of “balancing” traditional American allies. It was a totalitarian shit hole regime that is deeply hated by its own people and throughout the region, entirely dependent on American backing in its efforts to gain a nuclear bomb.” Frankly, the essay up to that point *is* briliant and it has given me a new way to think about Obama, about Musk/Twitter and about David Samuels…. I overlooked the Covid points because he isn’t necessarily wrong in writing about how the digital false consciousness manufactured “consent” to unreasonable measures (the relatives of the dying could have been FFP3 masked and allowed to visit and enforced to quarantine at properly ventilated and invigilated facilities rather than leave their loved ones to die alone…). Also… autistic traits and possibly ADHD are a superpower. You cannot manufacture consent with people who don’t give a shit about other’s feelings but really have to know THE FACTS. Could non-autistic Elon – say, Tim Cook or Larry Ellison – have bought twitter? This article is the high-blown answer to Armchair Warlord’s simple question: why is the twiiterverse of commentary on Ukraine from people with anime pictures in their bio’s (and no Ukraine flags) so much more right on all the big questions than MSM and the entire pllkitucsl class. Because they are immune at least in part to external voices, either because they hear only their own (autism) or they hear loads of others (ADHF, not stable internal monologue but a cacophany). The video of Katherine Franke (“police state watch”) explaining the extortion technique Trump uses when “negotiating” is a must watch. “Introduction of brownshirts” is now officially on my bingo card. I’m with you on the “Brownshirts” issue. It is the next logical step. We must also remember that the Brownshirts were part of a larger ecology of violent militias at the time. Who today remembers that the Communists also fought “in the streets” back then? It is also instructive to remember that most of the brawlers doing the fighting in the streets then were ex-military veterans of the Great War. All that is needed to make the analogy complete is for America to lose a decently sized war. “Beware the Ides of March — Are Trump and Netanyahu, Acting in Tandem, Committing Political Suicide?” It’s amazing in its own way. Trump has this huge agenda in how he wants to reshape America into his idea of what America should look like. Probably something like 1890s America – but without all that industry. Now after only two months, he is ready to jump into the Ukrainian rasputitsa at the instigation of the UK and France instead of just walking away. This could very easily now become Trump’s war. And if that wasn’t enough, it looks like at the instigation of Israel that he wants to get involved in a shooting war in the Middle east. For now it it is Yemen but he is already threatening Iran. That aborted attack on Iran last year should have shown him that that may not be so easily done. Trump probably think that in any room, that he is the smartest one there but that ain’t necessarily so. That would have to be a pretty small room, or one with only a handful of people in it. Trump Administration. The reality TV star isn’t thinking of all of this himself. – ‘The European Parliament Confirmed Poland’s Centrality To The Bloc’s Eastern Security Strategy’ – Andrew Korybko There are many important issues embedded in this article, as well as the others by Korybko that he cites in the text. I note two here. First, his “New Iron Curtain” terminology emphasizes a key point that isn’t discussed often enough in the face of Russia’s impending “defeat” of Ukraine. This is that the NUMBER ONE priority of this long-planned proxy war was to *sever the ties between Russia and Europe* that had been developing since the end of the Soviet Union. Atlanticist-oriented neocons have been writing about this since the 1990s. Their fear was not just the re-emergence of a Russia that might challenge US military supremacy someday, but the economic challenge of a Europe – especially Germany – reintegrated with Russia. The Nordstream pipeline was the ultimate symbol of this danger. Far from a “defeat” for the US/NATO alliance, in terms of severing these ties and building a “new Iron Curtain,” the Ukraine war has been an unqualified success. Mission accomplished! So much for “keeping Russia out and Germany down.” How about the “keeping America in” part? This is another area in which a lot of people seem to be celebrating a bit prematurely (with Yves and a few others being significant exceptions). Many commentators, even those critical of the US/NATO project like Korybko, simply assume that Trumpian “populism” has won in the US and we are getting out of Europe, leaving our poor European “allies” high and dry. Now they’ll have to defend themselves, while the US withdraws, perhaps to concentrate on warmongering with China or finishing our destruction of the Middle East. But there is a very powerful and bipartisan Atlanticist Establishment in the US. There are some factional disagreements, but they all — neoliberals; neoconservatives; the huge arms industry, its lobbyists, and Congressional lackeys: the national security apparatus: the Europhile liberal media/academia complex – all of them, have a massive material and/or ideological investment in the Atlanticist project. They’ve managed to capture (almost) all of the European political class. They spent 8 years carrying out war against Trump for this reason. Do people really think they are going to give up now? Are the “populists” now in control? Really? Lots of other issues suggested in this piece (e.g. the centrality of Poland in the New Cold War). But these two are the most striking to me. European Russophobia and Atlanticism are two sides of the same coin. Like Janus. And all those in the Trump Administration talking about the “stock market doesn’t matter’…. What are their short and put positions? “Vote crow next general election.” Never. Rook voter for life. Crow is fur eatin’, not votin’. https://fortune.com/2025/03/14/elon-musk-tesla-cybertruck-delivery-halt-owners-complain-of-metal-sides-falling-off/ Elon Musk’s Tesla reportedly halts Cybertruck deliveries as owners complain of metal sides falling off I’ll guess it’s 80% incompetence and 20% malice. (This is who programs are being cut for so that more govt money can go to his businesses?) https://www.marketwatch.com/story/elon-musk-discovers-magic-money-computers-or-how-the-u-s-financial-system-actually-works-43a21350?mod=home_lead/ “….Going back to Musk, what he’s said to have found is that the government doesn’t track terribly well the money it spends — for example, not coding each payment for precisely what it’s going toward. He told Cruz that he attributes 80% of that sloppiness to incompetence and the other 20% to malice.” ‘Elon Musk’s Tesla reportedly halts Cybertruck deliveries as owners complain of metal sides falling off’ Very much looking forward to the day that their fronts fall off – and the comments that will flow from that. Beat me to it! To state the obvious, if you were actually interested in cutting “waste, fraud, and abuse” … seems I have been hearing that phrase for the last 60 or 70 years … the logical place to start is the so-called defense budget. It is the largest slush fund. But no, we must go after Social Security and Medicaid and Medicare as there are the largest pools of money that might be put into private hands so the greedy bastards can suck out as much as they can get away with. Since we have a government of, by, and for the rich, the fat cats, the plutocrats, the oligarchs, the looters … I cannot decide the most descriptive word for them … they must be allowed to belly up, elbowing their way in. Is the appropriate emotion here disgust or rage? Both at the same time? I receive Social Security and Medicare. I paid whatever taxes were required. And now some ginned up department fronted by a really rich guy wants to blow up long established programs that work reasonably well in the name of what the profit driven call efficiency? The definition of efficiency that fuels private equity? The definition that has seen so many businesses sucked dry until the husk resembles what remains when a spider has finished a meal. Welcome to the American Nightmare. Aljazeera repeating a lie by Marco Rubio, that the US “coordinated with Russia” on the Yemeni attacks. This sort of thing at the margin is not helpful to the US improving relations with Russia, let alone getting to any sort of big deal. From the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the call: During the conversation, Marco Rubio informed him of the US decision to launch a military operation against the Houthi forces in the Red Sea region. Sergey Lavrov, in response to the arguments by the American representative, stressed the need for all parties to immediate cease the use of force and the importance for all sides to engage in political dialogue so as to find a solution that would prevent further bloodshed. Does that really qualify as total denial of Rubio’s claim? “Stressing the need for” and “totally objecting to” are different…IMO. First, the text was from the official Russian readout. It is vanishingly unlikely that it was issued to rebut Rubio. Second, “coordinated with Russia” = Russia participated in the planning. In reality, Rubio presented the US plan to Russia. Third, Russia objected to the attack by calling for diplomacy instead. So yes, Rubio lied. If the Russians leave any room for misinterpretation (or lies), it will be taken. I doubt Rubio cared one iota what the readout said. He had his story. No one reads readouts, including journos who ought to. You don’t seem to begin to get how offensive it is, and more important, disruptive to Russia’s relationships, to depict Russia as being on board with US shelling of Houthis when it absolutely is not. Rubio, the asshole he is, was probably relying on Lavrov not correcting Rubio publicly due to not wanting to sour the Trump-Putin phone call. Some poor Russian MF junior probably had to call all over the Middle East correcting the Rubio fabrications. I further do not understand why you defend America persisting in bad faith behavior. I don’t defend it. I just point it out. Basically, I’m not thinking anything has changed until I see it changed. Until Russia gets a security agreement that makes sense to them, it still seems like the plan to extend Russia is game on. “The Kingdom of Judea vs. The State of Israel” Just through demographics alone, I could very easily see a situation where secularists in Israel will become an oppressed minority but am not sure how that would work out as they pay nearly all the taxes, man nearly all the military and fill all the civil service jobs. So maybe a tolerated minority? The position of women would sink as the religious right would demand that all women leave the Israeli military and go back home to be out of sight and out of mind. You think that I am joking but when Hillary was SecState and went to Israel, a major religious publication airbrushed her and any other women out of the official photos taken. It is that weird and now these same people want to run the country. I don’t see an eventual Israeli civil war – maybe – but I can see a collapse of the State as professional Israelis will just bail out of the country. “Magnolias are so ancient they’re pollinated by beetles — because bees didn’t exist yet” This is an amazing story this and one that I would never have suspected. Magnolias were contemporary with the dinosaurs? And they are pollinated by beetles? Before bees I suppose that having beetles pollinate flowers was common but it looks like magnolias surviving all those time shows us the proof of this being so. So years ago we lived in Kentucky and often visited The Shaker Village of Pleasant Hill (https://shakervillageky.org/) outside of Lexington where I fell in love with Southern Magnolias, the big evergreens. I have been trying to grow a couple of supposedly cold-tolerant varieties here in central NY and two years ago (thanks to global warming?) I finally had a few big, waxy, lightly fragrant blossoms. And yes I noticed tiny black beetles in the flowers. I too am delighted to know more about their phylogeny. Magnolias are also pollinated by slugs. They and Old Dixie have a good PR team. Strange fruit…. Trump hypes up tensions with Iran Indian Punchline. Important Trump had shorter peacemaker stint than Obama. – ‘Every Administration Since Obama Has Been Bombing Yemen, Yet…’ – Ian Welsh (Micael T) – “Scott Ritter Should Be A Nobel Prize Winner…” It probably won’t shake my fundamental pessimism, but I’ve been struck by the very harsh criticism of Trump over the Yemen bombing by anti-war conservatives like Judge Napolitano and Larry Johnson. I saw Johnson on Nima’s Dialogue Works yesterday, and he really lit into Trump and defended AnsarAllah in terms very similar to Ian Welsh, as the only entity with the guts to stand up against the Israeli genocide. It does make you wonder what effect, if any, Trump’s apparent doubling-down on the MIGA project will have on his support. I guess we are seeing whose support is most important to him. What a world. See my Patrick Lawrence link below. And Gilbert Doctorow–who says he knew someone in Trump’s real estate operation–continues to defend Donald as an underappreciated if not totally stable genius. https://gilbertdoctorow.com/2025/03/18/why-alternative-media-are-down-on-trump/ If you ignore everything that comes out of Trump’s mouth and his all caps tweets then maybe that has weight, but personally I don’t believe a word of it. Lawrence says we may come to prefer Trump 1 to Trump 2. Trump is no genius but he is different from all the wonks. Fingers crossed that disaster doesn’t loom. Of course for Gazans it’s happening right now. I agree. The Lawrence piece is excellent as usual. And Doctorow misunderstands the Trump phenomenon in my opinion. About Trump’s “political skills” he says this: “One big factor in the underappreciation or miscomprehension of what Trump is doing comes from the underappreciation of his political skills. These skills should have been crystal clear from the very first days of his administration when he successfully pushed through the confirmation process ALL of his candidates for the top slots in his administration…” “Was this success in the confirmation votes just the result of the outstanding merits of the candidates and of their brilliant testimony in tough hearings? Of course not. It was the direct result of Trump’s marshalling his political skills, calling in chits, i.e. IOUs, issuing warnings of hell to pay in the next electoral cycle if he were to be defied.” Trump’s primary “political skill” is demagoguery – his ability to gain broad public support by pretending to be one of the “people” in opposition to “the elite.” This was made much easier by the entire Establishment joining together to oppose him, playing to his strengths. So Doctorow is not wrong in pointing to fear as Trump’s main weapon; most Republicans would not support him if they weren’t deathly afraid of how their constituents would view any opposition. But when it comes to his “titanic struggle with the Deep State” at home or abroad he is a rank amateur. As far as providing an improvement on foreign policy, he is guided by no principles or philosophy or real understanding that I can see. My prediction is that the Blob will be able to undermine any positive tendencies toward reducing tensions in Ukraine (see my above comment). And regarding Israel – Lawrence covers that well. Is this due to bribery? Blackmail? Some delusional belief in an “Abraham Accords” solution to the Middle East? Who knows. But I would better appreciate his ability to reduce Congress to sniveling sycophants if that actually lead to something positive. Unfortunately, I’m leaning more toward the disaster side right now. The video about the Federal negotiations with Columbia strikes me as an example of Trump being able to count, although here not votes but cashflow. The tactic of putting your counterparty’s financial balls in a vice until they sign your deal is scorched earth negotiation 101, i.e. pure NY real estate. He has no third term and he has no afterlife unless he permanently remakes America to be safe for Trumps (and thus his “allies”)…. One of the features of Western politics over the last decade has been the collapse of the traditional left/right paradigm. Pronouncing someone a left winger or right winger is no longer a reliable guide to what they think. I’m trying to stop using the terms all together, although after decades of use it’s hard to stop. Not only are right wingers hewing to positions that I would have formerly associated with the left (anti-war, respect for treaties and other nations, reverence for human life), but we have also seen nominally left people and parties abandoning traditional left positions in favor of performative activities so they can pile on to Trump and others, and so they can support the increasingly useless and center-right Democratic party. I don’t know if this change is exactly a bad thing, but it does mean you have to examine people and positions on a case-by-case basis. Johnson and Napolitano are good examples of people who don’t conveniently fit into any kind of pre-existing mold. I’m very glad to see this criticism. It has been disturbing to watch people like Taibbi and Greenwald, both of whom I’ve followed for a couple decades or so now, be tarred as “conservative mouthpieces” in recent years for being critical of Biden, when they have been very consistent in their criticisms of those in power over the years no matter who is president. It’s been much more recently that I started following Judge Napolitano and the guests that frequent his and other similar podcasts. They were also highly critical of Biden and hopeful that Trump would be an improvement. I’m heartened to see that they are sticking to their principles too – and it reassures me that I’ve been listening to the right people. On a related note, Greenwald had a good show yesterday, talking about Trump defying the courts, and reminding us that he is far from the first to do so and is following in the footsteps other recent administrations – https://rumble.com/v6qso9y-system-update-show-424.html I agree Greenwald also had an excellent show today, playing lots of clips of Trump campaigning as the peace president” — to cheering crowds — and excoriating him for the bombing of Yemen. MAGA folks or liberals? They each have their own type. My apologies if this has been posted. I did a search and couldn’t find it previously posted. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-10/musk-s-doge-team-sends-private-equity-veterans-to-social-security-agency Musk Taps Private Equity Veterans to Aid DOGE at Social Security Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency has sent three individuals with experience in private equity and finance to the Social Security Administration, highlighting the focus that President Donald Trump is putting on rooting out waste and fraud in the nation’s social insurance programs. Among those tapped for the task are Antonio Gracias of Valor Equity Partners, who also served on the board of Tesla Inc. and was an early investor in SpaceX — two of Musk’s companies — as well as Scott Coulter, formerly of Lone Pine Capital, and Michael Russo, formerly of Shift4, according to people familiar with the moves who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss them.

A friend who decided to take his SS payments when he was 66 about 6 years ago, was told there must be a mistake-as he’d been getting payments since he hit 62, or I should say somebody else was, unbeknownst to him. Interesting anecdotes. Multiple questions are SOP in both the private and public sectors. They’re being careful. It doesn’t necessarily indicate there’s been “quite a bit” of fraud, whatever that may mean. The Social Security Adminstration indicates there’s been very little fraud, but I suspect that may not mean much to you. So, this proposal is justified? DOGE isn’t interested in fraud. It hasn’t provided any evidence, to my knowledge, of Social Security fraud after Elon and Trump claims (lies) re millions of dead people getting SS. Yet they keep repeating it. DOGE wants to break things so agencies will function poorly, thus justifying eliminating them. When was the last time you were asked what high school you went to and the year of graduation? That was one of the questions, they were playing for keeps~ Safeguards are needed, SSA is using those safeguards, and I’d think they help to prevent fraud. Why do you think they ask them? You said a fraudulent Wukchumi could not have answered those questions. In fact, if they’re being used, and work, there would be a low amount of fraud. I used to get irritated when asked security questions but quickly realized they were helping to protect my interests. And, I know many people who receive Social Security and none have had any fraudulent issues like your friend. So, I suspect that may be a rarity. We’re supposed to trust the richest guy on the planet who thinks Social Security is a Ponzi scheme, is obviously ideologically opposed to it, to ferret out fraud? Pretty much my experience as well. I refuse to sign up for “id.me” or now I guess it’s “login.gov”. VA and IRS want me to use “login.gov” as well, so I guess my online accounts with them will go stale.

Re: Trump and Putin Talk (per the Grauniad): «18 min. ago. The Kremlin’s readout (in Russian) said Trump put forward “a proposal for the parties to the conflict to mutually refrain from attacks on energy infrastructure facilities for 30 days”. Meanwhile the White House readout said The Kremlin has continually claimed, falsely, that it has never attacked power plants used to generate electricity for civilians. For instance, following last month’s bilateral talks in Riyadh, Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, said: We clarified [to the US] that we have never threatened systems supplying power to civilians, and that only the sites directly supplying the Ukrainian armed forces have been our targets. [The Grauniad editorializes:] But repeated attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure has been a key element of Russia’s war effort. … » Devil’s Own Advocate… I get the feeling that a role reversal is in order and we Golden Billionaires are gonna be pauperazzi soon.

At Johns Hopkins, the loss of $800 million in U.S.A.I.D. grants has forced the school to lay off 2,200 foreign and domestic workers… The Trump administration announced that it was cutting $400 million in grants to Columbia University “due to the school’s continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students.” Twenty years ago, maybe even ten, I’d have found these stories about Elon Von Hitler-Musk detonating thousands of campus-related jobs horrifying. But the education sob stories now flying off the presses are a Burj Khalifa of “needs context.” A gigantic lie of omission is a constant feature of these stories: p.s. I had been argueing along this line. Of course this has been an issue in US educationa for a very long time. So none of it makes the Trump peoples´ current rampage in any way more honest. But to quote Craig Murray´s latest text, it´s the “rot of democracy”. Only where the foundation already was corrupt any of this could be pulled off. In Germany we had a very sad Tuesday. I did intend a comment on that which was however littered with curse words and I luckily fell asleep. So I will spare you that. The decision on the war budget passed with 513 votes. 489 were necessary – 203 voted against. There were none abstaining. FDP wants to go to court over this. Why? Pure lip service. Everyone should know the Constitutional Court is – fucking – w.o.r.t.h.l.e.s.s. Among CDU, GREENS, SPD there were 3 (!!!!) who voted against: Martin Diedenhofen (SPD), Mario Czaja (CDU) Canan Bayram (GREENS) Now that´s real democracy. p.s. Mrs. and Mr. Clinton visiting Berlin. So if you want to throw cream tarts now is the time. Echoes of 1914 and the SPD opening the door for WW I by voting yes on the war bond issue? https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2004/08/spdd-a06.html “Wer hat uns verraten? Sozialdemokraten! Die sogenannten ‘Demokraten’!” And five years later the same sort of people were saying that may the hand of the person signing the armistice wither. Well as far as that is concerned I have come to be thankful for the – I never expected to say this until a few years ago – Russian nuclear and non-nuclear deterrents. i.e. the parallels to 1914 end with the vote for war budget. In fact: Russians have to fight so we don´t have to. Foreign Policy has a new piece on the Oreshnik. I haven´t had time yet to sift through it but it makes me think that FP writing this is the safest sign that Pentagon finally has grasped it and then informed Hegseth´s team and that surfaced eventually with Rubio and Co. FP here: The Latest Russian Missile Is Bad News for NATO Oreshnik is a different beast from its predecessors.

China and Hong Kong condemn ‘bullying’ following deal struck amid US pressure. China is scrutinising a deal struck by a Hong Kong company to sell ports at the Panama Canal to a United States financial firm. Beijing directed multiple agencies on Tuesday to examine the transaction, according to Bloomberg News. The deal was earlier hailed by President Donald Trump, who has accused China of seeking to control the strategic waterway. Hong Kong’s CK Hutchison said earlier this month that it had agreed to sell most of its global ports business worth $22.8bn, including assets near the Panama Canal, to a group led by US-based investment company BlackRock. A week after the announcement, China’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office reposted commentaries, calling the sale a betrayal of China that neglected national interests. The deal, which is yet to be sealed, is now being investigated for security risks and antitrust violations on the orders of senior Chinese leaders, Bloomberg reported, citing unnamed sources. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Beijing said reporters should ask other Chinese authorities about the report. “I would like to stress that in principle, China has been firmly opposing infringing on or undermining other countries’ legitimate rights and interests with economic coercion and bullying,” the spokesperson said. Those words reflected earlier comments from Hong Kong’s leader John Lee. “[The Hong Kong] government urges foreign governments to provide a fair and just environment for enterprises,” Lee told reporters. “We oppose the abusive use of coercion or bullying tactics in international economic and trade relations.” Hutchison did not immediately respond to the reports of scrutiny by Beijing. The company has previously said the deal is “purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama Ports”. The firm agreed to negotiations with the BlackRock consortium on an exclusive basis for 145 days according to a statement. While the deal has not yet been finalised, it was not immediately clear what levers, if any, China could pull to block the deal, given the business that Hutchison is selling is based outside China and Hong Kong, and it is itself based in the Cayman Islands. Trump has previously called for the Panama Canal to be removed from “Chinese control”. Numerous US politicians have criticised Hutchison’s operations at the Panama Canal as a security risk.

Title: Bitcoin Storm Could Be Brewing, Crypto OnChain Options Platform Derive Says

The calm that has returned to the bitcoin (BTC) market may be short-lived, potentially setting the stage for a storm that could trigger significant price volatility, according to insights from the decentralized crypto on-chain options platform Derive. Since March 12, BTC has settled in the $80K-$85K range in a consolidation typically seen after a notable directional move. Prices tanked from $100K to under $80K in preceding weeks due to several factors, including President Donald Trump's tariffs and disappointment about the lack of new purchases in the U.S. strategic BTC reserve. With the latest consolidation, key volatility metrics have declined, nearing monthly lows. Volatility, however, is mean-reverting, meaning the low-volatility regime could soon pave the way for price turbulence, according to Derive. "BTC’s weekly at-the-money (ATM) volatility has dipped below 50% to 49%, approaching monthly lows of 45%. Realized volatility has also dropped from 91% at the start of the month to 54% today," Nick Forster, founder of Derive, wrote in a recent note shared with CoinDesk. It is important to remember that volatility is price agnostic, meaning that the expected increase in volatility does not indicate the direction of the price movement in bitcoin. “Volatility is mean-reverting, so we can expect it to rise soon, likely to levels seen in February (60-70%)," Forster added. Whether prices rise or fall, volatility can increase, suggesting that significant price swings could occur in either direction. According to Derive, several factors could trigger volatility, including "a ceasefire (or lack thereof) in Ukraine, or significant shifts in crypto regulatory policy under the Trump administration." Derive is the world's leading on-chain AI-powered options protocol with a total value locked of nearly $100 million. The protocol has registered a cumulative trading volume of $15 billion to date. Wednesday's Federal Reserve rate decision could move markets as well. The central bank is likely to keep rates unchanged, with traders pricing two to three rate cuts later this year. But a dovish surprise could recharge bulls' engines for a sharp move higher. Potential Fed rate cuts, however, could be limited, according to BlackRock. "Markets have priced in about two to three 25 basis point rate cuts this year, versus expectations for just one earlier this year. We think this reflects U.S. recession fears even though economic condition don’t point to a downturn. Even if prolonged uncertainty hurts growth, we still see persistent inflation limiting how much the Fed can cut," BlackRock said in a weekly note. The expected volatility boom could happen to the downside should equity markets continue to fall, accelerating the decline in crypto prices.

Title: Press release: Sequana Medical Obtains Convertible Financing of EUR 4.0 Million from Major Shareholders and Committed Share Subscription Facility of up to EUR 60 Million from GEM

March 18, 2025 01:45 ET | Source: Sequana Medical NV Sequana Medical NV Sequana Medical Obtains Convertible Financing of EUR 4.0 Million from Major Shareholders and Committed Share Subscription Facility of up to EUR 60 Million from GEM Ghent, Belgium – 18 March 2025 – Sequana Medical NV (Euronext Brussels: SEQUA) (the "Company" or "Sequana Medical"), a pioneer in the treatment of fluid overload in liver disease, heart failure and cancer, announces today that it has secured significant additional financing through (i) the granting of a new unsecured subordinated convertible loan of EUR 4.0 million (the "2025 Convertible Loan") by certain of its major shareholders, namely Partners in Equity V B.V. ("Partners in Equity") and EQT Health Economics 3 Coöperatief U.A. ("EQT"), and (ii) the entering into a share subscription facility agreement (the "Facility") with GEM Global Yield LLC SCS ("GEM") for up to EUR 20 million in cash (with Sequana Medical's option to increase the commitment to up to EUR 60 million in cash, once the aforementioned EUR 20 million has been drawn down) (the "Capital Commitment"). GEM is a USD 3.4 billion, Luxembourg based alternative investment group with offices in Paris, New York, and Bahamas. Pursuant to the Facility, GEM agreed to commit, subject to certain conditions, an amount up to the aforementioned Capital Commitment, within a maximum term of three years in exchange for new ordinary shares in Sequana Medical and subject to certain share lending arrangements being in place. These financing arrangements are expected to extend the Company's cash runway to the end of 2025 based on expected drawdowns of the initial EUR 20 million Capital Commitment under the Facility. In addition, the Company agreed with its existing debt providers to restructure several features of the Company's debt, subject to certain conditions and as further described below. Ian Crosbie, Chief Executive Officer of Sequana Medical, commented: "2025 is a landmark year for Sequana Medical with the US commercial launch of the alfapump® planned for mid-Q3, following the FDA approval of our PMA for this breakthrough device in December 2024. We are very pleased with the strong feedback we have received from US hepatologists who are eager to offer the alfapump® to their patients, and the potential that it offers to virtually eliminate the need for therapeutic paracentesis and transform their quality of life. Through this financing package, we have the platform to demonstrate the clear market opportunity for alfapump®, and our ability to effectively access this through our small specialty commercial team targeting US liver transplant centers. We are delighted with the continued strong support from our key shareholders and lenders, as well as the new equity commitment from GEM." About the unsecured investor financing of EUR 4.0 million Under the 2025 Convertible Loan, Partners in Equity and EQT will grant a new unsecured subordinated convertible loan to the Company for an initial aggregate principal amount of EUR 4.0 million. In addition to the new EUR 4.0 million loan, any amounts owed by the Company to Partners in Equity and EQT as lenders under the convertible loan agreement entered into on 30 September 2024 between, among others, the Company as borrower and Partners in Equity and EQT as lenders (the "2024 Convertible Loan Agreement") will be rolled-over to the 2025 Convertible Loan together with, in accordance with the provisions of the 2024 Convertible Loan Agreement, a conversion fee of 33% on such amounts. Further, the other lenders under the 2024 Convertible Loan Agreement (the "Remaining 2024 CLA Lenders") will have the option to also accede to the 2025 Convertible Loan within 10 business days from the date of the 2025 Convertible Loan. In case a Remaining 2024 CLA Lender elects to accede to the 2025 Convertible Loan, any amounts owed to such Remaining 2024 CLA Lender plus a conversion fee of 33% on such amounts shall thus be rolled-over to the 2025 Convertible Loan Agreement. Any lender under the 2025 Convertible Loan may also at any time increase the amount of loan provided by it thereunder, up to an aggregate principal amount of new money under the 2025 Convertible Loan of EUR 14 million (for the avoidance of doubt, excluding any amounts rolled over to the 2025 Convertible Loan Agreement (as described above) and excluding any interest compounded as from the date falling one business day after the date of 2025 Convertible Loan). The principal amount and interest of the 2025 Convertible Loan can be converted (in whole or in part) by the lenders for new shares of the Company at any time before the 2025 Convertible Loan has been repaid, converted or settled, at a conversion price equal to the lower of (i) the arithmetic average of the daily volume weighted average trading price per share of the Company's shares traded on Euronext Brussels during the period of twenty (20) consecutive trading days ending on (and including) the third trading day before the date on which the Company has received the equity conversion exercise notice, minus a discount of 25%, and (ii) the issue price of the new shares issued by the Company at the occasion of the most recent future equity financing before receipt of the equity conversion exercise notice, minus a discount of 25%. A lender, however, cannot acquire more than 29.9% of the outstanding issued shares of the Company through an equity conversion. If the Company enters into a new (subordinated) convertible loan which includes conversion or settlement rights equivalent to those under the 2025 Convertible Loan, each lender will be entitled to convert its 2025 Convertible Loan (in whole or in part) plus a conversion fee of 33% of all amounts owed under the 2025 Convertible Loan into the new (subordinated) convertible loan. In addition, subject to certain conditions, following the hive-down of the DSR® business into a separate entity set-up by the Company ("DSRCo") (which hive-down has already taken place) and in the event of a hive-down of the alfapump® business into a separate entity to be set-up by the Company ("LiverCo"), if the Company obtains a potential equity investment or a convertible or exchangeable debt investment into LiverCo or DSRCo for an amount of at least EUR 15 million and EUR 7.5 million respectively (a "Hive-Down Future Investment"), each lender will have the possibility to have its loan repaid (in whole or in part) by means of a payment in kind, consisting of a transfer by the Company to the relevant lender of shares issued or to be issued by LiverCo or by DSRCo. The number of LiverCo or DSRCo shares to be transferred will be equal to (i) the relevant portion of the 2025 Convertible Loan to repaid in kind (in principal and interest), divided by (ii) the issue price of the new shares which are or will be issued by LiverCo or DSRCo at the occasion of the potential Hive-Down Future Investment, minus a discount of 25%. Unless the 2025 Convertible Loan has been converted or repaid in kind as aforementioned, the respective loans of each lender will need to be repaid in cash in case of default or upon request subject to prior notice, provided, however, that a repayment request may only occur on or after the later of: (A) (x) the date falling one year after the date on which the hive-down of the alfapump® business and the respective Hive-Down Future Investment has been completed; or (y) the date on which the Company and the lenders would determine, in good faith, that the Hive-Down of the alfapump® business is not reasonably likely to occur; and (B) the date falling two years after the date of the 2025 Convertible Loan. The 2025 Convertible Loan bears interest of 15% per annum, which shall be compounded on a monthly basis. In case of conversion or repayment in kind, the minimum amount to be converted for new shares or a new convertible loan will in any event be deemed to be 10% of the aggregate initial principal amount of the loans provided by the relevant lender (minus any compounded and accrued interest which has already been paid, converted or paid in kind to the relevant lender). The proceeds from the loan will be used to finance general working capital requirements (including, without limitation, the implementation of the relevant preparatory steps with respect to each Hive-Down). About the GEM committed share subscription facility of up to EUR 60 million The Capital Commitment will be released on the basis of drawdowns by the Company in the form of subscription request notices that the Company has the right to issue at its sole discretion. Each such subscription request notice shall require GEM, subject to certain conditions, to subscribe for new ordinary shares that are to be issued by the Company. The drawdown amount reflected in such subscription request notices will be determined by the Company in function of certain parameters such as the Company's trading volume during a certain lookback period preceding the relevant subscription request notice, and the volume weighted average price (VWAP) of the Company's shares on the trading day immediately preceding the date of the relevant subscription request notice. The issue price of the new shares to be subscribed to by GEM upon settlement of a subscription request notice will be determined on the basis of 90% of the average volume weighted average price (VWAP) of the Company's shares during a forward-looking pricing period (ranging between 1 and 20 consecutive trading days following the subscription request notice and ignoring certain knockout days), it being noted that such issue price shall not be lower than a floor price that can be set by the Company in the relevant subscription request notice (and which floor price may be different in each subscription request notice). After the aforementioned pricing period, GEM will have to subscribe for a number of new ordinary shares ranging between a minimum of 50% and a maximum of 150% of the drawdown amount requested to be subscribed for by the Company (subject to certain corrections). GEM agreed not to hold an excess of 19.9% of the ordinary shares of Sequana Medical. Existing shareholders Partners in Equity and LSP HEF Sequana Holding B.V. ("LSP") agreed to adhere to the Facility, and such lending shareholders will provide GEM a number of existing Sequana Medical shares for loan covering the draw down amount reflected in the relevant subscription notice request (the "Share Lending") and subject to certain additional and bilateral arrangements regarding the share lending arrangements provided for in the Facility and as set out in a share provision support agreement (the "Support Agreement"). The aforementioned lending shareholders are not compensated for providing the Share Lending to GEM, but related expenses will be covered by the Company. In consideration for entering into the Facility, GEM is entitled to receive warrants (subscription rights) to subscribe for up to 2,620,000 new ordinary shares of the Company. The Company will seek the approval by an extraordinary shareholders' meeting ("EGM") to issue the warrants. The warrant will give GEM the right to subscribe for new shares of the Company at an exercise price per underlying ordinary share that shall be equal to the lower of (x) EUR 1.95, and (y) 117% of the average volume weighted average price (VWAP) of the Company's shares during the 10 trading days preceding the date on which the warrants will be issued by the EGM. The warrants will have a term of three years as of issuance, will be immediately exercisable, and will be subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. An affiliate of GEM is also entitled to a commitment fee of EUR 400,000, which will be settled in ordinary shares of the Company at an issue price that is equal to 90% of the average volume weighted average price (VWAP) of the Company's shares during the 10 trading days preceding the trading day preceding the date on which the relevant ordinary shares will be issued. The relevant share issue will in principle occur on the business day prior to the settlement of the Company's first subscription request notice. About the amendments to the existing loan agreements Together with the entering into the 2025 Convertible Loan and the Facility, the Company also entered into an amendment agreement (the "Kreos Amendment Agreement") pursuant to which certain repayment and other terms of the EUR 10,000,000 loan with Kreos Capital VII (UK) Limited (together with its affiliates "Kreos", and such loan the "Kreos Loan")1 will be amended. The main amendments to the Kreos Loan can be summarised as follows (for information purposes): The Company will also enter into amendments in relation to the EUR 4,300,000 partially convertible loan with PMV Standaardleningen NV (formerly known as PMV/z Leningen NV) ("PMV") (the "PMV Loan"). The main amendments to this loan consist of: Based upon the expected drawdowns of the initial 20 EUR million Capital Commitment under the Facility, the Company forecasts this financing package will extend Sequana Medical's cash runway to the end of 2025, while continuing its search for future funding and assessment of potential other options. Sequana Medical has chosen this method of fundraising as it believes it provides flexibility in this crucial year that will be punctuated by major milestones, including the expected commencement of US commercialization in the second half of 2025 through a small specialty sales force that it will establish to target 90 US liver transplant centers. Disclosures in accordance with Article 7:97, §4/1 of the Belgian Companies and Associations Code in relation to the Share Lending The following information is provided, as far as needed and applicable, pursuant to Article 7:97, §4/1 of the Belgian Companies and Associations Code in connection with the aforementioned Share Lending by Partners in Equity and LSP, the related adherence to the Facility between the Company and GEM, and the entering into of certain bilateral arrangements in relation to the Share Lending between the Company, Partners in Equity and LSP through the Support Agreement. Partners in Equity and LSP are shareholders of the Company and are represented on the board of directors of the Company. As a result, they could be considered as a "related party" within the meaning of the International Financial Reporting Standards, as adopted by the European Union (IFRS), as referred to in Article 7:97 of the Belgian Companies and Associations Code. In view hereof, the board of directors of the Company applied, as far as needed and applicable, the procedure of Article 7:97 of the Belgian Companies and Associations Code in connection with the approval of the entering into of the Facility, and the adherence thereto by Partners in Equity and LSP (in the framework of the contemplated Share Lending), and the related entering into of the Support Agreement. Ids van der Weij (a director, representing Partners in Equity) and Rudy Dekeyser (a director, representing EQT/LSP) did not participate in the deliberation and voting by the board of directors in relation to the approval of the entering into of the Facility, and the adherence thereto by Partners in Equity and LSP (in the framework of the contemplated Share Lending), and the related entering into of the Support Agreement. Within the context of the aforementioned procedure, prior to this announcement and the entering into of the Facility by the Company and GEM, and the adherence thereto by Partners in Equity and LSP, a committee of three independent directors of the Company (the "Committee") issued an advice to the board of directors in which the Committee assessed the entering into of the Facility, and the adherence thereto by Partners in Equity and LSP (in the framework of the contemplated Share Lending), and the related entering into of the Support Agreement. In its advice to the board of directors, the Committee concluded the following: "The Committee believes that, under the current circumstances and considering the current immediate, short, and mid-term working capital needs of the Company, the contemplated entering into and execution of the SSFA, and the adherence thereto by PiE and LSP in the framework of the Share Lending (including the contemplated Capital Increases, the Share Lending, and the issuance of the GEM Warrants (although subject to shareholder approval) and the Commitment Fee Shares, which each form an integral part of the SSFA), as well as the contemplated entering into and execution of the related Support Agreement, are in the interest of the Company, its shareholders and other stakeholders. While entailing additional and important potential dilution and value loss for the holders of shares and share options of the Company as a result of the different share issuances contemplated in the SSFA, and while the Investor's trading (in particular sales) in the Company's shares under the share subscription facility reflected in the SSFA may have a downward pressure on the trading price of the Company's shares on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels, ultimately the terms of the SSFA do not seem unreasonable and seem commensurate to the risks of investing in the Company taking into account the refinancing difficulties of the Company and the fact that the SSFA will allow the Company to access equity financing in a fast, flexible and efficient manner to fund its activities and its ongoing working capital requirements, while further assessing financing options and without the obligation for the Company to make use of the relevant share subscription facility. The Committee notes in this regard that if the Company is not able to raise further funding in order to address its funding requirements, the Company's going concern can no longer be guaranteed. The Committee notes in particular that the Share Lending facility by PiE and LSP (who will not receive any compensation in this respect from the Company) will allow the Investor to hedge its risks against the amount that it has committed to subscribe to pursuant to the SSFA. Without the Share Lending facility and the willingness of PiE and LSP to adhere to the SSFA as Share Providers, the Investor would not have been willing to enter into the SSFA (as the Share Lending forms an integral part of the SSFA). On balance, therefore, the Committee is of the opinion that the expected advantages of the contemplated entering into and execution of the SSFA, and the adherence thereto by PiE and LSP (in the framework of the Share Lending), and the related Support Agreement, currently exceed the expected risks and disadvantages thereof. Hence, the Committee believes that the SSFA and the adherence thereto by PiE and LSP (in the framework of the Share Lending) is in the interest of the Company, its shareholders and the other stakeholders, and that it is in any event not manifestly unlawful. In view hereof, the Committee issues a favourable and unqualified opinion to the board of directors of the Company." The Company's board of directors did not deviate from the Committee's favorable and unqualified conclusion. The Company's statutory auditor's assessment of the Committee's opinion and the minutes of the Company's meeting of the board of directors relating to the entering into of the Facility and the adherence thereto by Partners in Equity and LSP (in the framework of the contemplated Share Lending), and the entering into of the related Support Agreement, is as follows: "Based on our assessment, nothing has come to our attention that leads us to believe that the financial and accounting information mentioned in the advice of the Ad Hoc Committee of independent directors dated 14 March 2025, and in the minutes of the meeting of the board of directors dated 14 March 2025, which justify the contemplated transaction in writing and in a comprehensive manner, are not, in all material respects, fair and consistent with the information available to us within the scope of our engagement. Our engagement was solely conducted within the framework of the provisions of article 7:97 of the Belgian Companies and Associations Code, and therefore our report cannot be used in any other context." Disclosures in accordance with Article 7:97, §4/1 of the Belgian Companies and Associations Code in relation to the 2025 Convertible Loan The following information is provided pursuant to Article 7:97, §4/1 of the Belgian Companies and Associations Code in connection with the 2025 Convertible Loan granted by Partners in Equity and EQT to the Company. Partners in Equity and EQT are shareholders of the Company and are represented on the board of directors of the Company. As a result, each of them could be considered as a "related party" within the meaning of the International Financial Reporting Standards, as adopted by the European Union (IFRS), as referred to in Article 7:97 of the Belgian Companies and Associations Code. In view hereof, the board of directors of the Company applied the procedure of Article 7:97 of the Belgian Companies and Associations Code in connection with the approval of the 2025 Convertible Loan. Ids van der Weij (a director, representing Partners in Equity) and Rudy Dekeyser (a director, representing EQT/LSP) did not participate in the deliberation and voting by the board of directors in relation to the approval of the entering into of the relevant loan agreements. Within the context of the aforementioned procedure, prior to this announcement and the signing of the 2025 Convertible Loan documentation, a committee of three independent directors of the Company (the "Committee") issued an advice to the board of directors in which the Committee assessed the entering into of the 2025 Convertible Loan. In its advice to the board of directors, the Committee concluded the following: "The Committee believes that, under the current circumstances and considering the current immediate working capital needs of the Company, the entering into and execution of the 2025 Convertible Loan Agreement is in the interest of the Company, its shareholders, and other stakeholders. While subjecting the Company to increased debt, while entailing greater interest costs for the Company than the current financial indebtedness of the Company (other than the 2024 Convertible Loans), and while entailing additional and important potential dilution and/or value loss for the holders of shares and share options of the Company in case of settlement of the loans, ultimately the terms of the 2025 Convertible Loan Agreement do not seem unreasonable and seem commensurate to the risks of investing in the Company taking into account the refinancing difficulties of the Company. If the Company is not able to raise further funding in order to address its short term funding requirements, the Company's going concern can no longer be guaranteed. As far as needed and applicable, the Committee has also taken into account the debt restructuring and the entering into of the Share Subscription Facility Agreement that will be announced together with the entering into of the 2025 Convertible Loan Agreement. The Committee believes that the 2025 Convertible Loan Agreement, the Share Subscription Facility Agreement, and the debt restructuring will allow the Company to extend the Company's cash runway and to strategically focus efforts and resources on raising additional and diversified equity or other financing and to implement remedial measures. On balance, therefore, the Committee is of the opinion that the expected advantages of the entering into and execution of the 2025 Convertible Loan currently exceed the expected risks and disadvantages thereof. Hence, the Committee believes that the entering into and execution of the 2025 Convertible Loan Agreement is in the interest of the Company, its shareholders and the other stakeholders, and that it is in any event not manifestly unlawful. In view hereof, the Committee issues a favourable and unqualified opinion to the board of directors of the Company."

This causes major medical issues including increased mortality, repeated hospitalizations, severe pain, difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care, they become ineffective, intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options, resulting in poor clinical outcomes, high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing "diuretic resistant" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload, and are intended to deliver major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients, while reducing costs for healthcare systems. The Company received US FDA approval for the alfapump System for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis in December 2024, following the grant of FDA Breakthrough Device Designation in 2019. Sequana Medical intends to start US commercialisation early in the second half of 2025 through a small specialty salesforce that it will establish to target the 90 US liver transplant centers that perform 95% of liver transplants. Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure published in European Journal of Heart Failure in April 2024 support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE, a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study, have been successfully treated with DSR, resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements2. Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent, Belgium. For further information, please visit www.sequanamedical.com.

Title: Hong Kong's leader swipes at Trump but avoids criticism of tycoon's deal to sell Panama Port assets

Hong Kong’s leader says his government opposes coercion by foreign governments, an allusion to comments by U.S. President Donald Trump, but stopped short of criticizing a prominent local conglomerate’s decision to sell its Panama Canal port assets to a... HONG KONG -- Hong Kong's leader has waded into a controversy over a prominent conglomerate’s decision to sell its Panama Canal port assets to a consortium including American investment bank BlackRock Inc., a deal that has angered Beijing and highlights how escalating tensions between Beijing and Washington can leave the Chinese financial center’s business leaders trapped in the middle. Chief Executive John Lee told reporters at a weekly news briefing that CK Hutchison Holdings' in-principle agreement to sell its controlling stake in a company operating ports at both ends of the Panama Canal was being discussed extensively and concerns raised about the deal deserve serious attention. He did not specify what the concerns were. “(The) government urges foreign governments to provide a fair and just environment for enterprises,” he said. “We oppose the abusive use of coercion or bullying tactics in international economic and trade relations.” Lee avoided a direct mention of U.S. President Donald Trump and also stopped short of criticizing CK Hutchison or tycoon Li Ka-shing's family, which owns a controlling stake in the conglomerate. His comments followed a somewhat veiled backlash from Beijing. Since last Thursday, Beijing’s offices handling Hong Kong affairs have reposted two commentaries by a Beijing-backed local newspaper that blasted the deal. That has raised questions over the sale. One of the newspaper commentaries suggested the deal is a betrayal to all Chinese and disregards national interests. The other described great entrepreneurs as patriots, but suggested that businesspeople who “dance with” predatory American politicians to reap quick profits were doomed to infamy. The articles signaled Beijing’s disapproval of the deal, though its actual impact remains unclear. Posting of the articles has been seen as an indirect attack on the conglomerate by Chinese leaders. Trump, who has alleged Chinese interference with the operations of the critical shipping lane, hailed the deal, saying his administration would “reclaim” the Panama Canal. Panama President José Raúl Mulino accused him of lying. Lee said any business transaction must comply with Hong Kong's laws. The city will handle it according to the law, he said without elaborating. Increasing influence from Beijing is adding to pressure on business leaders in the former British colony, that was returned to Chinese rule in 1997. CK Hutchison did not comment on Lee’s remarks or the articles. It was due to report its 2024 financial results on Thursday, but said it did not plan a news conference. The company surprised market watchers when it announced March 4 that it would sell all shares in Hutchison Port Holdings and in Hutchison Port Group Holdings to the consortium in a deal valued at nearly $23 billion, including $5 billion in debt. Hutchison said the transaction was purely commercial and unrelated to other developments surrounding the Panama Ports. The deal, if approved, will give the BlackRock consortium control over 43 ports in 23 countries, including the ports of Balboa and Cristobal, located at either end of the Panama Canal. Other ports are in Mexico, the Netherlands, Egypt, Australia, Pakistan and elsewhere. The transaction requires approval by Panama’s government. It does not affect a trust that operates ports in Hong Kong or any other ports in mainland China. Panama says it has full control over the shipping lane and Hutchison's operation of the ports does not amount to Chinese control over the canal. Selling it to a U.S.-based company does not represent any U.S. “reclaiming” of the canal, it says. The United States built the canal in the early 1900s, seeking a faster way for commercial and military vessels to travel between its coasts. Washington relinquished control of the waterway to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, under a treaty signed in 1977 by then-President Jimmy Carter. Trump has claimed that Carter “foolishly” gave the canal away. Some 70% of the sea traffic that crosses the Panama Canal leaves or goes to U.S. ports. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

With New York critics loving his solo show, painter Paul Hughes talks about creativity Paul Hughes worked for Saatchi & Saatchi as a strategist On a Dublin 4 lane, you press the bell, a black metal grille is raised; you cross a courtyard and step into Paul Hughes’s bright studio. Music thrums and pulses. Sometimes it’s Vivaldi and Puccini, sometimes Philip Glass or Irish trad. Today it’s The KVB. The paintings, on the walls or stacked against them, are dazzlingly colourful. On the floor, tubes and tubs of paint. One work in particular – 5m x 2m, and as yet untitled – sings. It’s partly painted with his fingers, a hands-on work, and has a child-like energy and vibrancy that marks a new direction in Hughes’s work. Have you tried Focail and Conundrum?

Title: Bitcoin Spot ETFs bleed $900M over 5 weeks – Is investor confidence shattered?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/bitcoin-spot-etfs-bleed-900m-over-5-weeks-is-investor-confidence-shattered/
Time Published: 2025-03-17T22:00:29Z
Full Content:
Bitcoin Spot ETFs have been bleeding funds, with $900M in outflows over the past five weeks. Bitcoin [BTC] Spot ETFs have been experiencing a notable decline in inflows, with over $900 million in outflows recorded in the last five weeks. This sharp drop has fueled speculation about whether investor confidence in Bitcoin is beginning to wane. As institutional investors adjust their portfolios amid economic and regulatory uncertainty, Bitcoin’s price has also been affected, dipping nearly 12% in the past month. With market sentiment shifting, a closer analysis of Bitcoin Spot ETF flows, and price trends is crucial to understanding where the market is headed. According to recent data from Sosovalue, BTC Spot ETFs have seen sustained outflows, with the latest weekly figures showing a net outflow of $921.4 million. This marks the fifth consecutive week of declining capital within these funds, bringing the total outflow to approximately $5.4 billion since mid-February. While BTC Spot ETFs initially saw significant inflows after their approval, recent redemptions suggest a shift in investor sentiment. Source: Sosovalue The timing of these outflows has coincided with Bitcoin’s price decline, which has dropped from $84,000 to approximately $77,000. While broader market factors contribute to Bitcoin’s volatility, the persistent ETF outflows indicate that institutional investors might be more cautious toward Bitcoin allocations in their portfolios. One of the key advantages of BTC Spot ETFs is their ability to attract institutional investors into the cryptocurrency market. Prominent asset management firms like BlackRock and Fidelity introduced Bitcoin ETFs, offering a regulated investment option that provided Bitcoin exposure without requiring direct ownership. This led to an initial surge in inflows and contributed to Bitcoin reaching an all-time price high. However, institutional investors often utilize strategic, short-term capital allocation methods. During periods of market uncertainty, they tend to adjust positions swiftly, potentially explaining the current outflows. Analysts suggest that institutional investors could be redirecting funds to traditional assets or higher-yield opportunities as global financial markets react to inflation concerns and regulatory changes. There are several contributing factors to the recent BTC Spot ETF redemptions. One of the most significant concerns is macroeconomic conditions. Rising interest rates and inflation fears have led investors to reevaluate their portfolios, often prioritizing lower-risk assets over volatile markets like cryptocurrencies. With traditional markets offering more attractive risk-adjusted returns, Bitcoin Spot ETFs may face increased competition from traditional investment vehicles. Additionally, Bitcoin’s price volatility plays a role. Historically, large price corrections have triggered sell-offs, and the current price dip may have led some investors to liquidate their BTC holdings to secure profits or minimize losses. Despite the recent outflows, the long-term outlook for BTC Spot ETFs remains positive. The introduction of these funds has already had a positive effect on the cryptocurrency market, and there are indications that institutional adoption will continue to grow. However, in the short term, investors will closely monitor macroeconomic trends, regulatory developments, and Bitcoin’s ability to reclaim key price levels. If Bitcoin can stabilize above $80,000, it may regain investor confidence, leading to renewed inflows into BTC Spot ETFs. On the other hand, if outflows persist and Bitcoin struggles to find support, a prolonged period of market uncertainty could follow.

Ted Cruz (R-TX) during the "Verdict" podcast sit-down. “They just send money out of nothing.” The computers identified by Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, exist at multiple agencies, Musk added, pointing to the U.S. Treasury Department, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, U.S. Department of State, and U.S. Department of Defense. Musk claimed his team has found 14 computers with blank-check authority at the federal government, and suggested that they routinely send trillions of dollars to keep Washington up and running. While Musk’s fixation on government spending has been brewing for months, his latest comments on the government’s payment powers alarmed Bitcoin fans who have long viewed it as a hedge against currency degradation. In 2013, the term “magic internet money” became popularized within Bitcoin’s community after a Reddit user created a viral ad using the slogan. The meme’s crudely illustrated mascot has since become the central focus of Taproot Wizards’ line of Bitcoin-based collectibles. Bitcoin’s portrayal as a store of value has often been linked to money-printing. Generally, Bitcoiners believe a government can create as much cash as it wants, while Bitcoin’s supply will never exceed 21 million BTC due to the way that its software was coded. The sentiment has been echoed by influential figures on Wall Street, including BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. In January, he said Bitcoin appeals to investors fearful of their local currency being debased through government spending, describing Bitcoin as “a currency of fear.” Musk’s attempts to slash costs have contributed to recession fears, as market participants weigh how federal jobs cuts could affect economic growth and consumer spending. However, the accuracy of DOGE’s purported spending cuts has faced scrutiny. As news publications have identified errors in DOGE's savings claims, the cost-cutting team has progressively made data posted to the DOGE website—where Dogecoin’s logo was recently added and then swiftly removed—harder to decipher, according to The New York Times. Musk has said DOGE will “act quickly to correct any mistakes,” but recent savings claims have been made with less data for identifying which contracts have purportedly been cut. Musk took issue with the government’s spending procedures in the podcast published on Monday, but he acknowledged the magic machines are “not totally wrong” in terms of how much money is being spent compared to what's reported. In terms of the amount they spend, they’re “probably off” by up to 10% in some cases, he claimed.

Title: LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault Extends His Own Retirement Age Again to 85
URL: https://observer.com/2025/03/lvmh-bernard-arnault-extend-retirement/
Time Published: 2025-03-17T17:59:52Z

Is 85 the new 65? Bernard Arnault, CEO and chairman of the French luxury conglomerate LVMH (LVMHF), sure hopes so. The 76-year-old billionaire is once again asking shareholders to extend his impending retirement. A proposal to amend LVMH’s bylaws and raise the age limit of its CEO and chairman positions from 80 to 85 will be heard during the conglomerate’s annual meeting on April 17, according to company documents. This isn’t the first time Arnault, who has led LVMH for some 35 years, has attempted to prolong his time in power—back in 2022, he successfully raised the company’s CEO retirement age from 75 to 80.

You can opt out anytime. LVMH owns brands like Louis Vuitton, Dior (CHDRY) and Tiffany & Co. Last year, the group raked in nearly 85 billion euros ($92.8 billion) in revenue. Arnault, currently the world’s fifth richest person with an estimated net worth of $170.9 billion, has remained tight-lipped over which of his five children will take the reins once he finally steps down. Arnault’s four sons and one daughter all currently hold roles within their father’s luxury empire. His eldest child, Antoine, serves as head of communication and image at LVMH, while Delphine is CEO and chairman of Christian Dior Couture. Frédéric, meanwhile, was recently named CEO of the cashmere brand Loro Piana. Alexandre and Jean work as head of Moët Hennessy and director of watches at Louis Vuitton, respectively. The LVMH leader has previously found support in his bucking of traditional retirement ages from the likes of Warren Buffett, who is turning 95 this year. After initially raising his retirement age to 80 three years ago, the French billionaire reportedly received a letter from Buffett saying the new limit was still too low. Buffett, who has run Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) for 60 years, has long praised the seniority of his older executives. During Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting in 2024, he quipped that “anybody who wants to retire at 65 would be disqualified from being CEO of Berkshire.” The investor’s thoughts on retirement are admired by fellow billionaire Bill Gates, who is currently 69 years old and last year stated that he’d like to follow Buffett’s lead and continue working for two to three more decades. Such approaches contrast the standard retirement age of 65 in the U.S.—an age that Larry Fink, chairman of BlackRock, thinks should be increased. In a 2024 investor letter that pointed to the increased strain of America’s Social Security Administration amid a rise in retired citizens, Fink noted that it’s a “bit crazy” that the U.S. still abides by a retirement age that originates from the time of the Ottoman Empire. Similar financial issues are underway in France, which recently saw French President Emmanuel Macron raise the country’s retirement age from 62 to 64 to allow pension systems to keep up with its retirees. French citizens, however, don’t appear to share Arnault’s sentiments around extending retirement. They quickly took aim at billionaires like the LVMH head, arguing they should shoulder some of the responsibility for financing pensions. The protests culminated in more than 100 French workers storming LVMH’s Paris headquarters in April 2023. We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Title: Blackrock beat Terenure to retain Leinster Schools Senior Cup title
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2025/03/17/blackrock-beat-terenure-to-retain-leinster-schools-senior-cup-title/

Full Content:
‘72! 72! 72!’ The chant rose into the cloud-covered sky as Blackrock captain Sam Bishti lifted the Leinster Schools Senior Cup after securing the school’s 72nd title at Tallaght Stadium on Monday. On the evidence of previous rounds, the two most physical schools made it to St Patrick’s Day. An early indiscretion by Blackrock offered an attacking platform which Terenure used to spring centres Alvaro Swords and Michael Kennedy. The ball was moved at speed to build momentum and Blackrock edged the kicking contest for a five-metre lineout. Hooker Harry O’Neill’s throw was grabbed by Michael Walsh to secure possession. From the back of the ensuing maul, O’Neill dotted down to give Blackrock a 5-0 lead on eight minutes. Now trailing, Terenure’s Geoff O’Sullivan and Swords led the pushback, breaking tackles to open up the ‘Rock’s defence, but without the vital support runners their efforts amounted to little. A scrum penalty in the 18th minute offered Terenure’s way into the game, outhalf Gareth Morgan striking from 30 metres to make it 5-3. The deficit reduced to two points, Terenure’s confidence in moving the ball grew, O’Sullivan providing the greatest threat. Coming under pressure, Blackrock’s indiscipline cost them when Morgan shot Terenure into the lead with a penalty in the 27th minute. With half-time approaching, Luke McNiff got a hand to a five-metre lineout, offloading to Mikey Smyth who kicked long for James Browne to gather. Jamie Coleman nudged the ball into touch to bring about the break, Terenure holding a 6-5 lead. The even nature of the contest put discipline to the fore. A hand in the ruck was all Paddy Clancy needed to recover the lead for Blackrock, nailing a penalty in front of the posts in the 42nd minute to make it 8-6. The agility of Blackrock flanker Michael O’Sullivan on the floor was good for a penalty and position inside the 22, where a forward pass was greeted with joy by Terenure supporters. But their decision to run the ball out proved costly when Artur Smykovskiy swooped for a penalty on the 40-metre line which Clancy slotted over for 11-6 in the 49th minute. Terenure, however, looked to have put themselves back ahead when Swords, playing with penalty advantage, reached for the line. But it wasn’t to be, the try chalked off for obstruction in the lead up. Instead they had to make do with another penalty from Morgan to make it a two-point game in the 53rd minute. Terenure pushed hard in possession, but when the ball went to ground Albert Lindner smartly tumbled a kick for a 50-22 to Blackrock. Terenure recovered the ball as Blackrock’s concentration slipped under pressure, but Lindner was again on hand, this time snatching an interception. The scramble defence was laudable but not squeaky clean, giving Clancy the opportunity to land a routine penalty to extend Backrock’s lead to 14-9 in the 62nd minute. A scrum penalty offered Terenure a much-needed reprieve. Clancy duly stepped up to the kicking tee on the 40-meter line but his effort, while on target, dropped short. That left Terenure with just one last chance, Swords, O’Sullivan, Ethan Balamash, Senan Gavin, captain Ben Blaney and others combining in search of a late try. Ultimately, Blackrock’s forwards held firm to keep Terenure out. Under pressure, they would not be broken. BLACKROCK: J Reddan; J Browne, J O’Sullivan, B White, A Vetjens; P Clancy, A Lindner; B Guerin, H O’Neill, S Bishti (capt); G Wall, A Smykovskiy; M Walsh, M O’Sullivan, B Walsh. Replacements: L Coffey for Lindner (62 mins); L Golden for Guerin (68). TERENURE: G O’Sullivan; E Balamash, M Kennedy, A Swords, B Dohnal; G Morgan, J Coleman; P Kelly, L Zelman, A Cooper; L McNiff, F Maher; J Mooney, M Smyth, B Blaney (capt).

Sofa Queen: $968 is not nearly enough to survive on, even on generic cat food, but if you're receiving SSI benefits when you're 62, that's what you get, no matter what age you "retire" or how much you've put in the system. Sucks, but at least I own my house. It's a shiatty house in need of some major repairs, but it's mine and taxes are cheap in Arizona. I pay about $160 in property taxes a year because I live in one of the most impoverished counties in the western united states. If something were to happen to my car, I'd be f*cked....This is depressing to even write about, so I'm going to stop now. Cewley: I took SS at 62. Both parents died in their 70s.

I think they will absolutely move the ages higher. Maybe 65 to start and 75 for full. Something like that. My fear is they might send the funds through Wall Street via Blackrock in some attempt to juice returns. That would be incredibly dangerous.We'll see. They are def going to f*ck with payments and people are going to be in trouble. Guarantee that. Already happening.Keep an eye on your relations and friends on it and be ready to help if you can.

Title: Who Is Satoshi? Benjamin Wallace Goes Down the Rabbit Hole in New Book

Full Content:
Who created Bitcoin? More than 16 years ago, on Halloween Day of 2008, an entity by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto sent out the whitepaper for a peer-to-peer electronic cash system to a cypherpunk email list. Bitcoin launched shortly thereafter; it quickly spawned a global cultural movement and a multi-trillion dollar industry. Benjamin Wallace wrote a piece on the phenomenon for WIRED in November 2011, making him one of the very first mainstream journalists to ever cover the crypto space. Back then, nobody seemed to know Nakamoto’s identity, and despite robust efforts, Wallace couldn’t figure it out either. Amusingly, the author of “The Billionaire’s Vinegar: The Mystery of the World's Most Expensive Bottle of Wine” (2009) was sucked back into the enigma in 2022 after receiving persistent emails from an ex-Tesla employee who was absolutely convinced that Elon Musk was Nakamoto all along. Wallace stays clear of that particular theory, but he lays out his own findings in “The Mysterious Mr. Nakamoto,” a 342-page investigation set for release on March 18.Read more: Marc Hochstein - Satoshi Nakamoto: The Mystery That (Probably) Will Never Be Solved The conclusion? Well, by the end of it, Wallace is forced to admit that he failed to solve the Nakamoto riddle once again. But his obsession yielded a thoughtful survey of Bitcoin’s history with a special emphasis on the cypherpunks whose ideas contributed to the cryptocurrency’s birth. “The Mysterious Mr. Nakamoto” is a perfect work for crypto veterans and beginners alike who are curious to know more about Bitcoin’s origins; in that respect, it’s comparable to Laura Shin’s “The Cryptopians: Idealism, Greed, Lies, and the Making of the First Big Cryptocurrency Craze” (2022), which focuses on Vitalik Buterin and Ethereum’s early days. Wallace shuffles through a long list of suspects throughout the book. His favourites include Hal Finney, the recipient of the first-ever bitcoin transaction; Nick Szabo, who designed a digital currency in the 1990s called “bit gold”; Len Sassaman, one of the main developers and operators of the Mixmaster remailer; the relatively obscure cypherpunk James A. Donald; and longtime Bitcoin critic Ben Laurie. One of the things that makes “The Mysterious Mr. Nakamoto” a fun read is that you can watch Wallace slowly go insane as he bounces back and forth between these names. Each time he narrows it down to one person, a new piece of information rolls in and detonates his theory. Wallace deserves credit for his multi-faceted approach to the affair. He makes abundant use of stylometry for Nakamoto’s emails and code, deeply investigates circumstantial evidence, interviews almost all of the potential candidates, and even learns to code to get a better grasp of what the cypherpunks are talking about. Looming over the investigation, of course, is the debate over whether Satoshi Nakamoto’s identity even matters in the first place. There has been renewed interest in the question lately, between HBO’s “Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery” documentary (which came out last fall) and VanEck’s head of digital assets Matthew Sigel stating in February that he believed Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey created Bitcoin. As Wallace notes, Nakamoto’s identity is one of the great secrets of the 21st century. With Wall Street and the White House beginning to fully embrace the crypto sector, there is perhaps a feeling that putting a face on Bitcoin’s inventor is necessary to make the digital asset a little cleaner and safer to integrate into the global financial system. Nakamoto’s identity is crucial because its discovery would impact the way people see Bitcoin, Wallace argues. Crypto folks, he says, prefer to think of Satoshi as a kind of promethean figure that unleashed Bitcoin as a gift to mankind before disappearing for the greater good. But what if Nakamoto was an outright criminal like former cartel boss Paul Le Roux who simply cannot access his private keys because he’s behind bars? Would BlackRock and Fidelity still race to recommend exposure to the cryptocurrency to their clients? Wallace eventually sort of settles on the idea that Hal Finney probably took part in Bitcoin’s creation, but that he likely wasn’t working alone, and that in any case any theory is almost impossible to verify without Nakamoto providing irrevocable proof. But “The Mysterious Mr. Nakamoto” is crafted intelligently and the lack of resolution does not feel anti-climactic. At the end of the day, it’s all about the chase. “What could we possibly learn from Nakomoto’s biography?” Wallace muses at some point, after a friend of his suggests the story would be better without an answer. “That he was a random professor who’d had a lucky brainstorm? No, what was most interesting about Nakamoto was his absence. He was defined by what we didn’t know about him.” Tom writes about markets, bitcoin mining and crypto adoption in Latin America.

Title: Home of The Best Meme Coins, Solana, Turns Five

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Solana celebrated its 5th birthday yesterday. In honour of the occasion, we decided to take a look at this blockchain’s journey to becoming a leading platform and the home of the best meme coins. Solana was launched on March 16, 2020, by Solana Labs CEO Anatoly Yakovenko and Solana co-founder Raj Gokal and his team. That was right around the time the entire world was forced into lockdown by the COVID-19 pandemic. Some 408B transactions and close to $1T in trading on DEXs later, today Solana is second only to Ethereum in terms of total value locked, at $6.85B. Solana was designed to address the scalability issues that plagued the likes of the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains. And, over the past five years, it has been widely adopted in areas such as DeFi, NFTs, gaming, Web3 applications, and – of course – as the launchpad for some of the best meme coins. The high-speed, low-cost Layer 1 blockchain has had its fair share of ups and downs over the past five years. At the peak of the 2020–2021 bull run, Solana’s market cap surged to $77.8B. However, it plummeted by a massive 96% in late 2022. The Solana price fell to $8.30, and its market cap bottomed out at around $3B. Yet, Solana has proven quite the comeback kid, thanks in large part to the meme coin craze. Last year, the meme coin market exploded, and its collective market cap grew by 330%, according to CEX.io. Solana’s impressive speed (up to 65K transactions per second), low costs, strong community, and developer-friendly environment have made it the go-to blockchain for the best altcoins, giving it a considerable edge over competitors. As Solana celebrates its 5th birthday, it seems good things are in store for this blockchain. For one, US President Donald Trump recently announced $SOL will be included in the country’s proposed strategic reserve. Institutional players are acknowledging Solana’s strong position – with the likes of asset manager BlackRock on the brink of launching $SOL spot ETFs. Solana also has two protocol upgrades in the pipeline. The first, SIMD 0123, proposes a system whereby Solana’s priority fees go to validator stakers. This should boost staking rewards, block off-chain transactions, and improve on-chain processing. SIMD 0228, meanwhile, is a proposal to change how new $SOL tokens are released, in a bid to make token issuance more balanced and efficient. Instead of a fixed schedule, staking rewards would adjust based on how many people are staking. Solana’s ecosystem continues to flourish in the cryptocurrency and Web3 landscape, proving that speed, efficiency, and innovation can co-exist in a decentralized world. That said, the Solana blockchain is still known for traffic congestion and failed transactions. To the rescue comes Solaxy ($SOLX), the meme coin behind the world’s first-ever Solana Layer 2 ecosystem. $SOLX aims to build on Solana’s good points (speed and low transaction costs) by boosting scalability and adding even more speed. As an Ethereum-based token, Solaxy will bridge Solana and Ethereum, meaning $SOLX holders will be able to capitalize on the strength of these two blockchain powerhouses. This is exciting news for the crypto world, and investors are taking note. The Solaxy presale has raised $26.7M since it launched in December last year. Right now, 1 $SOLX costs $0.0016666 (with 153% staking rewards). Being a presale, however, it won’t stay that low for long. If you’re interested in investing in what is potentially a game changer for Solana, the Solaxy whitepaper is a good starting point, as is the $SOLX X channel. Our guide to buying $SOLX will walk you through the steps if you decide this is the investment for you. Remember to do your own research, as we’re not financial advisers. That said, it will be exciting to see what’s in store for the Solana blockchain if the last five years are anything to go by.

Title: BlackRock CEO: Social Security Reform With Private Investment Accounts

[+] change: let Americans invest part of their Social Security taxes into private accounts for retirement. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink put Social Security reform in the spotlight, suggesting a potentially controversial change: let Americans invest part of their Social Security taxes into private accounts for retirement. Speaking at BlackRock’s retirement summit, Fink argued this would allow workers to earn higher returns through the market. "The problem we have now, we have a plan called Social Security that doesn’t grow with the economy," Fink said​ as reported by Semafor, pointing out the current program’s meager bond-bound growth. Fink’s proposal centers on boosting retirees' returns by harnessing the stock market's long-term performance. Today, Social Security's trust funds invest only in special U.S. Treasury bonds with modest yields. By contrast, investing a portion in stocks could let retirement savings "grow with your country," said Fink, as reported in Semafor. .​ "If we create a plan that every American can grow with our economy, they’re going to feel more attached to our economy," Fink added, suggesting that owning a stake in real assets would make workers more optimistic about their golden years than relying solely on a government check. Crucially, Fink isn’t advocating ditching Social Security’s guaranteed benefit. He envisions personal investment accounts as a voluntary supplement to the baseline benefit, not a substitute. This nuance echoes the stance of many retirement experts and aligns with AARP, the nation’s most significant seniors’ lobby. Marie F. Smith, former president of the organization, said to The New York Times in 2004 that the group "adamantly opposes replacing any part of Social Security with individual accounts." However, she added that AARP supported incentives for people to establish personal retirement accounts in addition to Social Security. The organization’s former policy director, John Rother, echoed this view, saying, "We favor private accounts when they are in addition to Social Security, but not as a substitute." Fink's idea aligns with that philosophy – aiming to enhance retirees' overall security without undermining the safety net. The concept of privatizing Social Security isn’t new. In 2005, President George W. Bush proposed letting workers invest a portion of their Social Security taxes in personal accounts. The plan met fierce resistance. Democrats blasted it as an attempt to privatize the program, and even many Republicans got cold feet. Opposition helped wreck Bush’s second-term agenda and the proposal died in Congress. Americans were unconvinced that turning a guaranteed benefit into a market gamble was worth it. Critics warned that diverting payroll taxes to Wall Street could force benefit cuts or balloon the deficit to pay current retirees. Spooked by the risks, the public balked – and since 2005, the notion of privatizing Social Security has been essentially political poison. By floating private accounts, Fink has reopened the long-running debate about risk versus reward in retirement security. Proponents argue that Social Security’s government-run trust fund doesn’t generate enough growth. According to Investopedia, they believe investing even a portion of contributions in equities could "deliver higher benefits for participants" over time. The potential upside is higher returns and personal ownership of retirement assets that individuals control. A recent post on X by David Friedberg, CEO of Ohala, makes the case cogently. “If instead of buying treasuries, OASI [the Social Security Trust Fund] bought the S&P500 index starting in 1971 (the year the US went off the gold standard), it would have a $15.1 trillion balance today and Americans would all share ownership of ~1/3 of America’s best companies, likely supporting increased retirement benefits, lowering taxes, and reducing Federal debt levels while being the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund. Instead, OASI has a $2.7 trillion balance today and is projected to go bankrupt in 2032, as retirement benefits swell while annual returns on US treasuries held by OASI have shrunk to <3% per year recently.” Opponents counter with a clear warning: those higher returns come with higher risk. What if the market crashes at the wrong time? Social Security’s great strength is that it guarantees a lifelong benefit regardless of market conditions – a safety net that privatization could weaken. Rep. John Larson (D-Conn.), a vocal defender of the program, notes that during the 2008 financial crisis, many 401(k) accounts plunged in value, yet "Social Security never missed a payment."​ To Larson and like-minded critics, exposing the bedrock of Americans' retirement to Wall Street volatility is an unacceptable gamble. They also point to the transition problem: diverting payroll taxes into private accounts leaves less money to pay current retirees, likely requiring painful benefit cuts or large federal debt in the interim. This daunting transition cost is a key reason past privatization efforts faltered. On the other hand, supporters of reform say Social Security's looming financial shortfall means all options should be considered. The program's main trust fund is projected to run out of reserves by 2033, after which it could only pay about 79% of promised benefits​. To advocates of private accounts, harnessing market growth is one way to help fill that funding gap – potentially reducing the need for big tax hikes or benefit cuts. They argue that accepting some market risk now may be preferable to an automatic 21% benefit reduction later. Despite the renewed buzz, Social Security reform that includes adding private accounts faces an uphill battle in Washington. Republican lawmakers, mindful of the 2005 backlash, have mostly avoided endorsing private-account ideas. Polls suggest the idea remains unpopular – a recent survey found that voters across party lines "overwhelmingly oppose" efforts to privatize Social Security​, according to Data For Progress. Still, Fink's high-profile advocacy shines a new spotlight on this once-taboo proposal. His stature as head of the world's largest asset manager lends weight to the conversation, and his emphasis on supplementing (not replacing) Social Security could make the concept more palatable to some. Any serious move toward private accounts would require safeguards to preserve Social Security's guaranteed benefits, and even then, it would ignite fierce debate. Lawmakers must convince a skeptical public that such a reform won't jeopardize the checks seniors rely on. For additional article on Social Security reform and current events:

Title: US exodus drives crypto ETP outflows to record $6.4B but XRP defies downturn

XRP investment products reach $1.2 billion AuM despite crypto sector's outflows of $6.4 billion Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Investment in crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) took a heavy hit last week, with outflows reaching $1.7 billion, according to the latest CoinShares report. This marks the fifth consecutive week of capital flight, bringing total outflows to $6.4 billion—an all-time high. As a result, year-to-date inflows for the sector have now dropped to $912 million. James Butterfill, CoinShares’ Head of Research, highlighted that the market has endured 17 consecutive days of outflows—the longest streak recorded since data tracking of global crypto ETPs began in 2015. According to him, the prolonged downturn has caused total assets under management (AuM) to shrink by $48 billion to $133 billion. Investors in the United States led the exodus, accounting for 93% of the total outflows last week, with $1.16 billion leaving the market. The heavy outflows can be linked to the fact that US spot Bitcoin ETF providers, including BlackRock, Grayscale, Fidelity, and Ark 21Shares, saw outflows of $401 million, $134 million, $317 million, and $68 million, respectively. This resulted in Bitcoin-related investment products recording $978 million in outflows, bringing their five-week flows to a negative $5.4 billion. Short-Bitcoin positions also saw sell-offs, with investors withdrawing $3.6 million amid Bitcoin’s sideways price action. Meanwhile, Ethereum and Solana investment products experienced outflows of $175 million and $2.2 million, respectively. Blockchain equity funds also suffered, with $40 million exiting the sector. Butterfill pointed out that Binance faced a near-total wipeout of its AuM after a seed investor’s departure, leaving only $15 million under management. XRP stood out as a rare bright spot, attracting $1.8 million in fresh inflows last week. This brought its monthly total to $7.4 million, ranking it second only to Solana, which led with $14.2 million in inflows. For the year, XRP remains one of the best-performing assets, with $212 million in inflows—trailing only Bitcoin’s $612 million and Ethereum’s $412 million. The rising demand has driven XRP investment products to a record high of $1.2 billion in total assets under management. Several market factors have fueled this momentum. The long-running legal dispute between Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) appears to be approaching a resolution, with both parties reportedly working toward a settlement. At the same time, reports also suggest that the SEC may consider classifying the digital asset as a commodity, which could boost the likelihood of approving an XRP-focused spot ETF product. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential. He imparts insights on a range of topics like DeFi, hacks, mining and culture, underlining transformative power.

Verified Pools blend KYC integration and advanced liquidity management to meet rising institutional demand for crypto investments. Survey shows 83% of institutional investors plan increased crypto allocation, with stablecoin use leading the charge. Hines highlighted how fast crypto regulation is advancing under Trump's administration, praising the regulators' work. According to analysts, banking license lowers borrowing costs, improves capital access, and enhances legitimacy in customers' eyes. Crypto analysts liken Strategy's risky dividend plan to historical hedge fund calamities, raising alarms. US investors retreat from Bitcoin as trade tariffs and stock volatility shake confidence. Dragonfly's Haseeb Qureshi said the EF is shifting focus from research-driven efforts to fostering project development and investment. Heavy ETF outflows suggest institutional support has weakened, and Bitcoin needs renewed interest from long-term holders or institutions.

Title: The Great Un-Wokening Meets the Campus Resistance

Skip to comments. Posted on 03/17/2025 5:32:13 AM PDT by karpov Many of America’s large corporations are beating a retreat from their former commitments to saving the planet from catastrophic climate change. They are also reassessing their earnest allegiance to DEI policies. Indeed, the whole apparatus of ESG (“environmental, social, and governance”) policies in the for-profit sector now looks a bit like the Pacific Palisades after the fire. Not just climate and race stuff, but other progressive causes, including “gender diversity” and “aspirational hiring,” are facing early retirement. The list of companies that are participating in what might be called the Great Un-Wokening is impressively long and, in its way, diverse. State Street (asset management), Warner Bros. (mediocre movies), Paramount (“A Mountain of Entertainment”), Goldman Sachs (investing in everything), BlackRock (ditto), Citigroup (more of the same), Pepsi and Coca-Cola (carbonated beverages), Google (advertisement emporium) and Disney (worse-than-mediocre movies and overpriced theme parks) stand out, but the list is much longer. Exactly why an epidemic of sanity has broken out in the corporate world is a topic for wiser heads than mine. It could be that these companies are tired of squandering money on silly ideological crusades, or it could be a collective reawakening to the wisdom of Adam Smith. Great shifts in the capital spirit seldom occur without responsive echoes in the American academy.

* CK Hutchison and sister company to report results on Thursday * State-owned media posts second critical editorial on port deal * China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office reposted commentary By Clare Jim HONG KONG, March 17 (Reuters) - Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK Hutchison, which is facing pressure from Beijing authorities over a port deal with a BlackRock-led consortium, will not hold earnings conferences this week, two sources with knowledge of the matter said. CK Asset, a property developer in Hong Kong which also has interests in overseas utility assets, told Reuters on Monday it will not hold analyst and media conferences. "This is very rare for a blue-chip company not to hold an earnings conference," said an analyst briefed on the matter, who declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media. "The company has not said anything since the port deal. The stock market could view this negatively." Both companies are due to report their 2024 financial results on Thursday. Neither provided the reasons for their decisions. While CK Hutchison confirmed it will not hold a media briefing when asked by Reuters, it did not say whether it still planned to hold an analyst briefing. They have held analyst conferences for both their semi-annual and annual results for many years as well as media briefings for their annual results. CK Hutchison said this month it had agreed to sell most of its global ports business, including assets it holds along the strategically important Panama Canal, to a group led by BlackRock. It will receive more than $19 billion in cash proceeds under the deal. U.S. President Donald Trump, who has called for the Panama Canal to be removed from what he says is Chinese ownership, has hailed the deal. China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO) on Thursday reposted a commentary criticising the deal as a betrayal of China, sending the conglomerate's shares sharply lower the following day. The article, originally published in Hong Kong-based state-owned newspaper Ta Kung Pao, said the deal neglects national interests and shows CK Hutchison is profit-seeking. HKMAO on Saturday reposted another Ta Kung Pao editorial in which the paper criticised CK Hutchison and said Hong Kong companies must stand with China in the face of what it called "U.S. hegemony".

Title: Lowell Lenders Push to Get Better Terms as Part of Debt Deal

(Bloomberg) -- The lenders to British debt collector Lowell are seeking better terms as part of a deal that would see the company extend its maturities and get fresh cash from its bondholders. The creditors exposed to a revolving credit facility want an improvement to some of the conditions put forward by the company, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the process is confidential. They include banks, but also funds Alinor Capital and Värde Partners on a sub-participation basis, some of the people said. Discussions are ongoing between the creditors, the company and bondholders who support the transaction. The company needs the backing of the revolving credit facility lenders to implement a consensual transaction, Lowell said in a statement on Jan. 24. The debt collector is backed by the private equity firm Permira. In December, Lowell reached agreement with some bondholders to extend the maturity of its notes by three years, while repaying some of them in cash and reinstating another part as payment-in-kind debt. The company was supported by investors including BlackRock Inc. and Invesco Ltd. In January it won the backing of its largest creditor, Arini Capital Management, by adding €250 million of new money to the proposal. The fresh cash will be provided by bondholders. As part of the deal, the revolving credit facility would see its maturity extended to August 2028. While the collateral package and the covenants would be improved, the deal would preserve the same pricing and other terms, according to a presentation by Lowell. Lowell had been in talks for months with its bondholders on how to address its nearing maturities with the help of advisers PJT Partners Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Spokespeople for Lowell and Alinor Capital declined to comment. Värde Partners didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The challenging backdrop for debt collectors has also prompted other overly leveraged companies to overhaul their capital structures. Intrum AB, based in Sweden, has also undergone a debt restructuring, while creditor Arrow Global took over iQera Group. --With assistance from Libby Cherry.

Title: In Pursuit of the Bitcoin God

Time Published: 2025-03-17T09:00:04Z

This article was featured in One Great Story, New York’s reading recommendation newsletter. Sign up here to get it nightly. If Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous inventor of Bitcoin, was who I believed him to be, he was not going to acknowledge it. He probably wouldn’t talk to me. And seeing him was going to mean sitting on a plane for 20 hours and driving another eight. But I needed to try to have a conversation with him, and it had to be face-to-face. Nakamoto had disappeared in the spring of 2011. I learned about him that summer, when I wrote one of the first magazine feature articles about Bitcoin, the internet-based currency that operates beyond the control of a government or bank. Twelve years later, Bitcoin’s creator remained unknown and his enormous, multibillion-dollar fortune untouched. The modern history of science supplied no precedent for someone who brought a revolutionary technology into the world without taking credit, or spending a penny of the billions of dollars it earned him. Denied a flesh-and-blood human to venerate, acolytes of Bitcoin had conferred on the pseudonym the halo of legend. In 2022, Kanye West stepped from an Escalade in Beverly Hills wearing a Satoshi Nakamoto baseball hat. In Budapest, adherents unveiled the first statue of Nakamoto, a depiction in bronze of a hooded, spectral figure. A trio of libertarians bought a decommissioned cruise ship, christened it the MS Satoshi, and recruited settlers for the world’s first sovereign Bitcoin-powered society. More than one fellow technologist lobbied for Nakamoto to receive a Nobel Prize. When I first wrote about Nakamoto in 2011, I couldn’t have foreseen that more than a decade later his identity would remain a mystery. Since then, numerous attempts to unmask Nakamoto had failed, sometimes spectacularly. In 2014, Newsweek confidently identified the wrong guy, a California systems engineer whose real name was Dorian Nakamoto, unleashing a media siege of his house that lasted for days. Even 60 Minutes, with untold resources and a deep bench of seasoned investigative journalists, threw up its hands and declared the challenge “mission impossible.” Yet now, against all odds, I believed I had cracked it. I was nervous. This was someone who’d gone to great lengths to be unfindable. And what I’d learned about him was disturbing. He was nothing like how people had imagined Satoshi Nakamoto. He’d repeatedly described himself as dangerous. He had guns. He also owned at least four properties on two continents. I’d initially thought he was hiding out in a remote part of Hawaii’s Big Island, but now, in the summer of 2023, I’d come to believe that he lived in a small beach community on the east coast of Australia. I was fretting about all this when I met my sister for dinner. I told her my anxieties. She’d been a TV-news producer for 20 years and had been onsite in Montana with 48 Hours after the FBI raided the Unabomber’s property and arrested him. She suggested I take professional security people with me. And that I wear a bulletproof vest. And give local police a heads-up. “Thanks,” I mumbled. Later that night, she texted me: “Couldn’t sleep not sure why.” It was 4:09 a.m. “Two thoughts. Maybe doorstep him in a public place if he ever leaves the house. Also might be worth having someone video the encounter (from a safe distance) for evidence.” Eighteen months earlier, on New Year’s Eve 2021, an email had arrived in my inbox. “Subject: New information re Satoshi.” Since writing that early Bitcoin article, I’d periodically receive emails like this. Someone was always shopping a new Satoshi theory. Usually, I paid little heed to these, which tended to rekindle a fleeting hope of learning something fresh before proving unconvincing. This email had no text, but a link led to a blog post titled “I’m the SpaceX Intern Who Speculated Satoshi Is Elon Musk. There Is More to the Story.” The author, Sahil Gupta, had produced a ripple on the internet four years earlier with another post making the case that Musk was “probably” Nakamoto. Now he presented further evidence: an account of an interaction he’d had with Musk’s chief of staff, Sam Teller. It seemed slight and ambiguous, and I didn’t respond. Two days later, I received another email from the same address. This one contained a link to Gupta’s detailed case for Musk as Nakamoto. I didn’t know what to make of his arguments, which ranged from vague to highly technical. Still, I wrote back. Sahil told me that in 2015, when he was an undergraduate at Yale, he’d scored a summer internship writing inventory-management software at the SpaceX rocket factory in Hawthorne, California. Musk was in the office maybe three days a week, and Sahil would see him in the hallways. Sahil was majoring in computer science, and for a senior thesis he proposed a central-bank digital currency called fedcoin in which the U.S. improved the dollar by taking the best aspects of Bitcoin. The paper’s acknowledgments thanked “Satoshi Nakamoto for being a straight up legend.” While researching the thesis, Sahil steeped himself in cryptocurrency literature, starting with the nine-page white paper where Nakamoto first described Bitcoin. Reading the Bitcoin creator’s writing, he was struck by similarities to Musk’s language. Both spoke of “order of magnitude” reasoning and used the word bloody. Nakamoto talked about money in a conceptual way, as Musk had done when he was an executive at PayPal in the early aughts. Musk, like Nakamoto, had a history of programming in the C++ language and was knowledgeable about cryptography. Sahil began to wonder: Might the inventor of Bitcoin have been in front of us all along, hiding in the dazzle of his own celebrity? When Sahil graduated from college, he decided he wanted to work directly for Musk. After emailing Musk several times, he got a phone interview with Teller, his chief of staff. As the call with Teller drew to a close, Sahil took a chance: “Is Elon Satoshi?” “Teller didn’t say anything for 15 seconds,” Sahil told me. “Then he said, ‘Well, what can I say?’” “That was another big clue,” Sahil said. “It’s pretty clear what’s going on. Like, I surprised him. The answer I got is pretty telling.” Later that year, Sahil wrote his “Elon Musk Probably Invented Bitcoin” blog post. He argued that the Bitcoin community, which had been riven by strife over how and whether to mainstream the technology, would benefit from the return of its founder to guide it. A few cryptocurrency blogs picked up Sahil’s theory, and Bloomberg News covered it. For his part, Musk tweeted: “Not true. A friend sent me part of a [bitcoin] a few years [ago], but I don’t know where it is.” As the years passed and he connected more dots, Sahil became even more convinced that Musk was Nakamoto. He noted that Luke Nosek, a cofounder of PayPal, had once said that the company’s original goal was to develop a currency free from banks. Musk, like Nakamoto, had a history of using two spaces after a period in his writing. Musk regularly flew in and out of Van Nuys Airport, which matched up with perhaps the only security lapse Nakamoto had ever made: Early in Bitcoin’s history, an email from Nakamoto to another software developer inadvertently betrayed an IP address in north Los Angeles. Sahil learned that early Bitcoin coders had considered Satoshi “bossy”; Musk was certainly that. In late 2021, Musk had recently been named Time’s Person of the Year. SpaceX had successfully docked a capsule at the International Space Station. Musk had even tweeted playfully about dogecoin, a meme cryptocurrency (it subsequently went parabolic in price, then crashed). Sahil felt that the media might now finally be ready to accept that Nakamoto, who was now seen almost universally as a benevolent genius, and Musk were the same person. Sahil told me he was “99 percent sure” about his theory. He chalked up others’ doubts to prejudice against Musk. Okay, but Musk wasn’t humble, so why would he deny being Bitcoin’s creator? To Sahil, this was evidence of Musk’s savvy. “Unlike a company that needs marketing, Bitcoin was stronger and could grow faster, in the early days, when it had the aura of an anonymous founder.” I didn’t know if Sahil was right, but I could relate to his fixation. Bitcoin had recently hit an all-time high of nearly $70,000 for a single coin, and the market value of all bitcoins in circulation had passed $1 trillion. El Salvador had recognized bitcoin as legal tender. In 2011, it hadn’t seemed like such a big deal that no one knew who Nakamoto was. But how was it possible that even now no one knew? Six months later, I quit my job to devote myself full time to unraveling the mystery that had first beguiled me a decade earlier. On Halloween 2008, someone going by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto had posted a short write-up outlining “a peer-to-peer electronic cash system” on an obscure, moderated email list about cryptography informally known as Metzdowd. That none of its subscribers had heard of Satoshi Nakamoto didn’t strike anyone as odd. Metzdowd was frequented by people devoted to secrecy. They were used to aliases. In his write-up, Nakamoto described a new kind of money. It would run on a network of volunteers’ computers. It would use a transparent public ledger collectively maintained by the network, rather than relying on a bank’s or government’s database of debits and credits. Nakamoto included a link to a more detailed formal description that would come to be known as “the Bitcoin white paper.” A few members of the list gave Nakamoto feedback on the software he was writing, and he gamely welcomed it. “I appreciate your questions,” he told one in an email, adding, “I actually did this kind of backwards. I had to write all the code before I could convince myself that I could solve every problem, then I wrote the paper.” In early January of 2009, Nakamoto released an alpha version of Bitcoin on SourceForge, then a popular site for open-source software projects, which welcome any programmers who want to take part. The first day, according to one early Bitcoiner, 127 people downloaded the Bitcoin software. A lot of the first participants were programmers who thought money was overdue for a product update. Paper bills and coins faded, wrinkled, tore, got dirty, spread germs. They were available only in fixed denominations, could be counterfeited, and were hard to move in any significant quantity. Bitcoin was durable, unforgeable, almost infinitely divisible. It might finally realize the internet commerce dream of microtransactions. You could send any amount of it anywhere instantly. Bitcoin, as a currency based on 0s and 1s in a cloud maintained by far-flung, ordinary individuals, was also immune to meddling by central powers. Unlike bars of gold, bitcoin couldn’t be seized. Unlike a bank account, it couldn’t be frozen. Unlike a national currency, it couldn’t be devalued at the whim of a central bank or subjected to capital controls by a dictator. At the heart of Nakamoto’s creation was something called the blockchain, an ever-lengthening record of all transactions (buy, sell, etc.) that had occurred in the system. Approximately every ten minutes, the latest batch of transaction records were bundled into a “block,” and the block was “chained” onto the block that had preceded it using some clever math that made it impractical for anyone to go back and tamper with the block’s contents. This record, or ledger, which in traditional finance would be maintained by an institution such as a government or bank, was maintained by a network of volunteers’ computers, each of which ran the Bitcoin software and stored constantly updating copies of the ledger. Although Bitcoin was an open-source project — an it-takes-a-village group effort — someone needed to be in charge, and for the first 20 months that was Satoshi Nakamoto. He would release code, other developers would suggest patches, and he would integrate the ones he liked. Four months after Gavin Andresen, a software developer, began contributing programming code to the Bitcoin project, his dedication and computer-science chops seemed to have won Nakamoto’s trust. First, Nakamoto gave Gavin direct access to the source code. Then, around September 2010, Nakamoto told Gavin that he was getting busy with other projects, and over the coming months he would hand over control of both the code repository on SourceForge and the project’s “alert key,” which allowed the broadcasting of urgent messages to all machines running the Bitcoin software. For an open-source project, these were the closest things to a leadership badge; at that point Gavin effectively became the project’s head developer, guiding a team of five other volunteer coders. Over the next few months, Nakamoto continued to chime in occasionally on technical questions, but Gavin’s openness chafed against his reclusive tendencies. After PayPal and Visa froze WikiLeaks’s accounts, a faction of Bitcoiners argued that the cryptocurrency could be helpful to the controversial organization. “Bring it on,” someone wrote on a forum called BitcoinTalk. Nakamoto bristled. “No,” he replied. “Don’t ‘bring it on.’ The project needs to grow gradually so the software can be strengthened along the way. I make this appeal to WikiLeaks not to try to use Bitcoin … The heat you would bring would likely destroy us at this stage.” For journalists covering Bitcoin, Gavin had become the natural person to call first. His mild, reasonable manner and willingness to use his real name made him the Bitcoin ambassador Nakamoto had never been. But Nakamoto seemed to grow uncomfortable with Gavin’s interactions with media. In late April of 2011, Nakamoto emailed Gavin: “I wish you wouldn’t keep talking about me as a mysterious shadowy figure, the press just turns that into a pirate currency angle.” This turned out to be the last time Gavin heard from Nakamoto. When I first spoke with Gavin that July, he said he hadn’t communicated with Nakamoto “in a couple months.” After Gavin told Nakamoto in an email on April 26 that he’d agreed to give a talk on Bitcoin to the crypto-curious CIA at its headquarters in Langley, Virginia, Nakamoto never responded. Around the same date, Nakamoto wrote emails to at least one other programmer who’d worked on the project. Then he went silent. He’s never been heard from again, with the possible exception of a single forum post years later that may or may not have been Nakamoto’s. Gavin and the other early Bitcoin developers agreed on a few things about Satoshi’s identity. The second place Nakamoto had announced his white paper was the website of the P2P Foundation, an idealistic nonprofit dedicated to peer-to-peer networks of all kinds. In his profile on the site, Nakamoto gave his residence as Japan. But no one believed he was Japanese. His English was flawless. He sounded British. In both the Bitcoin source code and his posts to the BitcoinTalk forum, Nakamoto favored Anglo spellings like colour and optimise. Nakamoto guarded his identity closely. When registering the domain bitcoin.org, he had done so through a masking service called anonymousspeech.com, which itself had been registered from a temporary-housing broker in Tokyo. That service gave him an email address at vistomail.com, which offered the option of manipulating the date and time an email was sent. A third email address Nakamoto used was from gmx.com, another free webmail provider. In communication, Nakamoto expressed himself with a practiced opacity. He’d answer technical questions but would ignore attempts to draw him out on personal matters. Nakamoto’s programming style was a bit dated, suggesting he might be on the older side. He used something called Hungarian notation, a convention of variable naming popular among Windows programmers in the 1990s. Gavin had the impression that the Bitcoin code had been written by a small group or even just one person. When programmers collaborate, they tend to insert regular comments in their code, telling one another what this or that block of instructions is supposed to accomplish. The Bitcoin software contained few of these. Others felt that Bitcoin worked too smoothly from the moment it launched to be the product of a single brain. And the white paper used “we,” which suggested Satoshi Nakamoto must be the catch-all for a group of people or an institution. Even before Nakamoto evaporated, he was coming to be revered. On April 16, 2011, a BitcoinTalker named Wobber pointed out how varied Nakamoto’s expertise was, and how unusual his behavior — to come up with something so innovative, not take credit for it or exploit his stature, and leave without telling anyone. Someone likened Nakamoto to Zorro or a masked David who’d aimed his slingshot at the Goliath of banks and governments. Might the name itself contain a clue? Satoshi Nakamoto, roughly translated from Japanese, could mean “central intelligence.” Perhaps this pointed to the role of spies in Bitcoin’s creation. Maybe the National Security Agency was playing a long game, launching an off-the-books financial network it could use either to pay assets in the field, anywhere in the world, or as a honeypot where adversaries would transact with a false sense of security while the spooks at Fort Meade monitored their every move. It wasn’t a totally crazy idea. The U.S. Naval Research Laboratory had birthed the Onion Router, the anonymizing software known as TOR that enabled the dark web. The FBI would later secretly create its own line of encrypted phones and a messaging service, ANOM, that were unwittingly adopted by organized criminals, resulting in more than 800 arrests. And in the summer of 1996, researchers in the Cryptology Division of the NSA’s Office of Information Security Research and Technology had internally published a paper, later made public, titled “How to Make a Mint: The Cryptography of Anonymous Electronic Cash.” You could also read Nakamoto’s name as a portmanteau of big tech-company names — SAmsung, TOSHIba, NAKAmichi, MOTOrola — so maybe a corporate cabal was behind it. Redditors pooled their deciphering skills, also finding Satoshi Nakamoto to be an anagram of, among other phrases, “Ma, I took NSA’s oath” and “So a man took a shit.” Dan Kaminsky, who’d shot to prominence as a young programmer in 2008 when he discovered a technical glitch that could have undermined the entire internet, thought Nakamoto might be a group at a bank. “I suspect Satoshi is a small team at a financial institution,” Dan told me. “I just get that feeling.” But Kaminsky added that he didn’t think that Satoshi’s identity “is that critical to what Bitcoin is. Bitcoin is larger than Satoshi.” This jibed with a sentiment I’d heard voiced more than once: The whole idea of Nakamoto as an unknown pseudonymous entity who’d dematerialized was an integral part of Bitcoin’s design. At the Bitcoin 2022 conference in Miami, Satoshi Nakamoto was, in absentia, everywhere. The Nakamoto Stage, where the keynotes and most important panels took place, was flanked by illuminated screens featuring a rotating display of snippets from his writings. They had the Dianetics-like quality of being banal to outsiders and profound to insiders. Imagine if gold turned to lead when stolen. I’m sure that in twenty years there will either be very large Bitcoin transaction volume … or no volume. The network is robust in its unstructured simplicity. Peter Thiel, the PayPal founder turned venture capitalist, emerged stage right and threw a wad of hundred-dollar bills into the front rows: “It’s kind of crazy that this stuff still works, you know?” Bitcoin was a warning, he said, that the fiat system was over. What stood in the way of the crypto revolution, Thiel said, were “the enemies of this movement,” among whom he enumerated Warren Buffett, JPMorganChase CEO Jamie Dimon, and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. Thiel told the crowd that the enemies he’d named were “extensions of the state.” Bitcoin, by contrast, wasn’t a company and had no board. “We do not know who Satoshi is,” Thiel added for emphasis. We do not know who Satoshi is. Back in 2011, he’d been the no-name coder of an experimental money that was of interest mainly to a fringe community. Ten years later, he was the mythic founder of a project with a $1 trillion market capitalization, making it the ninth-most-valuable asset in the world, just below Tesla and above Meta. Whoever Nakamoto was, he was fantastically rich. Through some clever analysis of the early blockchain, a computer scientist named Sergio Demian Lerner had estimated that, at the time, Nakamoto held some $40 billion worth of bitcoin (today the figure is much higher). Nakamoto was by far the largest holder of the currency. When the crypto exchange Coinbase went public in the spring of 2021, one of the risk factors listed in the prospectus the company filed with the SEC was the public identification of Nakamoto. It wasn’t hard to think of scenarios where who Nakamoto was — and what his motives and intentions were — might be relevant. In the Bitcoin realm, the Nakamoto mystery was coming to be seen as necessary — a feature rather than a bug. To be truly decentralized required that Bitcoin have a virgin birth. Depriving it of a human figurehead, a flawed individual with a particular identity that might be palatable to one group but not to another, gave it the best shot at being taken up en masse. And so the Nakamoto alias had come to be hallowed. While some people conjectured that the Bitcoin creator had gone to ground mainly for his own protection, lest he be prosecuted for tax evasion or physically attacked for his coin stash, the common view was that he’d acted selflessly. The most zealous Bitcoiners treated inquiries into Nakamoto’s identity as a sort of blasphemy, as if they were Scientologists being asked about Xenu. In the summer of 2022, I tacked a spreadsheet of the hundred-plus candidates who’d ever been proposed as Satoshi Nakamoto onto my office wall. Most of the leading candidates were cypherpunks whose names had been floated as possible Satoshis many times over the years. There were more obscure names from adjacent fields like math, cryptography, and economics. Some were programmers involved early on with the Bitcoin software project. Others were creators of newer cryptocurrencies. Many were just Famous Smart People: Bill Gates. Steve Jobs. Musk. For a number of years, the consensus leading candidates have generally been considered to be Nick Szabo, Adam Back, and Hal Finney. Szabo, a programmer who had advocated for decentralized money years before Bitcoin appeared, had conceived a kind of Bitcoin precursor called “Bit Gold” in the late nineties. He had the necessary technical skills, and there were superficial similarities between his writing style and Nakamoto’s. But he has always denied being Satoshi, and no definitive evidence linking him to Nakamoto or to Bitcoin’s early development has ever been produced. Adam Back’s name was mentioned in the Bitcoin white paper as the creator of another cryptocurrency precursor, Hashcash, and his email address is one of the first to have been contacted by Nakamoto. He, too, denies being Nakamoto, and his writing style matches up less closely than Szabo’s. Hal Finney, a legendary programmer and cryptographer, received the first-ever Bitcoin transaction from Nakamoto. But Finney, who also denied being Satoshi, was diagnosed with ALS in 2009, declining rapidly to the point where he was physically incapacitated. If ever Satoshi were to be unmasked, Finney is the most hoped-for candidate among Bitcoiners because of his tragic-heroic story and his general aura of kindly benevolence — and also because, being conveniently deceased (he died in 2014), he can’t create unsavory press with unsavory behavior or associations. There had always been the faction hostile to inquiry about Nakamoto’s identity. Last fall, when an HBO documentary posited that a libertarian Canadian computer programmer and crypto enthusiast named Peter Todd was the most likely candidate, the Bitcoin community reacted not just with strong skepticism about the documentary’s conclusion but with anger that such a project had even been undertaken. He has made a valuable contribution, so his wishes for anonymity should be honored. What matters is not the person but the idea, the code. But Nakamoto had plunked his gizmo in the public square, so I felt it was reasonable to inquire who’d put it there and why. I combed through the 60,000 words Satoshi Nakamoto had left behind. He wrote in a plain style, rarely opining or showing personality. Whenever I found the slightest hint of individual style, I’d add it to a list of Nakamoto-isms, which eventually included more than 200 words and phrases. Wet blanket. Sweet. Clobbering. I wrote a computer program, the Satoshitizer, which trawled through the archived writings of various suspects, scanning for Nakamoto-isms and generating tables of statistics. I could instantly rank an archive using more than a dozen criteria, including users of Nakamoto-isms, users of e-cash terminology, and discussers of software tools employed by Nakamoto. One day in late April 2023, I found myself thinking about a word I’d seen in Nakamoto’s writings: hosed. Given Nakamoto’s tendency to write in a style stripped of personality or association with any particular milieu, hosed stood out. I hadn’t recently heard the word, in its sense of screwed or wrecked, and vaguely associated it with turn-of-the-1990s surfing or fraternity lingo. I went back through my scraped archives and noted each time someone used the word. I looked at Metzdowd. In the three years leading up to October 31, 2008, when Nakamoto first announced Bitcoin there, the word had been used four times. Twice it was by the same person: James A. Donald. Though Donald hadn’t played much of a role in the public discussion of Bitcoin, he’d had a cameo in its early history as the first person on the discussion list to respond to Nakamoto. Donald’s response had been a technical criticism related to Bitcoin’s scaling potential, and after a few exchanges with Nakamoto he’d dropped out of the conversation. He was just one of many cypherpunks who’d been interested in digital money. At that point, Donald was only No. 42 on my Suspects spreadsheet, far below the consensus leading candidates and on the list at all primarily because he was a cypherpunk and libertarian who had coded in C++. But intrigued by the “hosed” coincidence, I went back and looked at the lists of rare words the Satoshitizer had compiled. I wanted to see whether Donald had used any other rare Nakamoto-isms. He had. Donald showed up as the only person on any of the two decades’ worth of lists I’d scraped who had ever used the word fencible — in the sense of stolen goods “able to be fenced.” This was a word Nakamoto had used once, in the expression non-fencible. And it appeared in a post by Donald on the cypherpunks list in October of 1998. My brain started pinging. The verb fence was common enough slang, but the adjective fencible was an oddity. A Google search turned up hardly any instances on the internet. When I queried the archives of the daily New York Times, which went back to 1857 and included more than 13 million articles, fencible, in the sense I was interested in, hadn’t appeared once. Unlike, say, trusted third party or zero-knowledge proofs, which are unexceptional in conversations among digital-cash or crypto experts, fencible and hosed weren’t words unique to cryptography or even to computer science. They were more revealing of someone’s voice. I began looking more closely at Donald. He had a slippery internet presence. Websites variously declared that he was Canadian, that he had died, and that “James A. Donald” wasn’t his real name. In his posts, he almost never revealed personal details, but a few were strewn here and there. He was Australian but had lived in Silicon Valley for many years. Like Nakamoto, he sometimes used American spellings and other times used Commonwealth spellings. Ideologically, Donald had fused a libertarianism so extreme that it was really anarcho-capitalism with a fervent conviction in the world-changing power of cryptography. “So guys, that is the plan,” he wrote in 1996. “We destroy the state through higher mathematics. We do this by replacing the current institutional mechanisms of corporations with cryptographic mechanisms. This will give more people the opportunity to evade and resist taxes.” He had a particular interest in digital money. “Eventually people will bypass the banks, directly transferring funds to each other,” he wrote in 1995. On Metzdowd, between 2006 and 2009, Donald employed more of the e-cash vocabulary Nakamoto used than any other poster. I examined Donald’s programming style. In the late 1990s, he’d promoted a piece of communications encryption software called Crypto Kong. He’d written it in C++, the language Nakamoto used for Bitcoin. Using the Wayback Machine, I found an archived copy of the source code. Crypto Kong bore other similarities to Bitcoin. Like Nakamoto, Donald had coded the software for Windows and, more esoterically, used the Hungarian notation that Nakamoto did. Like Nakamoto, Donald used sweeping lines of slashes to separate sections of code. Like Bitcoin, Crypto Kong used elliptic curve cryptography to generate private-public key pairs. I gleaned more information about Donald. He was born in 1952, so was now over 70 — fitting the profile of an older programmer that various early Bitcoin developers had noted Nakamoto’s coding style suggested. Donald wasn’t on Twitter or Facebook or LinkedIn, at least under his own name. His $2.8 million Palo Alto house was blurred on Google Street View, as was his $400,000 Austin house. This was an option you could exercise only by submitting a formal request to Google (or perhaps by working at Google, as one of Donald’s two sons had). There were no easily found photographs of him. Like Nakamoto, Donald used a privacy-focused email provider, Switzerland-based Proton Mail. He had a blog titled Jim’s Blog, untethered from his last name. He had spent, he’d told the blog’s readers, “a lot of time off the grid.” Click-click-click. The tumblers were falling into place. I now began to think about the significance of Donald’s response to Nakamoto being the first. I pictured Nakamoto in 2008: He’d just launched his work of genius into the world and … crickets. So he decided to both nudge things along (while also creating a useful misdirection) by lobbing a criticism at himself. Jim’s Blog revealed a few more clues. In the run-up to October 31, 2008, Donald had been focused on the financial crisis. His post on October 11, titled “The Cause of the Crisis,” began: “The bailout will fail.” This was notable because the London Times headline embedded in the Bitcoin Genesis block, the first block in the chain produced by Satoshi, had been “Chancellor on Brink of Second Bailout.” I found further coincidences. Donald owned several pieces of property in Hawaii. On June 19, 2008, a few months before Satoshi Nakamoto began communicating with the world about his invention, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser had run an obituary for “Satoshi Nakamoto,” a veteran of World War II who’d died at 84. Could Donald have lifted the name when casting about for a pseudonym? Though “Jim” rarely mentioned any details that betrayed his identity or location, he revealed things about his beliefs in various posts. Before he was a libertarian or crypto-anarchist, he’d been a radical leftist. At age 15, he’d joined the Spartacists, a faction of Trotskyites, but “I became disillusioned with the sparts, and disillusioned by participatory democracy—and none too keen on representative democracy either.” At 17, he joined two other radical groups, the anarcho-socialists and the Maoists, “mostly because these were the two groups most hated by the trots.” Eventually he concluded that freedom lay in property rights, and he became an anarcho-capitalist. I spoke with people who’d known him when he was a graduate student in the School of Physics at the University of Sydney. Bob Hewitt, who was on the department faculty, interviewed Donald as part of the application process. Donald had come from Melbourne, and Bob recalled him as “bohemian”; asked whether he’d arranged for a place to stay in Sydney, Donald said he’d sleep under a bridge. He was “a friendly kind of guy,” Hewitt said, “just strange.” Donald never completed the Ph.D. program. Every student was supposed to give a colloquium, but “no one understood what he was saying,” Hewitt recalled. “We couldn’t say he was brilliant, but he was certainly incomprehensible when he tried to explain his paper.” Donald ended up dropping out after his dissertation, “Assumptions of the Singularity Theorems and the Rejuvenation of Universes,” was rejected.He started writing software for Apple computers, then moved to the U.S. and programmed video games for Epyx. Later, he worked at database companies. Poring over Jim’s Blog, I saw that Donald had an authoritative understanding of Bitcoin and its vulnerabilities; he clearly took a long, historical view of it as a stepping stone toward a particular future he wanted. Bitcoin, he wrote, “is a prototype that is prematurely being used as the final system.” I’d never shared the presumption, prevalent in the Bitcoin world, that Nakamoto must be a benign figure. I’d always felt that the Bitcoiners who elevated Nakamoto to semi-divine status were indulging in wishful projection: that he was selfless. That he was humble. That he had come from the future to exalt humanity. Hal Finney had made for a particularly appealing Satoshi Nakamoto because he lived up to that image. Donald did not. On his blog, Donald espoused a dark ideology called neoreaction that had beguiled certain people in Silicon Valley. Neoreactionaries believed that society had been hijacked by what they called the Cathedral — academic and media and bureaucratic elites. They disdained efforts to achieve social justice. The best way forward, they argued, was to jettison democracy and restore a monarchy. Donald’s particular flavor of neoreaction also incorporated an overtly Christian element and a generous dose of paranoia; he attributed the COVID pandemic to a Jesuit conspiracy. Along with his baroque politics, Donald produced a regular feed of racist, homophobic, and misogynist opinions and offensive language. He was so abrasive that, in 2014, even Slate Star Codex, an influential Silicon Valley blog with a history of tolerating discussion of taboo subjects like IQ science, had banned him. But on his blog, hosted on a relatively uncensorable domain in Laos, he advocated “whipping a woman on the buttocks or upper back” to keep her in line and argued that “very few rape accusations are true.” Donald had a substantial following in the red-pilled, alt-right blogosphere. If Donald was Nakamoto, wasn’t it obvious why he’d chosen a pseudonym when launching Bitcoin? He wanted his work of genius to be taken on its own terms rather than dismissed because it was his. He had hidden not because Bitcoin could be a risk to him but because he could be a risk to Bitcoin. I wondered whether there were crypto people who knew or suspected that Donald was Nakamoto. If Nakamoto were a harmless private citizen like Dorian Nakamoto, “Satoshi deserves his privacy” would be at least a reasonable position to take. If Nakamoto were a dissident living under an autocratic regime, I’d want to protect his secret too. But if Nakamoto were Donald? It would undermine the narrative of Bitcoin’s inventor as a crypto Christ who’d passed up fame and treasure for the sake of a higher good. Was it possible that some of the Satoshi-deserves-his-privacy people, recognizing that it would be a PR calamity for Bitcoin to have been invented by a far-right whackjob, were really just safeguarding the reputation of their religion and the value of their investments? In June 2020, the HashCash founder Adam Back, himself long suspected by some of being Satoshi, had tweeted: “Maybe we should get mentally prepared to disown Satoshi. Nuke the nym from orbit, just to be safe.” “Satoshi’s identity doesn’t matter,” Ray Dillinger, who along with Hal Finney had done code review for Nakamoto before Bitcoin’s launch, wrote. “The protocol is what it is. If it’s a third-world dictator, a homeless guy living under a bridge in Belize, a Bedouin working from a cell phone as she traverses Bir Tawil on a camel, or a pushcart vendor in Nairobi, the protocol is exactly the same as it would be if it were a cryptanalyst working for the NSA or someone at a ‘troll farm’ drawing a salary from the GRU, or a well-known Security researcher or Cypherpunk. ‘Satoshi’ doesn’t exist outside that protocol. Satoshi is just a hat somebody wore while they were developing it. And it doesn’t matter who was wearing the hat.” I wrote to Jim Donald asking for an interview. Several days later, to my surprise, I heard back from him. “Email discussion would be convenient,” Donald wrote, but he might be able to talk over phone or video. He’d have to let me know in a few days. Two months later, Donald still hadn’t made himself available for a live conversation. Should I travel all the way to Australia to find him in person? One thing that gave me pause about Donald as Nakamoto was that Nakamoto, in his communications, displayed a recognizable range of emotion. He could be appreciative (“Many thanks”), compassionate (“poor thing”), humble (“my apologies”), and modest (“I’m better with code than with words”). I scrolled through years of Jim’s writings, squinting for a trace of empathy or gratitude or enthusiasm, hoping to see an exclamation point, or an apology, or a moment of sympathy or fellowship. Instead, I saw only flatness. But of all the cypherpunks preoccupied with digital cash, only one had ever said they knew Satoshi’s identity. “I know who Nakamoto was,” James Donald had written in a comment on a comment on a post on Jim’s Blog, “and what his political and social goals were.” If true, this would make him the only person on record who credibly possessed this knowledge. I decided I needed to see him. Though Donald had spent most of his career in California, he clearly owned or had owned a house in Australia. Looking through real-estate assessment records for his various U.S. properties, I’d found that for a couple of years in the aughts, a house he owned in Austin was registered to him at a street address on the northeastern coast of Australia. In more recent assessments, the U.S. properties were registered to him in the same Australian town, though now only a PO box was given. I knew his wife had died in 2016, and using the Find a Grave site, I found a photograph from the Australian town’s cemetery of a plaque memorializing her. Five years later, he’d posted a small photo on his blog of what appeared to be the view from his deck: In the foreground was a small glass and a jug of what he described as homemade moonshine. In the distance was a gleaming blue sea, the horizon disrupted by a couple of small islands. I compared this view with other ocean-view images taken from the same town, and they seemed to match. I found a private investigator, Daniel Quinn, who lived within a reasonable drive of the seaside town where I suspected Donald was. I sent Quinn the house address and a 20-year-old photo of Donald I’d found on an abandoned college blog of one of his sons. A few days later, Daniel sent me a surveillance report. “The yard is in a very unkempt state with very long grass and overgrown shrubbery and trees, he’s definitely not a plant lover.” He attached a photo of James’s house and the patchy driveway it shared with two other homes. There was a lonely palm tree near the curb, and up the hill was a bungalow on stilts, set amid the overgrowth, with a deck looking out at the Coral Sea. Daniel didn’t see James that day, but several weeks later, I awoke to a message: Daniel had managed to get a photo of a man standing in the house’s doorway. He was a clear 20-years-older match to the man in the photo I’d sent. Same dense beard, though now it was white. Similar large metal-rim glasses. Same fleshy nose. Three days later, I was on a plane to Australia. There was a screen door and no doorbell, so I knocked on James’s doorframe. My mouth was dry from nerves. While I wasn’t convinced that James himself was necessarily Nakamoto, I thought he might have been part of Nakamoto. In any case, he was the sole remaining person I knew of who claimed to know who Nakamoto was. I worried about how he’d receive me. James had gone out of his way to be unfindable. Crossing his porch toward the front door, I could see Donald sitting at a computer in the living room and wearing headphones. His latest blog post, put up just a few hours earlier, was a rambling screed about how Georgians (as in the country of Georgia) don’t want “their Churches destroyed or turned into shrines of Gaia and gay sex, their old and beautiful buildings bulldozed and replaced by demonic postmodern eyesores.” Western NGOs were working to see “Georgia faggotized and thrown into the meat grinder against Russia.” When he didn’t respond to my knock on the doorframe, I knocked directly on the front door. A moment later James opened it and stepped outside in black long johns and a red camouflage long-sleeved shirt. I started talking. I’d sent him an email and — “Oh, I’m rather sporadic at reading my emails,” James said. I reminded him of our exchange the prior year and of the book I was writing. “Ah, right,” James said. I said something about how I’d have been remiss if I didn’t make every effort to speak with him. “Okay,” James said. “Well, the short of it is that I can’t even tell you what I don’t tell you.” His tone was pleasant, bemused. I pointed out that he’d publicly insisted he knew who Nakamoto was and what his social and political goals were. Could he elaborate? “No, sorry.” “Okay … Do you really know? Or do you sort of think you have a strong idea of who it might be?” “I have a very good idea of who it might be, but I don’t actually, uh, no.” “Do you think it was Hal Finney?” “I can’t answer that.” “Is that just because you’re respecting his privacy?” “I’m not allowed to tell anyone anything, and I’m not allowed to tell people what I’ve already told ’em.” Could I buy him a beer while I was in town? “Ah,” James said. “In wine there is truth. And I’m obligated not to tell people the truth.” “Lunch?” I offered. James laughed. “Look,” he said. “I have a tendency to talk too much, and I have a big tendency to talk too much after a few drinks, so I’m sorry.” I tried to keep the conversation going — giving him my contact information along with a previous book I’d written — but his answers became monosyllabic. “Well, I can understand why you’d live here,” I said, gesturing at his stunning view. “Yeah,” James said, looking down. I thanked him and made my way back down the hill. I’d spent 15 years trying to identify Satoshi. In pursuit of this quest, I’d learned to code, recruited a machine-learning expert and a stylometry specialist and a private investigator, and made a 37-hour journey for a three-minute encounter. I was pretty sure no one had spent as much time as I had in trying to solve this. I was starting to feel a kinship with Sahil Gupta, who couldn’t be persuaded that Nakamoto was anyone other than Elon Musk. At some point, I needed to stop. Perhaps someday AI will allow us to definitively identify Satoshi. But I am now convinced that, barring some unpredictable declassification of a government secret, we will likely never know beyond a reasonable doubt who he was. Memories fade. People die. There is no paternity test for Bitcoin, no way to prove who Nakamoto is unless he comes forward and demonstrates that he has the relevant private keys, or at least non-forged contemporaneous documents supporting his story. As years pass, the trail, if there was one, grows fainter. I felt some relief in accepting this. I remained dazzled by the achievement of Nakamoto’s invention — but almost equally by the perfection of his vanishing. As a utopian project, Bitcoin had never stood a chance. But as a new asset class, it has proved resilient. Its price continues to rise and fall, and rise again, reaching a new all-time high above $109,000 in January. (As of this writing, it’s at $85,000.) Fidelity now advises retail clients to allocate a small portion of their investment portfolios to cryptocurrency. The spread of blockchain technology feels inevitable. Satoshi Nakamoto was something that whoever was behind the pseudonym could never be — an idea that, without a body or a history to drag it down, would live forever.

Title: Covid Redux: The Bird Flu Scare

Full Content:
The World Health Organization (WHO) has been sounding the alarm on a bird flu pandemic in 2025, and the plandemic — for that is what it is — is well upon us. Caused by the H5N1 virus, bird flu has been transmitted to humans, killing more than half of those infected — 460 out of 950 cases — in the past 22 years. Transmission between humans hasn’t occurred so far, but the prospects are alarming. While mutations or interaction with other viruses could certainly wreak havoc, the fear could be used — as in the 2020–21 Covid pandemic — to force people to isolate, get vaccinated, and remain under surveillance. And that is exactly what some experts fear is happening — a Covid redux, with the same playbook in operation. Only, this time, a slightly different approach is being taken. Instead of directly targeting humans, our food is the focus for the creation and mandating of ineffective vaccines. It’s a plausible scenario, considering how the authorities and the WHO have been ratcheting up the fear. In 2024, there were 81 cases of bird flu in humans, with 66 of those cases in the U.S. In 2025, so far there are three cases in the U.S., and one fatality (from Louisiana). Egg prices are skyrocketing — over $8 a dozen in some parts of the country — and more than 166 million wild and domestic fowl have died of the flu or been culled since 2022. During the last quarter alone 20 million chickens have died or been culled. Last week, Harvard Medical School put out a warning quoting Dr. Jacob Lemieux, an infectious diseases expert at Massachusetts General Hospital, as saying, “I think we are living next to a volcano, and it may erupt or it may not. But we need to prepare for the possibility of a pandemic.” But Dr. Clayton J. Baker of the Brownstone Institute, an internist and former professor of medical humanities and bioethics at the University of Rochester, believes the crisis is artificial. He says it has been created by so-called pandemic experts who are “actively seeking to perpetuate it.” Baker goes so far as to say that the bird flu virus was bioengineered for transmission across animal species and made potent to be able to infect humans. Meanwhile, technologies were developed and patented for making vaccines against this bioweapon. Baker alleges that one of the labs where reckless gain-of-function has been conducted for decades, with multiple lab leaks, is the Kawaoka bird flu lab at the University of Wisconsin. According to him, in 2022, a strategic leak of the virus was arranged — from USDA Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Georgia, and other laboratories in the U.S. and abroad. As PCR (polymerase chain reaction) testing for bird flu turns up many false positives, causing alarm, the media dials it up further, allowing globalist agents in the government to use the fear factor to force the use of vaccines in the food supply chain. “This is not conspiracy theory,” Baker writes. “This is basic pattern recognition.” He calls for shutting down and investigating the Southeast Poultry Research and Kawaoka labs. The best course for preventing a real outbreak — as opposed to an engineered one — is to stop culling the flocks and allow them to develop immunity. Dr. Peter McCullough, a cardiologist who championed alternative treatments during the Covid scare, echoes Baker’s suspicions, particularly those of a vaccine cartel at work. On February 16, he tweeted: “(The) vaccine cartel gets closer to realizing its dream of vaccinating 308 million egg-laying hens in the U.S., even though leaky vaccines are likely to result in new pathogens.” He says poultry vaccination has failed miserably in China and southeast Asia for decades because it breeds resistant strains and increases transmission to other animals. The U.S., he believes, is making the same mistake. According to McCullough, culling and the compensatory payouts to poultry farms — some $1.25 billion so far — have created a “perverse profit incentive.” Instead of stopping the spread, culling, he says, has led to the transmission of the virus to humans. He cites a New England Journal of Medicine study that found almost all human cases linked to such efforts. The connection to the agents of the Great Reset is evident. In an interview, McCullough says, GAVI, the global vaccine alliance, which is part of this bio-pharmaceutical alliance I’ve written about, said in 2021 that bird flu is the next disease X. And now the World Economic Forum (WEF), WHO, and CEPI (Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness) – all have bird flu positioned as disease X. Like Baker, he alleges that the strain causing the current bird flu outbreak was gain-of-functioned. The Trump administration, first and foremost, needs to have all the gain-of-function and lab leak allegations investigated. Besides the Southeast Poultry Research and Kawaoka labs, many military laboratories need to be investigated for infiltration by the People’s Liberation Army (PLA). The suspicion may seem unfounded, but Col. Lawrence Sellin, an Afghanistan veteran and PhD in physiology who has worked with the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), believes PLA infiltration of American medical research has been going on since the 1990s, with a steady trickle of PLA-trained scientists arriving to study or work at American universities. He alleges that the army’s Fort Detrick, Maryland, lab, where he spent four years, has long been a PLA target. He says Chinese researchers at the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Maryland, have worked with the virology division of USAMRIID and Dr Anthony Fauci’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), dealing with dangerous pathogens which are part of China’s biowarfare program. These scientists, he alleges, have even received funds for collaborative research with PLA labs. The second major step the Trump administration needs to take is to disband the White House Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR), something the president had vowed to do as a candidate in April 2024, if elected. As Baker puts it: “Mr. Trump’s instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now.” The OPPR, created by Congress in 2022, advises the president on pandemics and other emergencies. On February 6, Trump nominated Col. Gerald Parker, a champion of Covid vaccines and gain-of-function research, as its director. Parker is a staunch advocate of One Health, and as someone who has spoken of strengthening the WHO, his views align with the globalist elite who are pushing for a Great Reset. Under the Biden administration, he was charged with crafting recommendations for rules governing research that could create riskier pathogens. He also headed the USAMRIID’s Fort Detrick labs, which Col. Sellin alleges has been compromised by PLA infiltration. Trump’s appointment of Col. Parker to the OPPR is at odds with both his promise to disband OPPR and to withdraw from the WHO. The third major step the Trump administration needs to take is to thwart the attempts of the vaccine lobby to profit from the bird flu scare. The risk with such vaccines is that they allow the virus to replicate in the vaccinated hosts and develop immunity, as well as to gain the ability to infect humans. Field tests of such vaccines may already have caused resistant viruses to enter the food chain. Former president Joe Biden had issued a $590 million contract to Moderna for developing a bird flu vaccine. Baker is convinced this should be cancelled, as should the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s conditional approval of a bird flu vaccine developed by Zoetis, the world’s largest producer of medication and vaccines for pets and livestock. The company, as might be expected, is linked to the usual Great Reset suspects — Pfizer, BlackRock, the Gates Foundation. Similar conditional approval is awaited on a bird flu vaccine for cattle, created by Medgene. McCullough calls the bird flu scare “a six-sigma event.” In real terms, it could devastate our food supply and cause mass starvation. With the Covid-19 conspiracy and its objectives coming to light, it’s time for us to oppose this dangerous iteration and say: “We will not comply!” Image: Free image, Pixabay license. The World Health Organization (WHO) has been sounding the alarm on a bird flu pandemic in 2025, and the plandemic — for that is what it is — is well upon us. Caused by the H5N1 virus, bird flu has been transmitted to humans, killing more than half of those infected — 460 out of 950 cases — in the past 22 years. Transmission between humans hasn’t occurred so far, but the prospects are alarming. While mutations or interaction with other viruses could certainly wreak havoc, the fear could be used — as in the 2020–21 Covid pandemic — to force people to isolate, get vaccinated, and remain under surveillance. And that is exactly what some experts fear is happening — a Covid redux, with the same playbook in operation. Only, this time, a slightly different approach is being taken. Instead of directly targeting humans, our food is the focus for the creation and mandating of ineffective vaccines. It’s a plausible scenario, considering how the authorities and the WHO have been ratcheting up the fear. In 2024, there were 81 cases of bird flu in humans, with 66 of those cases in the U.S. In 2025, so far there are three cases in the U.S., and one fatality (from Louisiana). Egg prices are skyrocketing — over $8 a dozen in some parts of the country — and more than 166 million wild and domestic fowl have died of the flu or been culled since 2022. During the last quarter alone 20 million chickens have died or been culled. Last week, Harvard Medical School put out a warning quoting Dr. Jacob Lemieux, an infectious diseases expert at Massachusetts General Hospital, as saying, “I think we are living next to a volcano, and it may erupt or it may not.

Title: China Ramps Up Criticism Of BlackRock Ports Deal

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. A cargo ship sails through the Panama Canal next to the entrance of the Balboa Port, in Panama City, Panama, March 13, 2025. REUTERS/Enea Lebrun By Angus Whitley Mar 16, 2025 (Bloomberg) – Chinese authorities increased pressure on CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. over its plan to sell its Panama ports stake by sharing a second newspaper commentary attacking the deal. The Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office on Saturday reposted a commentary originally published in Ta Kung Pao, saying the planned sale of the ports by the Hong Kong company had triggered deep concerns among Chinese people and questioned whether the deal was harming China and aiding evil. “Why were so many important ports transferred to ill-intentioned US forces so easily? What kind of political calculations are hidden in the so-called commercial behavior on the surface? Great entrepreneurs are never cold-blooded and speculating profit-seekers, but passionate and proud patriots!” said the opinion piece in the newspaper, a publication that tends to support Beijing’s policies. The Chinese government agency, the country’s top office on Hong Kong affairs, first indicated its displeasure over the transaction last week by sharing an earlier Ta Kung Pao commentary. That post drove CK Hutchison shares down 6.4% on Friday, their biggest decline since 2020. The conglomerate founded by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing, this month agreed to sell off the bulk of its global ports business to a consortium led by BlackRock Inc. The sale included a controlling share in ports near the Panama Canal, an apparent victory for US President Donald Trump after he had raised concerns about their ownership. The first Ta Kung Pao commentary called on companies to be careful about which “side they should stand on.” It said social media users had accused CK Hutchison of “spineless groveling” and “selling out” Chinese people. Under the agreement, CK Hutchison will sell 43 ports in 23 countries, while keeping facilities in mainland China and Hong Kong. The transaction is set to generate cash proceeds of more than $19 billion. Because the deal involves only overseas assets it is unlikely to need Beijing’s sign-off, but the recent attacks have stoked concern that China might somehow try to intervene. The fresh opinion piece lauded the “heroic actions” of Ren Zhengfei, founder of Huawei Technologies Co., a Chinese phone and device manufacturer that has long been targeted on national security grounds by the US and other Western nations. “Both history and reality remind entrepreneurs at the forefront of the storm that in the face of the U.S.’s bullying, only by standing firmly with the country and fighting bravely can they defend their country, win dignity and maintain their reputation,” the commentary said. Those who choose to do the opposite, it said, may “make a lot of money for a while, but in the end they will have no future and will bear history’s blame.” Calls and an email sent to CK Hutchison offices in Hong Kong went unanswered outside of office hours on Sunday. The apparent expression of disapproval by Chinese authorities underscores the balancing act facing executives whose companies get caught up in the widening China-US rivalry. CK Hutchison and sister company CK Asset Holdings Ltd. are registered in the Cayman Islands — a move carried out in 2015 as part of a group-wide restructuring. CK Hutchison accrues almost 90% of its revenue from outside of mainland China and Hong Kong. The potential purchase by BlackRock would be one of the biggest acquisitions of the year. Before the agreement, Trump argued that China had taken over the critical waterway, without providing evidence, and that the US was paying too much for the passage of ships. He previously demanded the fees charged on US naval and merchant ships be lowered, or else Panama should return the canal to the US. © 2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: How Vently became San Francisco’s top event party planner
URL: https://sfstandard.com/2025/03/16/vently-event-startup-takes-over-san-francisco/
Time Published: 2025-03-16T16:18:22Z

When Nicolas Khonaysser, 26, moved back to the Bay Area after graduate school in 2024, he was thrown by how unfamiliar the city felt. He’s been in Walnut Creek since age 10, when his family relocated from France. As a teenager, he’d felt connected to the Bay’s thriving social scene. But after grad school, things felt different. “It was fragmented,” he said “You needed 10 different apps to know what was happening. And even then, you’d miss out on something cool.” He felt lonely. And he wasn’t alone. Data analysis from the Chronicle shows that 20-somethings are the largest demographic leaving San Francisco, with some citing a lack of connection as the reason. Jacob Wells, Khonaysser’s friend from Arizona State University, and some of his new connections felt similarly. Last May, they decided to take action, renting a six-bedroom house above a bar in the Excelsior. For Khonaysser and the others — five men and one woman — the house became a home, party venue, and the headquarters for their business, an events startup called Vently, which throws parties and lists events throughout the city. Khonaysser is the CEO. The goal? To help Gen Z, and everyone else, have fun again. And to make money by being Gen Z’s go-to events platform while they’re at it. The competition is stiff: Vently is up against legacy platforms like Eventbrite and Facebook Events, as well as newer players Posh, Lu.ma, and Partiful, which have collectively raised more than $50 million. Vently’s $500,000 in seed funding is comparatively pennies, but its party-forward, fun-centric brand has struck a chord with San Francisco’s dwindling 20-somethings, and the founders are hoping they can bring the city’s youthful energy back to life. Everything you need to know to start your day. When the friends moved into Vently HQ (which is also their home), they equipped it with three coffee machines, furnished the living room with cream loveseats and a 400-pound marble table, and decorated with porcelain vases tastefully printed with breasts, rehomed from a breast-milk startup that was moving out of the state. They installed a cold plunge tub on the deck, naturally, and a weights bench in the living room. To cap off the startup vibes, they hung a bedazzled purple Vently “V,” gifted from an investor, above the fireplace. They purchased an eight-seat Escalade so they could travel together. The month after they moved in, the team threw their first party. Khonaysser posted the invitation to Instagram: “Wine dinner. Eight strangers. … Dinner, drinks on us. Dm us.” Hundreds responded — nannies, tech workers, venture capitalists, local politicos — which confirmed his hunch. “People are hungry for connection,” he said. “They just need some help.” The night of the party, he donned a butler’s jacket, set the table, and waited by the door. All 12 RSVPs showed up, and from then on, “Dinner With Strangers” became a monthly event. Nowadays, it boasts a 5,000-strong waitlist. In the past year, Vently has promoted and hosted hundreds of events: Orangetheory workouts, bank raves, boat parties, a SantaCon takeover, viral “lookalike” contests. It has partnered with TechCrunch and the Golden State Warriors (“They reached out to us!,” Khonaysser said). The company has amassed 12,700 followers on Instagram and in November launched a platform where event organizers and venues can list and sell tickets, send text blasts, and manage their communities. Of course, living with cofounders — and hosting parties in the home — can put a strain on relationships. But Gargi Kand, 26, Vently’s head of growth and self-proclaimed “big sister” of the house, thrives on intensity. (Last year, she ran a marathon with no training. “Don’t recommend it,” she said. “Dislocated my knee a month later.”) Living in a party house with her colleagues has been generally low-stress, she said, noting that the guys are respectful and clean up after themselves. The only disagreements are over Khonaysser’s “pathological need” to blast the heat; the others forgive him because he makes a killer espresso martini. As for romantic entanglements, only Khonaysser is in a relationship. “If someone has girl problems, I’m the one they talk to,” Kand said. Jacob Wells, 22, who went to college with Khonaysser and is Vently’s COO, said he’s on standby if Kand needs relationship tips. “Gargi comes to me when she wants a straight-shooter opinion on her many dating problems,” he said. Vently’s evolution has led the founders to expand far beyond hosting parties: They aim to be the online platform of choice for any event in the Bay. Think Eventbrite, but with fewer fees, and for Gen Z. Andrew Wasilewski, CEO of The Faight Collective, an artist event space in the Haight, is a happy early Vently adopter. “Eventbrite’s fees are brutal,” he said. “We don’t just want random ticket buyers. We want to build a real, engaged community.” If Vently can streamline his team’s marketing and admin work from eight apps to one? “Game-changer.” The demand for a hub that centralizes local community events is real, said Nicolas Meader, a VC at Lioncrest Ventures, which backed Vently’s seed round. “The hardest time to make friends is if you move after college,” he said. “You go from having 20 friends down the street to no one, plus a ton of work responsibilities. Vently [helps] you get involved in the community.” Vently closed out January with its biggest partner event yet: the Quarter Century Tech Giga Party, a 2,500-person, five-floor conference-turned-club-night at Temple nightclub that ran from 5 p.m. to 2 a.m. The team was hyped about the lineup, which included California State Treasurer Fiona Ma; VCs from Andreesen Horowitz, Sequoia, and Blackrock; and DJ sets from Twitch cofounder Justin Kan, and Arielle Zuckerberg (Mark’s sister). The night was beautifully chaotic: the layout was confusing, the acoustics made it hard to hear speakers, and attendees hadn’t been able to figure out if they should dress for a club or a conference. But there were many charming moments: the silent disco on the rainy rooftop, the hands that shot up when someone asked who’d used DeepSeek, the man in a cardboard robot costume doing the robot on the dance floor. It was a big night, but not Vently’s best party, according to some attendees, who referenced the 2025 New Year’s Eve masquerade ball, Hibernia bank rave in November, and the Halloween haunted mansion bash at a Palo Alto luxury estate. Khonaysser isn’t fazed by the growing number of well-funded event startups with which his company competes. “San Francisco is the best place to start something, the best place to party, the best place to make your mark,” he said. To drive that point home, Vently in January acquired issfback.com from an Andreessen Horowitz scout. In an odd twist, that website once redirected visitors to an October 2024 story in The Standard with the headline “SF is so back.” (We had nothing to do with it.) Now the URL takes you straight to Vently.

Title: Why Is the Trump Administration So Obsessed with Shipping Lanes?

Time Published: 2025-03-16T10:00:00Z

The Trump administration’s focus with shipping lanes and maritime infrastructure has been most visible in the Western media on the Panama Canal and Greenland but is occurring elsewhere as well. Most indications are that the goal is to push back Chinese influence while cementing US naval dominance so as to be capable of enacting a global maritime blockade of China. As is often the case with Trump, he is only saying more loudly what has been US policy for some time. The US has for years worked to sabotage China’s Belt and Road Initiative. The US Marines shifted their focus to sea control capabilities as part of an effort to maintain naval dominance over China. [1] CSIS, 2018 So this is not unique to the Trump administration or simply the result of Trump’s reported interest in ships. It is US policy to encircle China, control global shipping, and have the capability to shut down maritime trade routes. Washington is now attempting to take or increase control of key global maritime chokepoints. Recently introduced legislation from a bipartisan group of senators is illustrative. Its stated aim is to monitor and counter China’s expanding control over strategic ports worldwide. There’s much attention paid to that “expanding control” by American think tanks and politicians, who throw around maps likes this: What do the numbers say? Here’s the Jamestown Foundation: While the United States dominates global maritime security, there is a huge disparity in the other direction when it comes to influence over maritime trade. Unlike the PRC, which controls around 12.6 percent of global port throughput through COSCO and CMP, the United States has no state-backed firms among the world’s leading terminal operators. In terms of global port influence, the United States would likely rank behind not only the PRC but also the United Arab Emirates (DP World), France (CMA CGM/Terminal Link), and Singapore (PSA International). Nevertheless, the US is calling it a “​​direct threat to American national security and economic interests.” More from gCaptain: The Strategic Ports Reporting Act, introduced by Senators Mark Kelly (D-AZ), Ted Budd (R-NC), and Rick Scott (R-FL), would require the Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense to develop a comprehensive global mapping of ports considered vital to U.S. military, diplomatic, economic, and resource exploration interests. The legislation specifically targets efforts by the People’s Republic of China to build, buy, or control strategic maritime infrastructure around the world. That’s largely what the US is already doing. Let’s look at a few spots the US has circled as key to its goals. Panama Canal On March 4, BlackRock helped fulfill the Trump goal of “taking back” the Panama Canal when it purchased crucial berths on both sides of the waterway that sees about 6 percent of global trade passing through it. An Associated Press article reported that the sale effectively puts “the ports under American control after President Donald Trump [had] alleged Chinese interference with the operations of the critical shipping lane.” Nick Corbishley has more, including on US efforts to revive the Monroe Doctrine in order to squeeze China out of Latin America. But Panama ports accounted for only four percent of the deal value between BlackRock and Hong Kong-based CK Hutchinson. Other ports are in Mexico, the Netherlands, Egypt, Australia, Pakistan and elsewhere. While it was a BlackRock-led consortium making the deal, it was largely the result of a US pressure campaign on the seller. From the WSJ: In the days before finalizing the deal, Fink held calls with Trump, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and national security adviser Michael Waltz, ultimately garnering the administration’s blessing, according to people close to the deal. It was more than just a blessing: Behind the scenes, Hutchinson executives had grown uneasy that a hostile Trump administration could make life hard on their sprawling global conglomerate… Hutchinson executives had weighted selling these and dozens more ports before, but the timing wasn’t right. With Trump applying pressure — and Hutchinson shares trading at a substantial discount to the company’s underlying assets — that changed. …executives were surprised by Trump’s decision to revoke special trade privileges for Hong Kong, and Panama authorities had just announced an audit of Hutchinson’s contract. The story got more interesting on Thursday when Beijing, late to the party, made clear its displeasure with Hutchinson’s decision to sell to BlackRock. The website of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, the Chinese ministry in charge of the two special administrative regions, reposted a harsh criticism from the newspaper Tai Kung Pao towards the deal. What does that mean? Here’s more from Zichen Wang at Pekingnology: It is now crystal clear that Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing’s CK Hutchison never coordinated with Beijing against Donald Trump’s economic coercion… The Ta Kung Pao condemnation, translated below, reveals Beijing’s concern that BlackRock, a U.S. company, will cooperate with Washington to impose additional costs on Chinese shipping or even threaten Chinese maritime trade… The condemnation didn’t ask CK Hutchison to unwind the deal but did describe the deal reached so far as “in principle.” The Hong Kong conglomerate has now been asked to reflect which side it is on – Beijing’s or Washington’s. Shortly after news broke that the US is drawing up plans to get its military on site at the Panama Canal — perhaps a way to keep the pressure on Hutchinson in case it’s thinking about trying to back out of the deal? Here’s NBC News: U.S. Southern Command is developing potential plans from partnering more closely with Panamanian security forces to the less likely option of U.S. troops’ seizing the Panama Canal by force, the officials said. Whether military force is used, the officials added, depends on how much Panamanian security forces agree to partner with the United States. The Trump administration’s goal is to increase the U.S. military presence in Panama to diminish China’s influence there, particularly access to the canal, the officials said. It doesn’t get much clearer than that. Greenland “Greenland is growing in importance as we find ourselves in a global competition with China and in a new technological revolution with regards to warfare,” Rebecca Pincus, director of the Wilson Center’s Polar Institute and a former adviser to the U.S. Defense Department on Arctic strategy, told RFE/RL. “So, Greenland is important from a missile-defense perspective, from a space perspective, and from a global competition perspective, in which shipping and maritime sea lanes are increasingly important,” she said. For the purposes of this piece, I’ll focus just on the shipping. The US used Project Ukraine to isolate Russia from the other seven Arctic states (Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, and the US). Finland and Sweden are now, like the others, in NATO, and their Arctic regions are being further militarized. As a result, all Arctic states except Russia are NATO members. Greenland, as a self-governing territory of the Kingdom of Denmark, is by default part of NATO, but there has been talk about independence, and it has in the past flirted with a closer relationship to Beijing — although China has largely abandoned most of its interest in in recent years. Some background there from the Harvard Kennedy School Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs: China has shown interest in Greenland’s mineral wealth and proximity to potential shipping routes, but in recent years its presence on the island has dwindled. In 2018, China released a white paper detailing its Arctic strategy, including its intention to build a “Polar Silk Road,” in parallel with its Belt and Road Initiative infrastructure investments in other regions. During the 2010s, Greenland courted Chinese mining companies to invest, but subsequent mining projects involving Chinese partners have stalled or failed. Pressure from the United States also helped quash Chinese bids to construct new airports and convert an abandoned Danish naval base into a research station. Though Greenland has expressed openness to working with international partners, China has not renewed its overtures. Greenland occupies a key position along two potential shipping routes through the Arctic: the Northwest Passage, along the northern coastline of North America, and the Transpolar Sea Route, through the center of the Arctic Ocean. As Arctic sea ice melts, these routes could reduce shipping times and bypass traditional chokepoints like the Suez and Panama Canals. These routes are economically unfeasible at the moment, but that’s expected to change, which means more stuff to fight over. From Antiwar: The extent of Arctic Sea Ice is now “more than two million square kilometers less than it was in the late twentieth century,” and “reductions in the amount of Arctic sea ice that survives summer melt have resulted in more newly formed ice (first-year ice) and less of the relatively thick, old ice that makes up the perennial ice cover.” Computer models suggest that by 2060, “the oldest ice will have completely disappeared and the sea ice will reach an irreversible tipping point,” suggesting that the Arctic Ocean will be “seasonally ice-free” by the end of the 21st century, which may even allow for opening of new Trans-Arctic shipping routes that completely avoid Canadian and Russian territorial claims sometime in the next century. The changes to ice cover in the Arctic are expected to increase use of the NWP and NSR for shipping, and to open more areas of the Arctic for efficient resource extraction and export thereof. South Africa We wrote last month about the Trump administration’s pressure campaign against South Africa and how it’s likely that shipping and naval base considerations are playing a large role. Just to recap: in South Africa this focus means a lot more attention for a small outpost in the Western Cape called Simon’s Town, which is home to the South African Navy’s largest base. Why would Simon’s Town help explain US pressure on South Africa? Here are Dr Frans Cronje, head of the Washington DC-based Yorktown Foundation for Freedom, and Rear Admiral Robert Higgs (Ret), who commanded the Fleet of South Africa from 2008-2010 and served as Chief of Naval Staff from 2011 to 2016 (he was also the first SA Navy officer to attend the US Naval War College), writing at Real Clear World: Simonstown’s contemporary importance is best understood as one of three points of a triangle that determines the balance of power in the Indo-Pacific. That triangle is formed by drawing a 5,000 mile line northwards from Simonstown to Djibouti on the African east coast where the Bab al-Mandab Strait narrows the gateway into the Red Sea (and the Suez Canal beyond) to just 20 miles. The balance of power around that gateway shifted in 2016 when China was granted a lease on a naval base just more than a decade after the United States had secured a similar lease. From Djibouti extend the line 8,000 miles eastward to the Solomon Islands off the east coast of Australia. The Japanese, after crippling the US Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor, sought to occupy the islands to isolate Australia and their retaking was a key allied objective in the liberation of South-East Asia. However, in April of 2022, eight decades after the defeat of Japan, China signed a security pact with the Solomon Islands. As the islands lie east of the confines of the two major “island chains” around which John Foster Dulles’ Pacific containment strategy was conceived at the end of the Second World War the Chinese pact is the starkest challenge yet to the idea of the Pacific as “America’s lake”. Extend the line from the Solomon Islands back to Simonstown to complete the triangle and territory within sees the passage of more than half of all sea-borne global trade with the triangle’s three points determining access to the Red Sea, the South Atlantic, and the Pacific. Fight for the Red Sea On Feb. 1, President Donald Trump ordered the first airstrike of his presidency, against alleged senior Islamic State commanders in northern Somalia. That has continued: The US launched two airstrikes against Al Shabab in Somalia within a few days of each other. Not good. pic.twitter.com/4Ex3QMxqru — Dave DeCamp (@DecampDave) March 2, 2025 Why is the collapsed Horn of Africa country the recipient of so much violence from the “America First” administration? There are a few explanations. One could be found in friend of Trump Jeff Bezos’ Washington Post, which right on cue after the Feb. 1 airstrike was out with a story, “The Islamic State has regrouped in Somalia — and has global ambitions.” That would mean that the result of US counterterrorism strategy is that terrorism continues to magically spread like wildfire and that the US must bomb Somalia to smithereens in order to prevent ISIS from continuing to spread. The other explanation is that the US is in the process of increasing its presence in Somalia with an eye towards a battle over Red Sea shipping. Samar Al-Bulushi and Dr. Ahmed Ibrahim writing at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft believe this is the case: It is a clear indication of the growing geopolitical significance of the Horn of Africa, and comes at a time of mounting concerns (mostly attempts by Yemen’s Houthis to disrupt global shipping in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza) about securing the flow of international commerce via the Red Sea. There is also the issue of China’s military base in Djibouti. The US, Germany, Japan, and Italy all had military presences in Djibouti, but it became a problem when China opened its first foreign military base there in 2017. Beijing’s stated interest — like the others — is to protect its shipping. And according to Responsbile Statecraft, “Djibouti is also important for China’s Belt and Road Initiative as a key maritime stop and a new railway line to Ethiopia’s capital Addis Ababa that connects the countries. China is the largest investor in Djibouti, with a total of $14.4 billion in infrastructure being built, a huge sum for an economy that is only worth $4.67 billion.” For the US, however, it is unacceptable, and Washington became more determined to do something about it when Djibouti denied the US request to use force against the Houthis targeting ships trading with Israel. The US blamed China for Djibouti’s decision. Under Trump, we’re getting a renewed focus on Somalia and Somaliland: Rather than accept Djibouti’s position, foreign policy experts have sought to escalate tensions, blaming Djibouti for being pro-Houthi and pro-China. Hoping to find a more reliable partner, many propose that the United States recognize and work with Somaliland instead. Somaliland is an unrecognized state that asserted its independence from Somalia in 1991. Close to Yemen and next Somalia, it seems Somaliland offers everything Djibouti has with no strings attached. Project 2025 recommends “the recognition of Somaliland statehood as a hedge against the U.S.’s deteriorating position in Djibouti.” Again, the Trump administration is just ramping up existing US policy. Last year, the US signed a deal with the government of Somalia to construct up to five military bases for the Somali National Army in the name of bolstering the army’s capabilities in the ongoing fight against militant groups. The bases are intended for the Danab (“Lightning”) Brigade, a U.S.-sponsored Special Ops Force that was established in 2014. The US at first funded Danab from the State Department, which contracted with private security firm Bancroft Global. More recently, funding comes from the Pentagon’s proxy war fund called the 127e program, which bypasses congressional oversight by allowing US special operations forces to use foreign military units as surrogates in counterterrorism missions. Fun stuff. Across the Gulf of Aden, escalation with Yemen is now taking place. The Houthi movement (Ansarallah) announced on Wednesday that they will resume attacks on Israeli ships over Israel’s refusal to allow into Gaza what the Western media calls “aid”: It’s not aid. It’s water. It’s electricity. It’s food. It’s medicine. It’s the stuff of life. — Eman Abdelhadi (@emanabdelhadi) March 3, 2025 And so the Trump administration is upping sanctions pressure and issuing threats to Yemen (and Iran with belief that will restrict Houthi weapons) and has redesignated Ansarallah as a “foreign terrorist organization” but is also saying that should sanctions fail to achieve their objectives, they will take military action. And so they are. Still Going After Georgia Elsewhere, the US hasn’t forgotten about Georgia. NEW! A bipartisan legislation calling for sanctions against those undermining Georgian democracy, known as the MEGOBARI ACT, has now made its way to the U.S. Senate and the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee is expected to take up in a matter of days 1/3 — Alex Raufoglu (@ralakbar) March 7, 2025 What’s MEGOBARI really about? Former Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs James O’Brien was blunt in a July Subcommittee on Europe and Regional Security Cooperation hearing: allow the US to control the country with money pouring into media and NGOs and no China port. Here’s what he said: Two things. One is it should be clear to the governing party in Georgia that there is a path back, that having free and fair elections without violence against civil society, making whatever transparency requirements they want. This Foreign Agent Law, make it compatible with EU law rather than compatible with Russian law, and not have China develop a deep water port in Anaklia. These are steps that are really important for Georgia to take. The deep water port at Anakalia refers to China’s deal to build one there on Georgia’s Black Sea coast. So, once again US policy remains the same despite the turnover in government in Washington. China Counter Strategy Would the US really be so crazy to retry its Russia “isolation” strategy against China? That would inevitably mean a collapse of the global economy and a contest of who could withstand the pain longer. China, which is striving for autarky and would, barring future developments, have direct land connections to Russia and Central Asia for minerals, natural resources, and other needs, might not get as hurt as some like to believe. The US, meanwhile, would face product shortages — including in a defense industry reliant on China — and inflation that would make recent years seem quaint by comparison. More likely is that the bright minds in the bowels of the Blob envision a return to the China of 20 years ago when it helped enrich American oligarchs with its low-wage manufacturing but knew its place. China has other plans and has been preparing for years to withstand US containment efforts. The West’s failed attempt to collapse Russia turned out to be a major gift to China as Moscow and Beijing doubled down on their economic ties. Here’s a glimpse of the latest Beijing strategy courtesy of Kyle Chan at High Capacity: Chinese companies are racing to build factories around the world and forge new global supply chains, driven by a desire to circumvent tariffs and secure access to markets. Chinese companies have been building manufacturing plants directly in large target markets, such as the EU and Brazil. And they’ve been building plants in “connector countries” like Mexico and Vietnam that provide access to developed markets through trade agreements. Morocco, for example, has emerged as a surprisingly popular destination for Chinese investment tied to EV and battery manufacturing due to its trade agreements with both the US and the EU. While tariffs and trade relations may change over time, an expanding global production network creates more robust channels of market access for Chinese companies, particularly as local jobs become attached to Chinese factories. One might see this as the third phase of China’s development of global supply chains more generally. The first phase was about securing access to resources. The second phase—the Belt and Road Initiative—was about building the infrastructure for global production and shipping. And now the third phase is about securing access to markets. How can the US reasonably be expected to hold back this wave? It’s impossible — at least by peaceful means. That’s why China and Russia continue to insist on “strategic interdependence.” The only other option for the US, in attempting to be the lone actor that can determine global outcomes, burns the world down rather than accept others having a seat at the table. Notes [1] Background from The Forge: Aspects of the global order are being challenged by rising powers such as China, whose economic development and military evolution mean that even a superpower such as the United States can no longer assume Sea Control in contested areas. This reality manifests itself in General Berger’s guidance, where he is directs the Marine Corps to restructure in order to support Sea Control operations designed to maintain the Navy’s freedom of action. He sees a return of the Fleet Marine Force concept that was used to good effect during the Pacific Campaign of World War 2 where Marines were integrated into Navy Sea Control operations – in effect working directly for the Navy – rather than being the main effort with the Navy supporting them. Berger foreshadowed the release of a new concept – the Stand-in Forces – to support the US National Defense Strategy and the US Navy’s Distributed Maritime Operations (DMO) concept. The Stand-In Forces are designed to generate “technically disruptive, tactical stand-in engagements that confront aggressor naval forces with an array of low signature, affordable and risk-worthy platforms and payloads”. Thanks for the summer upper. Since Trump wants to time machine back to the McKinley era it would hardly be surprising that his admin is trying to revive Mahan and the sea power controls the world theory. But now that ships are increasingly vulnerable to attacks from above and below is that even possible? And when it comes to the Arctic the time frame suggests that Trump and his minions will be obsolete long before any of this becomes relevant. “Computer models suggest that by 2060, “the oldest ice will have completely disappeared and the sea ice will reach an irreversible tipping point,” suggesting that the Arctic Ocean will be “seasonally ice-free” by the end of the 21st century, which may even allow for opening of new Trans-Arctic shipping routes that completely avoid Canadian and Russian territorial claims sometime in the next century. The changes to ice cover in the Arctic are expected to increase use of the NWP and NSR for shipping, and to open more areas of the Arctic for efficient resource extraction and export thereof.” So is it all signal or is it just noise so the flighty Trump can pretend he actually has a foreign policy suited to the 21st century instead of he 19th? Here’s agreeing with Larry Johnson in Links that Trump needs to concentrate on that Peace Prize and detente–an achievable goal–rather than trying to be the new Teddy Roosevelt. new Trans-Arctic shipping routes that completely avoid Canadian and Russian territorial claims sometime in the next century. Presumably this is a factor in Trump’s drive to annex Canada and Greenland. The Northwest Passage becomes entirely within US territorial waters. Looking at that map showing Greenland, I’m going to guess that Trump sooner or later will be saying how the US needs Iceland too because of its strategic significance. The 390,000 people living there cannot be allowed to get in the way of Trump’s idea of security. Sorry, not sorry. Regardless. I can see a flaw with this plan for domination of the world’s shipping lanes by the US and that is the US Navy. They are not up to it. They are overstretched and undermanned with their ships falling behind in maintenance. Their actual numbers are going down and not much thought seems to be going into the vital support ships that the US Navy needs. The Navy is continuously being given new missions and the Admirals just say ‘Yessir’ and work out how they can try to do it. And now here you are talking about patrol squadrons for Panama, the Galapagos islands, Greenland, Somalia and god knows where else. Where will the ships come from. What about the people to man them. How is the logistics of it all going to work? You try to control everything and in the end you control nothing. And Navies are not cheap. Some may scoff at the PMC complaining about eviction from obscure or not so obscure study projects, but how much more wasteful and less employment friendly is the Pentagon, with its many golf courses and fixation on aircraft carriers and reliving the Battle of Midway? Musk has at least been somewhat consistent in calling the F35 “junk” but we are still waiting for that promised drawdown of military spending. If Trump takes a far too familiar blob direction and declares us at “war” with his critics therefore traitors then the Pentagon will of course never be touched, if anyone was expecting that. It is a bewildering time–and has been for years. I was wondering the same, what good is all this naval manoeuvring if you don’t have the ships, and the US definitely doesn’t have the ships, not even a merchant marine, really. And no capacity to build them, either. Nor the materials to build them, now that Trump is waging tariff warfare. Also, it seems to me that Greenland was of much more strategic significance in the cold war when the “GIUK Gap” was a thing and submarine launched nuclear missiles were considered the biggest threat. Greenland, Iceland and the UK have all cooperated with NATO against this threat, so what does acquiring Greenland add to the equation which already established NATO cooperation does not? And does this mean Trump is going after Iceland and the UK next? And anyway, isn’t the sub threat now obsoleted with Oreshnik? Is the idea that the US just plans to blow all container and tanker shipping out of the water, is putting ASuW missile bases within range of all commercial shipping as part of what is expected to be a final big showdown? Oreshnik is not a strategic silver bullet, in spite of all the hype. It in particular is a medium range IRBM with manoeuvring kinetic RVs replacing the nuclear warheads. That’s it. In principle, there’s a very short step to doing the same with long range ICBMs, except then you’re stepping closer to the risk of inviting a massive counterstrike when you launch it because there is no way to tell on launch if there is a nuke in the nose or not, so any and all ICBM launches will be assumed to be nukes (and trigger the counterstrike – use it or lose it). The reason Oresnik is a game changer is mainly European – it tells the decision makers in Paris, Berlin and London “we can hit you and not destroy your city” (and/or their military bases), so it dramatically increases the range of Russian NON-nuclear capabilities with absolutely nothing to counter it on the other side. Like Sarmat and Avangard? They already have the same capability with their ICBMs… Re when I said ‘The Navy is continuously being given new missions and the Admirals just say ‘Yessir’ ‘ Just read earlier today that the US Navy now has to send the USS Gravely, a guided-missile destroyer, to the Caribbean to patrol it. Maybe to stop the Gulf of America from being renamed back to the Gulf of Mexico again? https://archive.md/YsASc#selection-515.43-515.53 I thought they say “aye aye”. 🫡 All those strategic plans regarding shipping lanes are understandable, but how will they be implemented? 1) China reportedly has a shipbuilding capacity that is 232 times the one of the USA — which is itself negligible in absolute numbers on a worldwide scale. 2) The USA has an enormous backlog of repair and maintenance for the ships and submarines of its navy. 3) The navy is so short of technical resources and personnel that it must decommission ships before they even reached the end of their useful life. 4) Almost every shipbuilding project in the past couple of decades — littoral combat ship, Zumwalt-class destroyer, Ford-class aircraft carrier — and now Constellation-class frigate, all expensive boondoggles. 5) What regards the Arctic, the USA has yet to renew its hopelessly aged fleet of (one barely functioning) icebreakers — and since it is the first time in 50 years a firm from the USA designs and builds one, skills have been lost and everything takes much more time than expected. 6) The fleet of auxiliary ships has been whittling away, and, because of a lack of personnel, the navy is idling those essential logistical vessels. Far away naval bases need to be manned and resupplied, and must keep a reliable lifeline with the home country, and be able to rely upon a relief fleet could break a siege. It will be interesting to see how this will be achieved in view of all the aforementioned issues. Imperial overstretch on steroids aided by an unshakeable belief in one’s own propaganda. Looking at the economic and technological trends, say over several decades, any expansive US plan to maintain hegemony that requires growth relative to China are comforting pipe dreams. In part it is an admission that the capablility to provide a convoy system in time of war no longer exists. No cheap and cheerful escort carriers, no where near the numbers of anti-submarine corvettes needed. The ships most needed to be convoyed, the VLCC’s and gas carriers impossible to protect due to size and slowness. The Russian riposte is the Poseiden torpedo system targeted to block up the limited number of carrier repair harbours and to close the main canals and perhaps to force the closure of the Malacca Straight. Should be able to block up places like Simons Town as well if the yanks force their way in there. They have to keep hostilities below the official war level because they have no counter to enemy strategic weapons but have to damage their economies enough to make them toe the line. The possibilities of a mistake are incredibly high. This is just my opinion The Pres has struck his deal. It is clear that the President has fully positioned himeself to place blame upon others if things go bad (lifelong business and personal practice). He has made the deal that whatever the 2025 Presidential Transition Project has in its objectives is the plan going forward, he does not want to be bothered with the details, just give him the talking points so he can go back to acting the part he played on TV. In return, he is to made to look the good guy, the boss, the one with the bright ideas but never the clueless ones and, above all, never is he to hear rummors that he wears no clothes. So why is Trump so obsessed with shipping lanes? It’s all laid out in the 2025 Presidential Transition Project – great detail sprinkled throughout with national security being the rational control the shipping lanes… his Tariffs, his objectives, his talking points, his culling of the ‘woke’ his putting cost onto the NATO on europes dime ….on and on it goes. What amazes me is such agastatude and shock both parties pretend – when it’s all in the document – after-all many of the projects… as noted above have been a bi-partisan work — I suppose, to promote a common cause by hiding their support for Genocide and other bi-partisan attrocities and economic idiocy they seam to use their mutual complicity – a cross blackmail of sorts – the same sort of child arguments – No you did it…no you did it..no you did it loop to obfuscate through verbal complexity a glaring truth (to me alone maybe – my truth) A shining light at the top of the hill, or a true democracy, a true republic, is most endanged when stained with the blood of genocide, human rights abuses, unchecked power and a distrust/disdain for the people who have elected by those elected. – Their remains a chasim/ a void of legitimacey thrust upon this country by those driven by lust for power. The Trump has put his transparent 2025 Presidential Transition Project clothes on to play the part he wants. However, he is naked without all his boot lickers (probably the wrong anotomical part). A fraudulent king. Some parts of the 25 project to lend some credibility to my pontifications above. Make irregular warfare a cornerstone of security strategy. 1. Make burden-sharing a central part of U.S. defense strategy with the United States not just helping allies to step up, but strongly encouraging them to do so. 2. Support greater spending and collaboration by Taiwan and allies in the Asia–Pacific like Japan and Australia to create a collective defense model. 3. Transform NATO so that U.S. allies are capable of fielding the great majority of the conventional forces required to deter Russia while relying on the United States primarily for our nuclear deterrent, and select other capabilities while reducing the U.S. force posture in Europe. 4. Sustain support for Israel even as America empowers Gulf partners to take responsibility for their own coastal, air, and missile defenses both individually and working collectively. 3. Directly counter Chinese economic power with all elements of national power in North America, Central America, and the Caribbean to maintain maritime freedom of movement and protect the digital infrastructure of nations in the region. Prioritize a denial defense against China.U.S. defense planning should focus on China and, in particular, the effective denial defense of Taiwan. “Tonight, I am also asking you to pass the United States Reciprocal Trade Act, so that if another country places an unfair tariff on an American product, we can charge them the exact same tariff on the exact same product that they sell to us. President Donald J. Trump, 2019 State of the Union Address” partner countries match the U.S. tariff rate under pressure from the American President, and then under Scenario Two, in which the U.S. matches the tariffs of partners that refuse to lower their tariffs. Project 2025 is itself a throwback to the Reagan/Gingrich drown the government era but as you say it’s doubtful Trump has even read the lengthy document. But I do think it’s valid to say that Trump is trying to revive Reagan rather than the more intellectual Nixon. And guess what…so was Obama. Almost all of our presidents are figureheads in one sense or another. They used to call Eisenhower “the great golfer.” That said, Trump’s motives seem a lot more obscure to me. Maybe we need a Ouija board. The US Navy’s main mission, as presented by a retired US Navy admiral in an article in War on the Rocks, is to restrict access of enemy vessels on the shipping lanes. The Freedom of Navigation and protection of shipping lanes blurb is just that. The truth is just the opposite. Good to see that for now the Northeast Passage is not disputed… The arctic sea passage is in the 2025 Project for strategic resources and shipping lane control. Which is why Trump is demanding that Canadians hand their country over to him – he wants their strategic resources and have control of those shipping lanes. If he was smart, he might have suggested a sort of North American Federation to do this by but instead he just wants a land grab with Canadian resources – which includes its people – to help balance the US bottom line financially i.e. an Anschluss. ‘As of March 17, 2025, Canada’s national net worth, the sum of national wealth and its net foreign asset position, is estimated at roughly $17.5 trillion.’ For some people, that would be pretty hefty payout if Trump ever did it. For the bulk number of Canadians however, they would be net losers big time. In the words of Dr Martin Luther King Jr almost sixty years ago, “My country is the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today.” The US already controls Panama via a massive military presence: it can ‘invade’ Panama from within at any time, as it did in 1989. The US also maintains a sizeable military presence in Greenland. Thule AFB, recently renamed Pituffik Space Base, is home to B52 nuclear bombers, one of which exploded there in 1968. So all this talk about owning or controlling Panama and Greenland is for show. The US already owns them. A good video discussion. https://conflictsforum.substack.com/p/europe-and-israel-decline-and-fragment Did I miss any reference to Ellesmere Island? Given what I’ve watched about Trump messups re laws, he problem misspelled “shopping lines” in an attempt to get people buying stuff.

Title: China Ramps Up Criticism of Li Ka-shing’s BlackRock Ports Deal

Full Content:
Chinese authorities increased pressure on CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. over its plan to sell its Panama ports stake by sharing a second newspaper commentary attacking the deal. The Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office on Saturday reposted a commentary originally published in Ta Kung Pao, saying the planned sale of the ports by the Hong Kong company had triggered deep concerns among Chinese people and questioned whether the deal was harming China and aiding evil. “Why were so many important ports transferred to ill-intentioned US forces so easily? What kind of political calculations are hidden in the so-called commercial behavior on the surface? Great entrepreneurs are never cold-blooded and speculating profit-seekers, but passionate and proud patriots!” said the opinion piece in the newspaper, a publication that tends to support Beijing’s policies. The Chinese government agency, the country’s top office on Hong Kong affairs, first indicated its displeasure over the transaction last week by sharing an earlier Ta Kung Pao commentary. That post drove CK Hutchison shares down 6.4% on Friday, their biggest decline since 2020. The conglomerate founded by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing, this month agreed to sell off the bulk of its global ports business to a consortium led by BlackRock Inc. The sale included a controlling share in ports near the Panama Canal, an apparent victory for US President Donald Trump after he had raised concerns about their ownership. The first Ta Kung Pao commentary called on companies to be careful about which “side they should stand on.” It said social media users had accused CK Hutchison of “spineless groveling” and “selling out” Chinese people. Under the agreement, CK Hutchison will sell 43 ports in 23 countries, while keeping facilities in mainland China and Hong Kong. The transaction is set to generate cash proceeds of more than $19 billion. Because the deal involves only overseas assets it is unlikely to need Beijing’s sign-off, but the recent attacks have stoked concern that China might somehow try to intervene. The fresh opinion piece lauded the “heroic actions” of Ren Zhengfei, founder of Huawei Technologies Co., a Chinese phone and device manufacturer that has long been targeted on national security grounds by the US and other Western nations. “Both history and reality remind entrepreneurs at the forefront of the storm that in the face of the U.S.’s bullying, only by standing firmly with the country and fighting bravely can they defend their country, win dignity and maintain their reputation,” the commentary said. Those who choose to do the opposite, it said, may “make a lot of money for a while, but in the end they will have no future and will bear history’s blame.” Calls and an email sent to CK Hutchison offices in Hong Kong went unanswered outside of office hours on Sunday. The apparent expression of disapproval by Chinese authorities underscores the balancing act facing executives whose companies get caught up in the widening China-US rivalry. CK Hutchison and sister company CK Asset Holdings Ltd. are registered in the Cayman Islands — a move carried out in 2015 as part of a group-wide restructuring. CK Hutchison accrues almost 90% of its revenue from outside of mainland China and Hong Kong. The potential purchase by BlackRock would be one of the biggest acquisitions of the year. Before the agreement, Trump argued that China had taken over the critical waterway, without providing evidence, and that the US was paying too much for the passage of ships. He previously demanded the fees charged on US naval and merchant ships be lowered, or else Panama should return the canal to the US. With assistance from Alice Huang. ©2025 Bloomberg L.P.

By Joseph Ledford, Real Clear Wire March 15, 2025 A revitalized approach to hemispheric security has emerged in the early days of Donald Trump’s second term. “Americas First” is the principle, a strategic orientation to better position the United States for a renewal of the Pax Americana. Although skeptics fear a worldwide retrenchment, the Trump administration’s recommitment to the Western Hemisphere is not a retreat from global superpowerdom. Instead, the Trump administration has abandoned the inchoate universalism that prevents decision-makers from distinguishing between the nation’s core and peripheral interests. Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) are vital to security of the United States, and the Trump administration acts accordingly. Trump and his foreign policy hands Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Security Advisor Mike Waltz understand that, for America to project power globally, its neighborhood must be in order. In prioritizing the Western Hemisphere, Trump seeks to eradicate drug cartels, combat China’s malign influence, and strengthen America’s regional economic and security partnerships. These policy aims respond to the concerns and hopes of ordinary citizens while reasserting American influence in the Western Hemisphere.

In a bid to bring about regional security and prosperity, Trump’s second term has ushered in a restoration of the Monroe Doctrine. For without regional stability, how can the United States continue to support its allies and partners while confronting its adversaries? In conjunction with reducing illegal immigration, addressing the fentanyl crisis is Trump’s chief priority. On day one, Trump signed an executive order to begin the process of designating drug cartels and other transnational criminal organizations (TCO) as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTO) and Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGT). On February 20, the State Department finalized the FTO and SDFT designations for six cartels and two transnational gangs. It gives the administration additional legal tools for limiting “material support or resources” and the ability to apply harsher economic sanctions. Trump’s efforts have catalyzed a whole-of-government response to the fentanyl crisis. The Department of Justice capitalized on the designations by dedicating resources to pursuing a “total-elimination policy.” The Central Intelligence Agency, for its part, ramped up its drone surveillance program in Mexico, from which it shares intelligence gathered on fentanyl manufacturing with Mexican authorities. US Northern Command also conducts surveillance operations on the American side of the border, and the 7th Special Forces Group has undertaken a training mission with the Mexican Marine Infantry. States have joined the initiative, too. Arizona launched Operation Desert Guardian to partner with the federal government in countering TCOs. To pressure Canada and Mexico into more aggressive anti-fentanyl efforts, Trump proposed a 25% tariff on their imports. As a result, Canada designated the cartels as FTOs and began Operation Blizzard to curb drug smuggling at the US-Canada border. Mexico dispatched 10,000 troops to the US-Mexico border to fight narcotics trafficking, extradited 29 most wanted cartel members to America, and may impose tariffs on Chinese goods. Still, Trump prefers tougher measures, pressing Canada and Mexio for harder campaigns. With a trade war looming, and whiplash negotiations underway, Trump paused tariffs until April 2 on auto imports and goods in accordance with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Despite the contention among neighbors, however, a stronger North American Union against both the cartels and China appears within reach. The Trump administration should notch a strategic win before the diplomatic gambit turns irreversibly counterproductive. Such drastic policy changes and redeployment of key personnel and resources foreshadow a fatal confrontation. In the words of National Security Advisor Waltz, the United States will “unleash holy hell” on TCOs. What is more, narcotics have become a malevolent feature of US-China relations. The United States has entered a proxy war with China over the fentanyl crisis. America cannot degrade and destroy the cartels without confronting China for its financial and material contributions to their enterprise. China not only provides the precursor chemicals and pill press equipment needed to produce fentanyl, but also the money laundering services used to wash the profits. For now, Trump will impose tariffs on Chinese imports—but 20% will not compel a change in the Chinese Communist Party’s behavior. “If war is what the U.S. wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war or any other type of war,” the Chinese Foreign Ministry responded, “we’re ready to fight till the end.” Trump’s outreach to America’s neighbors demonstrates his predilection for confrontational but effective diplomacy. In late January, the unpopular Colombian President Gustavo Petro learned a hard geopolitical lesson. After Petro’s impromptu refusal to let repatriation flights land in Colombia, Trump threatened steep tariffs, which would ruin the Colombian economy at marginal cost to the United States. Petro folded immediately. Meanwhile, Panamanian President José Raúl Mulino engaged in skirmish with Trump over the Panama Canal. In an opening move against China’s undue regional influence, Trump targeted the Chinese threat to the sovereignty of the Canal through dual-use infrastructure, namely the Ports of Balboa and Cristóbal operated by the Hong Kong firm CK Hutchison Holdings. Invoking the 1977 Torrijos-Carter Treaties, Trump vowed on multiple occasions to reassert American control over the Canal, leading to a series of public barbs between Mulino and Trump. The conflict set the stage for Secretary Rubio’s inaugural trip abroad to put the administration’s “Americas First” approach into practice. In signaling the region’s significance, the secretary chose Central America and the Caribbean as his destination, a once-in-a-century kind of visit. There, Rubio bolstered regional strategic partnerships by securing a series of joint agreements with Panama, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Guatemala, and the Dominican Republic on a host of issues, ranging from immigration and transnational crime to energy and economic development. Panama was first on Rubio’s itinerary, where he resolved the Canal issue. Notwithstanding the ongoing dispute over transit fees for US vessels, Mulino strived to honor the treaty and meet Trump’s demands for a sovereign Canal. Not only has Panama withdrawn from the Belt and Road Initiative but the Panama Canal Authority recently completed a Cyber Cooperation Arrangement with US Southern Command to shore up the Canal’s cybersecurity operations. Crucially, too, BlackRock negotiated a deal to buy the Balboa and Cristóbal ports from Hutchison. The agreement followed in the wake of Panama’s audit of the Hutchison contract, a lease that the Panamanian attorney general declared unconstitutional. Panama no longer wanted China to have a stake in the ports and American investors obliged, providing a viable alternative for the ownership of a key strategic asset. Here, one must disregard the political theatrics and examine the actions. Although neither Trump nor Mulino waivered in their rhetoric, US-Panamanian security cooperation strengthened and China’s influence diminished. In the end, the Trump administration achieved their aims. While the Trump administration embraces regional partners, old enemies of the United States get their just deserts. After Joe Biden’s relaxed Cuba policy, Trump instituted a harder line: relisting Cuba on list of State Sponsors of Terrorism; reactivating the LIBERTAD Act; reviving the Cuba Restricted List; and revamping visa restrictions on Cuban officials. Under his administration, the appendages of hostile foreign powers will not experience a reprieve until they meaningfully reform and break with America’s adversaries. Soon, for instance, the United States shall seek Nicaragua’s expulsion from the Dominican Republic–Central America Free Trade Agreement. In Venezuela, Trump initially gifted dictator Nicolás Maduro a détente opportunity, but Maduro botched it and maximum pressure returned. Trump sought a deal, whereby Venezuela accepted thousands of repatriations in exchange for him permitting Chevron to operate in Venezuela, a sanction exemption that Biden authorized to inspire democratic elections. On February 26, Trump announced he rescinded Chevron’s license because Maduro refused to comply with this arrangement, and he had not honored the election results. Days later, when a Venezuelan warship harassed ExxonMobil operations in Guayana, the State Department threatened “consequences for the Maduro regime.” Given Trump’s designs on regional security, and his willingness to tighten sanctions, Maduro’s dictatorship lives on borrowed time. To counter China and promote regional prosperity, the Trump administration also adopted a fresh approach to economic growth. Reviving a first-term economic program, América Crece 2.0 replaced Biden’s Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity, which failed to evolve beyond a forum to discuss economic integration. Under América Crece 2.0, the State Department and the United States Trade Representative will leverage an upgraded U.S. International Development Finance Corporation to spur private capital investment in critical sectors while enhancing America’s six regional free trade agreements. In doing so, the Trump administration understands that American private capital offers the right antidote to state-led Chinese development in the Americas. Harnessing it for public-private partnerships will be the optimal way to extirpate Chinese influence via investment in the region. Yet not all policies herald a positive direction. The Biden administration saddled the Trump team with an intractable problem: Haiti. A collapsing Haiti represents a grave threat to the Caribbean and the United States. Rubio reaffirmed American support for the Multinational Security Support Mission led by Kenya, and US funding for it continues. The Trump administration recognizes the dire circumstances, but they possess limited options for solving Haiti’s civil strife before it devolves into a failed state. As Haiti spirals further into disorder, the deployment of American troops seems doubtful but could become unavoidable. Trump’s bid to put the Americas first corresponds with congressional goals. A champion of reasserting the Monroe Doctrine, Senator Jim Risch (R-ID), the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, worked to facilitate the making of a coherent, long-term policy for the Western Hemisphere. Two years of legislative toiling yielded a statutory requirement for the Trump administration to send Congress “a 5-year strategy to promote security and the rule of law in the Western Hemisphere.” Spearheaded by Risch, the Western Hemisphere Partnership Act became law in December through the National Defense Authorization Act. It mandates the secretary of state to submit the comprehensive strategy by mid-June to the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The secretary must then provide yearly briefings on its implementation. Rubio, who co-sponsored the legislation as a senator, will craft this new strategy. It must deliver a practical framework for hemispheric defense and development. From China and the cartels to nearshoring industries and infrastructure development, the United States must solve acute challenges and take advantage of promising opportunities in the Western Hemisphere. The United States has arrived at an inflection point with great consequence for world order. The decisions made during Trump’s second term will reverberate in the next decades, especially in the Western Hemisphere. Whether on trade, development, crime or defense, the Trump administration must persist in reinvigorating America’s relationship with its neighbors to work toward solutions based on shared interests. This process may be rife with closed-door disagreements and public disputes, but the ultimate outcome will land the Western Hemisphere on a stronger footing for the 21st century. As the Trump administration reorients strategic focus on the Americas, regional partners should benefit from closer economic and security cooperation with the United States, while those countries actively engaged with China and its authoritarian partners against American interests should be deterred and isolated. American concerns are not always synonymous with those of every country in the Western Hemisphere, but an American-led hemispheric order safeguards the region’s economic and security interests. A secure and prosperous hemisphere augments the domestic determinants of American power. It will prove to be the wellspring of the Pax Americana revival. Joseph A.

Title: This 15.6% Dividend Is A Smart ‘Buy The Dip’ Play

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster , Contributor. Buy on the dip There are two things I need to bring to your attention right now, especially if you’re an income investor. One is my outlook for the market, as volatility really hits home. The other is a 15.6%-yielding(!) fund that just changed its name and ticker—and really grabbed contrarians’ attention in the process. Let’s start with what’s really going on with this wild market. The NASDAQ is now down more than 10% from its peak price, and stocks on the whole are down for the year. I don’t expect this to last very long. My take: 2025 is likely to be a year of volatility rather than a year of decline. Even so, the volatility we’ve seen so far is relatively new. It was only the middle of last month that stocks started making a clear reversal from their long climb, and the NASDAQ 100 is still up 12.6% annualized over the last three years as I write this, while the S&P 500 is up an annualized 9.6%. Market Dip Just a quick look at this chart tells you that buying the dip during this period has been a winning strategy. It also tells us that both indices are setting up for another dip-buying opportunity, where stocks will fall to a point where they become irresistible. During volatile markets, however, the psychological pressures are tough, with sharp declines and trillions of dollars of wealth seemingly vanishing in a matter of days. This has always been a problem for markets, but I think it’s less of a problem now, for one reason: COVID-19. This might sound a bit strange, so let me explain. At the start of the pandemic, trillions of dollars disappeared in hours. People were literally prohibited from economic activity, as they were forced to stay in their homes. Oil prices actually went negative. And yet stocks recovered, both because of monetary policy (the Fed swooped in with emergency rate cuts and massive buys of government bonds—so-called “quantitative easing”) and, after that, technological progress (including changes in infrastructure responding to the pandemic, such as new supply chains; new medical technologies; and, of course, AI). In other words, investors have already seen the worst and it’s fresh in their minds, so even if we face a recession over the next year or two, stocks are unlikely to collapse like they did in 2020 or 2008. So, in a sense, this time is different, but not in the way one might think: People are less likely to give in to total fear (or 2020-like despair!) as the business cycle weakens. Which means that while stocks are likely to fall, they’re not likely to collapse. In such a situation, a smart play is to buy the dip slowly, steadily and strategically. Since fear is unpredictable, we can’t wait for the market to bottom and swoop in to buy everything, but we can start buying when there’s a correction, buy a little more as it worsens, and buy even more when it becomes a full-on bear market. And we can essentially double our “dip-buying discount” by purchasing stocks within a closed-end fund (CEF) trading at an attractive discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio). That’s where the BlackRock Technology and Private Equity Term Trust (BTX), payer of that outsized (to say the least) 15.6% dividend. BTX is the fund’s newest ticker, which BlackRock changed from BIGZ last month. It also changed the name from the old monicker: the BlackRock Innovation and Growth Term Trust. As the name now says, the fund invests part of its portfolio in private equity, which can have bigger returns than public stocks in the long run, while the “term” refers to the fact that the fund will come to maturity in 12 years. (Although there is fine print stating that the fund can convert to a perpetual fund, and I fully expect this to happen, so I don’t pay much attention to the “term” in the name here). The most important thing here (besides the huge dividend, of course) is the discount, which has been narrowing lately: BTX Discount Narrows Since the melodramatic fear-induced selloff of 2022, BTX’s discount has narrowed as investors realized that a 20%-off sale on the fund’s tech-stock holdings, including Marvell Technology (MRVL) and NVIDIA (NVDA), was a sweet deal. BlackRock, the fund’s management firm, even realized this and started a stock-buyback program in early 2024. There’s just one problem (or at least there was): BTX (under its former incarnation, BIGZ) lagged other BlackRock tech CEFs. But these days the fund is worth your attention. The changes to this fund run much deeper than a rebrand. BlackRock also made major revisions to its mandate, letting it invest even more in tech stocks. Now, at least 80% of its assets will be in public and private tech companies, instead of the previous focus on small- and mid-cap growth stocks. That mandate didn’t work because small-cap stocks have underperformed other types of stocks for years, as you can see in the benchmark index fund for small caps, in blue below, compared to the NASDAQ (in orange) and the S&P 500 (in purple). Small Caps Lag This wasn’t always the case, and the reason why small caps underperform more now than they used to is another article unto itself. In short, this was one of the reasons why I was wary of BTX when it was BIGZ. Ironically, BIGZ wasn’t as “big-focused” as it should have been. That has changed, along with BTX’s fund managers, with the fund now being run by Tony Kim and Reid Menge. This is great news because Tony and Reid also manage the BlackRock Technology Opportunities Fund (BGSAX), which has run the table on the indices, including the NASDAQ, a particularly tough one to beat. This kind of outperformance deserves a premium, which BTX will likely get eventually. Until then, the fund remains attractive when it trades at a discount, as it is now.
