Readers should conduct independent research before taking any actions related to the project mentioned in this piece. This article should not be regarded as investment advice. Crypto adherents are keeping a close eye on one of the most talked-about giants in the market: Solana. Solana has rallied by nearly 10% in late August, currently trading between $187 and $206, with analysts predicting a potential breakout toward $250–$300 if ETF clarity is achieved. SOL is demonstrating the strength of institutional interest, with Solana attracting $1.25 billion from Pantera Capital. Alongside these heavyweights, another project is creating shockwaves: Bitcoin Swift (BTC3). Already, $1.3 million has been raised, with more than 5,500 users having joined. An early launch has been officially announced for August 30, accompanied by a massive bonus structure for participants. Solana continues to impress with high throughput and low costs, attracting big names like BlackRock and CME as it becomes a cornerstone of tokenized assets. The asset showcases the strength of blockchain adoption today. However, neither Solana pays its holders direct, programmable staking rewards at every stage. That is what makes Bitcoin Swift different. BTC3 is designed to reward participants today, not just after launch, and its presale payouts prove that. Bitcoin Swift is not just another token. It is a next-generation defi operating system. At its core is Proof-of-Yield (PoY), a dynamic system that distributes rewards based on network activity, governance, and environmental efficiency. The result is programmable rewards sent at the end of each presale stage. BTC3 launches first on Solana, giving ultra-fast transactions and fees below $0.01 while tapping into an ecosystem of over 400 projects. Then, in 2026, it will migrate to its own blockchain via a 1:1 trustless bridge, scaling up to institutional adoption. The countdown has begun. Stage 7 is the last stage before launch, and only three days remain. To mark this milestone, BTC3 introduced the “Everything Must Go Bonus Event,” rewarding the fastest 130: The numbers are staggering. A Tier 4 contributing $10,000 secures $30,000 worth of BTC3 instantly at presale price. If BTC3 trades at $15 post-launch, that position skyrockets beyond $60,000. The math explains why this final stage is moving so quickly. BTC3 is capped at 45 million tokens. Allocation is carefully structured: 50% for PoY rewards (22.5M), 30% for presale (13.5M), 15% for liquidity pools (6.75M), and 5% for team and reserves (2.25M). This ensures long-term sustainability and scarcity. Additionally, the roadmap demonstrates that BTC3 is more than just hype. This trajectory ensures BTC3 is a project built to deliver both short-term excitement and long-term adoption. Security is equally strong. Cyberscope Audit, Solidproof Audit, and Spywolf Audit have reviewed BTC3. On top of this, full KYC verification has been completed, making it one of the safest opportunities on the market. The crypto community is buzzing with excitement as influencers dissect BTC3’s potential: These insights are driving even more attention as the presale draws to a close. Solana is proving that institutional adoption is here. However, Bitcoin Swift combines both short-term explosive rewards and a roadmap that stretches into 2026, giving it the edge. With only 3 days left before its August 30 launch, $1.3m raised, and bonus events rewarding speed, BTC3 is the most urgent opportunity in the market today.

Title: Loma Larga looming large: why fast-tracking mines leads to financial and social blowback

Time Published: 2025-08-27T08:55:03Z

Environmental defenders gather to announce several legal actions protesting the arbitrary decision of the Ministry of Environment, Water and Ecological Transition (“MAATE”) to grant an environmental licence for exploitation to Dundee Precious Metals. Photo courtesy: Federation of Indigenous and Campesino Organizations of Azuay Province. In the face of economic uncertainty and a changing global order, governments around the world are engaging in a growing trend of deregulation of the mining industry and fast-tracking of extractive projects. Among these is a controversial Free Trade Agreement between Canada and Ecuador that heavily favours corporate interests over human rights and the environment. Yet the long-term environmental impacts and heavy social backlash that come from cutting corners only lead to worsening community relations for companies and increased financial risk for investors. As Canada is the home of about half of the world’s publicly listed mining companies, Canadian companies are likely to be increasingly disrupted by community conflicts both at home and abroad as a result of this broad deregulatory push. One such conflict is arising from Dundee Precious Metals’ Loma Larga gold mine in Southern Ecuador. Earlier this month, as investors gathered in a boardroom on Bay Street in Toronto for a special shareholders meeting, a coalition of Ecuadorian organizations and their Canadian allies filed a complaint with the Ontario Securities Commission against the company for allegedly misleading its shareholders about serious legal threats to its Loma Larga project. The proposed Loma Larga gold mining project has been marred by controversy and social opposition since its inception. It is located in the páramo de Kimsakocha, an ecologically sensitive high-altitude wetland that is crucial for climate change adaptation and water security for downstream communities, including Cuenca, the third-largest city in Ecuador. Dundee acquired the project in 2021, and it has been under a court-ordered suspension since 2022 — upheld again in 2023 — amid ongoing legal battles related to safe drinking-water guarantees for those downstream communities. The project’s Indigenous consultation process is now also being challenged by the Indigenous community of San Pedro de Escaleras in the courts due to allegations of irregularities. This presents a bleak outlook for Dundee, as there are legal precedents in Ecuador for permanently shutting down a mining project and revoking its licenses on the basis of both environmental concerns and a lack of social license — yet the OSC complaint alleges that none of this information has been transparently conveyed to investors. Under Ontario law, companies that are publicly traded are required to disclose certain legal risks — such as the court challenges Dundee is facing over the Loma Larga project — if they could result in the lengthy suspension or even permanent closure of the mine, especially when there are legal precedents that would support that result. These measures are in place to protect investors. Yet, Dundee has continued to paint a rosy picture to its shareholders, announcing in a July press release, that it had received its environmental licence and “successfully completed” the prior informed Indigenous consultation process for the Loma Larga project. The legal challenge to its consultation process is conspicuously absent from the release, as are the two referenda in 2019 and 2022 where downstream communities voted overwhelmingly against the mine. Dundee’s press release further claims that it “fulfilled the requirements of the August 2023 ruling by the Provincial Court of Azuay” — but fails to mention one of the other key conditions for the suspension to be lifted: The courts must accept two reports on how to guarantee safe drinking water to the downstream communities, one of which, authored by the utility company for the municipality of Cuenca (ETAPA), is highly critical of the Loma Larga project. Until these reports are accepted and reconciled, the mine remains suspended. The Loma Larga project is an inherently risky endeavour. It has faced staunch resistance for the last three decades. The Federation of Indigenous and Campesino Organizations of Azuay province (FOA) has organized highway blockades demanding Dundee’s environmental licence be revoked and a full moratorium on mining in the paramos. Even under the pro-extractive Noboa government, the persistent controversy surrounding the gold mine forced Ecuador’s minister of energy and mines to announce another suspension of all work on the project, until Dundee’s environmental impact study has been adequately disseminated to the public. It’s clear that some of Dundee’s shareholders are paying attention — major investing firm Blackrock has already chosen to decrease its risk by dropping its percentage holding from 12.35 per cent to 8.48 per cent. While the Ontario Securities Commission takes time to conduct an investigation into Dundee’s pattern of lack of disclosure, shareholders should take this time to press Dundee for answers. And when all signs point to trouble ahead for the Loma Larga project, hopefully they will see that it’s not worth the risk. Ultimately, the best way to safeguard financial investment is to ensure high standards of environmental and human rights due diligence, rather than prioritizing corporate interests. This protects not just people and the planet, but also investors. With more deregulation and less accountability, companies such as Dundee can mislead shareholders about the viability of their projects and investors might find their portfolios on the wrong side of the law.

Title: Former lottery boss Dermot Griffin to lead pension auto-enrolment agency
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/08/27/employers-face-tight-turnaround-preparing-for-auto-enrolment/
Time Published: 2025-08-27T05:00:01Z
Full Content:
Former National Lottery chief executive Dermot Griffin has been picked to lead the agency responsible for the automatic enrolment (AE) pensions system, which is set to come into force in January. Mr Griffin, a chartered accountant, served as head of the National Lottery from 2005 to 2019 before becoming chief executive of the Credit Union Service Organisation for Payments. He is also a non-executive director of the Irish Aviation Authority. The board of the new National Automatic Enrolemnt Retirement Savings Authority (Naersa) will be chaired by Roma Burke, an experienced actuary with extensive knowledge of the pensions industry. Ms Burke has previously served as chairwoman of the Pensions Council and was a member of the Pensions Commission, leading its technical subcommittee. Naersa will administer the auto-enrolment (AE) scheme, called My Future Fund, which will capture about 800,000 workers in the State who are not in a workplace or private pension plan. “We received a very high level of interest in these positions from very strong candidates. This shows that MyFuture Fund, and its importance to the future of Ireland, has resonated with people, and gives me the luxury of selecting individuals from a range of backgrounds and with diverse and extensive experience,” said Minister for Social Protection Dara Calleary. The introduction of the AE system – known as My Future Fund, which Naersa will run – has been subject to several delays in recent years. The system is now set to start on January 1st. AE will apply to workers aged between 23 and 60 who earn at least €20,000 per year across one or more jobs and who are not already members of an occupational pension scheme. Employers and employees will each initially contribute 1.5 per cent of gross earnings to their pension pot, with the Government adding a further 0.5 per cent. The contributions are due to increase in stages, reaching 6 per cent and 2 per cent respectively in year 10. Under auto-enrolment, funds will be managed by three investment providers: Irish Life Investment Managers, Amundi and BlackRock. The AE scheme is expected to hold more than €20 billion of assets on behalf of beneficiaries within 10 years, rising potentially to more than €300 billion over 30-40 years, according to the Government. “It will be my goal to make sure that employers are supported through the introduction of MyFuture Fund by ensuring that Naersa performs all of its functions,” said Mr Griffin. “However, the other side of this is making sure Naersa protects employees, and compliance will be a key area of my focus. This is a hugely important moment for Ireland, and I feel a great deal of pride to be the person in charge of getting Naersa on its feet and ensuring MyFuture Fund is up and running.” AE was first proposed in 2006 by then minister for social affairs Séamus Brennan, but has been through years of false dawns. Enabling draft legislation, originally scheduled to be published before the Dáil’s summer recess in 2023, was finally signed into law in July last year. Indian information technology company Tata Consultancy Services was hired in 2024 to build and run the system.

Title: Bitcoin Sentiment On Binance Turns Bullish – But Is The Market Setting A Trap?

Over the past two weeks, Bitcoin (BTC) has dropped more than 7%, falling from around $117,400 on August 21 to a low of $108,666 earlier today. Despite the bearish slide, some encouraging exchange data suggests improving sentiment. However, analysts warn this could once again be a setup for institutions to trap retail buyers. According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor BorisD, the Binance vs. Other Exchanges BTC Volume Delta turned positive on August 25, registering $676 million. This indicates that Binance users have shifted decisively into spot buying mode. Notably, this trend has not been observed on other major exchanges. Since Binance is the world’s largest exchange in terms of liquidity and user base, its flows are often considered a reflection of broader market sentiment. At present, retail investors appear to be fueling buying pressure. While this can support demand for BTC, it also creates an opening for institutional investors to drive prices lower, flushing out retail positions before the market resumes an upward move. BorisD highlighted that historically, when Binance users increase spot buying, Bitcoin’s price often declines. On the contrary, when selling pressure rises, BTC tends to recover in price. He explained: This dynamic highlights the clear difference between retail and institutional behavior. Retail traders often act emotionally and position themselves on the wrong side, while institutions strategically engineer liquidity around these flows. In conclusion, the analyst said that although rising spot buying on Binance is encouraging, a positive delta does not always mean a bullish signal. On the contrary, it can expose retail buying pressure than can be exploited as an opportunity by institutions. Analysts remain divided on whether Bitcoin can set a new all-time high (ATH) in the near term. Some stress that BTC must hold above the $100,000 level to preserve its overall bullish structure. In a separate analysis, crypto analyst Alphractal remarked that the BTC market seems to be getting ready for its next major move in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin Bull Score Index is giving signs of fading momentum, increasing risk of further downside. The Bitcoin market is also witnessing early signs of exhaustion, as asset manager BlackRock recently went on a BTC selling-spree, dumping about $500 million of the digital asset. Still, a number of analysts remain optimistic, with some forecasting a potential ATH of as high as $183,000 later this year. At press time, BTC trades at $109,841, down 1.8% in the past 24 hours.

Title: How Overworked CFOs Can Focus On What’s Most Important
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/cfo/2025/08/26/how-overworked-cfos-can-focus-on-whats-most-important/
Time Published: 2025-08-26T18:12:36Z

ByMegan Poinski, Forbes Staff andCFO, Forbes Staff. The U.S. has always tied the success of its companies to the success of the country to some degree. Last week, President Donald Trump made a literal connection between the two, brokering a deal for the U.S. to take a 10% stake in chipmaker Intel. With this deal, the federal government will be the third-largest stakeholder in the publicly traded company, with its 10% share only behind a pair of 13% stakes held by Blackrock and Vanguard. Intel had been promised close to $11 billion to support its manufacturing facilities through former President Joe Biden’s CHIPS Act. The equity stake is being cast as a redirection of those funds. While there is precedent for the government taking a stake in private companies, it’s generally only happened in times of widely recognized crisis. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the U.S. Treasury received stock warrants to prop up struggling commercial airlines—which were sold at an auction last year. During the Great Recession, the federal government purchased assets from failing banks to prevent a collapse of the financial system. And during Franklin D. Roosevelt’s presidency during the Great Depression, the federal government provided financial support for banks, railroads and other companies in danger of collapse. Intel, which was one of the world’s hottest companies during the PC boom in the ‘90s, has had a relatively slow spell, but it’s nowhere near the point of imminent collapse. CEO Lip-Bu Tan has been working to reinvigorate and refocus the chip maker since he took the helm in March, laying off employees, slowing down new facilities, and focusing on finding customers before increasing manufacturing capacity. Many policymakers and economists criticized Trump’s decision, saying it exposed the government to market risk, takes a step toward state-controlled industry and socialism, and is bringing unprecedented government intrusion into business. Trump dismissed those critics as “stupid,” and promised to make more deals like the one with Intel. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick identified defense contractor Lockheed Martin as a potential recipient in a Tuesday morning interview with CNBC. This is only the latest example of Trump’s involvement in the business sector. In June, he allowed Nippon Steel’s merger with U.S. Steel to proceed by claiming a “golden share” in the business, giving the federal government special powers over how the U.S. part of the company is run. Last month, the Defense Department became the largest shareholder in rare earth mining company MP Materials. And a deal he made with Nvidia and AMD to pay the U.S. government 15% of their revenue from chip sales to China came to light earlier this month. It’s clear that Trump does not follow a traditional governing playbook, but the administration’s heavier hand in business operations could impact both corporate bottom lines and the economy as a whole going forward. With other factors at play—including tariffs, interest rates, currency values and a potentially volatile stock market—the next three and a half years will be interesting for corporate finance. In today’s world, there are many things competing for the CFO’s attention, and it can be difficult to prioritize. I talked to Chris Sands, InvoiceCloud CFO, about how he drowns out the noise of everything else going on and harnesses the CFO’s ability to bring change to an organization. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. This is the published version of Forbes' CFO newsletter, which offers the latest news for chief finance officers and other leaders focused on the budget. Sign up here to get it delivered to your inbox every Tuesday. President Donald Trump has been very direct in his criticism of the Federal Reserve, which has held baseline interest rates steady at 4.25% to 4.5% since December. But on Monday night, he took his boldest step against the Fed yet, sending Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook a letter immediately firing her from her position. The letter, which Trump shared on his Truth Social platform, says that the president can remove governors for cause. Trump writes he believes Cook may have committed mortgage fraud, potentially making a false statement on a mortgage agreement. Cook has denied the accusation, and said in a statement shared with several news organizations that there is no cause under the law for her to be fired, and that the president has no authority to do so. She also said she will not resign, and will continue to serve out her term. Cook’s attorney Abbe Lowell said she will file a lawsuit challenging “this illegal action.” Experts say that Trump’s reasoning is legally dubious. Cook hasn’t been formally charged with a crime, hasn’t been given a chance to respond to accusations, and the alleged misconduct happened before Cook was confirmed to her Fed position, meaning the Senate and president could have vetted it during the advice and consent process. Previous Supreme Court rulings about firing members of independent boards found that they could only be fired for “inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.” Trump has been steadily attacking the Fed, and specifically Chairman Jerome Powell, since he took office. He reportedly weighed firing Powell outright, and is already searching for the person to succeed him when his term ends next year. Economists, scholars and critics told the Wall Street Journal that Trump’s actions put the U.S. into “uncharted waters,” since the Federal Reserve was designed to regulate financial policy outside of politics. Stocks have been volatile since Trump’s announcement regarding Cook, but are roughly unchanged from Monday. The irony is that the current Fed Governing Board may be poised to give Trump the interest rate cut he wants. At the Fed’s annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming last week, Powell said, “With policy in restrictive territory, the baseline outlook and the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance.” According to CME FedWatch, 87.3% of economists predict a 25-basis-point rate cut at the Fed’s meeting next month. The stock market has recently been on a tear, with the S&P 500’s total value up 83% in the last five years. But some wary investors are looking at the rapid rise and the big players, and envisioning a replay of the dotcom bubble a quarter century ago, writes Forbes’ Hank Tucker. Today, much like the late ‘90s, the IT sector makes up more than 33% of the S&P 500 index. And just like investors a quarter century ago bought up shares in internet companies, today’s investors are going all in on AI. Rob Arnott, founder and chairman of investment advisor Research Affiliates, told Tucker that today’s top companies tend to be great companies with great products, but bubbles burst when the margins are wrong—and they seem unrealistically optimistic around some of today’s high flyers. Last week, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told The Verge he thinks the AI market is in a bubble. Considering that Altman is one of the primary figures that started the boom, Forbes contributor Paulo Carvão writes, it’s worth heeding the warning. The wage gap between CEOs and workers at the 100 lowest-paying firms on the S&P 500 widened nearly 13% between 2019 and 2024, according to a new report from the Institute for Policy Studies. Starbucks had the largest gap—CEO Brian Niccol made $95.8 million last year, while the median pay for a worker was just $14,674. In the last five years, the report found that CEO pay at those companies increased 34.7%. Average median worker pay, on the other hand, was up just 16.3%. At 22 of those companies, median worker pay actually dropped since 2019. The report found that these wide salary gaps tend to widen gender and racial disparities at large, since many low wage workers are women and people of color, and few large companies have female or minority CEOs. There’s always a lot going on in today’s business world, and companies are counting on their CFOs to not only balance the books, but provide strategy to help them succeed going forward. Chris Sands, CFO at billing and payment solutions company InvoiceCloud, has focused on drowning out the noise that gets to the CFO’s office and concentrating on what’s the most important. I talked to him about how to find those functions and make sure that’s the work that a CFO does. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. What are some things that today’s CFOs are getting wrapped up in that are adding unnecessary complexity to their jobs? Sands: Using AI today as an example, it’s a very topical, very important, powerful technology that has a lot of implications. We’re an AI-forward organization, and there’s pressure on all of our leaders across the different functional areas to figure out what the best AI use cases are, how to adopt that, how to deploy that. But when I think about finance, and the use cases that exist today, and the maturity of the solutions out there to address it and the opportunity, it is not necessarily the area where I think there’s the most bang for the bucks. I think about how I use my time as a CFO. Is it better spent trying to be way ahead of the curve on AI use cases in the finance function, or figure out where, broadly across the business, we can deploy AI to get the biggest bang for the buck in the overall return on the business? I think it’s the latter, using my purview from the org as well as the skillset that comes with finance and FP&A and the like to help the org figure out how to best deploy AI, as opposed to becoming too myopic. I’d say most of the things that come across the desk are important, and there’s value in doing them, but there’s a finite amount of hours in the day. It’s all about how do you understand what’s most impactful, and then prioritize accordingly and follow through on that. If you’re not super disciplined about understanding what the most important drivers of the business are, prioritizing them and making progress on those, you could easily slip into spending too much time with less-impactful things, and that’s overall going to be bad for the business. What should the CFO’s priorities be? There’s a CFO that can tell you what’s going on in the business, and that’s probably an okay person. There’s a person that can tell you what’s going on and what should happen in the business, and that’s pretty good. The top tier would be people that can tell you what needs to happen in the business, and then go make it happen. I strive to be the top one. To me, the most important part of the job is understanding how the business works and what matters for the business. Being not just the custodian of the finance function, financial statements, board reporting and all of that, but being kind-of like the chief analyst of the business. Understanding for each business what makes it tick? Where are the opportunities? And then how do you make improvements against where those opportunities are? It starts there from there as you determine what the top priorities are, what the potential impact on the business is. How do you kind of ruthlessly prioritize and say no to other things? I find that to be the hardest part of it, because there’s always demands from different angles on how to spend the time, and things that need to be done in the business. Oftentimes, the biggest, most strategic things that are potentially needle-moving for the business don’t have a firm timeline or pressure coming from the board, CEO or others, so it’s easy to deprioritize those—but that is to the detriment of the business. By relentlessly prioritizing and following up, you’re much more likely to make sure you’re spending your time in the right way. Once you’ve identified where the opportunities are and what the business needs to do, how do you actually become a change agent? I find that the storytelling piece is maybe the hardest for folks with the finance DNA, just because it’s a little more creative and not necessarily typical for the profile. But by crafting the narrative around what’s important for the business—how to do it—and winning over the hearts and minds of colleagues and board is how you start to influence change. How can a CFO put together a finance department that reinforces the focus that they need to have? Having folks that are grounded in what they need to do, good at what they do, probably gets you 80%, 90% of the way there. The way you set goals and motivate the org is incredibly important. Most organizations go through annual goal setting, but setting up a framework to set goals that are achievable will help in sticking with those through the year. I think it helps keep people grounded. If all of a sudden, you’re just reacting to everything that’s coming up, you’re doing folks a disservice. Something I see all the time, especially in the private equity landscape, is a request comes down from the board and the CFO says, ‘I got this request. I don’t fully understand what exactly they want it for or what they’re looking for, but boy, are we going to blow them away with the analysis we’re going to do.’ As opposed to having the ability to interact with the board or CEO in and say, ‘Help me understand what it is you want to get to and what you’re after, and I’ll help you figure out the best way to get there.’ I find that is a huge stress reliever on the finance org, who typically comes up with all of these things falling in their lap. It just creates a ton of churn in the org. Having the ability to understand what matters, not just for the business, but to your investors, what they’re after and what you’re able to do to help them get what they need. That’s the No. 1 piece of advice I give to first-time CFOs in the private equity setting: Build that relationship and dynamic with the board and investors, so you’re not unnecessarily burdening and taxing your org. It just is exhausting for everyone, and it deludes from the focus on things that actually matter more for the business. Financial software can be vital to your company’s operations, but it can also make things less efficient and more costly. Here’s how you can take a look at what you have and try to make it work best for your company. (And no, that doesn’t mean just add AI.) It doesn’t matter if you agree with President Trump that “tariff” is the most beautiful word in the dictionary. They’re coming and will impact your business. If you’re a small business, here are three ways to prepare to keep your finances afloat as big changes are coming. This week, Keurig Dr Pepper announced its plans to acquire which beverage company?

Title: Banking On Financials - 3 Undervalued Bank Stocks
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnbuckingham/2025/08/26/banking-on-financials3-undervalued-bank-stocks/

ByJohn Buckingham, Contributor. The banking sector has hardly been on a smooth ride in recent years. Between rate volatility, regulatory uncertainty and heightened investor skepticism following the regional banking crisis of 2023, many bank stocks remain deeply discounted relative to their long-term earnings power. Yet when I look at the numbers today, I see plenty of reasons to be optimistic about what lies ahead. A terrific signal of confidence came in June, when the Federal Reserve released its annual Stress Test results. Even under a hypothetical scenario of 10% unemployment, a 50% equity market decline, and steep drops in commercial and residential real estate prices, the nation’s largest banks maintained capital levels well above regulatory minimums. That resilience has allowed management teams to raise dividends and restart or continue share repurchases. Let’s take a closer look at three names I believe are especially well-positioned today: U.S. Bancorp (USB) - USB has long been known for its conservative credit culture and steady fee income from payments, wealth management and mortgage banking. After a tough stretch, earnings are expected to rebound meaningfully, with EPS projected to grow from $3.98 in 2024 to $5.16 in 2027. Shares currently trade for less than 11x the estimate for the next 12 months, among the lowest in the large-cap bank group, while they yield a healthy 4.2%. With its broad Midwest and Western footprint, and strong partnerships with State Farm and Edward Jones, I see USB as a quality franchise available at an attractive price. PNC Financial (PNC) - PNC has leaned into its “brilliantly boring” brand, and the numbers for the large regional bank back it up. After a flat 2024, EPS is forecast to climb 10% in 2025 and another 12% in 2026, reaching $19 by 2027. At less than 11x forward earnings, the stock looks inexpensive relative to that trajectory. The dividend yield of 3.4% provides additional support, and with capital levels robust, I wouldn’t be surprised to see stepped-up buybacks in the coming quarters. I’m also encouraged by new leadership, as the addition of former BlackRock executive Mark Wiedman signals a greater emphasis on wealth and asset management integration—areas that could lift growth further. Bank OZK (OZK) - Smaller in size but no less impressive in execution, Arkansas-based regional bank OZK continues to deliver industry-leading profitability, supported by its Real Estate Specialties Group and conservative underwriting discipline. Earnings are expected to grow steadily, from $6.04 in 2024 to nearly $7.00 in 2027. Even after a strong run from the April lows, shares trade for only 8x estimated earnings, a deep discount for a bank with peer-leading returns on equity. The dividend yield stands at 3.4% and has grown at a double-digit rate over the past five years. Despite exposure to Commercial and Industrial lending, OZK offers a combination of conservative underwriting and a cost-conscious culture, as long-tenured management has long stressed credit discipline and risk-adjusted returns. Across these three institutions, I see a compelling mix of earnings momentum, strong capital positions, disciplined management and valuations that remain appealing. Inexpensive forward P/E ratios that we think should be higher and generous dividend yields compensating investors for their patience make for a compelling combination. No doubt, challenges remain as credit costs could rise and the policy backdrop is never static, but the combination of strong fundamentals and modest valuations makes me believe these banks should be included in a diversified portfolio of undervalued stocks. ***** For those who like what I have to say in this forum, further market analytics and stock picks can be found in my newsletter, The Prudent Speculator.

Skip to comments. Posted on 08/26/2025 9:35:10 AM PDT by Morgana President Donald Trump could not resist offering his opinion on the great Cracker Barrel rebrand debate, urging the iconic American restauranteur to capitalize on their negative publicity for maximum brand awareness. 'Cracker Barrel should go back to the old logo, admit a mistake based on customer response (the ultimate Poll), and manage the company better than ever before,' Trump said. Cracker Barrel ignited a firestorm of criticism on social media last week after it announced their decision to remove 'Uncle Hershel' from the company logo in favor of a more minimalist design. 'Uncle Herschel' is the real-life relative of the brand's founder Dan Evins. The old emblem showed him sitting on a chair in front of the famous cracker barrel. Republicans loudly protested the redesign, complaining it amounted to the abandonment of American values. Trump urged the company to leverage the controversy for maximum profits. 'They got a Billion Dollars worth of free publicity if they play their cards right,' he wrote. 'Very tricky to do, but a great opportunity.' He proposed that the company announce a major news conference to announce changes to the greatly criticized rebrand. (Excerpt) Read more at dailymail.co.uk ...

Who here thinks that ding bat CEO will listen to Trump's advice? Cracker Barrel is too mired in WOKE. Blackrock owns a major stake in the chain. They’ll never back down. The difference is Cracker Barrel’s business model is in big trouble. Sit down chain resstaurants serving real food are going extinct due to inflation and increased costs of business. In 1960 America I think the well established brands depended on a better advertising campaign to stir up product sales, they didn’t replace their well established brands, they just hired better advertising talent.

Title: Rumored Ripple NDA Suggests Trump, BlackRock, And JP Morgan Are Working With XRP Ledger

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Rumors are spreading fast in the crypto world after a supposed leaked NDA linked Ripple to big names like Trump, BlackRock, and JPMorgan. According to a post by Stellar Rippler on X, the XRP Ledger may have ties to projects that connect digital identity, healthcare, and global settlement systems. At the same time, BlackRock’s new ETF, Trump’s healthcare policy moves, and JPMorgan’s focus on digital identity appear to fit into the same plan. The story began when an ex-banker using the alias @LordBelgrave claimed he had leaked one of Ripple’s NDAs with UBS. Most of the details were already in circulation, but one shocking part stood out, a reference to “Biometric Identity Mapping.” This idea points to technology connecting personal identity with global financial systems. It goes far beyond what many assumed Ripple was building. According to the leak, Ripple may be developing tools that link digital identity with payments despite CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s earlier warnings about government control. At the time, most thought he was only talking about central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Healthcare already shows evidence of this. Wellgistics Health recently announced an XRP Ledger–based payment system that will serve 6,500 U.S. pharmacies. JPMorgan has already said that digital identity is the foundation of Web3. The World Economic Forum (WEF), describing how digital ID, compliance tracking, healthcare, and supply chains connect, promotes the same vision with its Blockchain Toolkit. Ripple’s involvement at high levels suggests it has a seat at the table. The leak looks even more critical when placed next to recent moves by global power players. BlackRock’s $XDNA ETF was launched on July 4th, the same day Trump pushed his “One Big Beautiful Bill” aimed at cutting healthcare costs. At the same time, Trump introduced his Digital Health Tech Ecosystem, while BlackRock’s ETF went live directly on the XRP Ledger. The timing makes it look like the moves are connected. JPMorgan continues to drive forward with digital identity projects that match what Ripple is building. Ripple’s DNA Protocol connects to healthcare, identity, and payments, and tries to bring these systems onto the blockchain. Ripple’s deals in Africa and the MENA region could not have happened randomly. Deals with Chipper Cash and Onafriq, plus DNA Protocol onboarding labs in African nations, show Ripple is not expanding randomly but appears to be using a targeted adoption strategy to spread the new system globally. Finally, photos of Brad Garlinghouse standing with leaders from the IMF, SWIFT, and Christine Lagarde raise a big question: was Ripple always meant to be the chosen rail for the coming identity-health-finance merger? The rumored NDA, combined with these strategic moves, leads many in the crypto world to believe the answer could be yes.

Yet, according to experts, this revolutionary potential raises profound concerns, from surgical risks and device failures to deeper ethical questions about identity, autonomy, data ownership, algorithmic bias, and accessibility. In August, Noland Arbaugh, the first recipient of a Neuralink brain implant, revealed the technology had transformed his life 18 months after surgery. Arbaugh was left paralysed below the shoulders following a swimming accident that dislocated two vertebrae, and underwent the procedure in 2024. The Neuralink chip in his brain connects over 1,000 electrodes to his neurons, reads and decodes his brain’s electrical signals, translating them into digital commands. Dr Anusheel Munshi, MD (PGI Chandigarh), DNB(Gold Medal), MNAMS, Principal Director and Head, Radiation Oncology, BLK MAX Hospital, New Delhi, explained that these devices can connect computers to brains and hold transformative potential for medicine, promising breakthroughs in treating neurological disorders like paralysis, epilepsy, and Alzheimer’s. By enabling direct communication between the brain and machines, they could restore lost functions and revolutionise neuroprosthetics. These devices can potentially increase human memory and intelligence by a quantum leap. “Neuralink’s claims are ambitious and increasingly realisable, being grounded in credible neuroscience research for decades, but far from being comprehensive. The company’s ‘Telepathy’ implant has already enabled participants to control computers and smartphones purely by thought. These are not just proof-of-concept demonstrations; patients like Arbaugh are reporting sustained, meaningful improvements in quality of life over many months,” Lakshay Sahni, the co-founder & CTO, Marbles Health, said. He continued that the human brain is too intricate for a “one-interface-fits-all” solution. While the technology can be revolutionary for conditions such as paralysis or locked-in syndrome, in disorders like depression, anxiety, addiction, and Alzheimer’s, the evidence remains speculative. With risk inherent in every neurosurgical implant, infection, scar tissue (gliosis), device malfunction, and the need for replacement surgeries are genuine medical concerns. Psychological risks include the possibility of a permanent brain implant altering a person’s sense of self or identity. Other ethical questions include algorithmic bias in decision-making, shared accountability for interventions, equitable access to such life-changing tools, and the long-term implications for human identity and autonomy. Alongside, non-invasive brain technologies are already available to several patients. The FDA has approved Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to treat depression, whereas transcranial Electrical Stimulation (tES) devices have been approved in India for various neuropsychiatric disorders. None of the methods requires surgery and can be safely offered in outpatient clinics, and in some cases, even at home. In India, several startups have efforts focused on non-invasive BCIs. Marbles Health is a medically approved startup for portable neuromodulation for psychiatric conditions such as depression, anxiety, addiction, and ADHD. These technologies are safer, more affordable, and scalable within the Indian healthcare system. Sid Das, the co-founder of eGenome, an AI-powered platform for analysing genomic data, shared that non-intrusive, AI-driven technologies like its own eGenome.ai can already reverse up to 99% of disorders by decoding biomarkers, predicting risks early, and guiding precision interventions tailored to each individual. “Unlike surgical interfaces, they are safer, scalable, and accessible, allowing for broad adoption without exposing patients to unnecessary risks. In cases where non-intrusive methods may not suffice, brain-computer interfaces such as Neuralink can still hold promise at the margins. But our priority is harnessing non-invasive, precision AI diagnostics to deliver personalised care at scale, striving for 100% curability,” he said. Alongside, Neuralink-related surgeries are a tens-of-thousands-of-dollars endeavour, and only a few in the U.S. currently have access to the technology. The timeline from discovery to an accessible standard of care is lengthy, and equitable access will likely pose an obstacle. On the other hand, non-invasive brain health devices that are portable, clinic-ready, and safe will remain the opening to accessibility for the next decade. The technology is still expensive and limited even in the U.S., so widespread adoption in India will take time. “Building another Neuralink in India faces hurdles like cost, infrastructure, investment, regulatory, talent gaps, and patient acceptance. While India is unlikely to see a “copycat Neuralink” soon, maybe it should not. The country is positioned to lead in scalable, non-invasive brain health technologies that can reach millions. Instead of replicating Neuralink’s invasive path, India’s opportunity may be to complement it, developing accessible, approved, non-invasive neurotech solutions,” the Marbles Health co-founder said.

Organizations are prioritizing seamless, user-friendly digital environments to boost employee engagement, productivity, and satisfaction. Businesses are increasingly moving away from legacy systems to cloud-based workplace models that support hybrid work, enable real-time collaboration, and simplify IT service delivery. Companies are also deploying AI-powered service desks and automation to reduce response times and improve support efficiency, making the workplace more responsive and employee-focused. Trend: AI-driven Employee Experience Platforms AI-driven employee experience platforms are reshaping how organizations support their workforce by delivering personalized, intelligent services. Infosys, through its Infosys Wingspan platform, leverages AI to provide customized learning paths, foster collaboration, and offer performance insights tailored to employee roles and goals. TCS has developed Ignio, an AI-led cognitive automation solution that helps streamline employee services, from IT support to HR workflows. These platforms analyze behavioral data to recommend actions that improve productivity and well-being. For instance, Infosys uses AI-powered tools to proactively address employee concerns, enhancing satisfaction and retention. This reflects a growing shift toward intelligent, experience-centric workplace services. Digital workplace market in the US The digital workplace market in the US is evolving rapidly as enterprises shift toward hybrid work models and cloud-first strategies. Large organizations across industries such as healthcare, finance, and manufacturing are investing in digital workplace services to enhance collaboration, streamline IT support, and improve employee engagement. In May 2024, TCS expanded its Smart Workplace offerings for US clients, integrating AI-driven service desks and personalized digital experience monitoring. Infosys has also deepened its presence in the US through localized digital transformation hubs, helping enterprises modernize employee services using cloud and analytics. Enterprises are increasingly focusing on experience-level agreements (XLAs) rather than traditional service-level agreements (SLAs), emphasizing employee satisfaction and productivity. The growing demand for seamless digital onboarding, virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI), and enterprise mobility is pushing service providers to deliver more tailored and responsive workplace solutions. This transformation reflects how US businesses are rethinking workforce enablement and digital service delivery. By organization size, the SMEs segment is expected to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast period. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have become the most active consumers of digital workplace services as they require scalable and economically viable services to support the dynamic business requirements. SMEs do not have as many legacy systems as large enterprises, so they can be more responsive to cloud-based digital workplace tools. Remote collaboration, endpoint management, and security without the burden of operating complex in-house IT systems are becoming top priorities for these organizations. The SMEs are being pursued by vendors with streamlined service packages that encompass a unified communication platform, device provisioning, support services, and employee experience tools, and they are provided as managed services. It is attractive because of predictable pricing, rapid implementation, and the ability to scale services as business needs increase or workforce models change. Providers who provide localized services and industry-specific customization are also valued by SMEs, particularly within retail, professional services, and education markets. With digital workplace solutions becoming increasingly modular and service-driven, SMEs enjoy the same functionality previously available to large enterprises, including automated help desks, monitoring on experience levels, and cloud desktops. Inquire Before Buying: https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Enquiry_Before_BuyingNew.asp?id=81457101 By vertical, the BFSI segment is estimated to have the largest market share during the global forecast. The BFSI sector leads the digital workplace services market due to its focus on modernization, security, and employee-centric transformation. In April 2024, Wipro implemented an AI-powered digital workplace platform for Allianz, a leading European insurance company, automating over 60% of IT helpdesk interactions and streamlining service delivery. Cognizant partnered with BlackRock in June 2024 to deploy a cloud-native virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) and intelligent automation, enhancing secure remote access for investment teams across regions. IBM collaborated with BNP Paribas in January 2025 to implement its digital workplace framework integrated with Watson AI, significantly reducing incident resolution times and delivering predictive insights on IT asset utilization. These examples show how BFSI firms are actively investing in scalable and intelligent digital workplace ecosystems to support remote operations, maintain compliance, and boost workforce efficiency. Opportunity: Integration with digital twin and IoT technologies The integration of digital twin and IoT technologies presents a significant opportunity in the digital workplace services market, particularly for industries seeking real-time operational insights. In March 2025, TCS collaborated with Siemens to implement a digital workplace solution integrated with digital twin models for a major European automotive manufacturer. This enabled remote monitoring of production lines and predictive maintenance using IoT sensor data. Infosys, in partnership with PTC, deployed an IoT-enabled smart workplace solution in January 2024 for a global energy enterprise, connecting employee devices with industrial assets to improve workspace efficiency and safety. HCLTech has also partnered with IBM to offer digital twin-powered workplace solutions that simulate facility usage and support proactive infrastructure management. These collaborations demonstrate how technology and service providers are combining strengths to build intelligent workplace environments that are more adaptive, predictive, and efficient, marking a shift toward experiential and insight-driven employee ecosystems.

A business journal from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania Wharton’s Shimon Kogan unpacks the behavioral and economic dynamics behind token value, investor psychology, and the rise of meme coins in this special series on the “Future of Finance.” Itay Goldstein Itay Goldstein Listen to the podcast. What determines whether a cryptocurrency succeeds or fades into obscurity? In this episode, Wharton professor Itay Goldstein speaks with Shimon Kogan, adjunct associate professor of finance at Wharton and longtime instructor of Wharton’s fintech course, to explore the economic and behavioral forces behind token success. From network effects and user adoption to coordination challenges and the phenomenon of meme coins, this conversation dives into the mechanics of tokenomics and what drives value in the world of fintech. This discussion is part of a special series called “Future of Finance: The Rise of Crypto and Digital Money.” Listen to this episode on Spotify or Apple Podcasts. Itay Goldstein: Welcome everyone. This is the Future of Finance series. This is our second season, and we are talking about digital assets, cryptocurrencies, tokens, decentralized finance, and everything related to that space. I am Itay Goldstein, professor of finance here at Wharton, and I’m currently the chair of the finance department. We are going to devote this episode to thinking about the economics of tokenization. This is a term that is now known as tokenomics. We’re going to try to understand what are the fundamental forces that are driving the market for tokens and coins, and how these forces are different from some of the other markets, financial assets that we are used to and that we have been thinking about in the past. I have the perfect guest today to think about those issues. Shimon Kogan has been with us at Wharton for the last 10 years or so, teaching the fintech course. He was one of the first movers into the area of fintech when few places had fintech courses. He already designed one and came to teach it for us, and has been doing it since then with great success. He also worked on related issues in his own research, and we are going to talk about that as well. Welcome Shimon. It’s great to have you. Let’s dive right in and try to understand some of the terms that we are talking about. Can you help us understand, what do we think about when we think about tokens and coins? What are the common uses for them? How are they potentially going to change the financial system? A lot of it is maybe just a pipe dream, things that we are aspiring to but have not been realized yet. How much is real and how much is still just a fantasy? Shimon Kogan: I’ll try to deliver on that, at least at a high level, because I’m sure that we’re going to dive into some of the more specifics during the conversation. But the top is a good place to start because there are lots of terms in this field and it gets quite confusing. In the world of crypto, I think it’s important to distinguish between different class of assets, because it tells you something about the underlying technology and the underlying structure. At the core level, we have cryptocurrencies. And each of these cryptocurrencies is associated with a particular blockchain. [For example,] bitcoin is the blockchain protocol. BTC is the native currency for that. Here as well, I think it’s helpful to distinguish between transactional only blockchains like bitcoin or litecoin, where the primary use case of the coin, aside for paying for the security, but the primary use case in these kinds of blockchains is payments. We want to separate that from the second generation, if you will, of blockchains, and those are programmable blockchains like ethereum, solana, and many other competitors where the primary use case of the native digital coin is to pay for the execution of smart contracts. So, we have cryptocurrencies as the main type of asset. Now, notice that when we talk about cryptocurrencies, because each of them is native to its own blockchain, you cannot take bitcoin and transact in ethereum and vice versa without some third-party offering, kind of like bridge services. We can talk about that if you’re interested. Now, on programmable blockchains, there are lots of things you can do. As it turns out, you can create tokens. We want to distinguish between, again, the cryptocurrency like ethereum and tokens that live on ethereum. These are assets that are created by applications around various use cases. Some of them could be payments for services, could be voting, could be control. We’ll come back to when we talk about tokenomics. The fact that this sort of Turing complete programming language means that you can create lots and lots of different varieties of contracts, and we see that in practice. That also introduces vulnerability. Many of my examples are going to be from ethereum because it’s simply the largest programmable blockchain. They created templates of types of tokens just to make developer’s life easier, so you don’t have to figure out from scratch all the features and open yourself up to security vulnerabilities. You may be familiar with ERC-20, which is the fungible token standard that was behind the ICO boom, or heavily used during the ICO boom. We have ERC-721 tokens. That’s the template oftentimes used in nonfungible tokens. More recently, we have ERC-1400, which now advances as a format to offer tokenization of off-chain assets. Again, we have cryptocurrencies and we have tokens. Now, those tokens inherent the security of the blockchain on which they were developed. So as a developer, you have to ask yourself where you want to develop your application and where these tokens are going to live. Because, again, they don’t port from one protocol to another. Naturally, there’s a lot of competition around kind of eyeballs and attention of developers by these, what we call layer ones, by these programmable blockchains. Goldstein: But if you want to think about the main economic uses for them, how would you classify that? Kogan: The first is, and that’s a very specific type of token, but it’s so specific that has its own name, and those are stablecoins, right? Stablecoins are tokens that are designed to keep a peg to, typically, the U.S. dollar, but could be, in principle, anything. It’s a big business. Circle went public, went from like $30 to $200 overnight. It’s a real big business. There’s another big business around and some real traction around tokenization, because that’s the idea of representing non-crypto native assets on crypto infrastructure, blockchain infrastructure. BlackRock, for example, partnered with Securitize to offer its money market fund, Biddle. That was the relative success. Goldstein: What you’re saying is taking financial assets and putting them on token. What is the advantage of doing that? Kogan: There could be few advantages. First of all, what you get is instantaneous settlement. Even if you’re an institutional player, once you have stablecoins and you have these crypto-native securities, or representation of them, then you have 24/7 instantaneous settlement, which we still don’t have even if you’re a large sort of corporation. If you’re moving money about a settlement, it takes time, depending on what kind of asset you’re looking at. But obviously, the ambition is much bigger than that. RobinHood announced that they’re going to offer tokens associated with private equity. So, they’re going to take, I don’t know, SpaceX, and OpenAI, etc., and represent them as tokens. People are talking about what’s called tokenizing real-world assets. Those are not securities at all. This could be anything from collectibles to real estate. Goldstein: It allows us to trade on things that otherwise we wouldn’t be able to trade. And things that we could trade, it allows us to do it more efficiently? Kogan: That’s right. Look, this is not a [panacea]. I have a lot of conversations with people in the industry about this. I think [there are] the parts of it that makes sense, [and] the parts of it that people are not thinking carefully through. Like, for example, there are fundamental reasons why some of these assets are illiquid. That illiquidity I don’t think is going to go away by creating a digital representation and offering people to trade it 24/7. That’s not a solution to the fundamental problem that causes these assets to be non-tradable. I’ll take the other side of this, but you can take assets that have a fairly infrequent price discovery, and you’re still not going to solve the problem of that price being stale. Again, this is not a fiction, this is happening. You can allow owners of these assets to pledge them as collateral, and that could be a partial solution for the liquidity problem. I have an asset that you have a hard time valuing, and you’re saying, “Look, I don’t know if it’s worth $80 or $90 or $100, but the probability that it’s worth less than $20 is very low. If you lock this asset in a smart contract, I’ll lend you $20 against this, with appropriate interest.” I think it’s an interesting solution of — kind of indirect way of giving some liquidity and by making these assets, at the very least, legible. Goldstein: When we are thinking about tokenomics, the economics of tokens, we would like to understand supply, demand, how prices are formed. If we are thinking about other financial assets, like stocks, I think we have very well-established frameworks. You’re thinking about future earnings, future cash flows, you’re discounting them, and so on. Those rules are not working exactly like that when it comes to tokens, and this is what makes the economics a little richer and more interesting. What do you think are the other forces, and how should we think about the economics here? Kogan: It’s a good question. First of all, let me say that it should be obvious from our channel so far that this flexibility allows us to create all sorts of tokens with lots of different features. I think one of the challenges of this industry is that there’s very little theory and not that much of an empirical work from academia to guide, say, new platform builders for how do their structure. They often come and ask these questions like, “How should I control supply? What is the emission rate, burn rate?” Basically, the dimensions along which they have choices are quite broad. I think that there’s more that we don’t understand about optimal contract design, if you will, in the context of tokenomics than we do. That’s my personal opinion on this. Now, I think it’s helpful to draw parallels to equities. There are some similarities and some differences. They look a little bit like each other because both, under some circumstances, give you some control rights and ownership rights, and some of them, although they don’t declare that, give you some cash flow rights. But let’s understand what world each of these live in. In the world of securities or equities, essentially what you have is a legal structure that safeguards the holders of securities against exposed bad behavior by managers or controls. Obviously, you do not have that legal protection when it comes to tokens, at least not under the current legal framework. What you do have with tokens is the ability to what we call pre-commit. What you can do, for example, with tokens, that you cannot do with equities, is to say, “I’m going to program in the rate by which new tokens are going to be issued, and it’s going to be a function of these conditions.” Take bitcoin, for example. It’s purely a condition. Like, it’s function of time, right? The price of bitcoin doesn’t affect the mission of bitcoin, how many miners there are. They don’t matter. That’s a particular choice that you can do in crypto world that you cannot easily implement with equities. Goldstein: This leads me to something related that people would think maybe is on the fringe but is getting a lot of attention, which is meme coins. You have coins that are kind of based on nothing. If you think about dogecoin or shiba inu, others, you basically have a token that has value just because other people think it has value and not because it represents anything that is underlying it that would be valuable. Would you think about that also using the same framework, or do you think this is something completely different? Kogan: I think that’s a good question. If you want to be provocative, you can ask whether bitcoin is a meme coin as well, right? Goldstein: Do you think that bitcoin is a meme coin? Kogan: No, I personally don’t, but — Goldstein: No, because at least with bitcoin, at the beginning, there was this idea that it’s going to be a new currency people are going to use it to buy things, and so on. I don’t think it really panned out this way so far, but there were some use cases. Kogan: Absolutely. I’m not suggesting that bitcoin is meme coin. All I’m saying is that if you take a few steps back and look from high-level perspective, you can ask yourself, what is the tangible utility? You’re absolutely right. By the way, with some of the meme coins, the process was kind of fake-it-until-you-make-it, in some sense. I don’t think it was designed. But, dogecoin now, Elon Musk is suggesting that it’s going to be the payment rail maybe for X. You have now kind of a mini-ecosystem around shiba inu. Again, I don’t think it was there in the first place. And I do think that there’s a lot of other factors at play here that are more coming from behavioral finance than anything else, in terms of thinking about valuation. I do want to mention something that we found, that I think is relevant for this discussion, in a paper where we had access to a really interesting dataset from eToro. EToro is a publicly traded company. It’s basically a retail broker that has operations in over 100 markets. One of the neat features of eToro is that from the get-go they offered retail investors the ability to invest in lots of different types of assets. They were one of the first to actually embrace crypto. The question we asked was really simple. Do people seem to behave different in cryptos than in, say, equities or gold? We wanted to ask that very simple question. More specifically, what we’re interested in is how expectations of future returns of these asset classes actually respond to prices, which is kind of what you’re getting at, right? Under some assumptions, what we can do is back out the share in the portfolio for users dedicated to each of these asset classes, and you can estimate how these portfolio shares respond to past returns. Very robust finding, right? Lots of different specifications. We find that when you look at equities and people have retail investors, in our sample, have contrarian beliefs. Equity prices go up, people believe that future returns are going to be lower than they were before. By the way, that’s true for gold as well, but not for crypto. So, they appear to have kind of momentum, like beliefs in crypto, and we try to understand where it’s coming from. For example, we looked at whether people have momentum beliefs when you focus on lottery-like stocks, those are stocks that have positive skewness. Maybe young stocks, smaller ones. There are various known proxies for this. And interestingly, we don’t find that. We still find contrarian beliefs, even in these lottery-like stocks. So, there’s something specific about crypto. Goldstein: This is the role of adoption and coordination, I think. This speaks very clearly to that. You say this can also support meme coins that might not have any underlying value, but the value is just coming from the fact that others are using it? Kogan: That’s true, although I think that with meme coins it’s a very extreme case because there’s not even a pretense. I think it’s for regulatory reasons, right? Part of it, I think, started as a way of avoiding being classified as a security. There’s no pretense of anything underpinning its value. It’s a very kind of extreme case of not where we push fundamentals to the future, where we have no fundamentals at all. There are some really interesting studies done in the ‘70s and ’80s looking at experimental markets where they tried to do this. They tried to see what happens when you push fundamentals further out into the future, and they found two things that could be actually relevant for these markets. They found that, first of all, you can create these bubbles in a lab, in a very controlled, very simple environment, in a reputable way. They found that expectations are adaptive. When these bubbles happen and you ask traders what they think the price is going to happen, many of them understand that prices get detached from fundamentals. But these fundamentals are not going to show up until later in the future, so they exhibit these adaptive expectations. The second thing is that they underestimate how quickly the bubble will burst, on average. Because it’s clear that, because there’s something anchoring prices. Goldstein: There is some parallel also to meme stocks, right? In the previous season, I talked to Matt Levine about meme stocks and social behavior in the financial market, and clearly that is a very strong force here as well. Maybe even more extreme, because with meme stocks, there is a grain of fundamental, whereas here there isn’t. These are maybe the same underlying forces, bit even more extreme that we see them here in tokenomics. Kogan: I agree. With GameStop, AMC, you would think that at some point there are fundamentals that are going to anchor the price of a stock with meme coins. It’s not obvious what that anchor is. I think they really lean on similar drivers for users, this sense of community, shared narrative, in some cases, this idea that they are collectively rebelling against traditional powers. I think that’s very important to note as well, and we see this elsewhere. There’s a great appetite for gambling. Goldstein: I want to go back a little bit to ICO, initial coin offerings. A few years ago, there was a wave of ICOs, and I think at that point there was hope that there is real economic value behind it. Because those are firms that, instead of issuing equity, they are issuing coins, and that is a way to raise capital and also supports the products of the firms. But unfortunately, there was also a lot of fraud associated with that, and then it came to halt. Now, there’s a lot of regulatory uncertainty where it’s going to go. Where do you think we are headed with that? You think there is still a future for this? Kogan: I very much agree with your assessment, but I also want to point out that there are some legitimate platforms that were built around that. Goldstein: Yeah, absolutely. There were some of them that were certainly legitimate, but there was also a lot of fraudulent ones around them. And the fact that it was hard to tell which is which, I think this is what caused the crash in activity. Kogan: I agree. It was sort of combination of that. And it kind of coincided, roughly around the same time, with the Terra Luna debacle, the FTX, Celsius. There are a bunch of notable cases of what you would legally or otherwise probably classify as fraud. That led to an obvious response by the regulator, the SEC. I think the regulatory environment now looks very different in the U.S., and I think that’s worth mentioning, and I think there’s hope that under that new framework there will be ways in which you can actually do this with proper disclosure and guidelines and consumer protection. That’s what we’re concerned about. The audience may be familiar with the GENIUS Act, which is standing for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoin Act. It’s basically a framework for, how do you issue payment stablecoins, etc.? Again, I’m happy to talk more about that if you’re interested. And there’s another, even more ambitious and broader attempt to clarify what is a security, what is a commodity — under the Clarity Act — and provide safe harbor to developers, and establish market rules, and compliance rules, etc. These two may get combined eventually, and that’s part of the political discussion that’s taking place right now. We see very different frameworks slightly, but we see Europe being a bit ahead of the U.S. in that way through MiCA framework. It doesn’t cover everything, but it’s quite comprehensive and talks about guidelines for how you issue tokens and stable coins, and what custody services look like, etc. I think that, yes, in the U.S. — I think everywhere, right? We’ve seen some regulatory lag, because the industry moves very, very quickly. It’s fascinating to see how quickly the evolution cycles in this industry are. There are some legitimate issues around that, or concerns around regulatory capture and regulatory arbitrage. I work as an expert witness for a number of crypto-related cases, and I see how the level of understanding on the supervisory and regulatory side, it’s very different from what it was a few years ago. There’s catching up to do, but I’m hopeful that it’s happening, and I think that this can actually lead to, at least from an entrepreneur’s perspective, a more sensible framework that’s based on activity and not based on type of institution.

Title: Can ADA rally to $1.20 despite SEC’s latest Cardano ETF delay?

Time Published: 2025-08-26T13:00:19Z

Will Cardano, XRP, and PENGU ETFs finally break through, or stay trapped in regulatory limbo? The SEC has postponed its review of the Cardano ETF until the 26th of October, extending delays on multiple altcoin products. ADA, XRP, and PENGU continue to feel the pressure of regulatory delays. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has once again paused its review of the proposed Cardano [ADA] exchange-traded fund (ETF). It extended the decision deadline from the 27th of August to the 26th of October 2025. The move adds Cardano to the growing roster of altcoin ETF applications facing regulatory delays, as the agency continues to take a cautious approach toward approving new crypto investment products. If approved, the Cardano ETF would allow investors to access ADA through a regulated vehicle, eliminating the need to hold the cryptocurrency directly. The SEC’s latest delay has fueled speculation about how an eventual approval or denial could shape Cardano’s market trajectory. In fact, BlackRock has not yet sought a Cardano ETF; its existing Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH] products have already attracted billions in inflows and lifted market prices. If BlackRock pursued an ADA-backed product, the token could rally toward $1.20, based on Fibonacci extension levels. For Cardano, the outcome of this review carried significant weight. A greenlight would mark a major step in boosting ADA’s accessibility for mainstream investors through traditional brokerages. On top of that, growing institutional recognition is already evident, with Cardano recently climbing in Grayscale’s asset rankings. By contrast, a rejection would be a setback for Grayscale and other firms seeking regulated exposure to the cryptocurrency. The SEC emphasized that the extension is intended to provide more time for a comprehensive evaluation of the proposal, echoing its cautious stance toward other crypto-related applications. Needless to say, this is not an isolated case. Alongside Cardano, the regulator has also delayed its decisions on the Canary PENGU and WisdomTree Ripple [XRP] ETFs, both of which are now slated for a ruling by the 12th of October. By then, the SEC must either approve, reject, or initiate formal disapproval proceedings. The ripple effects of the SEC’s cautious stance are already being felt in the market. ADA slipped 5.15% to $0.8389, XRP dropped 1.73% to $2.91, and PENGU fell 5.59% to $0.03054 over the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. Ripple’s August 2025 legal win cleared the way for new spot ETF filings from Grayscale and Franklin Templeton. Still, the path forward remained uncertain. Under new SEC Chair Paul Atkins, and with crypto laws on the horizon, optimism for approval rose. Yet risks remained.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs post $219 million rebound while Ethereum funds attract twice the inflows

Fidelity and BlackRock drive $219 million rebound for Bitcoin ETFs, but Ethereum continues to shine. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States ended a difficult run of redemptions with their first day of inflows in more than a week. According to Coinperps data, the products collectively drew $219 million on Aug. 25, marking a shift in investor sentiment after six consecutive trading sessions of withdrawals. This rebound was led by Fidelity, BlackRock, and Ark 21Shares, which each attracted over $60 million. Fidelity’s FBTC logged the largest daily intake at $65.6 million, followed by BlackRock’s IBIT with $63.4 million and Ark’s ARKB with $61.2 million. Smaller allocations flowed into Bitwise’s BITB ($15.2 million), Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust ($7.3 million), and VanEck’s HODL ($6.3 million). Meanwhile, ETFs offered by Invesco, Valkyrie, WisdomTree, and Franklin Templeton registered no new capital on the day. The return of positive flows comes after a bruising stretch in mid-August. Between Aug. 15 and Aug. 22, the group of funds shed roughly $1.2 billion, reflecting a wave of profit-taking and caution among institutional holders. So, this reversal suggests that some investors are seeing renewed opportunity in Bitcoin despite its recent loss of momentum. Meanwhile, Ethereum products continued to overshadow Bitcoin ETFs in terms of investor demand. On the same day, spot Ethereum ETFs attracted $443.9 million in net inflows, more than double their BTC counterparts’ total. BlackRock’s ETHA dominated with $314.9 million, while Fidelity’s FETH drew $87.4 million. Smaller contributions came from Grayscale’s Mini Ethereum Trust and offerings by Bitwise, 21Shares, and Invesco, adding about $17 million together. The strong showing follows a turbulent prior week when Ethereum ETFs saw outflows equivalent to 105,000 ETH, breaking a multi-week streak of steady demand. Glassnode data indicates that the tide has turned again, with institutions adding back 16,900 ETH at the start of this week. The split in flows highlights how investor positioning is evolving in the current market conditions. Bitcoin ETFs are showing early signs of stabilization after heavy redemptions, while Ethereum funds are attracting stronger conviction in the short term. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: Why Everyone Is Buying Bitcoin, And What You Need To Know

ByBecca Bratcher, Contributor. Bitcoin’s appeal has shifted between speculation, ideology, and innovation. But in 2025, the reasons for owning the world’s first decentralized digital currency appear more rooted in macroeconomics and politics than ever before. Inflation data continues to plague households, job markets face an uncertain future shaped by AI’s rapid expansion, and a growing divide in perspectives over the U.S. dollar’s direction. Against this backdrop, Bitcoin’s narrative as “hard money” is becoming clear. This article examines three converging forces, persistent inflation, economic stagnation, and political uncertainty, that are driving renewed demand for Bitcoin. July 2025’s inflation report showed consumer prices landing just under the Federal Reserve’s target, despite the added pressure of tariffs. While the month’s figures suggest some progress, longer-term data show inflation trending higher over time. For households, that continued upward slope means costs for essentials such as groceries, energy, and housing remain elevated, underscoring the ongoing challenge for policymakers. For investors, inflation diminishes the purchasing power of traditional savings. Cash in the bank is worth less tomorrow than today. This reality has revived interest in scarce assets that can hold value over time. Historically, gold served this role, but Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million coins offers a modern alternative. Unlike fiat currencies, which can be expanded through central bank policy, Bitcoin’s issuance is predetermined by code. Economist Saifedean Ammous often describes this feature as “hard money.” A system resistant to inflationary debasement. Ammous argues that in an era of rising deficits, ballooning government spending, and a Federal Reserve still wielding extraordinary influence over markets, digital scarcity offers reassurance. Institutional adoption further supports this narrative. Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, launched in the U.S. in 2024, have attracted billions in inflows, making it easier for retirement accounts, pensions, and retail investors alike to gain exposure. Another factor driving Bitcoin interest is less about money and more about work. 2025 labor-market data show slowing job creation, with wage growth struggling to keep pace with living costs. AI’s acceleration adds another layer of uncertainty. From automated call centers to AI-driven logistics, companies are investing heavily in efficiency. While AI adoption may boost productivity in the long run, it also raises questions about displacement and stagnant pay in the short term. The extent to which AI directly suppresses job growth is difficult to determine, but the perception of instability is real. This sense of economic unease has fueled interest in money perceived as both “hardest” and most accessible. Bitcoin, unlike stocks or bonds, does not require a brokerage account or financial advisor. It is open-source, borderless, and available to anyone with internet access. In uncertain times, accessibility matters. For younger generations, Bitcoin is not just an investment but a parallel system outside traditional financial gatekeepers. In a survey by Bank of America, people age 44 or younger consistently rank Bitcoin and other digital assets as preferred long-term holdings. The logic is straightforward. If the job market no longer guarantees stability, building resilience through alternative assets becomes a personal strategy. Politics can shape how economic challenges are perceived. President Donald Trump has repeatedly faulted the Federal Reserve for America’s financial strains, arguing that its interest rate policies have weakened confidence in the dollar. Against this backdrop, the divide is clear. some investors turn to Bitcoin as a hedge outside government control. Taken together, these forces, chronic inflation, job market anxiety, and political division, are creating momentum for Bitcoin. What was once a niche interest has entered mainstream financial conversations. ETF commercials run on prime-time television, professional athletes request salaries in Bitcoin, and major corporations continue to hold it on their balance sheets. However, Bitcoin’s volatility is not trivial. Prices continue to reach new highs, but can fall just as quickly. Investors must balance its potential as “hard money” with the reality that its market is still in infancy. Yet the trajectory of its adoption signals underlying strength. Each cycle of volatility brings new participants who hold through the turbulence, strengthening its base. As with gold in the 1970s or internet stocks in the 1990s, Bitcoin is moving from fringe asset to fixture in the global financial system. The question of why everyone is buying Bitcoin in 2025 has no single answer. It reflects a convergence of forces as inflation erodes savings, job stagnation challenges household stability, and political division raises doubts about the dollar’s future. For some, Bitcoin represents a hedge against inflation. For others, it is a tool of financial independence in an uncertain job market. And for many, it is an escape from political and institutional distrust. Together, these motivations create a powerful narrative of Bitcoin as hard money for uncertain times.

Skip to comments. Posted on 08/25/2025 6:33:00 PM PDT by SeekAndFind Fox Business’s Larry Kudlow expressed concern on Friday over the Trump administration’s move to take a 10 percent stake in mega chipmaker Intel. “I am very, very uncomfortable with that idea. I’m very uncomfortable with that one, but that’s a conversation for another meal on another day,” Kudlow told economist Stephen Moore, in an interview highlighted by Mediate. Moore himself, a Trump economic adviser, earlier in the appearance, also criticized the administration’s decision, calling it “terrible.” “I hate corporate welfare. That’s privatization in reverse. We want the government to divest of assets, not buy assets. So terrible, one of the bad ideas that’s come out of this White House,” Moore told Kudlow, who served under President Trump as the director of the National Economic Council during his first term. Trump on Friday announced that the U.S. government now owns 10 percent of Intel shares. “The United States paid nothing for these Shares, and the Shares are now valued at approximately $11 Billion Dollars. This is a great Deal for America and, also, a great Deal for INTEL. Building leading edge Semiconductors and Chips, which is what INTEL does, is fundamental to the future of our Nation. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” he wrote on social media. (Excerpt) Read more at thehill.com ...

Title: 11 Investment Must Reads for This Week (Aug. 26, 2025)

Full Content:
Growth in the use of ETFs and SMAs is changing how muni portfolios are constructed, reports Bond Buyer. Morningstar gives investors a closer look at potential pitfalls of using funds of funds. These are among the investment must-reads we found this week for financial advisors. August 25, 2025 ETF and SMA Growth Is Reshaping How Muni Portfolios Are Built and Managed “At The Bond Buyer's Buy-Side Summit, panelists from BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, Invesco, and BAM Mutual explore how demand for customization, transparency, and active strategies is transforming the muni fund landscape.” (Bond Buyer) Funds of Private Funds for the Masses? What Investors Need to Know About the SEC’s Latest Guidance “Secondary managers have a habit of buying these funds at discounts to their net asset values and then immediately marking them back up to their NAVs once they own them. This can create illusory returns, as the apparent gains are just on paper and the result of an accounting trick. Secondary managers who do this are essentially pulling future returns into the present by assuming they can at least get the private fund’s NAV if they have to sell it today, even though they may have bought it yesterday at a discount.” (Morningstar) What Barron Capital’s Newest ETFs Say About Interest in Active Investing “Dave Nadig, Nadig.com independent ETF expert, joins CNBC’s Frank Holland on ‘Halftime Report’ to discuss Baron Capital’s entrance into the ETF market and why going active could work for the firm.” (CNBC) Stanger: Private Non-Traded REITs Outraise Publicly Traded Counterparts by 45% “Private non-traded real estate investment trusts outraised their publicly registered non-traded counterparts by over 45% to start the year, attracting over $4.2 billion of investor capital compared to $2.9 billion, respectively, as of June 30, 2025. This is according to the latest analysis by Robert A. Stanger & Company Inc., an investment banking firm and leader in alternative investment industry research. In Q2 2025, private non-traded REITs grew their aggregate net asset value to $24 billion, a 10.5% quarter-over-quarter increase, further cementing their expanding share of the non-traded REIT market.” (AltsWire) It’s Not Too Early to Look at Tax-Exempt Bond ETFs “Fall is just around the corner, and with it comes the start of portfolio preparation for the end of the year. For many investors and advisors, that means adding investments that can help reduce the tax bill from portfolios. Tax exempt bond ETFs in particular can provide a powerful tool in meeting that goal. Leaning on the ETF wrapper, those funds may be worth adding now amid continued interest rate uncertainty.” (VettaFi) Fintech Upstarts Are Powering a Boom—and Ecosystem—for Private Markets “Sophisticated platforms—typically catering to private-wealth advisers—aim to ease their clients’ ownership and management of assets in private credit, real estate, private equity and other alternative investments that, until recently, were reserved for institutional investors and the super-wealthy. New software tools, digital tokenization and AI are being put to work to remove longstanding pain points in everything from making products discoverable to executing transactions, managing ownership stakes and educating advisers and their clients.” (PitchBook) Beleaguered Private Investment B-D Draws More Regulatory Scrutiny “Linqto Capital, a private stock investment platform that last month filed for bankruptcy protection after drawing scrutiny from the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department.” (Financial Advisor IQ) The Democratization of Private Equity Could Create a “Systemic Risk Machine” “Private equity’s success depends on patient, locked-up capital insulated from the mood swings of public markets. Retail flows bring the opposite: liquidity demands, shorter investment horizons, and a political reflex for heavier oversight. Regulatory tripwires abound: Once retirement-plan investments exceed 25 percent of a fund’s assets, Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) rules apply, dragging in the kind of compliance costs and fiduciary constraints that sap agility.” (Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research) Yieldstreet’s Real Estate Struggles Could Shake Fractional Ownership Market “Yieldstreet, a once-heralded platform promising to democratize access to private real estate, recently disclosed steep losses and defaults in a large swath of its real estate deals. The ripple effects of these bad investments extended beyond its investor base. A recent review of 30 real-estate offerings revealed that four deals ended in total loss and another 23 are on watchlists and have triggered approximately $78 million in defaults in just the past year.” (Propmodo) This Classic Investment Strategy Is Still Alive in 2025 “The merit of a classic portfolio of 60% stocks and 40% bonds has been a matter of debate in recent years. A diversified 60/40 strategy failed to protect investors in 2022’s broad market crash—in fact, an all-stock portfolio would have held up better. However, a historical deep dive from Morningstar concluded that the tried-and-true approach lessened the pain in almost all of the worst market crashes in 150 years better than an all-stock portfolio. Morningstar Inc Portfolio Strategist Amy Arnott discusses the 60/40 portfolio’s ups and downs and its performance in 2025.” (Morningstar) Thoma Bravo Secures Leeway from Backers to Hand Slice of PE Deals to Other Investors “US software-focused private equity group negotiated broad carve-out in recent funds’ terms.” (Financial Times) Related:Wall Street Exit Culminates in Climate Group Halting Activities Elaine Misonzhnik Senior Editor, Investments, WealthManagement.com Elaine Misonzhnik is Senior Editor, Investments at WealthManagement.com, focusing on alternative investments.

Data shows advisors now hold $17.4 billion in Bitcoin ETF positions, nearly doubling hedge fund managers' $9 billion exposure. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Investment advisors drove institutional Bitcoin (BTC) exposure via exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to $33.6 billion during the second quarter of 2025. Data shared by Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart on Aug. 25 revealed that institutions added 57,375 BTC across all tracked categories. Bloomberg Intelligence data shows advisors now hold $17.4 billion in Bitcoin ETF positions, nearly doubling hedge fund managers’ $9 billion exposure. Brevan Howard Capital Management emerged as the largest institutional Bitcoin ETF shareholder among the new investors. The fund manager increased its BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) holdings by 71% to 37.5 million shares worth $2.3 billion as of June 30. Harvard Management Company entered the Bitcoin ETF space with a $117 million position in IBIT. Harvard’s Bitcoin allocation ranks alongside its largest US-listed holdings, including Microsoft at $310 million and Amazon near $235 million, representing approximately 8% of its reported portfolio. The university endowment now holds more Bitcoin than gold in dollars, with its SPDR Gold Trust position valued at roughly $102 million at quarter-end. Seyffart also highlighted that advisors have become “by far the biggest holders” of spot Bitcoin ETFs. They added 37,156 BTC during the second quarter and reached 161,909 BTC. He said that “pretty much every category” out of the 15 listed had increasing exposure during the second quarter, except pension funds, which maintained $10.7 million positions. Brokerage firms’ allocation via Bitcoin ETFs reached $4.3 billion, after the second-largest addition among institutions of 13,911 BTC. Banks registered the third-largest allocation of 2,476 BTC, and now have roughly $655 million in Bitcoin through ETF shares. Investment advisors’ $17.4 billion allocation exceeds the combined holdings of hedge funds, brokerages, and holding companies, signaling a shift toward professional wealth management integration. Seyffart noted that the $33.6 billion allocated by institutional investors relates to 13F form filings, representing only 25% of the total Bitcoin ETF shares. He added: “The other 75% are owned by non-filers which is largely going to be retail.” Despite the increasing institutional appetite, retail appears to drive most of the Bitcoin ETF still flows.

Wells Fargo's wealth management unit partnered with InvestCloud to add private market investments to its UMA program. August 25, 2025 Wells Fargo has become the latest wealth management firm to add alternative investment options to its UMA platform. Wells Fargo’s Wealth & Investment Management division formed a partnership with fintech firm InvestCloud to make alternative assets available through the wirehouse's personalized UMA program. The UMA program now includes a full range of alternative investment options, from private equity and private debt to hedge funds and real assets. The program uses both perpetual and drawdown fund structures. Wells joins a spate of firms that have recently added private market options to UMA platforms, including Fidelity and Goldman Sachs. “We are committed to providing new technologies that deliver personalized, scalable and data-driven client experiences,” Greg Maddox, product management executive at Wells Fargo Investment Management, said in a statement. “We are proud to offer industry-leading investment capabilities and find new and innovative ways to make the company an easier place for advisors and clients to do business.” Earlier this year, InvestCloud struck a partnership with alternative asset manager Apollo Global Management to become part of its Private Markets Account (PMA) Network, which combines public and public assets in a single platform. As a result, InvestCloud’s clients get access to Apollo’s private market model portfolios and multi-manager models in their managed account programs.

Title: Bitcoin Flash Crash Roils Crypto Market
URL: https://gizmodo.com/bitcoin-price-flash-crash-ether-thiel-2000647613
Time Published: 2025-08-25T17:50:49Z

Crypto prices dipped Monday following a so-called flash crash of Bitcoin on Sunday. And while Ethereum dipped as well, the second most popular cryptocurrency is still up significantly on the month. Bitcoin’s weekend crash is being blamed on a single whale who sold 24,000 Bitcoin, according to crypto watchers on X. Bitcoin’s most recent peak hit $117,370 on Friday, not too far from the all-time high of $124,500. But Bitcoin is currently sitting at $112,660, well below recent highs. “Bitcoin flash crash today, which wiped out $310M in long positions, has been traced to a SINGLE Bitcoin whale dumping BTC for ETH. The whale sold 24,000+ BTC, including coins that hadn’t moved in 5+ years, sending 12,000+ BTC today alone to the Hyperunite trading platform,” crypto analyst Jacob King tweeted on Sunday. “They’ve sold 18,000+ BTC ($2B) so far and are in the process of dumping the remaining 6,000+ BTC ($670M). Most of the money is being moved into Ethereum, $2B bought and $1.3B staked,” King continued. That sale seemed to set off a chain reaction and a flurry of selling with $100 billion wiped out in just 24 hours, according to Forbes, as traders seemed to worry about whether the optimism from Jerome Powell’s statements Friday might be a mirage. Powell signaled he may lower interest rates at the next meeting of the Federal Reserve in September. But others are more skeptical that the price really swung due to a whale, suggesting that it could be due to “multiple whales,” rather than a single entity, according to The Block. Whatever the reason for bitcoin’s pullback, there’s no doubt that Ethereum has been faring better in recent days. Ethereum is down almost 4% over the past 24 hours to $4,637, but is still up 24% on the month, according to CoinMarketCap. Why is Ethereum doing so well lately? There are a lot of different theories, including the popularity of spot ETFs, which now account for about $30.5 billion or 5.2% of Ethereum’s market cap, according to The Street. But there’s also just been a lot of hype in mainstream news outlets about Ethereum, with a recent story in the Wall Street Journal touting all the big money that’s “piling into” the cryptocurrency. One of those investors is apparently Peter Thiel, the billionaire co-founder of PayPal. The Journal reports that people close to Thiel believe his “recent bets stem from a belief that the Ethereum network will keep growing.” But that kind of hype should probably be taken with a grain of salt. Founders Fund, Thiel’s venture capital firm, quietly sold about $1.8 billion in crypto by the end of March 2022, not long before the crypto crash of 2022. Thiel had cashed out at a time when he was hyping crypto like crazy, telling a crypto conference in Miami around the same time that “we’re at the end of the fiat money regime.” Thiel made no mention at the conference that he was selling at what would be near the top just before a crash, according to the Financial Times, which only revealed his sales in January 2023. Thiel really has a knack for buying low and selling high, which is the smart play for any investor with discipline. But that’s obviously not how markets actually work in practice, crypto or otherwise. People buy at the top because they fear missing out, and then get left holding the bag by guys like Thiel. The question, of course, is whether crypto’s most recent highs are sustainable. The Trump regime’s embrace of crypto has been great news for the industry, but nobody knows whether the number can continue to just go up, given the uncertainty of America’s economic outlook. There’s also the small problem that crypto is little more than a speculative asset with no inherent value. Despite countless promises from crypto boosters over the past 15 years, the average person isn’t using crypto to actually buy goods on a regular basis. The Block reports that big players like BlackRock, Grayscale, and Fidelity have seen $1.4 billion in net outflows for crypto last week, the highest since March, as investors get skittish. Other cryptocurrencies were also struggling Monday, including Ripple which is down 2%, Solana down over 4%, TRON down over 3%, and Dogecoin down 5%.

Title: Bitcoin’s Volatility Drops as It Matures, Setting the Stage for Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Presale to Explode
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-matures-volatility-drops-bitcoin-hyper-presale-explodes/
Time Published: 2025-08-25T12:01:41Z
Full Content:
Believe it or not, Bitcoin’s volatility has hit a five-year low, even as its price rockets to new highs and then takes a breather. The world’s first crypto is starting to act a lot more grown-up. The crazy price swings that it was famous for are now a thing of the past. For years, Bitcoin’s wild price fluctuations scared potential investors. But it now seems less jumpy than a big tech stock. According to recent data, Bitcoin’s volatility has been lower than even Wall Street giants like Nvidia since 2022. This shift shows a big change in how the market sees Bitcoin. Popular crypto analyst Lyn Alden even thinks this current bull run will be ‘less extreme’ and last longer. We might see more steady climbs and periods of instability instead of the usual ‘to the moon and then crash’ pattern, she explains in a recent interview for CryptoSlate. Bitcoin is finally settling down and acting like a legitimate financial asset. So, why is Bitcoin suddenly so chill? A big reason is the launch of the spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. back in early 2024. These new, regulated products, offered by major players like BlackRock and Fidelity, made it super easy for everyday people and big institutions to get into Bitcoin. With more people and more money flowing in, the market became a lot more stable, smoothing out those wild price swings. Another factor is that you can now put Bitcoin in your 401(k) retirement account. As big-money players like pension funds and insurance companies start adding Bitcoin to their portfolios, the asset becomes less vulnerable to short-term speculators. This means less drama and more stability. Bitcoin is also starting to move in sync with the broader stock market, which is another huge sign that it’s officially part of the mainstream. For both casual investors and institutions, this lower volatility means less risk and a smoother ride. It proves Bitcoin is officially leaving its rebellious teenage phase behind and settling into its role as a key player in the financial world. Its promising blockchain upscaling soltuion and an explosive presale nearing $12M are the main reasons why we think it’s one of the best crypto presales in 2025. The team behind Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) saw the many challenges faced by $BTC and decided to build a powerful new layer to upgrade the OG. Bitcoin is a legend, but it’s got some major hang-ups. While it was a revolutionary idea, it was never built for the lightning-fast, high-tech world we live in now. Its transactions are painfully slow, it’s not programmable for modern protocols like you see on Ethereum and Solana, and the fees can get pretty high when the network’s busy. Enter Bitcoin Hyper’s Layer-2: fully programable for DeFi thanks to integrating the Solana Virtual Machine; maintaining trustless cross-chain transfers and secure settlement on Bitcoin’s network. Their goal? To transform Bitcoin from a simple digital asset into a full-blown platform for innovation, all while keeping that rock-solid security that Bitcoin is famous for. Right now, the token sells for $0.012795. However, our $HYPER price prediction sees a potential $0.32 high by the end of 2025. Check $HYPER to lock 2,400% potential ROI. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) aims to solve Bitcoin’s bottlenecks, but it’s not the first L2 project to attempt this. So, what makes it unique? It’s the Solana Virtual Machine integration. This add-on basically brings the insane speed and low latency of Solana to the Bitcoin world. It’s a simple but powerful change that brings Bitcoin up to modern standards. This means developers can finally create super-fast, scalable dApps on a network that’s still backed by Bitcoin’s security. That’s how Bitcoin Hyper acts as a high-performance Layer 2 chain, handling transactions at warp speed and then settling them on the main Bitcoin network later. This setup keeps costs low and speed high without clogging up the original chain. Another staple is the Canonical Bridge. It’s a decentralized bridge that lets you move your Bitcoin from the main chain to the Layer 2 easily and securely. Once your $BTC is on the new layer, you can use it for virtually everything, from quick payments to DeFi protocols and NFT platforms. Thanks to this new system, Bitcoin is becoming a dynamic platform ready for the future. Our full guide to What is Bitcoin Hyper covers its roadmap and features in even more detail. Visit the Bitcoin Hyper presale for 93% APY. Bitcoin’s story is about growing up. It’s moving on from being that wild, rebellious teenager to a more stable and serious adult in the financial world. A major part of it is thanks to big-time players getting involved with things like ETFs and retirement accounts. With Hyper’s help, Bitcoin isn’t just ‘digital gold’ you stick in a vault anymore. It’s becoming a versatile platform ready to power a whole new wave of apps. Remember to do your own research and invest wisely. This article isn’t financial advice.

Title: Five Ways To Avoid The Five Hottest Stocks
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/baldwin/2025/08/25/five-ways-to-avoid-nvidia-microsoft-apple-amazon-and-meta/
Time Published: 2025-08-25T10:30:00Z
Full Content:
ByWilliam Baldwin, Senior Contributor. Indexitis: The nagging fear that too much of your net worth is invested in the S&P 500, and too much of that is invested in five exuberantly priced stocks. The affliction is becoming more common. The popular index has 28% of its value in Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and Meta Platforms (i.e., Facebook). This is twice the top-five concentration level the index has had historically. Herewith are five cures for indexitis, ranging from a modest tweak to your choice of stock index fund to a dramatic move into one very interesting bond. Index investing is not necessarily a bad idea, and the market is not necessarily acting irrationally in putting high price tags on fast-growing tech firms. It is a tribute to the success of passive investing, to the investment company founded by the late John Bogle and to the popularity of artificial intelligence chips that we have a fund with a $107 billion holding in one stock. That’s the Vanguard S&P 500 fund’s position in Nvidia. But history tells us that mighty fortresses crumble. Forty years ago, the top three U.S. companies in market value were IBM, Exxon and General Electric. Their locations in today’s 500 are at positions 34, 14 and 26. Here are five ways to take a step back from the S&P 500. Important assumption: You’re rebalancing inside a tax-deferred account. In a taxable account with unrealized gains, the smart thing to do is nothing. Replace your S&P 500 index fund with a fund that owns the whole U.S. stock market. Customers of Fidelity Investments have access to the best deal, its Zero Total Stock Market fund, with a 0% expense ratio. Ticker: FZROX. Without a Fidelity account you’re better off in an exchange-traded fund; these can be held at any brokerage. Vanguard, Schwab and BlackRock (iShares) all have total market ETFs priced at 0.03% per year, meaning you pay $3 a year per $10,000 invested. Tickers, respectively: VTI, SCHB and ITOT. The total market funds have roughly 80% of their assets in the S&P 500. All you are accomplishing with this switch is adding a small allocation to smaller companies. The Fidelity fund has 2,100 of these small stocks, the Vanguard fund 3,000. You can find these alternative index funds in the domestic stock chapter of the Forbes Fund Finder. In lieu of a U.S.-only stock portfolio, you could have one that blends U.S. and foreign stocks. Obvious choice: the Vanguard Total World Stock ETF (VT, expense 0.06%). This fund has two-thirds of its money in North America, the rest abroad. VT’s portfolio of 9,980 stocks starts out looking like the S&P 500, with Nvidia at the top, but as you scroll down you’ll see names like Taiwan Semiconductor and Tencent Holdings. Instead of accepting Vanguard’s 34% allocation to stocks on other continents, you could set your own percentage by moving some money to a purely foreign portfolio. There are several good ETFs to pick from. Cheapest: SPDR Portfolio Developed World ex-U.S. (SPDW, 0.03%). It has 2,350 stocks, starting with ASML, which makes the machines that Taiwan Semiconductor uses to make chips for Nvidia. There are several low-cost ETFs that hold only small-capitalization stocks, or only small- and mid-cap. Cheapest: SPDR Portfolio S&P 600 Small Cap (SPSM, 0.03%). Its largest position is in Mr. Cooper Group, a fast-moving mortgage lender. Over the past five years, as the S&P 500 has almost doubled, one thing has gotten cheaper: a long-term inflation-protected bond. With a bond, “cheap” is synonymous with “high-yielding.” In August 2020, a 20-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Security (TIPS) was yielding -0.6%, which is to say, the government was charging you money for letting you lend to it. Now the yield is 2.5%, a huge 3.1-point swing in your favor. That’s a real yield, not to be compared with the nominal yield you see on a bank account or corporate bond. There are very good TIPS ETFs on the market but they tend to have short-term bonds. For a concentrated bet (and for a better real yield), go long. If you have at least $100,000 to invest, buy a TIPS in the secondary market. One that I like (because the bid/ask spread was narrow) is the 0.875% due in February 2047. At Fidelity it was recently quoted at 71.968 bid, 72.093 ask. These market prices must be multiplied by an inflation factor, and the bottom line on a ticket for 100 bonds (that is, $100,000 of par value when issued) would have been $96,470. These numbers are bit confusing, so here’s what counts. The real yield to maturity came to 2.57% for a buyer. The yield spread was 1 basis point (one-hundredth of a percentage point). If we presume that the true value is midway between bid and ask, you are in effect coughing up half a basis point of annual return to the middleman. That’s a better deal than the 3 basis points you pay to own an ETF, at least if you hold the bond to maturity. Long Treasury bonds are risky, because real rates could go still higher (making the bond’s value go down), and because the Treasury might default. But bonds are a lot less risky than today’s tippy toppy S&P 500.

Title: Irish beaches at cleanest in eight years, litter survey finds
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/environment/2025/08/25/irish-beaches-at-cleanest-in-eight-years-litter-survey-finds/
Time Published: 2025-08-25T07:25:33Z
Full Content:
Irish beaches are at their cleanest in eight years, according to Irish Business Against Litter (IBAL). The group’s latest survey of Ireland’s coasts and inland waterways, conducted by An Taisce for the business group, awarded 17 of 33 the beaches, harbours and rivers monitored clean status. The result marks a 50 per cent improvement on the last survey despite the warm weather this summer bringing large numbers to the coast. The number of areas classified as littered dropped from 11 to three, with cigarette butts, sweet papers and fast food wrappers the most commonly found discarded items. Sites falling into this category are Dingle Harbour in Co Kerry; Dog’s Bay beach in Co Galway; and White Bay Beach in Co Cork. Among the popular sites to be awarded clean status were Brittas Bay in Co Wicklow; Curracloe in Co Wexford; Bundoran in Co Donegal; Killiney in Co Dublin; Strandhill in Co Sligo; and Tramore in Co Waterford. None of the sites surveyed were placed in the lowest category: heavily littered. Portmarnock in Co Dublin registered a dramatic improvement on its previous ‘littered’ rating, while similar improvement was noted at Blackrock Castle and Castletownbere in Co Cork. However, Dingle experienced a demotion to littered, as did Dog’s Bay beach and White Bay. “This is by far the most favourable result we have seen in eight years of coastal surveys,” said Conor Horgan of IBAL. “The Trojan and ever-expanding work of clean coasts groups and other volunteers is instrumental in this, as is the investment by councils in facilities around our beaches.” Legislative measures such as the tethering of caps to plastic bottles and the deposit return scheme have contributed to the improvement, IBAL said. The first coastal survey conducted since the introduction of the deposit return scheme shows a 30 per cent drop in the volume of these items being discarded. Under the scheme customers pay a refundable deposit on plastic bottles and cans and claim a credit when they return the bottle or can to a reverse-vending machine. Vapes were less prevalent than in previous studies, but coffee cup litter remained high, with cups found in 42 per cent of surveyed sites. “The coffee cup levy seems to have died with the last government, but these findings show that the case for it has not died,” said Mr Horgan, adding that coastal areas would benefit from a coffee cup-free policy similar to Killarney’s model. In 2022, the Co Kerry town became the first town in Ireland to phase out single-use coffee cups. An Taisce’s annual call to action – the Big Beach Clean Up – is expected to attract more than 600 groups and 15,000 volunteers nationwide to Irish beaches from September 19th to 21st.

Title: How spending two minutes picking up plastic on the beach can make a big difference

Headed to the beach this month? Chances are you’ll make a visit. A bracing swim, some fish and chips and a 99 are just the traditions to round out an Irish summer. But there’s something else you could make part of your beach routine and that’s a two-minute beach clean. This practice can go a long way towards making our beaches better. You’ll see all kinds of litter on a day at the beach. From food packaging and broken toys to discarded vapes and fishing and boating paraphernalia, marine litter comes from all sorts of land- and sea-based activities. What we see on the beach is only part of the problem, according to Beaches.ie, an initiative of the Environmental Protection Agency. It is estimated that 15 per cent of marine litter ends up on the sand, 15 per cent floats in the water and 70 per cent rests on the seabed. This stuff doesn’t just spoil the beauty of our beaches, it can harm marine life and their habitats too. Plastic litter kills an estimated 100,000 marine mammals and turtles worldwide every year. This includes 30,000 seals and up to a million seabirds, who either get entangled in it or eat it, according to Beaches.ie. In some areas, plastic accounts for 80 per cent of the litter and can remain in the marine environment for hundreds of years. That’s a day at the beach that isn’t getting forgotten any time soon. Marine experts fear there could be more plastic than fish in the ocean by 2050, measured by weight, according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a UK-based charity working to end waste in the economy. Initiatives such as the #2MinuteBeachClean, operated as part of An Taisce’s Clean Coasts programme and supported by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and Heritage is one way we can help stop the tide of litter. Spending just two minutes picking up the things we see at the beach can make a big difference. Not only will it make the beach a nicer place to be, but every piece of litter removed is a piece of litter that won’t pollute our oceans or be ingested by marine life. Taking just two minutes, each #2MinuteBeachClean is estimated to collect about 1-2kg of litter. If everybody in Ireland did a #2MinuteBeachClean per month, that would be more than 100,000 tonnes of litter removed from our ocean this year. Blue Flag beaches have #2minutebeachclean stations with bags and litter pickers you can borrow to make it easier to help keep our beaches litter free. You could do as some others are doing and take a photo of the litter and post it on social media (X or Instagram using the #2minutebeachclean) before putting the litter in the bin. [ Plastic colonialism: ‘A stream of plastic debris, stretching miles, is heading towards us’Opens in new window ] Search the #2minutebeachclean hashtag and you’ll find groups such as the Tomhaggard Clean Coasts group in Wexford, which removed 25 bags of waste at Carnsore in July. Their finds included a tyre and a lobster pot. Some 10 volunteers from the Blackrock Clean Up in Cork group gathered 11 bags of litter on one of the hottest days of the year. Clean Coasts Ballynamona, also in Cork, brought pupils from four primary schools to Garrylucas Beach in June. They gathered litter and learned about the importance of keeping their local beaches clean. Finds from two-minute beach cleaners include everything from a Die Hard DVD in Donabate to a Child of Prague statue, buried in the sand. So next time you visit the beach, whether you are going for a swim or walking the dog, think about joining the growing movement of people who are reducing marine litter, two minutes at a time. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Business FILE PHOTO: Mizuho Bank's signboard is pictured in Tokyo, Japan, January 25, 2017. Picture taken January 25, 2017. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/File photo LONDON/TOKYO :Japanese banks Mizuho and MUFG are targeting buying or partnering with overseas money managers, they told Reuters, joining other Japanese financial companies aiming for a larger share of the global investing market. Mizuho is prioritising a tie-up with a private asset specialist in Europe or the United States to give it a foothold in areas such as the booming credit market or infrastructure financing, an executive told Reuters. MUFG, meanwhile, has identified overseas asset management - particularly in the United States and Europe - as a priority area for potential deals, the company said. The banks, two of the largest in Japan, collectively manage about $1.3 trillion through their asset management arms, largely for local clients. They declined to comment on whether discussions with target companies had already taken place and there is no certainty transactions will happen.

Title: Bitcoin volatility keeps falling, and that means it’s maturing as an asset class

Bitcoin volatility has dropped to a five-year low as the number-one crypto matures, showing more price predictability than blue-chip tech stocks. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate.

The world’s number-one crypto is looking more like a mature asset class every day as Bitcoin volatility continues to drop (yes, even as it blasts past all-time highs and promptly retraces its steps). Bitcoin has long been regarded as one of the most volatile financial assets; its turbulent price fluctuations over the years have deterred many investors. But what if I told you that Bitcoin is now less volatile than a blue-chip tech stock? According to ecoinometrics, Bitcoin’s 30-day realized volatility is now at its lowest point in nearly five years, and it’s a trend that has persisted even through Bitcoin’s headline-making rallies and corrections over the last five years: “Exactly what you expect from a maturing asset.” Since 2022, Bitcoin has often been less volatile than some of Wall Street’s biggest names, including mega-cap stocks like Nvidia. During the sharp tech sector swings of 2023 and 2024, Nvidia’s price was more unpredictable than Bitcoin, an asset infamous for its hair-raising moves. Even during this current Bitcoin bull run, the price swings have remained notably tamer than previous cycles. Macro analyst Lyn Alden recently told CryptoSlate she believes that Bitcoin’s cycles are changing. We should expect this one to be longer and “less extreme” than previous runs, with strong moves upward followed by periods of consolidation, “rather than going to the moon and collapsing.” Bitcoin volatility declining is just one marker of its growing maturity. The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. in early 2024 was a landmark event, opening up the asset to the mainstream audience. Major asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity offer direct Bitcoin exposure to retail and institutional investors through regulated exchange-traded products. This has introduced broader ownership and liquidity, dampening large price swings and integrating Bitcoin more deeply into traditional markets. Moreover, recent regulatory changes now allow Americans to include Bitcoin in their 401k retirement accounts. As diversified portfolios absorb BTC allocations, Bitcoin volatility further subsides. Pension funds, endowments, and insurance companies have begun allocating to Bitcoin as part of their alternative asset strategies. This increases trading by sophisticated investors and reduces the impact of short-term speculative flows. Increasingly, Bitcoin’s price shows a higher correlation with broader equity markets during risk-on and risk-off periods, another sign of integration and maturity. While you can argue whether this is what we intended for Bitcoin, it does reflect mainstream market adoption. And hey, strong-willed kids become adults who change the world, as Bitcoin is undoubtedly doing. For everyday investors and institutions alike, lower Bitcoin volatility translates to less risk and a smoother investment profile. It’s also a sign that Bitcoin is outgrowing its adolescent phase of wild speculative swings and turbulence, and settling into its role as a legitimate member of society and staple of diversified portfolios.
