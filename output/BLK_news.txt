Share this article Spot Ethereum ETFs recorded $76 million in outflows on Monday, with major asset managers BlackRock and Fidelity among the firms reporting investor redemptions from their exchange-traded funds. The outflows continue a pattern of volatility seen in September 2025, with ETH-tracking funds experiencing fluctuating investor interest. Fidelity and Bitwise drove much of the redemption activity, while BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum ETF saw occasional inflows that partially offset the broader trend across the product category. Since launching in July 2024, spot Ethereum ETFs have accumulated over $13 billion in net inflows overall. However, Grayscale’s legacy trust has seen outflows exceeding $4.5 billion as investors migrated to newer, lower-fee alternatives. The funds have shown institutional appetite for ETH exposure in recent months, with several trading days recording more than $100 million in inflows. Ethereum traded at approximately current levels amid broader digital asset market movements. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Anthony Scaramucci, strategic advisor of AgriFORCE Growing Systems Ltd. AGRI, sounded optimistic on Avalanche AVAX/USD on Monday, deeming it as the “Swiss army knife” among Layer-1 networks. AGRI stock is racing ahead of the pack. See if it is worth your attention here. Skybridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci, who will serve as the company’s strategic advisor, said that they made a “big bet” on Avalanche due to its tokenization potential. “Lots of big corporate CTOs are picking up Avalanche as part of their story to tokenize their funds or potentially even tokenize their assets,” he said. Scaramucci also highlighted the importance of subnets, interoperable networks within Avalanche’s ecosystem that can be tailored to specific use cases. “I often say that Avalanche is like a Swiss army knife of Layer-1 networks, so it’s got a lot of flexibility,” he added. See Also: Crypto Isn’t The Real Threat – It’s Regulatory Chaos The rebranding and capital raise strategy comes in the wake of growing interest in the Avalanche network. Scaramucci endorsed the Layer-1 network last month, stating that its "moment is coming.” He said last year that AVAX, often dubbed an Ethereum ETH/USD-killer, is part of his cryptocurrency portfolio and among the "high-quality, great core assets” in the long term. Avalanche, which launched in 2020, seeks to provide scalable and secure infrastructure for decentralized applications and smart contracts. Notably, BlackRock’s tokenized fund, the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, expanded its use to the Avalanche blockchain. Price Action: At the time of writing, AVAX was trading up 4.78% to $33.29, according to data from Benzinga Pro. The coin has surged 27% over the last month. AgriFORCE shares slipped 7.08% in after-hours trading after closing 134.44% higher at $5.650 during Monday’s regular trading session. The stock lagged on the Momentum and Growth parameters as of this writing. Visit Benzinga Edge Stock Rankings to compare it with leading cryptocurrency treasury firms, such as Strategy Inc.

Title: Market Analyst Alleges XRP Price Is Being Deliberately Suppressed, Who Are The Culprits?
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-price-deliberately-suppressed/
Time Published: 2025-09-23T02:00:47Z
Full Content:
A new debate is emerging in the crypto world after a video shared by Versan Aljarrah, the founder of Black Swan Capitalist, highlighted bold claims from about the XRP price financial expert Dr. Jim Willie. In the video, Willie claims that the current XRP price is not natural and powerful players are artificially holding it down. According to Willie, the goal of this move is to acquire more XRP at low prices due to its expected role in the future of global finance. Dr. Jim Willie explains that large banks and financial institutions are not letting the XRP price rise in value at this stage. He says this is not by accident but by design. In his words, what appears to be a flat market is, in reality, a stall created by influential players. According to Willie, these institutions believe XRP will be a key part of the financial system in the future. That is why they are working to build their holdings while the asset remains cheap. Instead of letting the market decide its fair price, they are making sure the cost stays low long enough for them to collect more. Willie goes further by naming some of the groups he believes are involved. He points to BlackRock as one of the major players working to keep XRP under pressure. He even calls BlackRock “a disgustingly corrupt private equity firm” instead of a bank, making clear how negative his view of them is. Willie also says big players may ask Ripple to go along with this plan. He claims the big players are asking Ripple to help keep XRP under $3 so they can buy massive amounts. According to him, they do not want to buy XRP at $7 or $8, which is where he believes the market already values the asset. Instead, they want Ripple’s help to hold it down, giving them time to buy what he calls “a boatload” of tokens at bargain prices. These statements, shared by Aljarrah, suggest that the current market price of XRP may not be a natural one. If Willie’s claims are valid, then what people see is not simply a matter of supply and demand but a coordinated effort by strong financial groups to control the XRP price and reap the most significant benefits. Many traders and investors have long worried that digital assets do not move freely, but rather, powerful hands behind the scenes actively shape them. Within the digital asset ecosystem, where trust and transparency are already constant issues, such claims strike at the heart of ongoing debates about whether ordinary investors are getting a fair market or one designed to benefit only the most prominent institutions.

Skip to comments. Posted on 09/22/2025 12:50:06 PM PDT by whyilovetexas111 Baltic incidents—drones, airspace brushes, GNSS spoofing—could cascade into a NATO–Russia war driven by fear, honor, and interest. Opening phases likely favor NATO in air and sea with superior ISR, EW, and standoff fires; Russia counters with missiles, dense air defenses, cyber, and navigation attacks. Two plausible endgames emerge: a non-nuclear grind to an armistice shaped by attrition and political risk, or limited nuclear use to coerce termination, shattering the taboo and accelerating crisis instability.

Nobody wins, everybody loses, especially the U.S. taxpayer! Blackrock and the Finks of the world win. They get to rape taxpayers for weapons contracts, then get the re-construction contracts, and then get dibs on resources. Ivan, you’re in our airspace! Turn 180 and fly east to exit! No one can predict military outcomes, maybe that’s why I found the article to be ridiculous. It says NATO would just want to preserve alliance territory. And Russia would just want an aftermath where it has more influence over Europe. Hogwash. Russia would seek to hold as much of Eastern and Western Europe as possible. NATO would need to stop the Russian invasion by defeating the Russian army. Would it lead to nuclear exchanges? Depends. If Russia wants to go scorched earth they will use nukes at the outset or as soon as they suffer setbacks. Most likely both sides would try to keep it conventional, in which case Russia would seize some easy territory and then be defeated by the US and NATO. They are no match for our air force for starters. They can’t move on the ground like us, and right now they are tied down in Ukraine. Their navy? Please. If this is part of a coordinated attack with China, all bets are off and it’s balls to the walls on all fronts. That’s why we need to deter this stuff through strength. Russia has all they can handle fighting Ukraine. If the war spreads, Russia will fragment. On 24 November 2015, a Turkish Air Force F-16 fighter jet shot down a Russian Sukhoi Su-24M attack aircraft near the Syria–Turkey border. According to Turkey, the aircraft was fired upon while in Turkish airspace because it violated the border up to a depth of 2.19 kilometres (1.36 miles) for about 17 seconds after being warned to change its heading ten times over a period of five minutes before entering the airspace Get the US out of NATO. This isn’t our battle. It’s Europe’s. I’m sick and tired of wasting my taxpayer dollars on proxy wars with Russia. “...that’s why I found the article to be ridiculous. The editor in chief of the NSJ has been published in the NY Times and CNN. Not to be trusted with anything. wy69 China. The rump UK empire/EU-Davos are collapsing Their last desperate act will be to start war, especially involving the United States. We'll See. I think Putun is stress-testing the alliance. He suspects Germans will not die to defend Estonians. He suspects Trump will be disappointed but unwilling to defend them. And re-absorbing the Baltics rights what he considers a historic wrong since he considers the Baltics to be historically Russian. And, he can say he is defending the rights of Russian speakers there. Weakness invites him to roll the dice. The MIC Why should the US sacrifice everything for the MUSLIM CALIPHATE of Western Europe? Let’s be honest: Western Europe has fallen to Islam and the WEF (WEF supports sharia). Poland, Hungary and Slovakia are standing strong against the Sharia-friendly EUSSR, but the US cannot afford to pay for another stupid war, nor do Americans want our troops dying in vain. Of course, if it goes nuclear, none of this matters. And, I really don’t want to witness a nuclear holocaust for Ukraine. We keep hearing this Boomer braggadocio about mighty NATO. Meanwhile, the West is still failing on the basics like artillery ammunition production. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZcZrPWlZbQ it won’t happen I think this is what we are seeing. a series of events, possible false flags, hyped into a justification for more overt involvement against russia, then a cry of article 5 when things happen. some of the pictures from poland of the drones make little credible sense. drones clearly photo-staged in places they didn’t land, duct tape on them, etc. Europe in general does not want this to stop, and they will force trumps hand on it. they are doing so now. If Russia can’t defeat Ukraine and has most of its army bogged down there, how the hell would it then take on all the members of NATO including the United States? Has nothing to do with braggadocia. With the commitment of all the Western air forces including the US? With the US Navy battle groups committed? With the US and Europe on a war footing? Russia can’t defeat Ukraine, it made a mess of that campaign, with what additional army would it take on all the countries of NATO? why do you think Russia constantly threatened nuclear war (sort of) if NATO became involved? Why do you think Russia has tolerated direct attacks on its forces and facilities inside Russia? In addition to being an idiot, Putin knows Russia cannot take On NATO. He might try to grab the Baltics if he thinks NATO will back down rather than fight him. Whatever. Show me any recent analysis that has Russia defeating NATO in a conventional war. That’s what the article was addressing, wasn’t it? Trump is not weakness. And we are preparing for Putin to invade the Baltics.

Title: Adani Group Plans Leverage Cut, Sees No Dollar Bond Until 2027
URL: https://www.ndtvprofit.com/markets/adani-group-plans-leverage-cut-sees-no-dollar-bond-until-2027
Time Published: 2025-09-22T16:32:05Z
Full Content:
Indian conglomerate Adani Group aims to cut its leverage over the next five years and has no plans to issue bonds in international capital markets until 2027. The group’s next foreign currency bond sale will likely be a dollar bond, said group Chief Financial Officer Jugeshinder Singh. Issuances in the domestic market as well as Reg D issuances, where borrowers can sell securities without having to register them with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, will continue. The billionaire Gautam Adani-led group, which is among the largest Indian issuers of dollar bonds, will work to pare its leverage until 2030, Singh said, speaking in an interview in London. The measures would reinforce an effort by Adani to introduce more financial discipline to its balance sheet after bond spreads widened in the wake of a short-seller report in 2023 and an investigation into an alleged bribery scheme by the US Department of Justice the following year, which the group has denied. India’s securities market regulator on Thursday cleared the group’s founder of some allegations raised by the short-seller. Singh said Adani “aims to reduce the leverage level of portfolio companies to a level similar to established utilities in OECD member countries than emerging markets levels.” Adani is cutting leverage because it has become “counterproductive” to hold too much cash on its balance sheet, especially after positive rating actions. Even though the group’s net debt has risen in recent years, a faster level of earnings growth has driven down leverage from a peak in the 2022 fiscal year. Net debt was about 2.37 trillion rupees ($26.9 billion) for the 2025 fiscal year, while the net debt to EBITDA ratio, a measure of leverage, was 2.63 times, according to a credit update note published by the conglomerate in August. That’s down from 3.81 times three years prior. Earlier this year, the ports unit began buying back some of its outstanding debt. Still, Adani will have to balance its effort to cut leverage with ambitious capital spending plans and a recent spate of private debt deals from lenders including Apollo Global Management Inc., Metlife Inc., and BlackRock Inc. At the annual meeting of the flagship company earlier this year, founder Gautam Adani touted plans to spend between $15 and $20 billion annually over the next five years. In November, Adani said in a post on X that the group would invest $10 billion in US energy security and infrastructure projects. Singh said the group doesn’t need to borrow the finance the $10 billion investment plans in the U.S. as the expenditure is within the group’s ‘cash envelope,’ referring to cash generated by companies, and it represents a small portion of the group’s broader spending plans over the next five to six years.

Title: Hightower Hires Former BlackRock Executive to Help Scale Operations
URL: https://www.wealthmanagement.com/ria-news/hightower-hires-former-blackrock-exec-to-help-scale-operations
Time Published: 2025-09-22T16:08:31Z

The move comes as new Hightower CEO Larry Restieri starts putting his stamp on the firm after years of rampant acquisition. September 22, 2025 Hightower Advisors, the Chicago-based mega-RIA with $326 billion in client assets, has hired a former BlackRock executive as head of operations and services amid a push to boost connectivity between advisors and the home office. Patrick Dunne has joined Hightower as a managing director and head of operations and service. According to his LinkedIn, Dunne’s most recent role has been as founder and lead of BlueGranite, an investor working to “scale” fintech and investment firms. Earlier in his career, he held various leadership roles at BlackRock, including head of iShares global markets and investments. “We are pleased to welcome Patrick Dunne to Hightower,” a spokesperson said via email. “His experience scaling complex organizations will help accelerate our ongoing investment in operational excellence—making it easier for advisors to serve clients.” According to filings, Dunne will join with an equity stake in Hightower, which is majority owned by private equity firm Thomas H. Lee Partners. In separate news, Charis Jones, Hightower's executive director of compliance, has left the firm for a new position that, according to a LinkedIn post, she will announce soon. Hightower did not respond to a request for comment on whether they are replacing the role. Related:TradePMR Offers 0.5% Asset Match on New Deposits for RIA Clients Changes at the mega-RIA come as new CEO Larry Restieri begins to make his mark on the firm. The former CEO of Goldman Sachs’ Ayco business was named the new head in February to take over from Bob Oros, who remains on the firm’s board. His official start was in June. Restieri hired State Street alum Randy Bullard in one of his early moves to lead a new centralized investment management platform. The platform is designed to provide Hightower’s roughly 660 advisors with institutional research and investment counsel from the recent Hightower acquisition of NEPC, an institutional consulting firm and outsourced chief investment officer. “We expect our advisors will choose to adopt the centralized investments platform because of its compelling features, products, and the improved client experience that it will offer our practices; importantly, though, it will be the advisors’ choice to adopt the central platform, not a requirement,” a spokesperson said. “It’s just one of the ways Larry envisions delivering enhancements for advisors.” The RIA has more “advancements for advisors” in the coming months, the spokesperson said. In the meantime, Restieri is working to create more collaboration between advisors and the home office. He has been speaking with Hightower advisors about creating “regional support to help advisory practices collaborate and work more closely together with each other and with home office specialists,” according to a spokesperson. “This regional approach does not represent a consolidation strategy but is a way to better engage and support our practices.” Related:Pennsylvania-Based Institutional and Wealth Firms Combine to Form $9B Shop Citywire had previously reported that Hightower was pursuing a regional consolidation strategy, citing sources. Restieri takes over after Oros led years of acquisitions for Hightower. Oros joined in 2019, replacing founder Elliot Weissbluth, who built Hightower primarily from wirehouse breakaway advisors. Under Oros, the firm shifted to acquiring RIAs with private equity funding. During his tenure, the firm made over 50 acquisitions.

Title: Exclusive: The CEO Who Wants to Make Her Bank the U.S. Gateway to Central Asia

Washington, D.C. –When Umut Abakirova graduated from the American University of Central Asia, she began her career as a loan officer. Two decades later, she is one of Central Asia’s most prominent women in finance: chief executive of Bakai Bank, one of the Kyrgyz Republic’s largest private lenders. Her ambition is to turn Bakai into a gateway between Central Asia and the West, a partner for American companies and investors seeking exposure to an overlooked but resource-rich region. In an interview with Breitbart News, Abakirova made her case for why Washington should pay attention. “We came here to represent our country, a little but very strong country, I would say, Kyrgyzstan,” she said. “We are growing very fast. And we are ready to be transparent and open for international cooperation.” Bakai has expanded rapidly. It serves more than a million clients, doubled its loan portfolio in the past two years, and counts Coca-Cola, KFC, Hyatt Regency, and General Electric among its corporate customers. In 2025 it became an official partner of UFC CIS, boosting its brand visibility far beyond finance. A Fitch Ratings report in June assigned Bakai a “B-” rating with a stable outlook, praising its profitability, deposit growth, and adequate capital buffers. The bank’s loan book grew at a 38 percent annual pace from 2022 through 2024, while deposits surged 64 percent. Abakirova described a problem little discussed outside the region: remittances from Kyrgyz workers in Russia, who make up roughly one-third of the country’s labor force. Western sanctions on Moscow have made official transfers nearly impossible. “Now this money is coming to our country by cash, or by crypto, or by Chinese yuan,” she said. “Honestly, we don’t like this growing influence of China.” She warned that sanctions are unintentionally strengthening Beijing’s hand in Central Asia. “We are afraid of secondary sanctions,” Abakirova said. “But we need some assurance from the government of USA or OFAC to make these transfers officially.” OFAC is the common abbreviation for the Office of Foreign Assets Control. It’s an office of the U.S. Department of the Treasury that administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions against targeted foreign countries, regimes, groups, and individuals. The request, never before aired publicly, points to the delicate position of a small state wedged between Russia and China but seeking Western ties. The dependency runs deeper than remittances. “We have no choice besides buying gas from Russia,” she said, explaining how sanctions policies are inadvertently pushing her country toward alternatives Washington would prefer to avoid. “That’s why we have come here.” Despite its international outreach—audited by KPMG, deploying U.S.-made LexisNexis compliance systems, and publishing its first ESG report—Bakai still faces a basic barrier: no American bank has correspondent accounts in the Kyrgyz Republic, or even in Central Asia. “That is also a problem for our region,” Abakirova said. “We are very transparent. But we need those relationships to connect.” Her push is to persuade U.S. banks and regulators that Bakai is a credible counterparty—highlighting the bank’s Big Four audits, membership in Washington-based trade finance associations, and its designation as a systemically important bank at home. Kyrgyzstan’s Abakirova sits down for a face-to-face Interview with John Carney (Breitbart News) Kyrgyz itself has been expanding at a brisk clip, with 9 percent GDP growth annually from 2022 through 2024, the highest in Central Asia. The government is building more renewable energy capacity, expanding railways, and tapping deposits of gold, lithium, and rare earths critical to global supply chains. “We are more open. We are more democratic, in comparison with other countries, and we are more open for international institutions,” Abakirova said. Her pitch is that the country offers both strategic resources and political openness, making it a natural partner for the U.S. “We want to be a gateway to Central Asia for America,” Abakirova said, saying this could make the region less dependent on Russia and China. Abakirova’s personal trajectory mirrors her country’s ambitions. She rose from entry-level loan officer to CEO of Bakai after the bank acquired her employer. Now she oversees an institution with an 11 percent share of sector assets and a 12 percent share of deposits, growing fast but still looking for outside partners. Her meetings in Washington this summer with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and executives from BlackRock and Bank of America were a first step. Whether her calls for U.S. engagement are answered may determine if Bakai remains a domestic success—or becomes Central Asia’s bridge to the global financial system.

Title: The Great TikTok Sell-Off: Implications For US Consumers
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/anjanasusarla/2025/09/22/the-great-tiktok-sell-off-implications-for-us-consumers/
Time Published: 2025-09-22T12:21:41Z
Full Content:
ByAnjana Susarla, Contributor. Talks are ongoing between President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping on a potential TikTok deal. The Wall Street Journal is reporting that TikTok engineers will re-create a set of content-recommendation algorithms for the app in the US, using technology licensed from TikTok’s parent ByteDance. Such an arrangement could assuage concerns about national security. On April 24, 2024, the U.S. enacted the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which requires TikTok to be sold by its parent company, ByteDance, to non-Chinese owners or face a nationwide ban. The Supreme Court upheld the law in January 2025. Users on digital platforms face an overabundance of viewing choices. Unlike in the past where a consumer had to drive to a physical store and spend time browsing the limited inventory, now we have seemingly endless choices. Recommendation algorithms on various platforms, be it Netflix, TikTok, or YouTube — control how we navigate the choices made available by on-demand streaming media, since there is too much content for any one user to filter through. The digital overabundance of choices increases our dependence on algorithmic filters to curate and sort our entertainment preferences. This is where TikTok has an edge over its competitors. TikTok’s recommendation algorithm is hyper-personalized. The platform tracks incredibly detailed engagement patterns, such as video interactions (like, share, how long you watch a video), scrolling behavior (speed and pattern of navigation), your search history, the time spent on the app and your content creation patterns. TikTok also gathers very detailed location information, ranging from browsing habits and GPS location to interactions within apps, including precise GPS coordinates (if enabled), location inferred from IP address and time zone information. All this information is analyzed to personalize a "For You" page, predict what content consumers engage with, target advertisements and to identify trending content and creators. The sheer volume and granularity of this data collection allows TikTok to build incredibly detailed user profiles, enabling their highly addictive recommendation algorithm while raising significant privacy concerns about how this information is stored, processed, and potentially shared. A new ownership structure could allow American supervision of the algorithm. Traditional e-commerce platforms are goal oriented and assume customers know what they want and come to shop with a specific purpose. E-commerce platforms such as Amazon implicitly assume that users have a clear purchase intent, and success is measured by quickly users can find and buy what they need. TikTok on the other hand enables product discovery while users are watching entertaining videos, often impulse-buying items they weren’t searching for. The TikTok model treats shopping as entertainment and focuses on helping users discover things they didn't know they wanted. The platform suggests items based on trends, lifestyle, or visual appeal, where shopping becomes a leisure activity, not just a transaction. Products are discovered through influencer content, user reviews, and social features. This shift reflects changing consumer behavior, especially among younger demographics who prefer discovery and entertainment over traditional product research. It also allows platforms to introduce users to a much broader range of products than what consumers might have searched for on their own. Indeed, it is estimated that TikTok users in the U.S. have spent close to $41.3 million in the app to date, or about 55 percent of the global total, placing the US first in terms of user revenue for the app. Most users of digital platforms are completely in the dark about the extent to which platforms monetize user interactions, and in turn, how nudges and recommendations from platforms impact aggregate behavior. Social media companies primarily monetize through advertising, which relies heavily on user data to target ads effectively. Users’ personal information, behavioral patterns, and social connections are essentially the product being sold to advertisers. When users lack control over their data, they can’t make informed decisions about their digital footprint or protect sensitive information from being used in ways they didn’t anticipate. Such concentrated data ownership gives platforms significant influence over information flow, user behavior, and even democratic processes, as seen in lawmakers concerns about election interference and misinformation. Most major platforms now offer some data control options, largely due to regulations like Europe’s GDPR and California’s Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), that allow for data portability, deletion rights, and enhanced privacy settings. Under such regulations, companies are also required to publish transparency reports disclosing what data they collect and how it’s used, though these are often lengthy and technical. Despite these controls, true data ownership remains elusive because terms of service often grant platforms broad rights to use consumer data. Data deletion doesn’t necessarily remove copies used for analytics or shared with third parties. The complexity of modern data processing makes it difficult to track all uses. The key requirement from US legislation is that ByteDance must divest its control, but the specific ownership structure of the replacement entity remains flexible. It is worth noting that ByteDance’s ownership is already diversified, with 60% owned by global institutional investors such as BlackRock, General Atlantic, and Susquehanna International Group. As AI-powered search becomes more sophisticated, it could pull users away from TikTok’s discovery-driven model. While the younger generation prefers TikTok to typing queries on Google, AI assistants could reclaim this behavior by providing more personalized, conversational answers. AI also threatens TikTok's creator economy by potentially flooding the platform with synthetic content. TikTok’s core strength is its recommendation algorithm, but AI advancements could level this playing field through better personalization and cross-platform AI. New AI models can analyze user behavior across multiple platforms for superior targeting. AI could also enable entirely new types of social platforms and social interaction, such as the ability to personalize content to end users rather than just recommending existing content. Another way that AI could shape digital platforms is through enabling synthetic social experiences wherein virtual influencers and AI companions that provide entertainment without human creators. Finally, an era of integrated AI assistants could emerge where social media, search, and AI assistance converge into one experience. While the final details of the TikTok deal are being ironed out, it is worth pointing out that AI could erode TikTok’s key strengths in content creation and personalization. Here, again, though, TikTok could also have an edge in that its AI models are equipped with detailed behavioral data gathered from its users. Data could yet be the new currency in the new AI-enabled landscape.

Buy second-hand. And we are not just talking about rummaging through your local charity shop hoping to find the bargain of the century – although we are not knocking that either. In the world in which we live we have sites such as Vinted, Depop, Facebook Marketplace, eBay and many, many more. By shopping second hand – or vintage if you’d rather – you will be able to rejoice in the fact that you are very on-trend. US fashion resale was worth $15.6 billion in 2015 and is now worth $55.3 billion. Vinted is the number one retailer in France by sales volume. And we all know the French know a thing or two about style. If just 10 per cent of Irish consumers shifted a decent chunk of their spending to second-hand retailers, not only would they get some cool bargains, they would be sending a signal to fast fashion that change is necessary. If you are buying, try and buy from small, local businesses where possible. And there are many of them: Fresh Cuts in Dublin city centre; Slowstreet in Blackrock, Co Dublin; Ohh! By Gum in Clifden; Pure Clothing in Ballina; and YAWUW (you are what you wear) in Cork. If you are going to a swanky wedding or a ball in a castle or some such, rather than spending an absolute fortune on a frock you’ll wear once, why not consider renting one from the likes of Drobey, HappyDaysRental or The 105? And when you are shopping, try – in so far as it is possible – to prioritise quality over quantity and natural fibres (organic cotton, certified wool, linen) over synthetic (polyester, acrylic). When you are in shops or shopping online, look for sustainable fabric certifications such as GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standard), OCS (Organic Content Standard), RWS (Responsible Wool Standard), and RCS (Recycled Claim Standard). It is not going to solve the problem but it might go some way to not making it worse. [ Use your clothes for nine months more and reduce their environmental footprint by up to 30%Opens in new window ] It is hard to do any serious research while standing on a shop floor with a pair of jeans in your hand, so do some before you shop using resources like Good On You. It is most illuminating and easy to use. And finally, borrow from second World War Britain and make do and mend. Repairing a hole in a wool jumper saves more than 16kg of CO2e, which is the equivalent of leaving a lightbulb on for 50 days. You get to hang on to a jumper you might love, and it is just a matter of saying ‘darn it’.

Title: Sudden $200 Billion Crypto Sell-Off Sparks Fresh Bitcoin Price Crash Fears

ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. 09/22 update below. This post was originally published on September 20 Bitcoin and crypto have exploded back this year, largely thanks to BlackRock-led Wall Street adoption and U.S. president Donald Trump’s support (though fears have emerged of a bitcoin price “death spiral”). Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free crypto newsletter that will get you ahead of the market The bitcoin price topped $124,000 per bitcoin last month, though its early 2025 rally has stalled in recent months, just as Tesla billionaire Elon Musk issued a stark $37 trillion warning. Now, as Goldman Sachs quietly admits to growing fears over the U.S. dollar, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved a major rule change that could mean the bitcoin and crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) “floodgates” open. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run This week, the SEC voted in favor of proposed rule changes by three national securities exchanges, allowing them to adopt generic listing standards for new crypto ETFs. 09/22 update: The bitcoin price has fallen sharply, dropping around 3% in mere minutes and plunging under $112,000 per bitcoin from a peak of almost $118,000 just last week. "Bitcoin broke through support near $115,000, which bears had been tryingto push through since 13 September," Alex Kuptsikevich, FxPro’s chief market analyst, said in emailed comments. “In recent days, there have been several signals of a shift to a downward trend in the first cryptocurrency. BTCUSD fell out of the upward channel that had been in place since early September, dropped below horizontal support and fell sharply below the 50-day moving average. This combination of negative signals suggests a further decline is likely unless there is a fundamental change in financial market sentiment.” Bitcoin’s sudden price dive has hit the wider crypto market, wiping $200 billion from the combined market since Friday. “Bitcoin is currently entering a correction phase,” Linh Tran, a market analyst with XS.com, said in emailed comments. “This pause is seen as necessary to absorb profit-taking pressure, reduce short-term leverage, and lay the groundwork for a more stable price base.” Last week, the Federal Reserve met expectations when it cut interest rates by 25 basis points, with a reduction of interest rates generally seen to be supportive of risk assets like bitcoin and crypto—though a a nightmare scenario could send bitcoin into a “death spiral." “This signaled the end of the tightening cycle, but Fed chair Jerome Powell’s cautious remarks that future policy would remain data-dependent tempered market expectations for the pace of easing," said Tran. "This explains why bitcoin stalled, even though a lower interest rate environment typically benefits risk assets.” The bitcoin price correction was expected following last week’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, according to some analysts. “While the FOMC meeting sparked optimism for a Q4 breakout, bitcoin was more likely to enter a 1-2 week consolidation phase immediately afterward," Markus Thielen, the chief executive of 10x Research, said via email, pointing to a rise in leveraged longs that are increasingly vulnerable as liquidity thinned and raising the risk of a downside break. “On-chain metrics provide further evidence that market activity is once again fading,” Thielen added. "The real question: how long can this consolidation drag on?” The SEC approval "will open up the floodgates," Steve Feinour, a partner at Stradley Ronon, told Reuters. “The big trigger this week was the SEC’s approval of generic listing standards for crypto ETFs on the likes of NYSE, Nasdaq, and Cboe,” Nic Puckrin, macroeconomics analyst and founder of The Coin Bureau, said in emailed comments. “Until now, every ETF had to go through a lengthy, case-by-case process. Now, new products can be listed in just 75 days. This is significant for funds tied to ethereum, solana and dogecoin, or even diversified crypto baskets, as it dramatically reduces the barriers.” Alongside the rule change and proving there is demand for crypto ETFs beyond bitcoin and ethereum, the first U.S. ETFs to offer spot exposure to Ripple’s XRP and dogecoin started trading on Thursday, generating about $55 million in trading volume. The REX-Osprey XRP ETF, listed on Cboe under the ticker XRPR, saw the largest debut volume of any ETF launch this year, according an X post by Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free crypto newsletter that will get you ahead of the market In August, NovaDius Wealth president Nate Geraci said it makes “zero sense" for BlackRock to ignore cryptocurrencies beyond bitcoin and ethereum. “Otherwise, they’re basically saying bitcoin and ethereum are only ones that will ever have value. Bold,” Geraci posted to X. BlackRock’s spot bitcoin ETF exploded onto Wall Street in early 2024, becoming the fastest growing ETF ever and now holds almost 750,000 bitcoin worth $88 billion on behalf of investors. BlackRock, which manages around $10 trillion worth of assets for investors, spearheaded Wall Street’s campaign to bring a long-awaited spot bitcoin ETF to market in 2023, with its IBIT bitcoin fund dominating a fleet of funds that launched in January 2024. BlackRock’s fund alone holds almost 4% of the 21 million bitcoin that will ever exist, which some have warned could be giving BlackRock outsized control over the network.

Title: Dogecoin Price Could Break Into Double-Digit Rally From This Fibonacci Level

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. The Dogecoin price has since retraced after its run to $0.3 as sell-offs had grown stronger over the last week. There is also the fact that the Fed had cut interest rates by a quarter of a point last week, but because it was already priced into the market, there was barely any reaction to it. As such, the Dogecoin price stalled and continued to follow the established downtrend. But as the meme coin ushers in a new week, there is the possibility of a recovery and even a rally from here. Crypto analyst MadWhale outlined some notable developments surrounding the Dogecoin price and what could trigger the next wave of price action. Besides the Fed rate cuts not doing anything for the crypto market, there is also the expectation of multiple altcoin ETFs that could trigger the next rally. Recently, excitement around a possible Dogecoin ETF going live for trading has been on the rise after experts had projected a possible acceptance by the SEC last week. The decision was ultimately postponed by the regulator, but this has done nothing to dampen the excitement. The REX-Osprey Dogecoin ETF (DOJE) is still expected to go live sometime this month if the SEC gives its blessing, and the analyst explains that this could be what drives another rally. In fact, there have been expectations that the Dogecoin price could rise by up to 75%, and others have predicted that the price could double. In addition to the ETF excitement, the fact that Dogecoin whales are making their way back into the arena is exciting. With around $266 million worth of DOGE bought and withdrawn from exchanges, exchange liquidity has declined, pushing the supply down to help boost demand and trigger a possible price increase. Besides the bullish developments surrounding the Dogecoin price with the ETF filings and whale buying, there is also the technical side that points to bullishness. This is because the Dogecoin price is currently sitting close to a critical Fibonacci level. If the Dogecoin price continues to maintain both its daily support and weekly trendline above $0.24, then the analyst expects an 18% increase in price, to push it toward $0.315. Other bullish developments include the Grayscale filing with the SEC to convert its Dogecoin Trust into a full-blown ETF.

Title: BlackRock Leads Spot ETH ETF Inflows With Over $500M, Ethereum Possibly On Track To $5,000

Ethereum’s institutional narrative is strengthening as US-based Spot ETF trackers witnessed another week of inflows last week. BlackRock’s ETHA fund captured the majority of this activity with more than half a billion dollars in new investments, while other ETFs struggled with minor outflows. At the same time, technical patterns are aligning with this buying pressure, which has given many analysts confidence that the Ethereum price could be preparing to push towards its all-time high in the coming weeks. Last week was another positive week for Spot Ethereum ETFs. Across all issuers in the US, Spot Ethereum ETFs added $556.92 million in inflows during the week, making it the second consecutive week of positive institutional inflows. Cumulative inflows since launch are now over $13.9 billion, and these ETFs now hold $29.64 billion worth of Ethereum. Interestingly, data from Farside Investor’s Spot ETF tracker reveal that the majority of last week’s institutional inflows went into BlackRock’s ETHA. The inflow numbers show that BlackRock’s ETHA product absorbed roughly $513 million in net inflows between September 15 and 19. The largest portion came on Monday with over $360 million, followed by another $140 million inflow as the week drew to a close on Friday, which was enough to offset corresponding outflows from every other issuer that day. This shows how investors continue to favor BlackRock’s offering as the primary gateway for regulated Ethereum exposure. Other issuers experienced a more mixed week. Fidelity’s FETH product posted sharp redemptions, most notably $53.4 million in outflows on Friday, September 19. However, these outflows were partially balanced by $159.4 million in inflows on Thursday. Bitwise and Grayscale also witnessed days of inflows, which was enough to cancel out minor outflows during the week. Spot Ethereum ETF Flows: Farside Investors Another week of institutional inflow could set the stage for bullish price action in the new week, which in turn would certify a bullish monthly close for Ethereum in September. In fact, analyses from different analysts have looked at multiple bullish patterns forming across different timeframes on the Ethereum price chart. One particularly notable observation came from VasilyTrader on the TradingView platform, who highlighted encouraging signals on Ethereum’s shorter-term charts. His analysis of the 4-hour candlestick timeframe suggested that the recent pullback has now given way to a bullish confirmation. He identified a clear double bottom pattern that formed early last week, which was followed by a breakout from a falling wedge formation by Friday’s close. Based on these developments, VasilyTrader set his next price target at no less than $4,741. Chart Image From TradingView: VasilyTrader At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $4,485. According to crypto analyst Daan Crypto Trades, ETH is still on track to reach $5,000 as long as it holds above $4,400.

Title: The ultimate Blue Ridge Parkway road trip guide

Search The Points Guy Generated by AI with support from our editorial team. Nearly a year after Hurricane Helene rocked the southeastern U.S., the famed Blue Ridge Parkway — and many stops along its 469-mile route — is almost fully open again. This serpentine, two-lane ribbon of blacktop follows the twisting spine of the Blue Ridge Mountains (a subrange of the Appalachians) from Great Smoky Mountains National Park in North Carolina to Shenandoah National Park in Virginia. With a speed limit of 45 mph, the Blue Ridge Parkway sacrifices directness for mile after mile of untamed alpine beauty. You can hop on and off at countless junctions along the route, including two attractive midsize cities: Asheville, North Carolina (also open and welcoming tourists) and Roanoke, Virginia. But if you're up for a grand adventure and can spare a few days, it's well worth driving the entire parkway. You'll encounter remarkable diversions along the way: hundreds of scenic viewpoints and picnic spots, miles of hiking trails for every skill level and a bounty of engaging historic sites that shed light on Appalachian heritage and folkways. From south to north, here's a look at some of the most memorable stops along this magical road and helpful planning tips to get you started. Related: Not just for flights: Using points and miles to save on road trips The nearest airport to the parkway's southern tip, in the Great Smoky Mountains, is Knoxville, Tennessee's McGhee Tyson Airport (TYS), a two-hour drive. Of major airports, Charlotte Douglas International Airport (CLT) is a good option if you are planning a round-trip car rental. It's just 3 1/2 hours from the parkway's southern end point and a 4 1/2-hour drive (by the faster interstate highways) from the northern end point, at the entrance of Shenandoah. Atlanta is also 3 1/2 hours from the south end of the parkway, and the drive up through Georgia's Appalachian Mountains is quite beautiful. It's a great way to extend your adventure. From the north end of the Blue Ridge Parkway, Dulles International Airport (IAD) near Washington, D.C., is a 2 1/2-hour drive. Although there's no fee to drive the Blue Ridge Parkway, you'll need to pay $30 per private vehicle to enter Shenandoah National Park (unless you have a park pass), and Great Smoky Mountains National Park charges parking fees.

The scenery along the parkway really sings anytime from spring through fall, but May through mid-June stands out especially for viewing wildflowers and rhododendrons in bloom, and mid-September through mid-October is best for admiring brilliant fall foliage. Temperatures along the parkway tend to be five to 10 degrees lower than in the region's lower elevations, making this drive a potentially cool escape from summer heat. On the other hand, this means snow and ice are possible in winter, the one season when many facilities along the road are closed. Keep in mind that this curving and relatively narrow road is prone to fog and wild animal crossings at any time of year. It's best to drive it only during daylight hours, both for safety and the best views, and to exercise caution during heavy rain. How long does this road trip take? It's theoretically possible to drive the entire route in three days, but you'll have a far more enjoyable experience if you allow five days at a leisurely pace. With a full week, you'll have more than enough time to explore Great Smoky Mountains and Shenandoah national parks, too. The Blue Ridge Parkway begins close to the Oconaluftee Visitor Center in Great Smoky Mountains National Park. This rugged 522,419-acre swath of pristine forests, open meadows and meandering streams is the largest national park east of the Mississippi. In a single day, you can ascend to the observation tower atop 6,643-foot Clingmans Dome and explore the open-air Mountain Farm Museum — or head to the Tennessee section of the park to drive the enchanting Roaring Fork Motor Nature Trail and hop out for a short trek to Grotto Falls. Once you enter the parkway, you have about 90 miles ahead of you to Asheville. This section has some of the most dramatic scenic pullouts along the entire route, with Waterrock Knob (milepost 451) a particular highlight. There are a small visitor center and a picnic area, and the views are incredible at sunset. The other stop worth noting is Mount Pisgah (milepost 408). Allow a couple of hours for the steep but well-trodden 2.6-mile round-trip hike to this 5,721-foot peak that offers a vast panorama of nearby Asheville. After being ravaged by Hurricane Helene, the small city of Asheville is back and better than ever. With a fantastic culinary and craft beer scene and a thriving artist community, Asheville has enough to keep you busy for several days, including two notable stops along the parkway: the Blue Ridge Parkway Visitor Center, with its engrossing exhibits on the road's natural and human history, and the superb Folk Art Center (particularly Allanstand Craft Shop). In Asheville itself, set aside time to explore the greenery of The North Carolina Arboretum, peruse the galleries of the hip River Arts District (or even try your hand at an art class) and eat your way through buzzy food-and-drink neighborhoods like South Slope and West Asheville. With its chateauesque, 250-room mansion, splendid gardens and numerous other diversions, Biltmore Estate is another must — but you really need a full day to make the most of visiting this 8,000-acre property (admission starts at $70 per person). Although there are no accommodations within Great Smoky Mountains National Park, you'll find a good selection in the gateway towns of Cherokee, North Carolina (just 4 miles from the start of the Blue Ridge Parkway) and Gatlinburg, Tennessee. These mostly include no-frills options like Fairfield by Marriott Inn & Suites Cherokee (rates start at $96 or 29,000 Marriott Bonvoy points per night this fall) and Econo Lodge Inn & Suites Gatlinburg at the Convention Center (starting from $52 or 20,000 Choice Privileges points per night). Asheville offers the greatest range of points hotels along the Blue Ridge Parkway. For instance, Blind Tiger Asheville, a charming bed-and-breakfast establishment in a 19th-century Queen Anne house that's part of World of Hyatt's Mr & Mrs Smith collection, has nightly rates starting at $202 or 27,000 points this fall. Or, you could book The Radical Asheville, a hip, art-inspired Hilton Honors property in the heart of the River Arts District, starting from $141 or 45,000 points per night. Related: Best road trips for visiting national parks Just northeast of Asheville, Craggy Gardens Picnic Area (milepost 364) is a shaded tract of outdoor tables with trails leading to magnificent stands of azaleas and mountain laurels. About 10 miles later, you can briefly detour up a side road to the summit of the highest point in the eastern U.S.: Mount Mitchell. A short, paved path leads to the observation deck, and there are a small museum and a casual restaurant, too. At milepost 305, you'll approach Grandfather Mountain, which offers rocky peaks you can explore by walking across a dramatic mile-high swinging bridge. Here, you'll also drive along the parkway's greatest engineering marvel, the Linn Cove Viaduct, a curving, 1,243-foot-long concrete bridge that hugs Grandfather Mountain's precipitous face. Nearby at Julian Price Memorial Park, you can rent a kayak or canoe for a refreshing paddle around Price Lake. Also check out the quaint village center of Blowing Rock, with its gift and crafts shops, as well as the interesting Blowing Rock Art & History Museum. The charming town of Blowing Rock currently has one points hotel: Holiday Inn Express Blowing Rock South, where rates this fall start from $83 or 18,000 IHG One Rewards points per night. Other notable options include the woodsy-chic Mountainaire Inn & Log Cabins (starting around $134 per night), bookable through Chase Travel℠, and the alpine chalet-inspired Switzerland Inn (starting around $109 per night), available on Capital One Travel. Related: How the Capital One Venture X travel credit can save you $300 on your next trip As you approach Virginia, stop for lunch at the parkway's oldest eatery, The Bluffs (milepost 238), a restored 1940s rustic-style diner known for fried chicken lunches. Then, take a walk around nearby Brinegar Cabin, a small late-19th-century homestead that's typical of those that once proliferated in these mountains. Highlights after crossing the state line include the easy 2-mile-loop waterfall hike at Cumberland Knob (milepost 218) and the nearby outdoor Blue Ridge Music Center, which stages folk and country concerts throughout the summer. At historic Mabry Mill (milepost 176), you can watch docents working in the historic sawmill and blacksmith shop and dine in the colorful restaurant (known for its freshly baked blackberry cobbler). You'll encounter the turnoff for picturesque Mill Mountain Greenway, which leads into Roanoke, at milepost 120. Stop at Mill Mountain Park for a grand view of the city, save time for a walk through the small zoo and garden, if possible, on your way into town. Give yourself at least a half day to get to know this bustling hill city with several first-rate attractions, including the Taubman Museum of Art, which is focused on regional American works, and the O. Winston Link Museum, with its railway photography housed inside a vintage train station. Pick up locally sourced food at Historic Roanoke City Market, and hunt for Appalachian antiques and architectural wares at famed Black Dog Salvage. Roanoke makes for a convenient overnight base, and it offers a few lodging options bookable with points. The Hotel Roanoke & Conference Center stands out for its 1880s Tudor-style design and its refined restaurant serving French cuisine with a Southern twist. You can book it for as low as $194 or 58,000 Hilton Honors points per night this fall. And you can get solid value for your World of Hyatt points at the Category 1 Hyatt Place Roanoke Airport/Valley View Mall (from $94 or 3,500 points per night). From Roanoke, you have about 115 miles left to go. Make time for a detour into the cute hamlet of Buchanan, Virginia, where you can venture across a vintage swinging bridge over the James River, and stop for a hike along one of the easy but rewarding trails at the Peaks of the Otter area (milepost 86). At milepost 0, the Blue Ridge Parkway ends on an overpass above Interstate Highway 64. Or, to be more precise, it transitions into Skyline Drive, the 105-mile scenic route through Shenandoah National Park. This curvaceous and lofty thoroughfare feels quite similar to the Blue Ridge Parkway. The main difference is that the speed limit is lower (35 mph), and you'll pay a $30-per-vehicle fee to enter the park (unless you hold an America the Beautiful Pass or visit on a fee-free day). Related: 10 of the best national parks to visit in the fall If you're ending your trip at the parkway's northern terminus, it's an easy drive on I-64 to Staunton, Virginia (20 minutes west) or Charlottesville, Virginia (30 minutes east), which offer a few points hotels. For example, the Avid Hotel Staunton is available from $92 or 19,000 IHG One Rewards points per night this fall, and Hyatt Place Charlottesville starts at $110 or 8,000 World of Hyatt points per night. If continuing along Skyline Drive through Shenandoah National Park, consider staying in one of its handful of hotels. Some of these are available on various credit card travel portals, but they fill up fast, so book ahead. There's something special about waking up in a room high atop the park's 3,500-foot-elevation spine, with panoramic views west toward the Allegheny Mountains. Now that most major repairs have been made in the wake of Hurricane Helene, the Blue Ridge Parkway has reopened for road trips — and fall is a prime time to go. Besides everything mentioned above, you'll enjoy the added benefit of spectacular fall foliage during your drive and any hikes you take. If leaf peeping is your aim, you'll have the best chance at seeing peak colors if you drive the parkway between mid-October and early November.

Title: Strategy and the centralization question: what happens when one firm holds 3% (or 7%) of all Bitcoin?

As Strategy continues to amass Bitcoin with the appetite of a hungry hippo, just how much is too much for a single entity to hold? Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Welcome to Slate Sundays, CryptoSlate’s new weekly feature showcasing in-depth interviews, expert analysis, and thought-provoking op-eds that go beyond the headlines to explore the ideas and voices shaping the future of crypto. On Wall Street and Crypto Twitter, few names spark debate like Michael Saylor and his Bitcoin-hungry software company, Strategy. Gone are the days when MicroStrategy was just a business intelligence software vendor. Today, “Strategy” stands as the world’s biggest corporate Bitcoin holder, packing away more than 638,900 BTC (3% of the total circulating supply). For some Bitcoiners, Saylor’s conviction is a validation of the king of crypto’s coming-of-age as an institutional reserve asset. For critics, it’s a warning: centralization risk, wrapped in a narrative. So, where does the truth lie, and just how much supply is too much for any single entity? It wasn’t always clear this day would come. In the early days, Bitcoin was for nerdy devs, quasi-religious cypherpunks, and early adopters. Today, one NASDAQ-listed firm sits atop a pile of digital gold that overshadows that of BlackRock, Tesla, and Coinbase combined. It’s not just about numbers. As Nic Puckrin, CEO and founder at Coin Bureau, points out: “Having a NASDAQ-listed firm owning such a large allocation of BTC shows that Bitcoin has moved from the fringe to the spotlight of mainstream corporate finance… For institutions still hesitant, Strategy’s holdings act as a powerful signal, telling others that a publicly traded firm can allocate billions of dollars to BTC, and so can you.” Bitcoin has firmly entered the institutional era. For treasuries and pension funds searching for alternatives to cash, Strategy’s lead acts as a proof-of-concept. But this milestone also swings the conversation back to first principles. Bitcoin was designed as a decentralized network, immune to the grip of any single company, country, or billionaire. What happens when one firm not only holds a massive position but relentlessly targets more? Saylor has alluded to ambitions as high as 7% of the total supply on numerous occasions. Make no mistake, Strategy’s holdings have shifted market dynamics. The float is tighter, and with so much supply boxed up in long-term corporate treasuries, the supply shock theory is very real. And that’s a double-edged sword. Tony Yazbeck, cofounder of The Bitcoin Way, comments: “MicroStrategy owning over 3% of Bitcoin isn’t a threat to the network itself, but it does carry some market implications. The main concern is influence. As a large holder, he may be able to sway sentiment and trigger price swings.” For institutional Bitcoin evangelists, Strategy’s success is a green light, the mainstream embrace they’ve argued for since Bitcoin’s early days. Investment veteran and e-Cobalt founder Mitchell DiRaimondo says: “Others will catch on, and when they do, 3% will seem like just the beginning of a much larger shift in capital.” DiRaimondo sees Saylor’s conviction as transformative: “His approach has always been solid: stock up on hard money, ignore the noise, and get ready for long-term adoption.” While Puckrin also celebrates Strategy’s achievement, he warns that cascading liquidations could be a real threat: “Despite the positivity, we can’t ignore the clear risks here… If, for any reason, Strategy is forced to liquidate even a fraction of its holdings, the impact on market confidence would be profound.” And that risk isn’t just theoretical. The last few years have seen failed treasury plays, sudden liquidations, and gut-wrenching moments when Bitcoin’s price fell off a cliff triggered by the actions of a few unscrupulous firms. FTX anyone? What are the other risks of concentrated holdings? As long-time Bitcoin advocate and security expert Jameson Lopp previously told Slate Sundays: “If too much Bitcoin gets concentrated in too few hands, we run the risk of essentially recreating a highly centralized system.” That’s why Lopp decided to invest in David Bailey’s Bitcoin Treasury company, Nakamoto, to prevent Strategy from pulling so much further ahead. “It’s not because I think that corporate Bitcoin treasury adoption is the best thing since sliced bread. It’s because I felt like we needed to have a broader and more diverse group of corporate treasuries to compete with Saylor, to try to slow down how much he can continue accumulating.” Bitcoin was built to withstand centralized attacks, but the question isn’t whether one company can break Bitcoin. It’s about how market perception changes when one player becomes the story. Wes Kaplan, former Cointelegraph CEO and current CEO of G-Knot, comments: “Unlike individual holders who sell gradually, these entities operate with fiduciary responsibilities to shareholders and creditors. When market stress hits, these companies can face margin calls and creditor demands regardless of their Bitcoin conviction. Multiple leveraged players selling simultaneously could create cascading liquidations.” This isn’t just about market drama. It’s about dilution, fragility, and interconnected risk. Matt Mudano, CEO of Arch Network, sees the bigger picture, questioning how the centralization of the Bitcoin supply affects miners. He notes: “As more trading migrates to ETFs, centralized venues, and OTC desks, fewer coins actually settle on-chain. That siphons liquidity from the on-chain market that funds miners via fees. With block subsidies shrinking, a durable fee market is what keeps miners profitable, and a broad mining base is key to Bitcoin’s decentralization.” Macro analyst and Bitcoin advocate Lyn Alden holds a different view. She’s not concerned about the centralization of the Bitcoin supply, pointing out that the dynamics have always been this way: Mt. Gox had over 800,000 coins, a bigger percentage than BlackRock or Strategy has now. Alden looks to leverage as the main culprit for systems to unravel, telling Slate Sundays: “MicroStrategy has pretty low leverage relative to their Bitcoin. Metaplanet has relatively low leverage relative to their Bitcoin. We’ll see how the others come as they go. I certainly think that we’ll see a washout. We’ll see a lot of altcoin treasury companies get washed out, and some Bitcoin ones that are poorly managed are going to be at risk in the next downturn.” Alden’s thoughts are echoed by OG Bitcoiner, CEO, and cofounder of BitcoinOS, Edan Yago. He says: “I don’t see Strategy’s move of buying BTC as a problem. In fact, it reflects a long-term alignment with Bitcoin’s principles. Unlike speculative holders, this puts a lot of BTC in the hands of a long-term holder. Strategy is showing the world that Bitcoin is an institutional-grade treasury asset. This provides a stability that creates stronger demand dynamics and actually makes Bitcoin’s supply more resilient.” Mudano’s take is somewhat more cautious, reminding Bitcoiners to see the bigger picture rather than get blinded by NGU. “Cheer conviction buyers like Saylor, but watch the plumbing: how encumbered those holdings are, who the custodians are, and whether miners’ fee share of revenue is rising. Deep on‑chain activity, not just big holders, is what ultimately secures the network.” 2025 is a certainly a year of inflection for Bitcoin. Strategy remains the largest non-sovereign treasury by a country mile. Metaplanet in Japan is stacking BTC as “Asia’s MicroStrategy.” And Nakamoto is grabbing headlines with the annihilation of its shares, down a horrifying 96% from their May highs. Meanwhile, governments, ETFs, and exchanges now command close to a third of all circulating Bitcoin supply, and data from Glassnode shows that only 14-15% of Bitcoin is truly liquid, adding gravity to every move by the major players. The risk? Systemic fragility if one or two whales face margin calls or liquidity constraints. Are we building the very vulnerabilities that Bitcoin was designed to eliminate? Counterparty risk, custody structures, and treasury strategies will all face their moment of truth. So, is Strategy’s position good or bad? The answer, as ever, is nuanced. For some, it’s the clearest sign yet that Bitcoin is maturing; a reserve-grade asset fit for institutional balance sheets. For others, it’s a warning to stay vigilant about concentration, transparency, and systemic risk. As Yago points out: “Bitcoin thrives because it’s held by those who understand its scarcity and value… Bitcoin cannot be ‘controlled’ by one entity… It is designed to be completely decentralized, and ownership concentration does not change that.” What matters most? Not whether one company can buy its way to dominance, but whether ownership (and stewardship) remains diverse. The ethos that started this revolution was decentralization. If corporate and sovereign funds dominate the ledger, Bitcoin’s next chapter will depend on how they wield their power and what happens when the tides inevitably turn. Alex Gladstein, Chief Strategy Officer at the Human Rights Foundation, succinctly sums up the mood: “Let’s remember why we are here Cypherpunks write code Thank an open-source developer today Wall Street didn’t create and sustain NGU, Satoshi and the cypherpunks did and will” In the end, Bitcoin’s resilience won’t be measured by how much Strategy owns, but by how well the ecosystem adapts, expanding supply across corporates, institutions, and individuals. That’s what keeps Bitcoin true to form, and what will define whether it remains the people’s money… or the plaything of the corporate elite.

Title: CZ's Family Office Deepens Stake in Ethena Labs as USDe Stablecoin Supply Tops $13B

YZi Labs, the family office founded by Binance co-founder Changpeng "CZ" Zhao and Yi He, which was rebranded from Binance Labs, has expanded its position in Ethena Labs, the protocol behind USDe, which has become the third-largest U.S. dollar-denominated crypto asset with more than $13 billion in circulation. The investment comes as Ethena enters a new stage of growth, which includes extending its footprint on BNB Chain. This includes rolling out products designed to bridge crypto and traditional finance, such as USDtb, a fiat-backed stablecoin in development, and Converge, an institutional settlement layer being built with Securitize and partners connected to BlackRock. USDe, marketed as a "synthetic dollar," uses bitcoin BTC, ETH$4,183.84 and Solana's SOL (SOL)as backing assets, pairing them with an equal value of short perpetual futures positions on exchanges to maintain a $1 peg. Launched less than two years ago, the synthetic dollar crossed the $10 billion supply milestone faster than any other dollar-pegged crypto asset. “Since our investment team first met Guy [Young] in late 2023, Ethena has become the category definer for yield-bearing synthetic dollars,” said Dana Hou, investment partner at YZi Labs. For users, the developments mean more options for holding and using digital dollars across centralized exchanges and decentralized finance protocols. For institutions, products like Converge aim to create a familiar settlement layer for tokenized assets, potentially broadening adoption of on-chain financial infrastructure.

Title: Ethereum ETFs Register $557 Million Inflows As BlackRock Leads The Charge

According to data from SoSoValue, the Ethereum spot ETFs saw another strong week of bullish trading activity in the third week of September, recording $556.92 million in net inflows. While the figure is slightly below the $637.79 million inflows registered during the second week, the performance underscores sustained investor appetite for Ethereum exposure through regulated institutional vehicles. Despite the rocky start to the month, marked by $787.74 million in net outflows during the first week of September, Ethereum ETFs have now swung back into positive territory, with a cumulative September net deposit of $406.97 million. In analyzing the Ethereum ETFs’ performance for the last week, BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) continues to establish itself as the dominant player, after recording an impressive $513.01 million in net inflows, i.e, more than 92% of total ETH ETF inflows. With this momentum, BlackRock’s ETHA now holds $13.40 billion in cumulative inflows and $17.09 billion in net assets under management (AUM), reinforcing its position as the clear market leader. In usual fashion, other funds lagged well behind in comparison. Grayscale’s Ethereum Mini Trust (ETH) posted a distant second with $17.99 million in net inflows, followed by Fidelity’s FETH with $15.18 million. Other ETFs with significant traction included Grayscale’s legacy ETHE trust, which added $13.60 million, and Bitwise’s ETHW, which attracted $7.52 million. However, not all funds shared in the positive momentum as VanEck’s ETHV lost $8.16 million while Invesco’s QETH saw a minor $1.73 million in outflows, highlighting uneven performance across the sector. Taken together, all Ethereum ETFs now report $29.64 billion in total net assets, supported by $13.29 billion in cumulative inflows. The latest numbers demonstrate that despite volatility in ETH spot prices and mixed performance among smaller ETFs, overall institutional demand for Ethereum remains robust. With BlackRock’s ETHA capturing the lion’s share of flows, its performance will likely remain a bellwether for the sector. If sustained, these inflows would continue to position Ethereum ETFs as a central driver of Ethereum’s institutional adoption heading into 2026.

Similar to its Ethereum ETF counterpart, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) dominated the market once again, leading with $866.84 million in aggregate inflows. At the time of writing, total net assets across all Bitcoin ETFs now stand at $152.31 billion, representing 6.63% of Bitcoin’s total market capitalization. Meanwhile, cumulative inflows have reached $57.72 billion. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Fears of a tech bubble have it backward. Stocks can keep going.

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. The stock market may be feeling a little bubbly, but it is nothing like the parabolic, internet-hyped tech trade of the late 1990s. Oracle’s near 40% one-day surge last week on a bullish forecast stirred up memories of that frothy period—and some concern about excess AI optimism. But there is a big difference between now and the stock market party of 1999: Companies now are making real money. Back then, “the price performance was insane," said Dan Greenhaus, strategist at Solus Alternative Asset Management. “Stocks were splitting multiple times a year because the appreciation was so great." “Everything was going public, whether they had any sales or not. There was a level of enthusiasm across markets and sectors that really doesn’t feel similar to today." Today’s major tech companies are pricey, but nowhere close to “dot-com bubble valuations," Greenhaus said. The bull market could run longer. Famously, former Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan used the term “irrational exuberance" to describe elevated asset prices in December 1996, years before the market peaked. Tech stocks tied to AI are benefiting from real impacts on their earnings. Market darling Nvidia “keeps going up in general, but it isn’t getting more expensive," Greenhaus said. The stock’s rise is driven by “extreme earnings and sales revisions," not just valuations, he said. Oracle’s big stock move came after the company reported an AI revenue forecast much stronger than the market expected. It now sees its cloud infrastructure revenue reaching $144 billion over the next four years, up from a projected $18 billion this fiscal year. The companies driving the market today “have so much excess cash flow that they’re buying back their stock," said Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock. “They can still spend on capital expenditure and research and development, and they still have plenty of money to buy back their stocks. That was the exact opposite of the tech bubble," Rieder said. Rieder said AI adoption is “an extraordinary expenditure that is changing the economic landscape" with the power to bring about huge gains in productivity. The breadth of the AI trade is also much greater than the internet and Y2K focused trade of the late 1990s and early 2000. Stocks that were considered “old economy" at the time traded with low valuations, while internet-related plays commanded sky high premiums. The market is treating AI innovation differently. Evercore ISI describes its influence on stocks as a “participatory democracy," with the potential to benefit the companies that create it, support it, and use it. AI can create winners across industries, well beyond tech. The firm notes that a quarter of companies are adopting AI just three years after the public launch of ChatGPT. During the last two years of the tech bubble, more stocks were going down daily than were rising, signaling a serious deterioration in the health of the market, according to Evercore ISI. That is opposite what is happening now, with more stocks advancing, taking indexes higher. The broader profit picture is also different. “Intel, Sun Micro, Cisco, Microsoft, the big guys were profitable then. It was the huge satellite of peripheral companies that weren’t profitable," Greenhaus said. Amazon, one of the tech heavyweights in the Magnificent 7, wasn’t profitable during the tech bubble. Its first quarterly profit was in 2021. “The best money wasn’t made on the companies that were building the internet. The best money was made on the companies that became the business because of the internet. Amazon, for instance," Greenhaus said. Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, said she is seeing some signs of froth in the market. But she believes the bull market will continue. “When sentiment gets to the frothier end of the spectrum, that sentiment can last for a long time," said Sonders. While the Magnificent 7 stocks have fueled much of the gains in the S&P 500, the tech giants, including Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Meta, aren’t the biggest gainers in the stock market this year, she notes. Meta is the best performing Mag 7 stock in the S&P 500, but it is the 57th best performing stock in the S&P, while Alphabet was 58th, according to Schwab. Sonders said she currently isn’t recommending specific sectors, or even just high-quality stocks. She sees “opportunity a little bit down the quality spectrum into some of the more value-oriented areas, but you don’t want to sacrifice decent growth opportunities." She looks for factors like positive earnings revisions, positive earnings surprises, low price-to-book, low-price-to-sales, and amount of free cash flow. Some strategists have been expecting a correction to tamp down some of the market’s enthusiasm. Sonders said there has been a rolling correction across the market. She notes the S&P 500 was down 19% at its low point this year, while at the average member level, the drawdown was 25% from the year-to-date highs. The S&P quickly recovered and went on to set new highs. Sonders said the biggest gainers of the Nasdaq currently include small, lesser-known stocks. “There are retail traders’ fingerprints all over this market move. They are sort of full steam ahead—and they buy the dip, buy every little dip. And so at some point you could argue, the music ends. But it could last awhile."

Title: Gina London: I’m taking my leadership lessons from my local shopping-centre car park

THE COMMUNICATOR Gina London with Daniel Zaragoza Almost every day, I find myself at my local shopping centre in Blackrock Village, just outside Dublin. Sometimes it’s for a grocery run and a chat with cashier Brian. Other times it’s a quick trip to the hardware store and a lively conversation with shopkeeper Josh. I appreciate all the friendly people I interact with there – but there’s one interaction that always gives me a lift even before I step inside. It happens in the basement car park. As I pull in, I am greeted by a wave and the smiling face of Daniel Zaragoza, who manages the car valet service. He doesn’t just welcome me; he greets every regular customer like an old friend. Daniel is a fixture. His warmth is matched by the upbeat music he always plays which fills the air with surround sound and the little Christmas tree that brightens his car wash station with year-round twinkling lights. The whole scene is festive and somehow reassuring. So I wanted to learn more about the man behind the ever-present smile. We met over an early morning coffee at the nearby Starbuck’s. Daniel shared how his life began in the heart of Mexico city. The youngest of six, he lost his father when he was just a year old and his mother by the time he was 12. His eldest sister, only 21 at the time, stepped in to help raise him and his siblings. Life wasn’t easy, but Daniel worked in barbershops and restaurants while still attending school, eventually graduating from high school. By the time he was 19, he had a full-time job at KFC as a cashier. One manager saw his potential and invited him to join the franchise’s main office. “Of course, I said yes,” Daniel remembered. For four years, he crisscrossed Mexico city, delivering checks and contracts, learning responsibility and resilience on the job. Daniel became a father at 21. With his girlfriend and young son, he decided to look abroad for opportunity and adventure. A man passed by wearing a T-shirt that read: ‘Kiss me, I’m Irish.’ That was my sign “We went as tourists,” he says of their first trip to Canada. They eventually secured residency in Toronto, where he worked nights in hotel maintenance and studied English in the mornings. Nine years brought a daughter and job promotions – culminating in responsibility for a team of eight and a second job managing maintenance for an office complex. But when the clock ran out on his Canadian residency, he returned to Mexico, this time to Cancun. Hotels, nightclubs, and restaurant jobs kept him afloat, but he longed for something more. Over coffee one day, he told a friend he wanted to move to Europe. “My friend asked me which country I would like to go to – and at that very moment, a man passed by wearing a T-shirt that read: ‘Kiss me, I’m Irish.’ That was my sign,” he says with a laugh. Within a month, Daniel and his eldest sister were on a plane to Dublin. She was studying, and he was ready for a new start. In 2016, he found work at the Blackrock Shopping Centre car park. “I had never even been to Blackrock before,” he recalled. He started at the car wash on a trial basis. Within two days, his managers offered him the role permanently. Today, nine years later, he’s the manager, overseeing a team of 11 at No H2O Detailers. What sets Daniel apart is not just the quality of his work but his approach to people. His years in hospitality have taught him that the customer experience is what matters most. “I try to make each car wash special,” he shared. “It’s not just about a clean car. It’s about how you receive people, how you smile at them, how you listen.” His attention to detail is unwavering. He personally checks each vehicle to ensure it meets his standards. He also adds personal touches – sometimes it’s a small chocolate, sometimes he’ll give a hug – but whatever it is, it’s consistently kind. And customers notice. He told me that he has some clients who travel for business from France and England and stop in monthly, just to see him. Others, like me, ask for his playlist, which consists of an eclectic mix including Canadian band Men I Trust, the group Cannons, and plenty of Seventies and Eighties rock. I see a life story of resilience, adaptability, and purpose Life has had its share of challenges. His relationship with his children’s mother ended when they were young, and she returned to Mexico with them. But Daniel later reconnected and remains close. His son, now 25, lives in Kildare and manages a car wash of his own. His daughter lives in Canada. Daniel recently secured Irish residency and looks forward to attending his citizenship ceremony next year. He and his son are also quietly working on an entrepreneurial project together – details still under wraps. When I ask what motivates him, Daniel’s answer is simple: “My goal is to make one person happy every day. When people smile back, I feel rewarded. That’s the payback.” Each time I pull into the Blackrock Centre’s car park, I see more than a friendly smile. I see a life story of resilience, adaptability, and purpose. Daniel Zaragoza’s journey from Mexico City to Dublin is a reminder that no matter where we start, or what obstacles we face, we can choose to create joy and community wherever we stand – even in an underground car park.

ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. 09/22 update below. This post was originally published on September 20 Bitcoin and crypto have exploded back this year, largely thanks to BlackRock-led Wall Street adoption and U.S. president Donald Trump’s support (though fears have emerged of a bitcoin price “death spiral”). Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free crypto newsletter that will get you ahead of the market The bitcoin price topped $124,000 per bitcoin last month, though its early 2025 rally has stalled in recent months, just as Tesla billionaire Elon Musk issued a stark $37 trillion warning. Now, as Goldman Sachs quietly admits to growing fears over the U.S. dollar, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved a major rule change that could mean the bitcoin and crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) “floodgates” open. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run This week, the SEC voted in favor of proposed rule changes by three national securities exchanges, allowing them to adopt generic listing standards for new crypto ETFs. 09/22 update: The bitcoin price has fallen sharply, dropping around 3% in mere minutes and plunging under $112,000 per bitcoin from a peak of almost $118,000 just last week. "Bitcoin broke through support near $115,000, which bears had been tryingto push through since 13 September," Alex Kuptsikevich, FxPro’s chief market analyst, said in emailed comments. “In recent days, there have been several signals of a shift to a downward trend in the first cryptocurrency. BTCUSD fell out of the upward channel that had been in place since early September, dropped below horizontal support and fell sharply below the 50-day moving average. This combination of negative signals suggests a further decline is likely unless there is a fundamental change in financial market sentiment.” Bitcoin’s sudden price dive has hit the wider crypto market, wiping $200 billion from the combined market since Friday. “Bitcoin is currently entering a correction phase,” Linh Tran, a market analyst with XS.com, said in emailed comments. “This pause is seen as necessary to absorb profit-taking pressure, reduce short-term leverage, and lay the groundwork for a more stable price base.” Last week, the Federal Reserve met expectations when it cut interest rates by 25 basis points, with a reduction of interest rates generally seen to be supportive of risk assets like bitcoin and crypto—though a a nightmare scenario could send bitcoin into a “death spiral." “This signaled the end of the tightening cycle, but Fed chair Jerome Powell’s cautious remarks that future policy would remain data-dependent tempered market expectations for the pace of easing," said Tran. "This explains why bitcoin stalled, even though a lower interest rate environment typically benefits risk assets.” The bitcoin price correction was expected following last week’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, according to some analysts. “While the FOMC meeting sparked optimism for a Q4 breakout, bitcoin was more likely to enter a 1-2 week consolidation phase immediately afterward," Markus Thielen, the chief executive of 10x Research, said via email, pointing to a rise in leveraged longs that are increasingly vulnerable as liquidity thinned and raising the risk of a downside break. “On-chain metrics provide further evidence that market activity is once again fading,” Thielen added. "The real question: how long can this consolidation drag on?” The SEC approval "will open up the floodgates," Steve Feinour, a partner at Stradley Ronon, told Reuters. “The big trigger this week was the SEC’s approval of generic listing standards for crypto ETFs on the likes of NYSE, Nasdaq, and Cboe,” Nic Puckrin, macroeconomics analyst and founder of The Coin Bureau, said in emailed comments. “Until now, every ETF had to go through a lengthy, case-by-case process. Now, new products can be listed in just 75 days. This is significant for funds tied to ethereum, solana and dogecoin, or even diversified crypto baskets, as it dramatically reduces the barriers.” Alongside the rule change and proving there is demand for crypto ETFs beyond bitcoin and ethereum, the first U.S. ETFs to offer spot exposure to Ripple’s XRP and dogecoin started trading on Thursday, generating about $55 million in trading volume. The REX-Osprey XRP ETF, listed on Cboe under the ticker XRPR, saw the largest debut volume of any ETF launch this year, according an X post by Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free crypto newsletter that will get you ahead of the market In August, NovaDius Wealth president Nate Geraci said it makes “zero sense" for BlackRock to ignore cryptocurrencies beyond bitcoin and ethereum. “Otherwise, they’re basically saying bitcoin and ethereum are only ones that will ever have value. Bold,” Geraci posted to X. BlackRock’s spot bitcoin ETF exploded onto Wall Street in early 2024, becoming the fastest growing ETF ever and now holds almost 750,000 bitcoin worth $88 billion on behalf of investors. BlackRock, which manages around $10 trillion worth of assets for investors, spearheaded Wall Street’s campaign to bring a long-awaited spot bitcoin ETF to market in 2023, with its IBIT bitcoin fund dominating a fleet of funds that launched in January 2024. BlackRock’s fund alone holds almost 4% of the 21 million bitcoin that will ever exist, which some have warned could be giving BlackRock outsized control over the network.

So the key points are: – It will now cost $100k to apply for an H-1B visa – This rule is in force for 12 months and will cease to apply unless renewed (these two points are being incorrectly reported in some places as a $100k annual fee) – If you are well connected, you can get the government to agree to an exemption on either an individual, company or industry basis. Assuming this goes ahead, it’s going to kill the Infosys/Wipro model pretty much dead (not that anybody will shed tears for it). It would probably also harm the big US tech companies like Amazon and Microsoft, except that Trump claims they’re supportive, so if he’s not blowing smoke then that probably means they have their Section 2c exemptions lined up already. As for smaller businesses (namely any without a hotline to the Secretary of Homeland Security) H-1B will be pretty much dead for them as well.

Yeah, measles vaccination isn’t perfect, but it sure beats the alternatives. The measles vaccination schedule in Australia works like this: – if you were born before 1966 you almost certainly have immunity from getting measles as a kid, and don’t need to be vaccinated. – if you were born between 1966 and 1994 you almost certainly had one dose of measles vaccine as a kid, and have 95% percent chance of being immune. – if you were born after 1994 you almost certainly got (or will get) two doses of vaccine, and have (will have) a 99% percent chance of being immune. – if you’re in the 1966 to 1994 group, you should get a second shot if you work in healthcare, schools or childcare, or are close to someone vulnerable (eg immunocompromised, elderly) – if you’ve come to Australia from overseas and don’t have evidence of vaccination you should get two shots. The people infected in the outbreaks you highlight are almost certainly: – born between 1966 and 1994, and only had one shot; – kids who haven’t had their second shot yet; or – people from overseas who haven’t had two shots (or measles as a kid) – vaccine avoiders These are outbreaks, not epidemics. They involve a few people, but don’t spread much. They’re rare enough to make the national news. https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/measles/Pages/measles-vax-qanda.aspx The company I used to work for used H1bs for a while then they decided to buy an office in India. No more H1bs anymore. Funny thing, the company has no business in India only USA, but they enjoy the special privileges of their business type classification all the while paying engineers in India a pittance compared to the USA. Quality shows after reporting of a 100% turnover rate in the India office and several failed projects. But they keep doing it. I was laid off at 59 from a large multi-national American company that everyone here has heard of and probably has one of their products. I was let go, along with about 113 others, in the second wave of cuts back in 2017. There were more cuts after that. Our entire IT department had been outsourced to an Indian company, and it cost us tons of American and local jobs, not sure how many. My boss, who worked at the corporate Mothership told me the engineering tech center, which we were a part of, had been “invaded” by H1B people. His words, not mine. They took over most of these jobs that were lost. I was replaced by one. The company was trying to get younger (and cheaper) it seems. By law, as I was told, they had to show us who was getting the axe, their ages, and who wasn’t. All, and I mean all, of the 113 were 58 to 64. One job class had 6 layoffs, all 63 or 64. We had 45 days to sign the separation agreement or get nothing. You could not sue the company for age discrimination (this was in bold). You could not work, due to confidentiality agreements, in the same field for 1 year. We got insurance for about 6 months, a pissy little severance, a pat on the ass, and a see ya. Funny, same day I get whacked, corporate reported record earnings, their stock went up about 17 percent that day, (layoff notices probably helped) and they announced a 4 million dollar expansion to our manufacturing facility. They did most of the hiring for factory labor through staffing contractors, for the record. A lean mean money making machine. Too bad you didn’t get a lawyer. The part about not being able to sue the company for age discrimination sounds illegal, or at least evidence of deception as that is not the law in my state. Sounds like intimidation. You always have the right to sue unless you signed that away in some sort of binding arbitration clause, which may or may not be legal. Of course, whether a lawsuit would succeed is another matter, but I have heard from several employment lawyers that just threatening to sue suddenly results in a lot bigger severance offer appearing like manna from Heaven. It just so happened my girlfriend at the time worked for a law firm. One of their lawyers offered to look it over for me. He gave me a few tips on what I might be able to negotiate with them – age discrimination not one of them. He said there was nothing I could do. I tried to negotiate on some other things. They told me to sign it or STFU. I don’t know if living in Ohio has anything to do with it. I’m told Ohio has some kind of law that you can fire someone for little or no reason and there is no recourse. I don’t know if this is true, but…. I have a family member who is fighting cancer. She’s has just spent the last few months in chemo. It’s knocking the shit out of her, to be blunt. She had 3 treatments to go and she got fired from her job, and lost her insurance. She worked from home, which was lucky for her, but not now. They said there was nothing they can do. They are not only afraid of what will happen with her health, but afraid they will now lose their house. Don’t get old or sick… I’m sorry about your family member. That’s awful. Did she look into taking FMLA medical leave? That’s the law, and while they don’t have to pay you while you’re on leave, they have to at least restore you to your position when you return from the mandatory leave period, or put you in a comparable one. And while they can technically fire you 3 seconds after giving you your old job back for cause, well, that looks very bad in court. Like, “retaliation” bad. Employment lawyers love that stuff. As so often is the case with the law, there are lots of grey areas to keep lawyers employed. When I got laid off in 2022, the company made a big show of publishing the ages of everyone on the list, including myself. I was the oldest. I did negotiate a better deal for myself, almost by accident (long story for another day.) Perhaps you wouldn’t have had a case, but you’d be surprised what being served does to people. Having a process server march into corporate HQ and demand to see the head of HR with a stack of papers gets their attention. Just to save the legal costs, they’ll change their tune like Tweety Bird! I don’t know about the FMLA stuff. Too late now anyway. They are just trying to cope, move on and hope for the best. Thanks for that just the same. I didn’t fight the layoff. I found work within a month. That got me to 62 and got laid off again. At that age, in my field, you are no longer employable so, like it or not, I took early retirement while trying to find a job which I didn’t. I’m sorry to here about these bouts of economic terrorism. One thing that Naked Capitalism has taught me: there but for the grace of God go I. (A phrase I actually picked up from the Earl Dumarest SciFi series of books by Tubb. Kind of entertaining, but a bit repetitive with extremely 1-dimensional female characters.) But it’s hard to prepare for every contingency in neoliberalism. You do the best that you can. Stay safe! Not my area of expertise (most things aren’t) but found this interesting breakdown by percentage of H1B holders in various industries. https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/document/reports/OLA_Signed_H-1B_Characteristics_Congressional_Report_FY2023.pdf (List on page 13 of the PDF) Had no idea the vast majority of them (65%) are in tech. Can see why that industry could use this change to allow more opportunities for American workers. Curious what this will do to already labor-starved industries like hospitals though. From my experience at two different companies, they wanted them because they were cheaper. Allow me to explain one example. This was a different multi-national than the one above, but still the same IMO. Our engineering department wanted to ship our work to a company in India. We had a couple of dozen in the department that was targeted. When they told us it was just for those times when we were too busy and time to market was important. We needed more people. We didn’t buy this. It was about replacing us at some point. Once they told us the plan, I did some research and created a proposal that proved, making some changes to our process, and some additional training and cost (hardware) we could in fact handle these peak demands. I took the presentation to one of the brain(less) trust. I laid it all out, piece by piece, proving we would be wasting money by outsourcing our jobs and/or labor, even for peak demand. He let me finish, laughed, and said; “I can get three of those people for one of you, why do I need you.” At least he was honest. To make a long story short, we hired a Indian company. They sent a couple people over here. We trained them over the next 6 to 8 months, then they went back and trained 8 or 10 of their people, who began doing our work. Within 6 months, our department lost some people, but our workload didn’t change. We spent as much time checking, and FIXING, their work as if we would have just done it ourselves. It probably took a year, and who knows how much money spent, to finally figure out (and admit) this was a truly bad experiment. They fired the other company, then of course we had to find new people to hire because we got rid of some we had. The company lost their butts. We only shook our heads. Another giant cluster by our corporate overlords. This is similar to my own experience. Former employer not only went looking for engineers in India, but actually had an office building constructed in Bangalore. We learned via a manager who talked too much that they were salivating at the prospect of getting engineers at one-third the cost (i.e., the same “three of those people for one of you” ratio). Management was even brazen enough to send us some CVs, asking: “can this person do your job?” I happened to see one of these CVs. Degree in “Software Configuration” from M.I.T., which in this case meant the Madras Institute of Technology. But what struck me was that the candidate had worked for eight different companies in the past two years. At first, this was a head-scratcher. We told management: “this person cannot do the job without training. We could hire and train them, but given their work history, why would we expect them to hang around?” Needless to say, these management decisions had a severe impact on morale and a number of the best engineers left the company. And then I heard from management that things in India weren’t working out so well. They would hire somebody, and then on the appointed starting date, the new hire wouldn’t show up. The office would phone them, only to learn — “oh, sorry, I forgot to inform you” — the new hire already had taken another job somewhere else. It seems that very often when a person was hired, they would immediately put that on their CV and go looking for another job at higher pay. There were some other things that went quite contrary to US management expectations, and within a couple of years the office in India was closed, the building was sold, and the whole adventure was forgotten. In my last role I had to do some IT recruiting over a period of 3 years to keep my team staffed up. I went for permanent hires and intra-company transfers when I could but sometimes had to look further afield, or we sometimes had people thrust upon us (as a “favour”). This was 12 -15 years ago. I found that we had two sorts of analyst programmers hired with an Indian background. On the one hand there were the guys who were a dream to work with, hard working, capable, curious to learn and easy to get on with. Then there were the rest: Capable with huge egos and attitude. Or Semi-capable with huge egos and attitude, bristled at having errors pointed out Or Those who wouldn’t take directions from women or work with women, which was a problem in a team with women programmers Or The really genial guys who used their captivating personalities to charm their way out of doing any work at all – the rest of the team just loved these guys /s Lastly you had the quiet, retiring guys who weren’t sure how they got the job, and mostly would not have been able to find their way out of a wet paper bag. I realised later that the Indian body shops wrote a lot of the resumes to obscure lack of experience, education fudges and the like. So it doesnt surprise me at all that IT work outsourced to India could become a nightmare of redoing work and fixing problems when it was delivered back to the company. “Charlie Kirk Update and, As Predicted, Europe Snapbacks on Iran” ‘This means that snapback has now been officially ACTIVATED, and that UN sanctions against Iran will take effect at 8pm EST on September 27th. However, China and Russia issued a joint statement following the vote and officially announced that they consider the snapback of UN sanctions against Iran to be illegal and invalid, and that they will not abide by them. In other words, they will continue to do business with Iran as usual, regardless of UN sanctions. I suspect the other BRICS nations will adopt the same position.’ I find this a remarkable development. The European countries activated snapback sanctions without following the required legal steps first. So now Russia, China and other countries are just going to ignore those UN sanctions on the grounds of them being illegal and are not going to let Iran be isolated. I’m willing to bet that most countries know how it went down and so will privately at least take Iran’s side. In their hast to activate those UN sanctions, it is leading to a situation where they will no longer be so effective anymore. Re: How Climate Change Is Increasing Landslide Risk Worldwide I’ve been in Himachal Pradesh (N. India) the last month and seen loads of footage of huge landslides here, and in Ladakh. Big mountains + climate-change-roided cloudbursts = villages being wiped out, roads destroyed, transport impossible etc. Samples: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=d-iTz6QPdlU https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4JMghilYKNQ Yikes! May you have a strong roof overhead and solid ground beneath your bed. Either that or skipping from stone slab to stone slab in those raging waters like Eliza leaping from one floating cake of ice to another on the Ohio river in “Uncle Tom’s Cabin.” The sheer power of moving water is always to be respected. “Chinese readout of Xi-Trump phone call on Friday” ‘To realize this vision, both sides must move toward each other and make efforts to achieve mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation’ This sounds like Xi having a dig at how Trump works as all that listed is the opposite of how Trump works, especially the last bit. Trump only believes in deal where he comes out the winner and other countries lose i.e. zero-sum games. For Xi to come right out and talk about win-win scenarios sounds like XI saying that he is not going to play that game and that Trump will have to change accordingly. The world anxiously awaits the arrival of the first fourth comma Illionaire, how many gotten gains can one man accrue before taking a dirt nap? It’s tantamount to cheering on a glutton weighing in at 1,957 pounds, and only 43 more to a ton! Meanwhile, this was one of the article headers in the NYT today… Hamburger Helper Sales Rise as Americans Try to Stretch Their Food Dollars The price of beef and other grocery items is climbing, and consumers are turning to canned meats and a 1970s staple. Cousin Eddie and Hamburger Helper https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkExpbnjsX8 It’s so strange people striving to be the first trillionaire when it would make little difference in their lives if they could do it. We, except for an entry in the ‘Guinness Book of records” that is. Look at that 1985 film “Brewster’s Millions”- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCoGAZJQGmU (1:22 mins) And imagine challenging any person to spend a billion dollars in the space of, say, a year with nothing to show for it. Could it be even done? For these hundreds of billionaires, it sounds like that old game of ‘the person that dies with the most toys, wins.’ The 85 film is a remake of a 45 movie that might be a remake of a forgotten silent film. It’s an odd story. I don’t know if Richard Pryor was just hired for the remake or had an interest in the story. Older than that. It was originally a 1902 comedic novel and has been made into a film about a dozen times with the first one being made in 1914 by Cecil De Mille- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brewster's_Millions They should read about Dives and Lazarus. Its about the race to buy the most governments and politicians – a mere billion doesn’t go that far anymore! Quite. After the first $100 million it’s totally about the power. A movie that brings memories to the long gone VHS era. As far as billionaires go, you’ve missed the point. They don’t want money in order to spend money. They want more money, in order to have more money. Regular people can not understand mind of psychopat. Asking them why they need more money, is like asking serial killers why they need to kill more people. I can yet again attest to rising grocery prices here in the North American Deep South. I did the weekly shopping yesterday. As usual I ‘visited’ seven emporia in my perambulations. Live produce has hit a new and higher plateau. Cauliflower are now three dollars a head. Grapes are $2.95 a pound. Squash are also creeping up on three dollars a pound. The ‘standard’ smallish Industrial Grade avocados are running $1.25 each. (Industrial Grade because they are hard enough to build walls with. Organic bricks.) The choice of vegetables available has also shrunk. Items on other aisles have risen in price lately as well. That old Poverty Row staple, Top Cheap Ramen has risen to $.75 a packet. Mac and Cheese is now $1.25 a box. Chips, (not a staple, but a standard “comfort food,”) is up to around three dollars a bag, for the off brands. Many of the name brands are pushing five dollars a bag. Carbonated drinks are fizzing up again. Coca Cola brand is now ranging around $5.49 a six pack of .5 litre bottles. Two litre bottles of the same are retailing for $2.59 each. I have had to re-learn Mom’s habit of checking the coupons weekly and now perusing the weekly online sales at the various chain grocers. I still refuse to use phone apps. It is bad enough that I use a “Frequent Shopper” plan, really, surveillance program, at a chain store. As an example, I buy catfish fillets, locally sourced no less, from a big chain. I wait until they put it on “Buy One Get One” sale. Thus, I end up buying a couple of pounds of the little fishies for $5.49 a pound instead of the “normal” $10.99 a pound. I freeze the bulk of them individually in sandwich bags bathed in some distilled water with a squeeze of lemon. That assumes continued electricity service. When the grid goes down, or gets switched to favouring Surveillance State Data Centres, I might have to re-learn the joys of kippered herrings. (Mom fixed those regularly when we were young.) Anyway, that’s my story and I’m sticking to it. Stay safe. Thanks for the Store Provides Quality Ramen report, plebs can’t be pleased by the stagflation, did you happen to see any venison flavored instant noodles? No, the Imperium doesn’t have the Gaul to try providing that flavour ramen yet. Although, I would not be surprised to see, due to the cachet of the flavour ingreedient that this item would be deer indeed. ¢enturian, $tone $oup always works if you can lift some condiment sachets from the mini-mart petrol station. At my food co-op, organic olive oil (Spain, 33.8 fl oz) just went up another 20% after a previous 30% rise. There are other things as well. Maybe tariffs? It’s a tax, donchano. Crikey! I’ve mentioned it before, and we seem to get a celestial Kessler Effect on inflation, when foodstuffs go up it sets off the cost of a muffler repair, not to mention the cost of a perm going up too. I’ve only ever seen what I would call quite strident inflation, in Mexican markets in the 1980’s. I remember seeing cans of food with about 20 price stickers on top of one another, to better reflect the new replacement cost-which was always rising. My Mr. Cynic is screaming in my ear that having the price of food be a major percentage of the ‘average’ person’s income is the old-fashioned way of maintaining control over said persons. When your main interest is centred on where your next meal is coming from, things like the World and politics take a back seat. We seem to be entering yet again the world of “bread and circuses.” Be safe. Cynic is just a cheap attempt at being a soundalike palindrome, but you’re right. We all tend to buy the same foodstuffs over and over again, so everybody has a good idea of how inflation is hitting them. I always try and get Les @ the WinCo supermarket when I’m checking out, as he’s a glutton for punishment being a Raiders fan a few years older than me, and handy to blame inflation on (a running joke between us) as well. All those increases stupid CPI never notices, we pay through the nose. I understand that of late, the Raiders, a very appropriate name for an Oligarch Party mascot, have a joke of a running game. Yet the ticket prices keep going up. All those increases stupid CPI never notices, we pay through the nose. a timeless quotable So as to not be misunderstood with my first world woes (albeit woeful): Everyday, everyday, I have the blues, the Genocide Blues… To be countered by Team Blood Red. Ever get the feeling that on some days species extinction would be an acceptable option? Plus, I will propose that much of what claims to be the “Land of the Free and the Home of the Brave” is now a Second World polity. Be continuing safe. Food prices in Bulgaria and Europe have been going through the roof for some time now. It’s even more amazing that many foods cost more in Bulgaria now than the exact same thing in Germany, despite much lower incomes. Yet the political class is busy telling us not to believe our lying wallets. It’s nuts. I wonder what the sources of those foodstuffs are? Is Bulgaria capable of feeding itself today? Also, what about fertilizer inputs? Since the dislocations of the Russo-Ukraine War, I have read that fertilizer, a traditional export of both Russia and the Ukraine, has been in “short” supply in the West. I realize that the Jeffersonian Yeoman Farmer was a myth even back then, but Industrialized agriculture in America has passed its optimum concentration level. Very often, bigger is not better. Stay safe. Bulgaria is capable of feeding itself but it isn’t. EU and national policies encourage farmers to produce a lot of wheat for export, while local fruit, vegetable and livestock growers can’t compete with imports from elsewhere on the EU and from Turkey. Cartels are also bankrupting dairy farmers, buying milk for below cost and selling dairy products for an arm a leg (never mind that they also often contain milk powder, palm oil and lots of water). It’s rather grim to anticipate how the prices are bound to go up again when the Euro is introduced on January 1st. That seems nuts! Given Bulgaria’s climate zone (I think) you’d figure that Bulgaria should have very productive agriculture, esp in fruits and vegetables! That Turkey, of all countries (talking about climate, not history) should be exporting agricultural goods displacing the locals seems to confirm my hunch… What idiot agreed to introduce the Euro? This also sounds like the supposed “plot” by Stalin to ‘manage’ the agricultural economy of what is now the Ukraine back in the 1920s and 1930s. From what I have read, that plan was all about international flows. Just like today? Maybe the “opposition” politicians can arrange for some Russian Autarky Specialists to do a tour of Bulgaria. That should stir up the EU a bit. If worst comes to worst, is there still a Hapsburg family around to base the New Austrian Empire upon? Or does the Divine Porte want to reconstitute the old Ottoman Empire all the way to the gates of Vienna? Stay safe. One of my Austrian acquaintances likes to remind me that Rudolf von Habsburg was a Swiss, or rather, the original Habsburg castle (Rudolf’s) is in Switzerland. I think there are actually quite a few Habsburg descendants in European politics now, in different countries. Not sure where they fit in today’s Europe, though (they have generally been very pro European integration and the Habsburgs traditionally never have liked Russia or Orthodoxy much, ever.) The legend of William Tell tells you what the Swiss thought of the Habsburgs later I always thought the Habsburg experience in Switzerland, esp given all their later territorial expansion (esp under Charles V) hilariously funny. They were kicked out of their ancestral castle in 1415! (I just looked that up) Oddly, here they’re dumping soda as fast as they can, Pepsi brands in particular are frequently buy 2-3 and get 1 or 2 free. I’ve walked out with 5 for ~ $6.50/ea and they retail for about $10.50 now. They’ve been dumping them this way on and off this entire year. Jellies and jams are quite a price shocker lately, the brand I buy that’s got no HFCS in it is up to $8.50 now; I finally downgraded to another brand after buying it for 8 years. In Massachusetts, food prices are absolutely insane. It had gotten bad, then seemed to level out for a while but now it’s increasing out of control. It’s scary times. These prices sound wonderful, and cheap. I’m in BC Canada and cauliflower is around $6 a head, broccoli $4-5/ pound, butter, the cheap stuff, $8/pound, fishies, well, if they are less than $4/100 grams (about 3.5 ounces) they’re a steal. Gas remains at $1.90/litre so just under $8/gallon. You have no idea. Well you could diversify into roadkill but you need butchering skills. We buy 10 lbs. of ground chuck every 4 months or so. I was SHOCKED to find that the price was the same as it was 4 months ago. We use fully flattened roadkill to fashion frisbees out of. They are an export item in the local economy. Here, alas, road killed deer must be turned over to Wildlife and Fisheries for “disposal.” If you have to make a claim for deer related automobile damage, that Wildlife and Fisheries ticket is your passport to approved status on your claim. Here are the 2025 Ig Nobel Prize winners Improbable (Micael T) Trump’s press secretary stated that the President is very disappointed for not even getting one of these. In Geography? Is that near Cambodia? LOL, I just saw a video of him say Cambodia and Armenia (a bad war that was just starting). That’s a new one, and not to be confused with Aberbaijan and Albania. Next one will probably be Elbonia and Freedonia. Re, “A Japanese debt crisis is closer than you think”, is this a test for those of us who follow MMT? The article reminds me of the Monetarists who woke up after the Covid-induced inflation to claim, “see, we were right all along!” The BoJ has struggled to prevent deflation for decades, and now that they have allowed long term rates to “normalize” (the 10-year rate is almost 1.6%!), the author warns us to “beware of the bond vigilantes and a debt crisis!” Sure thing. Thing is, in Japan some of the super wealthy actually like Japan, so those debts just keep rolling over and those elites just keep collecting yen and interest income. No such luck over here. Interesting story about honeybees that suggests commercial bee colonies and the feral versions that result could be the kudzu of pollinators, overwhelming native solitary bees and thereby having a negative effect on native plants. Here in the South kudzu itself was of course an introduced Asian species and, despite gestures toward eradication, nothing seems to stop it. There is a local outfit that will provide you with goats (confined by temp electric fences) to eat it up. Meanwhile Big Ag seems dependent on the trucked in bees to service their megafarms–with honeybees themselves being threatened by disease and chemicals. Is the bee conflict yet another ecological threat in our ever more populated world? Physical this week. Brief conversation with my primary care physician and he wrote prescriptions for the COVID vaccine for me, my wife, and soon to be 89 y/o mother. My daughter, 40 y/o and grandsons 9 and 11 y/o (who also live in our home) will have to ask their primary. For her part she’s diabetic so we don’t expect resistance, and vaccination for the boys to protect my Mom (and us as well as we near 70). Point being, hopefully we won’t have to doctor shop to get their vaccine prescriptions (money cures most evils and I’ll fly them to another state if needs be). FWIW, we’re in FL so RFK Jr. isn’t the only nutter affecting things because added to his general level of insanity we have a nutcase Governor. Making it worse, his appointed Surgeon General is off the scale (or so in his boss’ pocket he acts the part). But it gets worse, apparently the vaccine schedule we grew up with as kids is out the window. Now parents, with government’s blessing, will be sending unvaccinated children to schools. No clue how long before this blows up with tragic results, but does it really take a scientists to grok this? I am sad for where we are headed. I understand Kennedy’s position of not wanting to force people, e.g. leave it to their civic responsibility to do the right thing but good grief, raise your hand if you think we’re raising a population imbued with civic responsibility . . . anybody? Me? I’m glad for Naked Capitalism. It’s been on the forefront of this information campaign. Not an overreaction to say, we’re maybe alive because of it as we’ve been NOVID during the entire pandemic due to vaccination, plus precautionary masking, yes, still never had COVID, now +5 years since this scourge began. I don’t miss Florida, having grown up there. Glad to hear you’ve still avoided COVID so far. May you never get it. Stay safe! I’m afraid the bonus antidote of the ducks and dog is AI generated. I go to NC to avoid this kind of thing! This is a bonus feature. FFS, and submitted by a reader. I don’t have time or the ability to verify vids. If you are going to bitch like this, I’ll omit bonus antidotes entirely. Please don’t cancel our bonuses. And I would not imagine NC is, as Sutter suggests, dogmatically anti-AI. I’m quite interested in what some artists have done with it. For example there’s a rather good film called Telepathic Letters made entirely using AI images telling the story of the correspondences between H. P. Lovecraft and Fernando Pessoa. There’s a trailer on YouTube but I don’t think it’s freely available yet. In the mean time, have you seen this spectacular AI Retro Rewind? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUFv59R6UFw (19:17) I can’t take my eyes off it. There’s a lot to critique in AI but like any tech the ethics arises in how it is used. I can think of worse uses than getting ducks in row. And while we’re at it, I want to see a video of the lion getting the blow out he’s walking home from in the main antidote. I second that. Please keep rolling out the bonuses. They help remind us of another world. Besides, I see them as a challenge. Lacking the technical skills to identify a fake, I rely on the instantaneous “ick” factor. So far, it’s worked pretty well. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley Sometimes they are fun. A few weeks ago I saw a ghimli Jimmy Page with a right hand on the strings and another right hand working the frets. Having techical skills, I can confirm that subconciousnes notices it first. Then the conscius part of the brain tries to explain what is wrong. For example legs of the lion looked off instantly. Then conscius part of of the brain adds info that quadrupedal animals move “diagonal” legs at the same time, and not those at the same side. At second look, the big cat seems to be a three legged beast. There was a bad AI pic of a pretty woman sitting at a table that I saw somewhere: apparently, AI decided that one of the table legs is a human leg, too, so the woman came out 3 legged. Personally, I like AI modded pics. They are fun inways that “real” pics are not. I support and love the antidotes, regular, bonus or (ai) discount. Let the full financial backer who needs no contributions and can pay Yves and staff fabulously extravagant salaries worry about antidote veracity. You lose points for not noticing that third one is AI too. ;-) I had wondered about the third, it seemed not plausible. It seems like AI for that one had lots of movies in its training set. In the first shot, the camera is not rotating but moving like it’s on a dolly. It is also very close while not distracting animals, and above the canyon, and not minding the snow. Animals acting like it’s a live action Disney movie, is just a bonus. :) Second shot looks much more realistic, and could have fooled me. See! We’re sharpening critical thinking skills with AI antidotes. Good thing too as I expect to need AI interpretive skills more and more. “EU floats plan to use frozen Russian assets for Ukraine loan, bypassing a Hungary veto” This whole elaborate Jenga Tower of a scheme rests on a simple premise. That this money will be paid back when Russia pays war reparations meaning when they lose. The Ukraine will never pay that money – ever. As soon as that money arrives in that country it will be spent at a rapid clip until it is all gone – poof! – and at that point Zelensky will demand yet more money. The countries that sign up for this ludicrous scheme will be on the hook for all that money and perhaps countries like Hungary may miss the worse aftershocks though no doubt the EU will demand that they chip in a coupla billion for the cause. The best scenario for the EU would be for the Ukraine to quit the war before this scam can be implemented but so long as the money flows, the war will go on. This whole elaborate Jenga Tower of a scheme rests on a simple premise, IBGYBG. Driving out to mother in law’s place in Cumberland county, pa recently, noticed that nobody in cumberland, Lancaster and adjoining counties seems to have planted soybeans this year. Perhaps they had anticipated the results of our clever Chinese trade war. Lotsa soybeans in NW Ohio. Either they didn’t get the memo, or they did get the memo that their man in Washington will be breaking out the checkbook again. I’m in NW Ohio. Centered between Toledo, Cleveland, and Columbus. If I were a soybean farmer I would be really worried about now. We haven’t had rain in almost 3 weeks, and probably longer of any rain that amounted to anything. The crops look bad when driving around the country. I haven’t talked to any farmers, but my buddy did last week. He said the beans look like a bee bee. Not good. Yeah. Trump 1.0 gave $23 billion to the farmers/middle men/exporters he screwed with the tariffs he put on costing AG hugely. https://www.forbes.com/sites/courtneyfingar/2024/09/27/trump-tariffs-failed-to-improve-us-trade-position-in-his-first-term/ “Forests Are Raining Plastic: New Study Reveals Shocking Pollution” Microplastics are as insidious as radiation was through all those nuclear tests last century meaning that all of us are still irradiated as a result of them. Here they are talking about forests being infested with this stuff but so are we as scientists have found microplastics in blood, the brain, the placenta, breast milk, and human bone marrow. Don’t ask me how it gets into our marrow but it does. As I said, this stuff is as insidious as fallout radiation- https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250918225014.htm The richest 10%– Yes, they’re responsible for half the consumption and half the carbon emissions that go along with that consumption. As I reported from perusing my Harvard 50th Anniversary Class Report, the preferred form of conspicuous consumption among that crowd is travel to exotic places, accounting for the fact that tourism is among the fastest growing sources of carbon emissions. Underlining just how blind these people are to what they’re doing was the entry where a Class of ’75-er bragged that his wife was head of the local Climate Action Now! group, and in the very next sentence boasted how often they flew to three different continents, including to India to their ashram. We’re changing the Earth for the worse from the human perspective so Boomer PMCs can bore their friends with their travel stories. Lao-Tzu seems to have anticipated the world of Viking cruises and pilgrimages to the summit of Everest: The farther you go, the less you know.

We’re encouraged to live up to our wealth, you don’t want to disappoint in living large by needing less, and sharing what has been a glorious experiment in Socialism, thanks to the establishment of our National Parks in 1872, I speak as a 1/329.999.999th co-owner with all of my countrymen. A few years ago I attended this discussion with Karen Armstrong, who was promoting her then-new book Sacred Nature, in which she called for a re-divinization of the environment in order to save it. Obviously I was (and am) interested in the topic, hence my attendance, but as I sat there I couldn’t help but ponder the silliness of listening to someone who’d flown from London to St. Paul, MN discuss the urgent need to save the planet. Did we have no authors closer to home? Well, perhaps none who would draw the type of crowd she did. But aside from her efficacy in mostly filling a theater in the Midwest, did her ideas have enough of an impact to make a difference? How does one know or measure that difference? Is making a difference necessary to justify her air travel, or anyone’s? I am certain Armstrong hasn’t had anything like the environmental impact of the average private plane-user, but I would guess her flying around doing good has had more of an impact than doing good in England would have (she mentions late in the talk of frequently visiting Pakistan, I am guessing as part of her work for the Charter of Compassion). How much impact is any one person allowed to have – more if they are doing important work, less if they are merely curious? The best way to travel is to learn another language. You go to another world, and you can do this without any added carbon emissions as you don’t have to leave home. It is work however. Fun for some :) If English is my another language, does posting here counts as a vacation? At the least it counts as a site seeing tour. Well done Indeed, what’s amazing to me is that, if Climate were taken seriously, literally the lowest hanging fruit is rich people stopping their international and private jet travel. Not banning single use plastic, lolz. While for most people it isn’t worth agonizing over personal carbon emissions, if I didn’t exist, Climate would still happen, rich people uniquely effect the world notably through their consumption patterns. And through their signaling. If living more austerely were suddenly that cool thing to do, as modeled by the elite, it likely would have ripple effects worldwide. But this timeline is stupid. “SITREP 9/19/25: “Russian Incursion” Scare Heats Up as Enfeebled NATO Hobbles to Respond” ‘An Estonian Foreign Affairs Committee chairman did however threaten to shoot down the next Russian jet, ‘cleverly’ invoking the infamous ‘17 seconds’ it took Turkey to shoot down a Russian Su-24 in 2015’ This guy is referring to the time when Erdogan thought it a brilliant idea to have his air force set up a well-planned ambush to shoot down a Russian fighter bomber on a mission is Syria. Erdogan – and Turkiye – paid a heavy price for that idiotic mistake but this Estonian guy is implying that maybe Estonia could also ambush and shoot down a Russian plane as well because what could possibly go wrong. Where do they find these people? And I doubt that it would be the Estonian Air Force trying to do this mission- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonian_Air_Force#Aircraft My attention went to the speech of a German General saying, according to embedded translation, that “I think we will have gradually to accept the new reality and this new reality means that Ukraine cannot win this war, at least not militarily.” New reality? Well let’s go with it. How can then Ukraine win the war in a non-military fashion? Win in the MSM? That’s easy and the Ukrainians have been “winning” the war in the MSM since the very beginning or even before. Winning to no avail. Ahhh! The sanctions, Russia is still in tatters or worse! Has been in tatters for more than 3 years but they stubbornly continue to fight, and win, the military war. Some may believe that at some point the Russians won’t be able to stand more hysterical barking by the chihuahuas. Perhaps supply the Ukraine w/ shovels and washing machines? The Russkies seem to be doing fine w/ those. He probably thinks that Germany did not lose WW1, at least not militarily, but were stabbed in the back. They never learn. re: EU – Ukraine War FOREIGN AFFAIRS from Sept. 10th alluding to a rather long war by way of outsourcing entirely to EU. Which has already begun as according to Andrei Martyanov e.g. military command has essentially been handed over from the US to the UK. German Anti-Spiegel had the FA text two daysa go There Thomas Röper sums up: “The transatlantic Council on Foreign Relations, which is highly influential in the US, published an article acknowledging the reality that Europeans alone, without the US, should assume security guarantees for Ukraine. On another point, the Council’s sense of reality has not yet prevailed, as its analysts are still demanding that Ukraine be fully integrated into Western structures. They are also still talking about sending European troops to Ukraine after a ceasefire, which means the war will continue for a very long time because Russia will not agree to it. This is bad news for Ukraine and its continued existence as a state.” Here the FA article A Better Way for Europe to Guarantee Ukraine’s Security How European Forces—and NATO Resources—Can Make the Country Stronger Ivo H. Daalder September 10, 2025 https://archive.is/swwgb Ivo Daadler lives in La-la-land. “Any agreement with Russia to end the war must preserve all three of these pillars (the formidable army of Ukraine, commitment of European deployment of substantial air, naval, and ground forces and a true security guarantee by integration of Ukraine in the EU and NATO)” There ain’t be any agreement of that kind with Russia. FA keeps fantasizing again and again. All of these three pillars exist only in Daadler’s imagination. In fact Daadler is in an indirect way saying: Europe, f¬c& you! Oh, all three can be achieved, just not the way people think. 1. There can be a “Group of Forces in Ukraine,” as part of the Russian Army. 2. I strongly suspect that a substantial European contingent has already been committed underground irretrievably in Ukraine. 3. EU and NATO can be reorganized by admitting Russia to both ans expelling US, Canada, and UK from the latter. (/S) I am tired of all the conspiracies around Tyler Robinson and his text messages. The kid has Asperger’s. How do I know? I have Asperger’s and my language is odd and overly formal at times as well. Since he is in his 20’s he most likely was having more psychiatric issues which is common because of the overlapping Asperger’s has with the positive symptoms of Schizophrenia. It is most likely he was having delusions no doubt fueled by internet use. Instead of using this instance as a call for more mental health care it is being twisted into some insane plot by grifters. This comment is an unwarranted attack on this post and the site generally. You are already in moderation and are asking to be blacklisted. There was all of ONE link on Charlie Kirk today (the others were on the Kimmel suspension) and it had NOTHING to do with his texts. And if you are trying to censor other commenters, you have no business doing so. You are no better than anyone else here and are out of line in trying to shut down discussion. I was commenting on the Internet in general. It not against any post here or this website in general. Sorry about the confusion, but as I said, I have Asperger’s and a lot of times my writing does not come across as clearly as I would like. I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt that “the conspiracies” you refer to are in general, and not specific to anything originating on this site. I have seen no evidence that the commenters around here are pushing conspiracy theories. These events (mass shootings, assassinations) always seem to inspire conspiracists. In this instance, both sides (left/right) seek to weaponize the event to score political points. If you are on the right, the fact that the shooter allegedly had a trans BF suddenly elevates this from a lone wolf shooting to a vast conspiracy with every purple-haired LGBTQ activist potentially a co-conspirator and threat to humanity. Throw in the buzzword “Antifa” and there you go. Likewise, the left wanted to initially paint Robinson as a right-wing gun nut, given his family history of conservative parents and gun usage. I find both despicable. What I find interesting is how the kid could be so naive as to confess to the crime via text message. For all the stereotypes of youth being super-savvy with tech, why not at least use Snapchat or some secure messaging platform (security being a relative term) like Signal? And why didn’t the romantic interest stop Robinson before he not only confessed, but gave the prosecution evidence of motive? I’d be like “whoa there, hoss, slow down, let’s not get ahead of ourselves, how about dem Yankees?” That at least raises my spidey-sense a bit. I guess there is an innocent explanation – people in general don’t understand how to protect their rights, and even the young can be shockingly naive about how easy it is for law enforcement to get access to their text and phone records. It doesn’t even take a subpoena, especially if they get a hold of the suspect’s phone and can get into it. I wonder if this is how they got the texts? Or did they have to go to the telcos? It might help tamp down on some of the conspiracy theories if the cops released this information. As for your theory on the suspect’s mental health, it is an interesting possibility. I have no particular expertise to add anything other than if I were the kids lawyer, I’d be looking into this as a possible defense, because otherwise, he looks to be cooked. BTW his request would include censoring Max Blumenthal, who has pointed out re the texts: 1. The ones in the charging document dctment have no time stamps. 2. No joke, they are RECONSTRUCTED. That is the FBI’s word. So suspicion is NOT CT and is fully warranted. See this interview starting at 7:55 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3j50GbcT2k “The kid has Asperger’s” Since we’re making blanket requests can I ask that we stop referring to adults as children? I’m tired of the infantilization of adults. I refer to anyone under 30 as “kid.” It is part of the terrain of approaching 60. Now, get off my lawn! Pulls out Stanley tape. I am clearly 1/2 inch onto the public easement! signed, 66 year old grumpy neighbor I noticed the following story on America becoming a post-literate society and the imminent end of civilization as this trend continues and spreads worldwide: The Dawn of the Post-Literate Society. The author blames it all on smart phones. By coincidence I am now reading Empire of Illusion by Chris Hedges, which makes the same case for America becoming post-literate, but barely mentions smart phones—because it was published in 2009, when they were still just starting to come on strong. Hedges blames cable TV and the internet. And both books quote Neil Postman’s Amusing Ourselves to Death, which was making many of the same arguments in 1985. The overall argument is correct, but what needs to be added is that each new technological and regulatory “advance” accelerates the damage done by previous ones. Really you can start with movies and radio in the very early 20th century as the first few pebbles in the avalanche, and television in the very late 1940s was the big boulder that cascaded the decline in literacy much more dramatically, pushing us toward a culture of visual imagery and Ong’s “secondary orality” (it’s amusing to compare TV programming and advertisements from the 1950s with anything from decades later to see how primitive and tentative the early content was, as opposed to the manipulative sophistication of later offerings). Hedges also compares literacy level required to be able to follow Presidential debate arguments, finding JFK vs. Nixon in 1960 to be two full grades lower than Lincoln-Douglas, with the Obama-Trump-Biden era dumbed down almost three full grades more—down to a 7th grade level, consistent with almost half on American adults only able to read at a 6th grade level now. Aurelien likes to blame the stupidity of our leaders and the nihilism and dumbing down of society on the New Left, postmoderns, hippies, and other Baby Boomer demons, but the cause was plainly the media environment they were enveloped in from birth, an environment which got more than just additively worse for succeeding generations each time we went to a new technology (and the associated regulatory framework for it), so, from broadcast television to cable television, from personal computers to internet connected computers to smart phones and tablets, from movies in theaters to VHS to DVD to streaming, etc. And at each step the content delivered by these media (like much social media now) has become, while technically even more glossy and sophisticated, morally and culturally more crude, more violent, more degrading, and more appealing to our worst impulses. We Boomers are children of the tube, and for all the teeth gnashing about the internet far too little is made of how television changed America. For example one reason the rich were able to take over politics was because campaigns began to center around expensive television advertising. Attack commercials became a staple of weak candidates like George W. Bush and his SC hitman Lee Atwater (met him once). Journalism too began to be more about “news personalities” rather than faceless newspaper scribes. People like Dan Rather–currently complaining about Repub threats–became millionaire celebrities with a different perspective than the old shoe leather up from the police beat crew. One doesn’t want to over simplify given all the other post WW2 changes, but here’s suggesting the sources you quote are still dead on target. As if the founding fathers were poor people? The Robber Barons never existed? The rich have always owned the levers of politics and were onlyy temporarily throttled back by the New Deal. But I never claimed that our country was once run by the poor or that pre television politics were simon pure. What I am saying is that the increasing cost of campaigns, their reliance on television and image, certain Supreme Court rulings have accelerated the class war to the point where the working class seems to have no voice at all other than the fake populism of televsion hero Trump who used his celebrity rather than his riches to win. The high cost also feeds into the Congressional incumbency racket where Congress people spend a huge amount of time sucking up to donors to pay for their campaigns. It’s a much bigger pay for play. Manifestly ignorant societies with nuclear weapons; What could go wrong? To say nothing of Public Health. Can a complex civilization built by a highly literate population be maintained when it’s inherited by a barely literate population of visual image addicts who can only the describe the world in the exaggerated “good guy”-“bad guy” stereotypes of oral heroic fantasy sagas? That’s really the question. How long can America’s Eloi keep nuclear reactors, data centers, ICBM silos, hospitals, universities, interstate highways, railroads, and wastewater treatment plants repaired and running before they have to import the Russian or Chinese Morlocks to handle all that complexity for them? It’s not only that the rich are running the system with a tighter stranglehold than before, but they’re running it into the ground with their incompetence, stupidity and hubris, all the while living in a mental dreamworld where they are fabulously brilliant, meritocratic geniuses.

They are bullying everyone: Candace Owens’s comments were insightful, as they are also an indictment of the Trump / US foreign policy (and Israeli FP) and even Trump himself, though she is referencing Bill Ackerman. And that would place her “left” of the official US political “left.” If you has asked me five years ago who would be the biggest public critics of the Zionist entity, Candace Owens and Tucker Carlson would not have been anywhere near the top of my list. Yet here we are, with those other public figures who definitely know better largely silent. i might not be a regular to either (i tried to listen to Owens´s piece on Madame Macron but that as far as i came did not strike me as worth my time; perhaps wrongly so?) but on the general level – indeed, fantastic actually. And terrifyingly so on the other hand, 5 years ago I was living on the other side of the moon…it feels like a lifetime ago. My view is that “dissidents,” practically by definition, are a little nuts and are given to occasional wild and crazy musings. But, when the whole world is going crazy, it takes crazy but honest people to see and tell the truth. not wrong suggestion at all ;-) Facts, bro. Count me as one of em! Gotta do crazy shit to test the limits of our Society and find the Golden Mean 😊 You can add in Marjorie Taylor Greene as well. Crazy times. re: history of military affairs “Operational History (German) Section” – Nazis/US/RU I ran across the Operational History (German) Section which was operated by the US ARMY between 1946 and 1961. It tasked over 300 German officers and generals to deliver a military history of WWII. From THEIR POV. I haven´t looked it up yet but I assume this is closely related to Andrei Martyanov´s suggestions about US (post) Cold War views on Russia. Views that would shape the training and tactics of US and NATO forces against Russia not just 40 years ago but today too, alongside the experience of the War On Terror. Which is why I personally see it as a rather important finding. (Not to those of course who have already studied this issue closely.) I suggest everyone read it. The Wiki Page can be easily translated as there is NO Engl. version (which is more than interesting). https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_History_(German)_Section#cite_note-29 https://de-m-wikipedia-org.translate.goog/?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=de&_x_tr_pto=wapp&_x_tr_hist=true#cite_note-29 I ran across it studying German newspapers and the Propaganda Ministry´s SOP during WWII. Several of those men were integrated into “Operational History (German) Section”. It was headed by Franz Halder. Halder was: “(…) Chief of staff of the Army High Command in Nazi Germany from 1938 until September 1942 (…) directed the planning and implementation of Operation Barbarossa (…) became instrumental in the radicalisation of warfare on the Eastern Front. He had his staff draft both the Commissar Order (issued on 6 June 1941) and the Barbarossa decree (signed on 13 May 1941) that allowed German soldiers to execute Soviet citizens for any reason without fear of later prosecution, leading to numerous war crimes and atrocities during the campaign. After the war, he had a decisive role in the development of the myth of the clean Wehrmacht. (…)”. On his and the Section´s function: “(…) As early as 1946, the former Chief of the Army General Staff, Franz Halder, justified his leading role in the Operational History Program by stating that he was contributing to “continuing the fight against Bolshevism.”[21] In 1949, Halder saw his task as Topic Leader as being, in cooperation with the Control Group, “to contribute beyond the establishment of individual facts to clarifying the internal connections of major military issues.”[22] (…)” The intent and role of the studies made should not be a critical analysis. Instead: “(…) No experiences are to be recorded, no leadership secrets are to be explained or even revealed, but rather (in the style of the Reich Archives on the First World War) facts, the course of the fighting and the events on the German side are to be described. […] The German actions are to be seen and recorded from the German point of view, and thus a memorial is to be erected to our troops. […] The achievements of our troops are to be duly appreciated and highlighted. Of course, the truth must not be disregarded in this way. (…)”[7] And this only the mundane Wiki. I the 1970’s to 1990’s people like John Erickson and later David Glantz did an enormous job to bring to Soviet experience of WW2 to the west and prove beyond any doubt that – most WW2 German military documents being archived in Moscow – the German generals basically wrote apologies, not military history. When they won it was due to their brilliance (and not having superior numbers or overwhelming air support), when they lost it was Hitler micromanaging or the Soviet hordes just overrunning them. And none of them was ever involved in the deaths of the 14 million Soviet civilians in any way or form – it just kinda happened. When Erickson died, he was in the middle of writing a new book proving that in 1945 the Red Army was better and more efficient fighting force than Wehrmacht ever had been and that the chances of survival for an individual soldier in the Red Army were better than in any other army in WW2. Sadly, it was never finished. Much appreciated! I have learned of Glantz by now regularly looking up Martyanov´s military scholarship. Erickson´s work I will look into too now. Any reading suggestions? p.s. I have muttered for a long time critique over the fact that we as a continent do not speak Russian and therefore have missed out on 100+ years of knowledge and cultural production (just the USSR angle now) which most likely will never be compensated for. Similar with the total exclusion of GDR expertise by the “victorious” FRG in so many disciplines ranging from art, literature to diplomacy to economics and climate research. Generations of knowledge wiped out. Actually, German theatre companies have just started to revive DDR operettas (Messeschlager Gisela in Cottbus, In Frisco ist der Teufel los in Berlin). I don’t know how this extends to other arts, I would assume an exception to the rule for a certain target audience. I was referring to the big context of unification and the eclipsing of almost the entire intellectual production of the GDR beyond some writers, painters, directors, scholars who mostly were already known in the FRG before 1989. Especially as latter are concerned it appears as if we are stuck with the clichés of evil Communist dictatorship. It will all fade eventually but only as part of everything else into oblivion. So GDR will remain mostly a forgotten realm of – whatever. Unless you are someone specialized. But that won´t concern 99% of the population. Case in point were short-lived discussions 25 years ago about the mistake of dismantling of the big GDR film production and the huge Babelsberg film studios. 3000 craftsmen were mostly fired or simply let go, the body of a highly-skilled workforce. One could have integrated them instead, maybe unite that studio with other Western locations – if one had had any vision of a e.g. pan-German film industry (together with Austria and Switzerland). But if addressed this (utopian way) even knowing people were just laughing. Instead East Germany lost most of its cinemas. Out of 1500 cinemas pre-1989, around 200 survived. And by comparison to other areas with film folks the “integration” or further development would have been easy. The overwhelming majority of entertainment/journalism which was considerable was mostly out of work over night. And often craftswise they were better than those in the West, e.g. singers, dancers, musicians, show hosts, critics. A very sad story, catastrophic by certain standards. Never happened… …to my surprise a lot of Erickson in the library of my choice by comparison The influence is gigantic, especially evident in the writings by and of US military historians, including many serving military officers through 1960s at least. It took people who saw real combat to rethink the conventional wisdom abd that still was not easy (I note that Col Glantz was an artilleryman in VN who had much exp trading fire with PAVN gunners and their Soviet pieces who’d have appreciated the latter’s methods before becoming a full time historian) For those as uninformed as myself this decent Wiki on Erickson (obviously from a pre-MI6-ed Wiki) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Erickson_(historian) found this, via a Feeny thing on Unherd: https://www.theargumentmag.com/p/youre-being-rude-put-away-your-phone i am impressed enough that i sent it to my youngest, up there at Texas Tech, who is most definitely addicted to his fondleslab. Gotta say, in a world bent on getting Hot Hot Hot, I had the most pleasant summer in my 20 years of living in Tiny Town from a temperature standpoint. Maybe we eked out a dozen days of 100 or more. It was as if our environment wasn’t even trying, lots of days in the lower 90’s and utterly pleasant. Interesting. In complete contrast, the summer or ’25 was the worst summer I’ve experienced in my life. 8 weeks with no rain. Temperatures (humidex adjusted) in the high 40s, wildfire smoke. Unpleasant and anxiety raising. I am wearing out my night guard from grinding my teeth in my sleep. We have had some rain but not enough. I am very worried about local farmers. This is not good. Wuk, How do you keep cool with no electricity when it is over 100? …that’s why they invented air conditioning Shockwave as Houthi drone hits hotel; Qatar attack triggers new Mideast alliance – Janta Ka Reporter, YouTube After clicking on this link, I noticed another video in the sidebar: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW7L6ALWK80 Egypt & Turkey TEAM UP – The END of ISRAEL? (Note: First time I saw this channel, so I’m not familiar with the background of the speakers. I’m only posting for the subject matter discussed on this day.) While they point out that it’s a tricky situation, this and the other videos intensifies a point: The countries in the Mid-East must get past divisions and work on unity among themselves as a first step to regional security. They may then choose other big countries outside for alliances, but their unity would be the first step toward real security – or other big powers will continue to use the divisions to their own advantage. Some may do it with less blood spilled, but they are all prone to use the advantage. There is still much left to unpack with the volatile situations faced by Lebanon and Iran. 17 years ago, Gaddafi lamenting the state of Arab relations. Gaddafi Speech at Arab League Meeting, March 2008 – We all distrust each other https://youtu.be/fMLmA4lnxXo Well, maybe the people who are actually involved don’t share our notions of who they should unite with. It reminds me of the the time the Arabs invaded France in what allegedly was a death struggle between Christianity and Islam. In fact Christians and Muslims all over the place were happily making deals with each other to fight other Christians and Muslims. They might not have liked each other but they really didn’t like Charles Martel. They are making their own decisions about those using divisions for advantage. I don’t claim credit for giving them “the notion”. 🤡 https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15115581/Putin-Russia-sends-sick-troops-HIV-illnesses-frontline.html Putin’s contagious Kamikazes: Russia sends sick troops with HIV and other illnesses into ‘meat grinder’ assaults amid health crisis ravaging his forces Russia is sending soldiers infected with HIV, hepatitis and other contagious diseases to the frontline as part of a desperate strategy to ‘ultimately prevail’, military analysts have warned. Soldiers sporting red armbands to denote their medical conditions have been spotted around Pokrovsk, a town in eastern Ukraine and key stronghold that has recently come under intense assault by President Vladimir Putin’s forces. Experts believe the sighting of such armbands is proof of the worsening health of Putin’s troops, with the number of HIV, hepatitis and tuberculosis cases said to be soaring, The Telegraph reported. Marvel Studios might wanna turn to the Daily Mail in search of new screenwriters Daily Mail took the story from The Telegraph, which took it from “Dmytro Zhmailo, executive director of the Ukrainian Security and Cooperation Centre (USCC), a Ukrainian think tank with close links to the military”. So, from the same people that gave us blockbusters like Ghost of Kiev, Snake Island Defenders, and Shovels of Bakhmut. LOL #Frealz Great story. What disease were all the Ukrainians with the yellow armbands suffering? This is a level of idiocy I did not think even a supermarket tabloid could reach. Tomorrow Sasquatch comes to Ukraine’s aid. What disease were all the Ukrainians with the yellow armbands suffering? Jaundice? Those red armbands probably indicate TDS. “These are better Americans than the average American. That’s my clientele.” – Ken Cuccinelli said in 2014 when he launched Virginia Self Defense Law. (From the Self Defense Insurance article) Good to know our Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security believes there are select Americans that are better than the rest of us merely by purchasing his product. From GWB’s “with us or with the terrorists” to Palin’s “Real America” the notion of “What kind of American are you?” (A line in the recent movie “Civil War”) is becoming more and more weaponized and even commodified here by The Cooch. That said, I’m actually sort of in favor of the idea gun owners should be required to have insurance but more along the lines of auto insurance. Sure, you can have your gun but if you’re a 16-25 y/o male your insurance rates are gonna be sky high. found another that will compel me to wander about the environs and ponder: https://romanticon.substack.com/p/open-country A good argument, but it seems to forget the heffalump in the room, necessary population decline. As agricultural economies of scale decline, the remaining means of production manage to be able to support fewer and fewer people. This is referred to around here as The Jackpot. Insofar as this happens, those losing out in the resource competition must resort to more and more violent methods to keep alive. This is my concept of the neo-feudalism mentioned as a possibility in the essay. One major ‘service’ the Neo-feudal “Lord” offers is protection of oneself and family from the depredations of competing Robber Barons. Under this Aegis, the suggested Romantic producer cooperatives can function. A strict division of functions is established. The division of the produced resources is a matter for internal political bargaining. Stay safe. I just stumbled on the High Priest Wurlitzer of British Establishment, Andrew Marr, blaspheming with another blasphemist, on Blightys servile status towards the Hegemon, the status that is ongoing and being enhanced by our U.K. government, in the colorectal direction. Old Andy is being less than respectful to all the TechBros, the horror! https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rKYHfJLbHe4 I think it informative. There is no way in hell that any of our MSM superstars would have spoken like this about the Master and his forward troops, even a year ago. Ken Klippenstein White House Eyes Transgender “Terrorist Movement” Leaked intelligence doc warns of “trans militant cult” Oh brother, these people are delusional. I know (of) several trans people, they’re just trying to live their own lives. Militarism is not on their list. From the New Market Wizards by Schwager in the early 1990s. We got our answer. In the coin toss example you just provided, computer simulations make it possible to generate huge data samples that allow you to con-dude that the mean has no limit. But how can you definitively state that the variances of commodity price distributions are not finite? Isn’t the available data far too limited to draw such a conclusion? There are statistical problems in determining whether the variance of price change is infinite. In some ways, these difficulties are similar to the problems in ascertaining whether we’re experiencing global warming. There are suggestive indications that we are, but it is difficult to distinguish the recent rise in temperature from random variation. Getting enough data to assure that price change variance is infinite could take a century. The problem for me about all this is its application to humans in a variable environment – spanning all time and space in our history. How did DSGE models/VaR work out, generational environmental bias factored in as high powered psychology is applied via endless PR/Marketing = traditions evolve in the blink of an eye … Climate is a completely different observation which is sadly framed in the simplistic notion of temp. How many of the general population have the perception gained by understanding its not just a couple of degrees increase in C/F from the past. Its how much energy is present in the atmosphere/geology/oceans globally and how that effects everything e.g. more energy means more extremes and pace of change. Its going to be an interesting summer here in OZ. That quote does not seem to be well informed. The towering mathematical talent Beniot Mandelbrot looked at the distribution of market prices, staring with commodities data for over 100 years. He found that they were random but not Gaussian (as an a normal distribution) but were Levy stable distributions with alphas of less than 2 (Gaussian distributions have an alpha of 2, which makes them tractible). They do have infinite variances: A probability distribution, with parameters α, β, c, and m (the mode). The parameter β (-1≤β≤1) determines the skewness, with β=0 corresponding to a distribution symmetric about m. The spread of the distribution depends on the value of c. The shape of the distribution depends on α (0 < α ≤ 2), with α = 2 corresponding to the normal distribution. The case α = 1 and β=0 corresponds to the Cauchy distribution. In general, the distribution has an infinite variance. The epithet ‘stable’ is a consequence of the property that (with m=0) any linear combination of random variables having this distribution will also have the distribution (with the same values for α, β, and c). Although the characteristic function for a general Lévy stable distribution is known, there is no general formula for the corresponding probability density function. https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100102659 Mandelbrot did his work in the early 1960s. I assume the special case of the Gaussian distribution does not have infinite variance, otherwise modelers would not use it as a bad proxy for market behavior. ‘Arnaud Bertrand @RnaudBertrand Absolutely extraordinary exchange between Israel and China ?? I’ve never seen such a heated exchange come out of top-level forum in China (this is from the 12th Beijing Xiangshan Forum that started yesterday), this normally never happens. The guy speaking is Yan Xuetong, the dean of the Institute of International Relations at Tsinghua University, the most prestigious university in China. Speaking for Israel is a military officer apparently called Elad Shoshan.’ You can tell that that IDF guy is frustrated. If that Dean had been from any western country, then he would lose his job, be canceled and face charges of antisemitism before the end of the day. But this Dean, being from a prestigious Chinese institute, can call the IDF guy out on his bs and he cannot do anything about it. Not even Trump can sanction this guy. It really is a side show …. So the IDF guy is using the terrorist label, applied with a broad brush, too a whole indigenous ethic group, post Israel breaking every agreement/treaty since Balfour, funded Hamas via Qatar to oust the PLA, and set them up so it would vindicate liquidating the entire population so they could take it over …. without blinking an eye … Thanks for quoting my comment on the H-1B situation. Regarding the ‘annual’ thing that found its way into some of the reports, this was apparently based on statements from [Sec. of Commerce] Howard Lutnick, who said the intention was for the $100,000 fee to apply annually but ‘the details are still being worked out’. There is nothing about that in the order itself, as you can see, and I’m not sure how that would even work (H-1Bs apply for three years, and once you have one I don’t see how you shake them down for another $100k the following year absent a law change). So if the media is reporting it badly that’s partly because there’s considerable ambiguity and confusion at the source (this seems to be a feature and not a bug for Trump, as usual). Here’s an updated example: Lutnick also repeatedly said on Friday that the fee would be annual for companies, while the White House official said Saturday that it’s a “one-time fee that applies only to the petition.” In her Saturday afternoon post, Leavitt clarified that the payment would only be a “one-time fee” — not an annual one. The order supports the latter read, but it’ll come down to what replaces it in 12 months, if anything. A fascinating interview by Nima at Dialogue Works. Max Blumenthal: Charlie Kirk’s Story FALLS APART Awkward questions being raised. watching thank you Blumenthal’s first statement, 8 minutes in, resolves to the profound. blum through the red pill It’ll be very interesting to see if Kirk’s widow and new Turning Point leader is pro-Israel or closer to Kirk’s late life views. If the latter, how long she lasts. I don’t keep up on the personal lives of the punditry so unsure if she has demonstrated any prior political savviness, but pretty reliably the first line of defense on free thinking for someone public like this is the all expenses paid trip to Israel with an escorted trip to Jerusalem to ‘see the reality’*. So keep an eye out for that (or not) because Netanyahu will absolutely not miss the opportunity to parade her in front of the cameras to bolster his current ‘it wasn’t me’ claims. *: I have been subjected to a lower-profile version of this – I’m not a public figure so I didn’t get the press complement of course – there is an official tour guide trained to explain to you, the outsider, why things are the way they are there and every explanation they have comes back to ‘them against us’. My guide spent a lot of time ranting about the perfidy of Qatar after he had warmed up a bit, and this was the first time I was exposed to the ‘Qatar is behind everything’ meme over there. I was also being escorted by a Kahanist so it was like, double-barreled insanity. It is difficult to withstand this stuff unless you are already kind of used to navigating lies and bs with diplomacy (I am, it is part of my job) and practiced in critical thinking. So I don’t have high hopes for Kirk’s widow, I expect her to take the money and shut up. I’m cynical enough to think that if she might not be compliant she would not have been allowed to take the job. 2 min. clip from THE INDEPENDENT´s conversation series. I have never seen this.

This is simply sick in such a profound way. No wonder Hitler had hoped to coalesce with GB. This is the sediment of Nazism as a form of imperialism. And it has to go. No question about it. And since it has been cultivated for 500 years it´s not gonna be easy and it´s not gonna be quick. And certainly not going away without resistance. Sometimes it´s curing to see such instances of megalomania, incompetence and suprematism cast in dialect, gestures, language, tonality. Politeness and a matter-of-factness which are mind-blowing. If the other side deems you not worthy there is nothing but force to make clear to them this far and no further. Otherwise they will never stop and never yield. Sigh.

Title: Rob Arnott revolutionized stock investing. Decades later, he's still disrupting the market's favorite strategies.

Time Published: 2025-09-20T09:45:01Z
Full Content:
Rob Arnott had just finished his burger when we ended up on perhaps the most interesting detail of an hourlong interview: He has seen 18 solar eclipses. That's quite the résumé, considering they only happen once every year and a half. He's traveled to see them in Antarctica and Australia. He's seen one from a plane off the coast of Iceland; another he saw in Bhutan, and one while on a boat in the Black Sea. "It's the most amazing sight the sky has to offer," Arnott, the founder of Research Affiliates, told Business Insider over lunch last week. "It's emotional, and it's hard to put your finger on why. On one level, you feel very small. Just a little speck in the universe. And on the other hand, you're very moved by the sheer beauty of it." Initially, Arnott's passion for the celestial phenomenon surprised me. Then I connected the dots. Earlier in our conversation, Arnott had briefly mentioned that his passion for math in high school had him split between a career in finance or astrophysics. Ultimately, of course, he chose the former. "I was good at math, but not extraordinary," he said. "To make a difference in astrophysics, you have to be extraordinary." What kind of career astrophysicist Rob Arnott would have had, we'll never know. But in the world of investing, we can be certain that Arnott has made his mark. Arnott has been a pioneer in index investing products, pointing out flaws in popular mainstream indexes like the S&P 500 that can hurt investors. Since these indexes are passive, cap-weighted strategies, they can have an investor unwittingly overweight one sector or theme, like technology or AI. In the early 2000s, Arnott was the first to introduce alternative index strategies to the market, launching his Fundamental Index in 2005. Firms like BlackRock, Charles Schwab, Invesco, and PIMCO have funds that use Research Affiliates' indexes. Today, Arnott is still launching new products that challenge market dynamics. His most recent focus is on the stocks that get kicked out of or added to the S&P 500 and other indexes. Last year, he put out the Research Affiliates Deletions ETF (NIXT), which is a collection of fundamentally attractive stocks that have been taken out of the S&P 500. Last week, he released the Research Affiliates Cap-Weighted US ETF (RAUS), which takes a cap-weighted approach to indexing only after undergoing a fundamentals-based selection process. Arnott sees it as an improvement on the inefficiencies of the current selection and removal process for major indexes, which can diminish returns. "One thing that I keep learning again and again and again is the resistance to change in the indexing world," he told BI. "These are ideas that should have been advanced decades ago. And why weren't they? Very simple: We're trained to think about the world from a cap-weight centric perspective, not from a company perspective, a business perspective." Arnott's lunch place of choice was the dining room at Gramercy Tavern in Manhattan. He ordered an iced tea along with his burger. Though Arnott hasn't lived in New York full time since 1988, he said he's been frequenting Gramercy Tavern during his regular visits to the city since it's been around. "It's iconic, it's comfort food, it's been here forever, it's got a comfortable ambiance," Arnott said of the place. "If I have business in this part of town, Gramercy Tavern's a natural go-to." Arnott, who is based in Miami, did indeed have business in lower Manhattan that day, bouncing around town to promote his new RAUS ETF. The product seeks to correct a substantial defect in popular passive index strategies, which seem to disregard the investing maxim that past performance isn't indicative of future results. Indexes often add stocks after they've seen huge outperformance, which grows their market cap enough to be considered. However, Arnott's research finds that those returns are usually not sustained. Conversely, indexes tend to kick out stocks that have suffered poor performance, which drives down their market cap. When passive investors are forced to dump those stocks, they become even more cheaply valued. Arnott's findings show that big returns usually follow. He cited the example of Dillard's Department Store, a mid-cap stock that has been taken out of and added back to the Russell 1000 index multiple times. "In the last quarter century, it has been removed from the index and added back to the index four times. So buy low, high, low, four times, and every time you're doing enormous damage to your wealth if it's the only stock you're trading." "How big a difference does it make? It's been a member of the Russell 1000 in 22 of the last 35 years. During those 22 years, it has underperformed the Russell index by 99%," he continued. "In the 13 years that it wasn't a member, it gave you 67 times the wealth of the Russell 1000." RAUS considers four factors, Arnott said: adjusted sales, adjusted cash flow, dividends plus buybacks, and book value plus intangibles. As it works out, the fund has about a 95% overlap with the S&P 500. About 5% of companies in the benchmark index don't make the cut for RAUS, as their valuation levels or other fundamental factors weaken their investment case. Palantir, CrowdStrike, and DoorDash, for example, are not in RAUS. To fill in the rest of that 5%, Arnott applies 3% of it as an extra overweight for the top 95% of holdings. The remaining 2% are about 100 attractive small-cap stocks. This framework has beaten the S&P 500 by an average of 0.69% annually since the early 1990s, Arnott said. "It's an incredibly simple idea," he said. "We're trained to think the market is pretty efficient, big market cap means big successful future for the business, and often that's true. And often it's not." Arnott may not have gone into astrophysics all those years ago, but his inclination toward science still seems to influence his approach to investing. "I think it's great fun to just ask questions," he said. "The essence of science is disagreement, and that shows up in the investing world too. Why on earth would we be the first to challenge the notion of choosing stocks for a cap-weighted index by something other than market cap?" Arnott's consensus-busting ideas usually pinpoint abnormalities in the market — out-of-whack probabilities that make for attractive risk-reward ratios. His value- and fundamental-oriented strategies aren't quite as flashy or volatile as growth areas of the market, and don't play out overnight, but the results materialize over time. Toward the end of our lunch, Arnott pulled out his phone and showed me impressive, bright-orange photos snapped while chasing eclipses. For the most recent one he saw, on a ranch in Austin, Texas, in April 2024, there was cloud cover. So instead of trying to snap pictures, he decided to record a time-lapse. In the video, people bop around in a field, eventually stopping to look up through the overcast to marvel at the darkening sky. All the while, Arnott, having everything in place well before the moment of totality, stood behind the camera and took in the excitement. "I just set a camera up," he said, "and let it do its thing."

The personality traits associated with collectors of art and antiques have been explored recently in various periodicals, including the Journal of Antiques and Collectibles. In an article for that specialist publication, US author and collector of Chinese porcelain Shirley M Mueller suggests the personal characteristics most associated with collectors include openness to experience and conscientiousness. She links “openness to experience” to those collectors who also have a broad range of interests, a curiosity and a deep appreciation for aesthetics. Musing on the psychology of the collector makes one wonder who might purchase an Edwardian silver tea service originally gifted to Sir Ernest Shackleton, the Co Kildare-born Antarctic explorer. The three-piece set, comprising a teapot, sugar bowl and milk jug, is for sale at Roseberys’ silver auction in London on September 30th, with an estimate of £2,000-£3,000 (€2,310-€3,470). Georgina Agnew, head of silver at Roseberrys, explains that the tea set was reputedly presented to Shackleton in New York in 1910 during his North American lecture tour. “It is engraved with the Shackleton family crest and motto ‘fortitudine vincimus’ meaning through endurance, we conquer,” she explains. The James Dixon & Sons of Sheffield tea set was passed to Ernest and Emily Shackleton’s daughter Cecily, before being given to her cousin and close friend, Rena Dodds. Dodds subsequently gifted the tea service to the current vendor’s mother. From 2001 until earlier this year, the tea set was on long-term loan to the Scott Polar Research Institute in Cambridge. But, who will buy it now? [ Listen: Ernest Shackleton’s adventure is told in his own voice - thanks to AIOpens in new window ] “As with all historically significant objects, we alert relevant museums, institutions and individuals ahead of the auction. Ernest Shackleton’s story is a global phenomenon, and while it could find a home anywhere in the world, it would be wonderful if an Irish institution were to acquire this important piece of history, given his Irish heritage,” Agnew says. Efforts by this columnist to contact the Shackleton Experience Museum in Athy, Co Kildare, were unsuccessful. A fascination for the belongings of owners of castles and stately homes will always attract potential buyers to auctions. So, Aidan Foley’s auction next week of almost 1,000 items from Castle Matrix, the former home of retired US air force pilot Colonel John O’Driscoll should draw some interest. O’Driscoll was aide to General Douglas MacArthur when he accepted the Japanese surrender in 1945. On his retirement in 1961, O’Driscoll bought and restored the dilapidated manor house near Rathkeale, Co Limerick. Originally built in the 15th century as a tower house for the Fitzgeralds, Earls of Desmond, Castle Matrix was later converted to a manor house by the Southwell family. It had been owned by the Johnstone family before O’Driscoll purchased it and opened it up for medieval-style banquets in the 1970s. Castle Matrix also served as headquarters of the International Institute of Military History and the Heraldry Society of Ireland. It remained open for tours until O’Driscoll’s death in 1991. As well as a large collection of historic books, there are more than 50 antique guns from Castle Matrix in the Foley auction. These guns, which the Garda took into storage at Collins Barracks in Cork following O’Driscoll’s death, are being sold in association with Pat Hayes, a registered firearms dealer, who must ensure any purchaser has acquired a gun licence before collecting their purchase. “It has been a difficult process to get the guns to auction, but they will be made available by Pat Hayes for viewing in Doneraile,” says Aidan Foley. Viewing for all lots continues today, tomorrow and Monday in Aidan Foley’s auction rooms in Doneraile, Co Cork. Restorers of historic houses may be interested in viewing the six 18th and 19th century fireplaces, alongside fenders and fire surrounds, at Hegarty’s live online auction on Wednesday, September 24th from 11am. The fireplaces, which include an Italian marble mantel with painted tiles and an embossed Adams-style motif from the Metropole Hotel in Cork (€6,000-€8,000), originated in Noble Antiques, a renowned specialist in antique fireplaces in Cork city, which is now closing down. An early 18th century simple framed Queen Anne-style marble fireplace is another item of potential interest (€5,000-€7,000). Finally, amid jewellery, gold and silver coins and silver bullion at Matthews’ live online auction on Tuesday, September 23rd from 5.30pm, are some quirky silver pieces. Perfect for gifts, these include a silver mustard pot with a blue glass lining (€30-€50); a silver-cased aide-memoire notebook pendant (€40-€70); and a silver pen rest with an intricate filigree domed lid (€150-€250).

More Info Back in 2021, Texas passed two laws that restricted the state from doing business with companies deemed hostile to the fossil fuels and firearm industries. The Lone Star State barred pensions and other state entities from investing in approximately 350 funds that promote environmental, social and governance, aka ESG investing, claiming that ESG investing does not act in the best financial interests of their clients. To wit, the Republican-leaning state banned Wall Street giants Citigroup Inc., BlackRock Inc., Barclays Plc and members of Net Zero Banking Alliance, saying ESG is “…just a hate factory.” The anti-ESG movement has since gained traction, mostly targeting financial services like banks, pension funds and asset managers, as well as the energy sector. And now a new report by GlobalData reveals how the U.S. has become the epicenter of a rising tide of anti-ESG sentiment across the globe. The report points to a Pleiades Strategy tracker that reveals that a total of 370 anti-ESG bills were submitted to the legislatures of 40 U.S. states between 2021 and 2024. GlobalData notes that, whereas few of those bills were signed into law, this does not signify that the anti-ESG movement has weakened. Indeed, an analysis by Ropes & Gray found that anti-ESG bills filed in 2024 enjoyed a significantly higher rate of success than those filed in prior years, indicating that the architects of these bills are becoming more effective at drafting legislative challenges. Not surprisingly, the anti-ESG movement has gained massive momentum since the re-election of Donald Trump as U.S. President. Trump has rolled back many climate action policies by the previous administration, taken aim at DEI policies and passed executive orders banning ESG investing. Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBBA) has rolled back many clean energy credits enacted by former President Joe Biden under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022. Whereas OBBBA did not outright cancel the Section 45V clean hydrogen production tax credits as earlier feared, it did accelerate the deadline for projects to begin construction to be eligible for the credit, bringing the deadline forward to December 31, 2027, from January 1, 2033, as originally envisioned in Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022. Trump’s anti-climate actions are similar to his stance in his first term when he unraveled more than 100 climate policies. There are estimates that nearly $28 billion-worth of wind, solar, EV and battery projects have been delayed or cancelled since Trump took office, with a potential 19,000 jobs chopped. “Since President Trump’s re-election in November 2024, the efforts of the anti-ESG movement have ratcheted up, and all companies (not just those in the financial services industry) lie within the movement’s scope,” the GlobalData report states. “Trump has unravelled much of the previous administration’s climate action policies, passed executive orders banning ESG investing and taken aim at DEI policies.” Meanwhile, efforts by the European Union to simplify its regulatory landscape have frequently seen the bloc slide towards anti-ESG, with growing right-wing populism bolstering climate skepticism across the globe. International markets have opposed advancing ESG standards through initiatives like the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) and European Green Deal that enforce sustainability criteria by requiring disclosure of ESG-related risks. GlobalData has predicted that the anti-ESG movement will ultimately impact companies across all industries, including institutions and other entities previously considered to be fully independent. Not surprisingly, Big Oil companies have been scaling back their clean energy investments. Last year, oil and gas giant Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE:XOM) announced that it will not move forward with one of the world's largest low-carbon hydrogen projects if the federal government failed to provide tax incentives for natural gas-fed facilities. Current guidelines provide incentives for projects that produce "green" hydrogen by using water and renewable energy, but Exxon wants them extended to"blue" hydrogen from gas by trapping carbon emissions. That’s an interesting take because Exxon CEO Darren Woods previously expressed his doubts about the efficacy of carbon capture at lowering emissions because “…the technology works for high concentration streams of gases but is too expensive for low concentration streams.” BP Inc. (NYSE:BP) has unveiled a less aggressive decarbonization strategy that entails (1) a slower decline in upstream investments and scrapped former plans to shrink refining; (2) focus more on higher-margin hydrogen and biofuels as well as offshore wind; and (3) higher spending in both oil and gas as well as low-carbon. According to the company, the new strategy will offer higher shareholder returns, especially critical to the company after it severed ties with Russia’s Rosneft. BP’s nearly 20% stake in Rosneft helped to add several billion dollars to its bottom line every year. Back in April, BP announced that it was abandoning its hydrogen ambitions in favor of liquefied natural gas (LNG) for transport. Then in July, the European oil major announced that it would exit the $36-billion green hydrogen production facility planned in Australia. BP has informed its Australian Renewable Energy Hub (AREH) partners that it will leave its role as the project’s operator and equity holder. Shell Plc. (NYSE:SHEL) has revealed it had scrapped plans to build a low-carbon hydrogen plant in Norway citing lack of demand. Days later, Norway’s NOC Equinor ASA (NYSE:EQNR) announced similar plans, "We haven't seen the market for blue hydrogen materialize and decided not to progress the project," a Shell spokesperson told Reuters.

Paschal Sheehy Southern Editor More than 100 venues across Cork will open tonight as part of Culture Night events in the city. They will include music and dance, literature and visual arts. Many of the events are concentrated in the city centre, with activities also in Blackpool, Togher, Churchfield and Mayfield. Online, Cork International Film Festival will present a selection of short films. Events are presented by Cork City Council in collaboration with the Arts Council. Some events require pre-booking, and details of all events taking place in the city are available at the Cork City Council website. Cian Sweeney presents 'As If I Always Knew: A Piano Meditation' in the Cork City Hall's concert hall; a variety of choirs will entertain on the City Hall plaza; a multi-panel art piece from Mahon Community Arts Project will be on display in the atrium; and the Millennium Hall will see a fun show called 'Squish, Stomp, Spin - The Magic of Stim', by performance artist and neurodiversity activist, Moss Russell. "It's my favourite night of the year," Moss Russell told RTÉ News as she looked ahead to Culture Night. "I love being part of it, I love performing in it, but I really miss running around and watching all the amazing things that are happening - just hopping from place to place, getting all of this free culture. It's absolutely one of the best nights of the year." Rappers and musicians from the Kabin Krew studio will celebrate the release of their new album, 'Up The Kabin', when they deliver a pop-up performance on Corn Market Street at 8pm. Kabin Krew Rapper Aaron Hennessy -- who earlier this year recorded with RTÉ's Bryan Dobson - is a big fan of Culture Night. "It's brilliant, yeah," Aaron said. "We've loads of opportunities and loads of decent stuff going on tonight." Cork City Library will host exhibitions, live music, theatre, readings, children's storytelling and creative workshops. Among the highlights will be the Rory Gallagher-inspired 'Kickback City' exhibition, an adaptation Coleridge’s 'The Rime of the Ancient Mariner' and music from Áine O’Gorman. There will be Irish language activities, in association with An t-Oireachtas, including award-winning sean-nós singer Sorcha de Róiste who will present a unique workshop celebrating traditional Irish song and 'Amhráin na Mara' (Songs of the Sea), a celebration of maritime songs in both Irish and English. MTU buildings across the city will open their doors too. Centre piece will be a multi-venue exhibition of works by MTU Crawford College of Art and Design alumni, in the James Barry Exhibition Centre in Bishopstown and also at Grand Parade. There will be talks at Blackrock Castle Observatory and a night of music and theatre at the Cork School of Music. At UCC, there will be conversation and music "as gaeilge" in Áras Uí Rathaille, trad music in the Hub, a Chinese cultural experience in the Boole Library, and a walking tour of UCC’s LGBT+ history at the iconic Clock Tower. Visitors can also enjoy live music at the Department of Music, theatre workshops at the Granary Theatre, and a literature evening in the Boole library, while Visitor Services will host children’s story time and guided walks.

Title: AI Agents Are Coming For Your Buildings. Is Your Office Ready?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/ronschmelzer/2025/09/19/ai-agents-are-coming-for-your-buildings-is-your-office-ready/

ByRon Schmelzer, Contributor. So-called intelligent automation has been in buildings for decades. Facility systems could dim lights or adjust temperatures, but only after humans set the rules. Operators fiddled with thermostats, tweaked schedules, and tried to balance comfort with utility bills. These systems followed instructions. They didn’t think. Now Trane Technologies is taking a different approach. This week the company rolled out AI Control and ARIA, an AI agent for buildings. The move marks a push from pre-programmed automation toward adaptive intelligence. It also fits into a broader trend. Companies in many industries are embedding AI agents into daily operations so that machines no longer just assist, they act. Conventional Building Automation Systems work like scripts. Once written, they run. Trane’s new AI Control is closer to a continuously adaptive process. It draws data from weather forecasts, occupancy sensors, and energy meters, then makes adjustments every few minutes. Heating and cooling shift on the fly, not just at set times. Trane says this approach can cut up to 25% of energy use and reduce emissions by as much as 40%. Commercial real estate consumes almost 40% of global energy, so the stakes are high. Even small improvements can translate to billions saved and a measurable climate benefit. “Our vision is to unlock next-generation building performance, delivering both immediate and long-term benefits for our customers and the planet,” said Riaz Raihan, Senior Vice President and Chief Digital Officer, Trane Technologies, according to a recent press release. Unlike a BAS dashboard that waits for commands, ARIA, Trane’s AI building agent, uses a conversational approach with building staff. Ask it for an energy forecast, a performance update, or a system change. It responds, acts, and adapts. That shifts the role of facility managers. Rather than tuning equipment line by line, they supervise a digital operator that never takes a break. Similar patterns are already playing out elsewhere. In retail, autonomous shopping bots fill carts. In finance, algorithmic systems trade at high speed. Buildings could be next. Buildings generate tons of data. HVAC sensors, security feeds, and occupancy trackers continuously churn out data. Yet much of it goes unused because teams can’t respond fast enough. But AI agents can. ARIA’s five-minute optimization cycles allow adjustments that humans could never sustain. Over time, those small improvements can accumulate into large savings. The timing matters. Energy costs remain unpredictable, and regulators are raising the bar. In New York City, Local Law 97 fines owners who exceed emissions caps. Smarter systems don’t just save money, they help properties avoid penalties. These new tools emerged from Trane’s recently launched BrainBox AI Lab, acquired earlier this year to accelerate Trane’s AI innovation pipeline. Positioned as an incubator, the lab focuses on rapid development of control strategies that improve efficiency without manual oversight. Competitors are moving in the same direction. Johnson Controls has been folding machine learning into its OpenBlue platform. Siemens has expanded its Desigo CC system with AI modules that highlight integration across building systems. Trane is trying to stand apart by framing ARIA as a system that doesn’t just provide data, but takes initiative. Across industries, AI agents are seeing increasing adoption. In retail, Walmart, Instacart, and Shopify are testing digital buyers that anticipate needs and complete orders. In finance, trading platforms at JPMorgan and BlackRock use autonomous systems to scan markets and act on risk models. Healthcare companies are also making agentic AI investments, with Philips and GE Healthcare are piloting agents in ICUs that monitor patients continuously, freeing staff from constant checks. The common thread is that tools once seen as assistants now operate independently. Humans step back into oversight roles. For all the potential, adoption in the building industry faces challenges. Trust is the first issue. Managers won’t cede control without safeguards. They need clear explanations for why the system acts, along with an override button when comfort or safety is at stake. These systems also need to prove their value. AI agents need to show that they can deliver better results than their human counterparts. Early deployments will face close scrutiny as facility managers track cost reductions and emissions savings. Other industries show how this might play out. Finance managers resisted algorithmic trading until performance proved to be a competitive advantage. Healthcare hesitated with diagnostic AI until error rates dropped and clinicians saw the benefit. Facility management may follow a similar path. If systems like ARIA catch on, the role of the facility manager changes. Instead of adjusting dampers and thermostats, they’ll monitor, interpret, and decide when to intervene. The work becomes less mechanical and more strategic. That echoes changes in trading floors, hospitals, and retail supply chains. People now guide the agents rather than carry out every action. Trane’s release is a sign of the change in the industry. Within a few years, AI-native control may become the baseline for commercial properties, not a premium add-on. The unknowns lie in the business model. Will operators pay recurring fees for optimization? Will insurers reward AI-run properties with lower premiums? Will tenants expect AI-managed comfort as part of the lease? For now, Trane has made its move. The company is betting that buildings with their own digital operator will define the next stage of “smart.”

Title: Blackrock clinic co-founder among objectors to apartment plans

James M Sheehan. the co-founder of the Blackrock, Hermitage and Galway Clinics, is opposing plans by Cairn Homes for 252 residential ‘build to sell’ units in Blackrock in south Dublin. Mr Sheehan is one of over 30 local residents opposing the scheme which is made up of 236 apartments and 16 houses at Chesterfield, Cross Avenue, Blackrock, Co. Dublin. The 236 apartments are to be located in two blocks ranging in height from five to eight storeys while the 16 homes will be five bedroom terrace houses. In his objection, Mr Sheehan claims that the scheme “will erode the long established character of the neighbourhood”. Mr Sheehan of Cross Avenue, Blackrock contends that “numerous properties will lose their privacy due to the height of the proposed apartment blocks”. He said that the “high rise blocks are inappropriate for this neighbourhood” and argues that it is overdevelopment. Mr Sheehan states that “a low rise development with open spaces could be appropriate such as St Helen’s Wood”. In a comprehensive objection lodged on behalf of Catherine Greene, planning consultant, David Armstrong contends that “the over-development and over-densification of this suburban site will result in a congested form of development and a poor standard of amenity for future residents”. Mr Armstrong contends that “the proposal will result in negative impacts due to loss of residential amenity, visual amenity traffic and overspill parking.” Alan and Charlotte Sullivan of Cross Avenue, Blackrock contend that “there is undoubtedly very significant local opposition to the proposed development”. The O’Sullivans state that “it appears clear to us from the size of the proposed development that the objective is to maximise commercial gain at the expense of amenity in the local area and in disregard of local residents and the local community”. Cairn has been trying to develop the site for the past seven years and last year An Coimisiún Pleanála refused planning permission for 355 build to rent apartments as it would lead to an over-proliferation of build to rent apartments for the area. Addressing ACP’s grounds for refusal on the proliferation of ‘built to rent’ apartments for the area, planning consultants for the new scheme, McCutcheon Halley Chartered Planning Consultants (MHP) state that new scheme in contrast “offers 252 built to sell (BTS) units, which align with the identified housing needs in Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County Council and contributes to addressing Ireland’s housing demand”. MHP say the scheme “will facilitate increased housing supply and choice along Cross Avenue and its environs, which is also located 1km southwest of Blackrock Village”. A decision is due next month.
