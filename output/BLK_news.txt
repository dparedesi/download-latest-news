Comment Jim Adler, founder and general partner at Toyota Ventures, is concerned that climate technology gains could fall into the “valley of death” if companies fail to drum up enough demand to survive. And he’s not wrong to be worried. Climate tech investments in the first half of 2024 dipped for the second consecutive year, both in terms of overall funds invested and deal count as investors shy away from funding what can be capital-intensive, high-risk businesses without a clear path to market. Speaking at a Climate Week NYC event Tuesday, Adler said one way for climate tech to secure that demand is through forward offtake agreements. This is when a customer promises to buy an agreed-upon amount of a product at a specified price by a specified date. “I like that a lot because that encourages investors to invest to hit that date,” Adler told TechCrunch. “We do early-stage investment, which is a telescope into the future … If we know there’s a customer then we and other investors will invest at the early stage because we know we’re investing for something.” During a presentation to a room of about 75 people in midtown Manhattan, Adler laid out how historically, disruptive technologies — from railways to oil pipelines to electric power — have only been able to scale once they hit the tipping point of 10% to 20% adoption rates. Even if sectors have enough supply and innovation, if they don’t hit those rates, “the dynamics of capitalism don’t kick in,” Adler said. “If the demand doesn’t show up, the tech dies,” he continued. “Capitalism is a way to scale these technologies, but not if the customers don’t show up. So how do we help customers show up?” This is an especially prescient question when we consider that growth-stage deals in climate tech declined 33% in the first half of the year compared to the same period last year, per a CTVC report. That hinders the growth of companies that have proven their tech on a smaller scale and need additional funds to expand. Adler says growth-stage investors won’t invest without clear demand signals from customers, like forward offtake agreements. So how do startups get customers to make such agreements? Pushing the levers of government mandates is one way. Take Revel, for example, the startup that started as an e-moped sharing company and now is pursuing EV charging infrastructure. While organic demand for Revel’s charging services today is likely low — it’s mainly buffeted by ride-hail and taxi drivers, both from Revel’s own small service and Uber, Lyft, yellow cab and livery drivers — mandates from states like California and New York that require all new car sales to be electric by 2035 provide investors with a much-needed demand signal. Revel has raised around $270 million, per PitchBook data, with heavy hitters like BlackRock leading the startup’s rounds. Adler said he’s hoping low-carbon fuels, like hydrogen, will have their own moment in securing future demand. “If hydrogen shows up at $2 per kilogram in bulk, that could really push adoption to the right and up the curve,” he said. “Investors can then invest knowing that there’s a customer at the end of this in some volume,” Adler said. “It’s super important. If this doesn’t happen, I think we all need to be a little worried.” Correction: A previous version of this article neglected to include that Revel’s EV charging customer base today includes ride-hail and taxi drivers from other apps and services.

Title: Shell to Outsource $30B Pension to BlackRock

BlackRock has announced that the $10 trillion asset manager was selected as the outsourced fiduciary manager of Stichting Shell Pensioenfonds, the defined benefit pension fund of Shell plc. Shell will outsource asset management of its 27-billion-euro ($30 billion) fund entirely to BlackRock. As of August 31, SSPF had a funded status of 134.5%, well above the fund’s minimum required funding ratio of 105%. As of December 31, 2023, the fund had 5,206 participants, 6,468 former participants and 18,160 beneficiaries who joined the company before July 1, 2013, and are based in the Netherlands. The transfer of Shell’s pension assets to BlackRock is expected to be completed by mid-2025. Asset management for Shell’s Shell Nederland Pensioenfonds Stichting pension fund in the Netherlands, for employees who joined the company on or after July 1, 2013, will remain unchanged under Achmea Investment Management, according to Shell. Want the latest institutional investment industry news and insights? Sign up for CIO newsletters.  Globally, more than $300 billion of assets have been transferred to BlackRock’s OCIO business to date. BlackRock was named a winner in the asset management and servicing OCIO category at the 2023 CIO Industry Innovation Awards. As a part of the outsourcing, Shell’s pension will move to a defined contribution model, as required by the Netherlands Future Pensions Act. BlackRock will assist in the transition to the new pension system. A spokesperson for Shell could not be immediately reached for comment. Future Pensions Act Shell’s appointment of BlackRock as its fiduciary manager comes as the Netherlands plans a complete overhaul of the country’s pension system by the end of the decade. As part of the Dutch Future Pensions Act, which came into effect in July 2023, all defined benefit plans are required to switch to a defined contribution system. Pension funds based in the country have until January 1, 2028, to make the switch. “In light of the developments regarding the Future Pensions Act and the request from our social partners to transition, the Board has decided, after a careful selection process, to appoint BlackRock as fiduciary manager for SSPF,” said Kenan Yildirim, director of Stichting Shell Pensioenfonds, in a statement. The law requires defined benefit plan sponsors to submit a transition plan by January 1, 2025. “In anticipation of the upcoming changes, the appointment of BlackRock will safeguard the execution of the investment process and ensure that the costs and risks of the transition are carefully managed,” Yildirim continued in the statement. “In addition, our participants will benefit from BlackRock’s expertise, global scale and experience in risk management and sustainability.” Related Stories: UPS Hires Goldman Sachs Asset Management as OCIO for $43.4 Billion Pension Plans Cerity Partners Merges with Agility in OCIO Push BlackRock to Acquire Alternatives Data Provider Preqin Tags: BlackRock, Defined Benefit, Defined Contribution, OCIO, outsourced CIO, Shell, Stichting Shell Pensioenfonds « CalSTRS Promotes 2 to Investment Director

In a challenging market environment, TCP Capital Corp (TCPC) stock has reached a 52-week low, trading at $8.25. This price level reflects a significant downturn for the investment firm, which has experienced a -29.11% change over the past year. Investors are closely monitoring the company's performance as it navigates through the prevailing economic headwinds that have impacted its valuation. The 52-week low serves as a critical indicator for the market participants who track the stock's resilience and potential for recovery in the coming months. In other recent news, BlackRock TCP Capital (NASDAQ:TCPC) Corp has undergone a significant leadership reshuffle, with Rajneesh Vig stepping down as Chairman and CEO. Philip Tseng has been appointed to fill these roles, while Jason Mehring will assume the position of President. Other key appointments include Patrick Wolfe as COO and Dan Worrell joining Tseng as Co-Chief Investment Officer. These changes come alongside the company's strong financial performance, with Q2 2024 earnings reporting an adjusted net investment income of $0.38 per share and an annualized return on average equity of approximately 14%. The company also declared a third-quarter dividend of $0.34 per share. In a major financial move, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) TCP Capital Corp repaid $250 million of the 2024 Notes, leading to an increase in the company's asset coverage ratio to 180.2%. These recent developments reflect the company's strategic plan for a seamless transition and its commitment to maintaining a diversified investment portfolio. Analysts have noted the firm's disciplined underwriting standards and active restructuring efforts for several companies. The company's financial strategy, executive changes, and performance are based on recent press releases and earnings reports. In light of TCP Capital Corp's (TCPC) recent performance, InvestingPro data provides a comprehensive view of the company's financial health. As of the last twelve months leading up to Q2 2024, TCPC's revenue has grown by 16.64%, indicating a positive trajectory in its earning capacity. Despite the stock trading near its 52-week low, the company has maintained a robust dividend yield of 23.44%, which is a testament to its commitment to returning value to shareholders, as evidenced by 13 consecutive years of dividend payments. InvestingPro Tips suggest caution due to the stock being in oversold territory, which could signal a potential rebound or further declines depending on market conditions. Moreover, the fact that four analysts have revised their earnings downwards for the upcoming period could imply future challenges. However, TCPC's liquid assets surpassing short-term obligations is a reassuring sign of financial stability.

Title: MicroStrategy Outpaces BlackRock's IBIT by Over 3x Year-to-Date
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2024/09/24/microstrategy-outpaces-blackrocks-ibit-by-over-3x-year-to-date/

Full Content:
Election 2024 coverage presented by Note: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates. Disclosure: The writer owns shares in MicroStrategy. The launch of U.S. bitcoin exchange-traded funds on Jan. 11, 2024, has become one of the year's most significant financial events. These ETFs, including the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), have collectively attracted $17.7 billion in net inflows since their debut, according to Farside data. IBIT, to some, has emerged as a competitor to MicroStrategy (MSTR), a company renowned for its substantial bitcoin holdings and dual business model. Led by Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy currently holds 252,220 bitcoins, valued at approximately $16 billion. Year-to-date, MicroStrategy's stock has risen 119% compared to IBIT's 35%, reflecting a more than threefold outperformance. From the opening of the ETFs until around Feb. 23, IBIT outperformed MicroStrategy as investors either shifted capital to the new funds or took profits on what had been a large run higher in MSTR's stock in the weeks prior to Jan. 11. This trend of profit-taking spread to bitcoin as well, as long-term holders (those holding bitcoin for 155 days or more) sold approximately one million bitcoin from December 2023 through the first quarter of 2024, according to Glassnode data. There are several key reasons for MicroStrategy's impressive returns and its ability to outperform IBIT. One of the first factors is fees. ETFs come with an expense ratio—currently 0.25% for IBIT—which acts as a drag on returns. In contrast, MicroStrategy does not charge such a fee to shareholders, making it more attractive over time in terms of cost efficiency. Furthermore, MicroStrategy operates as a business that generates revenue beyond its bitcoin thesis, primarily through its analytics operations. This diversification allows the company to produce free cash flow and could provide some cushioning during bitcoin's drawdowns even as the stock outperforms during the token's rallies. Since bitcoin's all-time high in March, bitcoin has decreased by 13% and IBIT is down 14%, while MicroStrategy has declined by 15%. Additionally, MicroStrategy has the flexibility to increase its bitcoin per share through debt or equity offerings. For example, it recently upsized a convertible note offering from $700 million to $1.01 billion, using the proceeds to acquire more bitcoin—something IBIT cannot do directly, unless it sees more inflows from investors. Mark Palmer, Senior Research Analyst at Benchmark, said MicroStrategy's recent financial strategies, such as issuing convertible bonds and retiring high-interest debt, have improved its financial flexibility and made the stock more efficient access to capital markets compared to other bitcoin-buying stocks. "A strong case could be made that MSTR following the convert issuance and senior notes retirement had more flexibility to access the capital markets than it had prior to it given its lighter interest burden and increased holdings of unencumbered bitcoins," said Palmer, who has a buy rating on the stock and price target of $215. In terms of marketing and visibility, MicroStrategy has also maintained a higher ranking in Google search trend than IBIT, signaling better recognition and interest. This gap has, however narrowed of late, as options trading on IBIT have now been approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC).

Skip to comments. Posted on 09/24/2024 7:32:06 AM PDT by marcusmaximus VLADIMIR Putin's cursed naval flagship is unlikely to ever sail again after he sent its crew to fight in the war in Ukraine. The Admiral Kuznetsov is the tyrant's only aircraft carrier and has not been in service for eight years. Desperate Vlad has now designated some of the rustbucket's 1,500 crew members as cannon fodder for his brutal invasion. The seamen have formed a land-based "frigate" battalion within Russia's 1st Guards Tank Army, according to OSINT investigator Moklasen. Some of them have already gone missing or died, Forbes reported. Putin had wanted the 305-metre-long Soviet-era warship to play a role in the war but the accident-prone vessel with up to 2,000 crew will sink if it sails again.

Title: Who is Shorting Trump Media & Technology Group Corp
(NASDAQ: DJT) stock

Skip to comments. Posted on 09/24/2024 7:12:39 AM PDT by Eleutheria5 I bought my first ETFs of DJT (the flag ship corporation of Truth Social) months ago at over $30.00. Despite Trump's rise in the polls, two assassination attempts, and loads of revelations about his new opponent's shortcomings, the stock price has slid from that high to $11.75, and each time it slid more, I doubled down and bought more at the cheaper price, which is bogging down my limited portfolio. Now it's finally going up, and at the start of business today rose by about 75 cents and is still rising. One possible explanation is that some rich, powerful person is deliberately shorting the security. And there's a regular rogue's gallery of rich Trump haters who might do so. Fortunately, we have some history to teach us a course of action. About a year or so ago, fat cats had decided to short a popular sporting goods store out of existence, and small-time investors on the Robin Hood platform put a stop to it, by consistently buying en masse the stock, forcing the price up. Their rebellion was duly punished, and Robin Hood put a stop to their uppitiness. But the lesson remains learned, and I propose we do so for our fearless leader's flagship stock as well. It's still at 12.53 a share or thereabouts, climbing up from a low of 11.75 this morning. So those of you who have money to invest, buy some DJT stock now, while it's still cheap. If enough people do so, it will drive the price up even further. Full disclosure. You'll also be bailing my stagnating margin out of the doldrums in a big way, giving me liquidity to venture on more investments, and grow my wealth, such as it is.

And there's a regular rogue's gallery of rich Trump haters who might do so. Fortunately, we have some history to teach us a course of action. About a year or so ago, fat cats had decided to short a popular sporting goods store out of existence, and small-time investors on the Robin Hood platform put a stop to it, by consistently buying en masse the stock, forcing the price up. Their rebellion was duly punished, and Robin Hood put a stop to their uppitiness. But the lesson remains learned, and I propose we do so for our fearless leader's flagship stock as well. It's still at 12.53 a share or thereabouts, climbing up from a low of 11.75 this morning. So those of you who have money to invest, buy some DJT stock now, while it's still cheap.

Bitcoin Bitcoin has surged since crashing to September lows of around $52,000 as JPMorgan's chief executive leads a flurry of serious inflation warnings. Subscribe now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor and "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains" in the aftermath of bitcoin's halving earthquake! The bitcoin price has rocketed over the last two years, rocketing by over 200%, largely due to the BlackRock-led Wall Street bitcoin revolution (which is suddenly hurtling toward a fresh earthquake). Now, as details emerge of a secret meeting between Elon Musk and El Salvador's bitcoin-backing president Nayib Bukele, China has unleashed a flood of stimulus measures designed to prop up its stalling economy, hot on the heels of the U.S. Federal Reserve cutting interest rates and kicking off a global monetary policy easing cycle.

[+] depressed investor confidence in the country, potentially feeding into the bitcoin price and crypto market. People’s Bank of China governor Pan Gongsheng has announced a series of "bold" stimulus measures, cutting bank reserves by 50 basis points and reducing mortgage rates to spur economic growth. "I think these are pretty bold moves from authorities," Kyle Rodda, senior financial market analyst at Capital.Com, told Reuters. "It doesn't qualify as 'big bang' stimulus. It's mostly targeted at financial markets and supporting the banking system... Overall, for investors, it's a very bullish thing." "More and bolder easing measures could also be in store in the coming quarters," Vasu Menon, managing director of investment strategy at OCBC, added. The bitcoin price and wider crypto market has so far failed to move on the news out of China even as stocks across Asia soared to their highest in more than two and half years. "Bitcoin's lack of response to this news, juxtaposed against rallying Chinese indices, highlights that its current beta appears more tightly linked to Fed policy and U.S. markets, as evidenced by near two-year high correlations with U.S. stocks, particularly following last week's FOMC [Federal Open Market Committee] meeting," Rick Maeda, a Singapore-based research analyst at Presto Research, told Coindesk. Last week, the Fed's historical 0.5% interest rate cut pushed the bitcoin price sharply higher as traders braced for the beginning of a new liquidity cycle. The Federal Reserve interest rate cut and stimulus from China are predicted to trigger a bitcoin price surge over the next few years by some bullish investors.

"I still have a $1 million [bitcoin] price target," Arthur Hayes, a cofounder of bitcoin and crypto derivatives pioneer BitMex who went on to set up the Maelstrom investment fund, told Coindesk last week. "I'm more of a 2026, 2027 sort of person. Next year, we really get a ramp up in fiscal spending regardless of who wins the U.S. election. And if the U.S. dollar declines a lot, then China has room to enact stimulus as well and keep the yuan stable. And then you have the rest of the major central banks following in the footsteps of the Fed. They look at the Fed; they're easing so we can ease too." Hayes has previously said he expects a China "bazooka" combined with the Fed easing to create a "glorious" crypto bull market. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: Amazon, ExxonMobil, Meta, Tesla, Others Labeled ‘Underminers of Democracy’
URL: https://www.webpronews.com/amazon-exxonmobil-meta-tesla-others-labeled-underminers-of-democracy/
Time Published: 2024-09-24T03:47:04Z
Full Content:
A report by the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) is calling out some of the world’s biggest companies, saying they undermine democracy worldwide. The ITUC says its mission is “the promotion and defence of workers’ rights and interests, through international cooperation between trade unions, global campaigning and advocacy within the major global institutions.” Tune in: How Major U.S. Firms Got Branded as Undermining Democracy! The ITUC has published a list calling out the top seven “emblematic companies that benefit financially by continuing to violate trade union and human rights, monopolise media and technology, exacerbate climate catastrophe, and privatise public services. They represent a wider corporate world that protects and expands its own profits by undermining democracy.” The list includes: The organization then goes on to describe why each company made it on to the list. ITUC calls out Amazon for its repeated privacy violations, worker endangerment, and opposition to labor laws. The world’s largest online retailer and cloud computing service, and its fifth-largest employer, there is no industry or community Amazon and its subsidiaries have not adversely impacted. The company has become notorious for its union busting and low wages on multiple continents, monopoly in e-commerce, egregious carbon emissions through its AWS data centres, corporate tax evasion, and lobbying at national and international level. In the United States alone, where Amazon’s worker injury rate is twice as high as similar companies, the company has racked up more than US$250 million in fines for privacy, occupational health and safety, wage, and environmental violation cases filed by workers across sectors. Attempts to hold Amazon accountable to labour rights have led the company to challenge the constitutionality of the National Labor Relations Board in the U.S. In Canada, the company is trying to overturn provincial labour law. In Europe, Amazon was barred this year from lobbying within the European Parliament for its refusal to attend hearings on violations of worker rights in its warehouses, becoming only the second company in history to face such a sanction. Its refusal to negotiate with unions in Germany has resulted in a decade of strikes. In India, the company has admitted to breaching workplace safety standards in its warehouses. Blackstone Group makes the list for opposition to violations of consumer protection laws, violating employment laws, employing child labor, and harming the environment, including deforestation of the Amazon. Blackstone is well-known by climate justice advocates for its role in the rapid deforestation of the Amazon rainforest and huge investments in fossil fuel projects. In the UK, Blackstone reaped huge profits while saddling one of the country’s largest long-term care providers with insurmountable debt. Blackstone infamously profited from housing market speculation after the 2008 financial crisis and aggressively evicted workers after the Covid-19 pandemic. Blackstone and its subsidiaries have been penalised for competition, contracting, employment, financial and consumer protection violations to the tune of nearly US$300 million in one country alone. It was also the face of child labour in meatpacking, is known for its exorbitant fees to manage worker pensions, and has so far failed to sign up to a coalition-designed Private Equity Labor Rights Platform. In Brazil, it has been criticised for helping to privatise public infrastructure and corporatise agricultural land. Blackstone seems to believe that it – not voters – should determine public policy. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on housing has accused Blackstone of, “using its significant resources and political leverage to undermine domestic laws and policies that would in fact improve access to adequate housing.” ExxonMobil’s inclusion on the list should come as a surprise to no one, given the company’s long history of hiding its finding about the impact of fossil fuels on the environment. Perhaps the greatest example of Exxon’s disinterest in democratic deliberation was its corporate commitment of nearly four decades to conceal from the public its own internal evidence that climate change was real, accelerating, and driven by fossil fuel use while simultaneously financing far-right think tanks in the US and Europe to inject climate scepticism and denialism into the public discourse. While it altered its public position on climate change years ago, Exxon continues to lobby against meaningful climate policy and still promotes fossil fuel and plastics use to the detriment of communities around the world. It benefits from another entry on our list, Meta, by spreading right-wing propaganda in favour of fossil fuels. It finances the Republican Attorneys General Association, which has led efforts to pressure the US Supreme Court to throw out climate change lawsuits seeking damages from Exxon and its competitors. Glencore has a track record of flaunting the law, pleading guilty to various charges in a number of countries. The largest trader of commodities and the largest mining company in the world by revenue, Glencore controls or produces huge portions of the global supply of coal, zinc, cobalt, and other minerals, metals, fuels and foods. The company’s undermining of democracy is not in dispute, as it has in recent years pled guilty to committing bribery, corruption, and market manipulation in countries as varied as Venezuela, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Cote d’Ivoire, Nigeria, and South Sudan. The scale of Glencore’s global lobbying lays bare the organisational conviction that it, rather than the voting public, should determine policy. While it publicly shows itself to support measures such as the Paris Agreement and the UN Sustainable Development Goals, for years it has made use of right-wing consultants to spend “millions bankrolling a secret, globally coordinated campaign to prop up coal demand by undermining environmental activists, influencing politicians and spreading sophisticated pro-coal messaging on social media.” This self-serving posture is also exhibited in its efforts to undermine popular climate policy in the European Union, the United States, and South Africa. Meta’s role in politics and its ability to influence people, including its users falling victim to misinformation, has long made the company the target of critics and led to its inclusion on the list. The world’s largest social media company, Meta is the parent of Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Threads, and Messenger. Combined, these products have nearly four billion users – the same number of people estimated to be voting worldwide in 2024. The company’s scale, and its corporate behaviour, have led some to call it “a foreign state, populated by people without sovereignty, ruled by a leader with absolute power.” Meta’s algorithms can quite literally alter humanity’s perceptions of reality. Its revenue model exploits trillions of personalised data points to deliver highly effective advertising to its users. That has made it a perfect target for data breaches seized on by authoritarians and an ideal vessel for right-wing political parties to spread propaganda around the world. Violent, far-right militias in the US use Facebook to recruit new members. In Germany, the far-right AfD used Facebook to stoke anti-immigrant hatred and position itself for unprecedented success in June’s European parliamentary elections. While Tesla may be the world’s leading EV maker, that standing has come at the expense of workers rights, with the company engaging in a long history of combating unionization efforts. In Germany, Sweden, and the US, Tesla has aggressively violated the right to organise, refused to engage in collective bargaining, and provoked unprecedented strike action for its subversion of social dialogue, a pillar of industrial democracy in many European economies. Tesla’s hostility toward unions earned it a place on a list of Worst Union-Busters of 2023. Tesla’s factories have “reported ten times more safety violations than Nissan … despite the fact that Nissan built almost ten times as many cars over the same period.” But Tesla does not limit its efforts to weaken democratic norms in highly industrialised economies. Its supply chain relies on nickel mining companies that undermine consultation standards with local Indonesian communities and are deforesting so rapidly that flooding and water pollution threaten neighbourhoods. The company’s supply chain relies on another corporation on our list, Glencore, to mine copper and cobalt in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where child labour has allegedly been employed. The Vanguard Group makes the list for concentrating its power to such a degree that even its founder was worried about where the company was headed. One of the “Big Four” institutional investors in the world alongside BlackRock, Fidelity, and State Street, Vanguard’s holdings put it “into an extreme position of power” at many of the companies it funds and makes it “the voice that matters most among investors.” This concentration of power troubled even Vanguard’s late founder, John Bogle, who wrote in 2018 that “If historical trends continue, a handful of giant institutional investors will one day hold voting control of virtually every large US corporation.” Despite holding billions of dollars in worker money, Vanguard recently abandoned one of its most public commitments to environmental and social governance. After signing on to the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative in 2021, it left in 2022, bowing to pressure from its far-right friends and provoking a backlash from more than 1,000 of its more climate-friendly clients. The ITUC’s list, and the cases it makes, is a damning indictment of the included companies. The ITUC minces no words in calling out the seven companies for their actions. These companies deploy complex lobbying operations to undermine popular will and disrupt existing or nascent global policy that could hold them accountable. They are invariably led by ultra-wealthy individuals that support and finance far-right politicians and parties to further their own interests. When the far-right wins power, it discredits and defunds democratic global institutions; reduces taxes on the wealthy and on corporations; undercuts living wages; favours bilateral aid financing over multilateralism; and cracks down on human, trade union, and democratic rights, as evidenced by the ITUC’s Global Rights Index. If more organizations continue to shine a spotlight on the actions of the companies on the list, public perception could eventually force them to change how they do business.

Title: Amazon, ExxonMobile, Meta, Tesla, Others Labeled ‘Underminers of Democracy’

Time Published: 2024-09-24T03:47:04Z
Full Content:
A report by the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) is calling out some of the world’s biggest companies, saying they undermine democracy worldwide. The ITUC says its mission is “the promotion and defence of workers’ rights and interests, through international cooperation between trade unions, global campaigning and advocacy within the major global institutions.” Tune in: How Major U.S. Firms Got Branded as Undermining Democracy! The ITUC has published a list calling out the top seven “emblematic companies that benefit financially by continuing to violate trade union and human rights, monopolise media and technology, exacerbate climate catastrophe, and privatise public services. They represent a wider corporate world that protects and expands its own profits by undermining democracy.” The list includes: The organization then goes on to describe why each company made it on to the list. ITUC calls out Amazon for its repeated privacy violations, worker endangerment, and opposition to labor laws. The world’s largest online retailer and cloud computing service, and its fifth-largest employer, there is no industry or community Amazon and its subsidiaries have not adversely impacted. The company has become notorious for its union busting and low wages on multiple continents, monopoly in e-commerce, egregious carbon emissions through its AWS data centres, corporate tax evasion, and lobbying at national and international level. In the United States alone, where Amazon’s worker injury rate is twice as high as similar companies, the company has racked up more than US$250 million in fines for privacy, occupational health and safety, wage, and environmental violation cases filed by workers across sectors. Attempts to hold Amazon accountable to labour rights have led the company to challenge the constitutionality of the National Labor Relations Board in the U.S. In Canada, the company is trying to overturn provincial labour law. In Europe, Amazon was barred this year from lobbying within the European Parliament for its refusal to attend hearings on violations of worker rights in its warehouses, becoming only the second company in history to face such a sanction. Its refusal to negotiate with unions in Germany has resulted in a decade of strikes. In India, the company has admitted to breaching workplace safety standards in its warehouses. Blackstone Group makes the list for opposition to violations of consumer protection laws, violating employment laws, employing child labor, and harming the environment, including deforestation of the Amazon. Blackstone is well-known by climate justice advocates for its role in the rapid deforestation of the Amazon rainforest and huge investments in fossil fuel projects. In the UK, Blackstone reaped huge profits while saddling one of the country’s largest long-term care providers with insurmountable debt. Blackstone infamously profited from housing market speculation after the 2008 financial crisis and aggressively evicted workers after the Covid-19 pandemic. Blackstone and its subsidiaries have been penalised for competition, contracting, employment, financial and consumer protection violations to the tune of nearly US$300 million in one country alone. It was also the face of child labour in meatpacking, is known for its exorbitant fees to manage worker pensions, and has so far failed to sign up to a coalition-designed Private Equity Labor Rights Platform. In Brazil, it has been criticised for helping to privatise public infrastructure and corporatise agricultural land. Blackstone seems to believe that it – not voters – should determine public policy. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on housing has accused Blackstone of, “using its significant resources and political leverage to undermine domestic laws and policies that would in fact improve access to adequate housing.” ExxonMobil’s inclusion on the list should come as a surprise to no one, given the company’s long history of hiding its finding about the impact of fossil fuels on the environment. Perhaps the greatest example of Exxon’s disinterest in democratic deliberation was its corporate commitment of nearly four decades to conceal from the public its own internal evidence that climate change was real, accelerating, and driven by fossil fuel use while simultaneously financing far-right think tanks in the US and Europe to inject climate scepticism and denialism into the public discourse. While it altered its public position on climate change years ago, Exxon continues to lobby against meaningful climate policy and still promotes fossil fuel and plastics use to the detriment of communities around the world. It benefits from another entry on our list, Meta, by spreading right-wing propaganda in favour of fossil fuels. It finances the Republican Attorneys General Association, which has led efforts to pressure the US Supreme Court to throw out climate change lawsuits seeking damages from Exxon and its competitors. Glencore has a track record of flaunting the law, pleading guilty to various charges in a number of countries. The largest trader of commodities and the largest mining company in the world by revenue, Glencore controls or produces huge portions of the global supply of coal, zinc, cobalt, and other minerals, metals, fuels and foods. The company’s undermining of democracy is not in dispute, as it has in recent years pled guilty to committing bribery, corruption, and market manipulation in countries as varied as Venezuela, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Cote d’Ivoire, Nigeria, and South Sudan. The scale of Glencore’s global lobbying lays bare the organisational conviction that it, rather than the voting public, should determine policy. While it publicly shows itself to support measures such as the Paris Agreement and the UN Sustainable Development Goals, for years it has made use of right-wing consultants to spend “millions bankrolling a secret, globally coordinated campaign to prop up coal demand by undermining environmental activists, influencing politicians and spreading sophisticated pro-coal messaging on social media.” This self-serving posture is also exhibited in its efforts to undermine popular climate policy in the European Union, the United States, and South Africa. Meta’s role in politics and its ability to influence people, including its users falling victim to misinformation, has long made the company the target of critics and led to its inclusion on the list. The world’s largest social media company, Meta is the parent of Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Threads, and Messenger. Combined, these products have nearly four billion users – the same number of people estimated to be voting worldwide in 2024. The company’s scale, and its corporate behaviour, have led some to call it “a foreign state, populated by people without sovereignty, ruled by a leader with absolute power.” Meta’s algorithms can quite literally alter humanity’s perceptions of reality. Its revenue model exploits trillions of personalised data points to deliver highly effective advertising to its users. That has made it a perfect target for data breaches seized on by authoritarians and an ideal vessel for right-wing political parties to spread propaganda around the world. Violent, far-right militias in the US use Facebook to recruit new members. In Germany, the far-right AfD used Facebook to stoke anti-immigrant hatred and position itself for unprecedented success in June’s European parliamentary elections. While Tesla may be the world’s leading EV maker, that standing has come at the expense of workers rights, with the company engaging in a long history of combating unionization efforts. In Germany, Sweden, and the US, Tesla has aggressively violated the right to organise, refused to engage in collective bargaining, and provoked unprecedented strike action for its subversion of social dialogue, a pillar of industrial democracy in many European economies. Tesla’s hostility toward unions earned it a place on a list of Worst Union-Busters of 2023.

Title: BlackRock: The puppet master behind Kamala Harris

Time Published: 2024-09-24T01:00:00Z

Lifestyle by Blaze Media The only 'opportunity economy' the veep represents is the one letting Big Finance keep gutting the middle class. Kamala Harris is not a comedian, but you could be forgiven for thinking otherwise. During the recent presidential debate, the tireless TikToker somehow managed to maintain a straight face while pledging to create an "opportunity economy" for the middle class. Yet, this promise rings hollow when both she and President Biden are deeply entangled with BlackRock, a firm notorious for crushing the very group she claims to uplift. BlackRock’s CEO, Larry Fink, openly praises the efficiency of totalitarian regimes; what does this say about where the firm’s loyalties lie? In short, BlackRock has used its vast financial influence to sway political decisions, control market outcomes, and prioritize profits over the interests of everyday people. It's the puppet master behind the scenes, shaping policies that favor the elite while leaving the middle class to foot the bill. Harris' cozy relationship with BlackRock exposes her "opportunity economy" as nothing more than a smokescreen for serving the powerful. The facts speak for themselves. Harris' two top economic advisers, Michael Pyle and Brian Deese, were key players at BlackRock. Both weredrafted last month, likely to help her craft policies in anticipation of a potential presidency. As for Joe Biden, since taking office, he has surrounded himself with former BlackRock executives, embedding the financial giant's influence at the highest levels of government. Take Michael Pyle, once BlackRock’s global chief investment strategist, who recently served as U.S. deputy national security adviser for international economics. In this critical role, Pyle directed the administration's international economic policy and acted as Biden’s key representative, or “sherpa,” at the G7 and G20 summits. His sway over global economic strategy was significant. Before this, Pyle helped shape domestic policy as Harris’ chief economic adviser during the administration's disastrous first year. His deep ties to BlackRock underscore the firm’s growing grip on the Biden administration's decision-making, further aligning government policy with Wall Street’s interests. Last week BlackRock announced that it was rehiring Pyle as deputy head of it's $3.2 trillion portfolio management group. And let’s not forget Adewale "Wally" Adeyemo, another key player in the Biden administration. Currently serving as deputy secretary of the treasury, the 43-year-old was once Larry Fink'sright-hand man at BlackRock. During his time at the investment giant, Adeyemo acted as a senior adviser and led the firm's public policy team, directly shaping BlackRock’s strategy in navigating government relations and regulatory frameworks. His current role places him in a powerful position to influence U.S. financial policy. Then there's Eric Van Nostrand, a former BlackRock executive now serving as a senior adviser under Biden on economic issues related to Russia and Ukraine,as reported by Bloomberg. Since Van Nostrand’s appointment, BlackRock’s interest and involvement in Ukraine have suspiciously intensified, with the firm advising on reconstruction efforts and channeling investment into critical sectors. BlackRock's history suggests this support is far from altruistic. The firm has a notorious track record of capitalizing on geopolitical crises for financial gain, rather than genuinely aiding nations in need. Much like itsexploitative role during the 2008 financial crisis, when BlackRock profited from the collapse it helped precipitate, the firm now stands to benefit from Ukraine’s instability. Its influence over Kyiv’s policies, including the deregulation of urban planning, paves the way for corporate interests to exploit a rather dire situation. It doesn’t stop at Ukraine. BlackRock isn’t just funding the destabilization of democracies abroad — it’s actively helping China, a regime that poses an existential threat to American interests. The Coalition for a Prosperous America has revealed how BlackRock funnels billions into Chinese companies, many linked to the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army. This raises alarming questions about national security and America’s economic sovereignty. BlackRock’s CEO, Larry Fink, openly praises the efficiency of totalitarian regimes; what does this say about where the firm’s loyalties lie? Certainly not with the average American family struggling to make ends meet. As if that weren't enough, BlackRock’s involvement in the U.S. military-industrial complex adds another layer to its nefarious influence. As highlighted by researchers at Corporate Accountability, an organization committed to exposing corporations that undermine democracy, BlackRock holds tens of billions in investments in major defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, and Boeing. By profiting directly from never-ending wars, BlackRock reaps enormous financial rewards while American taxpayers are left to foot the bill. Which brings us back to Kamala Harris. For all her posturing, the flip-flopper-in-chief is not here to challenge this system. She’s here to safeguard it. If elected, Harris' economic policies will be molded by the same firm responsible for widening income inequality and eroding democracy. The Wall Street Journal has shed light on how BlackRock has amassed entire residential neighborhoods, turning these homes into rental properties. This aggressive acquisition strategy fuels bidding wars and drives up home prices, directly disadvantaging the middle class. As Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a Yale professor, has pointed out, Kamala Harris’ ties to Wall Street are even more intimate than Biden’s. And when Wall Street speaks, it’s really BlackRock’s voice you’re hearing. Harris’ campaign promises to support the middle class appear to be nothing more than a boldfaced lie. But this is what she excels at: bending the truth. Make no mistake about it: BlackRock’s interests are diametrically opposed to those of the American people. A Harris presidency would mean more policies that enrich the few at the expense of the many. Kamala Harris isn’t the answer; on the contrary, she’s part of the problem. John Mac Ghlionn

“He can't [negotiate] because he's owned by the West, by Washington, by London, by BlackRock, by the military industrial complex, so they're not gonna let him do that,” he continued. “They are making money out of this war and getting everything they can out of Ukraine and out of the resources that Ukraine has. So he has no other possibility. He could have stopped it as soon as he became the president in 2019.” “I fled this war because I was against this war and my government – the regime, the Kiev Nazi regime – tried to kill me for fighting for peace,” he continued. “A lot of Ukrainians who fled this war, they fled it because… they just don't want to fight, but they want to continue this war so they have the pride of Ukraine winning, and that is it. They don't understand the consequences. The consequences are a World War III situation. Ukraine cannot win this, and Ukraine already has lost when the war started, day one.”

Title: Former Merkel rival aims to become chancellor
URL: https://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/2871017/former-merkel-rival-aims-to-become-chancellor
Time Published: 2024-09-23T21:00:00Z
Full Content:
Squeezed out of top-level politics by his arch-party rival Angela Merkel more than two decades ago, Friedrich Merz is on course to land his first-ever government job as Germany's next chancellor. The conservative Christian Democrat Party (CDU) and its Bavarian sister party, which together are topping nationwide polls, last Tuesday agreed to nominate Mr Merz, 68, as candidate for chancellor in next year's federal election. A wealthy corporate lawyer who took a long hiatus from politics after losing a power struggle within the CDU to Ms Merkel in 2002, Mr Merz is widely considered a polar opposite in both style and policy to the woman who led Germany for 16 years. Where Ms Merkel was a consensus-driven, even-tempered pragmatist who shifted the CDU more towards the centre, Mr Merz is a brash and provocative economic liberal who advocates for a revival of Christian values and has pulled it back to the right since being elected CDU chief almost three years ago. He has been heard railing in recent months against Berlin's handling of migration -- marked by Ms Merkel's own open-door policy -- calling instead for asylum seekers to be turned away at German land borders. A Catholic father-of-three, married to a judge, Mr Merz hopes to win back voters from the anti-migrant Alternative for Germany (AfD), which this month became the first far-right party to win a state election since World War II. In the process, though, he has made a series of populist statements -- such as accusing some Ukrainian refugees of "social welfare tourism" and the children of some Muslim immigrants of being "small pashas" with no respect for authority -- that CDU insiders fear could alienate more centrist voters. The conservative premier of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous state, Hendrik Wuest, once considered a rival for the chancellor candidacy, earlier this year warned in a newspaper column the CDU should stick to Ms Merkel's "policies of modernity" rather than "scoring cheap points". In what his critics call a sign of his thin skin, Mr Merz, who towers over his opponents at nearly 2 metres tall, made an unusual public dig at Mr Wuest in response. "He is sensitive and quickly vexed, especially when he feels unjustly treated," said Jutta Falke-Ischinger, co-author of an unofficial biography on Mr Merz titled The Unyielding One. "He doesn't have much impulse control." However, Falke-Ischinger said Mr Merz was more decisive than current Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who is accused of dithering by his opponents. "He [Mr Merz] has an open ear for everything and everyone, is reliable; once he says something, he does it," she said. Mr Merz, a protégé of the late CDU grandee Wolfgang Schaeuble, clinched the job as party chief by dint of persistence and by appealing to grass-roots members frustrated with what they viewed as Ms Merkel's sellout of its core principles, said Alexander Clarkson, a lecturer for German studies at King's College London. "But he does not have much deep support in the party and is one blunder away from coming under enormous internal pressure," he said. The conservatives, which scored their worst-ever result in the 2021 election, have since risen in polls to about 33%, although analysts say that is relatively modest given the unpopularity of Mr Scholz's fractious coalition. Mr Merz, like Mr Scholz, has long languished in politician popularity rankings although his star has risen slightly of late. "He lacks popularity, but maybe you don't need that in these times, but rather you need to show strength -- which he does," said a high-ranking CDU politician, speaking on condition of anonymity. Mr Merz, who grew up in a small western town as the eldest son of a judge, was pushed out of his role as CDU parliamentary leader by Ms Merkel in 2002 and left the Bundestag in 2009 in order to pursue a successful business career. The amateur pilot, who disclosed in 2018 that he was earning about €1 million (36.7 million baht) a year, has worked on the advisory and supervisory boards of several major companies, from Commerzbank to BASF. He was also chairman of the German arm of BlackRock, the world's biggest fund manager. Critics accuse him of being out of touch with ordinary Germans and prone to representing the interests of corporate elites over the people. His decision to fly a private plane to the wedding of Finance Minister Christian Lindner in 2022 in a country wary of ostentation sparked controversy. Supporters say his private sector experience can help him better understand how to reboot a stagnant economy. Mr Merz, the author of the 2008 book Dare More Capitalism, has said he wants to reduce social benefits and taxes, particularly on companies. He also wants to simplify Germany's notoriously complex tax system; annual tax returns should be so simple you could write them on a beer mat, he once said. The government should create more competitive conditions for all firms for example by lowering energy prices and foster innovation rather than certain sectors like e-mobility, according to Mr Merz, who long opposed Germany's exit from nuclear power. Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING Research, said the main problem with the proposals was that Mr Merz had not spelt out how he would finance them. "Merz's economic policy proposals all make sense but are typical opposition proposals and not yet constructive ideas for a next government," he said. Mr Merz's fiscal conservatism, in particular his opposition to common European debt, could also put the brakes on ideas to boost EU growth, for example through higher public investment. Still, Mr Merz, who started his political career as a European lawmaker, has described himself as a "a truly convinced European" and advocated for a closer union, in particular on defence and foreign policy. This and his more hawkish stance on both Russia and China arguably make him more aligned with French President Emmanuel Macron, whom he visited in Paris late last year, than Mr Scholz is, according to Eurasia Group. British World War II leader Winston Churchill is the politician who has marked him most, he says, other than Schaueble. Mr Merz has also described himself as "a convinced transatlanticist", chairing the "Atlantic Bridge", a non-profit fostering US-German ties, for 10 years. His ability to put into place any of his ideas will depend in part on his ability to form a coalition with the very three ruling parties he has now spent years attacking, given he -- like all leaders of mainstream parties -- has ruled out working with the AfD. "As chancellor, he might cater to that growing desire for politicians with clear convictions after the Merkel and Scholz years," said Carsten Nickel at political risk consultancy Teneo. "But German politics is all about compromise in the end, and that might be something that comes less naturally to Merz." Reuters Sarah Marsh is chief correspondent for political coverage for Reuters in Berlin.

Southwest Airlines will host a blockbuster event in Dallas this week, to unveil a service most other carriers began offering decades ago. At its annual Investor Day, Southwest will showcase its first-ever plan for assigning passengers to specific airplane seats, including premium-priced larger ones that will require altering the layouts of the company’s previously egalitarian cabins. Selling a variety of seating options at different price points has long been the practice at Fort Worth–based American Airlines—and at Delta, and United, and most other major carriers around the world. Yet some insiders think Southwest will treat the announcement with the sort of fanfare that accompanied Apple’s introduction of the first iPhone—framing it as a this-changes-everything moment for the company. Even if Southwest CEO Bob Jordan doesn’t don Steve Jobs’s trademark black mock turtleneck, the event will mark a pivotal point in the airline’s 53-year history. That’s because among the shareholders watching carefully will be those at Elliott Investment Management, a so-called activist investment firm led by New York City billionaire Paul Singer. If Elliott doesn’t agree that Thursday’s announcements will deliver a quick enough boost to Southwest’s stock price, it will likely turn up the volume of its calls for heads to roll at the airline—including Jordan’s. That Elliott is in a position to force anyone out of Southwest’s C-suite confirms that things have already changed dramatically at the company. Particularly under its famed cofounder and CEO, the late Herb Kelleher, the airline has fiercely defended its independence, including its maverick business practices, such as open seating. But as the airline has struggled in recent years—not least with hugely disruptive delays and cancellations caused by decades of underinvestment in digital technology—Elliott has gained considerable influence over its future. On June 10, Elliott announced it had acquired a big stake in Southwest, and it now says it holds 11 percent of the airline’s 599 million outstanding shares—enough to call for a special meeting at which it could, with the backing of a majority of other shareholders, force out some or all of Southwest’s board members and, by extension, Jordan. Elliott, which declined to make an executive available to Texas Monthly for an interview, has yet to call for such a meeting. Southwest, whose executives also declined our interview requests, tried to fend off Elliott’s attack earlier this month by offering to have six of its board members resign and to shrink its board from fifteen directors to twelve by next year. During a meeting at Elliott’s offices in New York City, Gary Kelly, Southwest’s executive board chairman and former longtime CEO, also said he’d retire by May. Elliott trumpeted that appeasement offer as unprecedented. But two days after receiving it, the firm’s representatives made clear to leaders of the union that represents the airline’s mechanics that it wasn’t enough. In a subsequent memo to union members, Bret Oestreich, president of the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association, wrote that Elliott wants Kelly out before next spring. Elliot’s “vision of a Southwest turnaround is one where Robert Jordan does not remain as CEO,” Oestreich added. “If Elliott can assert enough Board influence, other top executives would also, most likely, be replaced.” Jordan has indicated he’s not ready to step down, nor is he inclined to dismiss other executives. Back in August, he wrote to employees that the standoff with Elliott was “a battle for the heart of our company and our future—your future.” The word “heart” was no doubt carefully chosen by a company that once dubbed itself “the love airline,” is headquartered at Love Field, chose LUV for its stock ticker symbol, and paints a giant heart on the belly of each of its planes. On Thursday, Jordan will have the chance to woo Southwest’s other shareholders, the vast majority of which are institutional investors, such as the Vanguard Group and BlackRock. Such investors tend to demonstrate more patience than do “activist” funds such as Elliott, which typically press for actions that would quickly boost the stock price and are often skeptical of executives who wish to make longer-term investments in their businesses. Indeed, one analyst, Sheila Kahyaoglu, a managing director at New York investment bank Jefferies, has said she expects that most Southwest shareholders are unlikely to vote Jordan out without first “entertaining a go-forward plan.” Jordan will have the chance this week to make his case. At Investor Day, he may tout the multiple ways in which he has expensively upgraded the technology Southwest uses to position its planes and flight crews where they’re needed around the country. He could cite his securing of multiple new contracts with all of Southwest’s unionized workers and, now, the addition of premium-seating fees and red-eye flights. Could he add a Steve Jobs–style “one more thing”? Might Southwest end its “bags fly free” policy, since Elliott has called bag fees one of the “key commercial innovations” that Southwest has “written off”? Investors and analysts are eager to find out. Whatever’s in the works, for an airline that has cultivated an irreverent, fun-loving brand reputation, the stakes are seriously high. What would it mean to run Southwest Airlines to Elliott’s liking? The firm offers a snapshot of its vision through a website it created called Stronger Southwest. Solutions include replacing a slew of executives and board directors with outsiders who would turn Southwest into an airline more like American, Delta, and United—with the same checked-bag fees and even more basic economy and premium seating options than Jordan may propose on Thursday. In materials posted to the Stronger Southwest site, Elliott lists multiple executives it might seek to replace. They include Kelly, who has worked for Southwest for 38 years, and Jordan, whose tenure is 36 years, as well as chief financial officer Tammy Romo (33 years) and chief administrative officer Linda Rutherford (32 years). Each of them represents a direct link to airline cofounder Kelleher and former company president Colleen Barrett, who together built Southwest from a tiny Texas-only operation that started flying in 1971 into an airline that today carries more passengers domestically than any other in the U.S. and whose market value was, as recently as 2008, greater than those of the six other major U.S. airlines combined. In past conversations I’ve had with Jordan, Kelly, Romo, Rutherford, and Kelleher (who died in 2019), the long tenure of Southwest’s leadership was considered a strength at the company—cited as key to Southwest’s famously familial corporate culture. Cheryl Hughey, the airline’s senior adviser for culture and engagement, who began working at Southwest in 1980 as a reservation agent, once told me, “It is very important to know your heritage and how the foundation [of the company] was formed. That’s what families do.” Elliot’s Stronger Southwest site doesn’t mention family or corporate culture. But it does quote Kelleher: “If you don’t change, you die. . . . If things change faster outside your company than they change inside your company, you’ve got something to worry about.” That quote, taken from a 2014 conversation between Gary Kelly and Kelleher that’s discussed on Kelly’s own LinkedIn page, must read like nails on a chalkboard to Southwest’s traditionalist insiders. Elliott’s Stronger Southwest site makes no mention of Kelleher’s pronouncements that the airline primarily exists to serve its employees—not its shareholders. Kelleher’s mantra was that if the company takes care of its people, the people will take care of the customers, whose loyal patronage will benefit the shareholders. Elliott might argue, though, that Southwest isn’t caring for its people as well as it once did. Materials on the Stronger Southwest site note a “massive decline in annual profit sharing pay for employees” in recent years. Southwest’s annual profits were 57 percent lower in 2023 than in 2019, even as revenue was 16 percent higher. As a result, the average Southwest employee has seen annual profit sharing decline by more than $9,600 since 2019, according to Elliott. Critics have labeled Elliott a “vulture fund” because of its history of buying distressed bonds of countries on the brink of going broke. Its founder, Singer, famously waged a fourteen-year-long global legal battle to collect on debts owed by the nation of Argentina. The battle nearly erupted in violence when Elliott obtained a court order to seize a three-hundred-foot Argentine naval ship while it was moored off the West African nation of Ghana. Crew members drew their weapons on a man who attempted to board the ship. Calmer heads prevailed, but in the end, Argentina ponied up $2.4 billion to Elliott. The New Yorker reported that that amount represented a 1,270 percent return on Elliott’s initial investment. Elliott isn’t expecting quite so eye-popping a return on its Southwest investment. If the airline is managed as Elliott would prefer, according to Stronger Southwest, its share price should reach $49, although Elliott doesn’t say how quickly that could happen. Such an increase would yield more than $1.2 billion for the firm. If Southwest hopes to keep its adversarial investor from forcing it to become more like American and Delta and United—which, by the way, haven’t exactly delighted investors over the past decade—it might look to its past for guidance. Kelleher once told me, during a conversation in his windowless office at Southwest’s old Love Field headquarters, that he spent years parrying with Wall Street. “I would go to New York in the early eighties,” he said, “and the investment community would tell me that they thought Southwest Airlines was going to have a very short future unless we changed to emulate what the airlines had traditionally done.” Kelleher resisted such calls, and as Southwest continued growing and posted rising profits, eventually Wall Street relented. But that only came after a few tense encounters, including one with an investment banker that I first read about in Thomas Petzinger Jr.’s 1996 book, Hard Landing. During an interview with Kelleher two decades ago, I asked him to confirm that confrontation, which had occurred in the same office where we were sitting. Kelleher, who loved to put on a show, was more than happy to reenact what occurred. He set a Merit Ultra cigarette down in an ashtray and leaped from his blue leather chair, telling me that the banker said Southwest seemed like the perfect target for a hostile takeover. Kelleher wasn’t about to let Southwest get gobbled up by some bigger competitor—be it crosstown rival American Airlines or someone else. In recounting the story, he walked over, put his hands on my shoulders, and showed me how he’d slowly lifted the investment banker out of his seat. At over six feet, Kelleher, a former high school basketball star, could be physically imposing, and his baritone voice could sound downright scary when he got serious, which he had been with the banker. As he backed the man up against a wall and poked him in the chest, “the guy turned white as a sheet,” Kelleher told me. Kelleher explained to the banker that if any company tried to take over Southwest, he would do anything necessary to stop it. “I will even burn this company to the ground if I have to,” he said. The shocked banker ran out the door, passing through the adjoining office of Colleen Barrett (who died earlier this year). Barrett rushed in to ask Kelleher what had happened. He replied: “I just delivered a message to Wall Street.” Up until the COVID-19 pandemic, Wall Street heeded that message. Southwest still boasts a strong claim to being what it calls “the most successful commercial carrier in the history of aviation.” After its founding, the airline posted 47 consecutive years of profits, running from 1973 until COVID wrecked the travel industry, in 2020. Unlike American or Delta or United or most major U.S. carriers, Southwest has never declared bankruptcy. Postpandemic, Southwest, like other airlines, has faced serious operational headwinds. Some of its problems have been worse than those of its peers, such as its holiday season meltdown in 2022. Southwest has remained profitable, but its stock is down about 1 percent since May 2023, while United’s and Delta’s are up about 17 percent and 39 percent, respectively. (American is down 21 percent.) Elliott thinks Southwest can deliver shareholders a big short-term gain by becoming more like its rivals, the very thing Kelleher fought off all those decades ago. At Investor Day, we stand to find out whether the airline will comply or whether it’s about to deliver another defiant message to Wall Street.

Title: Feminism, Debt and Organizing Against Argentina’s Far Right
URL: https://inthesetimes.com/article/feminism-debt-argentina-far-right-milei-organizing
Time Published: 2024-09-23T18:27:00Z
Full Content:
BUENOS AIRES — As part of the Ni Una Menos (Not One Less) Collective in Argentina, we have been organizing feminist strikes and actions against the far Right’s austerity plan and its attacks on the rights of women and LGBTQI+ communities. We hope to offer an analysis from a feminist perspective that our movements can apply in the fight against debt under the new, far-right administration of President Javier Milei. Milei assumed office in late 2023 promising deregulation and ​“chainsaw cuts” and quickly began ushering in a slew of austerity measures that have targeted a spectrum of public services, including universities. He also closed Argentina’s anti-discrimination agency and the ministry that handles women’s affairs. We have been developing strategies for collective organizing against debt and the financial colonization of everyday life. This analysis is somewhat novel in Argentina, and we find it fundamental to understanding this moment of Milei’s ascendance. For the first time in our history, the Argentine state spends more on debt payments than pension payments. Under Milei, household debt has also intensified alongside the deregulation of prices for basic goods and services. In researching our book, A Feminist Reading of Debt, we found a large number of women were in debt from purchasing those types of goods and services needed for social reproduction (such as taking care of families and repairing homes, among many others) — a situation exacerbated by Argentina’s agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 2018. We call this ​“indebtedness to survive.” Alongside intellectuals like Silvia Federici, we think about the financial colonization of social reproduction as the invasion of finance into increasingly broader areas of life. That’s the context in which we approach the inherent antagonism of the term ​“financial caste.” We use the term in a very precise sense, which must be contrasted with how Milei and his libertarian political force have popularized the use of the word ​“caste.” They use this (and other terms) to present themselves as ​“outsiders,” signaling the political class as the cause of the problems that working people in Argentina face, which excludes the directors of major corporations and financial elites and institutions (banks, the IMF, investment fund managers, businessmen tied to digital finance) that benefit from crises in the Argentine economy. We refuse to let Milei hide his close ties with financial powers and corporations, which he obfuscates by redefining the language of his capitalist conservatism. We are forced to underscore the true meaning of ​“caste” for him and mark a concrete antagonism between the feminist struggle and those who try to profit from financial speculation at the expense of our bodies and spaces. We have outlined some of the lessons we have learned through our processes of resistance to the neoliberal shock policies applied by the extreme right — and we hope they can fuel others in their fights against far-right leaders devoted to corporations and the suppression of women and the working class. 1. For Milei, to govern is to destroy, create chaos and exercise cruelty The two novel characteristics of the neoliberal shockwave we are living through are its speed and violence. Milei derives his power from his links with hedge funds (like BlackRock) and powerful, extractivist corporations and the ultrawealthy (hence his frequent visits with Elon Musk). These deep ties are appearing as Argentine society is being reconfigured by new extremes of capitalism toward an extractive, warlike model. This system of governance is sustained through three vectors: the capacity for destruction (mass firings, elimination of entire state organs, destruction of social ties fostered by community groups); the creation of chaos (neoliberal shock politics and the imposition of new policies and norms, some of them unconstitutional); and the deployment of cruelty (withholding food from the poorest — and taking pride in it). None of it is about excesses or inadequacies but is a form of politics necessary to foster crisis and war. 2. We need to center decolonization There’s not much use arguing whether Milei is a symptom of the local impact of a global phenomenon, or an extreme national idiosyncrasy. So to better understand what is actually happening, we must consider what is new about Milei and to what degree his entrenchment in Argentine politics and society is not particular to national specificities and personal eccentricities. The impact of Milei’s far-right government, for example, exceeds former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro’s — because the crisis of the genocide in Gaza and the alignment of the United States and Israel have permitted Milei to approach the genocide on his own terms. But Milei too can be differentiated from the exponents of the far right of the Global North, like former U.S. President Donald Trump, because Milei does not operate with nationalism as the engine driving his regime. Instead, Milei’s project is neocolonial, from which he draws his power and effectiveness. As we have previously argued, neoliberalism in our region is inherently violent from its origins. The military dictatorship of 1976 — the moment at which the neoliberal model was applied — cannot be understood separate from the massive repression of popular uprisings. This authoritarianism is not an a posteriori deviation, and in that same way, the violence stemming from neoliberalism in Argentina is tied to processes of recolonization. We are now witnessing a new phase of that recolonization, which can be called ​“financial colonization” (including IMF austerity programs in various countries and the increasing presence of hedge funds targeting natural resources) and ​“military colonization” (as in the case of many Latin American countries, like Ecuador and Haiti, where the possibility of an internal war makes way for colonial domination). There is talk in Argentina of a form of national dissolution that would segment the country into sacrifice zones (with entire provinces linked to the activity of extractivist corporations), so centralizing the need for decolonization (by opposing vocabulary, terminology and practices) becomes a critical tactic. 3. Building power and redefining violence Feminists often think about the intersections of war to identify the emerging coordinates of violence. The war against the conditions of social reproduction (withholding food, liberalization of the prices of fundamental goods and services, freezing salaries) — as well as the war against the conditions for the reproduction of struggle (the economic crisis and debt that makes organizing and demonstrating nearly impossible) — is articulated with war as the global stage, meaning the far right can appeal to residents by polarizing localities that protest. Militarization is the highest stage of financial warfare, which is appearing in Ecuador, Haiti and Argentina (among others) in conditions somewhat similar to circumstances in Africa in the 1980s. Federici, using this perspective, highlights the necessity of generating a feminist antiwar movement to resist this militarization and financial warfare As militant activists and organizers ourselves, we have been obligated to rethink how we categorize and define violence. We have long been saying that violence fueled by toxic masculinity is incomprehensible without being embedded within a system of ​“economic violence,” which has transformed and intensified into ​“financial violence,” which (to invoke Étienne Balibar’s formulation) conforms to capitalism’s aim to become ​“absolute.” 4. Argentina is a laboratory for the rest of the world Milei’s far right is trying to channel a neoliberalism in crisis into relaunching a neo-extractivist project and agenda in the global market, particularly surrounding energy and lithium. One new development is that Milei’s government is not willing to make concessions in the face of increased social conflict. To affirm that Milei’s regime has fascist elements is not to say the majority of his voters are fascists. In fact, a great deal of his support can be explained through everyday economics. It’s a terrain that seems to be disregarded time and again in its inexorable materiality and, as such, in its political rationality. In the feminist movement, we have situated this link between fascism and everyday economics as a fundamental perspective to comprehend the economic violence endured by those who sustain the domestic economy, who go into debt just to survive while hearing from Milei that ​“there is no money” or ​“we’ll need to make sacrifices.” It presents our greatest challenge as anti-debt militants: How do we do politics when the language of austerity becomes the popular language? 5. The streets are a vital space The feminist marches that saw participation from hundreds of thousands of women in cities across Latin America on March 8 (International Women’s Day), including tens of thousands in Buenos Aires, were remarkable for several reasons. We used them against a far-right government that has publicly declared us to be the enemy, has defunded the right to abortion and has campaigned publicly with racist and misogynistic discourse. We organized in spite of the repressive protocol that criminalizes protest, which made self-care essential. And it was all in the midst of Milei’s government waging an economic war against the Argentine population, which makes organizing and mobilizing a huge undertaking. The greatest beneficiary of these neoliberal shock policies is the financial caste. The policies are enacted with the idea that feminized bodies, in ever more precarious conditions, will take on more work to sustain life. We will fight back through feminism of the people.

Title: AI Chip Maker Alphawave Sees Stock Tumble On Revenue Drop

Alphawave Semi was valued at £3 billion ($4 billion) when it debuted on the London Stock Exchange in ... [+] May 2021. Photographer: Tiffany Hagler-Geard/Bloomberg Alphawave Semi surprised investors this morning when the semiconductor company released interim earnings results that sent its London-traded shares tumbling by as much as 43% before paring the losses to finish the day down by 14%. Alphawave’s leadership said on Monday that it had to cut its revenue forecast for 2024, but still expects to hit its targets from next year onward. The chip designer said it now expects to generate revenue of $310 to $330 million in 2024, down from the $345 to $365 million it had projected earlier. Alphawave blamed the change in its outlook on the merger of two large AI customers in Korea as well as the timing of tape-outs in the second half of the year. Tape-outs occur when Alphawave has completed its work and transfers the finalized design of a semiconductor device to chip foundries for fabrication. The Canadian company does not actually manufacture the chips. Instead, Alphawave focuses on developing the technology within semiconductors that allows them to transmit data more rapidly for use in artificial intelligence. “Another guidance cut isn't helpful but the important part for us, we believe, is the underlying business remains strong and visibility on 2025 is improving, aided by Alphawave being exposed to the best end market in semis–AI,” Barclays analyst Simon Coles said in a note to clients. Barclays maintained an overweight rating on Alphawave’s shares, but lowered its price target to 190 pence from 195. The company’s shares closed Monday at 107.8 pence. “Our OW [overweight] is predicated on the fact that Alphawave only needs to take a little market share to see material growth in the coming years given the growth expected in its end markets,” Coles added. Alphawave’s filing on Monday showed that its revenue had been halved in the first half of the year to $91 million. The company also reported an adjusted net loss before depreciation, interest and taxes of $11.8 million, after booking a profit of $32.4 million in the same period last year. “We expect revenue and adjusted Ebitda in the second half to increase significantly over the first half as our high-quality design wins from last year tape-out and convert into revenue,” John Lofton Holt, executive chairman of Alphawave, said in its filing. Alphawave first debuted on the London Stock Exchange in May 2021 with a listing price of 410 pence and the backing of blue-chip asset managers BlackRock and Janus Henderson. In late 2021, the Financial Times raised questions over whether it had properly disclosed related-party transactions. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

September 23, 2024 13:57 ET | Source: Force For Good Force For Good LONDON, Sept. 23, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Force For Good: The world is failing to meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and urgent action is needed to unlock progress and overcome the growing annual SDG funding gap, which now stands at US$14-17 trillion, a new report from Force for Good finds, US$112-136 trillion in total, up 10%, due to the costs of global climate transition and development needs in the Global South. Today, only 16% of the goal’s 169 underlying targets are on track to be met by 2030, with 50% falling behind, and 30% regressing below their 2015 levels when the SDGs were kicked off, the report finds. Nine ‘Big Ideas’, including climate transition frameworks, AI-enabled connectivity, and universal digital financial services, if scaled globally, have the cumulative potential to progress SDG achievement to nearly 90%, from less than 66% today, reigniting exponential progress. “This report shows how the global order and the systems itself can be transformed by delivering solutions en masse across the planet, engaging everyone in this endeavour ... By leveraging the strengths of governments, private companies, NGOS and mobilising the individual as an agent of change, we can create a sustainable, secure, and prosperous future,” said Ketan Patel, Chair of the Advisory Council. The world’s failure to meet the goals is being driven by a series of interrelated economic, political, geopolitical and environmental shocks - including the COVID-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine and Gaza, the energy, cost-of-living and climate crises – interacting with one another to create a ‘polycrisis’ that is diverting attention and resources away from sustainable development. A mass and fast roll out of the ‘Nine Big Ideas’, sponsored by appropriate champions across government, private sector or multi-lateral institutions, working with the United Nations, can make a transformative impact on developing countries, while benefitting the global economy. While the mass mobilisation of solutions will take a global effort, the largest developing countries, particularly India, China, and Brazil, account for two-thirds of the world’s sustainable development potential. These countries represent the first wave of opportunity in a multi-wave project to realize the future faster. Meeting the SDGs is a crucial step for the world in the transition to the next era of human civilization, building a platform on which further breakthroughs and technologies can create a sustainable, secure and superior future. About Force for Good Force for Good's mission is to mobilize capital, resources, and ideas as a force for good in the world at a time of profound change. The organization's Capital as a Force for Good Initiative engages the world's leading financial institutions and other stakeholders, to promote sustainable development through the deployment of capital and solutions to address global issues and enable the transition to a better future.

ROME (Reuters) -Italy has approved BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), the world's biggest asset manager, holding a stake of more than 3% in Italian defence and aerospace group Leonardo, a document seen by Reuters showed on Monday. The document, sent by Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's office to parliament, deals with so-called "golden power" decisions. Rome has "golden powers" to block or set conditions on foreign and domestic investments, as well as governance changes, involving companies that operate in strategic sectors such as energy, telecoms, defence and banking. "I am happy for the interest of BlackRock. It is an important recognition," Leonardo chief executive Roberto Cingolani told Reuters. The cabinet granted the authorisation to BlackRock on Sept. 18 while also imposing some unspecified conditions, according to the document. Under Italian legislation, Meloni's office must approve share ownership in any strategic firm which is also listed on the Milan stock exchange when the stake crosses thresholds set at 3%, 5%, 10%, and various other intervals up to 50%. However, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters BlackRock was expected to trim its stake in a short time, as Leonardo's bylaws stipulate that no investor outside the public administration can own more than 3% of capital. Italy's economy ministry owns 30.2% of Leonardo, the country's leading defence group as well as a manufacturer of satellites and orbiting infrastructure. BlackRock is also a leading investor in Italy's financial sector, holding 7% of UniCredit and 5% of Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY), the country's top two banks.

The pension giant also committed another $1 billion to a BlackRock climate fund after dumping nearly $4 billion in public equities earlier this year. The New York State Common Retirement Fund cashed out of three multi-asset strategic partnerships worth more than $3 billion during July, according to its latest monthly transaction report. The $268 billion pension fund also committed $1 billion to a BlackRock climate change fund, marking the second straight month it invested in public equities after terminating a combined $3.8 billion worth of equity funds in March and April. The NYSCRF ended a Schroder Investment Management multi-asset fund within its multi-asset strategic partnership portfolio that was worth approximately $1.2 billion, which was allocated to cash. It also terminated multi-asset funds managed by Morgan Stanley Investment Management and Wellington Management, respectively, which were worth $1.1 billion each and were also allocated to cash. Within its public equities portfolio, the pension fund doubled its investment in BlackRock’s MSCI Climate Change Index to $2 billion. The commitment follows an initial $1 billion investment in January 2023. The fund tracks an index that measures opportunities and risks associated with the transition to a low-carbon economy. It was up 31% in 2023 and 15% annually over five years. Never miss a story — sign up for CIO newsletters to stay up-to-date on the latest institutional investment industry news.  The pension fund earmarked nearly $800 million within its real estate portfolio during July, $300 million of which is going to the BentallGreenOak Asia IV fund, a closed-end, pan-Asian fund managed by real estate investment firm BentallGreenOak. Another $200 million will be invested in Oaktree Capital Management’s Oaktree Real Estate Opportunities Fund IX, described as a broad-based opportunistic real estate fund. The NYSCRF also committed $150 million to the KKR Real Estate Partners Americas IV Co-Investment fund managed by KKR & Co. Inc. The fund co-invests with KKR Real Estate Partners Americas IV fund and is sponsored by KKR. In addition to the real-estate fund investments, the pension fund also bought a few properties during July. Its largest such acquisition was Building B at The Cubes at Glendale, an Arizona industrial park, for $128.1 million. The NYSCRF also paid slightly less than $1.6 million to buy a complex in Otsego, New York, that includes one building with 64 residential units and one commercial space. The pension fund paid slightly less than $1.1 million for a three-story building with eight residential units in Dutchess County, New York. Within its private equity portfolio, the NYSCRF committed $400 million to the Kohlberg Empire State Co-Investment Fund, managed by Kohlberg & Co. The fund will invest additional capital with the Kohlberg NY Investors X-B fund, mainly in the U.S. It is also investing $300 million to the Kohlberg NY Investors X-B fund, also managed by Kohlberg & Co. The fund will seek investments in pharmaceutical and medical products and services; infrastructure services; business services; financial and information services; health care services; and the food and consumer sectors. The pension fund also earmarked $250 million within its real assets portfolio to the Hull Street Energy Partners III fund, which mainly invests in power generation assets involved in energy transition. As part of the NYSCRF’s emerging manager program, which invests with newer, smaller and diverse investment management firms, the pension fund has set aside $15.7 million for the Valspring Capital Fund I within its private equity asset class. The fund aims to make growth equity investments in U.S.-based, tech-enabled health care and health care services companies.

As Saba Capital Management increases its stake in BlackRock Health Sciences Term Trust (BMEZ), investors are evaluating the trust's recent performance and financial metrics. According to InvestingPro data, BMEZ boasts a market capitalization of approximately $1.7 billion, with a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 25.31, reflecting the market's valuation of the company relative to its earnings. One of the standout InvestingPro Tips for BMEZ is its significant dividend yield, which currently stands at an impressive 13.19%, as of the last dividend with an ex-date of September 16, 2024. This yield is particularly attractive to income-focused investors who are looking for steady cash flows from their investments. In contrast, a point of concern may be the weak gross profit margins, which could indicate challenges in maintaining profitability relative to sales. Additionally, the valuation implies a poor free cash flow yield, suggesting that the price investors are willing to pay for each dollar of free cash flows is relatively high. Despite these concerns, BMEZ has been trading near its 52-week high, with the price being 96.26% of the peak, indicating strong investor confidence and a potentially bullish outlook among market participants. The trust has also experienced positive total returns across various time frames, with a year-to-date price total return of 17.71% and a one-year price total return of 24.4%.

Title: Northvolt to axe 1,600 jobs as Europe's EV hopes stall
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/northvolt-to-axe-1600-jobs-as-europes-ev-hopes-stall-3627890
Time Published: 2024-09-23T14:45:47Z
Full Content:
By Marie Mannes STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Northvolt plans to cut 1,600 jobs at its base in Sweden, or about a fifth of its global workforce, as Europe's biggest hope in the electric vehicle battery market struggles with production problems, sluggish demand and competition from China. The leader in efforts to build a European automotive battery industry said on Monday it would suspend plans for a large expansion of its Northvolt Ett factory in Skelleftea, northern Sweden. In an effort to cut costs, Northvolt slimmed down its business earlier this month, departing from its original mission to be an all-in-one shop offering everything from material production and battery making to end-of-life recycling. With Volkswagen (ETR:VOWG_p) among its owners, Northvolt has led a wave of European startups investing billions of dollars in battery production to serve the continent's automakers as they switch from internal combustion engines to EVs. But the Swedish company has struggled with order delays. Problems scaling up production led BMW (ETR:BMWG) to pull a $2 billion order in June. Northvolt said on Monday it would focus on ramping up the first 16 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of annual battery cell production capacity at Northvolt Ett, while shelving a construction project that had aimed at increasing its capacity by another 30 GWh. Currently, the company produces less than 1 GWh and originally planned for the factory to ultimately make batteries for over one million cars a year, at 60 GWh of capacity. Growth in EV demand is also slower than some in the industry projected, and competition is stiff from China, which accounts for 85% of global battery cell production, International Energy Agency data shows. "We are determined to overcome the challenges we face, and to emerge stronger and leaner," Northvolt co-founder and CEO Peter Carlsson said in a statement. "We now need to focus all energy and investments into our core business." The company's R&D hub, Northvolt labs, will slow all programmes and expansion, while maintaining the fundamental platforms, it said. It did not mention the fate of planned gigafactories in Germany and Canada, which are at risk of being postponed. EUROPEAN PROSPERITY Northvolt's "level of ambition and their level of realism at the moment is fairly good in that they're not pushing blindly ahead when it's not working," said Evan Hartley, an analyst at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. Northvolt is still loss-making despite securing orders worth over $50 billion from customers including top investor Volkswagen, underscoring Europe's struggle to compete with the dominance of Chinese battery makers such as CATL and BYD (SZ:002594). The Swedish firm has organised $15 billion in equity and debt financing from a raft of players including Goldman Sachs - its second-biggest investor - and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), according to filings, and has been trying to raise more to fund its ramp-up. It lost $1.2 billion last year, up from a $285 million loss the year before. Its cash on hand at the end of 2023 was $2.13 billion. Former European Central Bank head Mario Draghi warned this month that Europe needed a far more coordinated industrial policy and massive investment to keep pace economically with the United States and China. But many European governments are financially stretched following the COVID pandemic and grappling with anaemic growth. Sweden's Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said on Sept. 13 that while he wanted companies engaged in green technologies to thrive, the government would not take a stake in Northvolt. The government has also said it will not lend to the company. Carlsson said all interested parties should work with the company. "I believe it's important going forward that all the stakeholders we work with now - customers, shareholders, lenders, and also national stakeholders - are contributing to a good long-term solution, because this is about European prosperity and competitiveness," he told Swedish radio.

Title: 'Global Oligarchy' Reigns as Top 1% Controls More Wealth Than Bottom 95% of Humanity

To donate by check, phone, or other method, see our More Ways to Give page. Demonstrators were pictured during a protest demanding higher taxes on the rich on May 1, 2023. "The ultra-wealthy and the mega-corporations they control are shaping global rules to serve their interests at the expense of people everywhere." A report published Monday by the humanitarian group Oxfam warns that decades of intensifying inequality have left the world in the grip of a "global oligarchy" under which the richest sliver of humanity owns more wealth than nearly everyone else combined—a state of affairs that undermines democratic institutions and international cooperation on climate, pandemics, and other crises. Oxfam's analysis of data from the investment banking giant UBS found that the fortune controlled by the top 1% is now larger than the collective wealth of the bottom 95%. Such inequality pervades the global economy, Oxfam noted, with a small number of corporations dominating key sectors. Nearly half of the global seed market, for example, is controlled by just two corporations, Bayer and Corteva. At the same time, just three U.S.-based financial behemoths—Blackrock, State Street, and Vanguard—oversee nearly 20% of the world's investable assets, around $20 trillion. What's more, such massive corporations are increasingly run by billionaires: According to Oxfam, a billionaire either heads or is the top shareholder of more than a third of the world's leading 50 corporations. "While we often hear about great power rivalries undermining multilateralism, it is clear that extreme inequality is playing a massive role," Oxfam executive director Amitabh Behar said in a statement. "In recent years the ultra-wealthy and powerful corporations have used their vast influence to undermine efforts to solve major global problems such as tackling tax dodging, making Covid-19 vaccines available to the world, and canceling the albatross of sovereign debt." "Enabled by rich nations, the ultra-wealthy individuals and corporations they control that benefit from and perpetuate extreme inequality have long impeded international efforts to create a more equitable society." Oxfam released its new report, titled Multilateralism in an Era of Global Oligarchy, ahead of the United Nations' annual high-level general debate, whose 2024 theme is "leaving no one behind: acting together for the advancement of peace, sustainable development, and human dignity for present and future generations." The extreme concentration of global wealth at the very top directly undercuts such objectives, Oxfam argues in its new report, with the ultra-rich using the wealth they've accumulated to influence policy decisions that fuel destructive inequities. "Extreme inequality is, consequently, both a cause and effect of a movement toward global oligarchy, broadly defined here as the ability of the ultra-wealthy to shape political decision-making in ways that increase their wealth," the report notes. "Democracies are afflicted, as the ultra-rich—often through the powerful corporate interests that act on their behalf—can tilt policymaking in their favor at the expense of the majority. Nor is the movement toward oligarchy confined by national borders. It is global, impacting political decision-making within countries and at the international level." Behar said Monday that "the shadow of global oligarchy hangs over this year's U.N. General Assembly." "The iconic U.N. podium is increasingly feeling diminished in a world in which billionaires are calling the shots," Behar added. Oxfam argued the massive wealth gap between the rich and everyone else—as well as the chasm between the so-called Global North and Global South—is antithetical to the kinds of international cooperation needed to tackle existential emergencies, including the worsening climate crisis. The report points to longstanding efforts by multinational corporations, ultra-wealthy individuals, and rich countries to obstruct efforts to establish more progressive global tax structures, depriving lower-income countries of revenue that could be used to combat the climate emergency and improve healthcare and education systems. Corporations have also wielded their influence to tank efforts to reform patent laws that give pharmaceutical companies monopoly control over lifesaving therapeutics and vaccines, which had devastating consequences during the Covid-19 pandemic. "Enabled by rich nations, the ultra-wealthy individuals and corporations they control that benefit from and perpetuate extreme inequality have long impeded international efforts to create a more equitable society, especially those led by Global South countries," the new report states. "The movement toward global oligarchy ultimately perpetuates neocolonial relationships, shaping policy in ways that further increase the wealth of ultrarich individuals, mostly in the Global North, at the expense of the Global South." Oxfam argued Monday that only global solidarity "can reverse the movement toward global oligarchy." "Global South governments and civil society organizations are leading the push for a [World Health Organization] pandemic treaty with strong provisions on technology transfer and benefit-sharing, a U.N. tax convention with ambitious standards on taxing corporations and the rich, and a new international debt architecture that facilitates comprehensive debt restructuring," the report states. "These initiatives are critical opportunities for the international community to replace division with solidarity, a necessity for addressing other pressing issues such as climate change." "Ultimately," the report adds, "a more equitable international order without extreme concentrations of wealth—where corporations pay their fair share, global public health is prioritized, and where all countries can invest in their own people—benefits everyone."

ADWEEK House is your house during advertising's big week in NYC. Join us for content, to take a beat, recharge and make industry connections. RSVP to join us October 8-9 in New York City. Plenty of agencies claim some form of sustainability offerings for clients, but few make it their main focus. As Climate Week NYC gathers global leaders to find ways to tackle climate change, Chiefly & Co., a women-led fractional executive consultancy, is launching to help companies prove that being sustainable is not just the right thing to do, but it’s also good for the bottom line. Chiefly & Co. has created a unique model that combines fractional domain expertise with a commitment to sustainable practices. The consultancy looks to become a go-to partner for companies and organizations that have a desire to accelerate their sustainability efforts while still driving for business success. Founder Melanie Mercier, after stints at BlackRock, Gap, and as a consultant and experiential marketer, decided to get her executive MBA at Tulane University a few years ago. There, she read case studies about organizations like Unilever, which transformed its business through sustainability efforts that led to profitability and success. She also realized the negative impact the experiential and events industry had on the planet and wanted to do something about it. “Sustainability is a business imperative, and it’s not just in one sector, it’s across all business sectors, Mercier told ADWEEK. Mercier cited studies by Morgan Stanley, Accenture, and others showing that sustainability is the new key driver to innovation, value creation, and cost savings and profitability. “There is a misconception out there that sustainability and profitability don’t coexist, when actually they do and they should. We’re helping to shed light on that and bring that to the forefront of businesses,” she added. Debuting during Climate Week NYC—where Mercier will be on hand with a few of the fractional executives on her roster—underscores Chiefly & Co’s commitment to helping businesses take meaningful action on sustainability. The consultancy’s approach leverages the power of top-tier fractional leaders and provides companies with expert guidance to navigate sustainability issues and profits, especially since many companies don’t have that type of leadership and domain expertise internally. Chiefly & Co’s C-suite leaders will ensure success for clients by looking across the organization to break down silos, build consensus, and embed sustainability throughout organization. “No matter where sustainability originates, whether it’s through the marketing function or just coming from the CEO as a mandate, we make sure it is embedded into the fabric of the organization,” said Mercier. Every organization gets tailored strategies from Chiefly & Co. based on the needs and budget, but the company works from frameworks that are aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It also will follow all compliance and reporting guidelines. “It’s really looking at how organizations can innovate, create value, and build strategies, but making sure they’re aligned with the SDGs so companies are on target to hit net zero by 2050, if not sooner, and lowering carbon emissions,” said Mercier. “We’re positioning Chiefly & Co, and our fractional experts, as the planet profit pros.” Taking a fractional executive approach is another step towards sustainability, as the client can scale up or down based on needs. Fractional talent and agencies are a growing trend in the marketing world. While one might call it freelance work, being a fractional C-suite member offers former agency and business executives the freedom to work on high-level projects without being tied to one client or agency. “Fractional is the new modern, sustainable leadership solution and that is the benefit that we bring to businesses,” said Mercier. Mercier continued that some companies may need expertise in a particular area, but they don’t have it internally, so Chiefly & Co. can fill that gap with a fractional executive. Those people have been in executive roles before, so they can easily embed themselves and contribute value, helping organizations meet both commercial and sustainability goals, she explained. “We’re bringing domain expertise and industry expertise into that business, so we would very carefully match a fractional executive with an organization to make sure it’s a good fit and we can deliver on those goals,” Mercier said. Mercier built her team through connections she has culled throughout her career. As she moved into fractional work as a COO, she met other like-minded women—currently, all Chiefly & Co. talent are women—and decided she could create something that brought sustainability to the forefront. She has a collection of CEOs, CSOs, CMOs, talent officers, CXOs and CTOs who have worked for companies including Deloitte, Gap, Microsoft, and JPMorgan Chase to scale for brands seeking top-level fractional talent.
