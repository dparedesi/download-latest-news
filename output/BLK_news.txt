Title: There are 2 problems with Warren Buffett's stock market valuation indicator

With the stock market trading at record highs, Warren Buffett's favorite valuation indicator is also hitting new peaks. The Buffett Indicator, which measures the total market capitalization of US stocks relative to US GDP, hit an all-time peak of about 209% on Monday, surpassing the record high of 200% reached in August 2021. In other words, the US stock market's total market cap of about $61 trillion, as measured by the Wilshire 5000 index, is more than double the annualized US GDP of about $29 trillion. Bearish investors have been quick to point to the Buffett Indicator as yet another signal that the stock market is significantly overvalued and due for a correction. Yet, research from Morgan Stanley suggests the gauge may not be the best valuation tool to follow. Michael Mauboussin of Morgan Stanley's Counterpoint Globlal highlighted two flaws in the famed Buffett Indicator, which Buffett introduced in a 2001 Forbes article. "The first is that U.S. companies now get more of their sales from outside the U.S. than they did in past decades. GDP does not include those sales. That means the numerator, market capitalization, reflects a larger addressable market than what the denominator, GDP, captures," Mauboussin said. The gauge's failure to capture foreign sales is a big deal, considering that about 40% of revenues derived from S&P 500 companies come from international markets. If those revenues were encapsulated in US GDP, then the Buffett Indicator wouldn't be flashing as big of a warning sign as it is today. The second flaw concerns the idea that the economy today is much different than it was in past eras. "Second, GDP is arguably understated because it fails to measure accurately the quality of goods and services as well as the value of new goods and services. The rise of digitalization makes measurement today more challenging than in the past," Mauboussin said. Whereas the GDP-based stock market valuation indicator may have proven more accurate decades ago, when manufacturing was a bigger part of America's economy, that's not the case today. Research from BlackRock and economist David Rosenberg recently has echoed this thinking. "The equity market's changing sectoral composition reflects the transformation taking hold. So, comparing today's index to that of the past is like comparing apples to oranges," BlackRock said last week. Rosenberg, meanwhile, said last week he has recalibrated his long-standing bearish view due to the evolving nature of America's tech-focused economy. Mauboussin's broad conclusion from his analysis of the Buffett ratio is that valuation measures that worked well in the past might not be suited to the current market. "As with most measures, we need to be careful using it when we compare the present to the past," Mauboussin said. For what it's worth, Buffett himself doesn't think his coined stock market valuation indicator is an all-encompassing tell on whether it's a good time to invest. When asked at Berkshire Hathaway's 2017 shareholder meeting about his thoughts on valuation metrics like the Buffett Indicator, the investor said: "Every number has some degree of meaning," Buffett said. "It means more sometimes than others. … And both of the things that you mentioned get bandied around a lot. It's not that they're unimportant. … They can be very important. Sometimes they can be almost totally unimportant. It's just not quite as simple as having one or two formulas and then saying the market is undervalued or overvalued." Still, as Berkshire Hathaway is sitting on more than $300 billion in cash, investors and market observers have speculated that Buffett is concerned about current stock market valuations.

Title: Amazon should buy Bitcoin, shareholders say

Time Published: 2024-12-09T16:42:04Z
Full Content:
Shareholders of Amazon (AMZN+0.19%) have submitted a proposal to add Bitcoin to the balance sheet. The shareholders of the e-commerce giant are urging the company to learn from MicroStrategy (MSTR+1.69%), which heavily invested in Bitcoin, resulting in an increase in its share price. “MicroStrategy – which holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet – has had its stock outperform Amazon stock by 537% in the previous year,” according to a shareholder proposal shared by conservative think tank the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR). “At minimum, Amazon should evaluate the benefits of holding some, even just 5%, of its assets in Bitcoin,” the proposal added. The proposal comes at a time when shareholders of tech giant Microsoft (MSFT-0.35%) are set to vote on Tuesday on whether to invest in Bitcoin. As of this writing, Bitcoin is currently around $99,000 after surpassing the historic $100,000 milestone. The think tank highlighted several institutional and corporate examples to illustrate why Amazon should consider investing in Bitcoin. It pointed to public companies like Tesla (TSLA+4.84%) and Block (SQ-0.78%), which have already added Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Furthermore, the think tank noted that Amazon’s second and fourth largest institutional shareholders, BlackRock (BLK+1.43%) and Fidelity, have launched Bitcoin ETFs, signaling growing confidence in the cryptocurrency’s potential. Additionally, it suggested that even the U.S. government might establish a Bitcoin strategic reserve as early as 2025, underscoring the increasing mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin as a strategic asset. The think tank emphasized the importance of diversifying Amazon’s holdings, even considering Bitcoin’s volatility. According to the proposal, as of September 30, 2024, Amazon’s total assets amounted to $585 billion, with $88 billion held in cash, cash equivalents, and bonds. “Since cash is consistently being debased and bond yields are lower than the true nation rate, Amazon isn’t adequately protecting billions of dollars of shareholder value simply by holding these assets,” said NCPPR. The think tank argued that Bitcoin outperforms bonds as an investment. As of December 6, 2024, Bitcoin’s price had risen by 131% over the past year, surpassing corporate bonds, which saw an average increase of just 5%, per the proposal. This performance highlights Bitcoin’s potential as a more lucrative alternative to traditional bond investments. Whether or not Amazon decided to add Bitcoin, that’s in the future. However, the way its shareholders have argued in favor of Bitcoin represents how the perception of Bitcoin has changed over the years and how it is getting accepted and becoming more mainstream with each passing day.

Title: Amazon shareholders call for the company to hold 5% of its assets in Bitcoin
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/amazon-shareholders-call-for-the-company-to-hold-5-of-its-assets-in-bitcoin/
Time Published: 2024-12-09T16:36:35Z

A group of Amazon shareholders has requested that the company allocate 5% of its assets in Bitcoin. The National Center for Public Policy Research, a free-market, independent conservative think tank, submitted the proposal to Amazon for consideration at its 2025 annual shareholder meeting. The proposal, shared by Tim Kotzman, a podcast host covering Bitcoin and MicroStrategy, recommends adding “assets to its treasury that appreciate more than bonds, even if those assets are more volatile short-term.” The proposal points to Bitcoin’s price, which has increased more than 131% over the past year, outperforming corporate bonds by more than 126%, on average. “MicroStrategy – which holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet – has had its stock outperform Amazon stock by 537% in the previous year,” the proposal said. “And they’re not alone. Institutional and corporate Bitcoin adoption is becoming more commonplace: more public companies such as Tesla and Block have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets; Amazon’s second and fourth largest institutional shareholders – BlackRock and Fidelity, respectively – offer their clients a Bitcoin ETF; and the US government may form a Bitcoin strategic reserve in 2025.” The proposal points out that while Bitcoin is a “volatile asset,” Amazon’s stock was the same in the past. Because of this, companies have “a responsibility to maximize shareholder value over the long-term as well as the short-term,” adding: “Diversifying the balance sheet by including some Bitcoin solves this problem without taking on too much volatility. At minimum, Amazon should evaluate the benefits of holding some, even just 5%, of its assets in Bitcoin.” The shareholder proposal comes as Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy, said to Microsoft that Bitcoin is the best asset a company should own, claiming it represents the “greatest digital transformation of the 21st century.” In a three-minute video posted on X last week, Saylor said: “Microsoft can’t afford to miss the next technology wave, and Bitcoin is the next wave. Bitcoin represents the greatest digital transformation of the 21st century; it represents digital capital.” Talking about long-term capital, Saylor noted that risk – including general taxes, politics, recession, regulation, war, and the weather – is destroying over $10 trillion in capital each year. Because of this, investors are turning their attention to digital capital, such as Bitcoin, to avoid these risks. In Saylor’s view, “it makes sense” for Microsoft to buy and hold Bitcoin rather than buy back stock or hold bonds. “If you’re going to outperform, you’re going to need Bitcoin,” Saylor said. “You’ve surrendered hundreds of billions of dollars of capital over the past five years, and you’ve just amplified the risks that your own shareholders face. If you want to escape that vicious cycle, you’re going to need an asset without counterparty risk.” In Saylor’s opinion, that lies with Bitcoin.

Title: BlackRock’s $12B Purchase Of HPS Wrecks The ‘Easy Money’ Fed Narrative

NEW YORK, NEW YORK - APRIL 26: Scott Kapnick speaks onstage during the Room to Read 2023 New York ... [+] Gala at Gotham Hall on April 26, 2023 in New York City. (Photo by Cindy Ord/Getty Images for Room to Read) There’s no such thing as “easy money” or “costless credit” contra what readers are told with great regularity by economists and their enablers in the commentariat. Evidence supporting this statement of the obvious can most easily be found in the powerful force that is compound interest or returns. Precisely due to the power of both, it’s far too costly for those with title to money to part with it cheaply. Despite these truths, commentators including Ruchir Sharma and Christopher Leonard have endlessly promoted the fiction of easy credit, and economists including the self-regarding Thomas Hoenig have routinely aided them in their promotion of fiction. Thankfully reality always intrudes. The most recent intrusion has reached us care of HPS Investment Partners. Founded in 2007 by former Goldman Sachs partner Scott Kapnick, HPS is in the business of private credit whereby it lends directly to businesses. Crucial about what HPS does for the purposes of this write-up is that per a Wall Street Journal article describing HPS’s $12 billion acquisition by BlackRock, “Its once-obscure business of lending directly to businesses has boomed in recent years while banks have pulled back from making risky loans.” Which requires a pause. Stop and think about when HPS opened its doors (2007), and in thinking about it, contemplate the years in which it grew from something small into a thriving business that rated a $12 billion purchase price. 2007 marked a brief beginning of the end of the Fed’s allegedly “easy money” policies, policies that resumed with great speed in 2008 and beyond. In short, HPS’s business of lending directly at higher rates of interest to businesses less able to attain loans from risk-averse banks soared at precisely the time when the Fed was at or near zero. It all raises an obvious question: what purpose would HPS have served if and when credit was costless, as endlessly asserted by Sharma, Leonard et al? It’s a good question, and it can be answered with the simple truth that the surest sign of tight bank credit is low or “zero” rates of interest care of a Federal Reserve that is invariably following actual banks with its vain rate machinations. When banks are charging exceedingly low rates of interest on loans, that’s the surest sign that they’re only lending to the safest of safe borrowers. Translated, low rates of interest signal tight credit whereby risk averse banks lend to sure things. All of which speaks to the genius of Kapnick and his partners for operating in the real world, and in operating in the real world, seeing well beyond the simplistic economic analysis that takes what the Fed does literally. Please. If the Fed could decree credit “costless” or “cheap” as the conventional in thought tell us over and over again, there would be no credit. Something about price controls leading to scarcity. Instead, we see through HPS’s grand success that actual markets prosperously work around the central planners at the Fed. While a central bank desperately searching for relevance made headlines with toothless rate interventions, companies like HPS were providing actual credit to actual businesses at market rates of interest that reflected actual credit costs that no central bank or government associated with a central bank could ever erase. Which is a positive signal, but also an obvious one. It’s positive in the sense that HPS’s multi-billion dollar acquisition reminds us yet again that credit prices aren’t planned by central planners, and it’s obvious simply because if the Fed could do what economists and commentators think it can, the U.S. economy would be too wrecked to write about in the first place.

New data from blockchain analytics firm Akham reveals that asset management titan BlackRock has gone on an aggressive Bitcoin (BTC) accumulation spree. In a new thread on the social media platform X, Arkham says that BlackRock – which has over $10 trillion in assets under management – bought billions of dollars worth of BTC in less than a week. “BlackRock bought $2.6 billion of Bitcoin this week. That’s more than half a billion every day.” Bitcoin is trading for $99,137 at time of writing, a marginal decrease during the last 24 hours. Arkham also reveals that the asset management giant has been gobbling up the top smart contract platform Ethereum (ETH) at a rapid rate as well. According to Arkham’s data, BlackRock has scooped up $500 million worth of Ethereum last week, raising its balance of Ether by 50% during the last 30 days. Ethereum is trading for $3,935 at time of writing, a 1.33% decline in last 24 hours. Arkham also unveils the BTC holdings of SpaceX and Tesla, two tech companies owned by billionaire Elon Musk. According to the blockchain analytics firm, the Bitcoin stacks held by SpaceX and Tesla are up nearly 3x from their average cost basis. “Elon Musk’s companies’ Bitcoin now worth $2 billion. Tesla: 11,509 BTC ($1.17 billion); SpaceX: 8,285 BTC ($842 million). This Bitcoin was acquired at an average cost basis of $34,980 per BTC, meaning they are up $1.3 billion (186%) on these purchases.” Generated Image: Midjourney Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

Title: Why RPC, Inc. (RES) Is Among the Best Dividend Paying Debt Free Stocks to Invest in

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best Dividend Paying Debt Free Stocks to Invest in. In this article, we are going to take a look at where RPC, Inc. (NYSE:RES) stands against the other best debt free stocks that pay dividends. Debt financing is not inherently negative; its impact largely depends on how effectively it is utilized. When managed properly, it can drive substantial cash flow and enhance returns for shareholders. However, poor management of debt can weaken a company’s financial stability. In the second quarter, corporate debt levels decreased despite benchmark interest rates remaining unchanged between April and June. Total debt for both investment-grade and non-investment-grade companies fell to $8.432 trillion, down from $8.517 trillion in the previous quarter. Investment-grade companies reduced their debt by approximately 0.9% to $6.610 trillion, while those rated below BBB- by S&P Global Ratings lowered their debt by about 1.2% to $1.822 trillion, based on data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. READ ALSO: 10 Dividend Knights that Beat The Market Last 3 Years The S&P Global report also highlighted that while total debt among U.S. investment-grade companies declined overall, seven out of 10 nonfinancial sectors experienced debt growth in the second quarter. The energy sector recorded the largest increase, with total debt rising by 4.1% to $502.03 billion. However, this increase was largely offset by a significant 12.7% drop, equivalent to $98.87 billion, in debt within the information technology sector. For non-investment-grade companies, debt decreased across eight of the 10 sectors, with consumer staples experiencing the steepest decline at 7.7%. Conversely, total debt rose only in the healthcare and energy sectors within this category. While many US companies maintain strong balance sheets, a significant share of defaults has come from low-rated firms with negative cash flow, high debt levels, and limited liquidity. These heavily indebted businesses, often referred to as “zombies,” struggle to stay afloat, barely covering their loan interest payments, and are vulnerable to even minor setbacks. An analysis by the Associated Press found that nearly 7,000 publicly traded companies globally, including 2,000 in the U.S., fall into this category. These firms were impacted by years of accumulating inexpensive debt, followed by persistent inflation that pushed borrowing costs to their highest levels in a decade. Additionally, much of the borrowed funds were not directed toward growth initiatives like expansion, hiring, or technological investment but were instead used for stock buybacks. Financial analysts have pointed out that U.S. companies have not taken sufficient steps to reduce their long-term debt, leading to a worsening situation. For the first time, annual interest expenses have exceeded $1 trillion, reaching $1.16 trillion in 2024. According to a Treasury official, the average interest rate on government debt increased to 3.32% in 2024, compared to 2.97% the previous year. The Congressional Budget Office projects that the national debt, currently near 100% of GDP, will climb to 122% by 2034. Using debt to support dividends is typically viewed unfavorably, especially in light of practices observed during the 2020 pandemic. At that time, many private companies turned to dividend recapitalization, borrowing funds to maintain dividend payouts. The trend persisted in 2024 as well. As of September 30, 2024, US companies, including those not supported by private equity, have secured a record $70.2 billion in leveraged loans for dividend recapitalizations, based on data from PitchBook. This amount surpasses the $67.2 billion recorded in 2021, the previous high point for such activity. That said, many companies have maintained stable balance sheets, with US firms consistently setting new records for dividend payments year after year. A pressure pumping machine at the centre of an oilfield, surrounded by a team of workers in the field. To create this list, we first used a screener and identified companies with minimal or no debt. From this pool, we selected those that consistently pay dividends to shareholders and compared their enterprise value (EV) to their market capitalization to gauge which ones are debt-free. We then narrowed down the list by including stocks that had sustainable dividend yields. From that list, we picked 8 companies with the highest number of hedge funds having stakes in them, as per Insider Monkey's database of Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

(NYSE:RES) is a Georgia-based oil and gas services company. During the third quarter, the company experienced a decline in revenues and profits due to a challenging oilfield services market. Both oil prices and rig counts decreased sequentially, creating additional difficulties in an already competitive landscape. Non-pressure pumping service lines proved more stable, with a modest 4% aggregate revenue decline, while pressure pumping revenues dropped by a low double-digit percentage. The stock is also down by over 18% since the start of the year. However, broader service lines and larger, more diversified customers remained relatively stable. RPC, Inc. (NYSE:RES)'s Tier 4 dual fuel assets continued to see high utilization with strong visibility, whereas demand for older equipment was weaker. Management plans to implement targeted cost-saving measures to protect margins until industry conditions improve. In addition to this, RPC, Inc. (NYSE:RES) remained debt free at the end of the quarter and returned $8.6 million to shareholders through dividends. The company ended the quarter with $277 million available in cash. In the first nine months of the year, it generated $255.2 million in operating cash flow and its free cash flow for the period came in at $75.8 million. On October 24, the company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share, which was in line with its previous dividend. The stock's dividend yield on December 7 came in at 2.74%. The number of hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owning stakes in RPC, Inc. (NYSE:RES) grew to 14 in Q3 2024, from 11 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a consolidated value of over $60.4 million. With nearly 3 million shares, GAMCO Investors owned the largest stake in the company. Overall, RES ranks 6th on our list of the best debt free stocks that pay dividends. While we acknowledge the potential for RES to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Spot Bitcoin ETFs Attract $9.9 Billion in Inflows After Trump’s Election Victory

Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have seen nearly $10 billion inflows since Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump won the US elections, as investors flocked into the cryptocurrency sector since the results were revealed. The 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs from various major asset managers, including BlackRock and Fidelity Investments, attracted $9.9 billion in net inflows following Election Day on November 5, according to Bloomberg, lifting their assets to around $113 billion. According to data from SoSoValue, spot Bitcoin ETFs currently have $112.7 billion in total net assets, equivalent to around 5.62% of the flagship cryptocurrency’s total market capitalization. These inflows came amid a wider cryptocurrency market rally, which saw the price of Bitcoin briefly top the $100,000 mark before correcting to now trade at $98,000. Over the last 30 days, the price of the flagship cryptocurrency is nevertheless up by more than 28.5%. The total market capitalization of the cryptocurrency space, over the same period, rose by around $1 trillion. Trump notably picked David Sacks, a former PayPal chief operating officer, as the White House’s new AI and Cryptocurrency czar. Sacks, according to Trump, is set to “guide policy for the Administration in Artificial Intelligence and Cryptocurrency, two areas critical to the future of American competitiveness.” Bitcoin’s price rise saw various investors step up their accumulation efforts with Nasdaq-listed business intelligence firm MicroStrategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, earlier this month adding an additional 15,400 coins for $1.5 billion, at an average price of $95.976 per coin. The move saw MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holdings top the 400,000 mark for the first time, with the company achieving a BTC Yield of 38.7% so far this year, and 63.3% year-to-date. It now holds 402,100 BTC that were acquired for $23.4 billion. The move comes at a time in which Bitcoin whales have been taking advantage of the flagship cryptocurrency’s recent price dip to keep on accumulating BTC after short-term holders moved nearly $4 billion in the cryptocurrency to exchanges. According to CryptoQuant analyst Cauê Oliveira, Bitcoin whales took advantage of the “panic selling” to accumulate, with 16,000 BTC worth nearly $1.5 billion entered whale reserves in a single day after short-term holders’ sales. In a post, the analyst noted that the figure was “reflected in institutional addresses on the network” but suggested more BTC was accumulated, as the funds that weren’t withdrawn from cryptocurrency exchanges and remain in users’ accounts aren’t counted. Per his words, the whale accumulation hasn’t been sufficient to demonstrate a “more widespread buy-the-dip” pattern,” which he said remains concentrated among institutional investors.

Conversely, total debt rose only in the healthcare and energy sectors within this category. While many US companies maintain strong balance sheets, a significant share of defaults has come from low-rated firms with negative cash flow, high debt levels, and limited liquidity. These heavily indebted businesses, often referred to as “zombies,” struggle to stay afloat, barely covering their loan interest payments, and are vulnerable to even minor setbacks. An analysis by the Associated Press found that nearly 7,000 publicly traded companies globally, including 2,000 in the U.S., fall into this category. These firms were impacted by years of accumulating inexpensive debt, followed by persistent inflation that pushed borrowing costs to their highest levels in a decade. Additionally, much of the borrowed funds were not directed toward growth initiatives like expansion, hiring, or technological investment but were instead used for stock buybacks. Financial analysts have pointed out that U.S. companies have not taken sufficient steps to reduce their long-term debt, leading to a worsening situation. For the first time, annual interest expenses have exceeded $1 trillion, reaching $1.16 trillion in 2024. According to a Treasury official, the average interest rate on government debt increased to 3.32% in 2024, compared to 2.97% the previous year. The Congressional Budget Office projects that the national debt, currently near 100% of GDP, will climb to 122% by 2034. Using debt to support dividends is typically viewed unfavorably, especially in light of practices observed during the 2020 pandemic. At that time, many private companies turned to dividend recapitalization, borrowing funds to maintain dividend payouts. The trend persisted in 2024 as well. As of September 30, 2024, US companies, including those not supported by private equity, have secured a record $70.2 billion in leveraged loans for dividend recapitalizations, based on data from PitchBook. This amount surpasses the $67.2 billion recorded in 2021, the previous high point for such activity. That said, many companies have maintained stable balance sheets, with US firms consistently setting new records for dividend payments year after year. A pipeline of natural gas cutting through a rural landscape. To create this list, we first used a screener and identified companies with minimal or no debt. From this pool, we selected those that consistently pay dividends to shareholders and compared their enterprise value (EV) to their market capitalization to gauge which ones are debt-free. We then narrowed down the list by including stocks that had sustainable dividend yields. From that list, we picked 8 companies with the highest number of hedge funds having stakes in them, as per Insider Monkey's database of Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 7 Market Cap as of December 7: $127.43 million Enterprise Value as of December 7: $119.6 million Epsilon Energy Ltd. (NASDAQ:EPSN) is an American independent oil and natural gas company that specializes in the acquisition, development, gathering, and production of natural gas and oil reserves. In its recent earnings call, the company reported its fourth consecutive quarter of growth in liquids volume, revenue, and cash flow from its Permian assets, helping to offset the impact of the current natural gas pricing environment. In Pennsylvania, production and cash flow are expected to increase in the fourth quarter and into next year, supported by improving natural gas market conditions. With a diversified and expanding asset portfolio, the company is well-positioned for volume and cash flow growth in 2025. Epsilon Energy Ltd. (NASDAQ:EPSN) reported revenue of $7.29 million in the third quarter of 2024, up from $6.31 million in the same period last year. The revenue also beat analysts' estimates by nearly $403,000. It reported capital expenditures of $3.9 million for the quarter ending September 30, 2024. These expenses were mainly attributed to completing one gross (0.25 net) well in Ector County, Texas, and drilling two gross (1 net) wells in Alberta, Canada. In addition to this, Epsilon Energy Ltd. (NASDAQ:EPSN) demonstrated strong cash generation. In the first nine months of the year, the company generated over $11.8 million in operating cash flow. At the end of the quarter, it had over $8.3 million available in cash and cash equivalents. Moreover, the company returned $2 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Currently, it offers a quarterly dividend of $0.0625 per share and has a dividend yield of 4.29%, as of December 7. EPSN is one of the best debt free stocks that pay dividends. At the end of Q3 2024, 7 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held stakes in Epsilon Energy Ltd. (NASDAQ:EPSN), the same as in the previous quarter. These stakes have a consolidated value of over $33.4 million. Among these hedge funds, Solas Capital Management was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3. Overall, EPSN ranks 8th on our list of the best debt free stocks that pay dividends. While we acknowledge the potential for EPSN to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Crypto ETFs Note Record Inflows as BTC and ETH’s Prices Surge

Cryptocurrrency News The broader digital asset market had a historic week, with rising investor interest in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs). With positive regulatory developments and increasing market confidence, crypto ETFs recorded new milestones that signified the continuation of a bullish market momentum before the year ends. US spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a massive turnaround over the past week as they noted inflows of $2.73 billion. The week started cautiously, with the market experiencing outflows of $435.5 million and $122.8 million on December 2 and 3, which observers believe were influenced by the national holiday. However, the flow momentum changed during the midweek as the sector saw significant daily inflows of $353.6 million, $676 million, $788.7 million, and $376.6 million on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, respectively. BlackRock’s IBIT accounted for over $2.6 billion of the funds flow. This achievement reflects BlackRock’s dominance in the ETF space. In addition, these robust inflows coincided with Bitcoin’s price rise above $100,000 for the first time. BTC’s ascent to its all-time high signifies a psychological victory for the crypto industry, reinforcing the token’s reputation as a hedge against inflation. Like their Bitcoin counterparts, Ether ETFs also saw a notable increase in inflows. The US spot Ether ETFs saw net inflows of about $2 billion this past week. The favorable regulatory climate in the US and the incoming administration’s pro-crypto position contribute to Ether ETFs’ rising appeal. It has encouraged investors to diversify their investment portfolios beyond BTC and contributed to Ether’s strong performance. Many institutional investors prefer Ethereum because, in contrast to Bitcoin, it provides use cases through its smart contract features. Even though the United States still leads the crypto ETF narrative, other nations are making significant strides. One of those nations is Argentina, which has incorporated cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds into its financial markets with President Javier Milei’s approval. The issuance of ETF CEDEARs (Argentine deposit certificates), which give local investors access to overseas crypto-linked assets, was recently approved by the CNV, the country’s securities regulator. Although ETF CEDEARs have been legal for six years, this is the first time they have been issued, making it a significant development for Argentina. This product offers various investment options, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, gold, and the Chinese stock market index. Argentina hopes to use these tools to increase international investment and boost its financial sector. It is worth noting that the South American nation has previously acknowledged the legitimacy of smart contracts and welcomed cryptocurrency-backed funding for businesses. These crypto funds establish the country as a pioneer in digital asset adoption in the region. The global financial landscape is rapidly changing due to the explosive rise of crypto ETFs, which link traditional and digital finance. With inflows from leading players like BlackRock and Fidelity Investments, the total assets under management for Bitcoin ETFs in the US have increased to almost $113 billion. This inflow spike results from increased trust in cryptocurrencies as an asset class. Another notable contributor is Donald Trump’s election win and supportive stance on digital assets. The incoming administration’s supportive legislation will lay the groundwork for a wider acceptance of cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds. Steps like appointing a pro-crypto chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and establishing a unique White House position for digital assets demonstrate a strong commitment to promoting innovation in the industry. Nevertheless, ongoing regulatory clarity, technological advancement, and investor education will be critical to the success of crypto ETFs. For instance, market confidence alone won’t be enough to sustain a push for Bitcoin above $100,000. Other external factors like macroeconomic stability and greater institutional engagement are also necessary. Meanwhile, regions such as Argentina and El Salvador demonstrate how cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds can help cushion economic instability. Countries can open new investment opportunities and attract foreign capital by establishing crypto ETFs like ETF CEDEARs. Your email address will not be published.

Donate Webathon Nick Gillespie | 12.9.2024 8:00 AM There are just two days left in Reason's annual Webathon, the one week a year when we ask our online readers to support our award-winning journalism with fully tax-deductible donations (go here to make yours!). Your support makes everything we do possible—all the articles, videos, podcasts, events, and media appearances in which we act as your voice in public debates about the size, scope, and spending of government. So give a little less to the IRS and a little more to the magazine of "Free Minds and Free Markets"! Scroll down for a great swag list (for what it's worth, my favorites are the "Abolish Everything" T-shirt and the Reason blanket) and donate now. The challenge grant of $30,000 from Daniel Shuchman has now been met and we are happy to announce a new challenge grant of $25,000 from Kerry and Helen Welsh. That means every dollar you donate turns into two until this new challenge grant is reached! This past year has been absolutely crazy, with the weirdest presidential race in U.S. history, including the incumbent dropping out via X (come on, man!), assassination attempts, and one of the most spectacular political comebacks ever. And next year will almost certainly be an even wilder ride, as Donald Trump promises to whittle down the reach of the government even as he pushes tariffs and mass deportation. But maybe the biggest story of 2024—and 2025, too—is something that runs roughshod over and around government: bitcoin, which recently cracked the $100,000 mark and gained a whole new aura of respectability. Reason has been covering this digital gold since its inception and our coverage exemplifies our principled, libertarian approach to journalism. Earlier this year, major investment firms like BlackRock and Fidelity started hawking their own bitcoin ETFs and politicians such as Republican Sen. Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming (a Reason Interview subject) gained new traction calling for a strategic bitcoin reserve. Reason has been lauding bitcoin's challenge to "state-controlled money" from the beginning: Through the Soho Forum, we sponsored a debate in 2018 between bitcoin bear Peter Schiff and bitcoin bull Erik Voorhees that has pulled over 1 million views and remains a great introduction to why this alternative asset is going to be around for the long haul (and why it threatens the establishment): Over the years, we've talked with major figures in the bitcoin world like Michael Saylor, whose company MicroStrategy owns the single-biggest known cache of bitcoin, Broken Money author Lyn Alden, and Balaji Srinivasan, the super-investor whose bold prediction of bitcoin going to a million dollars didn't come true (yet). We explored how the dark web site Silk Road demonstrated a controversial use case for bitcoin and have covered and participated in the annual Bitcoin Conference since its inception. When FTX, the shady crypto exchange run by Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), hit the skids, we talked with Kraken founder Jesse Powell about the need for investor due diligence and how SBF tried to rig regulations in his company's favor. We debunked the phony argument that bitcoin was a disaster for the environment in articles and videos by Alex Gladstein of the Human Rights Foundation, and we showcased how bitcoin provides hope and money for people in authoritarian countries. Jim Epstein's Cypherpunks Write Code video series explored the prehistory of cryptocurrency and Brian Doherty went "In Search of the Elusive Bitcoin Billionaire" in 2018. Senegalese app developer Fodé Diop explained how bitcoin-enabled smartphones might help developing nations break free of what he calls "monetary colonialism": Just last week, Zach Weissmueller and Liz Wolfe talked with crypto podcaster and investor Nic Carter about how Trump's embrace of digital assets affected the 2024 election. Last time around, Trump was antagonistic toward bitcoin and crypto; this time he's all in (in fact, I had a memorable encounter with him at Pubkey, a bitcoin-themed bar in Greenwich Village this fall). Better yet, he's named innovation-friendly Paul Atkins to head up his Securities and Exchange Commission, a giant improvement over outgoing chairman Gary Gensler, who did all he could to throttle crypto. Our coverage of bitcoin—like our coverage of everything—isn't uncritical boosterism, of course. Just a few weeks ago, staffer Katarina Hall reported on her unsuccessful attempts to use bitcoin in El Salvador, the first country to adopt it alongside the U.S. dollar as legal tender. And our resident song parodist Remy not only mocked Dogecoin, he had fun at the expense of tech bros with "Bitcoin Billionaire," a rap that has generated over 1.6 million views: All of this is to say: If you find bitcoin and cryptocurrencies interesting—and if you've made some gains from them in this rally—think about supporting Reason. Since 1968, we've been talking about ways to make the world better, freer, and more fair, all without necessarily dragging government or politics into the matter. Bitcoin is the latest, and possibly greatest, development on that front in a very long time.

Title: Tesla, Google, Amazon: How Much They Are Spending For Their CEOs' Safety

The murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson has cast a spotlight on the extensive security measures employed by Wall Street's elite to ensure their safety. With the increasing risks associated with high-profile roles, companies are shelling out significant amounts to protect their top executives. Big tech firms like Google, Amazon, and Tesla are among the many that prioritise personal security for their CEOs. These measures often include personal security details, private transportation, and state-of-the-art security systems, adding millions to operational costs annually. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella A prime example is Microsoft's CEO, Satya Nadella. Microsoft ramped up security for its CEO, allocating over $58,000 for his travel security this year. This figure was disclosed in the company's SEC filing on October 24. Mr Nadella, set to earn $79.1 million this year, had previously requested a pay reduction to offset rising security expenses after multiple incidents earlier in the year, CNBC first reported. Tesla CEO Elon Musk In the first two months of 2024, Tesla spent $500,000 on Elon Musk's security, more than five times what was spent in the same period in 2019. This follows a significant increase in security costs, with Tesla disclosing $2.4 million spent on Mr Musk's protection in 2023. Between 2015 and 2018, Mr Musk's monthly security expenses averaged $145,000. His protection is managed by high-profile firms, including Gavin de Becker & Associates and his own Foundation Security. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink World's largest asset manager, BlackRock, doubled its security spending for CEO Larry Fink in 2023, as per security filings. The company spent $216,837 on personal security guards and $563,513 on upgrading Mr Fink's home security system. Google CEO Sundar Pichai Last year, Alphabet spent over $6.7 million on CEO Sundar Pichai for expenses, including security, retirement contributions, company vehicles, and other benefits, as per a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. These expenditures formed the bulk of his total compensation package, exceeding $6.8 million. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy In 2023, Andy Jassy's transportation costs totalled $986,164, covering business travel and security upgrades, as per a Quartz report. His compensation dropped compared to 2022, largely due to a decline in Amazon's stock price and fewer restricted stock units. The stock price fell from $156.51 in 2022 to $143.90 in 2023, as per filings. Track Latest News Live on NDTV.com and get news updates from India and around the world

Title: Private Credit’s Struggling Pioneer Is a Warning Sign for Market

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- It was little more than two and a half years ago that Franklin Templeton’s boss Jenny Johnson took to LinkedIn to express her excitement about buying European private credit stalwart Alcentra. Today, a key part of the acquired business is struggling to justify the enthusiasm. Most Read from Bloomberg A Chicago Skyscraper Cements the Legacy of a Visionary Postmodern Architect NYC’s Run-Down Bus Terminal Gets Approval for $10 Billion Revamp Kansas City Looks Back on its Long, Costly Ride With Microtransit In its heyday, Alcentra was up there with current direct-lending success stories such as Ares Management Corp. and Intermediate Capital Group Plc. as they jousted for preeminence in making loans to Europe’s companies. But unlike old rivals that are expanding their assets at breakneck speed, Alcentra has shrunk. At its peak it managed about $43 billion of assets, according to Fitch Ratings. By the time Franklin struck the deal to acquire the London-based lender, it had $38 billion. It now has about $32 billion. Alcentra’s corporate direct-lending franchise, the engine room of most private credit businesses, has halved from €12 billion ($12.7 billion) in 2020 to €6 billion, according to an analysis by Bloomberg News of the firm’s public filings. With other asset-management giants such as BlackRock Inc. and State Street Corp. shopping around for their own purchases in the booming $1.6 trillion private credit market, Alcentra is a cautionary tale from the industry. Franklin’s purchase of Alcentra in 2022 is dwarfed by BlackRock’s acquisition of HPS Investment Partners — and the low sale price reflects problems that predate the sale — but its ongoing troubles with its once-flagship fund are a reminder that fortunes can change fast in this industry. Back in 2019 Alcentra raised one of Europe’s then largest direct-lending funds. Botched leadership changes, a staff exodus and some poor investments have weighed heavily. Five years on it’s still trying to raise a follow-on fund. An Alcentra spokesperson says the firm’s overall assets under management have been “stable” since Franklin’s takeover was completed in November 2022, and that it has seen “strong momentum and performance” in other parts of the business: “Over the last 12 months, we’ve seen successful fund closes and significant fundraising traction in our structured credit and special situations vintages, as well as inflows into our European liquid credit strategies.” Nevertheless, the travails of its direct-lending fund carry a warning for the private credit asset class more broadly. Funds that can’t keep up with returns offered by peers, or who lose staff, are finding it hard to bring in new money as unforgiving investors increasingly put their faith in the promised stability of private capital’s biggest beasts. “More firms have issues now that were previously not apparent,” says Andrew Bellis, head of private debt at Partners Group, speaking generally about the market rather than Alcentra. “There will be a shakeout in the industry, but that happens over a long period of time. We might look back and say, ‘What happened to that firm that used to be big?’” First-Mover Advantage Alcentra was an early mover into European direct lending along with fellow pioneers Ares, ICG and Arcmont Asset Management. But even as this industry has flourished — as private firms muscle in on the lucrative corporate loan business once dominated by Wall Street — the trailblazer has floundered. While rivals have been targeting fundraisings comfortably over €10 billion and expanding their direct-lending arms, Alcentra is the odd one out. Its latest fund for this market was registered in Luxembourg more than four years ago and, so far, there’s been no public statement about it reaching any milestones. Franklin’s acquisition was part of a major expansion in alternative assets by the $1.6 trillion investment giant after buying Lexington Partners, a private equity fund manager. Franklin and its ilk have been drawn to private markets by the allure of higher returns and as a way to win back clients who’ve shunned more traditional actively-managed stock and bond funds. Franklin has been one of the asset managers most affected by outflows in recent years, with clients pulling about $176 billion from its funds since 2019, according to Morningstar Inc. It’s also dealing with the fallout of another, more traditional acquisition. Ken Leech, the former star trader of Western Asset Management Co., which Franklin bought through its acquisition of Legg Mason, has been charged by the US for alleged fraud. “Franklin Templeton manages $250 billion in alternative assets, and the Alcentra business is an important part of our offering in the alternative credit space,” a spokesperson for the company says. Part of the problem for Alcentra’s direct-lending arm has been performance. The fund manager has been involved in several debt-for-equity swaps since 2019, according to Bloomberg research, a sign that things weren’t going well for these companies. These include Lifetime Training, an apprenticeship training provider that struggled to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic, and Caroola (previously known as Optionis), a professional services provider that was crippled by a cyber hack in 2022, according to public filings. One Alcentra investor, Strathclyde Pension Fund, said at a recent meeting that the lender provided a 6.7% return over the last year, according to documents seen by Bloomberg, while two other private-debt investments, Barings and Partners Group, delivered 10.9% and 11.1%. Since the start of Strathclyde's investment, however, Alcentra does stack up well against its peers. Strathclyde was candid about where some of the more recent issues arose: “Alcentra has suffered from a high level of senior turnover and has had a change of ownership.” The pension fund has decided to run off its investment, according to the documents, meaning it won’t put any more money in. “The one thing you want to see is consistency in deal performance and the team,” says Vasileios Kocheilas, a seasoned investor in private credit funds. “Investing is about finding the right people to do the right things.” As smaller private credit firms find it tougher to deliver that consistency, and to get new fundraising off the ground, private-capital behemoths such as Blackstone Inc. and Ares are taking the lion’s share of the market’s growth. Investors, known as limited partners, are voting with their feet. “LPs have to make tough decisions on which managers to back,” says Mike Dennis, partner and co-head of European credit at Ares, speaking generally about the market. “We’re seeing LPs consolidate their manager relationships because of liquidity constraints. And for some of those small managers, it’s very difficult to say what their differentiation is.” Size isn’t everything, however. Some of the old titans of traditional money management haven’t cracked this red-hot asset class. Fidelity International halted its early European direct-lending activities this year. BlackRock will hope that buying a premium outfit like HPS will spare any pain, even if it isn’t cheap. At the less exalted end of the private credit market, some are bracing for the emergence of zombie funds, so-called because they own a bunch of illiquid assets and are struggling to raise cash to buy more. Instead, they begin a slow process of withering away. It’s a familiar sight in private equity, where hundreds of firms are in that unhappy position. In private credit, the assets are loans with fixed maturities — so, unlike equity, a fund can’t stumble on forever. But a firm’s future is predicated on its ability to raise more capital and keep scaling. As this nascent asset class matures, subpar performance may lead to a sticky end. “We’re going to see more zombie funds as credit managers will have had so many problematic deals that no one will be willing to give them any more money,” Kocheilas concludes. --With assistance from Loukia Gyftopoulou.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. A group of Amazon (AMZN, Financial) shareholders, led by the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), has recommended that Amazon invest at least 5% in bitcoins. The measure interceptor for review ahead of the 2025 AGM will seek to fix the issue caused by Amazon entering the cryptocurrency market, given that Bitcoin has outperformed most assets, including corporate bonds. Interestingly, MicroStrategy (MSTR, Financial), the company that has chosen to integrate Bitcoin as part of its treasury management, had a significantly better score of 537% when compared to Amazon's stock price in the last year. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with AMZN. This proposal has also highlighted the increasing institutional adoption of bitcoins; different stakeholders, such as Amazon's shareholders, BlackRock, and Fidelity, offer bitcoin ETFs to their clients. This is well in tune with the trend of big firms like Tesla and Block incorporating cryptocurrencies in their working capital. The NCPPR thinks that Bitcoin may create inflation protection and increase steadiness in shareholder value with time. Amazon has yet to make a public response to the proposal; however, its board will have to analyze and decide whether or not to propose the change in the proxy statement for the 2025 meeting. The NCPPR's push comes after an attempt to get Microsoft(MSFT, Financial) to include the digital currency on its balance sheet, which was rejected by the shareholders.

Title: A Bitcoin Miner Promised To Help A Texas Town. It Went Bankrupt Instead. Now, It’s Pivoting To AI

Three years ago, one of the world’s largest bitcoin miners offered a lifeline to the town of Denton, Texas, a community burdened with tens of millions of dollars in debt. The miner, Core Scientific, wanted to build a data center in the city. In exchange for a massive power contract that would double Denton’s energy footprint, the company would provide much needed revenue in the form of taxes and fees. Denton accepted. But within months of powering on, Core Scientific filed for bankruptcy after being saddled with its own outstanding debt. Now, on the heels of the artificial intelligence boom, Core Scientific has reinvented itself as a cloud computing company for AI startups. Last month, the former crypto miner announced that its Denton facility will transform into what it claims will be one of the largest AI supercomputers in North America. It received a green light from Denton’s local government to increase its previously 297-megawatt (MW) power agreement by another 100 MWs, enough to run nearly 400,000 homes — a capacity larger than Elon Musk’s “Colossus” supercomputer in Memphis, Tennessee. Many industrial bitcoin miners have pivoted their operations to AI in hopes of boosting revenue streams after the volatile 2022 market downturn known as “crypto winter.” Companies like Core Scientific, Hut 8, Bitdeer and Terawulf have all retrofitted data centers to accommodate racks of high-end chips needed to train AI models. In June, Core Scientific announced a $3.5 billion contract with AI hyperscaler CoreWeave to provide the data center space needed to host a massive array of Nvidia H100 GPUs, for which it has allocated 200 MWs worth of power. News of the partnership sparked a $4 billion increase in the market cap of 14 bitcoin miners with similar computing resources, according to JP Morgan. In Denton, Core Scientific spent nearly three years developing datacenters to mine crypto before deciding to make the switch. The transition is a relatively simple one — Core Scientific has retired its mining machines, and will be updating existing buildings to support rows of GPU servers. The Austin-based company was founded in 2017 by Aber Whitcomb, who previously cofounded Myspace, along with Darin Feinstein and CEO Mike Levitt. Over the following years, it opened a number of facilities across the southern U.S. In 2023, after filing for bankruptcy, it received a $500 million loan from creditors including BlackRock and Apollo Global Manager. Last month, the miner reported $95 million in third quarter revenue and $415 million in revenue for the year. It currently operates nine data centers in Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina, North Dakota and Texas. Core Scientific did not initially disclose its identity to the public, and one city council member who voted against the proposal called it a “deal with the devil” Core Scientific was drawn to Denton because of its abundance of electricity and cheap real estate. At the time, the city’s local power utility, Denton Municipal Electric (DME), had recently incurred $210 million in electricity fees during a historic winter storm in 2021 that caused energy costs to skyrocket. When Core Scientific proposed building its data center in town — a project that would supposedly deliver the utility up to $8 million a year in revenue — DME was $140 million in debt. But residents and some Denton city officials were skeptical of the project because of its secretive nature and large energy footprint. Core Scientific did not initially disclose its identity to the public, and one city council member who voted against the proposal called it a “deal with the devil,” BuzzFeed News previously reported. Another council member said, “We don’t need to allow an unidentified company to use our city’s infrastructure to increase greenhouse gas emissions for the sole purpose of turning a profit.” But they ultimately supported the project after DME convinced them that Core Scientific would shoulder 100% of the risk. Got a story tip? Contact Sarah Emerson on Signal at 510-473-8820 or email semerson@forbes.com. Denton’s partnership with Core Scientific was announced in October 2021 and its facility became operational four months later. In December 2022, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy after experiencing $434 million in losses the preceding quarter, citing liquidity issues caused by a number of factors including energy costs and bitcoin prices that fell by 60% that year. It opted not to liquidate and continue mining crypto, but halted the completion of its Denton facility, which left two large buildings unfinished. In January of this year, Core Scientific restructured $400 million in debt and received court approval to exit bankruptcy. A few months later, it had signed an AI computing contract with CoreWeave. CoreWeave has ridden the AI wave to a $1.5 billion valuation and reported $250 million in revenue last year. As one of the primary distributors of Nvidia chips, it’s found a niche renting on-demand compute space to AI startups. Last year, it struck a deal with Microsoft to provide potentially billions of dollars worth of GPUs to support Microsoft’s partnership with OpenAI. Core Scientific’s bankruptcy meant that Denton “received less than originally anticipated” because the project was never fully built out, Stuart Birdseye, spokesperson for Denton’s power utility DME, told Forbes. DME earned $2.3 million in revenue from the data center last year, according to the North Texas Daily, though Birdseye told Forbes that income from Core Scientific “was a net positive for the city in total.” Now, it stands to bring in much more. In addition to an increased power capacity, Core Scientific will lease more than 40 new acres of land near its facility for an AI computing campus. The company’s proposed $6.1 billion property investment is expected to result in $194 million in property tax revenue for the city over the first 10 years after the build-out is complete some time in 2027, the city said. Neither DME nor Core Scientific elaborated on how that money will be distributed over time. City manager Sara Hensley said in a statement that the site will “serve as a model for high-performing computing innovation” as Denton courts other high-tech investments. AI data centers, which typically run continuously, have yet to show the same willingness to halt processing voluntarily if local electricity demands surge In a recent announcement, Denton’s government also claimed the project will create “an estimated 300 full-time, on-site positions, and over 200 independent jobs from entities that would support the operation.” A Core Scientific spokesperson told Forbes that “actual hiring plans have not been finalized but we believe most of the jobs created will be filled locally.” Similar to the development of its crypto mining operation, Core Scientific will assume the cost of updating transmission infrastructure, such as two new substations that will be needed to accommodate its larger power load. The company would only disclose CoreWeave as a customer for the Denton site; the startup counts among its customers Microsoft and Nvidia. Unlike Core Scientific’s mining center, however, its supercomputer will not be immediately participating in a program known as “demand response” that requires large power customers to limit their operations when energy demands are spiking. Many of the bitcoin giants that flocked to Texas during the crypto boom touted their ability to shut down at a moment’s notice, since it was easy to halt mining as needed. Some even profited from an arrangement with ERCOT, the state’s power grid operator, which allowed them to sell back pre-purchased electricity on the energy marketplace. Last year, the miner Riot Platforms reportedly earned $31 million from ERCOT this way. AI data centers, which typically run continuously, have yet to show the same willingness to halt processing voluntarily if local electricity demands surge, such as during a storm. Previously, Core Scientific was also enrolled in ERCOT’s demand response program, but told Forbes it will “reassess our ability to participate” after the computing equipment is installed. Birdseye said DME still has the ability to interrupt the facility’s power supply when the grid is stressed, but did not elaborate on how those instances will be handled with Core Scientific. In Memphis, where Elon Musk has said his xAI supercomputer will host 1 million GPUs, the state’s power utility has required the company to enroll in its own demand response program. Moving forward, the city insists that Core Scientific’s expansion will not derail its environmental goals. Since 2020, Denton has offset 100% of its energy footprint mostly through local renewable energy contracts, and claims to be the first Texas city to do so. BuzzFeed News had reported that Core Scientific’s crypto mine involved the buying of “renewable energy credits” or RECs, which are a controversial accounting mechanism allowing companies to offset their emissions on paper. “This will continue to be the case as the city’s energy needs increase, which includes this development,” said Birdseye, who added that staff are “currently analyzing these future needs and is developing a strategy to continue with this process.”

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change Quote of the Week: ““It can scarcely be denied that the supreme goal of all theory is to make the irreducible basic elements as simple and as few as possible without having to surrender the adequate representation of a single datum of experience.” – Albert Einstein (1933) Number of the Week: Over 7 days THIS WEEK: By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP) Scope: Discussed in This Week is the failure of wind and solar plus a battery to deliver power needed for a small, isolated community, population 20,000, in Australia. Also discussed is the need to separate two distinct properties of water vapor when considering the greenhouse effect. An extensive list of general failures of climate models is presented. An interpretation of the failure of the recent UN COP meeting is given. Suggestions for improving US weather prediction are made. A disturbing interview, if facts are verified, is presented. ****************** The Potemkin Village: For a decade, engineers such as the late Roger Andrews have discussed the tremendous electricity storage requirements needed to supply electricity when wind and solar fail. Thus far the largest storage facilities have been pumped hydro-storage first developed in Switzerland over 100 years ago. Such facilities must be replenished on a timely basis, otherwise they fail. Timely replenishment requires reliable power, such as from hydrocarbons or nuclear. Two experiments to run exclusively on wind and solar power have failed. One was on El Hierro (population about 13,000) in the Canary Islands and the second on King Island (population about 1,500) off Tasmania – hardly complex modern cities with huge energy needs. Commentators such as Francis Menton have called for a demonstration project showing that a modern city or community can thrive on wind and solar plus storage. In an essay on Climate, Etc. utility planning engineer Russell Schussler discusses a third experiment. He writes: “In October of 2024, the isolated small city of Broken Hill in New South Wales, Australia with a 36 MW load (including the large nearby mines) could not be reliably served by 200 MW of wind, a 53 MW solar array, significant residential solar, and a large 50 MW battery all supplemented by diesel generators. Many people falsely believe that wind, solar and batteries have been demonstrated to provide grid support and deliver energy independently in large real word applications. Few people realize that we are a long way away from having wind, solar and batteries support a large power system without significant amounts of conventional spinning generation (nuclear, gas, coal, hydro, geothermal) on-line to support the grid. Broken Hill Outage – Wind, Solar and Battery Can Not Support the Grid The recent outages occurring in Broken Hill help illustrate the inability of wind, solar and batteries to support electric grids without significant help from machines rotating in synchronism with the grid. (Note – wind power is produced by rotation but not in synchronism with the grid). Around 20,000 people live in the Broken Hill area. Over $650 million in investment made Broken Hill home to a 200 MW wind plant, a 53 MW solar array, and a large battery that could provide 50 MW of power for 100 MWh through advanced grid forming inverters. Broken Hill is home to over 6,000 small-scale solar systems providing a per capita energy small solar production level almost twice the Australian average. The area also contains two poorly maintained diesel-powered gas turbine generators in the area, one which was off-line for maintenance. Broken Hill became renewable energy industry’s Potemkin Village: In 2018, Broken Hill City Council announced its goal to become Australia’s first carbon-free city by 2030. Three years ago, then mayor Darriea Turley welcomed the announcement that AGL was proceeding with plans to build a grid-scale battery, which the company claimed would be a reliable backup power source for 10,000 homes. “This is a great opportunity for Broken Hill and renewable energies,” Turley told the ABC. “What they will see is when there is an outage, the battery would click into operation.” In October of 2024, this area was separated from the larger grid when the interconnecting transmission towers went down in a bad storm. Loads in Broken Hill are limited to about 20 MW of mining load and 17 MW that serve the local town for a combined load of 36 MW. The over 300 MWs of renewable energy from wind, solar and battery storage, along with a diesel generator were not able to provide reliable power to support the town alone.” Schussler gives a graph of the nameplate capacity of the resources and the loads then states: “A 25 MW gas plant or a 25 MW hydro plant would have done a much better job than the combined efforts of 200 MW of wind, 53 MW of solar, the 34 MW of distributed solar and 50 MW battery. The consequences for Broken Hill were serious. The Australian ran an article entitled: Broken Hill: Powerless and left to live like mushrooms where it described the situation: ‘The power comes on from time to time but goes out just as quickly. It gives us just enough time to power our phones and read emails from energy providers sent the day before, alerting us to the fact the power was about to go out. They also warn we don’t have much time, and to avoid using unnecessary electrical devices – air conditioners, fridges or fans that need a power point.’ In theory the area could be served, but in reality, as noted by Jo Nova, ‘The fridges in the pharmacies failed, so all medications had to be destroyed, and emergency replacements sent in. Schools have been closed. Freezers of meat are long gone… Emergency trucks are bringing in food finally.’” Schussler discusses the big differences between theory and practice which often occur. In theory, the battery at Broken Hill should have worked, but it didn’t. Failure to recognize this difference leads to fuzzy thinking about Microgrids. Microgrids with batteries require the same battery capacity as needed to meet the longest period in which there is little or no electrical generation. These periods of time are grossly underestimated by wind and solar promoters and their political collaborators. [For a current example, Cliff Mass reports that a formidable pool of cold, dense cloud-laden air has settled within the Columbia River Basin, resulting in virtually no power generation from all the wind turbines for a whole week. Wind power is often over 2,000 megawatts, and accounts for over 10% of the generation capacity of the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) Balancing Authority Area. Of course, BPA relies on the largest hydro-generation system in the US, which some local politicians such as the governor of Washington State are trying to shut down.] Schussler concludes his revealing essay with: “Australia has been much hyped recently as a pioneer in renewables, but the cracks are showing. There are many other stories of emerging problems that could be shared. Germany was the leader before. All that hype has crumbled, showing the Energiewende as a pipe dream with a poison pill. There is a simple point that is being widely ignored: wind, solar and batteries do not support the grid much. There are many tricks employed to help proponents and policy makers overlook this simple fact but eventually reality will hammer the point home. Many excuses for this outage will likely emerge. I’ve heard that changing the battery setting made it more effective than it was initially. Undoubtedly inverter-based technology will continue to improve and wind and solar with the proper settings and equipment will be able to contribute better. While inverter-based generation with computer control may one day provide a lot of options, such technology will also provide tremendous complexity and challenges as well. Who will know how to make so many elements with unlimited potential operating characteristics behave well together across a multitude of potential unknown and unpredictable situations? Experience with the grid has come from many decades of study and practice. As the penetration of inverter-based resources increases I suspect every outage study after the fact will continue to find that the inverter setting could have been better. Many can argue that the grid at Broken Hill could or should have worked better (although the failure was likely beyond their worst fears). That’s typically true for any grid during any outage. To quote Nick Cater again., “If wind, solar and storage can’t keep the beer cold in a small city like Broken Hill, how will it perform when called upon to power the rest of the country?” Policy makers pushing for standalone power systems built primarily on wind, solar and batteries are lurching towards disaster and will only avoid calamity to the extent that they are unsuccessful in their goals of removing conventional rotating machinery or are able to lean on the despised conventional technology of their interconnected neighbors.” In addition, Paul Homewood discusses that for wind power, batteries are needed to balance wind power frequency for the grid. This should not be confused with electricity storage for the grid. In National Grid & The Hornsea Battery, he writes: “The storage will be 600 MWh and is not designed to ‘be used when needed.’ Hornsea 3 will have a capacity of 2.9 GW, so 600 MWh would only be enough to last 12 minutes when the wind stops blowing. Its real role is to balance grid frequency, as wind output can fluctuate even on a minute-to-minute basis.” One problem seldom mentioned by commentators pertains to re-powering the grid which for some reason has gone down. Imagine a small grid drawing (say) 100 MW normally supplied by a combination of solar, wind, and batteries, that suddenly goes down. Residents, businesses, hospitals, and small factories have lights, motors, refrigerators, computers, and instruments of all kinds turned on and waiting for power. Re-powering that location requires the sudden change from zero power to 100 MW, with all generators synchronized to within a few milliseconds. What can easily be accomplished by a single 100-MW generator becomes an impossible dream with the distributed power sources. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy, Changing Weather, and Alternative, Green (“Clean”) Energy – Storage. ****************** Two Processes Not One: On her blog Jennifer Marohasy posted an audio interview with William Kininmonth with summaries and slides. Kininmonth was the head of Australia’s National Climate Centre at the Bureau of Meteorology from 1986 to 1998. He asserts that oceans warm the atmosphere as opposed to the atmosphere warms the oceans as claimed by many global warming advocates. The infrared radiation given off greenhouse gases cannot penetrate beyond a few centimeters of ocean, fractions of an inch; thus, the atmosphere does not warm the ocean, while sunlight and geothermal events at the bottom do. Unfortunately, Kininmonth combines two properties of water vapor; one property applies to water vapor alone, the other to all greenhouse gases. This has been a common problems since John Tyndall discovered that certain gases in the atmosphere absorb heat energy emitted by Earth, slowing (blocking) the release of that energy to space; thus, slowing Earth’s heat loss. This explained why the land masses of Earth stay warm enough at night to support growing plants, and life itself. With his experiments in spectroscopy beginning in 1859, Tyndall eventually identified that the dominant greenhouse gas was water vapor, giving rise to the confusion. Water involves two distinct processes and one, the water cycle, applies to it alone. Water evaporates, creating water vapor which requires heat for the phase change. Thus, water vapor contains what is called latent heat, which is predominantly from sunlight and some geothermal energy. Convection brings it from the surface of Earth into the upper troposphere which is cooler than the surface and lower troposphere. In the upper troposphere water vapor condenses into liquid water giving off latent heat. The second process of interest is the interaction between heat radiation (infrared, IR) and individual H2O molecules (called water vapor by chemists). Due to a plethora of vibrational and rotational modes of the H2O molecules, they can both absorb and emit IR at a very wide range of wavelengths (“colors,” for lack of a better word). Collisions with atmospheric molecules can energize H2O molecules, which can then radiate IR. Equally, collisions can remove energy, reducing the amount of IR emitted by H2O molecules. The details of these energy-transfer processes depend on atmospheric pressure, atmospheric temperature, and the exact wavelength under consideration; and are carefully calculated by experts like van Wijngaarden and Happer. Such interactions among molecules and IR are loosely termed the greenhouse effect. However, the greenhouse effect is defined by the IPCC as the numerical difference between the amount of IR emitted by the surface and the amount of IR sent to space. The work of van Wijngaarden and Happer recognizes the distinction between the water cycle, which is a driver of convection, and the greenhouse effect. Consequently, they are able to demonstrate how water vapor interferes with the effectiveness of other greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide, rendering them ineffective as greenhouse gases in Earth’s atmosphere. Unfortunately, William Kininmonth fails to make the important distinction between the role of water vapor in the water cycle and the role of water vapor in the greenhouse effect. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy – Radiation Transfer and Challenging the Orthodoxy. ****************** Global Climate Model Failure: General Circulation Models, now called Global Climate Models, fail to consider the geological prospective of Earth. We are in a brief warm period during Icehouse Earth with ice caps at both ends. We have no ability to predict when it will end, and glaciation will return. Further, the models cannot predict Dansgaard–Oeschger events (often abbreviated D–O events) and Bond cycles, rapid changes in temperatures which occur every, roughly, 1,500 years – rapid warming followed by slow cooling. John Robson produced a video interview with Javier Vinós along with a post stating some of the many failures of Global Climate Models that Vinós uncovered. Climate change is an extremely complex topic with many uncertainties. To say that the science is settled is absurd. For that reason, TWTW prefers to focus on one of the uncertainties for which we can collect proper data and determine its influence, the role of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide. The best physical evidence indicates that adding carbon dioxide in today’s atmosphere has a minor impact on influencing temperatures. For topics on which the models fail see links under Model Issues. ****************** UN Failure: Writing in American Thinker, retired economics professor William Hawkins gives an account why the annual UN Conference of Parties (COP) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) have failed to produce binding agreements that have been long sought by some, despite the flashy headlines of dire outcomes if agreements are not reached. Hawkins writes: “The United Nations has been looking for issues deemed larger than the perennial conflicts of traditional geopolitics. It created the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1992 to acquire the authority to run the global economy so as to “save the planet” and “equitably” share the benefits of “sustainable” (i.e., limited) development. It holds a massive conference (over 65,000 attendees) towards the end of each year staged as if governments were adhering to UN mandates. The 29th Conference of the Parties (COP29) in the FCCC series concluded Saturday (Nov. 23) in Baku, Azerbaijan. It ran a day over the two-week schedule as compromise language was hammered out that would allow member states to do as they pleased. As much as the UN bureaucrats hate to admit, the UN is still a member organization, with the world’s leading national governments making the real decisions as to the policies they will adopt to advance the best interests of their citizens. There are no UN mandates. This concept was formally eliminated at COP15 in Copenhagen in 2009. That meeting was the peak of the FCCC campaign with a massive buildup by activist groups around the world for the two years prior. President Barack Obama was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize to encourage him to commit to the UN climate agenda that President George W. Bush had rejected. COP15 was supposed to adopt a “legally binding” treaty to replace the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. The plan had been to impose on the “rich” developed countries a requirement that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions be cut by 25-to-40 percent by 2020 from 1990 levels. Such a drastic measure would have locked the developed countries into a permanent recession. Meanwhile, the developing countries, led by the BASIC (Brazil, South Africa, India, and China) coalition, would not have had any mandated restrictions on their GHG emissions because they have a sovereign “right” to economic growth. The terminology was “common but differentiated responsibilities.” All must be concerned, but only some (the West) need to do anything about it. In the last days of COP15, President Obama met directly with the BASIC delegates and told them either everyone has a mandate to act, or no one does. The frank result was no one has a mandate. Instead, each nation is simply “called upon” to report to the UN what they are doing about climate change (if anything). The look back at COP15 is important in understanding COP29, as the division between the developed and the developing countries was at the center of the negotiations with the latter again insisting on the old, discarded Kyoto formula. The purpose of the Baku summit was much reduced from past meetings, reflecting the evolution of thought of member states against the demands of the UN bureaucrats. This was apparent in last year’s COP28 held in Dubai (a site which like Baku is based on oil production) There were commitments to triple renewables capacity and double energy efficiency by 2030 and to make progress on adapting to any climate change that occurs rather than curtail (or even reverse) energy use and other human activities in an attempt to prevent climate changes. The favored approach was incremental and cost-conscious. The final language called for “transitioning away from fossil fuels in energy systems, in a just, orderly and equitable manner” (giving plenty of wiggle room) while the term “phasing out” fossil fuels was rejected.” Hawkins discusses that despite dire predictions, the US Energy Information Administration projections show energy use will increase by over 50% by 2050, including increases in coal, natural gas, and nuclear power. BASIC countries (which other identify as BRICS countries) will continue to demand enormous sums of money for slowing economic growth which the use of fossil fuels promotes. [Apparently, the leadership of these countries are not as easily bought off as once thought.] After reviewing the situation, Hawkins concludes: “Even in the fantasy land of the UN, reality rears its head. President Trump’s rejection of the ‘climate emergency’ delirium will not make him an outlier, but a leader in the continuing world-wide effort to build societies in which people can lead better lives on their own terms.” See link under Challenging the Orthodoxy. ****************** Weather Prediction: Meteorologist Cliff Mass argues that the US has fallen behind other countries, particular the EU, in weather predictions, despite spending a great sum of money. In his essay “Make American Weather Prediction Great Again!” Mass asks: “Why is U.S. Government Weather Prediction Lagging?” To which he responds: “The reasons are fairly clear: The U.S. numerical weather prediction effort is divided, with NOAA, the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Air Force, NASA, and the Department of Energy all funding substantial efforts. Resources are sub-optimal at each agency and uncoordinated. All substantially lag the European Center in forecast skill. The capabilities of the large U.S. weather research community are not sufficiently applied by government efforts. This is particularly true of the university-based National Center for Atmospheric Research, which has developed an advanced global prediction model that is not used for global prediction by NOAA or other agencies. NOAA/NWS has grown a large inefficient bureaucracy for the management and development of numerical weather prediction. Responsibilities are divided and duplication is extensive.” To this TWTW adds: We should separate weather prediction entities from climate predictions entities. The two are incompatible and should not be under the same entity – NOAA. Let them stand alone and see how they do. See link under Challenging the Orthodoxy. ****************** Bar Talk or Real? Project Veritas is a conservative group that uses hidden cameras to try to embarrass its subjects. It recorded a person who was under the influence of alcohol and who was described as a consultant to the EPA. That person stated that the EPA was sending billions of dollars to many small select groups to oppose the incoming Trump administration. It is not clear if these assertions are bar talk or are verifiable actions by the EPA. Certainly, the Biden administration misled many with the Inflation Reduction Act in which it allocated billions of dollars for unreliable, expensive, and unneeded wind and solar power. See links under Defending the Orthodoxy. ****************** Number of the Week: Over 7 days. Wind power in the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) has a nameplate capacity of about 3,000 megawatts. For seven days, the wind generated virtually no power. For wind and solar nameplate capacity has little meaning. The BPA transmission system covers about 300,000 square miles primarily in the Pacific Northwest. Imagine the complexity of cold starting that system after 7 days of no power.

How to Preserve America’s International Leadership Role on Climate Change By Jackson Blackwell, Real Clear Energy, Dec 3, 2024 With a potential American retreat from the Paris Climate Accords looming large, it is clearer than ever: we have to make a sustained energy transition a bipartisan priority in the U.S. To do so, philanthropists must close the gap in right-of-center climate organizing and advocacy. Amazingly, less than 1% of the climate movement’s resources go toward engaging and mobilizing conservatives and Republicans on this issue.

C By Roy Spencer, His Blog, Dec 3, 2024 With this update, we have added Metop-C to our processing, so along with Metop-B we are back to having two satellites in the processing stream. The Metop-C data record begins in July of 2019. Like Metop-B, Metop-C was designed to use fuel to maintain its orbital altitude and inclination, so (until fuel reserves are depleted) there is no diurnal drift adjustment needed. Metop-B is beginning to show some drift in the last year or so, but it’s too little at this point to worry about any diurnal drift correction. The Version 6.1 global area-averaged temperature trend (January 1979 through November 2024) remains at +0.15 deg/ C/decade (+0.21 C/decade over land, +0.13 C/decade over oceans).

Climate-Change Colonialism Keeps Poor Countries Impoverished Development agencies fund green projects when people need jobs, food and energy. By Bjorn Lomborg, WSJ, Dec. 2, 2024 TWTW Summary: The president of the Copenhagen Consensus writes: “At the latest United Nations climate summit, developing nations slammed rich countries’ pledge to spend $300 billion annually on climate reparations as ‘crumbs.’ The reality is much worse. Wealthy nations likely won’t conjure up $300 billion in new spending. Europe has been roiled by protests against radical climate policies and the 2024 U.S. election was an indictment of, among other things, aggressive climate regulations. Instead, wealthy nations will do what they’ve done before: raid development funds to the detriment of the people they claim to help. Members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development currently spend $223.7 billion a year trying to do good in poor countries through bilateral and multilateral aid and development spending. It is politically much easier for politicians intent on green spending to shift this money to climate purposes than try to get voters to go along with fresh outlays. Rich nations have diverted much of this funding to climate-change initiatives. OECD members spent one-third of their direct development aid on climate in fiscal 2021-22, the most recent year for which data are available. Development banks have twisted their purpose even further: The World Bank last year sent 44% of its lending to climate causes, the African Development Bank 55% and the European Investment Bank 60%. This charade needs to stop. As part of President-elect Trump’s reforms to wasteful government, he should return development aid to policies that make a real difference. Advocates of green aid are right that climate change will hurt poor countries, but almost every other challenge these nations face—from hunger and poverty to disease and poor education—hurts them more. Typically, climate aid is the worst way to improve quality of life or prevent deaths. Some adaptations to extreme weather are prudent. Early-warning systems for hurricanes and dikes can deliver excellent benefits for each dollar spent. But most climate aid does little to help the developing world. What feeble returns it does bring are dwarfed by the good that could have been done if governments spent that money on direct development efforts such as expanding childhood vaccines or improving crops. This is especially true for climate aid that goes toward emission cuts. The very poorest countries in the world are responsible for less than 0.5% of emissions. They don’t need decarbonization. They need growth, which requires access to copious, reliable energy. Given solar and wind power’s unreliability—and consequent reliance on expensive backup power—this will mostly have to come from fossil fuels. Denying these countries access to cheap and reliable energy is equivalent to condemning them to poverty. Perversely, multilateral development banks spend two-thirds of their climate financing—a massive $50 billion a year—on ‘mitigation’ policies, helping poor countries cut carbon emissions and pushing them only to adopt unreliable power sources. When people need jobs and food, it is immoral to give them solar panels instead. Poverty kills nearly 10 million people annually through related problems such as infectious diseases and hunger. By comparison, the climate-change toll is tiny. Extreme weather took an average of 9,000 lives each year over the past decade. There are many core development priorities wealthy nations could fund that would quickly and efficiently save lives and create economic growth. These include reducing the scourges of malaria and tuberculosis, improving learning outcomes and cutting maternal and neonatal deaths. Carbon mitigation in poorer countries, on the other hand, will generate only a minuscule temperature reduction about a century from now.” Mr. Lomborg states that “climate aid” money is lost and that actual development, not green policy, is needed in poorer nations. Why Are UK Electricity Prices So High? Or more accurately, why are UK electricity prices going up and up and up? It’s that nice Mr Miliband, the self-appointed global pied piper of the energy transition, and his coterie of 6th form lunatic advisors… “”Miliband is retaining his long-term advisers. Guiding the UK’s energy policy operation will be climate activist Tobias Garnett, the former coordinator of Extinction Rebellion’s legal strategy team who represented the road-gluing activists in court. Garnett believes our trajectory is currently “descending swiftly into a politics of ecofascism forged in the crucible of scarce resources, droughts, floods, climate wars and forced migration.” Also on the team is Jonty Leibowitz, whose passion is arguing for socialist reforms to football […] A 100% tax “imposed on transfers from abroad“. Just like China’s… … When it comes to his energy brief Leibowitz’ contribution is a policy paper which argues that “regional banking” should be forcibly re-oriented to “financing the energy transition“.

Salter thinks a “fundamental shift” is required to deal with the “climate breakdown“, which includes “taking many cars off the roads altogether.” Her other “nature” proposals include allowing anyone to traipse across private property to make “the countryside open to all” https://order-order.com/2024/08/12/revealed-milibands-extreme-left-policy-team/ Fossil fuel interests and the public at large are in real trouble with this lot. In fact, the exodus from the North sea started last summer. This is terrific but those who need to read it won’t. The ship of climate change has been on-course to disaster for 30+ well-funded and well-promoted years. During those years the growth of safe-clean-reliable and cost-efficient nuclear power has been stalled. Electricity generation from nuclear (Ember and Energy Institute) https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/nuclear-energy-generation?tab=chart&country=~OWID_WRL “The United States invariably does the right thing, after having exhausted every other alternative.” — Winston Churchillhttps://quotes.guide/winston-churchill/quote/the-united-states-invariably-does-the-right-thing-after-having-exhausted-every-other-alternative/ “Commentators such as Francis Menton have called for a demonstration project showing that a modern city or community can thrive on wind and solar plus storage.” I follow and appreciate Menton’s great insights on these technical and societal issues, but I believe that a large-scale city-wide project is unnecessary. I believe that single household will do just as well and will give the necessary results a lot quicker, or at least for a lot less cost. I would start with an existing house somewhere in Kansas, near the geographical center of the nation. The household would have to create all of its energy resources for heating, cooling, automotive (including vacations), and electrical needs, ON ITS OWN PROPERTY. I would allow purchase of BEV charging while on vacations. On-property storage of on-site generated electrical energy would be required for all energy needs. This would require a house with quite a bit of property to safely place all of the wind, solar, and battery or other storage requirements. No grid connection would be allowed. Any depletion of storage would be considered a failure of the project and require a reset of the project start time. I submit that the ability of the project to run a full year, from noon June 21 to noon June 21 of the next year would constitute project success, and then the cost of the project would be scaled up to project the expected cost for the entire nation. At each interim project failure (running out of storage or equipment breakdown), the entire costs to the date of the failure would also be projected as a “more than” cost for the entire nation. I contend that the project will never succeed before the projected costs will exceed even what the most Liberal blue state governance would accept (though, I expect that at least several would attempt to ignore the results). ‘I would start with an existing house somewhere in Kansas, near the geographical center of the nation. The household would have to create all of its energy resources for heating, cooling, automotive (including vacations), and electrical needs, ON ITS OWN PROPERTY.’ Except for the reference to automobiles and electricity, it sounds a lot like “Little House on the Prairie”. But that’s the Left’s objective isn’t it? Absolute power for themselves, liquidation of their opponents and a 19th century subsistence existence for the remaining masses. I’d bet against you on this one. My 2400 square foot cabin easily gets by on 18 m^2 solar panels and a bank of lead acid deep cells. I use maybe 50 gallons of propane for hot water and the stove. Wood for heating – I’ve 5 acres and get plenty of wood from it. I don’t live there even half time, but the systems are barely breaking a sweat. There are lots of off grid homes is what I’m saying. It is generally agreed that the lapse rate and the greenhouse effect are directly tied to each other. Water can change both the slope and the Y intercept of the lapse rate. CO2 can only change the intercept. Kininmonth … asserts that oceans warm the atmosphere as opposed to the atmosphere warms the oceans as claimed by many global warming advocates. There is no doubt in my mind whatsoever that when it comes to polar and tropical mesoscale cyclones, that they draw their energy from the ocean surface through latent heat predominantly in the tropics as opposed to sensible heat in the polar regions. Although I haven’t studies midlatitutes in depth, I can believe the mechanisms are more complex there.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Bitcoin just dropped below $100K for the fifth time this week. Those sell orders aren't slowing down. While Bitcoin is stumbling, something interesting is happening with Ethereum. See, the market's been so focused on Bitcoin's six-figure dream that most people missed what's happening on Ethereum's charts. The patterns? They're starting to look eerily similar to the ones we saw right before 2021's massive run. Ethereum needs a 24% weekly gain to hit its all-time high. Usually, that would sound ambitious. But with BlackRock injecting $500M into ETH holdings and institutional money flowing in, the numbers are starting to make sense. Even the analysts who've been bearish since 2022 are changing their tune. They're talking about "structural changes" and sustainable growth - words they don't throw around lightly. The really interesting part? The resistance levels between here and the all-time high are surprisingly thin. It's like someone cleared the path while we weren't looking. So what's actually going on in the crypto markets right now? Let me break down today's biggest stories... PEPE coin flips Uniswap with an $11B market cap. So what's pumping its price so high? 🤔 Alt season signals are flashing - HBAR +99%, IOTA +79%, JASMY +72%. But what concerning signals is the perpetual futures market showing? 📊 Ethereum ETFs hit a 10-day winning streak. What's sparking such a huge interest in it now? 💫 Bitcoin keeps bouncing off $100K like it's made of rubber. Here’s what's causing this rigid resistance! 🔍 Trump's David Sacks steps in to battle "Operation Choke Point 2.0" as Coinbase shares evidence. What are they? ⚖️ Let’s dive in! PEPE just accomplished something that seemed impossible a few months ago - it jumped over Uniswap in market value. Pepe coin, which started as yet another meme token in 2023, now sits at an $11 billion market cap. That's bigger than Uniswap's UNI token, one of DeFi's cornerstone projects. The surge isn't just a short-term spike either. Since January, Pepe's value has multiplied 18 times, turning what many dismissed as a joke into a serious market player. So what’s pumping its price so high? Read the full story! The alts market is painting an interesting picture right now. Some tokens are going absolutely wild - Hedera jumped 99%, IOTA climbed 79%, and JasmyCoin shot up 72% since November. Meanwhile, Bitcoin's grip on the market is loosening. Its dominance dropped below 55% for the first time in months, sparking debates about whether we're entering the alt-season territory. But there's a problem. The perpetual futures market is showing some concerning signals. What are they? Read the full story! Ethereum ETFs just hit a milestone - 10 straight days of money flowing in, pushing the weekly total to a staggering $836.7 million. Fidelity is leading the charge, with their Ethereum Fund pulling in $47.9 million in a single day. The total trading volume is hitting record after record, approaching $1 billion daily. The timing couldn't be more perfect. Ethereum just broke past $4,000, hitting levels we haven't seen since March. And it's not just the price - the NFT market is showing signs of life again, with top projects posting double-digit gains. But remember when analysts were calling ETH ETF a gigantic failure just a few months ago? What’s sparking such a huge interest in it now? Read the full story! Bitcoin crossed 100K again, only to fall back to 99K (again). Back in 2011, you could buy a Bitcoin for just $1. Two years later, it hit $1,000, and people thought that was crazy. Now? We're talking about six figures. So what’s causing this rigid resistance? Read the full story! David Sacks, Trump's new AI and Crypto Czar, is stepping into a battle that's been brewing beneath the surface of crypto regulations - the mysterious "Operation Choke Point 2.0." The story starts with Silvergate Bank's collapse. Chris Lane, their former CTO, stated that the bank was perfectly solvent after FTX's fall, but regulators systematically cut off their ability to serve crypto clients until they had no choice but to shut down. Now Coinbase has entered the chat with some explosive evidence. What are they? Read the full story! Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: US private credit firm Golub Capital to set up base in Abu Dhabi

By Federico Maccioni ABU DHABI (Reuters) -U.S.-listed direct lender and private credit manager Golub Capital is opening an office in the UAE's capital Abu Dhabi, it said on Monday, joining dozens of other firms looking to grow their business in the region and deepen ties with its wealth funds. Golub, which had more than $70 billion of capital under management as of Oct. 1, has received preliminary approval for a licence to operate out of the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), the emirate's financial centre, it said in a statement, adding that it had also appointed Naser Almutairi as managing director for the Middle East. "We've had clients in the region for over a decade...We are eager to expand our business and to expand our client service," CEO Lawrence Golub told Reuters in an interview. He said the office is expected to open in January but declined to say how many staff it would have. The presence of sovereign wealth funds, an attractive regulatory environment and an increasing number of high net worth individuals were among the factors influencing the decision, he said. The announcement came as global and regional financiers gathered in the UAE's capital city for the first day of the Abu Dhabi Finance Week annual conference. The emirate, which holds 90% of the UAE's oil reserves, has accelerated efforts to diversify its economy with ADGM striving to become a global hub. Although it trails neighbouring Dubai's DIFC financial centre, ADGM's assets under management reached $157.2 billion by the end of June with firms including the family office of billionaire Ray Dalio and hedge fund Brevan Howard. It is also attracting firms active in private credit, an asset class expected to grow to $2.6 trillion by 2029 from $1.5 trillion at the end of 2023, according to Preqin data, as stricter regulations make it more expensive for traditional lenders to finance riskier loans. Golub, which focuses on middle and upper middle market companies, is planning further investment activities in the Middle East, the CEO said, adding that it was "very seriously" considering applying for a licence in Saudi Arabia, where it saw "big potential", although this would not happen next year.

BlackRock said last week that it would invest about $12 billion to buy private credit firm HPS Investment Partners. Gulf sovereign wealth funds are also expanding in the private credit space, including Abu Dhabi's $330 billion Mubadala, which has forged partnerships with the likes of Apollo and Goldman Sachs in recent years and last week said it would buy a 42% stake in U.S. credit asset manager Silver Rock Financial.

Title: Will Amazon Buy Bitcoin? Shareholders Propose 5% Investment
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/will-amazon-buy-bitcoin-shareholders/
Time Published: 2024-12-09T07:00:02Z
Full Content:
Shareholders of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) have submitted a proposal urging the $2.3 trillion technology conglomerate to consider adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet. The measure, submitted by the National Center for Public Policy Research and slated for discussion at Amazon’s 2025 annual shareholder meeting in April, calls on the company’s Board to assess whether incorporating BTC as a treasury asset would serve the best long-term interests of shareholders. In the proposal, shareholders stress that Amazon’s current treasury management may be insufficient in the face of ongoing inflation. As stated in the submission: “Corporations that invest their assets wisely can – and often do – increase shareholder value more than more profitable businesses that don’t.” According to the supporting materials, Amazon’s current treasury includes approximately $88 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, out of a total $585 billion in assets (as of September 30, 2024). The proposal’s authors argue that inflationary pressures and sub-inflationary bond yields are eroding the purchasing power of these holdings. They cite a US Consumer Price Index (CPI) average annual rate of 4.95% over the past four years, at times peaking at 9.1%, while suggesting that “in reality, the true inflation rate is significantly higher.” Against this backdrop, the submission suggests that Amazon has a “fiduciary duty” to consider inflation-resistant assets. The shareholders point to Bitcoin’s historical returns to bolster their case. They note that as of December 6, 2024, BTC price rose 131% over the previous year, outperforming corporate bonds “by 126% on average.” Over a five-year horizon, Bitcoin’s price increased by 1,246%, surpassing corporate bond returns by an estimated 1,242% during that period. “Amazon should – and perhaps has a fiduciary duty to – consider adding assets to its treasury that appreciate more than bonds, even if those assets are more volatile short-term,” the proposal states. The document also references other publicly listed firms that hold BTC. MicroStrategy, one of the earliest corporate adopters, saw its stock outperform Amazon’s by 537% over the previous year, according to the proposal. In addition, institutional players such as BlackRock and Fidelity—both of which hold significant stakes in Amazon—have introduced Bitcoin-focused investment products for their clients. The shareholders further suggest that U.S. government policy could shift toward a “Bitcoin strategic reserve” by 2025, possibly signaling broader mainstream acceptance. “Shareholders request that the Board conduct an assessment to determine if adding Bitcoin to the Company’s treasury is in the best long-term interests of shareholders,” the proposal concludes. This push at Amazon comes on the heels of a similar initiative at Microsoft. As reported by Bitcoinist, Microsoft (MSF) shareholders are set to vote on December 10 on a proposal to include Bitcoin in its treasury as a reserve asset. However, analysts note that the chances of approval are low after the Microsoft Board recommended a “no” vote. At press time, BTC traded at $99,136. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

That’s according to Sean Dawson, head of research at DeFi derivatives protocol Derive. “We continue to see a 10.5% probability of Ethereum reaching $6,000 and a 6% likelihood for Bitcoin surpassing $150,000 by January 31,” Dawson told Decrypt. “Regarding the 25 delta skews, they've remained stable since last week, showing no significant shifts, Dawson added. “It appears the market has consolidated its position over the weekend.” The 25 delta skew measures the market's bias between calls and puts, and its stability suggests traders' expectations for price direction or risk haven't shifted significantly. It follows Bitcoin’s run above its $100,000 price tag on Wednesday and the significant volatility that followed 12 hours later, which saw the asset dip to an eight-day low of $92,000. Bitcoin’s price has since regained ground, remaining flat on the day at $99,260, CoinGecko data shows. “The weekend usually results in quieter markets and subdued price movements, Dawson explained. Pointing to factors including MicroStrategy flows and BlackRock IBIT options having an outsized impact on Bitcoin’s pricing, Dawson said weekend trading “tends to reduce volatility,” giving the market a “chance to stabilize.” Bitcoin has recaptured the imagination of retail and institutional investors after President-elect Donald Trump clinched a decisive victory in the 2024 elections, held last month. Trump has promised to implement a strategic Bitcoin reserve in the U.S. while protecting the interests of domestic crypto mining firms and those offering industry-related services. Meanwhile, exchange-traded fund flows for major issuers, including BlackRock and Fidelity, continue to post impressive records, with the former rising to become the world’s fastest fund to reach the $50 billion assets under management. “With the market in unchartered territory, we are now in a new price discovery zone,” Singapore-based QCP Capital wrote in a note on Wednesday. “We have returned to a binary scenario, where the spot price could either be driven higher, or selling pressure could push it back below $100,000.

Title: Amazon shareholders urge company to allocate at least 5% of its assets to Bitcoin

Hit your long-term targets. Earn up to 16% per year on digital assets. Share this article A group of Amazon shareholders is pushing for the company to allocate a minimum of 5% of its assets to Bitcoin, through a proposal submitted by the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), a free-market principles advocacy think tank. Source: @TimKotzman The proposal, shared by Tim Kotzman, recommends Bitcoin addition to Amazon’s treasury as a hedge against inflation and asset diversification strategy. It cites Bitcoin’s superior performance compared to traditional assets like corporate bonds, while pointing to existing Bitcoin investments by companies such as MicroStrategy and Tesla. “MicroStrategy, which holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet, has had its stock outperform Amazon stock by 537% in the previous year. And they’re not alone. Institutional and corporate Bitcoin adoption is becoming more commonplace: more public companies such as Tesla and Block have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets, Amazon’s second and fourth largest institutional shareholders—BlackRock and Fidelity, respectively—offer their clients a Bitcoin ETF, and the US government may form a Bitcoin strategic reserve in 2025,” the letter wrote. The proposal calls for Amazon’s board to evaluate whether Bitcoin treasury allocation serves shareholders’ long-term interests. Amazon has not issued a public response to the proposal, though the company has previously demonstrated interest in blockchain technology, particularly in supply chain management. The NCPPR’s proposal is part of a broad institutional push toward Bitcoin adoption. In October, the think tank sent a similar letter to Microsoft urging Bitcoin investment consideration. Microsoft’s board has advised shareholders to vote against their proposal, stating they already consider “a wide range of investable assets,” including Bitcoin. If Microsoft opts against Bitcoin investments and the digital asset’s value subsequently increases, the NCPPR warns it may end up in shareholder litigation. Microsoft shareholders are set to vote on their Bitcoin consideration proposal on December 10. Once a shareholder proposal is filed, Amazon’s board of directors will review it and decide whether to include it in Amazon’s proxy statement for the upcoming annual shareholders meeting. If the proposal is added to the proxy statement, shareholders will vote on it at the annual meeting, scheduled for April 2025. The outcome of the vote will depend on the number of votes in favor of and against the proposal. Similar to Microsoft, the Amazon board of directors typically provides a recommendation on how shareholders should vote regarding each proposal. Top Amazon shareholders include major financial institutions like Vanguard Group, BlackRock, State Street, Fidelity Management & Research, Geode Capital Management, and JPMorgan.

Title: AI Adoption Still in ‘Very Early’ Stages, BlackRock Exec Says

Investment giant BlackRock expects 2025 to be a big year for infrastructure and cybersecurity. And the artificial intelligence (AI) boom will play a major role in those investments, Jay Jacobs, BlackRock’s U.S. head of thematic and active ETFs, told CNBC in a report published Saturday (Dec. 7). “It’s still very early in the AI adoption cycle,” he said. He added that AI firms need to build out their data centers, while protecting that data will likely be a wise investment in the new year. “If you think about your data, you want to spend more on cybersecurity as it gets more valuable,” he said. “We think this is really going to benefit the cybersecurity [and the] software community, which is seeing very rapid revenue growth based off of this AI.” In addition, Jacobs sees a broader impact when it comes to the infrastructure that supports AI. As “magical” as the tech might be, it’s important to remember the physical things — power, chips, real estate — that support it. “It’s not just something that lives in the ether, in the cloud, there’s real physical things that have to happen, and that means energy, that means more materials like copper, that means more real estate. You really have to think about kind of the physical infrastructure that underlies it.” And as PYMNTS wrote last week, this is a costly infrastructure, as running advanced programs requires massive data centers and specialized processors. For example, Microsoft’s partnership with OpenAI required building several AI supercomputers, each powered by thousands of Nvidia A100 GPUs. These installations eat up significant amounts of power, as training a large language model (LLM) can use the same amount of energy as thousands of households. “This pressure has sparked innovation in software architecture,” that report said. “Google has pioneered various optimization techniques, such as quantization, which reduces the precision of numbers required in calculations while maintaining model performance. Meta achieved efficiency gains with its Llama AI models through architectural improvements, allowing smaller models to perform strongly while using fewer parameters.” With this in mind, PYMNTS wrote, major tech companies are racing to shrink their AI systems, marking a major shift in the industry. “The process, known as AI optimization, involves refining complex software systems to improve their performance while reducing the computing power they need to run,” PYMNTS wrote. “These efficiency improvements can transform challenging economics into sustainable operations for companies that rely on massive computing systems.” We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: Jordie Barrett makes try-scoring Leinster debut in Champions Cup win over Bristol

This was a curiously unexceptional game for large tracts of a windy night in Bristol, dominated by the French referee Pierre Brousset and a variety of incomplete or interminable scrums, which seemed like it would never end. Yet it was also truly memorable, not least as a potential sign of more great things to come, when Leinster introduced their A-listers and their ‘A’ game. Jordie Barrett having been introduced during the interval for what would be a quietly outstanding debut, within five minutes Leo Cullen completed probably the best quintet of substitutions in the history of the province, namely Andrew Porter, Thomas Clarkson, RG Snyman and Caelan Doris in addition to Barrett. Jacques Nienaber had warned that Bristol were the kind of team that could score 21 points in 17 minutes, but as it transpired it was Leinster that scored 21 points in a whirlwind six-minute spell. The big hitters were central to this salvo, not least the try-scoring, all-action Barrett, while Sam Prendergast capped off a typically cool night’s work in his first Champions Cup start to bookend that decisive spell with two tries in a 20-minute haul. Yet the night had not been without its difficulties, with Leinster reduced to 13 men, whereupon nobody stood up to be counted more than Josh van der Flier, who maintained his rich form from the Autumn Series with a deserving try of his own in man of the match performance. [ Toulouse run Ulster ragged in statement Champions Cup winOpens in new window ] While the TV pictures might have masked the conditions, there was a steady downpour in the opening quarter which thankfully abated but, in tandem with the swirling after-effects of Storm Darragh, made for a very scrappy opening. On the tightly cropped Ashton Gate surface used by Bristol City, players frequently lost their footing early on. This may also have contributed to the three penalties, and an indirect penalty, against Leinster at scrum time in addition to one in their favour as the typically fastidious and irritating Brousset renewed acquaintances with the ex-Clermont tighthead Rabah Slimani, who will be up against his former team at the Aviva next Saturday (5.30pm). Leinster were possibly a bit too elaborate and overplayed their hand and actually looked more dangerous through their all-or-nothing, fast defensive line speed than when they had the ball. The same was true of Bristol after losing their former Blackrock College product and Connacht Pro12-winning outhalf AJ MacGinty within five minutes when he was almost cut in two by the flying Garry Ringrose. Such were the reverberations from the tackle that MacGinty had to go off for an HIA and did not return. Leinster had survived a couple of five metre lineouts, James Ryan making one good steal, while van der Flier made inroads after a neat short side exchange with Rónan Kelleher before some sleight of hand on the deck went unseen. Prendergast was unlucky that his booming, spiralling 50 metre touch-finder was blown out on the full and when Jack Boyle was pinged for side entry, Kelleher was then binned for a similar offence before Max Deegan followed suit when tripping Fitz Harding in the act of tackling Harry Randall, which was actually quite a trick. Bristol launched Viliame Mata off the next five-metre lineout before Max Lahiff burrowed over and, trailing 7-0, Leinster had another seven minutes to survive with 13 men. But, necessity being the mother of invention, they did more than just survive. They were helped by James Dun spilling the restart, which Jordan Larmour retrieved and, with their numerical disadvantage, Leinster were obliged to be more direct. The fired-up van der Flier, responding to their moments of dire need, carried hard again and Jamison Gibson-Park worked a penalty advantage. Playing with house money, Prendergast chipped deftly and the added bonus was that Rich Lane slid into the ball and slid it into the waiting arms of Larmour who had followed up to gather and score. Prendergast used up the full allotment of time for the conversion and 7-7 at the break was a result for Leinster considering the penalty count was 9-3 against them. As well as the returning Deegan, Leinster welcomed Barrett aboard as a half-time replacement for Ciarán Frawley. Cue the rest of the Bomb Squad. Barrett, employed at inside centre with Robbie Henshaw moving to 13, Ringrose to the right wing and Larmour to the left, immediately made his mark with a good tackle to force a turnover. Yet, there was a little sign of their dramatic input to come initially when Brousset binned both Lahiff and the newly introduced Porter for stepping back when another scrum collapsed and his patience snapped. But, curiously it preceded the defining spell of the match and ironically the Leinster scrum was the platform. From a scrum to the left on the Bristol 22, Gibson-Park fed Barrett and Prendergast looped around to take the pullback and drift through an inviting gap before arcing and dummying to score under the posts. Within two minutes a scrum penalty for Leinster gave them an attacking lineout on the Bristol 22. The ever-alert Gibson-Prink spotted space on the fringe for a telling incision and two phases later Barrett took Gibson-Park’s pass and the Bristol defence bought his dummy as he sliced through himself. The ink barely dry in the referee’s notebook, Leinster struck again with the try of the match. Barrett’s pass had given the visitor’s the width in their own 22 when Doris and Snyman combined deftly to release the secondrow for one of his galloping breaks as he ate up about 40 metres and passed to Prendergast, who fended Randall and carried on from over 40 metes out for his second try. Stunning stuff. Almost funny. The fifth try was more prosaic, a nice launch from a fake maul set-up but a thoroughly deserving score for van der Flier, Prendergast’s conversion completing his 20-point haul. There was a consolation try by the quick-footed Gabriel Ibitoye when latching on to Kieran Marmion’s clever grubber, but the conversion was missed, meaning Leinster maintained their improved defensive record. Jacques Nienaber looked happy too. Scoring sequence: 30 mins: Lahiff try, van Rensburg con 7-0; 33: Larmour try, Prendergast con 7-7; Half-time 7-7; 53: Prendergast try and con 7-14; 56: Barrett try, Prendergast con 7-21; 58: Prendergast try and con 7-28; 65: van der Flier try, Prendergast con 7-35; 73: Ibitoye try 12-35.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Top 10 AI News Stories For The Weekend. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against other top AI news stories for the weekend. Last week, Sam Altman, CEO of AI company OpenAI, expressed his confidence that US President-elect Donald Trump’s administration will support the artificial intelligence sector, ensuring the United States and its allies continue their lead. Altman told US broadcaster Fox News that AI technology needed massive infrastructure support and that Trump would be ideal in providing it. READ ALSO: 15 AI News Updates That Broke The Internet and 15 Buzzing AI Stocks Making Headlines “We need to build that here and we need to be able to have the best AI infrastructure in the world to be able to lead with the technology and the capabilities. I believe President-elect Trump will be very good at that”. Trump has already picked out Silicon Valley venture capitalist David Sacks as his AI and Crypto czar, stating that Sacks will ensure the legal framework for the token has “clarity” to empower the crypto industry to “thrive”. Trump’s decision to appoint Sacks demonstrates his industry-friendly stance toward emerging technologies. “David will focus on making America the clear global leader in both areas. He will safeguard Free Speech online, and steer us away from Big Tech bias and censorship”. Meanwhile, SpaceX founder Elon Musk emerged as a key advisor to Trump after the elections. Musk has also been appointed to co-lead the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which is responsible for streamlining government bureaucracy. Musk having a potential political influence in the administration, particularly when it comes to AI, could get some people worried. However, prominent figures such as Sam Altman say they aren’t. Altman brushed off suggestions that Musk, the owner of X, would use legal tactics to shut down competitors. Matt Calkins, CEO of Appian, is also confident about Musk’s influence on the Trump administration, stating how the influence is positive because Musk “deeply” knows artificial intelligence. The growing momentum of AI, underscored by recent government developments, has brought attention to other key players in the sector, including Anthropic, a leading AI-focused company. Anthropic is collaborating with Amazon to develop one of the world’s most powerful AI supercomputers. The mega-project, codenamed “Project Rainer,” will be five times larger than the cluster used to build Anthropic’s current most advanced model. As reported by WIRED, the announcement was made at the company’s Re:Invent conference in Las Vegas by Matt Garman, CEO of AWS. Once it is completed, the supercomputer will be the world’s largest AI machine featuring hundreds of thousands of its latest Trainium 2 AI training chips. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NYSE:NOW) is a cloud-based platform that leverages AI and machine learning to enable enterprises to streamline workflow automation, enhance IT service management, and optimize other enterprise applications. On December 5, Analyst Michael Turrin of Wells Fargo assigned a “Buy” rating on ServiceNow with a price target of $1,250.00. Gina Mastantuono, company CFO, expressed cautious optimism regarding 2025 IT budgets, indicating potential growth beyond 2024. The company is well-suited to provide clients with both revenue-generating and cost-saving solutions. In particular, ServiceNow’s strong focus on artificial intelligence, predominantly through initiatives such as its early adoption through the Xanadu initiative and the Now Assist platform, puts it on track for future growth. The company’s focus on enhancing customer service through AI and database offerings, including RaptorDB Pro and Knowledge Graph, further emphasizes innovation and efficiency. Lastly, increased operating leverage and ongoing cost efficiencies solidify the buy rating. Overall, NOW ranks 1st on our list of top AI news stories for the weekend. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

We recently compiled a list of the 12 AI News and Ratings Investors Probably Missed. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other AI stocks that investors probably missed. AI is increasingly shaping diverse industries, from healthcare and website design to cybersecurity. Companies are utilizing traditional AI and generative models to improve diagnostics, customer experiences, and business efficiency. While AI offers immense benefits, it also presents new challenges, especially in securing sensitive data.

At the CNBC CFO Council Summit on December 4, Squarespace’s Nathan Gooden, Zoetis’s Wetteny Joseph, and Varonis’s Guy Melamed shared their insights on how artificial intelligence is being integrated into their businesses. From animal health and website development to cybersecurity, these executives discussed the ways AI is improving their operations, improving customer experiences, and addressing emerging challenges. They also explored the evolving role of generative AI and its potential impact on the future of their industries. Wetteny Joseph discussed how AI is being used in animal health, noting the integration of traditional AI in diagnostic platforms for animals, such as a system that quickly analyzes slide images to identify health issues, with potential to expand into human healthcare. Nathan Gooden highlighted the long-standing use of machine learning in the platform, and the incorporation of generative AI to simplify the website design process for customers. Guy Melamed mentioned AI’s dual impact: improving customer protection while also presenting risks, such as exposing sensitive data via AI tools like co-pilot. His company focuses on securing data and preventing unauthorized access through these AI systems. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

It integrates AI across its products to improve business processes and development and invests in AI technologies through partnerships. OpenAI is considering removing a provision that would prevent Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) from accessing its most advanced models once the company achieves artificial general intelligence (AGI), as per The Financial Times. Currently, the provision prohibits Microsoft from using AGI technology, which could limit the value of its partnership with OpenAI, especially given Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) significant investment of over $13 billion. OpenAI is restructuring to become a public benefit corporation and is discussing new terms with investors, including Microsoft. Overall, MSFT ranks 2nd on our list of the AI stocks that investors probably missed. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Why Schlumberger Limited (SLB) is the Best Fuel Stock to Buy Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 8 Best Fuel Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB) stands against other best fuel stocks to buy now. Fuel stocks, often referred to as energy stocks, represent shares of companies involved in the exploration and development of oil and gas reserves, as well as those specializing in drilling for these resources. Additionally, companies that refine crude oil into usable products, such as gasoline and diesel, also fall under this category. In an interview with Bloomberg on December 5, Amrita Sen, Founder and Director of Research at Energy Aspects, discussed the current state of the oil market and the upcoming OPEC+ meeting. Sen noted that OPEC+ members are unlikely to increase production, given the traditional maintenance season in Q1 and Q2, which typically leads to crude stock builds. Instead, she expects the group to delay the planned output to effectively get rid of the seasonal builds and reassess the market in the second half of the year. Sen highlighted that the current state of global inventories is incredibly low and that in the US, inventories are expected to end the year below 420 million barrels, which is at their lowest since 2007. Despite this, oil prices have been stuck at a low price, as analysts and industries are expecting a bearish 2025 and are discounting their current inventories When asked about the risk of a serious breakdown in OPEC+ members, Sen said that it is unlikely to happen as the members are committed to maintain a stable price, rather than engaging in a price war. She recalled the price war in April 2020, which led to a decline in prices, and said that OPEC ministers want to avoid a repeat of that scenario. While they do want prices to be higher, they also realize that if there is a breakdown and the market is not managed properly, prices can also go lower.

Sen agreed that the recent commencement of Canadian oil shipments to international markets via the Trans Mountain pipeline represents a significant development in the industry and has enabled Canadian producers to benefit from increased access to global markets. Sen notes that China has a strong preference for Canadian heavy oil, primarily due to its consistent quality, which is well-suited to the requirements of modern Chinese refineries. Sen also said that all the new refineries coming online in China, India, and other South Asian countries are primarily designed to process medium or heavy sour crude oil, and its demand is projected to reach a net 800,000 barrels per day. Sen pointed out that the refining capacity in regions such as Europe, North America, and other OECD countries is expected to decline, with a projected loss of 1 million barrels per day during the next year, comprising 400,000 barrels in Europe and an additional 400,000 in the United States, due to environmental concerns. Looking ahead to 2025, Sen expects the average oil price to average around $80 for Brent, but there are risks skewed to the upside due to the possible tightening of sanctions on Iran, Venezuela, and Russia under the Trump administration. Energy plays a crucial role in the global economy, as it provides the essential resources needed to power industries, transportation, and homes. The oil and gas industry continues to play a pivotal role in meeting the world’s energy needs, even as the push for cleaner alternatives gains momentum. To compile our list of the 8 best fuel stocks to buy now, we used Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to find the 25 largest companies in the oil and gas sectors. We then used Insider Monkey’s Hedge Fund database to rank 8 stocks according to the largest number of hedge fund holders, as of Q3 2024. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). An aerial view of a well site, depicting the scale of oil and gas operations. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 65 Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB) is the world’s largest oilfield services company, delivering advanced technology and expertise to oil and gas operators worldwide. The company plays a crucial role in the industry by providing drilling, exploration, and production solutions to major clients, including ExxonMobil and Chevron. Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB) is collaborating with next-generation companies to scale up technologies and make them accessible to its network of clients and customers. The company is partnering with ILiAD to scale up direct lithium extraction (DLE) technology. This technology has a significantly smaller physical footprint, reduced carbon emissions, and lower water usage compared to traditional lithium extraction methods. In Q3, Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB) reported a 10% year-over-year revenue increase, reaching $9.16 billion. This growth was driven by a 31% year-over-year revenue surge in its Production Systems segment to $3.1 billion and an 11% year-over-year rise in digital and integration revenue, fueled by the adoption of AI-powered tools and digital solutions. Regional growth was led by Europe & Africa and the Middle East & Asia, both recording 16% year-over-year revenue increases, while North America experienced modest growth of 3% year-over-year. Overall, SLB ranks 4th on our list of best fuel stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of SLB to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than SLB but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Clontarf end Ballynahinch’s winning run in AIL with dominant display
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2024/12/08/clontarf-end-ballynahinchs-winning-run-in-ail-with-dominant-display/
Time Published: 2024-12-08T16:11:49Z
Full Content:
Far from being another tight arm wrestle, a strong Clontarf selection made something of a statement when ending the five-match winning run of leaders Ballynahinch at Ballymacarn Park with a 32-12 bonus-point win. By contrast, there was again late drama aplenty in the other four Division 1A games, which were decided by margins of four points or fewer. Storm Darragh’s slipstream ensured the wind was a significant factor throughout Saturday’s AIL programme, which almost survived intact. Clontarf laid the foundations into the first-half wind to lead 3-0 at half-time before maximising the elements. Tadgh Bird, whose move from fullback has helped to fill the Matt D’Arcy midfield void, crashed over for ‘Tarf’s first try before Conor Kelly scored off his own chip. Ballynahinch, missing some of their Ulster contingent, responded with Ethan Graham’s try before Aitzol King’s intercept try and after another for the hosts by Ronan McCusker, Bird took his seasonal tally to six when scoring for the fourth game running to clinch the bonus point. Newly promoted St Mary’s went top with a hard-earned 26-24 win over Young Munster at Templeville Road. St Mary’s led 12-0 through tries by Tom O’Reilly and Myles Carey, before tries by Manuel Covella, Shane O’Leary and Oisín Pepper, the latter with a fine chip and chase, put Munster 17-12 ahead only for Michael Silvester’s try to leave the home side 19-17 ahead at the break. Munster led through Covella’s second try before Dan Goggin finished off a multiphase attack against his old club and Conor Hayes, another ex-Munster man, landed the winning conversion from the touchline in the swirling wind. Terenure remain fourth after playing a get-out-of-jail card at a blowy Bowl. They led 21-17 when Conor Phillips’ intercept try augmented first-half scores by Craig Adams and Alan Bennie but UCD, stacked with eight Leinster academy players, looked likely winners after Conor Ó Tighearnaigh’s bonus-point try put them 24-21 ahead. Levi Vaughan made inroads off an overthrow before Chris Cosgrave levelled with a wind-assisted penalty from inside halfway and after the restart went out on the full, Harrison Brewer’s charge up the middle was deliberately knocked on for Cosgrave to land the winning penalty with the game’s last kick. Con remain fifth after a hard-earned 19-17 win away to a game Garryowen side with a number of Munster academy players. Two Brian Gleeson tries and a Dylan Hicks penalty had Garryowen 17-14 in front but Con, who had scored first-half tries through Scott Buckley, after three successive penalties off lineout mauls, and a well-worked try by the recalled Matthew Bowen, won courtesy of a late penalty try from another catch-and-drive. It was awarded by American referee Lee Wiener, who had earlier sinbinned two Con players for high hits. Similarly, both sides played better into the wind at the Palace Grounds, where Lansdowne prevailed by 19-15 over City of Armagh thanks to Andy Marks’ sixth try of the season, a timely fillip before hosting leaders on the Aviva back pitch next Friday night. Men’s Division 1A: Garryowen 17 Cork Constitution 19; Ballynahinch 12 Clontarf 32; City of Armagh 15 Lansdowne 19; St. Mary’s College 26 Young Munster 24; UCD 24 Terenure College 27. Division 1B: Blackrock College 25 UCC 5; Highfield 17 Queens 35; Nenagh Ormond 19 Naas 18; Old Belvedere 39 Shannon 24; Old Wesley 38 Dublin University 17.

We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI News Taking Wall Street by Storm. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks that are taking Wall Street by storm. It seems that major tech companies in Silicon Valley are forging relationships with the defense industry these days. In the latest news, prominent artificial intelligence company OpenAI has entered a partnership with Anduril, a defense startup that produces missiles, drones, and software for the United States military. READ NOW: 15 AI News Updates That Broke The Internet and 15 AI News Investors Shouldn’t Miss. The companies said that this partnership will emphasize on the improvement of the United States' counter-unmanned aircraft systems (CUAS) as well as their ability to deal with potentially lethal aerial threats in real-time. The CUAS will enable defense against drone strikes by detecting and intercepting them while they are airborne. According to Brian Schimpf, cofounder and CEO of Anduril, OpenAI’s AI models will be used to improve systems used for air defense. The technology will be used to “assess drone threats more quickly and accurately, giving operators the information they need to make better decisions while staying out of harm’s way”, revealed a former OpenAI employee. “OpenAI builds AI to benefit as many people as possible, and supports US-led efforts to ensure the technology upholds democratic values… Our partnership with Anduril will help ensure OpenAI technology protects US military personnel, and will help the national security community understand and responsibly use this technology to keep our citizens safe and free.” Last month, OpenAI rival Anthropic also entered a partnership with a famous defense contractor to provide “US intelligence and defense agencies” access to its AI models. Regardless of its competitors' actions, OpenAI shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon. After months of tender offers and a soaring valuation, the company has reached a new record of 300 million weekly active users. The announcement was made by Sam Altman during an appearance at The New York Times’ Dealbook Conference on Wednesday, December 4th. The company is reportedly targeting 1 billion active users by next year. These strategies aim to strengthen OpenAI's position against competitors Anthropic and Elon Musk’s xAI, the latter of which Sam Altman considers a “fierce competitor”. Besides that, it is also striving to gain a larger slice of the generative AI market, which may top $1 trillion in revenue by the next decade. Altman also revealed that his company hasn’t asked investors not to invest in its competitors. However, those who decide to wouldn’t have access to OpenAI’s “information rights,” like the company’s roadmap and other materials. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.

A wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 158 Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has fortified its mark in the AI realm with the launch of Apple Intelligence, its personal artificial intelligence system. On December 6, Bloomberg reported that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is gearing up to launch one of its most-awaited projects: the series of cellular modem chips that aim to replace components from long-time partner and rival Qualcomm. Reportedly, Apple’s in-house modem system will debut next spring. This technology is said to be part of the iPhone SE, the company’s entry-level smartphone. The iPhone SE will be updated next year for the first time since 2022. When the iPhone SE debuts in a few months, it is going to have new features such as Apple Intelligence and the edge-to-edge screen design already used in more upscale models. However, the breakthrough is going to be its in-house modem, code-named Sinope. Currently, the modem won’t be used in Apple’s higher-end products but is set to come to a new mid-tier iPhone later next year, code-named D23. Apple’s entry-level iPads will also witness the chip debut as early as 2025. Overall AAPL ranks 1st on our list of the AI stocks that are taking Wall Street by storm. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 56 International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is a multinational technology company and a pioneer in artificial intelligence, offering AI consulting services and a suite of AI software products. On December 3, IBM announced a global collaboration with the recognized defense intelligence company Janes to bridge the gap within defense organizations that exists due to a lack of trust in AI systems and their outputs. The collaboration integrates open-source defense and security intelligence data into IBM’s Watsonx, a trusted AI and data platform. Defense leaders will be able to access high-quality data combined with trusted AI, improving their decision-making abilities. This will be done by integrating IBM Watsonx AI and data platform, utilizing an IBM Granite model with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern with Janes data. In turn, the RAG pattern will allow operational decision support, and assistance in military and intelligence analysts by generating comprehensive, data-augmented reports for situational analysis and decision-making. Moreover, AI-assisted scenario modeling and retrieval-augmented data analysis will allow more informed mission planning. Overall IBM ranks 4th on our list of the AI stocks that are taking Wall Street by storm. While we acknowledge the potential of IBM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

The technology will be used to “assess drone threats more quickly and accurately, giving operators the information they need to make better decisions while staying out of harm’s way”, revealed a former OpenAI employee. “OpenAI builds AI to benefit as many people as possible, and supports US-led efforts to ensure the technology upholds democratic values… Our partnership with Anduril will help ensure OpenAI technology protects US military personnel, and will help the national security community understand and responsibly use this technology to keep our citizens safe and free.” Last month, OpenAI rival Anthropic also entered a partnership with a famous defense contractor to provide “US intelligence and defense agencies” access to its AI models. Regardless of its competitors' actions, OpenAI shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon. After months of tender offers and a soaring valuation, the company has reached a new record of 300 million weekly active users. The announcement was made by Sam Altman during an appearance at The New York Times’ Dealbook Conference on Wednesday, December 4th. The company is reportedly targeting 1 billion active users by next year. These strategies aim to strengthen OpenAI's position against competitors Anthropic and Elon Musk’s xAI, the latter of which Sam Altman considers a “fierce competitor”. Besides that, it is also striving to gain a larger slice of the generative AI market, which may top $1 trillion in revenue by the next decade. Altman also revealed that his company hasn’t asked investors not to invest in its competitors. However, those who decide to wouldn’t have access to OpenAI’s “information rights,” like the company’s roadmap and other materials.

Bitcoin has seen its price climb back over $100,000 this week after bouncing wildly around the closely-watched level, with the chief executive of Wall Street's biggest market maker admitting he's got "FOMO."

The bitcoin price has more than doubled this year as a perfect storm hits the crypto market—with traders now braced for a game-changer this week. Now, as Tesla billionaire Elon Musk's campaign against the spiraling $36 trillion debt pile spurs calls for a U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve, the U.S. Treasury has named bitcoin "digital gold" in a report.

[+] Treasury amid a bitcoin price boom. The "primary use case for bitcoin seems to be a store of value aka 'digital gold' in a decentralized finance (DeFi) world; speculative interest seems to have played a prominent role in the growth of digital tokens thus far," the report authors wrote. Last month, U.S. president-elect Donald Trump nominated Scott Bessent, a hedge fund manager known for his pro-bitcoin and crypto stance, to be the next secretary of the Treasury. In July, Trump promised to create a "strategic national bitcoin reserve" and predicted bitcoin could eclipse gold's $16 trillion market capitalization during an appearance at the Bitcoin 2024 conference. "I think that everything is on the table with bitcoin," Bessent said following Trump's bitcoin reserve proposal. Earlier this week, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said bitcoin was comparable to gold during the New York Times' DealBook conference. "It’s just like gold only it’s virtual," Powell said. "People are not using it as a form of payment, or as a store of value. It’s highly volatile. It’s not a competitor for the dollar, it’s really a competitor for gold." Bitcoin has seen its price rocket as its embraced as digital gold by the likes of BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, and bitcoin-buying juggernaut MicroStrategy. "The U.S. Treasury just declared that bitcoin is digital gold and yet some people still think $100,000 bitcoin is too expensive," Dennis Porter, whose Satoshi Action Fund has helped draft a number of state-level bitcoin and crypto rights bills, posted to X.

Title: Ethereum ETFs see record $844 mln inflows – Will this boost ETH’s December targets?

Here are key ETH price targets options traders are eyeing in December 2024 and January 2025. Last week, the U.S. spot Ethereum [ETH] ETFs hit their largest weekly inflows since launch. According to SpotOnChain data, the products logged five consecutive days of inflows totaling $844 million. Over the same period, the highest daily inflows hit $428.5 million, led by BlackRock and Fidelity. The strong flows and demand fueled ETH value to hit $4K for the first time since March 2024. Source: SpotOnChain The remarkable performance was a complete turnaround from the products’ lackluster launch in July. How far can the strong inflows boost ETH value? Source: Deribit Options traders weren’t surprised by the $4K hit last week. They had expected it, with nearly $660M in notional value betting on ETH hitting that level. So, what are they eyeing next? According to Deribit data, other price targets with high OI (open interest) rates were $4.5K, $5K, and $6K. Significant bets were also placed on the $8K level. About $374 million was being placed on a $5K target. The $6K and $4.5K saw $353M and $348.5M worth of notional value on call options (bullish bets), respectively. In short, options traders were confident that ETH would reach $5K and $6K price targets. For December, $4.5K and $5K were reachable, but the $6K milestone was expected from January 2025. Rising market interest, as shown by a spike in ETH’s active addresses, also supported the options market’s bullish outlook. Source: CryptoQuant Since October lows, ETH’s monthly active addresses have increased from below 300K to over 380K as of this writing. If the bullish market sentiment continues, the increased market interest could increase ETH prices. Read Ethereum [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-2025 That said, ETH consolidated below $4K at press time. On the price charts, the next key Fib levels marched the options traders’ targets. The $4.5K and $5K were immediate upside levels, while $3.6K was a key support.

Title: Ethereum Surge Coming? Analyst Eyes $16,000 Milestone Within 2 Years

Ethereum (ETH) continues to spark bullish talk in the cryptoverse, as well known analysts see large price moves ahead. According to Venture Founder, Ethereum is forming a rising three-year triangle pattern, which could set the stage for a possible breakout. Based on similar comparisons to data from 2016-2017, the altcoin will hit $15,937, probably by May of 2025. Such a rise would take Ethereum’s market capitalization beyond $1 trillion, a historic first for the blockchain behemoth. Analysts view a weekly close above $3,800 as a significant milestone. From there, Ethereum might aim for its all-time high of $4,878 before moving on to higher grounds. But is the market prepared for this upswing? This $ETH breakout out of the triangle consolidation is very significant. Now #Ethereum only has to close this weekly candle bullish, and we may never revisit this sub $4,000 level again in this bull cycle. The impulse move from 2016-2017 is repeating. PT: $15,937 by May 2025 pic.twitter.com/dNzcO3mPe1 — venturefounder (@venturefounder) December 6, 2024 More institutions are becoming interested in Ethereum, which makes people more optimistic about its long-term prospects. Spot Bitcoin ETFs got a lot of attention at the beginning of the year, and now Ethereum-based funds are following suit. Notably, since the middle of November, spot Ether ETFs have gotten more than $1.3 billion in fresh inflows. The iShares Ethereum Trust from BlackRock has made the most returns, $500 million in just one week. Beyond just numbers, these investments show a rising trust in the Ethereum ecosystem. According to analysts, this institutional funding flow will pave the way for ETH’s anticipated meteoric rise. With institutional investors continuing to pour money into the cryptocurrency, Ethereum’s value proposition as a long-term investment appears stronger than ever. The recent weeks’ price behavior of Ethereum has also been rather favorable. Following a little setback, the altcoin has recovered, climbing 30% starting in November 18. With analysts underlining its resilience against market swings, it is trading at $3,686 right now, which is a solid figure. Technical markers of consolidation point to ETH getting ready for its next action. Moving averages show stability, hence the Relative Strength Index (RSI) stays neutral. Forecasts show ETH perhaps rising by 43% in six months and 22% in three months, data from CoinCheckup shows. The signals point favorably even though Ethereum’s route to reach $15,937 is undetermined. With favorable technical conditions, institutional inflows, and strong ecosystem development, the altcoin is primed for major increases.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: How to be more Danish this Christmas: A mismatched table and absolutely no matching pyjamas

If you don’t already know Nordic Elements, Helle Moyna’s shop in the village of Blackrock, Co Dublin, you should make the journey, to browse and to be beguiled. The shop has a reputation for high-end furniture but every surface is adorned with smaller potential gifts – ornaments and objects priced to suit every pocket, from €10 wooden spoons to books on design, via mugs and vases. Then there’s lighting and, of course, sofas to sink into. The approach taken to decor in Nordic Elements is reflected in Moyna’s home in nearby Booterstown. She is a fan of Christmas but don’t expect to see any glitter or snowglobes or tinsel in her house. While growing up in Jutland, Denmark, where people would always spend money on their homes, she says, the mantra was: “Buy well, buy less.” “We wouldn’t go out to eat much. We would entertain at home – cosy, nice furniture, nice accessories,” she recalls. The essence of hygge, the calm interior of Moyna’s home is understated, and yet there is something in every corner that draws the eye – from ceramics, collected on holidays, to gifts from a son’s girlfriend. Every object tells a story and all have become the building blocks of a home – one to which you’d relish an invitation. For Moyna, December is a particularly lovely period. To get in to the festive spirit, as she puts it, she has adorned the impressive entrance to her home with “an oversized wreath, with all kinds of foliage – eucalyptus, pinecones, pink and burgundy ribbons”. “It is illuminated by battery-operated lights,” she enthuses. “I get some help from Ruth Monaghan of Appassionata Flowers.” Lights thread through the railings out front too, and a miniature pine tree in a pot at the front door is similarly illuminated. Inside, on the hall return, a miniature tree draws the eye upwards; it and the Christmas trees – yes, trees, plural – are tastefully dressed in white lights. The star is the tree in the main livingroom, the grown-up room, as Moyna calls it; that one is always a real tree, she says. “I never saw a fake tree until I moved to London in my 20s.” It was in the UK capital that Moyna met her husband, David, from Scotstown in Co Monaghan. Her preference for a Christmas tree is Nordmann fir, an evergreen conifer with good symmetry – and “not too wide at the bottom” – which she orders from Kavanagh’s Christmas Farm at Glendarragh in Newtown Mount Kennedy, Co Wicklow. “They know what I want,” she says. “In Denmark we put live candles on trees. The first time my husband saw it he thought we were nuts. My dad is old school – that’s what we do. His tree comes the day before Christmas Eve.” The tree lights are still; no flickering, no colours. Hanging from the closers on all the livingroom’s large sash windows are big brass stars festooned with micro-lights. “It means there’s light in the windows even if we close the shutters.” A silver tray, bought in Lebanon on honeymoon, forms the base to a series of pillar candles, Moynagh’s Advent wreath, where she lights a candle each Sunday in Advent. She listens to music or podcasts as she decorates and enjoys the moment. “Life is busy. We don’t have enough time to potter.” Across the hall, in the family room, her sons, Tobias and Marcus, now 19 and 17 respectively, have always had a tree of their own that they decorate with all their stuff, as she puts it. “They open a huge box, close the door, put on Christmas music and decorate. The first year they did it they were just seven and five and they only decorated one side of the tree. It has loads of colour, although they didn’t decorate it last year as they were in Denmark.” [ How to establish your own interior design styleOpens in new window ] Given her sons’ ages, Moyna wasn’t sure the tradition would continue. But when the “boys” heard she was decorating the house early to give The Irish Times a sneak preview, they went out and got a tree of their own. It is as stylishly presented as their mum’s, with a classic red-and-white colour scheme. The dining table is set into bay windows that overlook the family’s large garden; here, beaded hearts hang from the window closers in the same fashion as the formal livingroom. She spotted the table at the last auction held by Adams in Blackrock; the steel pedestal base was visible but the teak tabletop was hidden from view by about an inch of varnish and a glass covering, as well as many other items for sale. It is relatively low-set, with three different kinds of stemware – “I like to set a mismatched table,” says Moyna. She uses living foliage to create maximum impact – keeping things “fragrant and simple”. Simple, yes, but highly effective – and stylish touches such as curling a long stem of fresh eucalyptus around a scrolled napkin and tying it in a knot are easy to replicate. Instead of putting a big bunch of flowers at the centre of the table, only for it to be moved elsewhere when the time comes to serve dinner, Moyna populates it with single-bud vases containing hyacinth bulbs and a centrepiece candelabra. “It’s about reusing stuff. It’s creative, relaxed and less formal,” she says. You could do something similar by putting short stems into low jars and bottles and tying a ribbon around them to add a flourish of colour. It is decor as an icebreaker. Elsewhere, the house stays as it usually is. This is not a Christmas pyjamas for all the family-type household, she says. She also says no to festive-motif bedding, yuletide towels in the bathrooms or Christmas-themed cushions. What type of Christmas personality does she have? “I really enjoy entertaining at home. I would rather have people over than eat out. I know it’s work but I have developed shortcuts over the years. I really relax cooking. I enjoy it. If I want help, I’ll ask for it.” Introduce art and wonderful scents combined to your home with ceramicist Bela Silva’s fragranced candles for Serax.

He’s an emergency physician and CEO of Starbot. We’re going to talk about the current state of Bitcoin and digital assets. Noah, welcome back to the show. Noah Kaufman: Kevin, thank you. I guess this is our third talk now. Kevin Pho: We have you on every year, and Bitcoin is at a different price every time we talk. Last night was a historic event—it broke $100,000. Before we get into anything, for those who may not be familiar with Bitcoin and digital assets, what does $100,000 for one Bitcoin mean to you? Noah Kaufman: Yeah, you know, it’s a milestone. It’s a stepping stone. It’s hard to talk about something exponential without being hyperbolic, right? On your podcast, we’ve been telling physicians—or, well, I was kind of pounding the table way back in 2019. Just because of the Sharpe ratio and the amazing adoption of this new monetary network, Bitcoin at $100,000 is kind of a stepping stone. When I say it’s hard not to be hyperbolic, I mean that some people are going crazy celebrating, but really, this is ultimately a multimillion-dollar asset. And, you know, we’re just getting started. It’s still extremely early—a very small number of people own Bitcoin or understand what it is. Believe it or not, I think $100,000 is not that big of a deal. It was expected. It was expected when I started buying it at hundreds of dollars, then at $10,000, and now $100,000. And now I expect $1 million, several million, and probably, in the next 20 years, there’s a good chance we’ll get to $10 million. I know that sounds crazy, but it’s hard to understand something exponential, growing by Metcalfe’s Law, that is so novel and so important for humanity. Kevin Pho: Well, tell us, what is Metcalfe’s Law? Noah Kaufman: Sure. Metcalfe’s Law describes the value of networks. For every participant in that network, the value of the network increases exponentially. The larger a network becomes, the more valuable it becomes exponentially. Of course, there’s a mathematical equation and a lot of research behind Metcalfe’s Law, but in a nutshell, that’s the lay version. We see it with Facebook and Amazon. Social networks are valued by the number of users and monetized through advertising or other means. That’s how Facebook makes its money. A monetary network, like the U.S. dollar system, has its value intrinsically tied to the value of each unit. Each participant makes the system more valuable. There’s been no network in history that has reached an inflation-adjusted $100 million market cap and failed. That’s never happened. Right now, we’re at a $2 trillion market cap for Bitcoin. We’re way beyond sustainability. Now there are ETFs, and there’s talk about a strategic Bitcoin reserve. If that happens, things will go crazy. Metcalfe’s Law is part of the reason why the Bitcoin network is so valuable, whether you agree with it or think it’s a scam. The fact of the matter is, all money systems are Ponzi schemes. This is a big legal Ponzi. It’s crazy, but all it takes is belief, political adoption, and legal adoption. We have that now with ETFs. It’s been de-risked. Compared to the last time we talked, the value of the network has gone up substantially because the risk has been taken away. Kevin Pho: So, we started off this year with Bitcoin in the $30,000 range. Now, it has broken $100,000 per Bitcoin. What were some of the triggers that led to its rise this year? Noah Kaufman: Certainly, the adoption of Bitcoin in the ETF world played a huge role. BlackRock—we all know BlackRock is holding hands with the United States government—gave more than a tacit approval of Bitcoin. Once money managers and Wall Street got into Bitcoin, it really changed the game. It takes a long time for pension funds and other large funds to be able to buy Bitcoin. Many of them won’t even buy it until it hits the $100,000 mark—that’s a mandate for a lot of pension funds. There are countless trillions of dollars sitting on the sidelines in debt markets, looking for places to invest. Bitcoin is going to be a recipient of some of that capital—quite a bit of it, actually. This is due to the Sharpe ratio, which measures risk-adjusted returns. Bitcoin has returned 147 percent CAGR (compounded annual growth rate) over the last 14 years. It’s the best-performing asset of all time. It was the most-bought ETF of all time by far, dwarfing gold ETFs. Bitcoin is demonetizing precious metals and taking their place because it’s technologically superior. It’s completely finite, with 21 million Bitcoins scheduled to exist—94 percent of which have already been created. That means only 6 percent of Bitcoins are left to be mined for eternity. Every four years, the number of Bitcoins mined is cut in half. This is an absolutely scarce, inelastic supply running straight into an ever-expanding demand. From the early days, I’ve argued that this is such an asymmetric bet with such a great Sharpe ratio for your portfolio. More return for less risk—that’s what the Sharpe ratio tells you. I’ve said, “Why not put 1 percent of your net worth as a physician into it?” Myself and a bunch of friends started doing that when Bitcoin was $3,000, and now most of us are retired. We work because we want to. I’ve got a ton of Bitcoin, and I feel bad for those listening to White Coat Investor because they’ve been told, “This is horrible. This is bad.” But studies show that putting an asset with a high Sharpe ratio into your portfolio—even at a small percentage—can yield outsized returns for minimal risk. That’s always been the argument. Whether or not you believe in Bitcoin, you need to be agnostic if you want to act as a fiduciary for your family and financial situation. It’s still extremely early. Bitcoin is going to reach $1 million, then multi-millions per coin. I know it’s hard to believe, but this is exponential adoption. If you look at the chart, it’s a parabola. We’re right here, and it’s going up. You can’t think of it like a stock. It’s a new monetary system—an egalitarian one. Kevin Pho: Wrapping back to your earlier point, yes, the ETFs were a trigger. But what about global influences, like El Salvador or the Saudis? How do they play a role? Noah Kaufman: Absolutely. El Salvador adopting Bitcoin was a huge moment. There are also rumors that the Saudis are buying Bitcoin. Just yesterday, Putin made statements that likely pushed it over $100,000. He hinted that Bitcoin is an important world asset, and nobody can control it. Then there’s Trump. For better or worse, as president, he’s now talking about creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve and buying a million Bitcoin. If that happens, other countries will think, “Oh no, we better get some Bitcoin.” It’s a self-fulfilling process. This is why it’s crucial to remain agnostic. Bitcoin is a new, uncorrelated asset class. Yes, it’s volatile, but it’s volatile while going straight up, unlike fiat currency. With fiat currency, if you have $1 million today, in five to seven years, it will only have the purchasing power of $500,000. You need to invest to protect your wealth. Even if you invest in the S&P, you face currency risk and inflation. Sure, maybe you made 12 percent CAGR, but after inflation, what’s your real return? It’s like Pascal’s wager: even if you don’t believe in Bitcoin, the smart thing to do is to buy a little, just in case it catches on. Kevin Pho: You mentioned White Coat Investor earlier. For the record, I’m a big fan of White Coat Investor and the work they’ve done to bring physician financial literacy into the mainstream. But not just White Coat Investor—if you read finance articles in the New York Times or Washington Post, they aren’t as enthusiastic as you are. Why do you think that is? Noah Kaufman: First, let me say that White Coat Investor has been a net positive for physicians. I’ve learned a lot from them, and while we’ve had disagreements, I really respect Jim and everything he’s built. That said, I think he got it wrong on Bitcoin. When something is outside the current paradigm, it threatens existing power structures. Most people are conservative and prefer to stay safe within the status quo. Back when we first talked about Bitcoin, there wasn’t an ETF. Regulation from the SEC was a concern, and it was viewed as risky. Now, though, it’s different. Even Jerome Powell, the Fed chair, recently said that Bitcoin isn’t a competitor to the U.S. dollar. It’s a speculative asset and a competitor to gold. I agree—it’s a much better form of gold. If it reaches gold’s market cap, each Bitcoin would be worth $913,000. The opportunity here is to invest in something before everyone else recognizes its value. It’s like buying Amazon, Netflix, or Apple stock in the early 2000s. Nobel-winning economist Paul Krugman famously said in the ’90s that the internet would be a passing fad and wouldn’t contribute meaningfully to GDP. Clearly, that was wrong. Investments like these are about seeing value before others do. That’s why I recommend putting a small percentage—1 percent, maybe 5 percent if you’re bold—of your portfolio into Bitcoin. If you lose 5 percent of your portfolio, it’s not the end of the world. But if that 5 percent grows tenfold, it could become a significant portion of your portfolio. Kevin Pho: That makes sense. You’ve touched on how Bitcoin fits into a portfolio and why its Sharpe ratio is attractive. But let’s talk about trust. There were significant losses with platforms like FTX and Voyager. How has that impacted Bitcoin adoption? Noah Kaufman: That’s a great point. The failures of centralized custodians like FTX and Voyager were devastating. I personally lost over 40 Bitcoin on Voyager. It was painful. Luckily, I’ve rebuilt my holdings, but it was a harsh lesson. These losses made one thing clear: self-custody is essential when it comes to Bitcoin. Even with platforms like Coinbase, I wouldn’t fully trust them for long-term storage. The mantra in the Bitcoin world is, “Not your keys, not your coins.” If you don’t hold the private keys to your Bitcoin, you don’t truly own it. That said, while retail adoption has slowed due to these setbacks, institutional adoption has surged. Many retail investors got burned by platforms like Celsius, BlockFi, and FTX, and they’ve been hesitant to come back. It’s a “once bitten, twice shy” situation. However, institutions like Wall Street have been accumulating during this time, taking advantage of the lower prices. Now, Bitcoin is primed for its next big move, and we’re seeing the effects of that. Kevin Pho: With Bitcoin now surpassing $100,000, some may wonder if it’s too late for physicians to invest. What’s your perspective on that? Noah Kaufman: It’s definitely not too late. In fact, it’s still very early. Bitcoin follows mathematically defined cycles, which are volatile by nature. You’ll see 30 percent rises followed by 20 percent drops, or 50 percent gains followed by 10 percent pullbacks. It moves in stair-step patterns. Right now, we’re over $100,000, but it wouldn’t surprise me if Bitcoin dropped to $70,000 in a few weeks. People would then declare, “See? It’s failing; it’s a Ponzi scheme.” But shortly after, it might surge to $180,000. That’s how Bitcoin works. Its supply is extremely inelastic, and its demand keeps growing. Nation-states are buying it. Institutions are buying it. This dynamic creates an upward pressure on price over time. Sure, there will be corrections, but the long-term trajectory is up. For physicians, the idea is to allocate a small, speculative percentage of your net worth—1 to 5 percent—to Bitcoin. It’s not about day trading or trying to time the market. Bitcoin is something you buy and hold for the long term. If you buy now and hold for several years, the potential upside is significant. Kevin Pho: You mentioned earlier that Bitcoin could play a role in private practice or medical group balance sheets. Can you elaborate on that? Noah Kaufman: Absolutely. I consult with private practices and medical groups on this topic. There are ways to structure investments into Bitcoin legally and strategically. For example, instead of distributing 100 percent of profits as bonuses or reinvesting in traditional ways, practices could allocate a small percentage—say 5 percent—of their funds into Bitcoin. Holding Bitcoin on the balance sheet offers several benefits. First, there are favorable tax implications depending on how the investment is structured. Second, it diversifies the group’s financial strategy. Even if Bitcoin’s price remains stable, the potential for outsized returns over time makes it a compelling option. For practices, this is a way to strengthen financial resilience while taking advantage of an emerging asset class. It’s a no-brainer to allocate a small percentage to Bitcoin. Of course, there are legal and accounting considerations, but I help groups navigate those complexities. Kevin Pho: Shifting gears a bit, let’s talk about how financial freedom impacts the physician lifestyle. You’ve mentioned that financial security has changed how you approach medicine. Can you share more about that? Noah Kaufman: Sure. When I started practicing medicine 20 years ago, finances weren’t as much of a concern. Physician salaries felt sufficient, and the administrative burden was lower. Today, it’s a different story. I recently spoke with a couple—a pediatrician and an ophthalmologist—who have $900,000 in student loans at a 7 percent interest rate. That’s crushing. Combine that with rising administrative demands, decreasing reimbursements, and inflation, and many young physicians feel stuck. Financial stress leads to burnout, compassion fatigue, and physician depression. It’s hard to provide great care when you’re overwhelmed by financial pressures. That’s where financial literacy and tools like Bitcoin come in. They empower physicians to take control of their finances, reduce debt, and find a better work-life balance. For me, I now practice medicine because I enjoy it, not because I have to. I work five or six days a month and spend the rest of my time rock climbing, riding motorcycles, or just enjoying life. This balance makes me a better physician and a happier person overall. Kevin Pho: We’re talking to Noah Kaufman, an emergency physician and CEO of Starbot, about the current state of Bitcoin. Noah, as we wrap up, what take-home messages would you like to leave with the KevinMD audience? Noah Kaufman: The most important thing for physicians to understand is that Bitcoin is like Pascal’s wager. Even if you don’t believe in it and think it’s a Ponzi scheme, it still makes sense to allocate 1 to 5 percent of your portfolio to it. Why? Because the risk is asymmetric. If Bitcoin fails, you lose a small amount—no big deal. But if it succeeds and reaches $2 million or $3 million per coin, it could dramatically improve your financial situation. Bitcoin has been de-risked significantly over the past few years. Institutions, nation-states, and pension funds are accumulating it. It’s becoming a mainstream asset. Physicians should consider owning some—not just for financial gain but to combat inflation and secure their financial futures. Kevin, thank you for having me on again. It’s always a pleasure to share my perspective with your audience. Kevin Pho: Noah, as always, thank you so much for sharing your insight and perspective. Thanks again for coming back on the show.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 12 Best Affordable Stocks To Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) stands against other best affordable stocks to buy. There has been a growing debate regarding whether the economy of the United States will have a soft landing. A recent report by Vanguard titled “Beyond Landing” released on November 25 discusses the economic outlook for the year ahead. The report highlighted that global inflation has significantly decreased over the past two years, nearing the target of 2%. However, this decline has been inconsistent across different regions, with many developed markets experiencing slowdowns due to monetary policy adjustments. The United States stands out as an exception, showcasing robust economic growth and full employment despite restrictive monetary policies. READ ALSO: 10 Best Small-Cap Stocks Ready To Explode and 10 Cheap NASDAQ Stocks To Invest In Now. The report raised critical questions about whether the US has achieved a "soft landing" or if high interest rates will eventually lead to a "hard landing." The narrative has largely focused on the Federal Reserve's ability to time rate cuts effectively to facilitate painless disinflation. Vanguard suggests that the strong growth and falling inflation in the US may be better explained by supply-side dynamics, such as increased labor productivity and a surge in available labor, rather than solely by Federal Reserve policies. Regarding the 2025 outlook, the firm anticipates that US real GDP growth may decline from around 3% to closer to 2%, influenced by potential policy risks like trade tariffs and stricter immigration regulations. Core inflation is expected to remain above 2.5% for most of 2025. The firm also predicts that interest rates will stabilize at levels higher than those seen during the 2010s, fostering better returns in cash and fixed-income markets over the next decade. However, they express caution regarding equity markets due to elevated valuations. The report highlights a tension between momentum and valuation in risk assets, suggesting that while some stocks may continue to perform well, their high valuations could pose risks if economic conditions change unexpectedly. A technician testing the latest 5G device, demonstrating the company's commitment to innovation. To compile the list of the 12 best affordable stocks to buy right now, we used the Finviz stock screener, Yahoo Finance, and Seeking Alpha. Using the screener we shortlisted stocks trading below a Forward P/E of 15, as of December 4, and that are expected to experience earnings growth this year. Next, we sorted our initial list by market capitalization and cross-checked the Forward P/E of each stock from Seeking Alpha and earnings growth from Yahoo Finance. Lastly, we ranked the stocks in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders as per Insider Monkey’s database for Q3 2024. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Forward P/E Ratio: 14.16 Earnings Growth This Year: 9.52% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74 QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a prominent technology company specializing in wireless communication technologies. It designs and manufactures integrated circuits and software for smartphones and smart devices, as well as advanced automotive technologies like automated driving systems. Its competitive edge originates from the numerous patents it holds in wireless technology. The company’s smartphone chipset, the Snapdragon series is one of the most widely used in the industry. Its Snapdragon X75 modem is not only being used to power the new iPhone 16 models but is also the powerhouse of the generative AI-enabled Galaxy series. During the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024 alone, QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) generated $33.2 billion in QCT revenue, up 9% year-over-year. Within the QCT segment handset revenue contributed $6.1 billion mainly due to the quick adoption of the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset. Looking ahead, Samsung's upcoming Galaxy S25 is expected to utilize the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, indicating continued growth for the company. Moreover, other manufacturers such as ASUS, Honor, OnePlus, and OPPO are also launching devices with this chipset. Management anticipates first-quarter fiscal 2025 revenue between $10.5 billion and $11.3 billion. Madison Sustainable Equity Fund stated the following regarding QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Alphabet Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM), Microsoft Corporation, and Apple Inc. were the largest detractors. Qualcomm has given back some of its first half gains after the CFO commented at a conference that its entrance into the AI PC business would take time to ramp. We continue to see Qualcomm as well positioned with growth from AI moving into the mobile phone, from new opportunities in the Internet of Things (IoT), and within the Auto industry but will also look to future growth as they enter the PC market.” Overall, QCOM ranks 8th on our list of best affordable stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential of QCOM to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Is Microsoft Corporation Inc. (MSFT) Dominating A Billionaire Quant’s Investment Strategy Right Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Stocks Dominating a Billionaire Quant's Investment Strategy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation Inc. (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other stocks that are dominating a billionaire quant's investment strategy. AQR Capital Management is a global investment management firm, founded by Cliff Asness in 1998, dedicated to delivering positive outcomes for its clients. AQR Capital Management has spent over two decades exploring market forces and applying insights to manage client portfolios effectively and has placed itself at the core of economics, behavioral finance, data, and technology. Cliff Asness, a renowned figure in finance, is the Founder, Managing Principal, and Chief Investment Officer at AQR Capital Management. He is recognized for his extensive research and contributions to financial literature with many awards to his name including multiple Bernstein Fabozzi/Jacobs Levy Awards, Graham and Dodd Awards, and the prestigious 2020 Fama/DFA Prize for Capital Markets and Asset Pricing. Asness' career began at Goldman, Sachs & Co., where he served as Managing Director and Director of Quantitative Research before founding AQR. He actively participates in professional organizations and serves on boards such as The Journal of Portfolio Management, Courant Institute of Mathematical Finance at NYU, Q-Group, and The National WWII Museum. Asness started with a $10 million investment from a small group of investors in 1995 and rapidly expanded the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund using quantitative strategies thereby increasing its assets to over $100 million within months. After Asness left Goldman Sachs in 1998 to establish his own hedge fund, the Alpha Fund continued to grow, reaching assets totaling $12 billion by 2007. Asness, a former doctoral student under Nobel laureate Eugene Fama, saw shifts in market efficiency over his career, through meme stocks and valuation disparities post-pandemic. He believes there's ongoing potential in value investing, as opposed to less than three years ago when opportunities were more noticeable. AQR, short for Applied Quantitative Research, operates as a hedge fund managing discretionary assets valued at $119.9 billion as of August 2023, according to their Form ADV filing. Their latest 13F filing for Q2 2023 disclosed a portfolio value $48.4 billion in 13F securities, with a top 10 holdings concentration of 14.42%. AQR manages around $8 billion of its total $99 billion assets under management in an emerging-market equities portfolio, employing a collaborative approach similar to its other funds. This strategy, which diversifies away from the dominance of US stocks, positions AQR alongside industry leaders like Morgan Stanley Investment Management. AQR's multi-strategy offerings achieved a 13.5% gain year-to-date through April 2024, following a 16% return in 2023. As global interest rates remain elevated, creating opportunities for hedge funds, AQR's futures-trading strategies have thrived amidst market volatility. AQR Capital Management is gradually integrating machine-driven strategies aiming to enhance performance and adapt to market dynamics. Despite initial skepticism towards machine learning in investing, AQR has expanded into trend-following strategies, including tracking fundamental signals and venturing into niche markets such as Malaysian palm oil and milk. Speaking at the Bloomberg Invest conference in New York, Asness emphasised that recent improvements in the firm's performance reflect not only market cycles but also strategic adjustments. "We let the machine decide more," Asness emphasized, noting his confidence in machine-based decision-making over human intuition. Our Methodology: Stocks mentioned in this article were picked from the investment portfolio of AQR Capital Management at the end of the third quarter of 2024. In order to provide readers with a more comprehensive overview of the companies, the analyst ratings for each firm are mentioned alongside other details. A database of around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2024 was used to quantify the popularity of each stock in the hedge fund universe. A development team working together to create the next version of Windows. Position size: $1.73 billion Activity: 5% Microsoft (MSFT) was the #1 position in AQR's portfolio at the end of the first quarter. Here is what we said six months ago: Analysts from Wolfe Research and Barclays believe that Microsoft Corporation Inc. (NASDAQ: MSFT) is well-positioned amid expected market volatility, emphasizing its resilience and investor appeal. MSFT has seen significant share price gains by 30% over the past one year. Following which multiple Wall Street analysts support bullish sentiments in addition to New Street Research that gave the Company a new Buy rating with a $570 price target. The company's strategic integration of AI in its Cloud division has driven impressive growth in its Intelligent Cloud segment. Microsoft's investments in its Search business, Bing, have also generated market share gains. Looking ahead, analysts anticipate continued earnings growth for MSFT, making its current valuation, with a forward P/E ratio of 31, attractive." At the time AQR had $1.67 billion invested in the stock and MSFT shares were trading at $421. MSFT stock only returned 5% since then and it isn't the top position in AQR's portfolio anymore. Overall, AQR owns only 0.05% of MSFT's outstanding shares. This may be a top 3 position for AQR but relatively AQR isn't too bullish on the stock. Overall MSFT ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks that are dominating a billionaire quant's investment strategy. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.
