Capital market regulator SEBI has given permission to Reliance Industries-owned Jio Financial Services and the American multi-national investment management company BlackRock to enter the mutual fund business in six months. The combination of Reliance Jio’s vast digital reach with BlackRock’s global investment expertise, the joint venture will democratise investment opportunities by attracting first-time retail investors. The competition in the MF industry has intensified with the entry of new players especially after SEBI eased the entry barriers to allow more players to enter asset management business and attract new investors from smaller cities. In last one year, the asset under MF industry increased 23 per cent to ₹70 lakh crore while the value of assets held by individual investors in MFs increased 21 per cent to ₹42 lakh crore. In fact, it will be a re-entry after 7 years for BlackRock into the Indian MF business after it sold 40 per cent stake in DSP MF. Tanmay Shah, MD, stock broking firm SIHL said the entry of Jio BlackRock into the asset management business marks a potentially disruptive shift, given the fact that MF penetration is still low. However, he said challenges remain in building investors trust, navigating regulatory requirements and competing with well-established AMCs. On the distribution side, AMFI last year granted execution-only platform license to Jio Payment Bank, a subsidiary of Jio Financial Services. EOP is a digital or online platform, which facilitates MF transactions such as subscription, redemption and switch transactions. Sunil Subramaniam, CEO of independent think-tank Sense and Simplicity said JioBlackRock will try to target becoming the largest player in the passives space by launching multiple factor-based passive funds which tweak an index to generate higher alpha and attract investment from large institutional investors like provident funds and family offices. By bringing in variation in the passive categories, the fund house may be able to charge a slightly higher fee. Using Jio’s marketing muscle it will try to protect its margins by going direct to customers, he said. With Jio Financial focusing on marketing and customer acquisition, and BlackRock bringing in its global expertise in passives, JioBlackRock MF will attempt to disrupt the market and achieve scale in the shortest possible time, he added. The fund will also open an office in GIFT City to channel inward and outbound foreign investments to take advantage of Blackrock’s Global expertise, said Subramaniam.

Title: Bitcoin Over Gold? BlackRock Says The Case Is Clear
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-over-gold-blackrock/
Time Published: 2025-05-28T23:00:47Z
Full Content:
Speaking from the Nakamoto Stage at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference, Robert Mitchnick, Head of Digital Assets at BlackRock, made a compelling case for BTC’s unique position in global finance—suggesting that the world’s largest asset manager sees Bitcoin not only as a legitimate portfolio hedge but also as a superior alternative to gold. Mitchnick described the performance of BlackRock’s iShares BTC Trust (IBIT) as “unprecedented,” but emphasized that this was still the early stage of adoption. “It’s very early in the life cycle of an ETF,” he said. “In many instances, it takes multiple years to truly get all the cylinders firing—from education to institutional diligence to onboarding across major wealth platforms.” While IBIT has already gained massive traction in US markets, BlackRock has recently launched a similar product in Europe and sees global expansion as essential. “We’re excited,” Mitchnick said. “This has really been a global story… even if you look at IBIT’s numbers, a massive amount of that actually comes from offshore wealth channels, including Asia.” A key theme of Mitchnick’s remarks was the growing institutional normalization of BTC. He cited BlackRock’s own model portfolios—widely used by wealth managers—as a turning point. “In February of this year, just about three months ago, one of those portfolios added Bitcoin as an allocation in the 1 to 2% range,” Mitchnick said. “That was not a sudden reaction to any one thing—that was the result of multiple years of analysis and research.” These allocations, he explained, allow financial advisers to include BTC without requiring direct client demand, accelerating passive adoption across advisory networks. Mitchnick pushed back hard against the long-standing claim that BTC merely behaves like a speculative tech stock. “Through most of Bitcoin’s history, it’s had very low correlation [to equities],” he noted. While he acknowledged periods of short-term alignment—particularly among leveraged retail traders—he argued that institutional investors see BTC differently: “They view Bitcoin as a differentiator in a portfolio and a potential hedge against some of the left-tail risks that exist elsewhere in traditional assets.” He illustrated the point with a sharp anecdote: “Think back to August 5th… the market had a mini meltdown and Bitcoin got clobbered that day. It had nothing to do with Bitcoin fundamentally… but Bitcoin doubled over the next four months.” According to Mitchnick, this shows how short-term volatility often leads to accumulation by long-term holders—those who view Bitcoin not as a “risk-on asset” but as a monetary hedge. Asked directly about the ongoing gold-versus-BTC debate, Mitchnick avoided the typical zero-sum framing. “They’re both global, scarce, decentralized, fixed-supply assets,” he said. “Gold has much less volatility and a longer history. But Bitcoin is digitally native, efficient to store, and can be transferred anywhere in near real time at near-zero cost.” Then he delivered the verdict: “Bitcoin has much higher upside than gold—and lower downside.” He also addressed why this narrative isn’t more dominant. “It’s amazing to me that the industry hasn’t promoted this more effectively,” he said, criticizing financial media and research firms that still link BTC’s value to irrelevant macro headlines. “Bitcoin’s never heard of tariffs. Doesn’t know what they are.” When asked about future crypto ETFs beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, Mitchnick drew a firm line. “Bitcoin is in a category of one,” he said. “The rest of crypto competes in different lanes, with different use cases… it looks more like tech equities or venture exposure.” As a result, he expects the correlation between BTC and other digital assets to fall further. On the topic of regulation, Mitchnick welcomed the growing bipartisan interest in Washington. “It’s just a great and encouraging thing that there is such momentum behind developing a regulatory framework,” he said. “Whether we’re talking about stablecoins or market structure, there’s great momentum there—and we’re excited to see how that shakes out.” At press time, BTC traded at $108,879.

XRP is back in the spotlight, now trading hands at just under $2.30. Investors remain bullish as excitement builds over a potential U.S.-listed spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) going live in the near future. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is now evaluating whether a proposed XRP ETF by WisdomTree offers adequate investor protection and safeguards against manipulation. The fund would be a major step toward broader institutional access and legitimacy for the Ripple-affiliated crypto if approved. According to a May 27 notice published by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, has started reviewing the WisdomTree XRP Trust. This marks the first formal review of a U.S.-based spot XRP ETF by the Commission. The SEC now has up to 240 days to approve or reject the ETF filing that would allow investors to gain exposure to XRP without having to hold or store the token themselves. The investment vehicle would track XRP’s market price via the CME CF Ripple-Dollar Reference Rate. If greenlighted, the WisdomTree XRP Trust would be the first American spot XRP market ETF — a watershed that could unlock the door for similar vehicles based on other altcoins. The Commission is now looking for public comments on whether the ETF’s design satisfactorily addresses concerns related to market manipulation and investor protection. Besides WisdomTree, a bevy of other investment managers, including Franklin Templeton, 21Shares, Bitwise, and Grayscale, have all applied with the SEC to introduce XRP ETFs in the U.S. This comes as a new Trump-Vance administration has rolled into Washington, which has taken a more lenient approach to crypto. The SEC itself has also turned a new regulatory leaf following former SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s departure in January, dropping most of the high-profile cases lodged during the Biden era. Bloomberg senior ETF analysts forecast an 85% chance of spot XRP ETF approval after the change in leadership at the SEC. The price of XRP is trading lower by 3.4% over the past 24 hours to $2.26. Approval of spot exchange-traded funds could unlock institutional capital, amplifying demand for XRP and potentially propelling prices toward $10. Some analysts even believe the XRP price could hit the elusive $100 threshold if prominent players like BlackRock and Fidelity jump into the ring.

Title: BlackRock reportedly plans to acquire a 10% stake in Circle’s upcoming IPO

The IPO would deepen the existing relationship between BlackRock and Circle, as it would constitute one of the largest single-investor stakes in the crypto company. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock plans to acquire approximately 10% of the shares offered in Circle’s initial public offering (IPO), Bloomberg News reported on May 28. People familiar with the matter said Circle and its shareholders, including co-founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire, are seeking to raise $624 million through the offering. Orders for the offering have reportedly exceeded the number of shares available, with the pricing scheduled for June 4. BlackRock already manages the Circle Reserve Fund, a government money market fund that holds roughly 90% of the reserves backing Circle’s USDC stablecoin. The fund reported nearly $30 billion in net assets as of April 30, 2024, based on the Circle IPO filing. The investment management firm could acquire its stake directly or through an affiliated entity, although its final participation remains subject to change. As a result, the IPO would deepen the existing relationship between BlackRock and Circle, as it would constitute one of the largest single-investor stakes in the crypto company. The filing also revealed a combined interest from major institutional investors, indicating heightened demand for equity in the stablecoin issuer as it prepares to enter the public markets. Circle’s USDC ranks as the second-largest US dollar-pegged stablecoin with a $61.3 billion market cap and plays a central role in crypto transfers. The stablecoin registered a $10 trillion year-to-date transfer volume as of April 30, according to data from Artemis. Pending legislation in Congress proposes backing stablecoins with cash or government securities, a structure already in place for USDC through the Circle Reserve Fund. Circle’s decision to proceed with a US-based IPO reflects broader efforts by crypto companies to secure public market capitalization at a time when federal regulatory policy is trending toward acceptance. Kraken is also reportedly eyeing an IPO for 2026. The IPO filing formalizes Circle’s long-anticipated listing plans, which previously included a terminated Special Purpose Acquisition Company deal in 2022. With backing from institutional players and a reserve fund managed by the world’s largest asset manager, Circle is positioning itself to expand operations under a more transparent and regulated capital structure.

Title: BlackRock Mulling 10% Stake in Circle’s IPO, Joining ARK as Potential Buyer: Bloomberg

BlackRock Inc. is considering acquiring roughly 10% of the shares offered in Circle’s upcoming initial public offering (IPO), Bloomberg reported Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter. The IPO filing, made public on Tuesday, lays out plans to offer 24 million Class A shares — 9.6 million from Circle and 14.4 million from existing stakeholders. According to the filing, Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management has expressed interest in buying up to $150 million worth of the IPO shares. The shares are expected to be priced between $24 and $26, and will be trading under the ticker 'CRCL'. BlackRock’s potential involvement, though significant, is still up in the air. Bloomberg reported that it remains unclear whether BlackRock would invest directly or via an affiliated vehicle, and that it could ultimately walk away from the deal. BlackRock didn't immediately respond to CoinDesk's request for comment. The asset management giant already maintains a close relationship with Circle. It manages the Circle Reserve Fund, a government money market fund that holds 90% of the reserves backing Circle’s USDC stablecoin. USDC is one of the largest dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies, used widely across crypto trading and DeFi protocols. If BlackRock follows through, the move would mark another major entry point for traditional finance into the digital asset space, further entrenching stablecoins like USDC in the broader financial system. The IPO would make Circle one of the few large crypto-native firms to go public in the U.S. after a long lull in public market debuts from the sector. Circle previously attempted to go public via a SPAC merger in 202, which was subsequently scrapped.

The native token of the Telegram-affiliated The Open Network, the 18th largest crypto by market value, was trading at $3.37, CoinGecko data shows. TON soared to almost $3.70 and was up about 23% at one point earlier in the morning. Telegram’s fortunes, which have risen in recent months, continued to swing upward on Wednesday. The company is preparing to raise $1.5 billion in a corporate-bond sale, The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday, citing several sources familiar with the company's plans. The messaging platform will issue five-year bonds offering a 9% yield—a raise that has invited interest from Emirati-owned investment firm Mubadala, BlackRock, and hedge-fund manager Citadel, according to The Journal. Telegram has shared with investors that it clocked $540 million in profits on $1.4 billion in revenue in 2024, people familiar with the matter told the publication—a major rebound from its lackluster performance the year prior. The app boasted one billion active users as of March 2025, according to Telegram's executives, and enrollment in its subscription services has roughly doubled over the past year or so. Separately, Telegram will deploy AI-powered chatbot Grok to its growing platform under the terms of a one-year agreement with Elon Musk's xAI, Telegram founder Pavel Durov said Wednesday in a social media post. Telegram will receive half of xAI's subscription sales made through the messaging platform, Durov tweeted. Later in the day, however, Musk pushed back on the announcement, replying on X hat "No deal has been signed." Durov replied, "True. Agreed in principle, but formalities are pending." The price of TON dipped following the exchange. Durov is still facing criminal charges in France related to alleged illegal activities hosted on Telegram, leaving the application's future somewhat uncertain. French authorities arrested Durov in August, alleging Telegram facilitated terrorism and drug trafficking enterprises, among other nefarious activities, on its platform. And earlier this month, authorities declined the founder's appeal to travel to the U.S. for "negotiations with investment funds,” POLITICO reported. Telegram created TON in 2018, but distanced itself from the network just two years later as it faced regulatory scrutiny over its role in the project. However, the messaging application began flirting with TON nearly two years later, hosting the TON Wallet App and tap-to-earn games in its application. The latter initiative helped TON garner widespread recognition last year, as viral tap-to-earn games such as Catizen and Hamster Kombat‌ amassed hundreds of millions of players on Telegram.

Title: TON jumps 16% as Telegram gets $300M plus xAI equity to integrate Grok

Telegram bags $300M in xAI deal as profits and bond bets reset trajectory. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Telegram is no longer just a privacy-first chat app for crypto bros. With a dramatic one-two punch, a $300 million alliance with Elon Musk’s xAI and a $1.5 billion high-yield bond raise, Telegram has moved from insurgent platform to profit engine. TON jumped 15% after Durov confirmed the collaboration. Yet its future, including IPO prospects, remains hostage to a legal tangle playing out in French courts. In a headline-grabbing move, Telegram announced an exclusive distribution agreement with xAI that will embed Grok, Musk’s LLM chatbot, into the platform for one year. The terms: xAI will pay $300 million in cash, as well as equity and 50% of all Grok-related subscription revenue generated through Telegram. “Together, we win ❤️📈🏆,” posted CEO Pavel Durov, celebrating what he framed as a platform-defining moment. The move marks Telegram’s first major monetisation of its 1 billion monthly active users (MAUs) – a sharp pivot from its historically donation- and debt-fuelled operations. Durov has insisted that Grok integration won’t compromise user data: “No Telegram data will be supplied for Grok training,” he wrote. The deal puts Telegram ahead of rivals like WhatsApp and Snapchat, who’ve struggled to extract revenue from AI features within messaging ecosystems. Telegram also disclosed its first-ever profit: $540 million in 2024, on revenue of $1.4 billion. This figure marks a dramatic turnaround from prior years, when the company operated at a steep loss. With 15 million paying users and organic growth of 2.5 million users per day, 2025 revenue is forecasted at $2 billion, with profit exceeding $700 million. For investors, the metrics finally validate Telegram’s long-gestating monetisation model. Along with announcing its AI deal, Telegram completed an oversubscribed $1.5 billion bond offering at a 9% yield, with major backers including BlackRock, Citadel, and Mubadala, according to WSJ. The five-year paper refinances debt from a 2021 convertible note and includes an IPO-linked conversion sweetener, an implicit bet that Telegram will go public before 2030. The bond’s success surprised some market watchers, especially given CEO Durov’s ongoing legal entanglements. But investors appear willing to price that risk as noise against Telegram’s unit economics and growth profile. Despite operational momentum, a significant cloud looms over Telegram’s prospects: founder Pavel Durov’s arrest in France in August 2024 and subsequent indictment on 12 preliminary charges, including non-cooperation with child safety investigations. Durov remains under judicial supervision and is barred from leaving France. A May 12 court ruling blocked his planned trip to the U.S. to meet investors. “We complied with all the binding legal requests we received,” Durov told the WSJ. “Up until this day, we don’t understand what we did wrong.” The legal case could delay or derail IPO ambitions, raise governance concerns, and complicate global platform operations. It also emphasizes broader regulatory questions about the liabilities of end-to-end encrypted app providers. Is Telegram now on a glide path to IPO? Possibly, but not inevitably. The bond’s conversion feature suggests that at least the option remains alive. But some analysts argue the high-yield raise could be a bridge or even a hedge, a way to lock in growth without public-market scrutiny while Durov navigates his legal peril. The one-year Grok integration, too, carries open questions: Will AI subs stick? Can xAI deliver? Will regulators scrutinise the data layer despite Durov’s assurances? And if Musk stumbles, what becomes of the promised $300 million? Still, with its platform pivot, Telegram has shed the image of a burning-money outlier. Whether it becomes a public tech titan or a cautionary tale may depend as much on courtroom outcomes as on product-market fit. Telegram’s summer surge, marked by AI monetisation and a bold debt raise, signals a company evolving into a sustainable business. But Durov’s legal cloud may prove the ultimate variable in whether Telegram becomes the next great tech IPO or a cautionary tale of platform governance in the age of encryption.

Title: Blockchain oracle RedStone brings tokenized TradFi assets to Solana in partnership with Securitize
URL: https://cryptobriefing.com/redstone-tokenized-tradfi-assets-solana/
Time Published: 2025-05-28T14:00:03Z
Full Content:
Share this article RedStone is launching its blockchain oracle services on Solana in partnership with Securitize, enabling access to tokenized traditional financial assets like US Treasuries and credit products, the company announced on Wednesday. The integration, powered by Wormhole Queries, is aimed at providing Solana builders with price feeds for both traditional and crypto assets. Developers can now incorporate real-world assets (RWAs), such as Apollo’s $ACRED or BlackRock’s $BUIDL, into dApps. Discussing the launch, RedStone co-founder Marcin Kazmierczak said the development represents a foundational shift in how tokenized RWAs are utilized on Solana. Rather than serving solely as static, tokenized instruments, RWAs can now be actively composed within DeFi protocols, enabling practical use cases that bridge traditional financial products with on-chain systems. “This is a foundational step in making RWAs not just visible but usable in DeFi on Solana,” said Kazmierczak in a statement. “It’s no longer just about tokenization — it’s about composability and unlocking use cases that merge traditional and onchain finance.” Securitize, which partners with major asset managers including Apollo, BlackRock, and VanEck, has chosen RedStone as the oracle provider for its tokenized products. The company said it has accumulated over $3.6 billion in tokenized assets under management. “We’re seeing the walls come down between TradFi and DeFi,” said Securitize’s Head of Credit and DeFi, Reid Simon. “The next evolution is about giving global institutions the tools to transact seamlessly across chains.” RedStone’s collaboration with Securitize, announced in March, helps enhance the usability of Securitize’s tokenized funds across DeFi platforms. RedStone delivers price feeds for these assets, enabling their integration into money market exchanges and collateralized DeFi platforms, with cross-chain capabilities on networks such as Ethereum, Avalanche, and Polygon. Earlier this month, RedStone’s $ACRED feed was successfully deployed in a Morpho vault on Polygon, one of the first live DeFi vaults to integrate a major RWA. The Solana expansion could enable similar products to reach a wider audience, from retail to institutional users. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Instant messaging app Telegram has signed a deal with Elon Musk's xAI to integrate the Grok AI service within the app. Telegram founder Pavel Durov, revealed on X, that the two companies agreed to a 1-year partnership that would see Telegram receive $300 million in cash and equity from xAI, in addition to 50% of revenue from xAI subscriptions sold via Telegram. "Together, we win!" Durov wrote. The deal comes as Telegram looks to raise $1.5 billion via a bond offering that is being backed by the likes of BlackRock, Mubadala, and Citadel. The proceeds of the raise will be used to repurchase debt from Telegram’s earlier bond issuance in 2021.

Messaging platform Telegram is raising at least $1.5 billion through a new bond offering. The firm is raising the funds through a five-year bond with a 9% yield, which has drawn interest from both returning investors such as the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock and Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund Mubadala, as well as new entrants including hedge fund Citadel, the Wall Street Journal reports citing sources with the deal. The proceeds will be used to repurchase debt from Telegram’s earlier bond issuance in 2021, due next March. The new bonds are convertible into equity at a discount if Telegram goes public. Telegram originally developed layer 1 network TON, before making it an independent operation. In April, tokenization firm Libre said it plans to tokenize $500 million worth of Telegram debt on TON as Telegram Bond Fund (TBF).

Title: Telegram to raise $1.5B in bond sale, Citadel joins BlackRock in backing the deal: WSJ

Time Published: 2025-05-28T10:15:01Z

Share this article Telegram, the popular messaging platform, is preparing to issue at least $1.5 billion in new bonds on Wednesday, having secured commitments from both new investors, including Citadel, and established bondholders such as BlackRock and Mubadala, The Wall Street Journal reported early Wednesday. The bond will have a 5-year term at a 9% yield, according to the report. Proceeds from the bond offering will be used to buy back Telegram’s 2021 bonds, which mature in March 2026. About $400 million of that earlier debt has already been repurchased. Investors will have the option to convert their debt into shares at a discount if Telegram pursues a public offering, though an IPO appears unlikely in the near term. The deal signals that investors remain confident in Telegram’s financial trajectory and user growth, despite legal uncertainty around its founder, Pavel Durov. Durov has faced preliminary charges in France for allegedly refusing to cooperate with investigations into illegal activity on the platform. After being detained and investigated in France last year, in March, Durov was granted permission by an investigating judge to temporarily leave France. In a statement post-return to Dubai, United Arab Emirates, where Telegram’s headquarters and operations are located, he stated that Telegram has not only met but also exceeded legal expectations in moderation, cooperation, and crime prevention. Ahead of the bond offering, Telegram reported a $540 million profit in 2024, according to the Financial Times, which cited a company presentation shared with potential investors. The profit marked a sharp turnaround from a $173 million loss the previous year, with revenue soaring to $1.4 billion, driven largely by premium subscriptions, advertising, and partnerships tied to the Ton blockchain ecosystem. The announcement sparked a rally in Toncoin (TON), the crypto asset tied to The Open Network, which climbed 6% to nearly $3.2 shortly after the news, according to CoinGecko data. TON has previously shown a quick reaction to developments involving Telegram and its CEO. Last August, the token plunged 18% following Durov’s arrest, only to rebound after his release. Also on Wednesday, the TON Foundation announced it had appointed former Visa executive Nikola Plecas as vice president of payments to lead its global payments strategy. Plecas will focus on enhancing payment capabilities within The Open Network (TON) and managing partnerships, particularly involving TON and Telegram, while also overseeing compliance.

Title: 2 trades BlackRock bond chief Rick Rieder told us he's making to help generate almost 7% yield
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/highest-yields-fixed-income-bond-market-trades-investing-blackrock-rieder-2025-5
Time Published: 2025-05-28T08:00:02Z
Full Content:
It's been a particularly busy start to the year for BlackRock's bond chief, Rick Rieder — not that someone overseeing $3 trillion in assets has all that much spare time to begin with. The economic policy uncertainty that President Donald Trump has introduced has sent the bond market flailing in a way Rieder hasn't seen before. But the volatility isn't necessarily a bad thing. "There is change afoot. One of the great things about investing in this environment is it's not static," Rieder told Business Insider. "The reaction function to any piece of news can be really extreme," he added. "So markets go through these periods of illiquidity, and it just presents these great opportunities that, by the way, may only be there for 10 minutes, or an hour, or a day. But I've never seen markets move to such extremes." Rieder shared a few of those opportunities he's leaning into at the moment in his iShares Flexible Income Active ETF (BINC), which yields 6.6% and has grown to $9 billion in assets since launching in May 2023. One of them is the front end of the yield curve, or short-duration Treasurys. Yields on the two-year note had dropped from 4.3% last year to 3.6% in April as investors started to price in as many as five rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. But as rate-cut expectations have fallen, yields have risen back up to nearly 4%, making them more attractive. Front-end bonds also offer a hedge for economic volatility in the short term, allowing investors to clip a robust coupon without being locked in for too long. The long end of the curve, meanwhile, isn't acting as a recession hedge, Rieder said, with investors worried about inflation from tariffs and rising yields thanks to ballooning fiscal spending deficits. "I'd rather keep yield up and not have to worry about the volatility," Rieder said. "The long end is not a hedge," he added. "Its traditional offsetting risk function doesn't work today, and so until yields move significantly higher, I don't see any significant reason to own longer in interest rates." Long-end rates in Europe, however, are more attractive, Rieder said. He said he's betting on European B- and BB-rated high-yield bonds to deliver higher yields. This is because economic growth is slowing to a greater degree in Europe than in the US, and inflation is tamer, so the European Central Bank is likely to cut rates more aggressively. This has meant limited upside volatility for European rates. For example, while 10-year Treasury yields have surged from 3.99% to 4.43% since April 4, 10-year eurozone bond yields have been virtually flat, falling by just 3 basis points from 3.13% to 3.1%. When yields rise, bonds lose their value, and vice versa. "Taking some of your interest-rate risk in Europe versus the US — particularly versus long US — has been an exciting thing to be involved with," Rieder said. "Usually, US and European rates move together," he added. "Now you're seeing historic movements of European rates relative to the US, meaning European rates are much more stable." Plus, the dollar's weakness relative to the euro is icing on the cake. "Because of the cross-currency swap, you could buy Europe and you get a couple of percent of additional yield," Rieder said. To mitigate the downside risk of some of the higher-yield bonds in his portfolio, Rieder pairs them with high-quality assets like AAA collateralized loan obligations, he said.

Title: Tether’s 2-Year, $5 Billion Investment Blitz Fuels US Companies: CEO

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Tether, the issuer of the USDT stablecoin, has quietly funneled roughly $5 billion of its earnings into a mix of US businesses and government debt over the past two years. It’s putting money where its mouth is. According to CEO Paolo Ardoino, these moves are meant to show how tied the company is to the American economy, even as it dominates markets abroad. According to Ardoino, Tether invested $775 million in Rumble earlier this year, scooping up more than 103 million shares of Class A stock. The firm also put $200 million into BlackRock Neurotech in 2024 through Tether Evo, its venture arm. That move made Tether the majority owner of the brain‐interface startup. These aren’t small stakes. They’re big plays on what could be the next wave of tech growth in the US. In the last 2 years Tether Group reinvested almost 5 billion USD of its profits within the United States economy and into US based companies. Some examples: Rumble, Blackrock Neurotech, XXI and different Bitcoin mining ventures. (That’s on top of having more than 120 billion in… — Paolo Ardoino 🤖 (@paoloardoino) May 26, 2025 Based on reports, Tether has also built positions in several US‐based Bitcoin mining firms. It recently boosted its holding in Bitdeer to 21%, making it one of the top shareholders. On top of that, the company is routing hash power to the OCEAN pool, tying its crypto reserves even more directly to American mining operations. It’s a mix of finance and hardware. According to filings, Tether holds more than $120 billion in US Treasury bills. That makes it the 19th‐largest holder of US debt, ahead of countries like Germany ($111 billion) and the United Arab Emirates ($104 billion). These Treasury bills back most of the USDT in circulation. In a way, Tether has become a major player in the bond market, with a clear interest in keeping US fiscal matters steady. Based on statements from Ardoino, Tether plans to launch a new dollar‐backed coin for the US market once federal rules are in place. While USDT will stay active in developing nations, a fresh token could meet upcoming US stablecoin laws. With $153 billion in USDT out there—about 60% of the total stablecoin supply—Tether still leads globally. But in the US and Europe, USDT has seen some exchange delistings over MiCA compliance worries. A homegrown coin may smooth those relations. Tether’s strategy isn’t without challenges. It faces calls for more transparency on its reserves and criticism over the use of USDT by bad actors. The company insists it works closely with law enforcement when criminal funds surface. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView They say journalists never truly clock out. But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. They say journalists never truly clock out. But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: Wall Street rallies on Trump’s EU tariff delay

Wall Street’s roller-coaster ride created by President Donald Trump’s trade policies whipped back upward on Tuesday, this time because of a delay for his tariffs on the European Union. The S&P 500 leaped 2% in its first trading since Trump said Sunday that the United States will delay a 50% tariff on goods coming from the European Union until July 9 from June 1. The European Union’s chief trade negotiator later said on Monday that he had “good calls” with Trump officials and the EU was “fully committed” to reaching a trade deal by July 9. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 740 points, or 1.8%, and the Nasdaq composite rallied 2.5%. They more than recovered their losses from Friday, when Wall Street’s roller coaster dropped after Trump announced the tariffs on France, Germany and the other 25 countries represented by the European Union. Such talks give hopes that the United States can reach a deal with one of its largest trading partners that would keep global commerce moving and avoid a possible recession. Trump declared a similar pause on his stiff tariffs for products coming from China earlier this month, which launched an even bigger rally on Wall Street at the time. “We focus on actions over words,” Jean Boivin and other strategists at BlackRock Investment Institute said, “as economic constraints spur policy rollbacks.” Caution still remains on Wall Street, of course, even if the S&P 500 has climbed back within 3.6% of its record after falling roughly 20% below the mark last month. A worry is that all the uncertainty caused by on-again-off-again tariffs could damage the economy by pushing U.S. households and businesses to freeze their spending and investments. Surveys have already shown U.S. consumers are feeling worse about the economy’s prospects and where inflation may be heading because of tariffs. On Tuesday, though, optimism ruled. The stock market’s gains accelerated after a report released by the Conference Board said confidence among U.S. consumers improved by more in May than economists expected. It was the first increase in six months, and consumers’ expectations for income, business and the job market in the short term jumped sharply, though it still remains below the level that typically signals a recession ahead. About half the survey results came after Trump paused some of his tariffs on China. The rise in confidence was widespread, covering different age and income groups, according to the Conference Board. On Wall Street, Nvidia rallied 3.2% and was the strongest single force driving the S&P 500 higher ahead of its profit report coming on Wednesday. It’s the last to report this quarter among the “Magnificent Seven” Big Tech companies that have grown so large that their stock movements dominate the rest of the market. Nvidia has been riding a tidal wave of growth created by the frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology, but it is also facing criticism that its stock price has shot too high. Informatica climbed 6% after Salesforce said it would buy the AI-powered cloud data management company in an all-stock deal valuing it at about $8 billion. Salesforce rose 1.5%. They were part of widespread gains across the U.S. stock market, where 93% of the stocks within the S&P 500 rose. One of the outliers was AutoZone, which fell 3.7% following a mixed report on its performance for the three months through May 10. Its profit fell short of analysts’ expectations, though its growth in revenue was stronger than expected. CEO Phil Daniele said both its DIY and commercial businesses did well domestically, but shifting moves in foreign-currency values put pressure on the retailer’s operations outside the United States. All told, the S&P 500 rose 118.72 points to 5,921.54. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 740.58 to 42,343.65, and the Nasdaq composite gained 461.96 to 19,199.16. In the bond market, Treasury yields eased to take some of the pressure off the stock market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.44% from 4.51% late Friday. It had been rising last week, in part because of worries about the U.S. government’s rapidly increasing debt. Yields had been climbing for bond markets around the developed world, particularly in Japan, where a recent auction of longer-term bonds found relatively few buyers. But analysts said worries eased a bit after Japan’s finance ministry sent a questionnaire to bond investors that they took as a signal of efforts to calm the market. In stock markets abroad, European indexes mostly rose, while Asian indexes were mixed. ___ AP Business Writers Matt Ott and Elaine Kurtenbach contributed.

The $65 billion Dutch pension fund PME is reportedly warning US money managers not to abandon their “basic principles of stewardship” during the Trump era. According to a new Bloomberg report, PME says US money managers are allegedly risking significant business by “caving into pressures” from President Donald Trump’s administration by abandoning basic principles of responsible investing. Says Daan Spaargaren, PME’s senior strategist for responsible investing, “[US money managers] aren’t condemning what Trump is doing and how he is operating and how he is handling issues like climate change and demolishing the judiciary. We are worried about that.” The PME warns America’s investment industry that a Trump capitulation is prompting it to think twice about its US investments. The PME is reconsidering its $5.7 billion mandate with BlackRock Inc., after the world’s largest asset manager withdrew from the Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) initiative. A decision from PME is expected within weeks. Spaargaren says Trump’s actions that are raising concerns include attacking judges, countering America’s move to cleaner energies and the removal of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies. “[If asset managers] align their interests and their policies with the current administration in the US, then we are legitimizing also these steps and these practices by offering them our funds.” Follow us on X, Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Title: 2 reasons BlackRock sees upside ahead for one beaten-down corner of the stock market

US clean energy might seem an early victim of policy shifts and funding cuts, but BlackRock says its still a key source of power and an area of the stock market that could rise. Even with renewable power facing heightened scrutiny from the Trump administration, coupled with the erosion of tax benefits in the congressional reconciliation bill, two things should keep investors interested in the space. First, energy demand isn't ebbing, and clean energy will be needed more than ever. "The US likely needs more of all kinds of energy to meet AI's needs," BlackRock wrote in a note on Tuesday. "Industry projections see US data center electricity consumption rising between 50% and 200% by 2030 — a big jump after 15 years of flat national power demand." In other words, Washington can't afford to slash a leading source of electricity if the US is to maintain its artificial intelligence leadership. According to the Energy Information Administration, solar is projected to lead US power generation growth through 2026. Together with wind, solar overtook coal in the nation's energy mix for the first time in 2024. Second, BlackRock says industry headwinds are priced into renewable power stocks. "Longer term, we see clean energy stocks positioned for strong growth," BlackRock wrote. "Renewables are quick to build and valuations are attractive: the factors that contributed to their slump — like high rates and tariffs — are now priced in, we think." BlackRock also suggested that investors keep tabs on nuclear stocks, with the Trump administration's focus on nuclear making the sector poised for growth. "Last week, President Trump signed executive orders aimed at expediting nuclear power reactor deployment, and the most recent revisions to the House bill preserved the existing tax credits allotted to nuclear project developers," BlackRock wrote. "But given how long it takes to build nuclear power plants, we see natural gas and renewables benefiting sooner." Where Big Tech secrets go public — unfiltered in your inbox weekly.

Title: Enduring value: Traditional assets with modern strategy

Time Published: 2025-05-27T16:24:20Z

Dominic Kohler, head of investment and client solutions at Brown Shipley, a Quintet Private Bank, reflects on the resilience of traditional assets, equities and bonds, amid inflation, volatility, and a new generation of investor expectations. Marked by rapid macroeconomic shifts, traditional asset classes such as equities and fixed income are being tested like never before. According to Kohler, the investment landscape is one of complexity and opportunity where prudence, adaptability, and trust are more valuable than ever. The gold standard of business intelligence. Find out more “We have been navigating a challenging environment over the past couple of years,” Kohler notes. “High interest rates, sustained inflationary pressure, volatile markets and continued geopolitical uncertainty” have reshaped how traditional assets are perceived and deployed. For equities, Kohler stresses, “being more selective; quality and resilience matter more than ever.” On the fixed income side, the outlook has brightened. “Things are looking up again now that yields are more attractive.” This combination of cautious optimism and tactical flexibility underscores Brown Shipley’s broader approach. “It’s a market where careful positioning is key – with a focus on the long term whilst also looking for opportunities as and when they present themselves.” Even as inflation shows signs of cooling, Kohler maintains that preserving wealth remains a core priority especially for private clients seeking long-term stability. Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. “Apart from capital appreciation, our investment philosophy also includes a focus on wealth protection,” he explains. “Even with inflation starting to ease, this remains key. Quality shares and government or corporate bonds remain reliable tools to help us deliver on our philosophy.” While new asset classes and financial innovations continue to emerge, Kohler believes in the continued importance of traditional investments. “We are convinced that – even with changing market conditions, new asset classes and product innovation – traditional assets will continue to play a key role.” Brown Shipley employs a flexible yet disciplined approach to asset allocation, allowing it to respond quickly to market developments without losing sight of long-term objectives. “We have a dynamic asset allocation approach,” Kohler explains. “We actively adjust our positioning as the market changes, always guided by our long-term outlook but responsive to short-term shifts.” During periods of heightened volatility, this might involve reducing exposure to riskier assets like equities and increasing allocations to higher-quality bonds. “Within equities, we lean towards sectors and companies that are better positioned to weather uncertainty,” he adds. “On fixed income, with yields now more attractive, bonds have become an effective tool not only for capital preservation but also income generation.” While traditional assets form the core of most portfolios, Kohler highlights the growing relevance of alternatives in achieving true diversification. “It’s all about finding the right mix,” he says. “Alternatives can help reduce risk, increase diversification and provide an illiquidity premium.” Private markets, in particular, are gaining traction especially with younger, more growth-oriented investors. However, Kohler offers a word of caution. “Private markets are complex and often poorly understood. Clear communication and positioning of the benefits – and risks – is therefore important.” Despite the rise of alternatives and digital investments, Kohler remains confident in the long-term performance potential of traditional assets. “We are focused on providing consistent risk-adjusted returns over the long term,” he says. “Traditional assets still have a strong role to play. They can offer stability and consistency, particularly when clients see uncertainty and risk in the market.” Moreover, risk management is central to Brown Shipley’s investment philosophy. Through its parent company, Quintet, the bank partners with BlackRock to gain access to cutting-edge risk assessment tools. “As part of our partnership with BlackRock, we utilise best-in-class risk management tools to stress-test portfolios and consider various market scenarios,” Kohler explains. But numbers alone aren’t enough. “It is critical that advisers are close to clients and understand what is most important to them – spending time with them and ensuring their strategy remains aligned to their investment objectives and personal circumstances.” Where geopolitical developments can move markets overnight, Kohler’s advice is to remain level-headed. “Whether elections, conflicts or tariff announcements, we look at how such events may affect markets and adjust portfolios as required,” he says. “However, as we have seen at the start of this year, it is key to filter out the noise – whilst it is important to seek out opportunities, sometimes standing firm in our positioning can be the best course of action in the long run.” Looking ahead, Kohler sees several forces reshaping the future of traditional investing from regulatory shifts and product innovation to the expectations of younger investors. “We are in the midst of the largest wealth transfer in history,” he says. “Younger investors have an increased focus on thematic and sustainable investing. We are continuing to evolve our product offering accordingly, providing clients more choices about how their wealth is managed and invested.” Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) considerations are increasingly front and centre. But Brown Shipley’s approach is personalised rather than prescriptive. “ESG is often about deeply held beliefs, reflecting the individual values of the families we serve,” Kohler explains. “That’s why we do not impose our values but rather offer our clients a wide range of choices so they can invest in alignment with their values.” Incorporating ESG, he notes, is also a matter of sound investing. “Investors are constantly seeking to limit their investment universe by excluding poorly run or excessively risky companies. Incorporating ESG metrics is an attempt to evaluate and avoid risk – and identify opportunities – based on factors not always associated with investment decisions in the past.” While the human relationship remains at the core of client service, technology is playing an increasingly important role in portfolio construction and management. “Technology helps us make more informed decisions faster,” Kohler says. “We have a number of key partnerships that have given us access to market-leading technology that our clients benefit from as they feed into our internal processes and decision-making.” Still, he adds, “human interaction and judgement remain essential.” Traditional assets continue to offer a solid foundation for wealth preservation and growth. For Brown Shipley, it’s not just about selecting the right stocks or bonds, it’s about building long-term trust, leveraging innovation responsibly, and staying anchored to what matters most to clients. As Kohler puts it: “With the right allocation and solid instrument selection, traditional assets can continue to deliver superior long-term returns.”

Title: BTC reclaims $110k as Trump Media announces $2.5B Bitcoin treasury

Trump Media and Technology Group, a Donald Trump-linked company that’s publicly traded in the US, has announced it’s raising $2.5 billion to invest in Bitcoin (BTC). Bitcoin price, which had hovered around $109k before the news, jumped to above $110,000 as bulls looked to reclaim the upper hand. The news comes as Bitcoin 2025, a major Bitcoin conference, begins in Las Vegas, with Trump sons Eric and Trump Jr expected as speakers. Nasdaq and NYSE Texas-listed Trump Media, trading under the ticker DJT, is the operator of Trump’s social media app Truth Social as well as streaming platform Truth+ and financial technology firm Truth.Fi. On Tuesday, the company revealed plans to raise $2.5 billion from 50 institutional investors, with subscription agreements targeting $1.5 billion of Trump Media common stock and $1 billion in convertible senior secured notes. The funds raised from this private placement offering will close on May 29, 2025. According to the announcement, the proceeds of the offering will be used to adopt a Bitcoin treasury. “We view Bitcoin as an apex instrument of financial freedom, and now Trump Media will hold cryptocurrency as a crucial part of our assets. Our first acquisition of a crown jewel asset, this investment will help defend our Company against harassment and discrimination by financial institutions,” said Devin Nunes, chief executive officer and chairman of Trump Media. Adding Bitcoin to the Trump family-owned company’s balance sheet will see it join other publicly-traded companies that now hodl billions of dollars worth of the digital asset. The biggest player in this corporate frenzy for BTC is Strategy, which has amassed over $40 billion in BTC since first buying it in 2020. The surge in spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has also seen BlackRock gobble up thousands of BTC as inflows mount. Crypto.com and Anchorage Digital are Trump Media’s custody providers as it embarks on this BTC treasury venture. Other companies to help TMTG are Yorkville Securities and Clear Street as co-lead placement agents, and Cantor Fitzgerald as financial advisor. Bitcoin price changed hands around $110,065 at the time of writing, just 1.7% off its all-time high of $111,970 reached on May 22, 2025.

Title: Google slashes quantum requirement to crack Bitcoin by 95% with technology a decade away

Expert predictions point to a possible Bitcoin split due to rising quantum computing capabilities. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Bitcoin’s cryptographic resilience is facing renewed questions after a Google researcher suggested that quantum computers may be capable of breaking its encryption far sooner than expected. Craig Gidney, a leading quantum computing researcher at Google, published new findings indicating that the hardware requirements to break 2048-bit RSA encryption, a key mathematical element similar to that of Bitcoin, have dropped significantly. Gidney pointed out that his earlier estimates placed the threshold at 20 million noisy qubits, but the new projection requires fewer than one million. The reduced computational burden marks a significant leap in quantum capability, though it might take several days instead of a few hours. The Google researcher attributes the advancement to more refined quantum algorithms and enhanced error correction techniques that reduce the number of physical qubits needed by encoding logical qubits more efficiently. The revelations arrive as concerns grow over the pace of quantum computing development. Last year, Google introduced its Willow chip, a next-generation quantum processor that many believe brought real-world threats to digital security closer than previously assumed. In response, major financial institutions are updating their disclosures. For example, BlackRock recently flagged quantum computing as a material risk for its Bitcoin ETF product, IBIT. According to the firm: “If quantum computing technology is able to advance and significantly increase its capacity relative to the capacity of today’s leading quantum computers, it could potentially undermine the viability of many of the cryptographic algorithms used across the world’s information technology infrastructure, including the cryptographic algorithms used for digital assets like Bitcoin.” This shift reflects growing awareness that technological breakthroughs could challenge Bitcoin’s foundational encryption earlier than anticipated. Despite the concern, some experts believe the crypto sector still has time to adapt to the potential risks. Today’s logical-qubit demos top out at dozens (e.g., Quantinuum’s 12 logical qubits). Gidney’s 1,000,000-qubit figure is about physical (noisy) qubits, not logical. We’re three orders of magnitude away in sheer qubit count, and need major error-rate breakthroughs. Even the physical-qubit goal is likely 8–12 years out, and a true million-logical-qubit machine is decades away. Meanwhile, Bitcoin analyst Fred Krueger believes the emergence of a “quantum-resistant” version of the top crypto is inevitable. He anticipates a network split between a newly fortified Bitcoin and a legacy version, similar to how Ethereum split into ETH and Ethereum Classic. He stated: “Ulimately there will be a fork. ‘Quantum Resistant Bitcoin (QRB)’ and ‘Bitcoin Classic.’ The big money will recognize and push QRB. Some will fight it. Bitcoin Classic (BTC) will become the new Ethereum Classic.” Still, if Bitcoin becomes vulnerable in eight years, the network will not have long to adopt a quantum-resistant upgrade. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential. He imparts insights on a range of topics like DeFi, hacks, mining and culture, underlining transformative power.

Title: Prometheum Eyes U.S. Tokenization Boom With Acquisition and Fully Regulated Stack
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/05/27/prometheum-eyes-us-tokenization-boom-with-acquisition-and-fully-regulated-stack
Time Published: 2025-05-27T12:26:44Z
Full Content:
Prometheum, the controversial digital asset securities firm, is aiming to achieve a jumpstart in the lucrative tokenization boom, acquiring a broker-dealer and launching a digital transfer agent registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the company told CoinDesk exclusively. ProFinancial, the firm’s newly acquired FINRA-member and SEC-registered broker-dealer, can offer primary sales of various securities products, giving issuers a pathway to raise capital directly in tokenized form. Prometheum Coinery, meanwhile, handles shareholder records and corporate actions both on and off the blockchain. The additions build on existing services for custody, clearing, and secondary trading via its affiliated broker-dealers, Prometheum Capital and Prometheum ATS. With the latest move, the company aims to position as one of the few U.S.-regulated players offering a vertically integrated route for bringing real-world assets into a blockchain-native format—a capability likely to become more critical as the tokenization trend matures. "Securities, commodities, everything else is moving on-chain, and there needs to be an infrastructure for that. [There's] a pie that's going to grow significantly, just like everything went from paper to electronic," Aaron Kaplan, co-CEO told CoinDesk in an interview. "We are in a prime position, in my opinion, to be a significant player in that growing ecosystem." The expansion comes as asset tokenization emerges as one of the fastest-growing corners of crypto tech at a time when U.S. regulators signal a friendlier approach towards digital assets. Tokenization stands for using blockchain rails for moving and managing traditional instruments like bonds, funds and other securities, with global asset managers and banks increasingly getting involved to achieve operational efficiencies and cheaper, faster settlements. It's potentially a lucrative opportunity: the tokenized asset market could balloon to multiple trillion dollars over the next few years, a range of reports from BCG, Ripple, McKinsey, 21Shares projected. It's no surprise then that tokenization firms are jockeying for position to seize the opportunity as the sector heats up. Recently, digital asset manager Superstate registered its transfer agent with the SEC and unveiled a tokenized equity trading platform. Securitize, a tokenization firm backed by BlackRock and Jump Crypto, purchased MG Stover's fund administration business, while financial services provider Apex Group last week announced the acquisition of tokenization specialist Tokeny. Prometheum, founded in 2017, made headlines over the past years with efforts to comply with the Gary Gensler-led SEC, known for its harsh stance towards crypto. The company also divided the digital asset industry with wanting to provide securities-focused services for cryptocurrencies like ether ETH$2,636.83. With the new entities, the firm is now able to offer a fully-integrated platform for tokenized securities, from initial issuance to secondary market trading and custody, all within U.S. securities laws, something that's difficult to achieve, Kaplan argued. "It's a much bigger lift than what was done previously with these other [tokenization] firms," Kaplan said. Creating a digital token of an asset is the "low-hanging fruit," while being able to handle trading and post-trading are "exponentially harder," he explained. "The harder parts are what we built first," he said. "Other [firms] went the other route, which was the lowest hanging fruit first, and they've had a harder time transitioning the other way." "So with this announcement, it's pretty clear that the low-hanging fruit is in our purview," he said. Jesse Hamilton contributed reporting.

ByMax (Chong) Li ByMax (Chong) Li, Contributor. ABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - MAY 15: U.S. President Donald J. Trump signs the guestbook as UAE ... More President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan looks on and gives a thumbs up gesture after a meeting at Qasr al Watan (Palace of the Nation) on May 15, 2025, in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Trump is on the third day of his visit to the Gulf to underscore the strategic partnership between the United States and regional allies including the UAE, focusing on security and economic collaboration. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images) I’ve spent a decent amount of springtime in Abu Dhabi this year, seeing the UAE orchestrate a remarkable transformation from a traditional oil giant to a competent leader in the global digital economy. The push? AI and crypto, leveraging the nation's favorable policies and strategic geographic location while the two biggest economies in this world are at odds. Despite their individual strengths, AI and blockchain are increasingly interlaced, both striving towards systems that offer better autonomy, transparency, and data-driven intelligence, reshaping industries through their combined innovative potential. This drive will largely help the UAE capitalize on their complementary advantages to rewrite the global economic and technological race during this time of uncertainty. To know how the UAE is playing their range, we must look differently through the lens of Dubai and Abu Dhabi, the two iconic sites that share responsibility for the nation’s strategic ascent to leadership in Web3 and AI. Dubai's strategy is characterized by its emphasis on agility, a strong commercial focus, and a clear ambition to be a global hub for FinTech, AI, and Web3. It leverages its established reputation as a business-friendly environment with world-class infrastructure, together with its latest push to build supportive regulatory frameworks to attract innovation, talent, and capital. Abu Dhabi's strategy is more geared towards a top-down, institutional approach, emphasizing foundational research, advanced technology development, and the establishment of strategic, large-scale infrastructure projects. It aims to become a global leader in AI and institutional-grade digital assets through significant government investment and fostering deep partnerships. To conclude, this dual approach allows the UAE to capitalize on a broad spectrum of opportunities in the global digital economy. As for the long-term results, questions that remain to be asked include:
