Title: Solana’s first staking ETF outpaces XRP and ETH futures in opening day performance

SSK's debut day outshines contenders, ranking in top 1% of ETF launches with $33 million in trading volume. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Solana’s institutional appeal has surged, with data showing significant growth in both its staking Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) and Solana CME futures markets. The impressive performance translated into a 5% rise in SOL’s value in the last 24 hours to $155 as of press time, according to CryptoSlate’s data. The REX-Osprey Solana Staking ETF, known as SSK, achieved an impressive debut on June 2, drawing $12 million in inflows and generating $33 million in trading volume. Bloomberg’s ETF analyst Eric Balchunas highlighted that SSK’s first-day performance ranked in the top 1% for new ETF launches. Balchunas noted that the SSK’s $33 million trading volume on its opening day was exceptional, far outpacing the Solana and XRP futures ETFs. While the volume was much lower than Bitcoin and Ether ETFs, the result still indicates a robust investor interest in Solana. The analyst speculated that if the fund maintains its strong momentum, it could reach $10 million in assets under management by close of play today. As the first spot Solana ETF and the first staking ETF in the US, SSK offers a unique opportunity for investors to gain exposure to Solana while benefiting from staking yields. The fund aims to stake at least half of its assets to provide consistent yields to investors. However, SSK differs from the Bitcoin ETFs managed by BlackRock and others. SSK uses an Investment Company Act of 1940 structure, keeping more than 40 % of assets in foreign SOL ETPs to satisfy diversification rules. That makes it slightly different from the 33-Act spot Bitcoin/Ethereum ETFs, but the economic exposure is similar. VanEck, 21Shares, and others are still awaiting SEC approval on ‘true’ spot Solana ETFs, with analysts giving ~95 % odds they will clear by year-end. Meanwhile, the demand for Solana exposure is also evident in the performance of Solana CME futures. According to Coinglass data, open interest in these futures surged 13%, reaching an all-time high of $167 million. This marks a significant increase in institutional interest since Solana futures were first listed on the CME platform in March. The CME offers two types of Solana futures contracts, including the standard contracts (representing 500 SOL) and retail-friendly “micro” contracts (representing 25 SOL). These contracts are settled in cash rather than physical Solana, offering institutions a regulated method for gaining Solana exposure. The spike in open interest illustrates the rising institutional appetite for Solana-related financial products. However, this increased liquidity also brings the potential for greater volatility, as leveraged positions can lead to sharp price movements. The combination of a successful ETF launch and strong futures market activity is a clear signal of Solana’s growing institutional traction. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: Antitrust enforcer Gail Slater on American innovation: ‘We can win the AI race against the Chinese without becoming like China’
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/07/03/business/doj-antitrust-chief-is-betting-american-tech-will-beat-china/
Time Published: 2025-07-03T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
Gail Slater, Donald Trump’s head of antitrust, is tasked with a formidable agenda that requires precision: Foster a business-friendly environment that lets tech companies stay big enough to compete with China while ensuring they don’t become excessively dominant. “It’s about enforcing antitrust robustly in a way that works for all Americans … that’s my starting point,” Slater, 53, told me in her first interview since taking on her role as Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division at the Department of Justice a little over 100 days ago. Slater took over a serious docket of cases that includes suits against Google, in regards to search and ad tech; Apple, for its smartphone market dominance; Visa, in relation to debit card payment processing; and Live Nation/Ticketmaster and its live entertainment business. While she won’t comment on the status of those cases, she’s been a key advisor urging Trump to stay the course on antitrust enforcement — despite tech companies’ efforts to sway him. (When I asked how frequently she discusses agenda with President Trump, she told me, “We get a lot of signals from the White House in the form of Executive Orders.”) Slater is deeply committed and believes aggressive antitrust enforcement can benefit consumers in countless ways — even on seemingly unrelated issues. “Speech and the censorship of speech can be downstream of [tech companies] market power,” she noted. Not everyone on the right agrees with her. Some Republicans, like Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), believe the US government should tread lightly with tech companies. They worry that too much regulation could unintentionally give China a dangerous advantage when it comes to artificial intelligence. But Slater feels antitrust efforts could actually give the US a leg-up. “Companies competing against one another innovate. That’s the free market at its finest,” she explained. “We can win the AI race against the Chinese without becoming like China… we will win the global race to AI the American way.” Bringing cases against massive companies can cost millions, making Slater’s job — at a time when everyone in the federal government is under the gun to cut costs — especially challenging. “The big tech cases alone are a huge, huge lift, both from a human resource standpoint, a scale standpoint when it comes to documents and experts and how we put those cases on a trial,” Slater said. This story is part of NYNext, an indispensable insider insight into the innovations, moonshots and political chess moves that matter most to NYC’s power players (and those who aspire to be). Her efforts, she said, have to be “low resource, high return on investment things.” And even though she is focused on ending unfair monopolies, she’s also trying to implement as many pro-business policies as she can. On the front end, Slater is now allowing early terminations to the (previously) mandatory 30-day waiting period for mergers to close on deals the DOJ deems benign. Since taking the helm, she has granted 58 of 322 filings, worth $71 billion. “In particular, we are taking settlements in merger cases where the previous administration took none,” she said. At the back end of deals, she has embraced the use of consent decrees — allowing parties to resolve competitive overlaps by divesting assets to qualified buyers, a practice the prior administration largely avoided. “We listened hard to concerns that Wall Street and others had about the policy of the prior administration on deal flow,” she told me of efforts to simplify rules where she can. “We inherited a historic docket and we want to be responsible stewards of that, But we’re also setting [the agenda] by fixing the merger review process to make it more transparent, to make work better for deal makers.” Slater, who is soft-spoken, jokes “this is me raising my voice” when talking about the efforts they’ve already made to cut over-regulation. She has also teamed up with the Federal Trade Commission to eradicate what she describes as “useless” regulations. “We opened up a docket and we said to anybody interested with expertise in the area, tell us the regulations that you’re aware that are hindering competition — and the ways in which that could be fixed. Because we want to support free market competition,” Slater said. “That’s the goal here.” Another tool is using amicus briefs to strategically influence federal court cases, like they have done in Texas v. BlackRock — a high-profile antitrust lawsuit where states allege major investors like BlackRock colluded to reduce coal production, raising energy prices. She said it is a way of supporting American companies and administration policies with relatively inexpensive but high-impact interventions. Slater, who was born in Dublin and studied at Oxford, moved to the US in 2003 and worked as a trial attorney at the FTC for a decade. She held positions at the Internet Association, Fox Corporation, Roku and, during the first Trump administration, the National Economic Council, before advising JD Vance on antitrust issues while he was an Ohio senator. She’s excited moving beyond the cases left to her by her predecessor. “A priority for me is health care,” she told me. “We’re looking to set a positive agenda around drug pricing and health care more broadly.

Ethereum finds its footing, but is it enough for lift-off? As the broader market shifts back into bullish territory, short-sellers are being systematically flushed out across major assets. Ethereum [ETH] followed suit. A sharp 6.78% daily gain on the 2nd of July drove ETH back to the $2,600 level, liquidating nearly $90 million in short positions in the process. The real question now is whether ETH can convert this reclaimed level into a springboard for continuation. Risk appetite appears to be returning, elevating the stakes for Ethereum’s next move. Ethereum’s daily structure reveals a clear inflection point. On the 12th of June, Open Interest (OI) hit a record $41.75 billion, coinciding with ETH reclaiming the $2,800 level for the first time since February. However, beneath the surface, stress signals began to emerge. Despite steady spot demand, the number of whale wallets holding more than 10,000 ETH dropped to just 884, marking its lowest level since 2016. This sharp decline triggered aggressive deleveraging, with over $20 billion in OI unwound in under three weeks. The aftermath was a classic bull trap. While Bitcoin[BTC] corrected 10.8% over the following two weeks, ETH plunged 24.6% to $2,113. Source: TradingView (ETH/USDT) Yet, a rebound that followed marked a key shift in price behavior. ETH rallied 8.28% the very next day and slipped into a tight holding pattern between $2,400 and $2,500 for ten straight sessions. This kind of sideways action after a major flush often hints at quiet accumulation. If that’s what’s playing out here, Ethereum’s clean reclaim of the $2,600 level could represent a strategic pivot, laying the foundation for a sustained breakout with real positioning behind it. As Ethereum pushes through a critical supply overhang, market structure enters a sensitive zone. At the time of writing, Binance’s Long/Short Ratio was locked at 50:50. That kind of balance rarely lasts, and if bears sense weakness or holding pressure, shorts could quickly take over. This makes order book behavior especially important to watch. On the 2nd of July alone, whales rotated over $3 billion in ETH liquidity: 45,155 ETH flowed out of Kraken, while 60,000 ETH moved from Arbitrum to Binance. Source: CryptoQuant Meanwhile, BlackRock continues to accumulate quietly, having added ETH-related positions on 29 of the last thirty trading days. Structurally, Ethereum’s fundamentals are heating up too. Daily transactions have surged to 1.45 million, on par with 2021 bull cycle peaks, while DeFi lending is up 43% this quarter, reflecting renewed capital deployment. This backdrop reinforces that Ethereum’s breakout above $2,600 is structurally driven. If sustained, it sets the stage for another short squeeze, potentially targeting a move toward $2,800.

Title: First Solana ETF Goes Live, Hinting At A Potential Boom For Altcoin Funds

Time Published: 2025-07-03T09:00:10Z

The altcoin market is making significant inroads into traditional finance, with the recent launch of the first Solana ETF on the Cboe BZX stock exchange in Chicago. Named the REX-Osprey SOL and Staking ETF, this fund is designed for investors looking to gain exposure to Solana. In addition to tracking Solana’s price movements, the fund also offers a variable monthly dividend, currently set at 7.3%. Following this Solana ETF debut on Wednesday, SOL’s price surged by 2%, reaching around $152, while the investment vehicle attracted about $20 million in inflows by midday, as noted by Greg King, CEO of REX Financial. This launch marks a notable shift in how retail investors can access cryptocurrency assets, particularly at a time when many brokerages, such as Vanguard, do not facilitate direct purchases on crypto exchanges. The emergence of cryptocurrency ETFs, which serve as traditional market wrappers for digital assets, is increasingly appealing to both individual and institutional investors. Initially perceived as niche products, the introduction of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs last year have notably paved the way for broader acceptance of the crypto market, culminating in the arrival of Solana’s fund. These ETFs not only provide a means for new investors to enter the crypto space but also allow for portfolio diversification without the need to navigate the complexities of direct cryptocurrency purchases. For years, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) stymied the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs, citing concerns over potential market manipulation. However, a pivotal ruling in October 2023 deemed the SEC’s rejections of Grayscale’s application for a Bitcoin ETF “arbitrary and capricious,” leading to a wave of new products in early 2024. Major financial players, including BlackRock, Fidelity and VanEck, entered the market with their own spot Bitcoin ETFs, contributing to an influx of nearly $50 billion into these investment vehicles. Following the success of Bitcoin ETFs, BlackRock and other firms rolled out Ethereum ETFs in July 2024, prompting additional applications for various other cryptocurrencies such as XRP, Cardano (ADA), and Litecoin (LTC), with Solana included. King noted that under a more favorable regulatory environment with President Donald Trump’s approach toward digital assets, a significant increase in ETF approvals from the SEC could be expected, particularly as the financial landscape shifts with the current administration. As reported by Bitcoinist on Tuesday, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas have raised their projections for the approval of single-asset spot crypto ETFs, now estimating a 95% chance of approval by the end of 2025. Seyffart expressed optimism about a forthcoming wave of new exchange-traded funds in the latter half of 2025, signaling a transformative period for the integration of cryptocurrency into mainstream finance.

Title: UK bond rout draws Truss comparisons
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2025/0703/1521608-uk-bond-rout-draws-truss-comparisons/

British government bonds tumbled sharply yesterday as a tearful appearance by Chancellor Rachel Reeves in parliament a day after the government backed down on its welfare reforms reignited concern over Britain's finances. Reeves was attending Prime Minister's Questions following the government's decision to sharply scale back plans to cut benefits. The sharp plunge in British assets immediately drew comparisons with Liz Truss' short-lived premiership nearly three years ago, which was derailed by a bond market selloff. Investors are monitoring Reeves' status after the UK government's reversal on welfare reforms meant the plans would no longer save taxpayers any money, shredding the margin Britain relies on to meet its fiscal rules. The welfare reform U-turn was "signalling that the Labour Party is a lot less concerned about what the gilt market thinks," said Gordon Shannon, portfolio manager, TwentyFour Asset Management. "I would have thought it was seared into politicians' memories what happened to Liz Truss," he added. The yield on the 10-year government bond, or gilt, rose as much as 22 basis points on the day at one point, to 4.681%, as investors ditched British debt. It then recovered somewhat to 4.60%. At its peak, the benchmark yield was set for its largest one-day jump since October 2022, the aftermath of Truss' chaotic package of large, unfunded tax cuts that scuttled her premiership. During the depths of the 2022 crisis, the yield on the 10-year gilt rose by 50 bps in a single day at one point. The selloff also hit very long dated gilts, and 30-year yields rose 17 basis points. "The latest headline would suggest more uncertainty with regards to the current government," said Simon Blundel, head of European fundamental fixed income investments at BlackRock.

Investors in bonds around the world are growing increasingly nervous about government deficits from Japan to the US, with Britain seen as among the more vulnerable. Earlier yesterday, British assets were trading slightly lower, but the selloff intensified rapidly after Reeves appeared alongside Prime Minister Kier Starmer during the weekly prime minister's questions looking exhausted and upset. Traders also focused on comments from Starmer seemingly not endorsing Reeves, though Starmer's press secretary later said Reeves has his full support, and she was upset because of "a personal matter". Reeves has repeatedly emphasised her commitment to self-imposed fiscal rules, limiting the amount Britain will borrow, and, analysts said, yesterday's market moves reflected fears that she would be replaced, creating even more uncertainty. Reeves has also been blamed by some Labour members of parliament for pushing for billions of pounds of savings that were described as cruel and targeting the most vulnerable. Sterling dropped around 1% against the dollar and also weakened sharply against the euro, which rose 0.8% to its highest on the pound in two months. Britain's domestically focused mid-cap index was down 1.3% on the day, sharply underperforming European stocks. "The deficit is going to have to be closed somehow, clearly the signal from yesterday is that can't come from substantial spending cuts, I don’t think it’s possible for the government to borrow the money, that leaves tax rises," Nick Rees, head of macro research at Monex Europe, said. "It's a pretty ugly outlook for sterling," he added. Accreditation: Reuters © RTÉ 2025. RTÉ.ie is the website of Raidió Teilifís Éireann, Ireland's National Public Service Media.

Title: Jio-Blackrock will expand Indian stock market, but not a threat to first-generation founders, says Zerodhas Nitin Kamath

New Delhi [India], : If any company can expand the current market, it is Jio-Blackrock with its huge distribution network, but it will not be a threat to first generation founders noted online brokerage platform Zerodha's Chief Executive Officer , Nithin Kamath, on the social media platform 'X'.Nithin Kamath via his post on 'X' expressed optimism regarding the same. He said, "Many people asked me about Jio-BlackRock getting a stockbroking license. Firstly, this is great news." Kamath further added that, "If anyone can expand the markets beyond the top 10 crore Indians, it's probably Jio with all its distribution might."However, he also raised concerns about the expansion of the Indian stock market. "The biggest issue for the Indian markets is a lack of breadth in participation. We're largely limited to the top 10 crore Indians," he said.Kamath also shared his opinion on what his thoughts are on broking. He believes that Zerodha is not something which is following 'vanity metrics' and the principle online brokerage platform is to 'stay to stay profitable.' "At the heart of our philosophy is to always do the right thing for customers," Nithin Kamath said. Kamath also emphasised that Zerodha's strategy is not to pressure consumers to trade and to make sure that there are no obtrusive notifications, dark patterns, etc., adding that customers who trade less have a better chance of long-term success. However, Nithin Kamath also reflected on the role of other financial services businesses in the sector, who are constantly seeking to grow their business at any cost. "And yeah, I still feel our real competition is going to be more from first-generation founders who are running, breathing, and always thinking about broking. I somehow don't feel it will really come from incumbents. This is not a business where having deep pockets means you have a large moat," said Nithin Kamath.

ByForbes Press Releases ByForbes Press Releases, Forbes Staff. Red Bull’s Chalerm Yoovidhya & family retain top spot SINGAPORE (July 3, 2025) – The combined wealth of tycoons on the 2025 Forbes list of Thailand’s 50 Richest rose more than 11% to US$170.5 billion, despite slower-than-expected economic growth amid trade tensions and mounting political uncertainty. The complete list can be found here, as well as in the July issue of Forbes Asia and the August issue of Forbes Thailand. Overall, the net worths of nearly half the listees were up with the biggest dollar jump—$8.5 billion—recorded by the Red Bull family, led by Chalerm Yoovidhya. In the No. 1 position for the second year in a row, their wealth skyrocketed to a record $44.5 billion as annual revenue of the energy drinks giant rose to €11.2 billion ($12.9 billion) in 2024 on worldwide sales of nearly 13 billion cans. The Chearavanont brothers of the Charoen Pokphand group retained their position as the country’s second-richest with their net worth up by 23% to $35.7 billion. The group is doubling down on digital infrastructure, investing $1 billion with BlackRock to build data centers. The group’s fintech unit Ascend Money recently got approval to set up a virtual bank. Energy-and-telecoms tycoon Sarath Ratanavadi climbed two spots to No. 3 for the first time with $12 billion, up from $9.2 billion last year. Completing the merger between his Gulf Energy Development and Intouch Holdings and listing the combined entity in April as Gulf Development powered his ascent. Taking the No. 4 spot is beverage tycoon Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi, whose net worth was relatively flat at $10.5 billion. In a key move, the patriarch transferred some holdings to his five children but being the group founder, the fortune continues to be listed under his name. Rounding out the top five on the list is the Central Group’s Chirathivat family, who saw their wealth decline 13% to $8.6 billion, as weak consumer sentiment impacted the retail sector. A total of 19 listees faced a downdraft. Coffee magnate Prayudh Mahagitsiri’s (No. 18, $1.4 billion) wealth took a hit as his PM Group’s long-standing joint venture with Nestle ended. Two patriarchs passed away since the last ranking: Vanich Chaiyawan, chairman emeritus of Thai Life; and Pongsak Viddayakorn, cofounder of Bangkok Dusit Medical Services, who went on to build a separate healthcare business under Principal Capital. Their fortunes are now listed under the Chaiyawan family (No. 6, $4.2 billion) and the Viddayakorn family (No. 30, $1.1 billion). Four people fell from the ranks, including renewable energy magnate Somphote Ahunai, whose Energy Absolute faced financial stress. The minimum net worth to qualify for the list dropped to $420 million from last year’s $550 million. The top 10 richest in Thailand are: This list was compiled using shareholding and financial information obtained from the families and individuals, stock exchanges and analysts, the Stock Exchange of Thailand and regulatory agencies. Unlike the Forbes World’s Billionaires list rankings, this list encompasses family fortunes, including those shared among extended families of multiple generations. Public fortunes were calculated based on stock prices and exchange rates as on June 13. Private companies were valued based on comparisons with similar companies that are publicly traded. The list can also include foreign citizens with business, residential or other ties to the country, or citizens who don’t reside in the country but have significant business or other ties to the country.

The asset’s price has fallen 48% since it hit $293 in January, not long after the debut of U.S. President Donald Trump’s meme coin. Although the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to approve several crypto-focused ETFs this year, Wednesday’s debut represents a new chapter “in the crypto ETF story,” Anchorage Digital co-founder and CEO Nathan McCauley said in a statement. As the only U.S. federally chartered digital asset bank, Anchorage is safeguarding the ETF’s digital assets, while using its platform to stake the Solana. McCauley said that Anchorage’s innovation would hopefully translate to other products. “The launch of crypto staking ETFs marks a win for consumers and a significant step forward in full access to the crypto ecosystem,” he said. Anchorage began letting institutions stake Ethereum in the U.S. in 2022, not long before Ethereum transitioned to a proof-of-stake consensus model. In April, BlackRock tapped Anchorage as a custodian to safeguard some funds for its Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Anchorage’s services mirror a regular bank, but it’s allowed to hold cryptocurrencies on behalf of clients. As far as crypto ETFs in the U.S. go, many asset managers have chosen Coinbase as a custodian, including Grayscale Investments and Bitwise. Unlike spot crypto ETFs approved by the SEC last year, the Rex-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF is structured under the Investment Company Act. That distinction required a qualified custodian, like Anchorage, to hold the fund’s assets. On Wednesday, the Rex-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF got off to a “healthy start,” Bloomberg ETF Analyst James Seyffart wrote on X, formerly Twitter, pointing to $8 million in trading volume that the fund notched in its first 20 minutes.

The Chearavanont brothers’ agribusiness-to-telecoms conglomerate Charoen Pokphand Group (CP Group) has lately been on a digital and regional expansion drive. In June, its fintech arm Ascend Money secured approval to establish a virtual bank, which paves the way for the firm to leverage its digital platform TrueMoney, with its countrywide base of 34 million users. ss A month earlier, True IDC, the data center and cloud services arm of the group’s telecoms giant True, which is led by its chairman Suphachai Chearavanont, teamed up with a BlackRock unit to invest $1 billion over the next three to five years to build data centers in Thailand, an up and coming ASEAN digital hub. After its 2023 merger with rival Total Access Communications, True is now the country’s largest mobile operator with nearly 49 million subscribers. With an eye on regional expansion, CP Group will be setting up a $1 billion private equity fund with Philippine sovereign wealth fund Maharlika Investment Corp. to invest in agriculture, digital innovation and renewable energy in the Philippines. Over the past 12 months, the net worth of the Chearavanont brothers has gone up by $6.7 billion to $35.7 billion.

This story is part of Forbes’ coverage of Thailand’s Richest 2025. See the full list here. Thailand’s economy is growing at a slower-than-expected pace amid trade tensions and mounting political uncertainty. While a stronger baht mostly offset the 14% decline of the stock market index from a year ago, a huge boost in the fortunes of the top three propelled a more than 11% rise in combined wealth to $170.5 billion. ss Overall, the net worths of nearly half the listees were up with the biggest dol­lar jump—$8.5 billion—recorded by the Red Bull family, led by Chalerm Yoovidhya. In the No. 1 position for the second year in a row, their wealth skyrocketed to a record $44.5 billion as annual revenue of the energy drinks giant rose to €11.2 billion ($12.9 billion) in 2024 on worldwide sales of nearly 13 billion cans.

In a key move, the patriarch transferred some holdings to his five children in May but being the group founder, the fortune continues to be listed under his name. Amid weak consumer sentiment in the retail sector, the Chirathivat family’s wealth was down 13% to $8.6 billion. Last October, the group got a new partner: Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund acquired a 40% stake in British retailer Selfridges from Austria’s Signa Holdings. (Central group retains 60%.) A total of 19 listees faced a downdraft. Coffee magnate Prayudh Mahagitsiri’s wealth took a hit as his PM Group’s long-standing joint venture with Nestle ended. Two patriarchs died since the last ranking: Vanich Chaiyawan, chairman emeritus of insurance giant Thai Life; and Pongsak Viddayakorn, cofounder of hospital chain Bangkok Dusit Medical Services, who went on to build a separate healthcare business under Principal Capital. Their fortunes are now listed under the Chaiyawan family and the Viddayakorn family. Though the minimum net worth to qualify for the list dropped to $420 million from last year’s $550 million, four people fell from the ranks.

Global bank JPMorgan’s blockchain arm Kinexys is working with S&P Global Commodity Insights to explore tokenization for managing and issuing carbon credits, the firms said on Wednesday. The project, according to a press release, focuses on testing how tokenized carbon credits can be created and tracked using blockchain infrastructure. These credits, which represent greenhouse gas reductions from projects like reforestation or renewable energy, are often bought by companies aiming to offset their emissions. The firms will focus on how blockchain handles credit lifecycle management, data compatibility and registry access. "Our shared aim is to establish standardized infrastructure that enhances information and price transparency, paving the way for financial innovation and increased market liquidity," said Keerthi Moudgal, head of product at Kinexys Digital Assets. The initiative underscores JPMorgan's growing presence in the red-hot tokenization space, a sector that has attracted global banks and asset managers such as BlackRock, HSBC and Citi. Tokenization is the process of using blockchain rails to transact with traditional financial instruments, promising more efficient operations, around-the-clock settlements and increased transparency. JPMorgan has been an early leader operating its own private blockchain network Kinexys, formerly known as Onyx and JPM Coin, which now settles $2 billion in daily transactions, according to the bank. It also piloted last month a deposit token called JPMD on Base, an Ethereum layer-2 network developed by Coinbase.

Title: Solana’s first ETF goes live as crypto analysts predict surge of new altcoin funds

Ben Weiss is a crypto reporter at Fortune. First Bitcoin, then Ethereum, and now Solana. The crypto industry is flooding traditional markets with assets pegged to cryptocurrencies that mom-and-pop investors can buy up from their brokerage accounts. On Wednesday morning, the first Solana exchange-traded fund, or ETF, went live on Cboe BZX, a stock exchange based in Chicago. Dubbed the REX-Osprey SOL and Staking ETF, the fund is available to investors who want exposure to Solana, one of the top cryptocurrencies whose market capitalization is about $81 billion, according to data from Binance. In addition to tracking the price of Solana, the fund, managed jointly by REX Financial and its sister firm Osprey Funds, also pays holders a variable monthly dividend whose current rate is 7.3% The price of Solana jumped 2% after markets opened Wednesday to now around $151. The ETF has seen inflows of about $20 million before midday, Greg King, founder and CEO of REX Financial, told Fortune. When they were first launched, cryptocurrency ETFs seemed exotic to many retail investors, but the successive debut of a Bitcoin, Ethereum, and now a Solana fund suggest the products are gaining a broader appeal. The ETFs also represent an entry point for new crypto investors at a time when brokerages like Vanguard don’t let their users plug into a crypto exchange and buy the newest, hottest token. The arrival of spot crypto ETFs, or traditional market wrappers around the current price of a cryptocurrency, allow traditional and institutional investors to allocate a portion of their portfolio to crypto. For years, the Securities and Exchange Commission blocked the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., even though similar products were available in Europe. The SEC worried that the crypto-tied assets would be prone to market manipulation. Grayscale, a crypto investment firm, battled the regulator in the courts, and, in October 2023, a judge said the SEC’s rejections of Grayscale’s application for a spot Bitcoin ETF were “arbitrary and capricious.” In January 2024, a slew of spot Bitcoin ETFs went live, including an entry into the category from the asset management titan BlackRock. Since the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs, almost $50 billion have poured into the investment products, according to data from SoSoValue. In July 2024, BlackRock and other issuers launched ETFs for Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. And then, other issuers filed ETF applications for a slew of other cryptocurrencies, including Solana. “I frankly think it would have been more difficult with the previous administration,” said King, the CEO of REX Financial. Now, amid a more friendly financial regime under President Donald Trump, analysts anticipate that the SEC will approve many of the applications to launch cryptocurrency-tied funds. “We expect a wave of new ETFs in this second half of 2025,” James Seyffart, a research analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said on X. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Ethereum ETFs forecast to attract $10 billion by late 2025, says Bitwise CIO

Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan foresees Ethereum ETFs surging due to easy adoption via tokenized stocks and stablecoins. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan predicted that Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could experience up to $10 billion in inflows during the second half of 2025. His forecast, made on July 2, builds on the strong momentum observed over the past months, with Ethereum ETFs already bringing in $1.17 billion in inflows in June alone. According to SoSoValue data, Ethereum ETFs have seen total inflows of approximately $1.5 billion for the first half of 2025, despite a brief dip in March when $403 million was pulled out. These funds have recorded inflows in five of the year’s first six months, underlining the sustained investor interest and bolstering Hougan’s optimistic outlook for the remainder of the year. Hougan attributes the growing interest in Ethereum to its expanding role as a platform for tokenized assets, including stocks and stablecoins. The Bitwise executive believes that integrating these assets onto Ethereum provides a straightforward narrative that traditional investors can easily grasp. According to him: “Flows into Ethereum ETFs are going to accelerate significantly in H2. The combination of stablecoins & stocks moving over Ethereum is an easy-to-grasp narrative for traditional investors.” Ethereum has firmly established itself as the backbone of the crypto industry. Its dominance in the stablecoin market and increasing adoption by major institutions like BlackRock and Robinhood for asset tokenization have made it a key player in the sector. Meanwhile, the anticipated approval of staking-enabled Ethereum ETFs will be another major catalyst for Ethereum ETF growth in the year’s second half. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently clarified that crypto staking does not qualify as securities offerings. Market observers believe this guidance paves the way for new Ethereum-based financial products, which would attract more attention to the current spot ETFs. Additionally, the Ethereum network itself is undergoing significant upgrades, with the Ethereum Foundation focusing on scalability through developments like the Pectra upgrade and the upcoming Glamsterdam release. Market observers believe these enhancements will solidify Ethereum’s infrastructure and position the network for long-term success. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) is now generating more revenue than one of the asset manager’s most iconic products, the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV), according to Bloomberg data. Despite having just $52 billion in AUM — a fraction of IVV’s $624 billion in total assets — IBIT’s higher fee structure has turned it into a bigger moneymaker for the world’s largest asset manager. Bloomberg estimates that IBIT brings in roughly $187.2 million annually through its 0.25% management fee. By comparison, IVV, which tracks the S&P 500 and has been a staple in retail and institutional portfolios for years, charges just 0.03%. That means it generates around $187.1 million in annual fees, despite managing roughly nine times more in assets than IBIT. IBIT launched in January 2024 as part of a wave of spot bitcoin ETFs approved by U.S. regulators. Since then, the fund has seen inflows every month except one, amassing $52 billion in assets to date. That makes it the largest spot bitcoin ETF on the market by a wide margin. The rapid growth of IBIT highlights the ongoing demand for regulated bitcoin investment products, particularly those offered by established financial firms like BlackRock. For investors, the appeal lies in gaining exposure to bitcoin without the technical hurdles or security risks of holding the asset directly. While IBIT’s management fee is higher than more traditional ETFs, it reflects the added complexity, custody and regulatory requirements involved in offering exposure to a digital asset like bitcoin.

Title: BlackRock Bitcoin ETF drives more revenue than its S&P 500 fund
URL: https://fortune.com/crypto/2025/07/02/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-revenue-sp-500-fund/
Time Published: 2025-07-02T16:23:09Z

At the world’s biggest asset manager, a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund now generates more revenue than its signature tracker of the S&P 500 Index. The roughly $75 billion iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (ticker IBIT) has seen a torrent of cash from institutional and retail investors alike, drawing inflows in all but one of the last 18 months. With an expense ratio of 0.25%, the fund brings in an estimated $187.2 million in annual fees, based on back-of-the-envelope math calculated by Bloomberg as of July 1. That slightly edges out the $187.1 million made by BlackRock’s iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV), which is nearly nine times larger at around $624 billion in assets, and charges just 0.03%. “IBIT overtaking IVV in annual fee revenue is reflective of both the surging investor demand for Bitcoin and the significant fee compression in core equity exposure,” said Nate Geraci, president at NovaDius Wealth Management. “Although spot Bitcoin ETFs are priced very competitively, IBIT is proof that investors are willing to pay up for exposures they view as truly additive to their portfolios.” BlackRock declined to comment. Since spot Bitcoin ETFs started trading in Jan. 2024, IBIT has attracted $52 billion of the combined $54 billion in net inflows, and it holds more than 55% of all Bitcoin ETF assets, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Meanwhile, the 25-year-old IVV is the third-largest ETF among the more than 4,300 products in the US, only trailing Vanguard Group and State Street Investment Management funds that also track the S&P 500. A surge of cash rushed into Bitcoin ETFs after US regulators reluctantly opened the door to mainstream adoption, prompting an influx of capital from hedge funds, pensions and banks. IBIT, which has an expense ratio similar to its peers, is already a top-20 ETF by trading volume, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. “It’s an indication of how much pent-up demand there was for investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin as part of their overall portfolio without having to open a separate account somewhere else,” said Paul Hickey, cofounder of Bespoke Investment Group. “It also illustrates the leadership of Bitcoin in the crypto space where it’s perceived utility as a store of value has essentially left the others in its dust.” Bitcoin’s supremacy over smaller altcoins has widened, with the world’s largest cryptocurrency trading above $100,000, propelled by President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance. Wall Street’s buying spree has been led by Michael Saylor’s Strategy, which has used its cash to accumulate a mountain of Bitcoin. Hedge funds have also piled into the firm’s convertible debt, capitalizing on arbitrage trades that involve buying the bonds while shorting the stock. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Bolt’s millennial founder has just ‘killed’ its unlimited PTO perk because it was actually causing burnout

Time Published: 2025-07-02T15:43:35Z
Full Content:
Preston Fore is a reporter at Fortune, covering education and personal finance for the Success team. On paper, unlimited PTO sounds like the holy grail of benefits a company can offer its employees—the ability to take endless vacations and avoid burnout. But for the $11 billion fintech startup Bolt, (not to be confused with the Uber rival, also called Bolt), unlimited PTO has been a double-edged sword that has caused more problems than solutions. “We just killed unlimited PTO at Bolt,” its founder and CEO, Ryan Breslow has just revealed on LinkedIn. “It sounds progressive, but it’s totally broken. When time off is undefined, the good ones don’t take PTO. The bad ones take too much.” While this is contrary to research from financial services firm Empower, which found that employees with unlimited PTO take on average 16 days off versus 14 days for those with limited policies, Breslow said much of that time was taken off by “b performers”—leaving high performers to pick up the slack. “This leads to A-performer burnout. B-performer luxuries. And feelings of unfairness across the board,” the millennial boss explained. “So we’re flipping the script: no more confusion. Every Bolter now gets four weeks of paid vacation (yes, the traditional corporate standard), with the opportunity to accrue more with tenure. Not optional,” Breslow added. “We mandate everyone take all four weeks off.” Now, the company is capping annual leave at around four weeks—but Bolt workers can accrue a maximum of 25 days leave with tenure. “We believe a team executing at the pace and scale we do deserves real, protected time off, not vague promises,” a Bolt spokesperson echoed in a statement to Fortune. “When we saw in our own data that our A-players weren’t taking enough time away, we knew we had to fix it.” Breslow rejoined Bolt this year after a rocky few months that included rounds of layoffs and a failed fundraising attempt that carried a $14 billion valuation. It was last valued at $11 billion in 2022, with investment coming from top firms like BlackRock. Reshaping Bolt’s culture has been a centrepiece of the 31-year-old’s changes since retaking the helm in March. On top of the PTO change, Breslow also publicly announced the company was doing away with its HR department in favor of “people ops”—which is more focused on efficiency over fluff, he wrote on LinkedIn. “HR is the wrong energy, format, and approach,” he said. “People ops empowers managers, streamlines decision making, and keeps the company moving at lightning speed.” The company also had some wins in recent weeks, including securing partnerships with Klarna and Palantir, but the only way to make sure that continues to happen, Breslow said, is to ensure top talent can thrive. “If we’re asking people to move fast, build hard, and operate at the highest level, we need to protect their recovery time with the same intensity,” Breslow said. “Execution requires clarity. That applies to PTO, too.” Despite growing calls from workers for better work-life balance and indications that unlimited PTO could lead to outperforming the S&P 500, the policy remains embraced by just 7% of employers, according to SHRM. Netflix is considered to be an early pioneer of the policy. Reed Hastings, the billionaire cofounder of the streaming service, has said he takes six weeks of vacation each year—and encourages his employees to do the same. “I take a lot of vacation and I’m hoping that certainly sets an example,” the former Netflix CEO said in 2015. “It is helpful. You often do your best thinking when you’re off hiking in some mountain or something. You get a different perspective on things.” Today, the company claims to not have a strict 9-to-5 workday–or even holiday schedule—and encourages workers to take time off to observe what’s important and when their mind and body need a break. More than a quarter of workers, or 26%, say they would consider a lower-paying job if it offered the unlimited option. At the same time, shifting to the policy has sometimes backfired. In 2014, Tribune Publishing—the company behind the Chicago Tribune and formerly the Los Angeles Times—attempted to transition from limited to unlimited PTO, but faced backlash from its employees. Less than two weeks later, the publisher reversed course after receiving “valuable input from employees,” citing that the new policy actually just “created confusion and concern within the company.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: 'Not A Business Where Deep Pockets Mean A Large Moat': Nithin Kamath On Jio-Blackrock

Zerodha Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder Nithin Kamath said on Wednesday that he does not see a competitive threat from the mutual funds and investment company Jio-Blackrock receiving a stock-broking license. Jio-Blackrock was formed as a 50:50 joint venture between telecommunication company Jio an arm of Reliance Industries Ltd., and Blackrock, the world's largest asset manager, based in the US. The company paired Jio's digital reach and interconnected software service networks with Blackrock's 'Alladin Platform' to provide tech-driven analytics to customers. Many people asked me about Jio-BlackRock getting a stockbroking license. Firstly, this is great news. The biggest issue for the Indian markets is a lack of breadth in participation. We're largely limited to the top 10 crore Indians.If anyone can expand the markets beyond theâ¦ Kamath, in a post on social media platform X, said he sees primary competition coming in from first-generation founders who he described as "running, breathing, and always thinking about broking". "This is not a business where having deep pockets means you have a large moat," the co-founder of the discount brokerage firm said. Kamath said that Jio-Blackrock may expand the breadth in participation for investments saying that it is largely limited to 10 crore Indians. "If anyone can expand the markets beyond the top 10 crore Indians, it's probably Jio with all its distribution might," he said. The joint venture reportedly aims to provide its services to people across various income groups to reach those consumers who don't usually have the capital to invest by offering low-risk investment plans with a minimum investment of Rs 500. Kamath said that Zerodha was not chasing "vanity metrics" and isn't focused on using plans to draw customers in and changing the pricing structure once they have them. He enumerated the firm's principal philosophy as being against pushing customers to invest and making sure they don't have unnecessary notifications or dark patterns. "We understand that in the long term, the odds of success are better if customers trade less; most of our product decisions are based on this," he said. He said the company was "in it for the long haul" and focused on providing product offerings that help their customers grow. "I don't know if you can say the same about many other financial services businesses in the industry, who are constantly looking to grow at any cost," Kamath said.

Title: JP Morgan’s blockchain unit plans to tokenise carbon credits

Time Published: 2025-07-02T13:34:36Z

JPMorgan Chase & Co. is taking steps to modernize the voluntary carbon market by testing a new blockchain-based system for tokenizing carbon credits. The initiative is being led by Kinexys, the bank’s blockchain unit, in collaboration with S&P Global Commodity Insights, EcoRegistry, and the International Carbon Registry. The goal is to determine whether blockchain technology can effectively track the ownership and lifecycle of carbon credits from issuance through retirement. Tokenization is the process of representing real-world assets as digital tokens on a blockchain, has gained traction across Wall Street. Institutions like BlackRock and Deutsche Bank have explored their use to simplify and accelerate the settlement of traditional financial assets such as stocks and bonds. By applying this technology to carbon credits, JPMorgan and its partners aim to address persistent challenges in the carbon market, including inefficiency, lack of transparency, market fragmentation, and the absence of standardized systems. According to JPMorgan, a unified tokenized ecosystem could enable carbon credits to move seamlessly between buyers and sellers, improving overall market functionality. Alastair Northway, head of natural resource advisory at JPMorgan Payments, believes the voluntary carbon market is “ripe for innovation.” He emphasized that blockchain tokenization could underpin a more transparent and interoperable global system, potentially increasing liquidity and trust in the market. Enhanced visibility into pricing and project data is one potential benefit of adopting digital infrastructure. A carbon credit typically signifies one metric ton of carbon dioxide that has either been removed from or not released into the atmosphere. These credits often originate from renewable energy or forestry projects. In a tokenized system, each credit would exist as a digital asset on a blockchain, offering a verifiable and tradable representation of the environmental benefit. Despite growing institutional and governmental interest in carbon trading, the market has struggled with credibility issues. Allegations of greenwashing and shortcomings in project effectiveness have raised doubts about the integrity of some carbon offset programs. JPMorgan itself has previously financed carbon projects and purchased carbon removal credits and now aims to be recognized as the “carbon bank of choice.” In a report released Wednesday, JPMorgan noted that while carbon credits are “poised to mature as market infrastructure strengthens,” that outcome is far from guaranteed. The bank warned that failure to address market integrity issues or foster innovation could further damage confidence in a market that has recently stalled after a period of contraction. The report also referenced earlier efforts by other organizations to tokenize carbon credits, some of which raised concerns about double-counting and transactions involving already-retired credits. Such missteps have undermined trust and highlighted the need for more robust frameworks to support digital carbon markets. As part of this new trial, JPMorgan and its partners aim to avoid those pitfalls by working with established registry systems and prioritizing accountability and traceability.

Title: “What If” US Bombing of Iran Was Not What Meets the Eye? Peter Koenig

Unconfirmed reports from different sources paint a different scenario from the ones that have made the mainstream, as well as non-mainstream news about President Trump’s intervention in Iran, bombing of nuclear research sites, as described in this article and this. Since nothing is confirmed or proven, however to some extent credible, let us approach this topic with “What If”…. What if previous assessments of President Trump’s actions on Iran are wrong? What if before June 22, when the United States Air Force and Navy attacked three Iranian nuclear research facilities: Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan, in an operation called “Midnight Hammer”, President Trump told / warned Iran of the attack, so that they could evacuate all the nuclear material and people from the sites? Therefore, it would appear, no enriched material (up to 60% according to the IAEA) was destroyed. This may be the reason why the IAEA reported no radiation after the attack. Also, apparently nobody was killed or hurt during the attack. Trump also informed Putin of his plan. What if the plan was telling Israel that he, President Trump, would take care of the nuclear “danger”, and Israel should stop aggressing Iran and possibly causing a nuclear WWIII? There was no more reason after 22 June to attack Iran. This was supposed to be good for Israel because the damage Iran’s retaliatory missile strikes on Israel was devastating. The truth of the damage has not (yet) come out in the western media. Also, Israel’s Air Defense System was made almost useless by Iranian drone attacks. Apparently, that’s why Israel agreed to a ceasefire, which was broken or not broken by both parties, depending whom to believe, but it may have been the reason why Trump exclaimed “They are stupid”, before he boarded the plane to the G7 farce in Canada. Iran also used her “homemade” Fattah-1, Iran’s first hypersonic missile which is claimed to be capable of penetrating advanced missile defenses. It has a range of 1,400 kilometers and is reported to reach speeds of Mach 14. Iran may have used a few Fattah-1 to cause considerable damage to Tel Aviv, Haifa, and possibly even Israeli nuclear sites. Image: Zardari in 2024 (CC BY 4.0) What if President Trump also spoke with Pakistan’s President, Asif Ali Zardari, a US-implant – if Israel uses nukes on Iran, Pakistan was free to “help” Iran, while Israel was also made aware of this possibility? Pakistan nor Israel is part of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). What if Trump’s idea was indeed to avoid a nuclear WWIII with this maneuver; converting a potential atomic WWIII into a 10-day war? Full Stop. From 13 June, when the Israeli unprovoked, surprise-missile-attacked Iran, to 22 June 2025, when the US bombing of the three nuclear research sites, Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan, was done and over. Maybe that is also the reason, encouraged by Pakistani’s President, Asif Ali Zardari, why Trump was boasting lately and loudly that he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize. Who knows? What if he will get it? Obama got it, before he did anything. Then he started, enhanced, and continued six new and existing wars; did not stop one. What if – has of course quite a few elements of speculation. But strategically, it would make sense. Wait and see what happens next on the Middle East / Western Asia front. Still unresolved is the Israeli genocide on Gaza and the apparently “never-ending” Ukraine [US-NATO] – Russia war. The former cannot even be categorized anymore as genocide, as a violation of International Law, an infraction of Human Rights – it is systematic, targeted killing, slaughter, ethnic cleansing, and outright expulsion from their land. The latter is Big Business for BlackRock, literally privatizing Ukraine, and the War industry, contributing mightily to the West’s GDP [a linear western invention to categorize world economies] – since destruction leads to construction, thus growth. What if – the West is doomed. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article. Follow us on Instagram and X and subscribe to our Telegram Channel.

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. Bitcoin and crypto prices have traded sideways since May—even as U.S. president Donald Trump’s crypto czar predicts a “big” July—after it surged through the first few months of Trump’s second presidency. Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price is up almost double from July last year, with predictions of “trillions and trillions” of dollars still on the sidelines helping to fuel sky-high bitcoin price bets. Now, as a "huge" BlackRock crypto market bombshell suddenly appears on the horizon, the U.S. M2 money supply has hit a record $22 trillion—named by analysts as a potential catalyst for a bitcoin price breakout. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run U.S. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has said interest rates would have come down this year if ... More not for Donald Trump's global trade tariffs—something that some think could further boost the bitcoin price. "As M2 money supply begins to rise again, history suggests that a portion of this liquidity will flow into bitcoin and other digital assets," Matt Mena, crypto research strategist at 21Shares, said in emailed comments. Historically, the bitcoin price has tracked the M2 money supply, which is the Federal Reserve’s estimate of liquid assets, including cash, money deposited in checking accounts, savings accounts, and other short-term saving vehicles such as money market funds. "If bitcoin continues to follow money supply growth, we could see $150,000 per coin before year end," Anthony “Pomp” Pompliano, a crypto influencer who’s set to lead a new bitcoin acquisition company, wrote in an emailed note. The increase in the M2 money supply comes as Fed chair Jerome Powell continues to argue the case for keeping interest rates on hold.

More supply. “In effect we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs," Powell said this week during a conference panel discussion, it was reported by The Guardian newspaper, referring to Trump’s Liberation Day of trade tariffs that sent shockwaves through the global economy. "Essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs. We didn’t overreact, in fact we didn’t react at all. We’re simply taking some time.” Last month, the Fed kept interest rates on hold again after kicking of a reduction cycle in September, despite a growing number of Fed officials arguing for rate cuts. “It’s clear that the Fed expects inflation to continue above target,” David Morrison, senior market analyst at Trade Nation, said in emailed comments. “That being the case, it sounds as if the Fed will only cut rates if the U.S. employment situation deteriorates significantly.”

Title: Crypto ETFs Are Diversifying. Can Demand Keep Up?
URL: https://www.thedailyupside.com/etf/thematics-sectors/crypto-etfs-are-diversifying-can-demand-keep-up/

Numerous products have been awaiting approval by the SEC, and more, such as an index-based crypto ETF, are in development. Emile Hallez emile@thedailyupside.com What the world needs now is … another crypto ETF? That may be what asset managers are hoping. The list of would-be products seeking the Securities and Exchange Commission’s approval keeps growing. One of the latest proposed ETFs, from KraneShares, would invest across a considerable range of crypto assets. That fund, the KraneShares CF Large Cap Crypto Index ETF, for which the firm filed a registration statement for SEC review last Friday, would hold bitcoin, ether, XRP, Solana, Dogecoin, Cardano and Hedera, according to the initial prospectus. And another firm, Bitwise, filed last week for three products that would expand its crypto coverage: The Bitwise Bitcoin & Ethereum ETF; Bitwise Aptos ETF; and Bitwise Dogecoin ETF. In the short history of the crypto ETF market, sales and assets have been dominated by a few players, most notably BlackRock, whose iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF represents nearly $75 billion. That hasn’t stopped companies from developing new ETFs, but there is a question about demand. “[For] your average investor, only 8% are concerned about adding crypto products to their portfolios,” said Stephen Caruso, associate director of wealth management at Cerulli Associates. The SEC has yet to approve a range of spot-price crypto ETFs. Regardless, the product space has branched out since the first bitcoin ETFs were approved in 2024. There are iterations of income-focused bitcoin ETFs, for example, and firms are preparing funds that offer staking capabilities, in the case of Solana and other crypto assets. There is increasing interest among retail investors in crypto ETFs broadly, and that can translate to opportunities for conversation with financial advisors, Caruso said. For example, about 20% of retail investors who haven’t worked with advisors before, but are strongly considering doing so, are interested in crypto ETFs, he said. Survey data show that demand for crypto ETFs varies by age and wealth: Competing for That Coin: “Crypto is not one-size-fits-all, and most of these digital assets have drastically different use cases and profiles … Ultimately, you want to understand why you are holding any digital asset and how it fits into your overall portfolio,” said Kevin Feig, founder of Walk You to Wealth and previously head of risk at crypto exchanges Coinbase and Kraken. “More ETF options from multiple providers will likely lead to price competition and expense-ratio reductions, which is always a win for individual investors.” Sales of fixed income ETFs have been accelerating, and more companies are focusing on active management in new products. Sports betting and gambling have taken off in recent years, but their ETFs’ success remains relatively market-dependent. Rich investors with large stock portfolios and capital gains get a tax bonus with 351 ETF exchanges. The fund enters into swap agreements with J.P. Morgan and tracks an index from MerQube. People are also more informed than ever about their ETF investments, per a Nasdaq report. The buy now, pay later business has a stigma that could hold back a proposed ETF focused on the market, one observer noted. Assets under management in defined outcome ETFs are expected to top $650 billion by 2030, according to BlackRock data. The RIA’s investment manager recently launched a suite of nine products across a range of asset classes. Asset managers said active strategies are among their top choices for new products, per Morningstar. Most of the affected Vanguard index mutual funds and ETFs have co-managers, but several are now operating under single portfolio managers. A new ETF from several firms is banking on opportunities for active management amid a deregulatory White House agenda. The asset manager disclosed that it will close and liquidate the mutual funds and ETFs, including the BlackRock Impact Mortgage Fund. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: Former Irish Olympic swimming coach George Gibney to appear before Florida court next week

LAST UPDATE | 2 Jul FORMER IRISH OLYMPIC swimming coach George Gibney faces up to 79 charges, including attempted rape, relating to the alleged sexual abuse of four girls, according to court documents. 77-year-old Gibney will appear before a Florida court in the US next week after he was arrested by US Marshals on foot of an Irish extradition warrant yesterday. Gardaí have been investigating fresh allegations that Gibney sexually abused multiple children in his care while working as a swimming coach in Ireland decades ago. Documents detail that the former coach was wanted for 79 alleged sexual assault offences, 78 for indecent assault and one for attempted rape, against four girls between 1 January 1971 and 14 August 1974. A specialist unit within the Garda National Protective Services Bureau launched a detailed inquiry after a garda probe was reopened in 2020 when several people made allegations on a BBC and Second Captains podcast titled ‘Where is George Gibney?’. After a three-year investigation, a file was sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), who recommended charging Gibney. Court documents relating to the case, lodged last week, refer to the podcast series extensively. Taoiseach Micheál Martin, speaking in Japan this morning, said the arrest shows the importance of judicial cooperation with the United States. “I think we all listened to the podcast. I think it’s important that we have an agreement with the US. Gardaí have been working very diligently and in a detailed way, I have no doubt,” he said. Advertisement “We will await the next step now.” Gibney appeared before Orlando District Court Judge Daniel Irick for 11 minutes yesterday afternoon. He was remanded in the custody of US Marshals to appear before the same judge next Friday, 11 July, for a detention hearing. Gardaí said that they are aware of the arrest of a male aged in his 70s in the United States on the foot of an international warrant but would not be commenting “as this is currently a matter for the US authorities”. Gibney was the founder of the Trojan Swimming Club in Blackrock in Dublin, where he also worked as a coach. He was also the Irish national swimming coach until 1991. Now aged in his 70s, he was previously charged with 27 sexual offences in 1993, which were dropped in 1994 after Gibney secured a High Court injunction, preventing the DPP from prosecuting him. Gibney then left Ireland for Scotland, where he continued to work as a swimming coach. He has lived in the United States since 1995. In 1997, a Garda investigation into Gibney was opened after fresh allegations were made against him. The probe was then five years ago in the wake of the podcast series. The podcast centred on the survivors of sexual abuse by Gibney. A number of alleged victims emerged after an appeal was issued for people with any information to come forward. The DPP would be free to seek Gibney’s extradition from the US if it were to proceed with charges.

Title: Crypto Presales Live News Today: Latest Opportunities & Updates (July 2)

Time Published: 2025-07-02T07:27:30Z

Check out our Live Update Coverage on the Best Crypto Presales for July 2, 2025! Crypto presales are kicking gains day in and day out, motivated by impactful players like Mastercard, Visa, and the influx of new ETFs. These early-stage crypto projects are often significantly more profitable than established coins like Bitcoin. We’ll give you live updates on the trending presales, whale activities, projecting funding and development rounds, and critical alerts—everything you’ll need to get an edger. We update this page frequently throughout the day, as we get the latest insider insights on the hottest presales, so keep refreshing! July 2, 2025 • 12:25 UTC The 15-day streak of net inflows into US Bitcoin ETFs finally came to an end Tuesday, when $342M flowed out. Blackrock’s flagship $IBIT ETF also saw its 15-day streak finish, though the fund saw net-zero flows. Evidence points to a pause in ETF demand, rather than an outright reversal, particularly as Bitcoin has seen steady support in ‘diamond hand’ holders, per a report from Glassnode. Bitcoin ETFs still hold a cumulative $128B in assets under management. The momentum is still bullish for institutional crypto demand; Ethereum spot ETFs saw $40.7M inflows the same day. The demand bodes well for cutting-edge crypto presales like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), the first and fastest Bitcoin Layer-2 with SVM integration. Learn more about Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) at the official presale page. July 2, 2025 • 11:22 UTC Stablecoins keep making headlines. Now, a Layer-1 blockchain (called Stable) powered by Tether ($USDT) as a gas token plans to fix many of the issues plaguing the crypto industry now: Stable can take stablecoins to a faster, cheaper, and more accessible experience for users. The documentation mentions sub-second finality for transactions, USDT0 integration, and full EVM compatibility. The project will also offer exclusive features for institutional users, which goes hand in hand with the recent asset manager interest in stablecoins. If you want to take part in the future of stablecoins, then a non-custodial wallet like Best Wallet is your best bet. It not only offers self-custody with MPC security but a growing decentralized ecosystem through Best Wallet Token. Visit the official Best Wallet token website to learn more about the project. July 2, 2025 • 10:19 UTC According to data from Bitcoin Treasuries, public companies have now been buying more Bitcoin than ETFs for the third quarter in a row, with 131,000 $BTC purchases in Q2 2025, 18%, up from the previous quarter. Nick Marie, head of research at Ecoinometrics, justified the disparity as pure profit-hunting: ‘The institutional buyer who is getting exposure to Bitcoin through the ETFs are not buying for the same reason as those public companies who are basically trying to accumulate Bitcoin to increase shareholder value at the end of the day.’ This explains why public companies now hold 4% of the total Bitcoin supply, or 885,000 $BTC, with Strategy leading the pack with 597,325. The growing adoption rate is likely to fuel Bitcoin in 2025 and beyond, along with side projects like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), which show great long-term promise. As Bitcoin’s Layer-2 upgrade, Bitcoin Hyper promises to enhance Bitcoin’s infrastructure for faster transactions and lower costs. Learn more about Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) on the official presale page. July 2, 2025 • 09:19 UTC Unrealized profits among Bitcoiners reached over $1.2T, with Bitcoin’s total market cap at $2.14T. So more than half of that is HODLer profit, which is absolutely amazing to see. Glassnode’s ‘liveliness’ gauge is also going down, which again proves that holding is the dominant play among most Bitcoiners. What this means is that the market is more resilient than others would have you believe. Even through the Iran-Israel conflict, the bulls pushed $BTC back from under $100K to over $107K. And if there was ever a period to invest in up-and-coming cryptos (especially presales), it’s now. With so many ETFs coming, giants like JPMorgan jumping into the game, and Bitcoin reserves popping, it’s the best time to make some money. Projects like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), which introduces the first-ever Bitcoin Layer-2 integrated with Solana’s Virtual Machine. This adds smart contract and dApp support to Bitcoin, aside from lower fees, higher-speed transactions, and a 2025 makeover that Bitcoin sorely needs. Check out Bitcoin Hyper’s presale page for more information on the project. July 2, 2025 • 08:22 UTC Fresh data for June reveals a significant boost for the crypto and Web3 sectors. Startups raised an impressive $1.15B across 140 deals, marking a 9% increase in deal count from May. The surge demonstrates growing investor confidence and a positive environment for decentralized technologies. Major players like Kalshi and cryptography firm Zama FHE secured significant investment rounds ($185M & $57M respectively), highlighting a focus on foundational innovation. Amidst this bullish trend, investors will start looking for strategic opportunities. One such project is the BTCBULL token ($BTCBULL), designed to directly benefit from $BTC’s ascent. With unique features like real Bitcoin airdrops for holders as $BTC hits key milestones, $BTCBULL offers a unique way to take part in the market’s upward trajectory. The $BTC is dropped into your Best Wallet (one of the leading non-custodial crypto wallets) when the targets are met. We’re seeing the crypto landscape mature rapidly, opening new avenues for savvy investors. Learn more about BTCBULL Token ($BTCBULL) on its presale page. July 2, 2025 • 07:26 UTC BlackRock’s $3.85B Bitcoin buying spree in June reflects renewed institutional appetite for crypto, which can only be good news for some of the best new presales. BlackRock’s Bitcoin accumulation strategy, which is expected to continue in July, indicates that traditional finance and crypto are coming together faster than expected. The trend is clear: traditional finance firms increasingly treat Bitcoin as a treasury asset. Heavyweights like Strategy, Tesla, Block, Coinbase, and financial giants such as BlackRock and JPMorgan are all stacking, marking increasing institutional acceptance of BTC. When huge organizations invest billions of dollars into Bitcoin, it can inspire confidence and trigger bullish trends ahead. New investors are looking to jump on the next big thing to blow in a bull run. Top crypto presales, like the degenerate new meme token TOKEN6900 and Snorter Token with its Solana trading bot, could offer just that. Find out more about the best new presales to buy in a Bitcoin bull run. July 2, 2025 • 07:25 UTC Bitget has just released their first zero-fee crypto card in partnership with Mastercard and Immersve. This announcement comes just two weeks after Mastercard partnered with Chainlink to enable on-chain crypto purchases, which would open roughly 3.5B cards to the blockchain. Scott Abrams, Executive Vice President, Global Partnerships at Mastercard, welcomes the partnership by stating: ‘At Mastercard, we’re committed to working with innovative companies like Bitget Wallet and Immersve to make crypto transactions simple, secure, and accessible at scale.’ Bitget currently reaches over 80 million users globally and supports over 130 blockchains, 20k distributed apps, and 1M tokens. The news is likely to not only bump Bitget’s stocks, but also support more user-friendly non-custodial wallets like Best Wallet, currently with its trademark $BEST token in presale.

Dear friends, Welcome to the “Midsommar in Scandinavia” issue of the Mutual Fund Observer. Chip and I are enjoying a long-planned holiday in Sweden and Norway. We’re equally delighted that you’re here … and we’re there! Among other things (how would I know for sure? I’m in Gamla Stan), Lynn Bolin addresses the emerging threat of tariff-induced inflation with “Protecting Against Tariff Induced Inflation,” analyzing how widespread tariffs will likely be passed through to consumers and drive inflation to an estimated 3.4% peak next quarter. Drawing on five years of post-pandemic bond performance data, he demonstrates that shorter-duration and inflation-protected securities have significantly outperformed traditional intermediate-term bonds, leading him to rotate into funds like Vanguard Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities Index (VTAPX), Fidelity Inflation-Protected Bond Index Fund (FIPDX), and PIMCO Inflation Response Multi-Asset Fund (PZRMX). Bolin has reduced his stock allocation from 65% to 50% and now maintains approximately 7% of his bond allocation in inflation-protected securities, with another 40% in shorter-duration bonds, while also incorporating target-maturity TIPS ETFs like iShares iBonds Oct 2030 Term Tips ETF (IBIG) into his bond ladders. America’s premier Asian investment boutique, Matthews Asia, has fallen on hard times. Former CEO and portfolio manager Mark Headley has returned from retirement, intent on fixing that. Our hour-long interview is summarized in “Good Bones There.” Without any doubt, the most successful small-cap value fund in existence is Scott Barbee’s Aegis Value Fund. We last shared a full profile of the fund in 2013, but it has appeared in eight data-driven articles since then. We decided it was high time to catch up with Mr. Barbee and correct our oversight in a profile of Aegis Value Fund (AVALX). Three years ago, in the midst of a market meltdown (do you even recall the ’22 crash now), we offered advice on how to cope with a … ummm “spanked portfolio.” The whimsical accompanying graphic generated a surprising amount of site traffic. This month, we offer a three-year retrospective on our 2022 advice: keep calm and consider small-value funds with high-quality portfolios. The performance numbers seem promising. We also share a Launch Alert for Stewart Investors Worldwide Leaders Fund, the US launch of a successful non-US strategy focusing on a concentrated portfolio of high-quality, sustainable businesses. The launch was seeded by a US foundation, so the initial share class is institution with retail in the pipeline! Hedge funds are shifting to Asia. Goldman Sachs reports that hedge fund trading in Asian markets have a five-year high in June. “Hedge funds bought equities in Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan and India last week, but were short selling onshore Chinese stocks,” Goldman said. Family offices are shifting to infrastructure and private debt. A BlackRock survey of 175 family offices, the investment manager for ultra-wealthy families, reports that one-third were planning to increase exposure to private debt this year and 30% were planning to commit more resources to infrastructure investments. Almost every smart beta (e.g., low volatility or fundamental valuation) strategy has failed to produce, according to new research from Research Affiliates (free registration required). The short version: RA has been tracking the performance of a series of factor-based portfolios since 2018, looking to see whether any provided the promised excess return. They did not. In every case, just investing in “the market” was a better bet. The good news: “the market” – defined by its large / growth / momentum subset, is now so egregiously overpriced that almost everything outside of that niche is dramatically underpriced. Source: Research Affiliates, 06/2025 The way to read that chart is to start by finding the little green diamonds. Those are the more-or-less current valuations of each strategy relative to its historic valuations. Green diamonds below the colored bar, which illustrates the historic range from 10th percentile to 90th, signals that the strategy is now cheaper than it has been 90% or 95% of the time. RA concludes that’s good news since valuation matters: … we believe there may be hope for all smart beta strategies. If markets receive a wake-up call and valuations revert, a multitude of systematic factor-based equity strategies could all have a field day. After eight years of going horribly wrong, smart beta investing may now go horribly right. AI is a lot dumber than we thought. A series of research reports, most recently from Apple, argue that while AI can execute certain tasks exceptionally well, reasoning is not among them. The researchers found that in simple reasoning tasks, including the Towers of Hanoi challenge, AIs underperform 7-year-olds. Their central argument is that even the most advanced LLMs do not think in any way that resembles us. Their conclusion is that AI “thinking” is not just different, it’s horrible. (Gary Marcus, “A Knockout Blow for LLMs? LLM ‘reasoning’ is so cooked, they turned my name into a verb,” Communications of the ACM, 6/16/2025). Source: Amazon.com As the complexity of demands rises, moving AI beyond its comfort zone, so does the frequency of hallucinations. One estimate is that 79% of responses from some of the newer AI contain hallucinated content (“A.I. Is Getting More Powerful, but Its Hallucinations Are Getting Worse,” New York Times, 5/6/2025, subscription required). A coda to that argument: ChatGPT just lost a chess match to an Atari 2600. If you’re, oh, under 50, you can be forgiven for the question “WTF is an Atari?” because the 2600 is a home video game console released in 1977. ChatGPT actually volunteered to play the old game system. Oops. One report of the match contained this summary: In fact, the Atari wiped the floor with ChatGPT when it came to chess. I don’t mean the near-half-century-old game console won. I mean that ChatGPT made blunders that would embarrass the greenest of beginners. On the upside, perhaps it thinks it won? “So I said ‘here, hold ma beer an’ gimme a knight an’ I kicked its little Atari keester all the way to …’”. AI is dirtier than we thought. Not “smutty dirt” (though that’s nice, too) but “energy- and water-gulping dirty.” MIT researchers found two troubling trends: AI data centers use more power and more power derived from fossil fuels than “normal” data centers: … more than half of the electricity going to data centers will be used for AI. At that point, AI alone could consume as much electricity annually as 22% of all US households. Meanwhile, data centers are expected to continue trending toward using dirtier, more carbon-intensive forms of energy (like gas) to fill immediate needs, leaving clouds of emissions in their wake. (“We did the math on AI’s energy footprint. Here’s the story you haven’t heard,” MIT Technology Review, 6/2025) Part of the challenge is that AI companies seem desperately concerned with obscuring the magnitude of their energy and water use, which some suspect sounds like a guilty conscience at work. AI users are stupider than we thought. Folks have casually and constantly observed the tendency of people to be lazy, turning to AI to do their work and thoughtlessly passing it along as their own. The underlying phenomenon is called “cognitive offloading.” It’s driven by two biological imperatives: humans have a limited supply of energy each day and thinking requires a lot of energy. Our survival response is to think as little as necessary to get through the day. The polite term for us is “cognitive misers.” We rely on tricks, shortcuts, and habits – none of which require much energy – to muddle through. But we also offload tasks – we delegate – whenever possible. As a quick test, how many telephone numbers can you recite off the top of your head? (No, 9-1-1 doesn’t count.) When I was young, the answer was probably “dozens.” Today, it’s probably two or three (my own, Chip’s, and my son’s). I count on my phone to keep track of the rest. That’s cognitive offloading. A second set of MIT researchers, the Brain on Large Language Models team, has been doing fairly rigorous research on how our brains respond to the availability of AI/LLMs as an offloading option. (Spoiler alert: not well.) Most recently, they gave three groups of students the same task. One group had access to ChatGPT, one had access to Google, and the other had to think for themselves. (Yikes.) The study ran over four months and included both brain activity monitors and direct observation. Their findings: Brain connectivity systematically scaled down with the amount of external support: the Brain‑only group exhibited the strongest, widest‑ranging networks, Search Engine group showed intermediate engagement, and LLM assistance elicited the weakest overall coupling … The reported ownership of LLM group’s essays in the interviews was low. The Search Engine group had strong ownership, but lesser than the Brain-only group. The LLM group also fell behind in their ability to quote from the essays they wrote just minutes prior. (Your Brain on ChatGPT, 6/2025) The short version: the brains of Chat-dependent students literally powered down and while the students nominally completed the work themselves, they had little belief in their own written conclusions and couldn’t quite remember what they’d just said. Rather as we can’t quite remember our sibling’s phone number five minutes after we called them. The White House apparently has an opening for a new Best Billionaire Friend (BBF) after a spectacular fallout between Mr. Trump and the previous holder of the position, Mr. Musk. Mr. Musk, who invested heavily in Mr. Trump’s election campaign, left government service, such as it was, denounced Mr. Trump’s signature legislative package as “a disgusting abomination” and endorsed a call for Mr. Trump’s impeachment. He nonetheless affirmed his “love for the guy.” Two of Mr. Musk’s associates attribute the fallout to Mr. Trump’s failure to give Musk and Tesla favorable treatment under the bill. “Elon was butthurt,” according to one source. Musk threatened to decommission his fleet of Dragon spacecraft. Trump threatened to “terminate Elon’s Government Subsidies and Contracts” and to investigate his business practices. Musk caved. We’ve written a fair amount about the history and enduring psychology of these alliances (“If you’re so rich, why aren’t you smart?” LinkedIn, 4/2025). Two things to remember: Fortunately, the BBF position is likely to be swiftly filled. UBS reports (6/2025) that there are now 31 people with wealth in excess of $50 billion dollars. Queue forms to the right! To all of the folks helping to make our Scandinavian sojourn amazing! We asked, you answered! Thanks so much to all the folks who shared good wishes and travel advice for our upcoming Scandinavian adventure: Stuart, Leah, Marjorie, DGH, and Roger. Thank you, thank you! Stuart: the Vasa Museum is one of our must-see sites! Gotland and Stumholmen are saved for our next trip. Leah: thanks for the sweater advice – we’re setting aside a budget for Bergen. And Chip might be booking a table at Bryggen Tracteursted as I write. DGH: Pending good weather, the Norse Folkemuseum and time to wander around Bygdøy are on the itinerary. Also, do we like cinnamon rolls? “Like” is such an understatement. WB Samson, got it! Roger: We are doing the Norway in a Nutshell with an overnight in Flåm. Since you and Leah both made note of the hiking/walking opportunities, we’ll see what we can fit in. We also have Frogner Park on the list!

The IPO was subscribed 16.69 times, powered by institutional interest signalling renewed investor appetite for large public offerings. Following a successful IPO, the company has fixed the issue price at ₹740. Qualified institutional buyers (QIBs) drove demand, with the reserved portion getting subscribed 55.47 times, while the non-institutional investor segment showed moderate interest with 9.99 times subscription. The quota reserved for retail investors was subscribed 1.41 times, with most opting for cut-off price bids. The employee category witnessed 5.71 times subscription, while existing shareholders (HDFC Bank) subscribed 4.26 times over their reserved quota. The overall issue size is ₹12,500 crore — compriseing fresh issue worth ₹2,500 crore and an offer-for-sale of up to ₹10,000 crore by HDFC Bank. The IPO is the largest in 2025 so far. Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities Ltd, said after years of anticipation, HDB Financial Services is finally set to debut on the Indian stock exchanges, and early indicators point to a healthy 8–10 per cent listing gain, reflecting strong investor appetite. “The IPO garnered over ₹1.61 lakh crore in bids, underscoring massive institutional and retail interest. This makes HDB’s offering the second most subscribed IPO among ₹10,000+ crore issues, trailing only the record-breaking Tata Technologies listing. However, it did fall short of surpassing the all-time high ₹3 lakh crore+ subscription seen in the Bajaj Housing Finance IPO,” he added. “We believe the robust response signals market confidence in HDB’s business model, parentage (as an HDFC group company), and long-term growth potential in the NBFC space. If the listing meets expectations, it would reaffirm investor appetite for high-quality financial services plays, especially those backed by trusted legacy institutions,” he further said. In a recent interaction with businessline, G Ramesh, MD and CEO of HDB Financial Services, said the IPO proceeds would be used for on-lending, growth and strengthening the NBFC’s capital base. He clarified that HDB operates independent of HDFC Bank, not sharing business leads, office space or operational support. The company proposes using the fresh issue’s net proceeds to augment its Tier—I Capital base to meet its future capital requirements, including onward lending under any of its business verticals, i.e., Enterprise Lending, Asset Finance, and Consumer Finance. Further, a portion of the proceeds from the Fresh Issue will be used to meet Offer Expenses His remarks came amid the RBI’s 2024 draft norms proposing that only a single entity in a bank group can engage in a specific line of business. HDFC Bank’s stake in HDB will reduce to 75 per cent from 94 per cent post the IPO, the MD said. Ahead of the issue opening, HDB Financial Services had rasied ₹3,368.99 crore from anchor investors. Some of the marquee investors include the Life Insurance Corporation of India, ICICI Prudential MF, Nippon Life India MF, BlackRock, Axis MF, Aditya Birla Sun Life MF, UTI MF, Schroder International Selection Fund, and Goldman Sachs Funds, among others. JM Financial Limited, BNP Paribas, BofA Securities India Limited, Goldman Sachs (India) Securities Private Limited, HSBC Securities and Capital Markets (India) Private Limited, IIFL Capital Services Limited (Formerly known as IIFL Securities Limited), Jefferies India Private Limited, Morgan Stanley India Company Private Limited, Motilal Oswal Investment Advisors Limited, Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Private Limited, Nuvama Wealth Management Limited, UBS Securities India Private Limited are the Book Running Lead Managers to the offer. Mehta said: “Given the strong subscription momentum and prevailing bullish sentiment in the market, we recommend holding the stock for the long term, as HDB Financial Services is strategically positioned to benefit from India’s structural credit growth, especially within the retail and SME financing segments.” Published on July 2, 2025 Copyright© 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Title: CBS Documentary Decrying Oligarchs Omits Notorious Lefty Billionaires

All Rights Reserved. Text to Speech A CBS News documentary blasted America’s supposed transition to a so-called “Gilded Age” of oligarchs to attack President Trump and the tech leaders who stood with him at his inauguration. As if CBS stood for Channeling Bernie Sanders. The problem: The documentary conveniently excluded any mention about the most notorious left-wing billionaires in U.S. politics that have used their cash to either try to buy elections or drastically overhaul U.S. policy over the years. Coincidence? We think not. The CBS documentary released June 28, “Is America in a New Gilded Age? Wealth, Power and Democracy,” relied mostly on whiny anti-capitalist commentary from radical talking heads like millionaires Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and former Clinton stooge Robert Reich to slam American capitalism as the culprit for Trump’s return to the White House, and by extension X owner Elon Musk’s tenure as the overseer of DOGE. “[A]fter the last presidential election, tensions over wealth, power and democracy have only heightened,” sensationalized CBS senior business and technology correspondent Jo Ling Kent. She admitted during a CBS Mornings appearance the day prior to her documentary’s release that her work was inspired by millionaire President Joe Biden’s farewell address warning about a rising “oligarchy.” See where this is going? Kent propped up Sanders and like-minded leftist legislators like fellow socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) who “began the Fighting Oligarchy tour, holding rallies around the country to push back against what he argues is a corrupting influence of billionaires on U.S. politics.” But for all Kent and others’ grumbling over figures like Musk, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Kent completely bypassed the ungodly political influence of other lefty billionaire titans who have built empires on the amount of political power they’ve gained during their lengthy careers. WATCH: CBS News Reporter Jo Ling Kent Hawks Her Anti-Billionaire Documentary on CBS Mornings (June 27, 2025). These include George Soros (and now his son Alex by extension) who has spewed $32 billion into his Open Society Foundations to foment racial strife, buoy climate change fanaticism, stoke LGBTQ political furor, push for open borders and undercut American sovereignty on the world stage. In addition, Soros spent hundreds of millions collectively on electing extremist political candidates and soft-on-crime prosecutors in order to shape politics to be the mirror reflection of his unhinged, anti-American worldview. His son Alex, who now controls his father's empire, openly promotes his enormous political pull with America's and the world's most powerful leaders on social media, including Biden. (Left to right: Michael Bloomberg, George Soros, Reid Hoffman) Other high-profile billionaires missing from the documentary included Michael Bloomberg, who spent over $1 billion trying to buy the 2020 election, pledged another $1 billion at least to wipe out the U.S. coal industry, and spent $47 million during the 2024 election alone to elect Vice President Kamala Harris and help Democrats maintain control over the House; and deranged LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman who spent millions to elect Harris in 2024 and who personally bankrolled the highly politicized sexual abuse lawsuit against Trump brought by leftist E. Jean Carroll. Reid Hoffman was specifically part of a cohort of left-wing billionaires like former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, philanthropist Laurene Powell-Jobs and Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz who spent fortunes on secretive political machines to help Biden get elected in 2020. These weren’t mentioned by Kent either, which is even more telling given she also cited leftist anti-Trump author Andrea Bernstein who chirped, “What are you going to do if you’re wealthy and you have a lot of money? You’re going to put some of that into the political system to try to influence outcomes so that you can hang on to even more money. That’s the way the system works.” Ironic. To Kent’s credit, she did interview four guests who rebuffed the idea that America was reentering a Gilded Age (including Wall Street Journal columnist Jason Riley and Competitive Enterprise Institute President Kent Lassman), but these were largely dwarfed by another eight commentators who were just attacking and smearing the billionaires who have coalesced around Trump. For example, Kent tee’d up Dartmouth Sociology Professor Brooke Harrington, whose antagonistic term “broligarchs” she defined as rich people who “decide that they get to keep all the money and that they’re not going to pay any of their fair share of the costs of the society that made them prosperous.” Harrington then used this term to go after Musk and his businesses, but not other powerful billionaires who share her anti-capitalist views, such as Soros. Hypocritically, Kent didn’t bother to mention the enormous ESG asset manager giants that represent three of the top four institutional shareholders of her parent company Paramount Global and her liberal competitor networks at NBC, ABC, and CNN: BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, which manage over $26 trillion in assets. Sounds pretty oligarchy-adjacent, but apparently not for Kent. She had the audacity to cherry-pick Bezos’s purchase of The Washington Post and Musk’s $44 billion acquisition of social media giant Twitter as examples of the inherent problems in business tycoons owning media. “One of the real dangers of great concentrated wealth is that not only does it exert influence politically, but it also exerts influence through its ownership of the media,” Reich complained to Kent. The CBS journalist followed up by referring back to how “in the Gilded Age, the ultra-wealthy could buy almost anything. And one prize for many was the means to influence public opinion.” Pretty sure the C-suites at BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street were just tickled pink over that, eh Jo? “Owning a media company has always been viewed as an accessory for the very powerful,” pontificated Bloomberg Businessweek editor Brad Stone, who along with Kent apparently forgot that eco-activist Michael Bloomberg, worth $104 billion, owns his magazine. But Kent sure let him get in some digs at Bezos for daring to exercise his authority as The Post owner to shift the Opinion Page to a more free market position and ban the editorial board’s objectivity-wrecking tradition of endorsing political candidates. Riley, in one of his brief appearances in the documentary, slammed the hypocrisy of the left in fixating on billionaires when they seem to be oblivious to the special interests financing their own side. “Are people on the left complaining that other wealthy individuals decide to spend their money on electing people who want to go soft on criminals that are raising hell in low income communities?” He continued: “If you’re spending your money a certain way, you’re okay. If you’re spending it on free market ideas and principles — if you want lower taxes, if you want smaller government and so forth — somehow you are villainous.” Kent conceded that 80 billionaires donated to Harris’s campaign in 2024, while just over 50 billionaires did the same for Trump. But her documentary was clear in its implication that the only titans that matter to her and the CBS media giant are the ones that curry favor with Trump, while ignoring other, more dangerous political players on the left, including her own shareholder bosses.

Title: US dollar suffers worst start to a year since 1973 over Trump tariff concerns

The US dollar suffered its worst first-half decline in more than 50 years as fears over President Trump’s tariff policies have driven down the world’s principal reserve currency. The greenback weakened 10.7% in the first six months of the year compared to a basket of currencies from major trading partners – the worst drop since 1973 when President Nixon stopped tying the dollar to the price of gold. But its decline could be part of Trump’s broader vision to devalue the dollar — an idea reportedly floated by Stephen Miran, recently appointed Chairman of the US Council of Economic Advisers in what has been dubbed the Mar-a-Lago Accord. Miran has denied this conspiracy in the past. A weaker dollar makes US exports much cheaper, and could aid Trump’s oft-stated goal of boosting manufacturing at home, as well as reducing the nation’s trade deficit, the thinking goes. When he was campaigning for a second term, an official in the first Trump administration told Politico that “currency revaluation is likely to be a priority” because of “the viewpoint that [an overvalued dollar] contributes to the trade deficit.” Trump has not weighed in on the speculation about devaluing the dollar. “President Trump has repeatedly affirmed his commitment to the dominance of the dollar as the world’s reserve currency,” White House press spokesman Kush Desai told The Post on Tuesday. “Ten-year Treasury yields rallying down nearly 40 basis points since Inauguration Day, four consecutive expectation-beating inflation reports, and the trillions in historic investment commitments that have poured into the United States since Election Day are all indicative of the confidence that investors and markets continue to have in our economy and currency.” But many experts claim Trump’s hefty tariffs are putting pressure on the dollar and forcing global investors to rethink their ties to the currency. “Trump is definitely playing with fire,“ Stephen Miller, a consultant for GSFM, a unit of Canada’s CI Financial Corp. in Australia, told Bloomberg. While a weaker dollar should theoretically help US exporters, there’s still a lot of uncertainty when it comes to global trade because of the Trump administration’s ongoing negotiations with key nations, which are staring down a fast-approaching July 9 deadline. The dollar’s fall comes after it soared on Trump’s re-election win and peaked in mid-January on hopes he would bring a pro-growth mindset to the White House. But in April, Trump’s “Liberation Day” announcement revealed tariffs that were much stiffer than analysts and economists had predicted, spurring a broad shift away from US investments. “Full-scale de-dollarization, if it ever comes, is still a long way away,” Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock, said in the company’s most recent forecast. But the drop in confidence in the US dollar, which is typically seen as a safe haven asset, is concerning – and could worsen with a rise in government debt, according to Rieder. Trump’s massive budget bill, which is projected to add $3 trillion in national debt, narrowly squeaked through the Senate on Tuesday. It awaits final approval in the House. The concerns over higher inflation and debt have have pushed long-term Treasury yields lower. The 10-year yield started near 5% this year and has steadily fallen, reaching 4.267% on Tuesday. “I think we’re going to continue to have this higher pressure on the low end of the yield curve because we haven’t really dealt anything away with the deficit or inflation for that matter. In fact, there’s more risk now than anything,” Ben Emons, founder of FedWatch Advisors, said on CNBC’s “Fast Money” Tuesday. “I do think it’s related to Treasuries, that if Treasuries get more under pressure, the dollar will get weaker.” Advertisement

Title: Live From ETHCC Robinhood Launches Tokenized OpenAI Access

BySandy Carter BySandy Carter, Contributor. Robinhood is making significant headlines live from ETHcc in France (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty ... More Images) At the Ethereum Community Conference (ETHCC) in Cannes this week, I’ve been keynoting, speaking on panels, networking, and diving deep into topics like decentralized AI and next-gen blockchains. One announcement that truly stood out was Robinhood’s bold leap forward. They’re evolving from a retail brokerage into a next-gen financial super app—with blockchain at the core. Tokenized Nvidia shares? That’s the kind of real-world utility that actually moves the needle. From tokenizing over 200 U.S. stocks and ETFs to building its own Layer 2 blockchain, Robinhood is positioning itself at the convergence of traditional finance and decentralized finance. The implications could be transformative, not only for the company but for the future of digital assets globally. Vlad Tenev, Robinhood’s CEO, unveiled the launch of tokenized stocks for private companies – like SpaceX —offered exclusively to eligible customers in the European Union. These digital assets are initially issued on Arbitrum, a layer-2 Ethereum scaling solution known for speed and low fees. Over time, Robinhood plans to migrate its offerings to a proprietary blockchain, currently in development. Vlad Tenev, the CEO of Robinhood, announcing the launch of tokenized stocks for private companies ... More like SpaceX and OpenAI, available to European Union customers. This announcement wasn’t just a headline moment—it marked the beginning of a broader integration between traditional finance and decentralized finance (DeFi). Robinhood’s move into tokenization is designed to provide 24/5 access to over 200 U.S. stocks and ETFs with no commissions, no added spreads, dividend support, and crypto wallet compatibility. In addition, Robinhood shared that tokenized shares of select privately held companies—most notably OpenAI (see below for updates) and SpaceX—will be made available to eligible EU customers later this summer, expanding access to high-profile, previously inaccessible private equity. The timing is no accident. Robinhood recently secured new licenses in Europe, and unveiling this initiative at ETHCC underscores its ambitions to expand globally and deepen its footprint in the blockchain space. The regulatory contrast between regions is sharp. While U.S. customers are now gaining access to crypto staking (starting with Ethereum and Solana), European users are unlocking access to tokenized public and private equities. It’s a bold move that positions the EU as the first major market to experience tokenized real-world assets at scale, through a consumer-facing platform. The news triggered a powerful market response: Robinhood’s shares surged to a fresh all‑time high, climbing 11–13% on the day, reflecting investor confidence in this strategic pivot and the market’s enthusiasm for bringing high-value assets onchain. Robinhood’s rollout of tokenized shares in Europe took a dramatic turn when OpenAI publicly disavowed any involvement. While Robinhood discussed their ability to offer users fractional exposure to companies like OpenAI and SpaceX through blockchain-wrapped assets, OpenAI made it clear: no partnership, no equity transfer, no endorsement. It’s the financial equivalent of putting a company’s logo on a t-shirt and selling it—without ever talking to the brand. This clash underscores a growing tension: platforms are racing to tokenize access, while companies are scrambling to retain control of their cap tables. Robinhood argues this is about unlocking opportunity through indirect exposure via special purpose vehicles. But OpenAI’s reaction is a reminder that not all “access” is created equal—especially when real ownership isn’t part of the equation. This move mirrors a similar announcement from Republic earlier in the week, yet the mechanics differ substantially. Republic issues equity‑backed Digital Asset Receipts (DARTs), representing true on‑chain ownership of shares held in trusts or SPVs. This approach is pure “on-chain equity”—combining legal rights with digital portability. The difference in tokenization of stocks between Robinhood and Republic By contrast, Robinhood’s offering appears to be more like synthetic exposure or broker‑held tokens. They grant economic participation—such as dividend gains and tradability—without conferring legal shareholder status. In short, Republic’s approach is “on‑chain equity,” while Robinhood’s may be closer to “on‑chain access.” Different infrastructural models, same goal: unlocking elite investment opportunities via blockchain. Tokenized equities are just the beginning. Robinhood has layered in multiple crypto and blockchain features across its platforms. Following its completion of the Bitstamp acquisition, EU users will soon gain access to perpetual futures with up to 3x leverage—a tool typically favored by advanced traders. These derivatives are slated to launch later this summer. In the US, Robinhood has introduced crypto staking for Ethereum and Solana, aligning with regulatory guidance clarifying staking doesn't qualify as a security. Eligible users in approved states can now earn yield directly within Robinhood’s platform. Additional user incentives include a 1–2% bonus on transferred crypto deposits, upcoming cashback-to-crypto conversion via the Robinhood Gold credit card, and advanced tax‑lot selection tools—giving retail traders greater control over capital gains and reporting. Robinhood is achieving what few other platforms can: operationalizing tokenized equity for the masses within a regulated, mobile‑first environment. Major financial players like BlackRock and Goldman Sachs explore similar blockchain models behind the scenes, but Robinhood is delivering real‑world asset tokenization directly to mainstream retail users. Industry estimates suggest tokenized assets could reach $13.55 trillion by 2030. With licenses secured and a product roadmap underway, Robinhood is racing against competitors like Coinbase, Kraken, and Republic to define how riders experience tokenized finance. Bankless co‑founder David Hoffman commented that Robinhood—armed with regulatory approval and pre‑IPO access—is well‑positioned to leapfrog crypto‑native platforms in this race. Robinhood’s long-term vision extends well beyond tokenized stocks. The company is stacking in features like an AI‑driven investing assistant (Cortex), smart order routing across liquidity pools, advanced mobile charting, and eventually a full-fledged Ethereum-compatible Layer‑2 optimized for real‑world asset tokenization. This next-gen blockchain infrastructure is designed for 24/7 trading, cross-chain asset bridging, and self‑custody—redefining retail access in the age of TradFi meets DeFi. Robinhood’s ETHCC 2025 announcements mark a pivotal moment in digital finance, not just product innovation. By bringing tokenized private equity like SpaceX into its mobile app, layering in staking and perpetual futures, and building blockchain infrastructure, Robinhood is staking a claim as a frontrunner in the financial super app space. As tokenized investing becomes a tangible reality for millions, the lines between centralized brokerages and decentralized protocols are blurring—setting a high bar for the next generation of financial platforms.

FORMER IRISH OLYMPIC swimming coach George Gibney has been arrested by US authorities in Florida this afternoon. He was taken into custody by US Marshals on foot of an Irish extradition warrant and is being detained pending a court appearance. Gardaí have been investigating fresh allegations that Gibney sexually abused multiple children in his care while working as a swimming coach in Ireland decades ago. The investigation was reopened in 2020 after several individuals made allegations on a BBC and Second Captains podcast titled ‘Where is George Gibney?’, prompting a specialist unit within the Garda National Protective Services Bureau to begin a detailed inquiry. After a three-year investigation, a file was sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), who recommended charging Gibney. In a statement today, gardaí said that they are”aware of the arrest of a male aged in his 70s in the United States” on the foot of an Irish international arrest warrant. “As this is currently a matter for the US authorities, An Garda Síochána will not be commenting further at this time,” a spokesperson said. Advertisement Gibney was the founder of the Trojan Swimming Club in Blackrock in Dublin, where he also worked as a coach. He was also the Irish national swimming coach until 1991. Now aged in his 70s, he was previously charged with 27 sexual offences in 1993. However, the charges of indecent assault and unlawful carnal knowledge were dropped in 1994 after he secured an injunction in the High Court preventing the DPP from prosecuting him. Gibney left Ireland and moved to Scotland where he continued to work as a swimming coach. He has lived in the United States since 1995. In 1997, a garda investigation into Gibney was opened after fresh allegations were made against him. This investigation did not result in a prosecution. In 2020, the ‘Where is George Gibney?’ podcast, a ten-part investigative series produced by BBC Sounds and Second Captains, gave an in-depth at look the circumstances and child abuse accusations surrounding Gibney. The series centred on the survivors of sexual abuse by Gibney, and it became one of the most impactful pieces of journalism of recent years – many new survivors came forward to tell their story, and gardaí commenced a new investigation after the podcast was broadcast. An appeal was issued for people with any information to come forward. A number of alleged victims did come forward with allegations. The DPP would be free to seek Gibney’s extradition from the US if it was to proceed with charges. Readers like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...

Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. European banking behemoth UniCredit is entering the crypto arena with a structured product tied to BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), Bloomberg News reported on July 1, citing an internal memo. Under the plan, UniCredit will offer professional clients a five-year, U.S. dollar-denominated investment certificate linked to BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). The product will guarantee 100% capital protection at maturity. BlackRock launched its spot Bitcoin exchange-traded product in Europe in March, listing under the ticker “IB1T” on Euronext Paris and Xetra, and “BTCN” on Euronext Amsterdam. The firm’s U.S.-listed IBIT fund has amassed over $73 billion in assets under management, making it the most successful crypto-linked financial product by investment capital to date. The move comes amid a sweeping embrace of digital assets by European banks, enabled by the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulatory regime becoming effective across the bloc. Deutsche Bank last week confirmed it will launch institutional crypto custody services in 2026. It follows a June announcement that the lender is also exploring stablecoin issuance and blockchain payment projects in step with MiCA guidelines. Simultaneously, Germany’s Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe, comprising local savings banks with over 50 million customers, is preparing to roll out regulated crypto trading access for its retail clients by summer 2026, offering assets such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). Meanwhile, Deutsche Boerse’s custody arm, Clearstream, began providing institutional clients with Bitcoin and Ethereum settlement and custody services earlier this year. France’s Societe Generale is also continuing its expansion into digital finance and launching a dollar-pegged stablecoin, USD CoinVertible, via its SG-FORGE subsidiary this month.dy. Spain’s BBVA, commonly cautious on crypto, now advises affluent clients to hold 3%–7% of their portfolios in Bitcoin and Ethereum. The lender has also secured approval to launch crypto trading services. However, European regulators remain cautious. ECB Governor Fabio Panetta recently reiterated concerns of reputational risks from crypto services inside regulated banks and stressed the need to manage investor expectations and consider a digital euro to preserve confidence in financial systems.
