Business Insider is on the ground at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, this week, and we want to take you along with us. We'll be updating our liveblog throughout the week with breaking news, insights from interviews and conversations, power-player sightings, and color from private events. From global growth to AI, talent, and the future of work, Davos is where the year's biggest ideas are debated, deals are struck, and the road map for the year ahead gets sketched out. Follow along here for real-time updates from Davos. We're wrapping up our live coverage of the second day of Davos 2026. Today, we sampled $13 hot chocolates from Meta, witnessed an awkward moment between top tech leaders, heard about attendees getting scammed by "fake VIP passes" for the USA House, and, of course, documented some of the best fashion of the day. We'll be back on Wednesday, focusing on President Donald Trump's appearance and the ongoing fallout from his threats against Greenland. At a White House press briefing on Tuesday, President Donald Trump remained coy on the issue of Greenland, though he signaled it would be a topic of discussion at Davos. "We have a lot of meetings scheduled on Greenland. I'm leaving tonight, as you know. Davos," Trump told reporters during the nearly two-hour-long briefing. "I think things are going to work out pretty well."

"We have a lot of meetings scheduled on Greenland. I'm leaving tonight, as you know. Davos," Trump told reporters during the nearly two-hour-long briefing. "I think things are going to work out pretty well." Trump was also asked how far he was willing to go to acquire the territory, which is owned by Denmark. "You'll find out," Trump replied. Anthropic and Google DeepMind chiefs say they're seeing early signs of AI affecting junior-level hiring. Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind, predicted this would be the year when AI could mean cutting back on entry-level jobs and internships. "I think there is some evidence, I can feel that ourselves," he said during a joint interview with Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei at Davos on Tuesday.

"I think there is some evidence, I can feel that ourselves," he said during a joint interview with Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei at Davos on Tuesday. Amodei agreed. "Now I think maybe we're starting to see just the little beginnings of it, in software and coding," he said, adding that Anthropic is thinking about how to deal with this change "in a sensible way." Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina said on Tuesday that he understands why Trump wants Greenland. "I support the what: being able to project power in the Arctic," Tillis said at the "Path to Peace in Ukraine: By Might or by Accord?" panel. "Oh my goodness, anyone in NATO should understand that as a priority." Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina said on Tuesday that he understands why Trump wants Greenland. "I support the what: being able to project power in the Arctic," Tillis said at the "Path to Peace in Ukraine: By Might or by Accord?" panel. "Oh my goodness, anyone in NATO should understand that as a priority." Russia and China's military drills in the Arctic show that "clearly we have to have a power projection platform and Greenland makes a lot of geographic sense," he said. But he said he doesn't agree with Trump's how. Greenland is a territory of Denmark, a NATO ally, and the US already has a military base on it. Tillis pointed out that, at the peak of US cooperation, the US had 17 military facilities there. He also rejected the idea that projecting US power from Greenland requires some financial transaction. He said that path doesn't even appeal to him as a fiscal conservative. "I think over time, hopefully we will get to the president to recognize that and have the policy that's commensurate with that," he said. A blue-and-white Boeing C-32A departed Joint Base Andrews a few hours ago and is now approaching Europe. Its call sign, SAM696, suggests it's carrying a high-ranking official but not the president. Another US government airplane landed in Switzerland at 6:40 a.m. CET, before Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent appeared in Davos. Argentina's President Javier Milei appeared to arrive in Zurich at 3:13 p.m. CET. His government's Boeing 757 jet, registered as "ARG-01," briefly stopped in the Canary Islands, per ADS-B Exchange data.

French President Emmanuel Macron was onstage today, after two state-owned Dassault private jets arrived from an air base near Paris around 9:30 a.m. CET. We've also seen airplanes owned by the governments or militaries of Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Czechia, Egypt, Israel, the Netherlands, Pakistan, Poland, and Sweden. President Donald Trump is scheduled to speak tomorrow. Microsoft President Brad Smith said at a panel on AI and geopolitics that local resistance to data centers is the "big issues" for tech companies investing in AI right now. Smith listed a variety of concerns that people who live near data centers are raising, including whether electricity prices will rise, whether water pressure in their homes will be impacted by the centers' water use, and who will benefit most from new jobs.

Smith listed a variety of concerns that people who live near data centers are raising, including whether electricity prices will rise, whether water pressure in their homes will be impacted by the centers' water use, and who will benefit most from new jobs. "Those are completely legitimate questions, and I think it's incumbent on all of us in the industry in the United States to address them head-on and offer the kinds of assurances that people need," Smith said. Smith's comments come one week after Microsoft detailed a plan for "community-first AI infrastructure" that includes paying higher rates for the electricity their facilities consume. That followed a post from President Donald Trump calling on tech companies to "pay their own way" for data centers. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff on Tuesday again called out tech companies for abusing Section 230, this time with Google's president sitting just feet away. "The social media companies have not been held responsible for the damage they did," Benioff said at a World Economic Forum panel. The Salesforce CEO owns Time Magazine, which he said is responsible for what it publishes. "These tech companies are not," he said.

The Salesforce CEO owns Time Magazine, which he said is responsible for what it publishes. "These tech companies are not," he said. Benioff also criticized Character.AI after watching a "60 Minutes" documentary about the company's impact on children. It was "maybe the darkest thing I've ever seen with technology," Benioff said. He made similar statements about Section 230 and Character.AI earlier this month. Google president and chief investment officer Ruth Porat sat two seats down from Benioff on the panel. Her company runs one of the social media sites, YouTube, that benefits from Section 230. Google also paid $2.5 billion to license Character.AI's technology and hire its key talent in 2024. The panel's moderator said that Porat had a "right to reply." Porat said there were areas where regulation was needed, but the upside was significant. As a cancer survivor, Porat highlighted the potential to democratize early detection in oncology through AI. "I don't want to give up on those kinds of things," she said. Benioff responded, saying we can learn from what happened with social media. He referenced some governments banning social media for people under certain ages. "That's a big step," Benioff said. "That wasn't true 10 years ago." The biggest theme emerging from my conversations so far this week is that AI hasn't delivered the tangible productivity gains executives expected. The question everyone's trying to answer is: How do we fix that? One approach is an "AI or else" approach, shoving it down employees' throats (e.g., incorporating AI use in performance reviews). But at a Business Insider roundtable I moderated this morning, the chief people officers at many of the world's largest companies advised a gentler approach.

But at a Business Insider roundtable I moderated this morning, the chief people officers at many of the world's largest companies advised a gentler approach. Cisco, for example, found that when it mandated AI training, it not only failed to drive adoption but actually had a negative impact. What was more successful was "providing choice," said Francine Katsoudas, the chief people, policy, and purpose officer at Cisco — like when it gave its engineers access to half a dozen AI tools, so they themselves could decide which tools to use and how to use them. "I do believe that we have to work really, really hard to make AI a team sport." One of the most fun parts about being at Davos is walking along the main promenade to people-watch and try the free snacks and drinks that companies and foreign governments hand out. Since this is a snowy mountain town, coffee, tea, and hot chocolate are popular. One of the most fun parts about being at Davos is walking along the main promenade to people-watch and try the free snacks and drinks that companies and foreign governments hand out. Since this is a snowy mountain town, coffee, tea, and hot chocolate are popular. One of the tastiest items I've had is the orange hot chocolate at Meta's house. To order, I had to scan a QR code, which took me to Meta-owned WhatsApp, where a disclaimer popped up. "Meta shares your commitment to the highest standards of ethical conduct and transparency," it said. "This hospitality is valued at USD $13." Luckily, our Business Insider policies allow me to accept free hot chocolate, and a minute later, a friendly barista served up the drink, topped with whipped cream, a marshmallow, and a wafer with the Meta logo. It was piping hot, not too sweet, and delicious. A recent warning out of Davos highlights that even the world's business elite can fall prey to online scams. Fake VIP passes for the USA House — America's privately funded celebration site at the World Economic Forum's event in Davos, Switzerland — have hit the market. In a statement on its website, the USA House warned those attending not to be duped. "We will not give access to people who purchased such packages," the statement reads. "Our sympathies to those who fell victim to these scams."

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick doesn't want to talk about Greenland, as President Donald Trump's statements about the autonomous Danish territory roil global markets. "No, it's not necessary," Lutnick told panel host Adam Tooze, an economic historian, when Tooze tried to steer the conversation back to the topic looming over Davos. "I think America and the Western Hemisphere are vital to America, and I'm going to leave that to my national security people to address." Top economic officials in the UK and Canada, who joined Lutnick on the panel, sprinkled in reminders in their remarks that the White House should not forget its allies, though they offered no specific condemnation of Trump's repeated suggestions that the US may try to seize Greenland. "What I urge Howard and others in the administration just to think of is just how your allies can help you achieve your objectives," Rachel Reeves, the UK's Chancellor of the Exchequer, said. Later, during an open Q&A, Lutnick was pressed on how the US would respond if Europe imposed retaliatory tariffs should Trump follow through on his threat to impose tariffs on European countries for not supporting his views on Greenland. Lutnick said if Europe responds with tariffs of its own, the standoff will eventually end with a meeting between President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen and Trump, as happened previously. "If we're going to have a kerfuffle, so be it," Lutnick said. "But we know how it's going to end." Davos often attracts an older crowd, but I had lunch with two young tech founders here, one of whom is not old enough to drink in the US "This is one of the few places in the world where I can have a drink and not feel so guilty about it," said Cameron Fink, the 20-year-old Dartmouth dropout who is cofounder and CEO of Aaru, which is building AI-driven software that it says can predict future events.

"I did meet one person younger than me, but they happened to be the child of the World Economic Forum delegate, so I don't know if that counts." Fink and his 21-year-old cofounder, Ned Koh, were dressed in suits. They dressed up to try to make them look older, lest they be confused for interns. To save money, they are not staying in Davos, but 30 minutes away by train. "The Davos accommodations are like $30,000, Fink said. "That doesn't exist in our founder budget." Ned used 390,000 United Airlines miles to travel here in business class, which he said was worth it because he spent the trip networking. "If you look at the people around you and you start to look at logos on backpacks, you'll see that like half of America's biggest CEOs are sitting next to you," said Koh. Nela Richardson, chief economist at ADP, described the US job market in three words to a Davos audience: "K-shaped, concentrated, and choppy." Consumer spending is high among wealthier Americans, but middle- and lower-income households are struggling to find work and pay bills. It's a gap that she expects will widen, especially as healthcare and hospitality are among the only fields showing real growth.

It's a gap that she expects will widen, especially as healthcare and hospitality are among the only fields showing real growth. Besides the gloomy jobs outlook, a group of top economists and bank leaders said Tuesday that the global economy is resilient. Potential AI and credit bubbles might be a risk to markets — though data centers are still a worthy investment. "We're not in a productivity bubble," Richardson, who was one of the panelists, said. "What AI has promised, it can deliver: higher standards of living, higher growth rates." She expects the US will need more specialized blue-collar workers to build data centers and stay competitive. "It's going to take an infrastructure that is able to keep up with the development, and right now, we don't have it."

Trump is dominating not only conversations in Davos, but also the narrative in the markets. Stocks across the board have plunged on Tuesday morning, with investors showing their anxiety about the Greenland fight. Major indexes on both sides of the Atlantic are down sharply, having previously largely ignored Trump's threats to take over Greenland.

The weather is sunny and (relatively) warm in Davos, but there's a definite chill in the air. Maybe it's the heightened security. Maybe it's the long lines already forming. Maybe it's that there are reportedly a lot more people here than there have been in a long time. Whatever the case, everyone seems to be on edge. Multiple attendees told me they were already feeling exhausted, as if we were halfway through the week, even though we're just getting started. President Donald Trump's ongoing threats against Europe over his desire to take over Greenland have been a big talking point. Speculation continues to swirl about his Wednesday address.

I've asked a lot of finance executives this week about AI's impact on the workplace. Specifically, how the tech's automation could suck up the need for junior roles. All of them stressed the importance of attracting critical, creative thinkers, since so much of the hard financial analysis can be done by the bots. That means they'd look for talent outside traditional finance tracks. Don't sweat it, Wharton folks. They're still interested in your types. Just don't be surprised if you're rubbing shoulders with an Art History major in your analyst class. Selling AI chips to China would be "like selling nuclear weapons to North Korea," according to Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, who described the idea as "crazy." Speaking to Bloomberg at Davos on Tuesday, Amodei said that Trump's decision to sell Nvidia AI chips to China would be a mistake that could have major national security implications.

There were at least 157 yesterday, arriving from more than 40 different countries. The longest trip was made by one that belongs to Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, according to JetSpy data. It flew for 14.5 hours from Hawaii. JetSpy also showed numerous companies' private jets arriving in the area, including those of Aramco, BlackRock, Google, and JPMorgan Chase. The most popular type was the Gulfstream G650, which typically costs over $65 million. Read full story Green "is my happy color," she said, saying bright colors help when "the world is so dark."

French President Emmanuel Macron channeled his inner "Top Gun" during a panel discussion with WEF cochair Larry Fink, sporting a pair of aviator sunglasses. In a special address, Macron criticized Trump's tariffs, calling them "fundamentally unacceptable." "Competition from the United States of America through trade agreements that undermine our export interests, demand maximum concessions, and openly aim to weaken and subordinate Europe, combined with an endless accumulation of new tariffs that are fundamentally unacceptable, even more so when they are used as leverage against territorial sovereignty," he said. While it isn't clear exactly why Macron sported sunglasses, he appeared in public last week with a swollen, red right eye, opening a speech at a French military base by saying: "Please pardon the unsightly appearance of my eye." He described his issue as "something completely harmless." The presence of senior figures from US politics is noticeable in Davos this year. Business Insider's Ben Bergman has spotted both Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and former House speaker and longtime Trump ally, Newt Gingrich, on the ground today. A reminder: Trump addresses Davos tomorrow at 2 p.m. local time. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said he believes people will eventually realize AI may demand "macroeconomic intervention." "If we look at just the disparities in wealth that we have now, if we look at it as a fraction of GDP, I believe we've kind of exceeded the Gilded Age already, and this is mostly without AI," he said.

However, asked about the California wealth tax, Amodei said the proposal was "poorly designed" and called for more "sober" thinking about tech's economic impact. Private jets belonging to Bill Gates and Michael Dell touched down at Zurich Airport around lunchtime, according to data from JetSpy. Gates' Gulfstream G650 came from Madrid, about two hours away. It was on the ground in the Spanish capital for 24 hours after arriving from California. The Microsoft cofounder is scheduled to speak about healthcare tomorrow.

Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, the world's largest asset management firm, kicked off the World Economic Forum on Tuesday with a critique of capitalism. More wealth has been created since the fall of the Berlin Wall than at any other time in human history, but it has not translated into shared prosperity, said Fink, who was appointed as interim cochair of the World Economic Forum in August 2025, replacing founder Klaus Schwab. "In advanced economies, that wealth has accrued to a far narrower share of people than any healthy society can ultimately sustain," he said.

As traffic jams snarl the streets of Davos, conversations about the autonomous future of cars are getting a lot of airtime. Earlier, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi was asked about the investment landscape around robotaxis, and said he doesn't think the investment market in autonomous vehicles is overheated. As traffic jams snarl the streets of Davos, conversations about the autonomous future of cars are getting a lot of airtime. Earlier, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi was asked about the investment landscape around robotaxis, and said he doesn't think the investment market in autonomous vehicles is overheated. However, he says the broader AI market — foundation models, hardware, semiconductors — has "heated up significantly," with "very aggressive assumptions of forward growth." Asked if Uber might invest in Waymo, Khosrowshahi said "no comment." "They have plenty of money," he said. "But we're investing across the ecosystem, and we're very bullish." Editor's note: This post has been updated to more accurately reflect Khosrowshahi's comments. With schedules full of back-to-back meetings and most shops on the promenade taken over by businesses, eating during the day can be tough. Some businesses set up grab-and-go food and drink stations. That's what Pinterest did, and this morning, sweet croissants were on the menu.

I asked him about President Donald Trump's upcoming speech. He had this to say: "I'm hoping there's an expression of strength in numbers, and we're better together kind of story. Now, that said, I believe this idea that taking a strong 'America First' approach is good for this country. "I think it's setting a tone and a change of direction from where we've been the last 50 years. So, I think it's refreshing. I don't even want to anticipate what's going to happen tomorrow because I have no idea." Speaking earlier this morning, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said he is skeptical about some companies claiming rapid AI transformation, and that getting it right comes down to culture.

Uber tried building customer service AI that followed its old policies, Khosrowshahi told the audience at Davos, but it was only "OK." That changed after the developers started from scratch with AI in mind. Companies are essentially rule systems, he said.

Davos attracts a real cross-section of the world's rich and powerful, ranging from investors and politicians to sporting legends. Soccer great and longtime UNICEF ambassador David Beckham was spotted recording a podcast this morning. At last year's Davos, Beckham was awarded the Crystal Award, which recognized his contributions to "advocating for children's rights, education and well-being." Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, who spoke in a morning panel led by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, shared how he has always prepared for Davos meetings — and how that's changed with AI. He said his field team used to prep him for 50 or so meetings, according to a "particular workflow."

He said his field team used to prep him for 50 or so meetings, according to a "particular workflow." "Nothing had really changed since I joined in '92 to essentially even a few years back," he said about the year he joined the tech giant as an engineer. "Whereas now, I just go to Copilot and say, "Hey, I'm meeting Larry. Please give me a brief." He added that the briefs generated by Microsoft's AI assistant give him a comprehensive overview of the relationship between his firm and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink's team. AI tools are also changing the traditional bottom-to-top flow of information, he said. "In fact, what I do is I take that and immediately share that back with all my colleagues across all the functions," he said. "Think about it. It's a complete inversion of how information is flowing in the organization." Robot drivers will ultimately outperform humans on safety, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said on Tuesday in Davos. "If you think about the world 20 years from now, your Uber is going to be driven largely not by a human being, but by a robot driver — a piece of software on top of a car," Khosrowshahi said, adding that vehicles are becoming increasingly sophisticated and more like "computers on wheels."

Khosrowshahi said autonomous systems have clear advantages over human drivers. "There's no doubt in my mind that the robot driver can be safer than a human driver," he said. Robot drivers don't get tired or distracted, don't text while driving, and can operate continuously while improving over time, he added. The key question, Khosrowshahi said, is what level of safety is "enough" for robot drivers — whether matching human performance is sufficient or whether autonomous vehicles should be held to a higher standard. In the longer term, he said, human driving could resemble horseback riding today, becoming a niche activity done for enjoyment. "There's no doubt that 10 years from now, there will be questions as to whether humans are safe enough," he said. Trump is expected to arrive in Davos on Wednesday. While Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent wants business leaders to take a breath and chill out about Greenland, that may not be in the cards. Trump posted on Truth Social on Thursday that he had "a very good telephone call with Mark Rutte, the Secretary General of NATO, concerning Greenland." Trump is expected to arrive in Davos on Wednesday. While Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent wants business leaders to take a breath and chill out about Greenland, that may not be in the cards. Trump posted on Truth Social on Thursday that he had "a very good telephone call with Mark Rutte, the Secretary General of NATO, concerning Greenland." "I agreed to a meeting of the various parties in Davos, Switzerland. As I expressed to everyone, very plainly, Greenland is imperative for National and World Security," Trump wrote. Trump on Sunday had sent messages to Norway's leader, saying the US requires "Complete and Total Control of Greenland." Greenland is a semi-autonomous Danish territory. Governments keep changing their rules on EVs, says BYD executive vice president Stella Li, and that sets carmakers back. Li said in a panel at Davos that when countries go "back and forth" on their EV policy, it creates a pattern that "will confuse manufacturers." In contrast, when governments give a "very clear line," automakers can focus on execution, Li said.

When asked about what European business leaders should do, Bessent's take was to "sit back" and "relax." "What I am urging everyone here to do is sit back, take a deep breath, and let things play out," Bessent said. "I am confident that the leaders will not escalate and that this will work out in a manner that ends up in a very good place for all, for national security, for the US, and for Europe," he said. Anything you do within your company's digital ecosystem is likely being tracked, from the data you touch to the software programs you use. But AI agents, not so much. That's a real concern as we rely on them more and more, Raj Sharma, EY's global managing partner of growth and innovation, told me. "We have to build industrial-level security for AI agents in that particular area," he said. "That keeps me up at night," Sharma added. For Tim Walsh, the chair and CEO of KPMG US, it's the threat of quantum computing. While still a few years out, its power is undeniable. "Quantum breaks everything," Walsh said.

But it's also obvious that the world now places far less trust in us to help shape what comes next." Fink said the capitalism now faces a big test: Whether it can "evolve to turn more people into owners of growth, instead of spectators watching it happen." "And that kind of change is hard. Especially in a world of competing ideologies and assumptions about how the system should work," he said. Fink's remarks ground what is expected to be a monumental week, in which deals are made and new alliances are forged amid turmoil in the wider political sphere.

Title: Letters: The social media illusion can leave you feeling like your nice life isn’t enough

Influencers online can make you feel like your life doesn't measure up and that you are missing out. Stock image: Getty In my younger days, I aspired simply to be Liverpool FC’s Tommy Smith, crunching tackles on a wet and muddy Anfield pitch. Age soon nullified that ambition, but at least my reference points were real and achievable. Today, social media has removed those limits. TikTok and Instagram feed us a parade of influencers with designer kitchens, Mediterranean villas and endless leisure. These lifestyles feel normal and attainable, and quietly many ask: “Why isn’t my life like that?” In Ireland, with eye-watering rents, elusive mortgages and delayed independence, it is hardly surprising that a decent salary and modest flat can feel like failure. We’ve always seen aspirational images in ads or TV shows, but social media feels real – even when it represents the top few per cent of earners or carefully curated illusion. If this “financial dysmorphia” is taking hold, no amount of economic growth alone will make everyone feel successful. Perhaps the quieter remedies matter more: good public spaces, affordable transport, liveable towns and a culture that values contentment over conspicuous display. And sometimes, we might all benefit from putting the phone down and noticing the perfectly adequate lives we already lead. Enda Cullen, Tullysaran Road, Co Armagh Parents have a right to make decisions on behalf of their children concerning their moral upbringing. But what I don’t agree with is a parent’s decision to oblige their unsuspecting very young children to join a highly complex organisation like the Catholic Church. In free societies like we have here in Ireland, parents don’t oblige their children to join any political party soon after they are born. This is because, I believe, our political party leaders would then be treated for ever like dear father and mother figures and so they would very likely start to stay on running Ireland for way too long. But because children in Ireland are baptised at way too early an age, they soon learn, in an immature way, not to question how their church is run. And because of this infringement of their religious freedom, any real and practical change – sadly – happens within the Catholic Church at a much too slow and glacial pace. Sean O’Brien, Kilrush, Co Clare Eric Conway (‘Thank you, Mr Trump, for finally coming to the aid of Nigeria’s Christian people’, Irish Independent, letters, January 17) seems to be of the impression that Donald Trump was the deserved recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize. In fact, Trump has further humiliated himself by parading the Nobel Peace Medal without the honour of earning or winning it. He does this while threatening to take control of Greenland, supposedly in the interest of American security, but more likely in order to enrich him and his billionaire benefactors while putting the existence of Nato in serious jeopardy. Moscow and Beijing can rejoice in the work that he is doing on their behalf as Trump is singlehandedly fracturing the alliances that have stood since the end of the Second World War. While Mr Conway wishes God’s blessing on Mr Trump, it may be of little benefit to this volatile, narcissistic character but then, God, it is said, works in strange ways. Jimmy O’Brien, Dukesmeadows, Co Kilkenny As a European country, Ireland is in a unique position. This gives the country a stronger role in the current Greenland “debate”. It’s not in Nato, so it can ignore Trump’s silly quest without breaking any arrangements. And more – why doesn’t Greenland just kick out the existing US forces from the island? Invite them back on your terms if and when they behave... In 1922 Ireland kicked out the most powerful force on the planet. I hope the current Greenland prime minister is talking with the Taoiseach on the path ahead. Gerard Walsh, Port Elgin, Ontario In the current game of high-stakes poker, Trump has the trump card. “Play ball with me on Greenland or fight Putin on your own.” Game, set and match... Pat O’Brien, Newmarket-on-Fergus, Co Clare I would imagine that Americans would say that they don’t want Venezuela, Greenland, Cuba, Mexico, etc. I feel they would far more likely be concerned with affordable healthcare and housing. They want good jobs. One wonders if the Trump administration is somewhat deaf to these needs. John O’Brien, Clonmel, Co Tipperary A friend who, unlike the undersigned, is a keen gardener, tells me he is delighted to see the first shoots of snowdrops in his garden. Indeed when he has also seen daffodils, butterflies and bees, he will have seen all kinds of everything. Tom Gilsenan, Beaumont, Dublin 9 Kerry people and many others will be delighted at the remarkable success of Jessie Buckley, the actor. Her great-grandmother, Madge Clifford, was also an exceptional person. Just one of her significant contributions was her service as confidential secretary to Austin Stack, home affairs minister, when together they administered the Republican Courts and Police in 1921-22.

Title: Kevin Warsh soars ahead of Kevin Hassett in Polymarket, Kalshi odds on next Fed chair after Trump signal

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/19/2026 8:02:03 PM PST by SeekAndFind Former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh soared ahead of National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett on prediction markets betting on the next Fed chair after President Trump on Friday hinted that Hassett might be out of the running. Trump did not reveal his final choice to replace Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, but said he would like to keep Hassett in his current role. “I see Kevin’s in the audience, and I just want to thank you. You were fantastic on television today,” the president said during remarks at the White House on Friday. “I actually want to keep you where you are, if you want to know the truth.” The odds of Warsh clinching the nomination jumped to 60% on Polymarket as of Friday afternoon, while traders placed just a 17% chance that Hassett would land the job – following weeks in which markets placed better odds on Hassett. Current Fed Governor Christopher Waller, who has been considered a long shot, came in at 15%. Traders saw just a 6% chance that BlackRock exec Rick Rieder could win the role. Warsh also jumped to 59% odds on Kalshi, another prediction market. Hassett and Waller got 18% and 14% odds, respectively. Trump has not set a specific date to name his pick for the next chairman. Powell’s term at the helm expires in May, though he could choose to stay on the board through 2028. He has so far declined to comment on whether he will remain a Fed governor. On Sunday, Powell publicly shared that he’s under criminal investigation for allegedly lying during congressional testimony last summer — a stunning development that came after years of Trump blasting the chair for failing to lower interest rates quickly enough.

This is from a Financial Newsletter I subscribe to: ___________________________________ As of last week, Kevin Warsh emerged as the front-runner to succeed Jerome Powell as Chair of the Federal Reserve. His potential selection is a significant point of discussion for financial markets due to his unique blend of Wall Street experience and hawkish economic views. Warsh was appointed to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors by President George W. Bush. He was sworn in on February 24, 2006, at the age of 35, making him the youngest person ever appointed to the Board of Governors in the history of the Federal Reserve. Bush nominated him on January 27, 2006, to fill the unexpired term previously held by Ben Bernanke, who had just become Fed Chair. At the time, his appointment was controversial due to his age and perceived lack of experience compared to typical Fed governors. However, he became a central figure during the 2008 financial crisis, serving as the Fed’s primary liaison to Wall Street and a key advisor to Chairman Bernanke. While appointed by Bush, Warsh continued to serve into the Barack Obama administration before resigning in March 2011. Warsh’s experience during that 2007-2009 financial crisis provides the best clues for how he might lead the Fed in 2026. While only in his late thirties during the crisis, Warsh held an outsized influence that surpassed many of his more senior colleagues. Prior to his public service, he was an Executive Director at Morgan Stanley in Mergers and Acquisitions. Because of his background at Morgan Stanley, he was the Fed’s primary point of contact for the CEOs of the major investment banks. When the system began to “freeze,” Warsh was the person on the phone with terrified bank executives, translating the chaos of the trading floor for the academic economists at the Fed. He was a key architect in the forced takeovers and bailouts of 2008. He helped negotiate JPMorgan’s acquisition of Bear Stearns and was a central figure in the discussions surrounding the AIG bailout and the fateful decision to let Lehman Brothers fail. He spent a significant amount of time on Capitol Hill, acting as a salesman for the Fed’s emergency measures to skeptical Republican lawmakers, who were wary of government intervention. Although he initially supported the emergency measures (like cutting rates to zero), Warsh eventually became one of the first and most vocal critics of the Fed’s long-term reliance on “easy money.” In 2010, he publicly broke with Ben Bernanke in a Wall Street Journal op-ed, questioning the second round of Quantitative Easing (QE2). He worried that printing money to buy bonds would lead to long-term inflation and “market distortions.” He famously referred to Quantitative Easing as a “reverse Robin Hood” policy, arguing that it benefited wealthy asset holders (stock and real estate owners) while doing little for the average “Main Street” worker. He resigned from the Fed in 2011, seven years before his term was set to expire, largely because he disagreed with the direction of monetary policy and felt the Fed was becoming too entangled with political and fiscal goals. Historically, Warsh is known as an “inflation hawk.” He has famously stated that “inflation is a choice,” arguing that price levels are driven by the decisions of fiscal and monetary authorities rather than just external shocks. While traditionally hawkish, he recently expressed support for interest rate cuts combined with aggressive balance sheet reduction (quantitative tightening). This “rate cuts + QT” approach is seen as a pragmatic compromise that aligns with current political desires for lower rates while maintaining long-term price stability. If Warsh is confirmed as Chair in May 2026, his past suggests a strategic reset. He has recently argued that the Fed has “strayed from its remit.” He would likely prioritize shrinking the Fed’s balance sheet more aggressively than Jerome Powell has. He prefers using market signals (like bond yields and commodity prices) to guide interest rates, rather than relying solely on the Fed’s internal economic models, which he believes often fail to predict inflation. Warsh has proposed a specific strategy called “Pragmatic Monetarism” to help manage this burden. His plan focuses on a dual-track approach: shrinking the Fed’s own balance sheet to lower the cost of the debt, rather than just the debt itself. Unlike some who want to raise the inflation target to 3%, Warsh remains a staunch advocate for a strict 2% (or lower) target, viewing price stability as the “North Star” for a healthy economy. Warsh argues that for the last 15 years, the Fed has practiced “fiscal dominance” — essentially keeping interest rates artificially low to make it easier for the government to borrow trillions. He wants to end the “printing press” era. He believes that by stopping the Fed’s massive purchase of government bonds, he can force a clearer separation between the Treasury (which spends) and the Fed (which manages money). This is his most distinctive proposal. He argues that the Fed’s $7 trillion balance sheet is actually keeping interest rates higher than they need to be. He reasons that if the Fed aggressively sells off its assets in the form of quantitative tightening, it “quiets the printing press.” Warsh believes that a smaller, more disciplined Fed balance sheet reduces inflation expectations so effectively that the Fed can then lower interest rates for households and businesses without causing inflation to spike. Lower interest rates, in turn, reduce the interest expense the government has to pay on that $38 trillion. His current activities include serving as the Shepard Family Distinguished Visiting Fellow in Economics at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution. He is a lecturer and Dean’s Visiting Scholar, where he teaches and conducts research on economics and finance. He remains a member of the Board of Directors of UPS and Coupang. He is a partner at Duquesne Family Office LLC, working alongside billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller. He is a member of the Group of Thirty (G30), an international body of leading financiers and academics, and serves on the Panel of Economic Advisers for the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). Based on his experience in financial crisis management, his understanding of Wall Street, his communicative skills demonstrated on Capitol Hill and his passion to reign in the $38 trillion debt and drive inflation lower, Kevin Warsh is squarely in the spotlight to be the next Fed Chair. 2 posted on 01/19/2026 8:06:09 PM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind Just abolish the Fed and get it over with.

This is from a Financial Newsletter I subscribe to: ___________________________________ As of last week, Kevin Warsh emerged as the front-runner to succeed Jerome Powell as Chair of the Federal Reserve. His potential selection is a significant point of discussion for financial markets due to his unique blend of Wall Street experience and hawkish economic views. Warsh was appointed to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors by President George W. Bush. He was sworn in on February 24, 2006, at the age of 35, making him the youngest person ever appointed to the Board of Governors in the history of the Federal Reserve. Bush nominated him on January 27, 2006, to fill the unexpired term previously held by Ben Bernanke, who had just become Fed Chair. At the time, his appointment was controversial due to his age and perceived lack of experience compared to typical Fed governors. However, he became a central figure during the 2008 financial crisis, serving as the Fed’s primary liaison to Wall Street and a key advisor to Chairman Bernanke. While appointed by Bush, Warsh continued to serve into the Barack Obama administration before resigning in March 2011. Warsh’s experience during that 2007-2009 financial crisis provides the best clues for how he might lead the Fed in 2026. While only in his late thirties during the crisis, Warsh held an outsized influence that surpassed many of his more senior colleagues. Prior to his public service, he was an Executive Director at Morgan Stanley in Mergers and Acquisitions. Because of his background at Morgan Stanley, he was the Fed’s primary point of contact for the CEOs of the major investment banks. When the system began to “freeze,” Warsh was the person on the phone with terrified bank executives, translating the chaos of the trading floor for the academic economists at the Fed. He was a key architect in the forced takeovers and bailouts of 2008. He helped negotiate JPMorgan’s acquisition of Bear Stearns and was a central figure in the discussions surrounding the AIG bailout and the fateful decision to let Lehman Brothers fail. He spent a significant amount of time on Capitol Hill, acting as a salesman for the Fed’s emergency measures to skeptical Republican lawmakers, who were wary of government intervention. Although he initially supported the emergency measures (like cutting rates to zero), Warsh eventually became one of the first and most vocal critics of the Fed’s long-term reliance on “easy money.” In 2010, he publicly broke with Ben Bernanke in a Wall Street Journal op-ed, questioning the second round of Quantitative Easing (QE2). He worried that printing money to buy bonds would lead to long-term inflation and “market distortions.” He famously referred to Quantitative Easing as a “reverse Robin Hood” policy, arguing that it benefited wealthy asset holders (stock and real estate owners) while doing little for the average “Main Street” worker. He resigned from the Fed in 2011, seven years before his term was set to expire, largely because he disagreed with the direction of monetary policy and felt the Fed was becoming too entangled with political and fiscal goals. Historically, Warsh is known as an “inflation hawk.” He has famously stated that “inflation is a choice,” arguing that price levels are driven by the decisions of fiscal and monetary authorities rather than just external shocks. While traditionally hawkish, he recently expressed support for interest rate cuts combined with aggressive balance sheet reduction (quantitative tightening). This “rate cuts + QT” approach is seen as a pragmatic compromise that aligns with current political desires for lower rates while maintaining long-term price stability. If Warsh is confirmed as Chair in May 2026, his past suggests a strategic reset. He has recently argued that the Fed has “strayed from its remit.” He would likely prioritize shrinking the Fed’s balance sheet more aggressively than Jerome Powell has. He prefers using market signals (like bond yields and commodity prices) to guide interest rates, rather than relying solely on the Fed’s internal economic models, which he believes often fail to predict inflation. Warsh has proposed a specific strategy called “Pragmatic Monetarism” to help manage this burden. His plan focuses on a dual-track approach: shrinking the Fed’s own balance sheet to lower the cost of the debt, rather than just the debt itself. Unlike some who want to raise the inflation target to 3%, Warsh remains a staunch advocate for a strict 2% (or lower) target, viewing price stability as the “North Star” for a healthy economy. Warsh argues that for the last 15 years, the Fed has practiced “fiscal dominance” — essentially keeping interest rates artificially low to make it easier for the government to borrow trillions. He wants to end the “printing press” era. He believes that by stopping the Fed’s massive purchase of government bonds, he can force a clearer separation between the Treasury (which spends) and the Fed (which manages money). This is his most distinctive proposal. He argues that the Fed’s $7 trillion balance sheet is actually keeping interest rates higher than they need to be. He reasons that if the Fed aggressively sells off its assets in the form of quantitative tightening, it “quiets the printing press.” Warsh believes that a smaller, more disciplined Fed balance sheet reduces inflation expectations so effectively that the Fed can then lower interest rates for households and businesses without causing inflation to spike. Lower interest rates, in turn, reduce the interest expense the government has to pay on that $38 trillion. His current activities include serving as the Shepard Family Distinguished Visiting Fellow in Economics at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution. He is a lecturer and Dean’s Visiting Scholar, where he teaches and conducts research on economics and finance. He remains a member of the Board of Directors of UPS and Coupang. He is a partner at Duquesne Family Office LLC, working alongside billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller. He is a member of the Group of Thirty (G30), an international body of leading financiers and academics, and serves on the Panel of Economic Advisers for the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). Based on his experience in financial crisis management, his understanding of Wall Street, his communicative skills demonstrated on Capitol Hill and his passion to reign in the $38 trillion debt and drive inflation lower, Kevin Warsh is squarely in the spotlight to be the next Fed Chair. 2 posted on 01/19/2026 8:06:09 PM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind Just abolish the Fed and get it over with.

This is from a Financial Newsletter I subscribe to: ___________________________________ As of last week, Kevin Warsh emerged as the front-runner to succeed Jerome Powell as Chair of the Federal Reserve. His potential selection is a significant point of discussion for financial markets due to his unique blend of Wall Street experience and hawkish economic views. Warsh was appointed to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors by President George W. Bush. He was sworn in on February 24, 2006, at the age of 35, making him the youngest person ever appointed to the Board of Governors in the history of the Federal Reserve. Bush nominated him on January 27, 2006, to fill the unexpired term previously held by Ben Bernanke, who had just become Fed Chair. At the time, his appointment was controversial due to his age and perceived lack of experience compared to typical Fed governors. However, he became a central figure during the 2008 financial crisis, serving as the Fed’s primary liaison to Wall Street and a key advisor to Chairman Bernanke. While appointed by Bush, Warsh continued to serve into the Barack Obama administration before resigning in March 2011. Warsh’s experience during that 2007-2009 financial crisis provides the best clues for how he might lead the Fed in 2026. While only in his late thirties during the crisis, Warsh held an outsized influence that surpassed many of his more senior colleagues. Prior to his public service, he was an Executive Director at Morgan Stanley in Mergers and Acquisitions. Because of his background at Morgan Stanley, he was the Fed’s primary point of contact for the CEOs of the major investment banks. When the system began to “freeze,” Warsh was the person on the phone with terrified bank executives, translating the chaos of the trading floor for the academic economists at the Fed. He was a key architect in the forced takeovers and bailouts of 2008. He helped negotiate JPMorgan’s acquisition of Bear Stearns and was a central figure in the discussions surrounding the AIG bailout and the fateful decision to let Lehman Brothers fail. He spent a significant amount of time on Capitol Hill, acting as a salesman for the Fed’s emergency measures to skeptical Republican lawmakers, who were wary of government intervention. Although he initially supported the emergency measures (like cutting rates to zero), Warsh eventually became one of the first and most vocal critics of the Fed’s long-term reliance on “easy money.” In 2010, he publicly broke with Ben Bernanke in a Wall Street Journal op-ed, questioning the second round of Quantitative Easing (QE2). He worried that printing money to buy bonds would lead to long-term inflation and “market distortions.” He famously referred to Quantitative Easing as a “reverse Robin Hood” policy, arguing that it benefited wealthy asset holders (stock and real estate owners) while doing little for the average “Main Street” worker. He resigned from the Fed in 2011, seven years before his term was set to expire, largely because he disagreed with the direction of monetary policy and felt the Fed was becoming too entangled with political and fiscal goals. Historically, Warsh is known as an “inflation hawk.” He has famously stated that “inflation is a choice,” arguing that price levels are driven by the decisions of fiscal and monetary authorities rather than just external shocks. While traditionally hawkish, he recently expressed support for interest rate cuts combined with aggressive balance sheet reduction (quantitative tightening). This “rate cuts + QT” approach is seen as a pragmatic compromise that aligns with current political desires for lower rates while maintaining long-term price stability. If Warsh is confirmed as Chair in May 2026, his past suggests a strategic reset. He has recently argued that the Fed has “strayed from its remit.” He would likely prioritize shrinking the Fed’s balance sheet more aggressively than Jerome Powell has. He prefers using market signals (like bond yields and commodity prices) to guide interest rates, rather than relying solely on the Fed’s internal economic models, which he believes often fail to predict inflation. Warsh has proposed a specific strategy called “Pragmatic Monetarism” to help manage this burden. His plan focuses on a dual-track approach: shrinking the Fed’s own balance sheet to lower the cost of the debt, rather than just the debt itself. Unlike some who want to raise the inflation target to 3%, Warsh remains a staunch advocate for a strict 2% (or lower) target, viewing price stability as the “North Star” for a healthy economy. Warsh argues that for the last 15 years, the Fed has practiced “fiscal dominance” — essentially keeping interest rates artificially low to make it easier for the government to borrow trillions. He wants to end the “printing press” era. He believes that by stopping the Fed’s massive purchase of government bonds, he can force a clearer separation between the Treasury (which spends) and the Fed (which manages money). This is his most distinctive proposal. He argues that the Fed’s $7 trillion balance sheet is actually keeping interest rates higher than they need to be. He reasons that if the Fed aggressively sells off its assets in the form of quantitative tightening, it “quiets the printing press.” Warsh believes that a smaller, more disciplined Fed balance sheet reduces inflation expectations so effectively that the Fed can then lower interest rates for households and businesses without causing inflation to spike. Lower interest rates, in turn, reduce the interest expense the government has to pay on that $38 trillion. His current activities include serving as the Shepard Family Distinguished Visiting Fellow in Economics at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution. He is a lecturer and Dean’s Visiting Scholar, where he teaches and conducts research on economics and finance. He remains a member of the Board of Directors of UPS and Coupang. He is a partner at Duquesne Family Office LLC, working alongside billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller. He is a member of the Group of Thirty (G30), an international body of leading financiers and academics, and serves on the Panel of Economic Advisers for the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).

Title: Kevin Hart’s Blacked-Out Ford Looks Straight Out of the ’70s, and Now It Can Be Yours

Learn more By: Ethan Brehm Published: Jan 19, 2026 By: Ethan Brehm Published: Jan 19, 2026 Kevin Hart’s custom 2024 Ford Bronco is headed to auction later this month, and it’s not your typical celebrity restomod. Instead of taking a classic Bronco and modernizing it, Hart did the reverse, buying a brand-new sixth-generation model and having it restyled to look like it rolled off the line in 1971. Working with builder Vintage Modern, he stripped away the modern bodywork and replaced it with custom panels that channel the first-generation Bronco. The one-of-one build goes up for sale at Barrett-Jackson’s Scottsdale auction with no reserve this week. For the exterior transformation, Hart and Vintage Modern swapped the factory panels for custom bodywork that mimics the ’60s- and ’70s-era Bronco, complete with the iconic round headlights, simple horizontal grille, narrow vertical taillights, and indelible orange side markers. Finished in Triple Black with matte accents, it’s paired with a removable soft top and BFGoodrich all-terrain rubber. Under the skin, though, it’s still very much a 2024 Bronco, featuring Ford’s 2.7-liter EcoBoost V6 pushing 330hp and 415lb.ft of torque through a 10-speed automatic. Fox Factory Racing suspension and Roush intake/exhaust round out the performance upgrades. Inside, there are hand-stitched Blackrock leather covers nearly every surface, while “Vintage” script hits the console and wheel. The digital driver display and center touchscreen stay put as well, while a Kenwood audio system handles the sound. All the contemporary safety gear (anti-lock brakes, airbags, crumple zones) remains intact. Ford’s decision to bring back the Bronco in 2021 marked the end of a 25-year absence. The sixth-generation model tapped into decades of pent-up demand for a legitimate Jeep Wrangler rival, offering removable doors and roof panels alongside serious off-road hardware like the HOSS suspension system and up to 11.6″ of ground clearance. Hart’s build takes advantage of that matured platform, using the mechanical stability of a fourth-year production model as the foundation for his retro transformation. Model: 2024 Ford Bronco (Custom) Engine: 2.7L EcoBoost V6 Power: 330 hp; 415 lb-ft torque Transmission: 10-speed automatic Suspension: Fox Factory Racing Intake/Exhaust: Roush Exterior: Triple Black with matte trim Interior: Hand-stitched Blackrock leather Audio: Kenwood system Tires: BFGoodrich all-terrain Edition: One-of-one This one-off 2024 Bronco build crosses the block at Barrett-Jackson’s Scottsdale 2026 auction, running January 17-25, with no reserve. Standard high-trim Broncos can push six figures depending on spec, but Hart’s celebrity provenance and Vintage Modern’s craftsmanship will likely drive the hammer price well beyond that. Kevin Hart’s custom 2024 Ford Bronco is hitting the Barrett-Jackson auction block later this month, and it’s basically a brand-new truck that’s been restyled to look like a first-generation model from the early ’70s. Working with Vintage Modern, Hart kept all the modern performance and tech but swapped the exterior for that classic boxy look.

By Tarik Cyril Amar, a historian from Germany working at Koç University, Istanbul, on Russia, Ukraine, and Eastern Europe, the history of World War II, the cultural Cold War, and the politics of memory By Tarik Cyril Amar, a historian from Germany working at Koç University, Istanbul, on Russia, Ukraine, and Eastern Europe, the history of World War II, the cultural Cold War, and the politics of memory As deplored in the Washington Post, Washington’s recent assault on Venezuela wasn’t just your usual US war of aggression/regime change operation but also served to facilitate a particular kind of insider trading. Or rather, betting: On the so-called ‘prediction’ platform Polymarket, a very well-informed investor wagered over $30,000 that Venezuela’s president Nicolas Maduro would be out of office by the last day of January and – lo and behold! – “walked away with more than $400,000 in profit.” That “prediction” was “timed with such pitch-perfect precision that it drew heavy media scrutiny” as it “bore the hallmarks of insider trading.” You. Don’t. Say. There’s cheating going on at the White House and among its hangers-on! Now, let’s be realistic: Real, existing capitalism – not the Friedrich von Hayek-Milton Friedman fan fiction that still dulls all too many minds – has always been ruthless. Its modern history of about half a millennium includes stupendous scientific, technological, and cultural change, as Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels acknowledged in their Communist Manifesto, parts of which read almost as a panegyric to the bourgeoisie and the capitalist world it made. But that world also began with the vicious impoverishment and exploitation of the masses, the plunder and devastation of whole continents and their original inhabitants, and a brisk international slave trade, vitiating and ending millions of lives. Marxists call this “primitive accumulation”; their master also used the term “original expropriation,” sardonically comparing its role in traditional political economy to man’s fall from divine grace in Christian mythology. After the establishment of first a traditional European great power empire under a radically new management dedicated to Communism in 1917 and then, one World War later, a whole Communist “second world” – centered in but not restricted to Eurasia – the capitalist regimes of the West slowly learned to tread a little more carefully, at least at home. Treating their populations to some reformist rhetoric, very moderate redistribution and unusually rational public spending, for a short moment in history the ruling – and owning – elites of countries such a West Germany and France almost looked as if in search of capitalism-with-a-human face. Even some American presidents weren’t ashamed to promise “progressive” things such as a “new deal” (Roosevelt) and a “great society” (Johnson). After the global neoliberal and right-libertarian surge and the end of most of that rival “second world” several decades ago, capitalism has become more brutally straightforward again everywhere. And not only in terms of the frank contempt its current elites – such as the real-estate billionaire who also runs the US and the BlackRock and Rothschild careerists who are in charge of Germany and France respectively – display for everyone not part of their exclusive, disdainful club. Plunder plain and simple was never gone from the repertory of capitalism, obviously. Just ask the Syrians what has happened to their oil, for instance. More than half a decade ago, in his first term, American buccaneer-in-chief Donald Trump, already had a moment of refreshing candor, openly acknowledging that the US military was in Syria (perfectly illegally under international law, of course) “to take the oil. I took the oil. The only troops I have [in Syria] are taking the oil.” Still, what Washington’s beasts of prey are doing to Venezuela now is an especially glaring example of shamelessness, a fresh peak performance (for now) of American chutzpah. The Trumpists and their media are positively reveling in their own iniquity. The robbing of Venezuela’s resources – what is already taking place and the much bigger plunder gleefully expected for the future – is celebrated in public. And if there is dissent, then only about the profits to be had, their prospective scale and whether they are quite as certain as Trump. (Spoiler alert: not, obviously.) Take the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), for instance, one of the top party organs of the international predator class (next to the likes of The Economist, Financial Times, and Bloomberg). Between the kidnapping of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro – with the killing of over a hundred Venezuelans and Cubans, at least – and the escalating media campaign to prepare for another war of aggression against Iran, the newspaper was busy with assessing the economic impact of future US exploitation of Venezuela’s oil: in essence, will it lower the global oil price? And if so, what does that mean for other oil producers, those in OPEC, but also, crucially, in the US (complicated, actually, with many domestic American oil producers dreading a price drop), for Trump, his Republicans and their domestic standing (the midterms are threatening and affordability remains an issue), and last and probably least, for ordinary Americans? Thankfully, the WSJ has also artlessly drawn attention to a particularly cynical aspect of the Great Venezuelan Oil (and gold, and lithium, and more) Robbery. No, not the insider betting at Polymarket but what it called the “Donroe Trade,” with investors “racing to capitalize on President Trump’s ambitions to dominate the Western Hemisphere,” that is, in less ideological language, on the windfalls from imperialism. There has been a “sharp rally” in Venezuelan debt – a regime change bet already noticed last December – boosting “hedge funds and other investment firms.” And, as good investors are supposed to do, they are also already “eyeing debt in Colombia and Cuba” and preparing for opportunities in Mexico and Greenland, too. Regarding Venezuela again, one firm at least is planning exploratory trips to inspect the loot and is “keeping in touch” with the White House. Venezuelans may have mixed feelings about the same firm having a history of organizing such trips to Ukraine and Syria. And if nothing else makes money, there still is the potentially very lucrative niche of doing business with arbitration claims. In short, the vultures aren’t just circling, they are pouncing. And the good old Wall Street Journal, unsurprisingly, finds all of that quite normal and as it should be. Yet, read another flagship publication of real-existing capitalism, Bloomberg, and you’ll find news that should give Washington’s triumphant pirates of the Caribbean food for thought. Just as enough investors were swarming into the ‘Donroe Trade’ of booty, pillage, and big boisterous promises to merit a lengthy WSJ article, a different kind of boom was taking place centered on a different region of the world: Asia, including China. There, Bloomberg reported, tech and AI stocks were “on a tear.” And this was not just any surge for stocks from Asia. Rather, investors – very much including those from the US – were “betting their momentum and outperformance against US peers will last through” all of 2026. The simple fact that these hopes shape the market mood is more important than the details. Investors are optimistic about Asian semiconductor supply chains, earnings potentials, and cutting-edge technological progress, while feeling worried about American tech and AI stocks’ ability to sustain their “rally after years of outsized gains,” in short, a typical US bubble. In particular, Bloomberg notes, “enthusiasm over [China’s] tech prowess has only grown in the new year.” China – that is, the geopolitical competitor that Washington is most obsessed with, next to Russia. This is a snapshot of a telling moment in history-on-the-move, no more. But take a step back and consider this picture in the round: In Venezuela, the US has – once again – proven its supreme legal and moral nihilism, as well as its ability to brutally beat up much weaker countries. It has also made a special point of letting the world know that the scourging of Caracas is meant as a lesson to frighten Latin America in particular and all of us in general. That on its own may look like a sort of success, or as they say in Washington, “a win.” But in reality, as the American historian Alfred McCoy – certainly no friend of either Russia or China – has observed, America “is an empire in decline.” Its lashing-out and crudely undisguised, even proud pillaging fundamentally reflects weakness, not strength. In the words of Emmanuel Todd, the brilliant French intellectual who correctly predicted the fall of the Soviet Union, and more recently, the “defeat of the West,” America is no longer capable of re-industrializing. It has become too incompetent in actually producing things or training the engineers and workers that can produce those things, even if Trump’s policy of tariffs and protectionism looks as if it is about bringing manufacturing home. What this late-state US is good at is extremely uninhibited violence and “predation,” that is, plain robbery. Ironically, capitalists sense this long-term change with the same acuity they display for the fleeting opportunities to profit from the ransacking of Venezuela. Yet none of this makes a difference to the fact that Washington is losing its grip. It can still inflict great pain and cause terrible destruction, but it cannot offer a vision of international – or, for that matter, domestic – order that attracts anyone who isn’t corrupt, submissive by nature, or witless.

Title: What CFOs Need to Know About the NYSE’s Tokenization Platform

Highlights The New York Stock Exchange has announced plans to develop a regulated platform for trading and on-chain settlement of tokenized securities. Tokenized equities could cut settlement from T+2 to near-instant, reducing risk and freeing capital, but they clash with existing U.S. securities laws and custody concepts overseen by the SEC. Despite unresolved regulation and industry pushback, growing support from major institutions suggests tokenization may move from experiment to core market infrastructure, leading CFOs to balance innovation with compliance. The digital asset space first wanted to replace the financial system. Now, the blockchain ecosystem is lowering its gaze from that sky-high goal and seeking instead merely to eliminate legacy inefficiencies in payments and capital markets.

Δ And that goal got a shot in the arm on Monday (Jan. 19) with the announcement that the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), part of Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (ICE), is developing a platform for the trading and on-chain settlement of tokenized securities, for which it will seek regulatory approvals. “For more than two centuries, the NYSE has transformed the way markets operate,” said Lynn Martin, president, NYSE Group, in a statement. “We are leading the industry toward fully on-chain solutions, grounded in the unmatched protections and high regulatory standards that position us to marry trust with state-of-the-art technology. Harnessing our expertise to reinvent market infrastructure is how we’ll meet and shape the demands of a digital future.” “Supporting tokenized securities is a pivotal step in ICE’s strategy to operate on-chain market infrastructure for trading, settlement, custody, and capital formation in the new era of global finance,” added Michael Blaugrund, vice president of strategic initiatives at ICE. For enterprise chief financial officers (CFOs) and treasury teams, tokenized equities represent both a strategic opportunity and a regulatory minefield. Unlike cryptocurrencies that function as native digital assets, tokenized equities are digital representations of traditional shares recorded on a blockchain, often with shareholder rights, dividends and governance linked to the underlying securities. But the broader question of how to harmonize centuries-old securities laws with decentralized technologies remains a defining, and as of yet unsolved, challenge for regulators, intermediaries and market participants alike. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue More here: Wall Street Moves On-Chain as Tokenization of US Stocks Goes Global At its essence, tokenization seeks to eliminate legacy inefficiencies in capital markets. Traditional settlement cycles, which are typically T+2 for U.S. equities, embed counterparty, operational and liquidity risks. By contrast, blockchain protocols promise near-instantaneous settlement, reducing counterparty exposure and shortening capital cycles. Tokenized equities, however, simply aren’t regulated by the U.S. At least, not yet. Last month, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Division of Trading and Markets Staff took a consequential, if incremental, step toward clarifying how traditional market intermediaries, specifically broker-dealers, should treat crypto asset securities. In the traditional securities world of equities, corporate bond, and registered funds, physical possession has a well-established meaning: either holding certificated securities or, more commonly today, maintaining accounts at centralized clearinghouses or custodians that satisfy regulatory “good control location” criteria. With tokenized securities residing on blockchain networks, however, the concept of physical possession is less tangible. Crypto asset “ownership” is typically defined by control over cryptographic private keys, and there is no centralized registry equivalent to the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) for many digital assets. This disconnect created regulatory uncertainty for broker-dealers that wish to carry tokenized securities on behalf of customers. Without clear interpretive guidance, intermediaries were left to extrapolate from existing frameworks, or to rely on outdated advisory statements that did not fully contemplate modern distributed ledger technology (DLT). PYMNTS covered Wednesday (Jan. 14) how the blockchain-based lender Figure has launched a way for companies to list their equity native on blockchain. The company claimed that its initiative differs from other tokenization efforts in that OPEN equities are blockchain registered, and not a tokenized version of DTCC securities. And we explored the tokenization topic over this past summer in an interview with Brett McLain, head of payments and blockchain at cryptocurrency exchange Kraken. “The tokenization of real-world assets [has] long been a holy grail for crypto … making those real-world assets more accessible globally to consumers,” McLain said. “We want to see that grow into other things like real estate and other tangible assets.” Even BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has gone on record alleging that all assets should be tokenized on a blockchain and tradable online, writing in his 2025 annual shareholder letter: “Every stock, every bond, every fund — every asset — can be tokenized.” See also: Regulators Rewrite How Blockchain Gets Built At the same time, the elephant in the room as it relates to tokenization of equities is the fact that there exists no federal policy framework in the U.S. regulating this emerging asset class. Tokenized equities were among the key reasons why cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase withdrew its support for the Senate Banking Committee’s draft of a market structure bill for digital assets, with the company’s CEO believing that the bill’s text included a “de facto ban” on tokenized equities. But the NYSE’s own decision to move forward with its tokenized securities initiative underscores a broader transformation: tokenization may soon shift from niche experiment to systemic feature of global capital markets, if regulatory approval allows. For CFOs, success will derive from balancing innovation with governance, shaping strategic initiatives that integrate tokenized equities without compromising compliance or market integrity. Global regulatory fragmentation also poses a challenge. While U.S. regulators pursue frameworks under the SEC’s aegis, other jurisdictions may implement divergent rules from permissive regimes to outright prohibitions on token trading, potentially forcing multinationals to adopt segmented strategies tailored to each jurisdiction’s legal environment.

Title: Multiple States Follow Texas in Launching Bitcoin Reserve Initiatives
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2026/01/19/multiple-states-follow-texas-in-launching-bitcoin-reserve-initiatives/
Time Published: 2026-01-19T18:06:33Z

Texas has become the first American state to acquire bitcoin for its public treasury, setting off a nationwide competition as other states rush to establish their own cryptocurrency strategic reserves. CNBC reports that Texas has made history by becoming the first state to purchase bitcoin as part of its public investment strategy, launching what experts are calling a “Reserve Race” among states seeking to position themselves at the forefront of digital asset adoption. The move comes as numerous states across different political alignments pursue legislation to bring cryptocurrencies onto their public balance sheets. The Texas crypto purchase involved approximately five million dollars invested in the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust, one of the largest bitcoin exchange-traded funds that has accumulated over seventy-two billion dollars in assets under management since its January 2024 launch. The state comptroller’s office executed the transaction on November 20, 2025, when bitcoin was trading at approximately ninety-one thousand three hundred thirty-six dollars per coin. With bitcoin trading above ninety-five thousand dollars as of recently, the investment has already shown modest gains. This purchase represents only half of the ten million dollars Texas has allocated for its Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. State officials have characterized this initial ETF investment as a placeholder measure while they develop the necessary security infrastructure and storage protocols for holding actual bitcoin directly. The legislative framework for the reserve was established through a 2024 law that authorized the state comptroller to hold cryptocurrency. New Hampshire actually preceded Texas in passing crypto strategic reserve legislation, enacting its law last May. The New Hampshire law grants the state treasurer authority to invest up to five percent of state funds in cryptocurrency ETFs, though the authorization also extends to precious metals including gold. Arizona has passed similar legislation, while Massachusetts, Ohio, and South Dakota all have cryptocurrency reserve bills at various stages of committee review and legislative consideration. The trend toward state-level cryptocurrency adoption is not strictly following partisan political lines, despite much of the legislation being primarily sponsored or co-sponsored by Republican lawmakers. The cryptocurrency industry emerged as a major political force during the 2024 election cycle, becoming the largest corporate donor and providing support to candidates from both major parties. The industry is already accumulating resources for the 2026 midterm elections. Justin Marlowe, a public policy professor at the University of Chicago, views the state-level initiatives primarily as signaling mechanisms at this stage. According to Marlowe, governors seeking to demonstrate openness to innovative business development in the digital economy find these cryptocurrency measures to be relatively low-cost and low-risk ways to communicate that message. This explains why political leaders across the ideological spectrum and throughout different geographic regions have taken concrete steps in this direction. In states taking more substantial steps, including Texas, Arizona, and Florida, Marlowe noted that acknowledging the growing political influence of cryptocurrency advocates has played a significant role in advancing these initiatives. Common elements across state cryptocurrency initiatives include authorizing state treasurers or other investment officials to allocate limited amounts of public funds to crypto investments and establishing governance structures necessary for managing cryptocurrency holdings. These governance frameworks often involve more frequent reporting requirements and stronger custodial agreements compared to traditional asset classes. The funding sources for these reserves vary, with some states using cash while others utilize government-seized cryptocurrency, similar to the federal approach. President Donald Trump signed an executive order in March to create a strategic bitcoin reserve at the federal level, though the authorization was limited to seized cryptocurrency to demonstrate that taxpayers would bear no direct financial burden from the initiative. Texas’s emergence as the first state to fund a crypto reserve follows logically from its established position as a cryptocurrency hub, particularly in bitcoin mining operations. The state’s combination of affordable and flexible power infrastructure, along with a generally pro-cryptocurrency political environment, has positioned Texas as a significant player in both the national and global bitcoin mining market in recent years. Beyond strategic reserves, states are integrating cryptocurrency into core financial and budgeting functions. New Hampshire became the first state to approve a bitcoin-backed municipal bond issuance last November. The proposed one hundred million dollar issuance would represent the first time cryptocurrency serves as collateral in the U.S. municipal bond market. While the transaction has not yet occurred, plans call for completion this year. Read more at CNBC here.

Title: Inequality and unease are rising as elite Davos event opens with pro-business Trump set to attend

By JAMEY KEATEN DAVOS, Switzerland (AP) — Corporate chiefs and government leaders including U.S. President Donald Trump swarm into Davos, Switzerland, this week, joining an elite annual meeting that promotes dialogue and economic progress — even as a domineering tone from Washington has upended the global order and billionaires have reaped trillions in new wealth as the poor lag behind. The World Economic Forum, the think tank whose four-day annual meeting opens Tuesday, has a stated motto of “improving the state of the world,” and this year’s theme is “A spirit of dialogue.” One question is whether Trump will speak with attendees — or at them. Nearly 3,000 attendees from the interlinked worlds of business, advocacy and policy will tackle issues including the growing gap between rich and poor; AI’s impact on jobs; concerns about geo-economic conflict; tariffs that have rocked longstanding trade relationships; and an erosion of trust between communities and countries. “It’s really going to be a discussion at a very important moment … geopolitics is changing,” said Mirek Dušek, a forum managing director in charge of programming. “Some people think we’re in a transition. Some people think we’ve already entered a new era. But I think it’s undeniable that you are seeing a more competitive, more contested landscape.” Trump’s third visit to Davos as president comes as U.S. allies worry about his ambition to take over Greenland, Latin America is grappling with his efforts to reap Venezuela’s oil, and his hardball tactics toward Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell have stirred concern among business leaders and lawmakers alike. Trump’s peace-making credentials also will be on the table: An announcement looms about his “ Board of Peace ” for Gaza, and he and his administration are expected to have bilateral meetings in the warren of side rooms at the Congress Center. The U.S. leader seems to revel in strolling through the Davos Congress Center and among executives who back his business-minded, money-making approach to politics. Critics will also be nearby: He’s blown hot and cold recently with Colombian President Gustavo Petro, an invitee; Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi of Iran, whose leaders face U.S. sanctions over their handling of recent protests, was set to speak but organizers on Monday canceled his appearance, saying “the tragic loss of civilian lives” means “it is not right” for the government to be represented. The two likeliest counterweights to Trump’s administration on the international scene — China and the European Union — get top billing on the first day: EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will speak Tuesday morning, right before Vice Premier He Lifeng, China’s “economic czar” — as Dušek put it. The forum will be without its founder, Klaus Schwab, who hosted the first event in Davos 55 years ago focusing on business, only to see it since balloon into a catchall extravaganza. He stepped down in April. New co-chairs Larry Fink, the head of investment firm BlackRock, and Andre Hoffman, vice chair of pharmaceuticals firm Roche, are in charge. This year will also mark the debut appearance of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, arguably the world’s most important tech leader today, among some 850 CEOs and chairs of global companies – along with celebrities like Hollywood actor and safe-water advocate Matt Damon. The future of AI, its impact on business and work, and the prospects for artificial general intelligence will be key themes. The presidents of Argentina, France, Indonesia, Syria and Ukraine will be among the dozens of national leaders on hand. Leading public-relations firm Edelman reports in its annual trust barometer – launched a quarter-century ago and this year surveying nearly 34,000 people in 28 countries – that trade and recession fears have climbed to an all-time high, optimism is falling especially in developed countries, and “grievance” last year has morphed into broader “insularity.” “People are retreating from dialogue and compromise, choosing the safety of the familiar over the perceived risk of change,” said CEO Richard Edelman. “We favor nationalism over global connection and individual gain over joint progress. Our mentality has shifted from ‘we’ to ‘me’.” The survey found that about two-thirds of respondents said their trust was concentrated toward CEOs of the companies that they work for, fellow citizens or neighbors, while nearly 70% believed institutional leaders — such as from business or government — deliberately mislead the public. Oxfam, the world-renowned advocacy group, issued a report which showed that billionaire wealth rose by more than 16% last year, three times faster than the past five-year average, to more than $18 trillion. It drew on Forbes magazine data on the world’s richest people. Oxfam said the $2.5 trillion rise in the wealth of billionaires last year would be enough to eradicate extreme poverty 26 times over. Their wealth has risen by more than four-fifths since 2020, while nearly half the world’s population lives in poverty, the group said. The Trump administration has led a “pro-billionaire agenda,” the group said, through actions such as slashing taxes for the wealthiest, fostering the growth of AI-related stocks that help rich investors get richer, and thwarting efforts to tax giant companies. The advocacy group wants more national efforts to reduce inequality, higher taxes on the ultra-rich to reduce their power, and greater limits on their ability to shape policy through lobbying. With such concerns filtering through to policymakers, Trump, who is leading the biggest-ever U.S. delegation and will have about a half-dozen Cabinet secretaries in tow, is expected to discuss housing and affordability in his Davos speech on Wednesday. As usual, protesters rallied over the weekend in and near Davos ahead of the event. Hundreds of marchers scaled an Alpine road up to the town on Saturday behind a banner in German that read “No Profit from War” and alongside a truck that bore a sign: World Economic Failure. Companies like Microsoft, India’s Tata Consultancy, social media titan TikTok and cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike joined governments from countries like Nigeria, Qatar, Ukraine and the United States — a USA House is making a debut this year — to set up shop on the Davos Promenade to promote their services, products and national economies. Davos storekeepers rent out their premises so that forum participants can have the prime real estate for the week. Critics have long accused the annual meeting of generating more rhetoric than results, and they see Trump’s return as sign of the disconnect between haves and have-nots. Some say Swiss leaders who support the event and flock to Davos too are adding to the problem. “It is worrying how Swiss politicians are courting warmongers and their profiteers in Davos,” said Mirjam Hostetmann, president of Switzerland’s Young Socialists, who have led protests against the event. “The WEF will never bring peace, but will only fuel escalation.” AP World Economic Forum: https://apnews.com/hub/world-economic-forum

"We favor nationalism over global connection and individual gain over joint progress. Our mentality has shifted from 'we' to 'me'." The survey found that about two-thirds of respondents said their trust was concentrated toward CEOs of the companies that they work for, fellow citizens or neighbors, while nearly 70% believed institutional leaders — such as from business or government — deliberately mislead the public. WATCH: Jamie Dimon on how economic inequality fueled political polarization and what can be done Oxfam, the world-renowned advocacy group, issued a report which showed that billionaire wealth rose by more than 16% last year, three times faster than the past five-year average, to more than $18 trillion. It drew on Forbes magazine data on the world's richest people. Oxfam said the $2.5 trillion rise in the wealth of billionaires last year would be enough to eradicate extreme poverty 26 times over. Their wealth has risen by more than four-fifths since 2020, while nearly half the world's population lives in poverty, the group said. The Trump administration has led a "pro-billionaire agenda," the group said, through actions such as slashing taxes for the wealthiest, fostering the growth of AI-related stocks that help rich investors get richer, and thwarting efforts to tax giant companies. The advocacy group wants more national efforts to reduce inequality, higher taxes on the ultra-rich to reduce their power, and greater limits on their ability to shape policy through lobbying. With such concerns filtering through to policymakers, Trump, who is leading the biggest-ever U.S. delegation and will have about a half-dozen Cabinet secretaries in tow, is expected to discuss housing and affordability in his Davos speech on Wednesday. As usual, protesters rallied over the weekend in and near Davos ahead of the event. Hundreds of marchers scaled an Alpine road up to the town on Saturday behind a banner in German that read "No Profit from War" and alongside a truck that bore a sign: World Economic Failure. Companies like Microsoft, India's Tata Consultancy, social media titan TikTok and cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike joined governments from countries such as Nigeria, Qatar, Ukraine and the United States — a USA House is making a debut this year — to set up shop on the Davos Promenade to promote their services, products and national economies. Davos storekeepers rent out their premises so that forum participants can have the prime real estate for the week. Critics have long accused the annual meeting of generating more rhetoric than results, and they see Trump's return as sign of the disconnect between haves and have-nots. Some say Swiss leaders who support the event and flock to Davos too are adding to the problem. "It is worrying how Swiss politicians are courting warmongers and their profiteers in Davos," said Mirjam Hostetmann, president of Switzerland's Young Socialists, who have led protests against the event. "The WEF will never bring peace, but will only fuel escalation." Support trusted journalism and civil dialogue.

Title: Here Lies the Liberal World Order: 1945-2025

Time Published: 2026-01-19T14:45:07Z

Back in 1989, renowned political scientist Francis Fukuyama got a little bit over his skis, as they say, when he enthusiastically welcomed in a new (and emphatically final) geopolitical epoch, audaciously dubbed the “End of History.” To read this article in the following languages, click the Translate Website button below the author’s name. Русский, Español, 中文, Portugues, Français, عربي, Hebrew, Deutsch, Farsi, Italiano, 日本語, 한국어, Türkçe, Српски. And 40 more languages. From “The End of History?,” 1989: “The twentieth century saw the developed world descend into a paroxysm of ideological violence, as liberalism contended first with the remnants of absolutism, then bolshevism and fascism, and finally an updated Marxism that threatened to lead to the ultimate apocalypse of nuclear war. But the century that began full of self-confidence in the ultimate triumph of Western liberal democracy seems at its close to be returning full circle to where it started: not to an “end of ideology” or a convergence between capitalism and socialism, as earlier predicted, but to an unabashed victory of economic and political liberalism. The triumph of the West, of the Western idea, is evident first of all in the total exhaustion of viable systematic alternatives to Western liberalism. In the past decade, there have been unmistakable changes in the intellectual climate of the world’s two largest communist countries, and the beginnings of significant reform movements in both. But this phenomenon extends beyond high politics and it can be seen also in the ineluctable spread of consumerist Western culture in such diverse contexts as the peasants’ markets and color television sets now omnipresent throughout China, the cooperative restaurants and clothing stores opened in the past year in Moscow, the Beethoven piped into Japanese department stores, and the rock music enjoyed alike in Prague, Rangoon, and Tehran. What we may be witnessing is not just the end of the Cold War, or the passing of a particular period of postwar history, but the end of history as such: that is, the end point of mankind’s ideological evolution and the universalization of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human government.” Liberalism today, liberalism tomorrow, liberalism forever! to paraphrase notorious Alabama segregationist George Wallace. In chronological context, it was an understandable misapprehension that afflicted Fukuyama and clouded his crystal ball; in 1989, getting high on the liberal order supply was easy. No serious ideological rivals to liberalism existed any longer at the international level; the liberal order, with the United States at the head, exercised global hegemony; everybody the world over wanted a pair of blue jeans and a Chevy Corvette and a hot blonde on their arm and all of the glorious excesses of liberal capitalism. Alas, the utopian “End of History,” ironically, didn’t last long; by 2026, universalist liberalism has now reached what very much looks like the end of the line a mere three and a half decades since Fukuyama declared it the “final form of human government.” So-called “international law,” which underpins the global liberal order, has always been heavier on the aspiration and lighter on the actual, existing in a nether-region between theory and practicality, applied and adhered to erratically and arbitrarily — with no consequences for those who violate it, provided they have the military power to thwart attempts at accountability. Lots of examples abound, but a prime one, which has received relatively little attention with the heavy media focus on Latin America and the Middle East, was Xi Jinping announcing in his New Year’s address that the forced “reunification” of Taiwan into the budding Sino Empire is “unstoppable” — a barely veiled flouting of the international powers that would threaten to oppose such a move militarily. (I predict China will pull the trigger on the kinetic invasion before the end of the year if it can’t submit Taiwan through economic or political pressure under threat of military action — the latter approach it would prefer for reasons of optics and because Taiwan is ethnically Chinese, likely tempering the bloodlust as the Chinese view the Taiwanese as their kin.) While China has long signaled its intent to reclaim Taiwan, which it lost in the middle of the last century as the last stronghold of the nationalists fighting the CCP, Xi would not have offered such direct talk just a year ago. Yet, inch by inch, as the liberal order loses its grip on geopolitics, with it goes the diplomatic imperative to couch rhetoric in terms in keeping with international law. In the same vein, Trump has more or less openly admitted that the political, economic and, military pressure applied to Venezuela, including the capture of its president, is about regional hegemony and natural resources: “We are going to have our very large United States oil companies go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken oil infrastructure and start making money for the country,” he said. The Western hemisphere “belongs to us,” the mantra has gone of late. (“Us” meaning, ostensibly, the United States and the citizens thereof, although I don’t feel it belongs to me as an American citizen quite as much as it will soon belong to Blackrock, Palantir, and Chevron.) In a way, the Venezuela rhetoric is much more honest than the obviously insincere 2003-era talk of delivering “democracy” to Iraq, Afghanistan, et al. Those countries were never going to adopt “democracy” even if the United States government insisted on it — which, despite the nonstop lip service, it didn’t anyway because it didn’t care much for constitutional republicanism at home, let alone abroad. Nonetheless, liberal etiquette required the lie to maintain the façade that the world runs on democratic values. So what will replace international liberalism? Something, probably, on the order of multipolar realism — again, much less idealistic yet much more honest in a world that hitherto has functioned on pretty lies. Via Independent Institute (emphasis added): “Realism is one of the prominent international relations theories for explaining the behavior of states. The core essence of realism is an attempt to explain “world politics as they really are, rather than describe how they ought to be,” presenting the world as a state of anarchy where nations, acting as unitary rational actors, compete with each other to maximize their power, “the only—variable of interest.” Realism is often juxtaposed with liberalism, the belief that the “national characteristics of individual States matter for their international relations” and that it is possible for different types of regimes to operate in different ways, such as Kant’s theory of democratic peace. Liberal “institutionalism,” the ideology on which diplomats in the West are brought up, is the belief that “international institutions facilitate cooperation and peace among countries.” The difference between these schools of thought can be understood through their perspectives on international institutions. While liberals assume that organizations like the United Nations are a genuine platform for international cooperation, realists assume that these institutions do very little to prevent states from pursuing their interests and can very often serve as a vector through which state interests are pursued.” * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: Monsters of the Deep

Minneapolis, the sucking chest wound on America’s body politic, gets a break this week from Gawda’mighty, who is turning the heat down to subzero so that ICE-Watch nose-rings can hole-up in their Soros-paid motels, play League of Legends with their DoorDashed Chick-fil-A nuggets, and rest up for the next inning of their motley revolution. ICE itself might even have to lay off its daily round-up of rapists, cut-throats, and child-molesters, to wait out the cold-snap. Meanwhile, things elsewhere roughen up a little. For instance: Davos, Switzerland, where the World Economic Forum (WEF) holds its annual jamboree of vampire squids. Klaus Schwab is out, by the way. He skulked off in a malodorous cloud of embezzlement and sexual irregularities, to be replaced by Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, the hedge fund that owns everything in the USA and wants more. Larry Fink is living proof of the banality of evil, an early pioneer of mortgage-backed securities, which nearly blew up the global banking system in 2008-09, after which he pioneered the wholesale purchasing of foreclosed houses by hedge funds. Neat trick. Cornered the market on all the inventory, so, now, nobody under age-fifty in America can afford to buy a house — but you can rent one from BlackRock! Larry Fink landed as interim head of the WEF largely because BlackRock has been espousing Klaus Schwab’s ideas about “Stakeholder Capitalism,” which allows global corporations to pretend that they have beneficent “societal purpose” while they go about ass-raping the common folk of Western Civ. Climate change and green new deals top that agenda, along with diversity, equity, and inclusion and additional bullshit about “environment, social, and governance factors” (ESG) in its global strategies portfolio — meaning, mandates for exactly the kind of policies that are destroying Europe’s economies, de-industrialization foremost. Clusterfuck Nation is a reader-supported publication. Subscribe to this blog on Patreon or right here on Substack! This blog is sponsored this week by Vaulted, an online mobile web app for investing in allocated and deliverable physical gold. To learn more visit: Vaulted.com Among the invited speakers at Davos this year: one US President Donald Trump. He is going to kill them with kindness, a tongue-bath of Trumpian compliments — you are the greatest. . . beautiful leaders like the world has never seen before — while he artfully inserts a stiletto in the WEF’s liver. You might not even know that the org is a walking corpse until a few weeks after the Davos meeting shuts down. But Mr. Trump is going to terminate its influence and send a message that the era of globalist shenanigans is over. The president can point to two demonstration projects. First, the USA’s acquisition of Greenland one way or another, either ownership or some leasing agreement or revised treaty arrangement. You can be sure that the EU does not like that — big bully America picking on cuddly little Denmark, “the world’s happiest country.” But since they are happily oblivious to Greenland’s strategic importance (vis-a-vis China’s nefarious ambitions there) it is up to America to prepare the game-board. The art of the deal, of course, is making it fait accompli before the targeted property-owner has even entered the discussion. How that works will be a painful discovery for the walking dead Davosanistas. The second demo will be how the recent arrest of Nicolás Maduro leads to revelations of the globalist conspiracy to interfere in elections here, there, and everywhere. Señor Maduro sold his Smartmatic system to all comers, and you can bet that the plea bargain talks are already underway in Brooklyn (if not already concluded). Yes, it is our old friend, the Kraken, which is a related species of giant squid to the vampire variety convened in Davos. This election fraud business is really consequential. It redounds to the criminality of the Democratic Party that had the impudence to jam an enfeebled marionette, “Joe Biden,” into the Oval Office, allowing a treasonous cabal of nihilists to nearly wreck the country. The massive evidence of that crime was clumsily suppressed by the cabal and its allies in the news business. But it is surfacing again, now with Señor Maduro’s imprimatur, and it will turn into a force five storm off the coast of Florida as grand juries in Fort Pierce and Fort Lauderdale were empaneled a week ago to consider the myriad lawless operations mounted against Mr. Trump since 2015, including election fraud. The lawless are going to be rounded up, from Raffensperger in Georgia, to Katie Hobbs in Arizona, to Jocelyn Benson in Michigan, to Jena Griswold in Colorado, to dozens of other officials who were in on the big vote switcheroo of Nov. 3, 2020. And when the revelations finally come, it will be too much for the foot-dragging villains in the US Senate to continue resisting — they will have to pass the SAVE Act or some legislation like it that requires voter ID, one election day, and paper ballots counted by humans, not machines. It remains to be seen whether the Democratic Party goes extinct because of its exposed, widespread criminality, or because it simply can’t win an election without massive ballot fraud.

A call for unity and grace from the mountains high, to the wave crashed coasts: "The person down the street who votes differently than you is not your enemy. They are your neighbor. They worry about the same things you worry about. They want their kids to be safe and their bills to be paid and their country to be a place worth living in. They have been manipulated just like you have been manipulated, fed a different flavor of the same poison, sorted into a different tribe by the same algorithm, pointed at you as the enemy by the same people who point you at them. The working class Republican and the working class Democrat have more in common with each other than either of them has with the billionaire class that funds both parties. You share the same struggles. You face the same rigged systems. You are being crushed by the same economic forces that have transferred more wealth upward in the last fifty years than at any point in human history. And instead of uniting against the people doing this to you, you are screaming at each other on the internet about pronouns and flags and whatever fresh outrage the algorithm served up this morning. This is exactly what they want. A nation at war with itself cannot resist a takeover. A people consumed by mutual hatred will accept any authority that promises to protect them from the manufactured enemy. Every empire that fell was divided before it was conquered. Every free people who lost their freedom were set against each other first. The red versus blue war is not real. It is a show put on by people who own both teams. It is professional wrestling and you think it is a real fight. The wrestlers go backstage after the match and laugh together while you are still screaming at the guy in the other section who was rooting for the wrong character. This Is Our Country Not Theirs This nation belongs to the people who live here and work here and raise families here and will be buried here. It does not belong to billionaires who hold citizenship in three countries and will flee to their bunkers the moment things get bad. It does not belong to tech oligarchs who view democracy as an obstacle to efficiency. It does not belong to foreign interests who have purchased so much influence that they might as well be writing our laws themselves. We have to stop letting them divide us. We have to start seeing each other as fellow Americans again instead of enemy combatants in a culture war that was manufactured to keep us weak. We have to remember that the person screaming at us online is also a victim of the same manipulation, and maybe if we stopped screaming back and started talking, we might realize we have been fighting the wrong enemy this entire time. Turn off the television. It is not informing you. It is programming you. Question everything, including the sources you trust, especially the sources you trust. Talk to people who disagree with you and do it without trying to win. Listen to why they believe what they believe. You might discover that the monster you have been told to hate is actually just another person trying to make sense of a confusing world with imperfect information, exactly like you. Remember who you are. You are an American. Your ancestors came to this land or were brought to this land or were already on this land, and regardless of how they got here, they built something together that was supposed to be different from the old world’s tyrannies and aristocracies. That project is not finished. Every generation has to fight to keep it alive against the forces that want to drag us back to a world where a handful of rulers own everything and everyone else serves at their pleasure. Stop letting them divide you. Your enemies are not your neighbors. Your enemies are the people who profit from your division and are building machines to replace you the moment you are no longer useful. Start acting like it before it is too late". —The Wise Wolf "We must learn to live together as brothers, or we will perish together as fools."

Title: Inequality and unease are rising as elite Davos event opens with pro-business Trump set to attend

The Swiss town of Davos hosts the annual meeting of elites from business, government and culture this week DAVOS, Switzerland -- Corporate chiefs and government leaders including U.S. President Donald Trump swarm into Davos, Switzerland, this week, joining an elite annual meeting that promotes dialogue and economic progress — even as a domineering tone from Washington has upended the global order and billionaires have reaped trillions in new wealth as the poor lag behind. The World Economic Forum, the think tank whose four-day annual meeting opens Tuesday, has a stated motto of “improving the state of the world," and this year's theme is “A spirit of dialogue.” One question is whether Trump will speak with attendees — or at them. Nearly 3,000 attendees from the interlinked worlds of business, advocacy and policy will tackle issues including the growing gap between rich and poor; AI's impact on jobs; concerns about geo-economic conflict; tariffs that have rocked longstanding trade relationships; and an erosion of trust between communities and countries. “It’s really going to be a discussion at a very important moment ... geopolitics is changing," said Mirek Dušek, a forum managing director in charge of programming. "Some people think we’re in a transition. Some people think we’ve already entered a new era. But I think it’s undeniable that you are seeing a more competitive, more contested landscape.” Trump’s third visit to Davos as president comes as U.S. allies worry about his ambition to take over Greenland, Latin America is grappling with his efforts to reap Venezuela’s oil, and his hardball tactics toward Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell have stirred concern among business leaders and lawmakers alike. Trump’s peace-making credentials also will be on the table: An announcement looms about his “ Board of Peace ” for Gaza, and he and his administration are expected to have bilateral meetings in the warren of side rooms at the Congress Center. The U.S. leader seems to revel in strolling through the Davos Congress Center and among executives who back his business-minded, money-making approach to politics. Critics will also be nearby. Trump has blown hot and cold recently with Colombian President Gustavo Petro, an invitee. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi of Iran was set to speak, but his appearance was cancelled. Iran's leaders face U.S. sanctions over their handling of recent protests, and organizers said Monday that "the tragic loss of civilian lives" means “it is not right” for the government to be represented. The two likeliest counterweights to Trump’s administration on the international scene — China and the European Union — get top billing on the first day: EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will speak Tuesday morning, right before Vice Premier He Lifeng, China’s “economic czar” — as Dušek put it. The forum will be without its founder, Klaus Schwab, who hosted the first event in Davos 55 years ago focusing on business, only to see it since balloon into a catchall extravaganza. He stepped down in April. New co-chairs Larry Fink, the head of investment firm BlackRock, and Andre Hoffman, vice chair of pharmaceuticals firm Roche, are in charge. This year will also mark the debut appearance of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, arguably the world’s most important tech leader today, among some 850 CEOs and chairs of global companies — along with celebrities like Hollywood actor and safe-water advocate Matt Damon. The future of AI, its impact on business and work, and the prospects for artificial general intelligence will be key themes. The presidents of Argentina, France, Indonesia, Syria and Ukraine will be among the dozens of national leaders on hand. Leading public-relations firm Edelman reports in its annual trust barometer – launched a quarter-century ago and this year surveying nearly 34,000 people in 28 countries – that trade and recession fears have climbed to an all-time high, optimism is falling especially in developed countries, and “grievance” last year has morphed into broader “insularity.” “People are retreating from dialogue and compromise, choosing the safety of the familiar over the perceived risk of change,” said CEO Richard Edelman. “We favor nationalism over global connection and individual gain over joint progress. Our mentality has shifted from ‘we’ to ‘me’.” The survey found that about two-thirds of respondents said their trust was concentrated toward CEOs of the companies that they work for, fellow citizens or neighbors, while nearly 70% believed institutional leaders — such as from business or government — deliberately mislead the public. Oxfam, the world-renowned advocacy group, issued a report which showed that billionaire wealth rose by more than 16% last year, three times faster than the past five-year average, to more than $18 trillion. It drew on Forbes magazine data on the world’s richest people. Oxfam said the $2.5 trillion rise in the wealth of billionaires last year would be enough to eradicate extreme poverty 26 times over. Their wealth has risen by more than four-fifths since 2020, while nearly half the world’s population lives in poverty, the group said. The Trump administration has led a “pro-billionaire agenda,” the group said, through actions such as slashing taxes for the wealthiest, fostering the growth of AI-related stocks that help rich investors get richer, and thwarting efforts to tax giant companies. The advocacy group wants more national efforts to reduce inequality, higher taxes on the ultra-rich to reduce their power, and greater limits on their ability to shape policy through lobbying. With such concerns filtering through to policymakers, Trump, who is leading the biggest-ever U.S. delegation and will have about a half-dozen Cabinet secretaries in tow, is expected to discuss housing and affordability in his Davos speech on Wednesday.

(AP Photo/Markus Schreiber) DAVOS, Switzerland (AP) — Corporate chiefs and government leaders including U.S. President Donald Trump swarm into Davos, Switzerland, this week, joining an elite annual meeting that promotes dialogue and economic progress — even as a domineering tone from Washington has upended the global order and billionaires have reaped trillions in new wealth as the poor lag behind. The World Economic Forum, the think tank whose four-day annual meeting opens Tuesday, has a stated motto of “improving the state of the world,” and this year’s theme is “A spirit of dialogue.” One question is whether Trump will speak with attendees — or at them. Nearly 3,000 attendees from the interlinked worlds of business, advocacy and policy will tackle issues including the growing gap between rich and poor; AI’s impact on jobs; concerns about geo-economic conflict; tariffs that have rocked longstanding trade relationships; and an erosion of trust between communities and countries. “It’s really going to be a discussion at a very important moment ... geopolitics is changing,” said Mirek Dušek, a forum managing director in charge of programming. “Some people think we’re in a transition. Some people think we’ve already entered a new era. But I think it’s undeniable that you are seeing a more competitive, more contested landscape.” Trump’s third visit to Davos as president comes as U.S. allies worry about his ambition to take over Greenland, Latin America is grappling with his efforts to reap Venezuela’s oil, and his hardball tactics toward Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell have stirred concern among business leaders and lawmakers alike. Trump’s peace-making credentials also will be on the table: An announcement looms about his “ Board of Peace ” for Gaza, and he and his administration are expected to have bilateral meetings in the warren of side rooms at the Congress Center. The U.S. leader seems to revel in strolling through the Davos Congress Center and among executives who back his business-minded, money-making approach to politics. Critics will also be nearby. Trump has blown hot and cold recently with Colombian President Gustavo Petro, an invitee. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi of Iran was set to speak, but his appearance was cancelled. Iran’s leaders face U.S. sanctions over their handling of recent protests, and organizers said Monday that “the tragic loss of civilian lives” means “it is not right” for the government to be represented. The two likeliest counterweights to Trump’s administration on the international scene — China and the European Union — get top billing on the first day: EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will speak Tuesday morning, right before Vice Premier He Lifeng, China’s “economic czar” — as Dušek put it. The forum will be without its founder, Klaus Schwab, who hosted the first event in Davos 55 years ago focusing on business, only to see it since balloon into a catchall extravaganza. He stepped down in April. New co-chairs Larry Fink, the head of investment firm BlackRock, and Andre Hoffman, vice chair of pharmaceuticals firm Roche, are in charge. This year will also mark the debut appearance of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, arguably the world’s most important tech leader today, among some 850 CEOs and chairs of global companies — along with celebrities like Hollywood actor and safe-water advocate Matt Damon. The future of AI, its impact on business and work, and the prospects for artificial general intelligence will be key themes. The presidents of Argentina, France, Indonesia, Syria and Ukraine will be among the dozens of national leaders on hand. Leading public-relations firm Edelman reports in its annual trust barometer – launched a quarter-century ago and this year surveying nearly 34,000 people in 28 countries – that trade and recession fears have climbed to an all-time high, optimism is falling especially in developed countries, and “grievance” last year has morphed into broader “insularity.” “People are retreating from dialogue and compromise, choosing the safety of the familiar over the perceived risk of change,” said CEO Richard Edelman. “We favor nationalism over global connection and individual gain over joint progress. Our mentality has shifted from ‘we’ to ‘me’.” The survey found that about two-thirds of respondents said their trust was concentrated toward CEOs of the companies that they work for, fellow citizens or neighbors, while nearly 70% believed institutional leaders — such as from business or government — deliberately mislead the public. Oxfam, the world-renowned advocacy group, issued a report which showed that billionaire wealth rose by more than 16% last year, three times faster than the past five-year average, to more than $18 trillion. It drew on Forbes magazine data on the world’s richest people. Oxfam said the $2.5 trillion rise in the wealth of billionaires last year would be enough to eradicate extreme poverty 26 times over. Their wealth has risen by more than four-fifths since 2020, while nearly half the world’s population lives in poverty, the group said. The Trump administration has led a “pro-billionaire agenda,” the group said, through actions such as slashing taxes for the wealthiest, fostering the growth of AI-related stocks that help rich investors get richer, and thwarting efforts to tax giant companies. The advocacy group wants more national efforts to reduce inequality, higher taxes on the ultra-rich to reduce their power, and greater limits on their ability to shape policy through lobbying. With such concerns filtering through to policymakers, Trump, who is leading the biggest-ever U.S. delegation and will have about a half-dozen Cabinet secretaries in tow, is expected to discuss housing and affordability in his Davos speech on Wednesday. As usual, protesters rallied over the weekend in and near Davos ahead of the event. Hundreds of marchers scaled an Alpine road up to the town on Saturday behind a banner in German that read “No Profit from War” and alongside a truck that bore a sign: World Economic Failure.

Title: Fresh bagels in the polls, the rise of New Democracy, the finding about PASOK and President Maria, a napalm bomb in Lavrio (EAS), a Greek billionaire who is not a shipowner

Greetings, fresh pretzels in the polls, since today M.M. is also receiving its own survey on what has been happening in public opinion over the past week. So, New Democracy (ND) has a significant recovery compared to December—around 1.5%–2%, always including the extrapolations—which is mainly due to pensioners and public-sector employees who saw the first increase “after the budget–Pierrakakis measures” in pensions and salaries. The conclusion of the farmers’ issue also played a role, in the sense that the subsidies that were pending in December were paid, and at that time ND’s dip had appeared among respondents who are farmers and livestock breeders. Let me be clear, so we don’t exaggerate, that this one-and-a-half to maybe two points, more or less, is nothing shocking or “celebratory” for the governing party, but one way or another it “shows something,” according to the source who gave me the report: “What’s important is that our needle moves depending on the period and the events,” he told me. ND λοιπόν, according to this poll and always with the extrapolations, is at around 30%–30.5%, but the interesting part is what’s happening below that, where we have upheavals. Three existing parties—the PASOK, Velopoulos, and Zoe—are very close to one another, within the margin of statistical error, while Karystianou is clearly measured in second place at 15%, and Tsipras slightly below President Maria. Let me clarify that you will not see an “official percentage” for a party that has not been announced, from any regular polling company. Therefore, formally, PASOK will appear second with a slight difference from Zoe and Velos. SYRIZA is in the doldrums and Latinopoulou is quite pressured at the threshold; the KKE is also at its lows. The new surprise finding– From this survey, part of which you will certainly see within the week, what struck me is that for the first time a distinct shift is recorded from potential PASOK voters to ND—a small but distinct percentage, I repeat. I asked my source how he explains it, and he told me that “there is a serious centrist crowd that sees the circus going on in the opposition with President Maria and Tsipras, Zoe and Velopoulos, and thinks about what is going to happen in the future. They imagine Karystianou negotiating with Erdoğan… and PASOK pays the price,” he told me with a smile, while of course clarifying that we are making conjectures based on polls that are conducted every month, while we are 16 months away from the elections. The modest ceremony comes to an end…– Today K.M. is receiving the leaders of the farmers and has taken care to make it clear in every tone that there is no extra money, since improvements to the package initially announced have already been granted. The agricultural union leaders may put on heroic airs, but they have no desire to remain at the roadblocks after two months. What is needed, therefore, is a little… “cheese” in the so-called “technical” issues, in order to give them an excuse to exit. And even if they decide to play tough after the meeting, Mitsotakis will not concern himself further, given that society has already taken its eyes off the mobilizations. And, as he also says in his public statements, there are other social groups as well. Mitsotakis – ExxonMobil in Davos against the backdrop of hydrocarbon exploration– On the same panel as the head of ExxonMobil, Darren Woods, in a discussion on how Europe can escape stagnation, the prime minister will sit next Thursday as part of the World Economic Forum in Davos. The session, titled “Europe Is Treading Water, How Can It Make Waves?”, brings to the same table politicians, bankers, and top executives of the global economy. Along with the Greek prime minister will participate Irish Taoiseach Micheál Martin, the president of the European Investment Bank Nadia Calviño, and Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing. This is a panel that captures the intersection of political power, financing, and business decisions, at a time when Europe is seeking ways to restart productivity and growth. The discussion takes place during a period in which European productivity remains stagnant, with key obstacles being the investment gap and high energy costs, as also highlighted in the Draghi Report. At the center is the role of investments in energy—alongside the green transition—as a factor in strengthening Europe’s competitiveness and energy security. However, the presence of the head of ExxonMobil gives the discussion an additional, informal but substantial dimension for Greece. The American company is a key international player—along with Chevron—in the concessions west and southwest of Crete, while it has expanded its presence in the country with its participation in Block 2 of the Ionian Sea. These are areas that, if the estimates are confirmed, could alter Greece’s energy map and strengthen its role in the Eastern Mediterranean. It is no coincidence that just in November, ExxonMobil vice president John Ardill, speaking from Athens, placed the decision for an exploratory drilling as early as 2026, with the prospect of implementation in 2027 and the start of natural gas production, if everything proceeds smoothly, in the early 2030s. In Block 2 of the Ionian Sea, a carbonate rock reservoir has already been identified at a depth of about 4,000 meters below sea level, with a potential deposit estimated at 200 billion cubic meters of natural gas. Management of the concession during the exploration period is held by Energean. The coming months are considered critical, as they will determine whether the existing timelines will turn into binding decisions. “Brake” on insurance premiums– In recent days I wrote to you about Theodorikakos’s message to insurance companies—who were heading toward increases of up to 15% in health insurance premiums—to hold back. In fact, a related meeting had taken place, and it appears that the gentlemen’s agreement will be honored by the insurers, who are indeed oriented toward increases, but at single-digit levels, as happened last year as well, taking inflation figures into account. The market is free, of course, but it cannot be unrestrained. Crowds at the Presidential Mansion– After Karamanlis visited the Presidency last Wednesday, Tasoulas is expecting K.M., who will carry out his monthly briefing to the President of the Republic next Tuesday. And the following day, Wednesday, Tasoulas’s meeting with George Papandreou is scheduled. Tasoulas generally seeks to find a counterbalance to polarization, speaking also with former prime ministers. Contact has already been made with Antonis Samaras and Alexis Tsipras, who in the coming days will finalize their meetings with the President of the Republic. President Maria – Down Town– Over the past weekend, Karystianou’s interview in Down Town magazine, which circulated with Fileleftheros of Cyprus, was widely read; the cover with the retouched photo of the president was commented on, as was her dress, which resembles Versace, etc., for the needs of the photoshoot. To give my opinion: Karystianou entered politics and gives an interview to a lifestyle magazine—it seems logical to me that she would pose, be made up, and dressed for the cover of such a magazine; otherwise she would have gone to speak to the same news outlet (and not its social insert), to another newspaper, or to a website. That is where she wanted to “go” to speak, and that is where she went, and I don’t think she did it unconsciously—her taste, her choice, and whoever wants to judge her may judge her, since, I repeat, the woman entered politics. Tonia’s party, the PASOK people, and the others– If it weren’t for the two cadres from the Androulakis side—Kostas Tsoukalas and Andreas Spyropoulos—it would have looked more like a “pre-conference” of the internal party opponents of President Nikos in the center of Athens. But Tonia Antoniou’s invitation to a well-known bar was for her name day, and so many people from PASOK responded, regardless of their connection to one or another internal faction. Eyewitnesses, however, say that at Tonia’s party, those who supported Androulakis in the internal elections probably did not exceed the fingers of one hand. On the contrary, from early Saturday evening and until well after midnight, dozens of cadres arrived and departed, who are preparing for a hard political arm-wrestling match with the presidential camp at the March Congress. Among the first to arrive were Haris Doukas with his wife Georgia and his close associates Christos Protopapas and Kostas Pantis, as well as Manolis Christodoulakis with several cadres of the “network” that is “warming up” ahead of the Congress. Pavlos Geroulanos was represented at the party by people from his “circle”; Kostas Skandalidis, Odysseas Konstantinopoulos, Nadia Giannakopoulou, and many others (mainly from Southern Athens, where Antoniou will again be a parliamentary candidate) were also there—and drank a glass of wine with her—as were cadres who left PASOK, went to SYRIZA during the Tsipras era, departed, and now seem to be returning, little by little, such as Thanos Moraitis, Zoe Karkoulia, and Panagiotis Kormas. These things happen too… What does not happen, especially at these green gatherings on whatever occasion, is for the conversation to exclude the “jabs” about the unmoving needle, the “stakes” of the Congress, and the bets on the performance of the Karystianou and Tsipras parties. Are they worried? They are more worried about the “nibbling” of voters by Karystianou in every constituency. The Chinese Embassy in Athens… cut the New Year’s cake– For the first time, after many years of presence in Greece, the Embassy of the People’s Republic of China in Athens decided to… cut a New Year’s cake last Friday! At a time when President Trump is exerting suffocating pressure on Europe with new tariffs, while all European leaders have officially announced visits to Beijing “to strengthen Sino-European political and economic relations,” Ambassador Fang Qiu decided to honor our country’s customs and cut a New Year’s cake. Fang Qiu has never missed an opportunity to speak about the “new era of cooperation between Greece and China,” with an emphasis on trade, Piraeus as a logistics hub, the green transition, and the maritime economy. It came as no surprise that well-known Greek shipowners (Tsakos, Prokopiou, Palios, etc.) and businesspeople honored the event with their presence. The presence of the political leadership was also discreet, with Giorgos Tragakis—who is, after all, president of the Greek-Chinese Friendship Association—the former Minister of Foreign Affairs Dimitris Avramopoulos, and the former President of the Republic Prokopis Pavlopoulos also in attendance. Napalm bombs in Lavrio?– The night before last, a massive fire broke out at liquid fuel storage tanks in Perama, and the authorities fought a huge, almost all-night battle, ultimately managing to extinguish it without any loss of life. All’s well that ends well—these things happen, and often the damage cannot be foreseen. But in the similar case of Lavrio, where an entire, fully operational powder magazine—the tank facilities of Hellenic Defense Systems—has remained active for years, what is happening? What will happen if the EAS tanks, filled with flammable and toxic chemical substances, explode—like napalm bombs—next to residential areas of Lavrio? There, too, as there was with the trains and the fatal Contract 717, as there is at airports with a tender that has been stuck since 2019 (and the FIR blackout occurred a few days ago), there is a tender to clean the Lavrio tanks—and along with it, the risk of the “holocaust” of an entire urban area. But it gets stuck somewhere, like everything else—guess where… It is an issue solely for Dendias, so let him look into it, so we don’t have any dramas. National Bank: Entry into Saudi Arabia and restart of bancassurance– National Bank is moving toward opening up to the markets of the Arab countries and is already running the relevant procedures. In this context, Andreas Kalis from Olayan Financing Company has joined the National Bank team as Chief Executive Officer for the Middle East region. National Bank is opening a Representative Office in Saudi Arabia with a focus on international syndicated loans, advisory services, and investment banking. The bank also appears to be seeking other people in this field, such as a head of syndicated loan origination, given that business opportunities are opening up in the region. As for the other front, that of bancassurance, it is considered almost certain that National Bank will announce—together with its 2025 results, expected at the end of February—its plans in insurance through banks. It is estimated that the announcement will concern NN Hellas in relation to health insurance, as well as a stake in the Greek arm of the multinational, along with another agreement concerning the non-life insurance sector. The bank must set up a rather different mechanism from the one currently existing in its network, because while it had the agreement with Ethniki Asfalistiki, the company had its own network of insurance agents running sales, with the bank playing a supporting role. Now sales will be based on the bank’s branches, which must drive sales themselves—a development that requires different organization, trained staff in branches, and strengthening of electronic sales. Why GEK TERNA is flying– Santander is not Jefferies, nor Wood; that is, it is not a brokerage firm. It is one of the largest European banks and, until now, had never dealt with the Greek stock market. It decided to do so now, with its recent 90-page report on GEK TERNA, which set a target price of €49 and sees the bottom of the stock at €30 and the top at €62. It is strange that Santander did not choose, for its debut in the Greek market, a stock from the MSCI Standard that generates large volumes and is more recognizable to analysts and funds. Even stranger is that so many reports have been issued on Greek stocks by reputable houses, but none so far has created such buying panic. GEK TERNA’s share went from €25.5 to €30 in three sessions, and this happened because there was real and strong buying interest. A professional who sees an opportunity in GEK TERNA and wants to accumulate, say, 2 million shares, breaks the order across different brokerages, sets limits, pauses, rotates the order so that it doesn’t appear there is a buyer, etc. In the case of GEK TERNA, someone—or some people—were buying as if there were no tomorrow, because they obviously consider the stock cheap at €30. Yes, indeed, GEK has the big advantage of concessions. This year we will see Egnatia operating, next year the airport, at the end of ’27–early ’28 the casino, around then the VOAK, etc. It is a business that is maturing and promises significant profits, but there does not seem to be any particular reason for haste for anyone who wants to invest. According to another scenario circulating in the market, it is possible that we will see GEK TERNA in the MSCI Standard in the upcoming review. In short, the column concludes that Santander’s report is probably just the tip of the iceberg, which showed the market that something big is happening at GEK TERNA. What it is, how long it will take to materialize, and similar questions—only G. Peristeris has the answers. Komárek “locked in” the U.S. through PrizePicks– A very important piece of Allwyn’s strategy has fallen into place. Karel Komárek’s group completed the acquisition of PrizePicks, the largest daily fantasy sports platform in the U.S., for $1.53 billion. The acquisition of 62.3% of the American company (the initial agreement was announced in September) creates conditions for faster development of new products, optimization of customer experience through data-driven approaches, and strengthening competitiveness in digital entertainment markets in a huge market such as the U.S., and beyond. The addition of PrizePicks to Allwyn’s portfolio is considered pivotal, as in addition to boosting the group’s figures by approximately €270 million, it allows the group to gain a presence in almost every U.S. state. As for the OPAP–Allwyn merger, it is proceeding according to plan, with the next key date being February 9, when the deadline expires for exercising or not the exit right by shareholders who voted against the proposal at the extraordinary general meeting on January 7. As the deadline approaches, estimates are growing that the percentage of dissenters will decrease, since the offered cash consideration of €19.04 per share is gross; off-market transfer rights and the applicable capital gains tax will be deducted from it, and payment will be made within one month of the entry into force of the cross-border conversion, which is calculated to occur by the end of the second quarter. At the same time, Allwyn continues to buy OPAP shares through the Athens Stock Exchange, although the price has declined significantly, to €17.87. The new… billionaire– He did not make the Forbes list, but the Karelia Tobacco Company deserves a mention, as it has entered the billionaires’ club (with a valuation of €1.004 billion). The share closed at €364, matching the historical record it had set in September 2023. It is noted that in the recent review for free-float adequacy, Karelia was granted an extension of six additional months, i.e. until June 30, to improve its free float. Meetings for figures and plans in London– Piraeus Bank announced its financial calendar for 2026 and specified the date on which it will publish its 2025 results. That date is February 26, and around then similar announcements are expected from the other systemic banks. In addition, one week later—specifically on March 5—it will hold an investor briefing event in London titled Capital Markets Day 2026, where the bank’s new strategic plans will be revealed, including a strong focus on “Ethniki Asfalistiki,” among other things. Piraeus Bank is, of course, not the only bank planning a Capital Markets Day in London. Alpha Bank is planning a similar investor day in the second quarter. DEI’s next move in retail– The DEI Group is currently valued on the Athens Stock Exchange at just over €8.5 billion and, based on management and analyst forecasts, the stock’s P/E ratio, using 2026 earnings, is just above 10. The Stassis management is determined to leverage the retail network it acquired with Kotsovolos and is therefore already in advanced talks for the acquisition of the Amoiridis–Savvidis chain. Market sources report that the price DEI is offering is around €60 million. Just nine months after completing the acquisition of “Kotsovolos” (April 2024, €200 million), DEI wants to complete the picture of its strategy to transform the group into an integrated energy ecosystem. Amoiridis–Savvidis S.A., based in Thessaloniki, is the exclusive distributor of Morris, F&U, United, and Miyato General. For the DEI Group, which already owns 97 Kotsovolos stores in Greece and Cyprus, the addition of Amoiridis brings something different: a strong presence in the B2B channel, a distribution network in regional markets, and expansion into the home appliances sector. The strategy is clear: combining electricity with appliances, cross-selling photovoltaics through stores, and, of course, promoting DEH Smart Home solutions. If the information is confirmed, the DEI Group will be the only utility organization in Greece with full vertical integration in electricals—from the power socket to the appliance plugged into it. The smart game of Greek shipowners and how patience turns into gold– In a shipping market that has long been oscillating between extreme conditions, Greek shipowners are discreetly making their presence felt, while the Korean giant Sinokor Maritime steals the spotlight. Sinokor’s stormy move to sign long-term charter agreements in recent weeks for 14 VLCC supertankers is being presented as a game changer. At the same time, the Greek strategy reveals a parallel reality. Major Greek groups are locking in long-term contracts that secure stable income and, perhaps more importantly, preserve bargaining power in a VLCC market that is suddenly heating up. One need only look at the three-year charter of the Maran Mars (300,000 dwt) of Maria Angelicoussis by Aramco Trading at $52,000 per day. This is a targeted, strategic placement by one of the most historic Greek names, securing steady revenues in a market that is now approaching almost $80,000 per day for modern VLCCs. Evalend Shipping of Kriton Lendoudis has also entered the high-risk game in a strategic way, as information says Trafigura is in the process of buying Evalend’s two VLCCs, Serendipity and Hunter (299,936 and 299,940 dwt respectively, built in 2021), at a fixed price of $125 million each. At the same time, Navios’s five-year charter agreement under Angeliki Frangou with Mitsui OSK Lines for the Nave Allegro at $44,000 per day follows the same playbook: Greek-owned ships deliver steady returns. Spectacular moves like Sinokor dominate the headlines, but the Greeks are playing a different, perhaps smarter game. In an era of extreme volatility, their strategy favors stable returns and negotiating power, while others chase impressions. In the corridors of Wall Street, they would call it risk-adjusted alpha. The background to the attacks on Greek-owned ships– In diplomatic circles, the two recent attacks on Greek-owned ships in the Black Sea are not being treated as simple low-intensity incidents, but as targeted actions with a clear power imprint. The prevailing interpretation is that the targets were not chosen at random. After all, other Greek ships have also been targets of terrorist actions, such as in the Red Sea and the Mediterranean. Ships of Greek interests are being selected—that is, ships from a shipping sector that controls approximately 61% of European and 21% of global tonnage. This scale makes Greek-owned shipping a critical link in the global transport chain and, at the same time, an ideal “pressure multiplier.” Behind the scenes, it is estimated that by targeting ships of Greek interests, the aim is to send a message not only to Greece, that the security of maritime trade routes cannot be taken for granted without active political and operational presence. As diplomatic circles point out, attacks of this type have limited military cost but significant political and economic impact. They affect insurance coverage, freight rates, routing choices, and ultimately international energy and trade stability. The same circles note that Greek-owned shipping, because it operates legally and outside sanctions regimes, lends itself to “gray” pressure without immediate international outcry. Athens, according to diplomatic sources, is seeking to use this situation to highlight a long-standing deficit: the absence of a unified maritime security strategy. Contacts at the level of the EU, international organizations, and shipping bodies are no longer limited to recording incidents, but are moving toward joint threat assessment and a possible institutional response. For Greek-owned shipping, what is at stake is not only the safety of its vessels, but its position as a key stabilizing factor in global trade. For this reason, there was an immediate response from the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Shipping with meetings to chart a strategy, as well as an intervention by the Union of Greek Shipowners with a statement-message in all directions. Agapitos brings a vessel to the Saronic Gulf– We wrote about it on Friday as information, but over the weekend sources confirmed that Antonis Agapitos is bringing a second high-speed vessel to double up where Speed Cat I operates under the Alpha Lines flag. The name being heard is “ESCHILLO,” and he plans to bring it under tow from Italy. It was built in 2006. As things appear, interesting developments are coming to the Saronic Gulf in the upcoming tourist season. We shall see. New records on the Stock Exchange– In addition to the GEK TERNA record mentioned above, where the stock reached prices not seen since November 1999, the Athens International Airport (AIA) closed at a new all-time high, with the airport’s share consolidating above €11. New records were also achieved by Viohalco and Cenergy, reaching €12.26 and €17 respectively. On the other hand, Jumbo is trading at a nine-month low, with investors still trying to “digest” the reduction in the target price and the downgrade of the recommendation by Citi. Since the American firm’s report was published, the stock has fallen cumulatively by more than 5%, with the €26 support level now being questioned. The unstoppable banks– Banks are posting one of the strongest starts of recent years on the Athens Stock Exchange, having recorded gains of 14.3% in the first ten sessions of 2026. Eurobank is moving at highs of more than ten years, heading full speed toward €4 for the first time since early November 2015. Piraeus Bank broke through the “fortress” of €8 and is trading at levels last seen in March 2021. At the same time, Piraeus Bank became the fourth listed company with an 11-digit valuation, after Coca-Cola HBC, National Bank, and Eurobank, as its market capitalization now approaches €10 billion. How cheap the Athens Stock Exchange is– And since we mentioned the records at the ASE above, worldperatio.com (or World PE Ratio) is a specialized website that tracks and publishes Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratios of stock markets worldwide. It evaluates markets across different time frames (5, 10, 20 years) and categorizes them as “Fair,” “Overvalued,” “Expensive,” and “Undervalued.” In the latest table published by worldperatio.com, the New Zealand Stock Exchange flirts with a P/E of 30.04 and the U.S., at 27.07, is characterized as “expensive” across all time horizons. The Greek Stock Exchange, despite five consecutive bullish years, appears impressively cheap on a relative valuation basis. With a capitalization of €154.3 billion and P/E ratios among blue chips below 10, the Greek market is still trading at price levels that would be considered “fair,” even compared with also-labeled “fair” India (P/E 24.11). The Swiss Stock Exchange, with a P/E of 23.62, is considered overvalued on a five-year basis, while Australia, at 21.23, is considered “expensive.” In Greece, the banking sector, with its incredible triple-digit performance, offers ROE above 15%, good dividend yields, and a single-digit P/E of 8. All this in a period of major turbulence, during which all managers wake up and go to sleep with their “finger on the trigger.” After all, today, with Wall Street closed for Martin Luther King Day, it will be seen how European managers view the Athens Stock Exchange. A familiar Portuguese vice president of the ECB– Today’s Eurogroup meeting, under the presidency of Greek Finance Minister Kyriakos Pierrakakis, is expected to conclude with the name of the new Vice President of the ECB, as the term of Luis de Guindos expires in May. It appears that the vice presidency of the European Central Bank will not leave the Iberian Peninsula. Among the six candidates (Portugal – Mário Centeno, Latvia – Mārtiņš Kazāks, Estonia – Madis Müller, Finland – Olli Rehn, Lithuania – Rimantas Šadžius, Croatia – Boris Vujčić), information converges that the first, former finance minister and governor of Portugal’s central bank, Mário Centeno, has the greatest chances. The Spaniards hold the presidency of the European Investment Bank (EIB), the French for one more year (until 2027) hold the leadership of the ECB—a position much desired by the Dutch with Klaas Knot and also by the Finns with the—very familiar to us—Olli Rehn. Goldman Sachs arms itself (just in case) with a record issuance– Goldman Sachs is laying its cards on the table with $16 billion. It is preparing to issue the largest bond offering in the history of Wall Street. Officially, Goldman Sachs states that it needs the money for liquidity, refinancing existing debt, and general corporate purposes. On the other hand, it is interesting that the “smartest bank on Wall Street” wants to lock in $16 billion at today’s spread levels and is not waiting for the lower interest rates constantly heralded by the POTUS and his associates. The fact is that bond yields in general are currently at high levels, but the credit spreads of banks with “A investment-grade” ratings remain relatively low. At a time when the Trump administration is announcing “deregulation,” Goldman, under Basel III, faces new capital requirements. For some reason—known only to GS analysts and management—the creation of a $16 billion safety buffer today was preferred over waiting until 2027. There is, of course, also the possibility that Goldman needs $16 billion to enter the dance of mergers and acquisitions. A new face as a candidate for Fed chair– Last Thursday, President Trump welcomed the very well-known BlackRock manager Rick Rieder to the White House. Rieder is Chief Investment Officer (CIO) of Global Fixed Income at BlackRock and manages approximately $2.4 trillion in assets. After the White House meeting, it was revealed that RR is one of the four candidates on the final shortlist for the position of Chair of the Federal Reserve, as Jerome Powell’s term ends on May 15, 2025. Also present at Thursday’s meeting were Susie Wiles (chief of staff), Scott Bessent (Secretary of the Treasury), and Dan Scavino (deputy chief of staff). The fact that Trump is considering a top Wall Street executive—from the world’s largest asset management firm—for the leadership of the Fed has once again unsettled New York, which always has as a favorite topic of discussion—how to put it politely—the potential convergence between market interests and the monetary policy the Fed will follow after May.

PHOTO: SUNWAY/FACEBOOK Published Jan 19, 2026, 10:28 AM Updated Jan 19, 2026, 07:11 PM KUALA LUMPUR - Sunway’s proposed RM11 billion (S$3.5 billion) takeover of IJM Corp is drawing political scrutiny over concerns that it could dilute both the equity interests of the government and the rights of Malaysia’s bumiputeras. Dr Akmal Saleh, the youth chief of UMNO, which is a key member of Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim’s ruling coalition, raised concerns over the deal in a Facebook post on Jan 18. The Malay Businessmen and Industrialists Association of Malaysia is also questioning the deal, according to a separate report in Free Malaysia Today. The deal could help Sunway emerge as the largest property and construction conglomerate in Malaysia, UOB Kay Hian has written in a note. But Sunway is largely controlled by Malaysian tycoon Jeffrey Cheah Fook Ling, who is ethnic Chinese, and the criticism underscores the sensitivity of any deal that may affect the interests of bumiputeras, a term that refers to Malays and various indigenous groups. Dr Akmal said bumiputera stakes in major Malaysian corporates are “already limited” and that the deal would reduce that interest if it goes through. He noted that various Malaysian state funds, including Permodalan Nasional and the Employees Provident Fund, which are widely held by bumiputera interests, own a combined 47.1 per cent stake in IJM. Malay Businessmen and Industrialists Association president Azamanizam Baharon urged Datuk Seri Anwar to intervene over what he called a historic policy mistake, according to the Free Malaysia report on Jan 18. Sunway could not immediately be reached for comment. The country’s sovereign fund, Khazanah Nasional, also faced political criticism when it privatised Malaysia Airports Holdings in an equally large privatisation exercise in 2024. That was largely owing to the involvement of BlackRock, whose perceived ties to Israel were unpopular in a Muslim-majority country where pro-Palestine sentiments run high. The Khazanah transaction faced delays as a result, but was finally completed in early 2025. BLOOMBERG E-paper Newsletters Podcasts RSS Feed About Us Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy Need help?

Title: Fed chair race still up in the air
URL: https://www.bostonherald.com/2026/01/18/fed-chair-race-still-up-in-the-air/
Time Published: 2026-01-19T00:23:44Z
Full Content:
White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said President Donald Trump may well keep him in his current job, which would eliminate him from contention for the next Federal Reserve chair. “From the beginning, he and I have talked about whether it’s better for me to be here in the West Wing or over at the Fed,” Hassett said on Fox News’ “The Sunday Briefing.” “I don’t think he’s made a final call on that.” Trump expressed reluctance last week about nominating Hassett as the successor to current Fed Chair Jerome Powell, telling the National Economic Council director during a White House event that “I actually want to keep you where you are, if you want to know the truth.” Hassett once was considered the front-runner, along with Fed Governor Christopher Waller, former governor Kevin Warsh and BlackRock Inc. executive Rick Rieder. It’s now seen as a four-man race, while Rieder’s candidacy has recently gained late momentum, according to people familiar with the matter, as some view him as potentially better placed to win U.S. Senate confirmation. A criminal probe targeting the Federal Reserve and Powell over the remodeling of the central bank’s headquarters injected a new element into the Fed search and sparked a wave of backlash. Powell accused the Justice Department of opening the investigation to pressure the central bank into cutting rates. Key lawmakers, including Senate Banking Committee member Thom Tillis, warned that Trump’s nominees will be scrutinized more closely. Coupled with Trump’s relentless pressure on Powell and the Fed to lower interest rates, the DOJ’s move renewed a broader market focus on the central bank’s autonomy from political interference, though Trump said “I don’t know anything” about the probe. Axios reported on Jan. 12 that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned Trump the investigation had created a mess and could be bad for financial markets. While Bessent declined to comment on the Axios report on NBC’s Meet the Press, he cited Treasury bond auctions last week as evidence that “the market is looking beyond this.” Bond yields fell Tuesday and Wednesday, though the Treasury market was relatively little changed last week. Bessent told NBC he isn’t concerned that the Senate could block Trump’s eventual nominee to helm the Fed. “I think we will move forward,” he said. “I believe that we will probably be hearing from the Banking Committee soon on what they would like to see.” Jerome Powell’s term as head of the central bank ends on May 15. The search process is being led by Bessent, who Trump has said removed himself from consideration for the role. “There are a lot of great candidates, and it could well be that the president’s right to make the decision that this is the best place for me right now,” Hassett said Sunday, referring to the White House.

Title: BlackRock’s Rick Rieder bid for Fed chair is gaining traction
URL: https://fortune.com/2026/01/18/blackrock-rick-rieder-bid-fed-chair-trump-jerome-powell-hassett/

The candidacy of BlackRock’s Rick Rieder to be the next Federal Reserve chair has gained late momentum, people familiar with the matter say, as President Donald Trump weighs congressional blowback in his bid to put a friendlier face at the head of the central bank. Trump’s interview Thursday with Rieder went well, the people said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the private deliberations. Key senators such as Republican Banking Committee member Thom Tillis have warned that Trump’s Fed picks will get more scrutiny after the Justice Department subpoenaed the Fed last week over statements by Chair Jerome Powell related to a renovation project at the bank’s headquarters. But Powell, whose term expires in May, contends the criminal probe is a pretext to punish him for not cutting rates quickly enough. Read More: Fed Served With DOJ Subpoenas; Powell Vows to Stand Firm Trump, asked Friday about the selection process, said he had a candidate in mind, while declining to name him. “I think I have it — in my mind, done,” he said. The search is now a four-man race, some of the people said, among Rieder, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, Fed Governor Christopher Waller and former governor Kevin Warsh, the people said. Read More: The Turbulent Forces Reshaping The Fed This Year Hassett was an early frontrunner and continued to be until Trump said this week he may not want to lose Hassett from his current role. It’s not clear if it was a signal of a shifting internal deliberation, or an offhand remark. “Nobody knows who President Trump will choose for the Fed, except President Trump himself. As the president recently said, he will announce his final decision soon,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a written statement Saturday. The decision to subpoena the Fed a week ago sparked a wave of backlash, including a pledge by Tillis — who sits on the committee that would first consider a nominee — to oppose any Fed nomination until the matter is resolved. Rieder, BlackRock’s chief investment officer of global fixed income, is viewed as potentially easier to confirm, some of the people said. A spokesperson for BlackRock declined to comment on Rieder’s status. Hiring data released earlier this month suggested the labor market remained fragile at the end of the year, and the outlook for hiring is guarded. Economists see another year of limited job opportunities and cooling pay gains, likely exacerbating voters’ affordability concerns going into this year’s midterm elections. Fed officials cut rates three consecutive times at the end of 2025, but have signaled they’re in no rush to lower them again until they see more data on inflation and the labor market. Policymakers are expected to hold rates steady at their next meeting on Jan. 27-28. Rieder has called the Fed’s independence “critical,” but has also echoed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in saying the central bank could be more “innovative” in how it uses its balance sheet.

Title: The world's rich and powerful are descending on Davos — and many are coming by private jet
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/davos-private-jets-rich-powerful-arrive-tracker-2026-1
Time Published: 2026-01-18T15:17:49Z

Private jets are descending on the typically quiet ski town of Davos as the masters of the universe make their way to Switzerland for the World Economic Forum. Bill Gates, Nvidia's Jensen Huang, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon are among the business leaders scheduled to attend, along with world leaders like French President Emmanuel Macron, Argentina's Javier Milei, and Donald Trump. It's unlikely any of these titans will fly commercial. Last year, private aviation traffic in the region during WEF week was about five times the usual level, with more than 150 jets landing at area airports, according to JetSpy, which tracks FAA-registered aircraft. They were registered to billionaires like Michael Dell and Robert Smith, and hailed from Palm Beach and Dubai, Paris, and Doha. This weekend, corporate jets owned by Google, BlackRock, and IBM were among those that arrived in the area, according to data from JetSpy. Few WEF attendees will fly into Engadin Airport, the airport closest to Davos and the highest in Europe by altitude. "For many years, the WEF week has actually been one of the quietest weeks of the winter season for us," Christian Gorfer, the airport's chief financial officer, told Business Insider in an email. Due to airspace restrictions within a 25 nautical mile radius of Davos, all flights to and from Engadin require prior authorisation from the Swiss Air Force. "Some of our regular customers do fly in and out during that week, but WEF participants generally do not make their way to [Engadin]," Gorfer said. Instead, many private jets and government airplanes will arrive at the Zurich Airport alongside regular airlines. It's about a two-hour drive away from the Alpine town, but the wealthiest people will travel by helicopter instead. The airport estimated there will be an extra 1,000 takeoffs and landings during the conference, with some landing after its typically strict curfew of 11:30 p.m. Zurich Airport is also extending the opening hours for an observation deck for planespotters and other aviation enthusiasts. Others fly into Germany's Friedrichshafen Airport, a Jetspy spokesperson told Business Insider. The jets will be a parade of some of the most expensive on the market. Many opt for the Gulfstream G650, which costs tens of millions and was the transport of choice for attendees like Gates, Louis Bacon, and executives from BlackRock and Goldman Sachs last year. Others fly on the Bombardier Global 7500, which has been dubbed the "Ferrari of the Skies." Jump to

Title: The Panama Canal proves one lesson America needs now: never quit

Fox News correspondent Griff Jenkins unpacks which nations have control of the Panama Canal on ‘Special Report.’ I grew up in Windsor Locks, Connecticut. Our town’s name described what made us unique — we had locks on the Connecticut River. Ever since I was a kid, I have understood how locks worked, and I always wanted to see the ones that changed the world. Recently, I had that opportunity when I transited the Panama Canal. To see the locks operate just as they have for more than 110 years was thrilling. Traveling the almost 50-mile journey from the Pacific to the Atlantic was an experience I’ll never forget. The construction of the canal was the largest and most expensive project ever undertaken at that point in human history. Nothing so massive, elaborate or systematic had ever been attempted before. The financial cost, combined with the human toll of more than 25,000 lives lost, was comparable to a war. BLACKROCK INKS $23B DEAL FOR PANAMA CANAL PORTS Such a monumental achievement could never have happened without determination, perseverance, persistence and grit. The result changed the world and the global economy forever. The canal cut the distance from the Atlantic to the Pacific by 8,000 miles, resulting in three fewer weeks of travel time. Today, ships carrying as many as 11,000 containers transit through the canal. Cars, appliances and an array of other goods make their way across the world thanks to the more than 13,000 to 14,000 ships that use the Panama Canal each year. But the journey to a mid-continental canal was a long one, filled with crushed dreams, financial ruin, enormous adversity — and ultimate triumph. The French were the first to attempt building the canal. Ferdinand de Lesseps had built the Suez Canal and was certain he could build the Panama Canal too. The French created a private company to do it. They sold shares in multiple rounds of investment. Huge sums of money were raised and spent. After almost a decade of work, they quit and accepted defeat. Ferdinand de Lesseps insisted on a sea-level canal instead of one with locks, even though the two oceans have different sea levels, with tides rising 20 feet on the Pacific side but only three feet on the Atlantic. That decision was the single greatest factor in the project’s failure. BUILDING THE PANAMA CANAL: HOW TEDDY ROOSEVELT’S ALL-AMERICAN VISION MADE HISTORY More than 20,000 workers died, most from yellow fever and malaria. He would later admit that Panama was 10 times more difficult than Suez. Most unfortunate were the more than 800,000 French men and women who had invested in the project. The savings of entire families were gone. People lost everything. It was the largest and most significant financial collapse on record — a historic failure. Panama Canal lock's gates opening. (Danuta Hamlin) A decade later, America chose to build the Panama Canal. President Theodore Roosevelt asked the U.S. Senate to choose either Panama or Nicaragua for the canal. Even though a Nicaragua canal would be 135 miles longer, require more locks, and be more expensive to operate, it was the favorite. But after 14 days of debate, Panama won by a mere eight votes. America would pursue the seemingly impossible task of building the Panama Canal. It would require cutting through a jungle filled with ferocious animals, snakes and tarantulas — and carving through the sheer rock of the Continental Divide. US, PANAMA ‘TAKING BACK’ CANAL FROM ‘CHINA'S INFLUENCE,’ SAYS HEGSETH Roosevelt tapped John Wallace as chief engineer. He lasted only a year, overwhelmed by the monumental task, a brutal climate and the fear of yellow fever and malaria. John Stevens took over and proposed a lake-and-lock plan. The Panama Canal is not a simple passageway. It uses three locks to lift ships up to travel through the man-made Gatun Lake, then three more locks to lower them back down to another canal. Stevens also tasked chief Army physician William Gorgas with successfully eradicating yellow fever. But Stevens resigned three years later with no explanation.

He brought a military mindset to the work, but the demanding conditions remained. The rainy season lasts eight months in Panama, with 120 inches of annual rainfall, resulting in flooding and mudslides. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Heat and humidity were oppressive. At the bottom of Culebra Cut, the midday temperature was seldom less than 100 degrees — and often reached 120 to 130 degrees. On a typical day, more than 300 rock drills were in use, along with steam shovels and dynamite blasts. The noise was deafening and could be heard for miles. Though yellow fever and malaria were eradicated, death was omnipresent. Men were struck by flying rocks, crushed by machines or blown to bits by dynamite. More than 5,000 men died during the American construction. It was an incredible test of human endurance. But on Aug. 15, 1914, the canal opened for business — miraculously under budget and six months ahead of schedule. It was the culmination of a dream and more than 20 years of phenomenal effort and perseverance. This new year, you can see the impossible become possible in your own life — if you practice the same persistence and determination. As the English preacher Charles Spurgeon once said, "By persistence the snail reached the ark." ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER, ON NEW YEAR'S DAY, SHARES 'THE ONLY THING THAT WORKS' WHEN IT COMES TO ACHIEVING GOALS This could be the year you stick with it — no more quitting or giving up. No more excuses for why it can’t be done or is simply too difficult. The canal went from a dream to reality through grit and determination, through consistent progress in a singular direction. Panama Canal locks. (Danuta Hamlin) Maybe you are disappointed with the pace of your progress or the rate of your accomplishments. You may wish you were further along than you are. It takes time for the work to be done in our lives. It often takes longer than we expect. We can get frustrated at the slow pace of growth and wish for more. But if you have perseverance and endurance, you can see your dream become reality. You may lack money, ability or resources, but a million dollars’ worth of determination will get it done. There may be setbacks this year. Illness strikes. Loss hits. Relationships end. Time and again, in the building of the canal, there were setbacks that required restructuring. You, too, must regroup and continue your journey. Despite the failures, you must choose to persevere through disappointment and pain. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP You can hang on far longer than you think. You may believe you can’t do it anymore. It’s hard. It’s challenging. But so was building the canal — and they overcame. You can too. Sometimes the toughest moment comes right before the breakthrough.

According to the World Economic Forum’s Report released January 2026, the upcoming meeting on the 18th will highlight instability via: Geoeconomic confrontation, state-based armed conflict, extreme weather events, and societal polarization. Economic risks are intensifying and will do so over the next two to ten years. In contrast to White House disinformation, an economic downturn and inflation are top tier. “An economic reckoning explores how, over the next two years, mounting debt sustainability concerns coupled with potential economic bubbles – in a context of rising Geoeconomic confrontation – could herald a new phase of volatility, potentially further destabilizing societies and businesses.” The Ten-Year outlook focuses on extreme weather events, biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse, critical change to earth systems. Magnetic North. The Two-Year outlook focuses mainly on Geoeconomic confrontation, societal polarization and extreme weather events.

Geoeconomic confrontation involves such actions as tariffs, sanctions, weaponization against economic rivals as the triggers which could collapse society. Societal polarization refers to distrust in institutions, extreme societal division, and divergent sets of ‘facts’. Extreme weather could be the result of weather manipulation wherein natural systems are broken down causing extremes. However, the run of magnetic north southward is definitely in play as a natural event. Oddly, Trump is accelerating all the two- and ten-year events with instructions from the Deep State Kabbalah. How will he address these at a podium in Davos will be an interesting insight into the who, what, where and how. The latest addition to ‘mounting debt’ is Trump offering Greenland $700 billion. Without authorization of the Congress, or The People. Unconstitutional. According to Debt Clock, the countries with the lowest debt to GDP include: Russia, Ireland, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Taiwan and Turkey. All within the Eastern Hemisphere. When realizing and analyzing the global actions, the World Economic Forum Agenda, the Trump effect, the overriding question is “WHY?” We are all privy to the reality that this is all contrived. It is not coincidental. Not evolutionary. It is a created failure of the American empire, which will ripple through global economies like a ball barring hitting the Empire State Building! The ’why’ is almost as obscure as asking why don’t humans see the entire color spectrum? Why would God limit our sight and hearing? Why do we exist? Why doesn’t ANY government acknowledge UFO’s? They have been around for thousands of years. Depicted in cave art, the Minoan culture, the Aztecs, etc. In order to know and understand the WHY of the Kabbalah’s design of destruction, we would have to understand their souls, their hearts, their minds – which would likely drive a sane man to insanity. To know them, one would have to become like them. And it appears, Trump has always been a deceiver. JD Vance is considered par to worse than Trump. Graham is their openly evil jester. He speaks what they don’t say and jumps for joy at any chance to murder large swathes of humans. To understand – would mean to be like Graham. Under co-chairs Larry Fink (BlackRock) and Andre Hoffman (la Roche), the World Economic Forum has expanded quite exponentially adding 11 distinct ‘Centres’ to its foray into world domination. These Centres would operate as agencies within the context of the sphere and include cybersecurity, AI, manufacturing, energy, tech, financial & monetary, trade and the crème de la crème – Centre for The New Economy and Society! It is billed as a platform for leaders to build prosperous, resilient and inclusive societies that create opportunities for all. Heavily weighted companies associated with this Centre include the US, UAE, Netherlands, India and the UK. See this. In order to build anew, one must first destroy the entirety of the old. Much like razing Gaza but on a global level. It means a hell of a lot of people will die in order to rearrange the deck chairs. It reads like a blueprint of a monarchy. The leaders and stakeholders will need to assure a viable talented working class to create and build these initiatives because bankers and politicians don’t have skillsets. As such, they are more than willing to task education facilities to ‘re-skill via the “Revolution initiative.” In 1976, the movie Logan’s Run revealed such a society whereby productivity was considered to decline as of the age of 30 – therefore everyone attaining the age of 30 must commit their duty to be gassed – voluntarily. I see this sort of energy in the WEF’s new website Initiative for the New Economy and Society. This will be accomplished thru the Initiative — The Global Gender Parity Sprint. Without this initiative, it will take 123 years to close the gender gap. Acceleration is necessary. The means? * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

U.S. President Donald Trump will attend the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual gathering in Davos, Switzerland, this week as he continues to challenge the established world order with a series of geopolitical victories and the promise of more to come. Since returning to the White House the president has withdrawn from numerous wasteful and unaccountable international organizations, including the U.N. climate treaty, captured Venezuela’s socialist dictator Nicolas Maduro following an attack on the capital Caracas and is now looking to annex Greenland. He has also challenged members of the NATO alliance to step up and start paying their way without relying so much on U.S. taxpayer dollars. Trump will be joined this year by more than 60 heads of state and government at the snowy confab of corporate and cultural elites. Among them are Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, Argentinian President Javier Milei, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, China’s Vice Premier He Lifeng, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Israeli President Isaac Herzog, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Syrian leader Ahmad al-Sharaa. DW reports Trump is leading the largest U.S. delegation ever to Davos, comprising five cabinet secretaries and other senior officials. Final preparations are underway in Davos as the town gets ready to welcome guests for the World Economic Forum on January 17, 2026 in Switzerland. The annual meeting brings together leaders from government, business and civil society to discuss major global issues. (Elena Romanova/Getty) The delegation includes Secretary of State Marco Rubio, special envoy Steve ​Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, setting the stage for high-profile discussions on Ukraine, Venezuela, Gaza and Iran, where eyewitnesses have reported a brutal crackdown on anti-government protests, DW notes before continuing: Trump is expected to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Kyiv’s G7 allies — including leaders from Germany, Italy, France, the UK, Canada and the European Commission president — on the sidelines of the main event to seek US backing for security guarantees for Ukraine after a possible peace agreement with Russia, the Financial Times reported. The strong U.S. presence would be complemented by the first-ever “USA House” — a venue housed in a small church on the town’s main Promenade street, where US officials will host events and network with investors. Added to the list is California Governor Gavin Newsom, a determined Trump foe slated to speak one day after the president’s address. “Trump’s economic agenda betrays our nation: it is not ‘America First’ but ‘Trump First’ — rewarding the favored, punishing the dissenters, and burdening the rest,” Newsom said in a statement as reported by Politico. “At the World Economic Forum, I will forcefully confront these abuses and resolutely defend the principles to which California owes its economic strength: disciplined governance, world-leading universities, boundless innovation, and an open embrace of global cultures. This year’s meeting would be the first without WEF founder Klaus Schwab at the helm after he stepped down last year. Schwab has been succeeded by interim co-chairs Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, and Andre Hoffmann, vice chair of Swiss pharmaceuticals company Roche Holdings. President Trump will front the gathering in person on Wednesday after last year making his address remotely via via videostream. Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.

Title: More than 600 gardaí injured in line of duty last year
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/ireland/2026/0118/1553724-garda-injuries/
Time Published: 2026-01-18T12:01:21Z

More than 600 gardaí were injured in the line of duty last year with more than half sustaining an injury as a result of an assault. New figures released under Freedom of Information legislation show that the number of gardaí injured at work during 2025 rose by 11% compared to the previous year. A total of 616 officers were recorded reporting some form of work-related injury last year - up from 555 in 2024. The figures include 344 gardaí who sustained injuries as the result of an assault - 56% of all injuries incurred in the line of duty. Among high-profile incidents in which gardaí were assaulted during the year were riots outside the Citywest complex in Saggart, Co Dublin in October as well as three separate incidents over a weekend in Dungarvan, Co Waterford in the same month when seven gardaí were injured. The second most common source of injury for gardaí in 2025 after assault were injuries from slips, trips and/or falls which resulted in injuries to 87 officers, followed by road traffic collisions which injured 78 gardaí. The figures show 41 gardaí suffered injuries like sprains or broken bones as a result of what is classified as "body movement", while 17 gardaí were injured from some form of contact with an animal including dog bites. Another 24 were injured from contact with something either sharp, rough or pointed and another ten suffered either a needle stick injury, a stab wound or exposure to a body fluid. The figures also reveal that 16 gardaí sustained injuries while based at the Garda College in Templemore, Co Tipperary, with approximately two-thirds of incidents at the training facility associated with slips, trips or falls. Another 15 injuries were reported among staff working at Garda HQ in Phoenix Park in Dublin. A total of eight members of the Garda Special Tactics and Operations Command were injured during 2025 including three who were assaulted. The overall level of injuries equates to around 4% of the 14,200-plus available force suffering some type of harm in the course of their work in 2025 – or one in every 25 gardaí. However, the rate can vary significantly around the country with 7% of gardaí in three garda divisions - Galway, Kerry and Wexford/Wicklow - being injured at work last year. The most number of gardaí injured in the line of duty in any of the 21 garda divisions last year was Galway with 43 out of a total workforce of 616, including 36 members who were assaulted. In contrast, the injury rate was as low as 2% in the Dublin East region, which covers areas including Blackrock, Dún Laoghaire and Dundrum, where just seven out of 377 gardaí reported a work-related injury. The Kerry division with a smaller workforce of 348 recorded more than three times that number with 25 officers being injured on duty - although the figure was a decrease on the 41 gardaí injured in Kerry in 2024. On taking up his appointment last September, Garda Commissioner Justin Kelly said the safety of gardaí was "of utmost importance and concern" for An Garda Síochána. Mr Kelly subsequently authorised the introduction of tasers for frontline gardaí on a pilot basis while the wearing of body cameras is to be unrolled nationwide among frontline staff too as measures aimed at reducing the level of injuries to gardaí. In November 2023, the government increased the maximum sentence for assaulting or threatening to assault a garda or any other on-duty emergency worker from seven to 12 years. © RTÉ 2026.

Title: Climate funding: Why PSUs are stepping in where VCs fear to tread

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. New Delhi: Neiox Eco Cycle isn’t the sort of startup you read about every day. It isn’t solving for fashion, food or grocery delivery. Rather, it is in the business of ship hulls—specifically, it is developing carbon-negative, non-toxic marine coatings for the undersides of marine vessels. There is nothing sexy about the business, which has to solve for plankton, barnacles, mussels and other such delights. It’s also not the sort of business that attracts much interest from venture capitalists (VCs), who generally prefer to focus on consumer-facing or software-as-a-service (SaaS) businesses. Despite this, Neiox Eco Cycle, founded by Akhil Raj Pottekkat, was able to obtain a tiny amount of funding in November 2024. The money didn’t come from a VC, but from Cochin Shipyard, which invested ₹30 lakh in the Kerala-based climate-tech startup. Last October, the shipbuilder followed that up with an additional ₹75 lakh investment under its maritime innovation programme. Neiox isn’t the only startup to receive backing from an unlikely investor. In November, Mahanagar Gas Ltd (MGL) invested ₹120 crore in Bengaluru-based electric vehicle (EV) startup 3ev, which builds electric cargo vehicles and battery infrastructure, for a 30.97% stake. That same month, Varaha, a climate-tech startup, received an infusion of $30.5 million from Mirova, the sustainable investing arm of French financial group Natixis. Other examples include Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL) backing early-stage climate technologies through its Udgam innovation platform, including a ₹35-crore investment in Maraal Aerospace, which builds long-range solar-powered drones, and Oil India Ltd backing carbon and materials innovation through investments in startups such as Caliche and Carbonation India in 2025. These investments may appear disparate and unrelated on the surface. But together, they epitomize a gradual shift in how climate innovation is being funded, driven less by rapid exits and more by patient capital. India’s climate-tech story is increasingly being written by these unlikely financiers—legacy institutions, public sector firms and global capital are stepping in where venture capital has feared to tread. To be sure, these are mostly very small investments. But, like a mustard seed, the investors hope, these infusions, made with an eye on the future, will germinate into something huge. Rather than near-term returns, they are hedging against regulatory risk, future demand shifts and operational disruptions. “The traditional VC model is built for high-risk, hyper-growth businesses, while most climate technologies require patient capital and long gestation periods. That mismatch is why legacy firms, public sector undertakings (PSUs) and global investors are stepping in—they’re investing to hedge transition risk and build relevance, not to chase fast exits," said Rajan Mehta, founder, Climate Ventures Partner. This quiet realignment is unfolding against a paradoxical backdrop. India has seen 642 climate-tech startups founded in the last three years, and 492 have raised funding over that period. Yet only 61 have reached Series B or later, while 678 have shut shop since January 2023, according to data from Tracxn. What lies beneathIn shipping, what keeps a vessel afloat and profitable is often what lies unseen beneath the waterline. The hull—the lower portion of a vessel, which remains submerged—is its most critical and vulnerable component. Constant exposure to seawater and microscopic marine organisms make it prone to corrosion. Unlike engines or other mechanical systems that are routinely overhauled, hull quality largely determines a ship’s long-term value. Vessels are typically taken out of service every five years for dry docking, where hulls are inspected, repaired and repainted. View Full Image Globally, the shipping sector has pledged to reach net-zero greenhouse-gas emissions by around 2050. Current systems require the application of multiple layers—often as many as seven—with separate coatings used to prevent corrosion and to reduce biofouling (accumulation of biowaste such as barnacles on the hull). The accumulation of marine organisms on a ship’s hull increases drag, forcing vessels to burn more fuel to maintain speed, increasing emissions—most vessels still run on highly polluting fuels derived from crude oil. Existing anti-fouling paints by and large rely on biocides that kill marine organisms—an approach increasingly being frowned on by European environmental rules. For shipbuilders and repair yards, coatings are thus an unglamorous but decisive variable, shaping operating economics and emissions over decades. For ship owners, every day that a vessel sits in dock translates into idle time and lost revenue. Globally, marine hull coatings are dominated by a small club of companies such as Jotun, Hempel and Nippon Paint. These multinationals control licensing, class approvals and defence-grade specifications. While some manufacture in India, there is no Indian-origin company with an internationally approved marine coating. That gap is what drew Cochin Shipyard, India’s largest state-run shipbuilder, to back Neiox Eco Cycle. The startup upcycles industrial air pollutants into an advanced additive that can be integrated into marine paint and applied directly to ship hulls. It thus turns waste into a functional input for one of shipping’s most consequential, if least visible, layers, said Neiox’s Pottekkat. View Full Image Akhil Raj Pottekkat, founder, Neiox Eco Cycle. Neiox is positioning itself not just as a domestic alternative, but as a regulation-compliant challenger offering non-toxic, carbon-negative coatings. The company claims its technology collapses the seven-layer coating stack into a single, non-toxic application that tackles both corrosion and biofouling—cutting downtime, fuel loss and environmental risk in one stroke. For Cochin Shipyard, it checks several boxes at once. “Risk-adjusted technology exposure is often the priority (for investors such as Cochin Shipyard): small grants help create an early pipeline of tested solutions that could become relevant to future operations without committing large balance-sheet capital upfront," said Sumanta Biswas, assistant director at CUTS International, a policy research and advocacy group. Compliance with green norms is another imperative for Cochin Shipyard. Globally, the shipping sector has pledged to reach net-zero greenhouse-gas emissions by around 2050 under a revised strategy adopted by the International Maritime Organization, with interim emissions reduction targets set for 2030 and 2040. Beyond gasIn Mumbai, MGL, a stodgy, listed city gas utility. was led by the same rationale to invest in 3ev. The startup offers aftermarket services such as battery-as-a-service (BaaS), where it plans to deploy a bulk of the ₹120 crore funding from MGL, given that batteries are the most critical and fastest-degrading component in commercial EVs, making uptime, replacement and life-cycle management central to fleet economics. During its earnings call for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025-26, MGL’s management struck a careful tone: EVs, it said, are unlikely to dent compressed natural gas (CNG) demand in the near term. Yet, in the same breath, the company acknowledged investments such as 3ev as part of exploring adjacent energy transition opportunities, describing it as a long-term equity bet with limited near-term financial impact. “Mahanagar Gas’s management was actively analysing the transition to electric mobility—what it would mean for gas distribution, transportation demand… It wasn’t just an internal discussion; investors and analysts were asking the same questions," said Peter Voelkner, managing director of 3ev. View Full Image Peter Voelkner, managing director, 3ev. The move marks MGL’s first meaningful step into EV operations, though the company had earlier dipped its toe into e-mobility, including EV charging infrastructure, in collaboration with Tata Power in 2019. More recently, MGL acquired a 44% equity stake in International Battery Company India last February. “MGL’s earlier engagement with Tata Power in 2019 on EV charging infrastructure was part of nascent sector exploration. Its lead investment in 3ev represents a meaningful escalation, transitioning from collaborative pilots to capital commitments in core EV value-chain companies," said Biswas. 3ev is currently piggybacking on MGL’s footprint in Mumbai, with pilot projects placing fast-charging infrastructure at the utility’s CNG filling stations. Beyond Mumbai, the company operates independently in Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai and Coimbatore. The green imperativeIf utilities and shipyards are making cautious, balance-sheet-light bets, global climate capital is moving with a different calculus. International investors and corporates, less constrained by domestic exit timelines, are increasingly backing Indian climate startups tackling longer-cycle problems such as carbon sequestration and regenerative agriculture—areas where traditional venture capital has been slow to commit. While Varaha is one example, other Indian climate-tech startups have also benefited. Arya.ag, which builds farm-gate infrastructure to reduce post-harvest losses, recently raised ₹725 crore in a Series D round led by GEF Capital Partners, a global private equity firm. “Global investors are greening their portfolios. Supporting climate projects in India helps them meet sustainability targets while accessing long-term growth," said Pradeep Singhvi, executive director, energy and climate practice, Grant Thornton Bharat, a management consultancy. Varaha’s model is simple: balance long-cycle carbon bets with faster climate and commercial returns. Flush with more than $42 million in funding, the startup last year struck a deal with Google, which agreed to purchase 100,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide removal credits from the Indian startup. A carbon removal agreement, or carbon purchase agreement (CPA), is a contract by which a company such as Google commits to buying future carbon dioxide removal credits from a supplier such as Varaha. It marked Google’s first carbon-removal agreement tied to a project in India and the largest involving biomass-based biochar—often dubbed “black gold" for soils. Varaha has since followed this up with another agreement with Microsoft last week, making it the tech company’s first carbon removal purchase in Asia. With biochar credits typically priced between $150 and $160 per tonne, a back-of-the-envelope calculation values these deals at roughly $16 million. So far, the New Delhi-based startup is the only Indian company to be listed on carbon removal standard and registry Puro.Earth. Prior to the recent infusion by Mirova, it had received funding from RTP Global, Japan’s Norinchukin Bank, Omnivore and Orios Venture Partners. Yet, interest from venture capital remains thin. Most climate-tech startups that have raised funding in India fall into adaptation-focused products—areas with clearer customers, shorter payback cycles and easier monetisation. Scale remains elusive across much of climate tech. There are around 800 viable climate-tech startups in India, but less than 3% have raised Series B or beyond. “Until carbon markets mature and pricing becomes predictable, many venture investors will remain cautious," said Singhvi. In India, venture capital funding has largely concentrated on EVs and mobility, where risks and timelines are better understood. Since 2022, roughly $6 billion has flowed into startups spanning electric vehicles, battery technology and related transition sectors, producing two mobility unicorns, Ola Electric and Ather Energy. Even so, scale remains elusive across much of climate tech. “There are around 800 viable climate-tech startups in India, but less than 3% have raised Series B or beyond—it’s a serious scaling gap," said Biswas. Large upfront capital needs, long regulatory lead times and dependence on government adoption “keep many VCs wary," he added. “Mitigation demands patient capital; adaptation offers short payback cycles and clearer business models." Total climate-tech funding fell to $657 million in 2025, down from $1.17 billion in 2024 and $1.5 billion in 2023, according to data from Tracxn. The decline has been driven largely by a sharp slowdown in EV mobility funding, which has more than halved since 2023. The contrast is sharper when set against the behaviour of large global financial institutions. In 2021, Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, predicted the emergence of a new generation of climate unicorns—companies built around green hydrogen, agriculture, steel and cement rather than consumer internet. Four years on, that thesis has hardened into investment strategy. Large asset managers increasingly view climate risk as a material financial risk, not an environmental externality. BlackRock, alongside Temasek, has backed companies such as Antora Energy, which develops thermal batteries for industrial decarbonisation, and ConnectDER—signalling how private capital is gravitating toward climate infrastructure and industrial transition plays that sit beyond the comfort zone of traditional venture capital. For shipyards, utilities and global asset managers alike, climate technology is no longer an abstract ESG theme but a hedge against operational, regulatory and market risk. Whether venture capital eventually follows, or is permanently leapfrogged by patient capital with longer horizons, will shape not just how India decarbonises, but who gets to build and own that transition. In shipping, what keeps a vessel afloat and profitable is often what lies unseen beneath the waterline. The hull—the lower portion of a vessel, which remains submerged—is its most critical and vulnerable component. Constant exposure to seawater and microscopic marine organisms make it prone to corrosion. Unlike engines or other mechanical systems that are routinely overhauled, hull quality largely determines a ship’s long-term value. Vessels are typically taken out of service every five years for dry docking, where hulls are inspected, repaired and repainted. Current systems require the application of multiple layers—often as many as seven—with separate coatings used to prevent corrosion and to reduce biofouling (accumulation of biowaste such as barnacles on the hull). The accumulation of marine organisms on a ship’s hull increases drag, forcing vessels to burn more fuel to maintain speed, increasing emissions—most vessels still run on highly polluting fuels derived from crude oil. Existing anti-fouling paints by and large rely on biocides that kill marine organisms—an approach increasingly being frowned on by European environmental rules. For shipbuilders and repair yards, coatings are thus an unglamorous but decisive variable, shaping operating economics and emissions over decades. For ship owners, every day that a vessel sits in dock translates into idle time and lost revenue. Globally, marine hull coatings are dominated by a small club of companies such as Jotun, Hempel and Nippon Paint. These multinationals control licensing, class approvals and defence-grade specifications. While some manufacture in India, there is no Indian-origin company with an internationally approved marine coating. That gap is what drew Cochin Shipyard, India’s largest state-run shipbuilder, to back Neiox Eco Cycle. The startup upcycles industrial air pollutants into an advanced additive that can be integrated into marine paint and applied directly to ship hulls. It thus turns waste into a functional input for one of shipping’s most consequential, if least visible, layers, said Neiox’s Pottekkat. Neiox is positioning itself not just as a domestic alternative, but as a regulation-compliant challenger offering non-toxic, carbon-negative coatings. The company claims its technology collapses the seven-layer coating stack into a single, non-toxic application that tackles both corrosion and biofouling—cutting downtime, fuel loss and environmental risk in one stroke. For Cochin Shipyard, it checks several boxes at once. “Risk-adjusted technology exposure is often the priority (for investors such as Cochin Shipyard): small grants help create an early pipeline of tested solutions that could become relevant to future operations without committing large balance-sheet capital upfront," said Sumanta Biswas, assistant director at CUTS International, a policy research and advocacy group. Compliance with green norms is another imperative for Cochin Shipyard. Globally, the shipping sector has pledged to reach net-zero greenhouse-gas emissions by around 2050 under a revised strategy adopted by the International Maritime Organization, with interim emissions reduction targets set for 2030 and 2040.

The startup offers aftermarket services such as battery-as-a-service (BaaS), where it plans to deploy a bulk of the ₹120 crore funding from MGL, given that batteries are the most critical and fastest-degrading component in commercial EVs, making uptime, replacement and life-cycle management central to fleet economics. During its earnings call for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025-26, MGL’s management struck a careful tone: EVs, it said, are unlikely to dent compressed natural gas (CNG) demand in the near term. Yet, in the same breath, the company acknowledged investments such as 3ev as part of exploring adjacent energy transition opportunities, describing it as a long-term equity bet with limited near-term financial impact. “Mahanagar Gas’s management was actively analysing the transition to electric mobility—what it would mean for gas distribution, transportation demand… It wasn’t just an internal discussion; investors and analysts were asking the same questions," said Peter Voelkner, managing director of 3ev.

The move marks MGL’s first meaningful step into EV operations, though the company had earlier dipped its toe into e-mobility, including EV charging infrastructure, in collaboration with Tata Power in 2019. More recently, MGL acquired a 44% equity stake in International Battery Company India last February. “MGL’s earlier engagement with Tata Power in 2019 on EV charging infrastructure was part of nascent sector exploration. Its lead investment in 3ev represents a meaningful escalation, transitioning from collaborative pilots to capital commitments in core EV value-chain companies," said Biswas. 3ev is currently piggybacking on MGL’s footprint in Mumbai, with pilot projects placing fast-charging infrastructure at the utility’s CNG filling stations. Beyond Mumbai, the company operates independently in Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai and Coimbatore. The green imperativeIf utilities and shipyards are making cautious, balance-sheet-light bets, global climate capital is moving with a different calculus. International investors and corporates, less constrained by domestic exit timelines, are increasingly backing Indian climate startups tackling longer-cycle problems such as carbon sequestration and regenerative agriculture—areas where traditional venture capital has been slow to commit. While Varaha is one example, other Indian climate-tech startups have also benefited. Arya.ag, which builds farm-gate infrastructure to reduce post-harvest losses, recently raised ₹725 crore in a Series D round led by GEF Capital Partners, a global private equity firm. “Global investors are greening their portfolios. Supporting climate projects in India helps them meet sustainability targets while accessing long-term growth," said Pradeep Singhvi, executive director, energy and climate practice, Grant Thornton Bharat, a management consultancy. Varaha’s model is simple: balance long-cycle carbon bets with faster climate and commercial returns. Flush with more than $42 million in funding, the startup last year struck a deal with Google, which agreed to purchase 100,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide removal credits from the Indian startup. A carbon removal agreement, or carbon purchase agreement (CPA), is a contract by which a company such as Google commits to buying future carbon dioxide removal credits from a supplier such as Varaha. It marked Google’s first carbon-removal agreement tied to a project in India and the largest involving biomass-based biochar—often dubbed “black gold" for soils. Varaha has since followed this up with another agreement with Microsoft last week, making it the tech company’s first carbon removal purchase in Asia. With biochar credits typically priced between $150 and $160 per tonne, a back-of-the-envelope calculation values these deals at roughly $16 million. So far, the New Delhi-based startup is the only Indian company to be listed on carbon removal standard and registry Puro.Earth.

Title: Davos invokes spirit of dialogue, despite bleak outlook
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/analysis-and-comment/2026/0118/1553632-davos-world-economic-forum-analysis/
Time Published: 2026-01-18T07:00:02Z

Tony Connelly Europe Editor Donald Trump's inauguration happened slap bang in the middle of last year’s World Economic Forum, his return to the White House both exciting US chief executives and worrying European leaders in equal measure. Addressing Davos invitees by videolink, the US President gave a flavour of what was to come: every global company should invest in America or face tariffs, NATO countries should spend 5% of GDP on defence, Ukraine was ready to do a peace deal, the EU had been ripping off the United States for years thanks to its trade surplus. The bitterest gripe about the EU was that it had thwarted the building of a fence at his golf links in Doonbeg, Co Clare (not true). Twelve months on, that teaser has not done justice to the wrecking ball Mr Trump has taken to global trade, to respect for territorial integrity and to presidential and legal norms. If Davos is the kumbaya citadel of global trade and togetherness, then it should represent everything MAGA hates: yet, Mr Trump is coming, with the biggest ever US delegation, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and special envoy Steve Witkoff. Indeed, the World Economic Forum (WEF) looks like it is having a bumper year like no other, as if the collapse of normal trading relations and a rampant increase in threats to geopolitical stability have forced a displacement to the Swiss Alps out of sheer desperation. "There is historic record participation," says WEF Chief Executive Børge Brende. The truth may be more to do with changes at the top of the WEF hierarchy. For decades, the organisation’s founder Klaus Schwab was the ultimate grandee of the Davos set, cajoling the global elite to make the pilgrimage, and conducting interviews on stage in his gravely and heavily accented voice. Mr Schwab resigned in April last year, following an investigation into WEF’s workplace culture (he was later cleared by the board) and was replaced by Larry Fink, the chair and CEO of the US investment giant BlackRock. Mr Fink has turned out to be the ultimate powerbroker, reportedly singlehandedly convincing President Trump to return to Davos for the first time since 2019. He has managed to invite Jensen Huang, CEO and founder of the leading AI chip manufacturer NVIDIA (market capitalisation $5 trillion) who will make his first appearance. Mr Fink will also personally interview JPMorgan boss Jamie Dimon and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella on stage. Choppering and limo-ing their way to the ski resort will be more than 3,000 participants from 130 countries, including 64 heads of state or government (including six of the G7 leaders, and Taoiseach Micheál Martin), 1,700 business people, including 850 chief executives and chairs of leading companies. "We will have a hard look at Iran, Gaza, Ukraine, and also Latin America, and what we're seeing in Venezuela." There will be 60 ministers of finance, 30 trade ministers, more than 30 foreign ministers, and 15 EU commissioners, including Ireland’s Michael McGrath. The biggest ever delegations from the Gulf, China, Asia and Africa will also be descending on Davos. There will be 150 academics and heads of think-tanks, and 10 Nobel Prize winners. Yet, that sense of can-do collaboration to tackle global problems appears entirely at odds with the zeitgeist. The WEF’s annual global risks survey, published this week, noted that "geoeconomic confrontation" had moved to the top of the list of chief executive concerns, up eight places from last year, with just under a fifth saying economic rivalries were most likely to trigger a crisis this year. Armed conflict between states was ranked as the second-biggest threat (the survey was done before the United States attacked Venezuela, abducting President Maduro, and before Mr Trump declared he would take Greenland "the hard way" if need be). Undeterred, the WEF organisers believe the forum is needed more than ever, even when confronting the most acute crises. "We will have a hard look at Iran, Gaza, Ukraine, and also Latin America, and what we're seeing in Venezuela," Mr Brende told a pre-Davos briefing. While critics of the snowy love-in - with its weird cocktail of thought leaders, spiritual gurus, tech utopians, corporate billionaires, climate activists, trade union leaders and anti-poverty campaigners - question the merits (or even morality) of Davos, its defenders say it offers an unrivalled way of taking big-picture challenges and then throwing power, money and expertise at them. "At the core of the annual meeting programme is the notion that we operate in a new economic reality where geopolitics, exponential innovation, the concepts of economic, societal, environmental resilience are deeply intertwined, and they're also interacting with each other at a rapid clip," says WEF Managing Director Mirek Dušek. "We need to figure out how we are going to trade with each other in the future." Challenges broken down into themes This year’s challenges have been broken down into five themes: how to revive growth, geopolitical threats, AI innovation, how to invest in people and how to build resilience in the sphere of nature, water and climate. The schedule does not shy away from the harsh new realities of Trump world. Under the heading "How can we cooperate in a more contested world?" there are plenty of panel discussions on the threats to global trade, not least when tariffs are weaponised to boost domestic production and as a bargaining chip in great power geopolitics. Oil corporations are now being used as a blunt force weapon by the Trump administration in Venezuela, while sectors such as car-manufacturing, semi-conductors and pharmaceuticals are being more intimately tied to national, or even European Union sovereignty. "The heyday of globalisation is not coming back," The Economist notes in its Davos preview. "The future is likely to hold yet more state involvement. The allure of commercial riches motivated Mr Trump’s toppling of Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela and is guiding his efforts to secure a truce between Russia and Ukraine." Senior WEF figures are nothing if not optimistic (the forum’s slogan remains "Committed to Improving the State of the World", and this year’s theme is "A Spirit of Dialogue"). "We need to figure out how we are going to trade with each other in the future," says Mr Brende. "And we have seen that trade has been pretty resilient. Trade is like water. It finds its way. We collaborate differently than in the past. Is more bespoke, is more plurilateral, all this we will try to figure out in Davos." How or whether that fits in with Donald Trump’s current thinking is hard to say. For him, bespoke means divide and conquer, attempting to peel off the odd EU member state here or there with inducements, threatening other countries with eye-watering tariffs for reasons that have more to do with personal grudges than economic statecraft. His speech in Congress Hall on Wednesday afternoon will be closely watched. Having once again insulted Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky as being the "obstacle" to peace, there is still the chance that he will meet him in Davos (Kyiv has suggested both leaders could finalise a peace plan there). The Taoiseach is expected to hold bilateral meetings with senior political figures, including the Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa, as well as US tech chief executives. Nailing down his precise agenda is proving trickier than usual given the fear among corporate leaders about publicly consorting with non-US leaders in case they incur the wrath of President Trump. Despite that, IDA Ireland says they're expecting between 65 and 70 corporate leaders to attend their annual dinner in the Grischa Hotel on Wednesday evening with Micheál Martin. Last year the guest list tapered off to around 50 once it emerged that the Taoiseach was grounded in Dublin in order to form the new government. Sources suggest that this year there will be a healthy smattering of big names at the dinner, which will also be attended by Michael McGrath and Peter Burke, Minister for Enterprise, Tourism and Employment. WEF organisers, indeed, argue that the start of 2026 finds the global economy in a more resilient shape than had been predicted a year ago. Despite that, global debt and low growth remain stubborn concerns, while geopolitical fragmentation and asset bubbles continue to pose risks. As usual, there will be plenty of speakers cheerleading the potential for AI to boost growth and productivity, while also accelerating progress in scientific and health research, as well as green technology. "We’re hearing from business leaders that when it comes to the opportunity side of things, this goes well beyond artificial intelligence," says Saadia Zahidi, senior managing director of WEF. "There is opportunity when it comes to medical and healthcare services, particularly with changing demographics. There’s opportunity when it comes to advanced manufacturing, especially when that starts blending with Artificial Intelligence." But the big geopolitical crises of our time will be front and centre. European leaders will include Germany’s Friedrich Merz, French President Emmanuel Macron, Spain’s Pedro Sánchez, Finland’s Alexander Stubb, Polish President Karol Nawrocki and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. They are likely to impress upon President Trump the need to rethink his designs on Greenland and instead restore his focus to ending the war in Ukraine. Whether or not he will listen is another matter. Either way, Davos 2026 promises to be the most keenly watched gathering ever. Europe Editor © RTÉ 2026.

Title: Malachy Clerkin: The All-Ireland club finals are precious because they are unique
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/gaelic-games/2026/01/17/malachy-clerkin-the-all-ireland-club-finals-are-precious-because-they-are-unique/
Time Published: 2026-01-17T06:00:01Z
Full Content:
By far the best thing about the club finals is that they’re always unique. The mix always changes and the novelty always keeps the recipe fresh. Big clubs, small clubs, city clubs, parish clubs. Clubs that set out at the start of the year to win the All-Ireland, clubs that weren’t sure last summer if they had the beating of the hoors five miles out the road. On this weekend last year, Na Fianna supporters marched en masse from the closest club to Croke Park to take their seats for their day of days. The walk took no more than 15 minutes, assuming you didn’t get waylaid in Fagan’s halfway down. This time around, Dingle supporters have, if they’re lucky, a nine-hour round trip to make to HQ and back. With traffic, food and pit-stops, it’s probably closer to 11. Two more different clubs you couldn’t fathom. Club finals day makes kings of everyone, regardless. Dingle, from the farthest reaches of the Kerry coast. St Brigid’s from Kiltoom, a sort of sleeper parish on the Roscommon side of Athlone. Loughrea, from deep in Galway hurling country. Ballygunner, on the edge of Waterford city – or maybe that should be Waterford City on the edge of Ballygunner. That’s the foursome for 2025/26 and, like every foursome that has gone before it, it’s unique. This Sunday will see the 55th All-Ireland club hurling final followed by the 55th club football final and in all those years down through a half-century and more, never once has a line-up been duplicated. Plenty of clubs have made it back to Croke Park, some of them in alarmingly short order. But the same four teams have never shared a bill twice. Mostly, this is because repeat fixtures are so rare in either code. Ballyhale have played in more deciders than any other club in hurling or football. Yet in their 11 All-Ireland finals, they have met 11 different opponents. Same goes for Crossmaglen – seven football finals, seven different teams waiting on them when they got there. It does happen occasionally that clubs in the middle of a glorious run find their way back to meet each other. Nemo Rangers played Crossmolina in the 2001 and 2003 finals. In hurling, Birr and Dunloy ran into each other in the final twice in eight years, in 1995 and 2003. Close, but no cigar. Nemo also played two football finals against St Vincents, albeit they were a generation (or three) apart, in 2008 and 1973. And way back when, Blackrock of Cork and St Anne’s of Wexford faced off twice in three years for hurling finals in the early 1970s. But getting the two sides of the house to match up at the same time is all but impossible. There’s never been three clubs on the same bill twice, never mind four. The point is, there’s a recurrent magic to the club finals that is based solely on the fact that this day will almost certainly never happen again. The people of Dingle, Kiltoom, Ballygunner and Loughrea have never descended en masse to Croke Park before and the odds are minuscule that they ever will again. It all adds to the one-off feeling of it all. Down through the decades, 52 different hurling clubs have played in a final, while Dingle are the 54th football club to make it to the dance. In hurling, 28 clubs have been to one final in their history and have never made it back. In football, that number is 29. You better do it this weekend because it’s just so unlikely you’ll ever get the chance again. Little wonder, then, that Loughrea spent time and energy this week successfully appealing Cullen Killeen’s suspension. The Galway club knew two things. One, their only appearance in an All-Ireland final was 19 years ago. Two, Killeen is 19-years-old. This is literally a once-in-a-lifetime game so if there was a way to get him a place in it, they were duty-bound to try and find it. Denis Walsh: The GAA community has no stomach for strict enforcement of rules https://t.co/afv6wIo30s That’s the thing about the club finals. When they’re over, you slide all the way back to the bottom of the board. Neither of last year’s football finalists made it as far as their own county final this time around. Both hurling finalists won their county title but neither survived their first match in the provincial championships. So much has to fall into place for the journey to stay alive all the way to Croke Park. And so, each club lands into the club finals this weekend telling themselves stories that feel entirely their own but which are all really just versions of the same yarn. Here’s St Brigid’s, hellbent on avenging their last-kick defeat of 2024. Here’s Ballygunner, trying to replicate their last-puck win in their only final appearance in 2022. Here’s Loughrea, riding the wave of their first ever back-to-back Galway titles. Here’s Dingle, first-time winners of Munster, first-time All-Ireland finalists. Early on Friday, a clip did the rounds of a news report from 7News in Australia. It showed three of Mark O’Connor’s Geelong teammates pulling wheelie cases through Melbourne airport, on their way to Dublin to see if Dingle can win the All-Ireland club final. A trio of premiership Cats is jetting off to the other side of the globe to watch a teammate chase a lifelong dream. It's reignited calls for the return of the International Rules Series. @cleary_mitch @7AFL pic.twitter.com/WYmEaLbGb4 O’Connor’s just-one-more-boss journey through this club season has been such a glorious story, a poem to the power of love and roots and home. The unique pull of the club finals in action. A precious, precious thing.

Title: 25 ways to get off your screens: from analogue kits to freedom phones
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/life-style/people/2026/01/17/offline-activities-for-2026/
Time Published: 2026-01-17T06:00:00Z

Somewhat ironically, 2026 has been declared by online influencers as the year people will move their lives offline. Videos of people assembling “analogue bags” – essentially holdalls of entertainment to keep boredom at bay – have gone viral on Instagram and TikTok. People are swapping Spotify for radio, Kindles for books, and phone cameras for film. But behind the buzz is a widespread, real-world desire to return to a time before smartphones absorbed hours of every single day, before they were an extension of our bodies. There is a growing sentiment now that the way to thrive in our high-tech world is by living a low-tech life. Social media’s original promise was to enhance our lives and build community, to connect us with other people. Yet research shows the more time people spend on these platforms, the more likely they are to feel depressed and lonely. Australia’s recent ban on under-16s using social media platforms was a world-first policy designed to protect children from harm. It’s not only social media we are giving so much of our downtime to, but online shopping, gaming and random videos of random things. The internet is a never-ending supply of content, and more than 50 per cent of it is now AI generated. It can absorb so much of our attention that we can easily forget just how exciting life can be beyond our little screens. So lock away your phone, log out of Netflix and find inspiration in the ideas below to feed the mind, body and soul. Set yourself up by buying or borrowing a few items that will reduce the practical role of a smartphone in your life. Your lifestyle might require different things, but a good place to start is an alarm clock, so you can keep your phone out of your bedroom; a watch, so you can check the time without checking your phone; and a notebook, so you can jot things down to act on when you’re ready. Most things are a lot less urgent than they seem when the option to respond or act immediately isn’t there. The necessity of emails, maps and internet banking is enough to prevent many of us from making a permanent switch to a “dumb phone” that can’t connect to the internet. There are workarounds, such as removing all non-essential apps from your phone or installing controls to limit screen time. Another option is to procure an old phone, one that doesn’t have internet capabilities,. There are lots of options available for under €50, and you can get a pay-as-you-go SIM. Give the phone number to the people in your life who might need you in an emergency, or who you could call in one. Think of it as your freedom phone, the one in your pocket when you go hiking, or at the bottom of your bag when you go out with friends and just want to see where the day takes you, or when you’re cosied up at home and need a few hours or days of being entirely present with yourself and the people around you. [ No Instagram, Netflix or YouTube: Can I survive a four-week digital detox?Opens in new window ] Technology was supposed to streamline our lives, yet somehow it feels more complicated than ever. We stream music and movies, download books and save thousands of images in the cloud. But do we really own any of these things? If the internet went down, would you have anything to show for years of honing your tastes, curating and collecting? Is there a case for owning actual books, for printing out favourite photos, for finding an old Discman and listening to an album all the way through? The secret to getting back into reading is reading purely for pleasure. Page-turners, characters that stay with you, fiction or non-fiction that is so compelling you bring the book with you wherever you go. Conventionally seen as a solitary way to experience the world, reading can also be a social pursuit. “We have found that community and friendship flourish when phones are put away,” says Maeve O’Brien, co-founder of Silent Book Club Dublin, where people gather once a month in Mish Mash Café on Capel Street to read together. “While it can sometimes be difficult not to check your screen for an hour or two, we have found people start to crave it.” Taking photos with a dedicated camera rather than a phone camera might seem cumbersome, but it offers something different: a chance to slow down, look, engage and create. “Using a ‘real’ camera invites you into a more mindful, observational space where you’re not just capturing life but composing a story and creating art,” says Andrea Hunt, a photographer and tutor with the Dublin Photography School. “Many people are drawn to film photography out of curiosity or a sense of nostalgia. What often keeps them there, then, is the slower, more thoughtful way of working that it encourages. You begin to trust your eye, your understanding of light, and your own patience.” Ditch the notion that board games are only for the festive season, and instead embrace them as part of everyday life, as they have been for thousands of years, from ancient Egypt to ancient Rome. Nine Men’s Morris, a strategic board game, was so beloved by the 13th-century monks on retreat at Glendalough that it was found scratched into a flat piece of slate at the remote Temple-na-Skellig church, which is accessible only by boat. Today, charity shops are often a treasure trove for picking up a nostalgic family classic or discovering a new niche favourite. In an era where you can stream or rent almost any film instantly, going to see a movie on the silver screen retains a certain romantic quality. Cinema’s history in Ireland is storied; James Joyce first introduced cinema to Ireland in 1909 with the Volta Cinematograph Theatre on Dublin’s Mary Street. It was a short-lived venture for the writer, as Dubliners had a fairly muted reaction to his programme of European cinema. Alongside blockbuster cinemas, there are some beautiful independent options around the country with diverse programmes. Consider Dunamaise Arts Centre in Co Laois, The Dot Cinema, a tiny private cinema in Dublin 2, or Triskel Arts Centre in Cork. [ Top travel: the hottest destinations to visit in 2026Opens in new window ] Stitching, knitting, pottery throwing, printing – all manner of arts and crafts offer a chance to create rather than consume, to use your hands for flair and individuality. There is no need for perfection in the end product, but the very making and doing provides an antidote to the passive viewing of algorithmically curated content. “The tactile nature of embroidery makes it such a detox from scrolling,” says Alice Cummins, an embroiderer and tutor of the craft. “The repetitive motion of the needle and thread coming through the fabric. The “in-out-in-out” is almost like meditating. Obviously, you also get a beautiful piece of art out of it, too, but I think most people I know who stitch do it more for the process than the finished product.” One of the hooks that keeps many of us on social media is the promise of connection, with friends, strangers and potential work opportunities. Yet the number of hours spent scrolling in solitude versus the moments of actual fruitful connection does not work in our favour. Instead, try going to one in-person event a month – a talk, a lecture, a concert – and speaking to three people there. It’s fertile ground for real-world connections, based on shared experiences and interests. Learning a new language is arguably one of the most complex mental activities humans can do, but the rewards are great. It has been shown to boost memory, concentration and creativity, as well as improve communication skills and empathy. A recent study published in Nature Aging found that speaking multiple languages can slow brain ageing, the gradual decline in brain processing speed, attention and other cognitive functions. Immersion in the language is the way to maximise these benefits, so stay away from language apps on your phone. Try looking for an in-person class, or if you have a little Irish there’s likely a ciorcal comhrá, an Irish-language conversation group, in your area. As the saying goes, “Is fearr Gaeilge bhriste ná Béarla cliste”. [ Sí, oui, ja! You can learn a language late in lifeOpens in new window ] The extreme heat of a sauna makes it a perilous environment for technology and forces people to leave their phones behind. Fynn Cook, who owns the off-grid Sauna Shack in Co Tyrone, says he often hears phones pinging away in the changing space. “For once, those notifications don’t matter and can be ignored until later.” Without screens or distractions to take people out of the experience, saunas can become micro hubs of connection. “There is something about sharing conversations in a sauna that opens people up, allowing vulnerability and talking openly,” says Cook. [ Nude saunas in Ireland: ‘I realise I will soon be naked among these strangers’Opens in new window ] You don’t have to believe in a doomsday scenario to think it might be worthwhile to know how to look after yourself in the wild with no Google or ChatGPT to ask for help. There are overnight courses around Ireland where you can learn how to make fire from a spark using things such as birch bark, lichen or sap, how to sterilise stream water for drinking, and how to build a shelter. “It’s important for people to have these skills,” says Nathan Kingerlee, who runs Outdoors Ireland’s bushcraft and survival courses in Glengarriff, Co Cork. “Whether it’s for the simple enjoyment and therapeutic value of being able to head outdoors and sit beside your campfire listening to birdsong. Or the ability to survive off-grid for even a week, say in the event of a longer-term power cut or disaster, knowing you can also help and look after those around you.” Growing your own vegetables is a no-brainer if you have any space. It is cost-effective and fosters a deep appreciation of food and connection to the earth. “Any activity that forces you to be out in nature is going to have a positive impact on your mental health,” says Fergus Finlay, from Abercorn Farm in Greystones, Co Wicklow. Abercorn offers day-long courses on how to grow your own vegetables at home. “In a world of instant gratification, growing plants and vegetables is the complete opposite. It takes time, patience and care,” says Finlay. “It forces you to be fully focused on the now and what’s happening in front of you.” Go on a walk without a phone, a watch or music. Gen Z calls this absence of distraction “rawdogging”, and it’s seen as a test of endurance. It doesn’t need to be a punishment, though; it can be a time to connect to your natural surroundings. You could take note of the trees around you, see how many you can identify, and which ones mystify. Maybe learn a new one each day, so that nature is no longer one green and brown blur, but trees you know by name. Niall Mac Coitir’s book Ireland’s Trees: Myths, Legends and Folklore is the perfect accompaniment. Running as a sport is booming, with record numbers signing up for the 2026 Dublin and Cork city marathons. It’s cheap, accessible and delivers a boost of happy hormones as a reward for your efforts. Run alone or join one of the many run clubs around the country, like the Run for Palestine run club, which does a 5km loop every Sunday morning in Dublin. “The pace is very inclusive, enabling runners of all ages and abilities to come along,” says Ola Løkken Nordrum, who founded the group in 2024. “I’ve met so many brave, warm and inspirational people. It has become a space where people can come together and find strength in one another.” Somehow, cooking blogs have become part of the “enshittification” of the internet, the degradation of the online environment. Recipe websites are often so cluttered with ads and pop-ups that you’re constantly scrolling up and down. Cooking a recipe from a cookbook, on the other hand, can bring “comfort and relaxation”, says chef and bestselling author Cherie Denham. “A cookbook comes with heart and soul; a recipe from a Google search does not. I find they bring great comfort and relaxation, particularly at night-time. When I leaf through those pages, and gaze at those photos and read introductions to the recipes, it brings me to a happy place that a computer simply can’t.” [ ‘Stop saying yes’: Over 50 ways you can make your life easier in 2026Opens in new window ] There are just a few environments left in this world that are completely inhospitable to phones. Swimming pools are one of them. For child protection, phones, tablets and any device capable of photography are typically prohibited poolside. In the water, whether you’re floating, paddling or doing laps, there is total freedom from technology and from the outside world. Being in water is a chance to reset and recalibrate. Wild swimming has a similar appeal, a silky, salty release that is hard to find elsewhere. As Bonnie Tsui, the author of Why We Swim, observes, “You don’t have to be a great swimmer to appreciate the benefits of sensory solitude and the equilibrium the water can bring.” “Digital detox”, offgrid stays are on the rise, offering the opportunity for a real break and a real rest. In south Donegal, Lough Mardal Eco Lodge is one such tech and gadget-free zone. On entering, guests leave their devices in lockboxes in the lobby and “find themselves chatting to one another, rather than disappearing into their screens”, says Clare Tindal, who owns and runs Lough Mardal with her husband Marcus Tindal. “The natural environment draws us out of ourselves. You will feel your shoulders drop, your mind declutter and ultimately the immense relief to have separated yourself from your tech devices and their shallow stimulations.” Any practice where you give all of your attention to a single object or activity is a form of meditation. Research has shown that listening to live music during meditation may help focus an active mind, decrease heart rate, anxiety and pain, and guide you to a deeper relaxation. Taking all of this into account, musician Danny Forde created his piano meditation offering. He chooses cosy places in beautiful natural surroundings to play piano for groups, who can lie down and rest. “I like to call it ‘pure listening’, where you practice staying with each note as it’s played, without analysis or judgment,” Forde says. Improvised and beautiful, it is a soothing lullaby in a manic world and can be replicated at home with a CD or RTÉ’s LyricFM. The Artist’s Way is a cult book cum self-help course, passed between friends and creatives for three decades. Written by Julia Cameron, it has been credited by celebrities including Elizabeth Gilbert, Alicia Keys and Reese Witherspoon, alongside millions of others, for helping them rediscover and embrace their individual creative spark. Alongside different weekly exercises, Cameron asks that the first thing you do each morning on waking is write out three pages longhand. These are called Morning Pages. They are private, not to be shown to anyone. “There is no wrong way to do Morning Pages,” Cameron writes in The Artist’s Way, meaning you can write anything you like, nothing is too petty, too banal or too ambitious. It’s a way to start the day fresh, and although Cameron introduced the practice decades before the first smartphone, it can seamlessly replace the morning scroll. Music feeds our soul, and picking up a new instrument or rediscovering one long cast aside can be an entirely absorbing activity and open up many new doors. Rionach O’Callaghan, a retired teacher who took up the ukulele through a term of night classes in Blackrock Further Education in Dublin after the pandemic, says it lifts her spirits being able to play music in a group. “My youngest son played the ukulele when he was very small, and l always thought it sounded like a happy instrument. I played the piano in my youth, but l wanted to play an instrument that was portable and fun. Ukulele is both of these things. Playing it with a group lifts my spirits, and l try never to miss our weekly sessions or the parties.” Our time is the most valuable resource we have, so why not donate it and make a difference? The National Volunteering Database has thousands of varied opportunities across the country to get involved in, depending on your interests. There’s openings to plant native Irish trees with ReWild Wicklow, write letters to people in nursing homes, volunteer at Dublin Zoo, take part in a beach clean-up, become a court and forensic accompaniment volunteer, a driver for autism assistance dogs, or to join the Pachamama project to sew reusable period pads for girls in developing countries so they can stay in school or work. The pull of free-diving, where you dive in open water without oxygen, for many people is the opportunity for silence, to look inside yourself. It may sound extreme, but it’s building a following among swimmers and non-swimmers in Ireland. “It’s like you’re grounded and limitless at the same time,” says Julia Guziuk, who runs Freediving Aran off Inis Mór. “It’s meditation wrapped in adventure, a quiet space where the only ‘noise’ is your own mind and learning to soften that is very powerful.” Divers here can see cliff walls, kelp forests, soft corals, jellyfish and dolphins in this private slice of the Atlantic, which has depths of 20 to 30 metres for beginners to more experienced freedivers. There are more than 450 species of birds on Birdwatch Ireland’s list, and many are rare or unusual or migratory birds. Learning to identify even our most common garden birds deepens every experience of being outside. Hang a bird feeder in your garden or attach a suction feeder to your window and watch the birds come. If you want to level up your twitching, Birdwatch Ireland runs a citizen science survey open to everyone between December and February. By taking part, you can help provide information on how bird populations fare during the harsh winter months each year. One way to put pinging notifications into perspective is to look up, as far as the eye can see and farther still. Stars, planets and the mysteries of the cosmos can make the screens we spend so much time staring into seem dull. Ireland was once a leader in astronomical research, and for seven decades between 1845 and 1914, the observatory at Birr, Co Offaly, had the largest telescope in the world. Birr’s giant “Leviathan” telescope is no longer operational, but there are opportunities to stargaze through super-powerful telescopes at Ireland’s two other historical astronomical observatories at Dunsink Observatory, Dublin and Armagh Observatory, Armagh. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Have you any idea what this colourful fly is?

I spotted this very colourful fly in a garden centre outside Gorey some time ago. Have you any idea what it is? Michael Wade, Co Wexford This is the noonday fly – Mesembrina meridiana – which is most often seen on cow dung, sunbathing on trees, fences and walls in bright sunlight, or visiting flowers to feed on nectar. Eggs are laid in cow dung; the female lays a single egg in up to five cow pats. When they hatch the larvae are carnivorous and feed on other fly larvae within the dung. The female lays up to five eggs in a lifetime, each one in a different pat, at two-day intervals. Ruby (5), Robin (3) and Rossa (1) spotted this unusual looking fungus on a tree in Slieve Gullion Forest while visiting to give Robin’s dodies to the fairies. Robin bravely left her dodies behind, but we were wondering, what is it called and is this a fungus? Ruby, Robin and Rossa Dunworth, Blackrock, Co Louth The fairies may indeed prefer the dodies to this fungus, which is now called jelly ear or wood ear, although the Latin name Auricularia auricula-judae, remains unchanged. The ear-like fruit bodies, up to 9cm across, are tough and gelatinous when young but hard and brittle when dry and old. Larger specimens may have vein-like wrinkles on their surface, making them even more ear-like. The fungus grows on decaying wood of deciduous trees and shrubs but is most usually found on elder trees. It is widespread and common. I got off my bike to take a photo of a cormorant drying off beside the canal at Robert Emmet Bridge, Harold’s Cross. The canal is not perfectly clean but there are regular group clean-ups which help with the water quality. Róisin Sheerin, Dublin It’s hard to take a photo while riding a bike right enough. The Grand Canal has visual litter such as plastics, etc, but the water quality is good. There is enough dissolved oxygen in the water for invertebrates to thrive. These in turn are food for the fish, which are a main part of this cormorant’s diet. It used to be thought that the cormorant was drying its wings when it adopted this pose – even though it might actually be raining at the time – and the cormorant promptly dived back into the water after a short period, getting wet all over again. It is now thought that holding out their wings like this helps them to digest their recently swallowed prey. Our late friend, Mary Shackleton, gave me a present of this tree, which I suspect is unusual. It is now five metres tall and slender stemmed. What is it, please? JC Colgan, Leixlip, Co Kildare It is a poplar, a species of deciduous tree characterised by having long-stalked leaves which tremble in the slightest breeze, thus giving rise to its Irish name – an Crann creathach. This is not the native species Populus tremula (the aspen), however, which has round-toothed leaves. The leaves look more like those of the Black Italian poplar. Only males of this species are known, so see what kind of catkins grow on the tree in due course. We found this bug on the roof of our garage. We wondered, is it a kind of ladybird or another beetle? Emily (12) and Zachary (9) Freedman, Dublin Bugs are listening devices, or germs that give you the flu (unless you are speaking American). This insect is a very young adult seven-spot ladybird just recently emerged from its pupal stage. It emerges yellow and without the spots, which will appear within half a day.

XRP is in the center of crypto conversations, with social interest on X rising to levels that now rival Bitcoin. Recent data tracking the most searched cashtags on the platform shows XRP consistently appearing among the dominant assets drawing user attention. Interestingly, this surge in visibility is not happening in isolation but in tandem with a series of regulatory, institutional, and ecosystem developments within the XRP ecosystem. Data tracking the most-searched cashtags on the social media platform X shows XRP climbing alongside other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, a closer look at the data shows that XRP has received many more cashtags compared to other cryptocurrencies. This trend was revealed by Nikita Bier, head of product at X, who shared a visualization chart of recent search behavior on X. The chart data shows that XRP has consistently appeared among the most queried assets on X since December 2025. Throughout the period depicted, top cashtag traffic has been fluctuating with daily rhythm as X users scan the platform and post on X with cashtags. The share of searches attributable to $xrp slices into a larger portion of the total during days in early January 2026, which indicates extended interest. On some dates, XRP’s presence in the search mix rivals that of $btc and $eth, which are typically the dominant anchors of crypto attention on social media. The chart also shows how other tags wax and wane alongside XRP’s performance. Some days show greater fragmentation, where interest is spread across stocks such as $iren (IREN), $tesla (Tesla), $gme (GameStop), and $asts (AST SpaceMobile Inc.). Nonetheless, the trajectory for XRP in the first half of January shows a growing base of people actively getting involved in the cryptocurrency. Top Cashtags Searched On X Social interest on X is a mix of speculation and ecosystem developments, which XRP is currently sitting at the center of. Behind this spike in attention are tangible developments surrounding Ripple and the XRP ecosystem. One recent example is how Ripple secured regulatory approval from the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority, obtaining both an Electronic Money Institution license and cryptoasset registration. Ripple’s regulatory buildout is expanding across Europe, with additional approvals in Luxembourg as part of its push to operate on both sides of the continent. Interestingly, there are also indications of deeper engagement with Ripple’s ecosystem on the institutional side. Rumors and mentions on X indicate that BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has started to use Ripple’s USD-backed stablecoin (RLUSD) as collateral. However, this move is yet to be confirmed by BlackRock. These updates, combined with many others, help explain why social interest and cashtag searches for XRP have recently been on the rise on X and other social media platforms.

Title: Newly discovered JFK archive lands at De Búrca’s valued at €45,000

Former American president John F Kennedy remains a hugely iconic figure in the Irish imagination. Not just because of his Irish Catholic heritage, but also because he was the first sitting US president to visit Ireland in June 1963, a mere five months before he was assassinated in Dallas, Texas. For these reasons the newly discovered archive of signed letters, press photographs and an inscribed portrait of Kennedy, valued by De Búrca Rare Books at €45,000, should attract significant interest. “The material has remained intact and unseen on the open market until now, and is the biggest single archive of John K Kennedy we have put on the market,” says Will de Búrca. The privately owned collection – for sale now via the Blackrock seller of rare books – includes four typed letters. The letters, three of which have the John F Kennedy for President campaign letterhead, provide an insight into Kennedy’s campaign strategy as presidential contender. For example, two of the letters were sent to Charlotte Ward, who worked as a volunteer on Kennedy’s presidential campaign in 1960, thanking her for her support. “Kennedy’s personal tone reflects the campaign’s emphasis on grassroots, human-level engagement, a communications style that helped solidify the Kennedy image as charismatic, direct and youthful,” says Will de Búrca. Kennedy’s team relied heavily on enthusiastic local volunteers, especially the “Kennedy Girls”, a co-ordinated national programme designed to project glamour, energy and youth around the candidate. The archive also includes a black-and-white matte portrait of John F Kennedy, personally inscribed by him to Fionnula O’Sullivan. A complete set of six original 1964 photographs from United Press International, stamped with “For Personal Use Only/Not For Publication”, are also included. These press photographs documented Kennedy’s personal effects as they were being catalogued for transfer to the John F Kennedy Memorial Library. They include a photograph of the president’s desk, with the final day appointment calendar for Thursday, November 21st, with the last entry, Depart South Lawn for Texas. This was the trip during which he was assassinated on November 22nd, 1963. Another photograph shows JFK’s hi-fi set and his favourite Irish LPs. Another is of the handwritten doodles he was well known for making during meetings, while another is of his personal rocking chair, prescribed for his chronic back pain. “As a complement to the signed letters and inscribed photographs, these images deepen the emotional and narrative arc of the collection, moving from Kennedy during the 1960 campaign to his presidential persona to the physical remnants of his life gathered after his death,” says de Búrca. Collectors of Irish silver will have a couple of opportunities to seek out special pieces in the next week or so, with Hegarty Antiques selling the Part Two of a lifetime collection of Irish silver in their online auction on January 21st. Lisa Keane of Hegarty’s says that the Bandon auction house found 2025 to be a strong year for Irish silver – particularly provincial silver from Cork. “The majority of our buyers were from Ireland, but we did reach a worldwide market with buyers from Australia and the United States,” she says. Meanwhile, Irish silver expert Jimmy Weldon, of JW Weldon on Clarendon Street, Dublin, will be one of the stallholders at the first National Antique Fairs of 2026 at Limerick Racecourse on January 24th and 25th. Although a niche area for collectors, Irish silver with clear hallmarks made by historically significant Georgian silversmiths, still captures the attention of keen buyers. Silver made in Limerick, Waterford, Galway and Kinsale is also often of greater interest than Dublin-made silverware, because of its rarity. Weldon says prices are still very low for antique Irish silver. “It is very reasonable and underpriced,” says Weldon. His pièce de résistance at the Limerick fair will be an early 18th century Irish Queen Anne tankard for €17,500, made by David King. “King was one of the top three silver makers in Dublin and this is one of the best pieces of silver I ever bought,” says Weldon. “It would be a fine investment for someone.” Other pieces for sale will be an 18th-century silver tureen made by Dublin silver smith John Lloyd (€4,500), and an 18th-century Irish silver beer jug made by Dublin-based silversmith, Robert Calderwood (€17,500). Anyone clearing out period homes should consider bringing old hallmarked cutlery, coffee pots, candlesticks and silver trays to auctioneers for valuation, as you might be surprised by their value. For example, there is an Irish silver shell bowl soup ladle in Hegarty’s auction with an estimate of €350-€450, even though the maker’s mark is unclear. Weldon says he is always willing to value items – and even buy pieces – at antique fairs. “You never know what someone might bring along on the day,” he says. “But it must be silver. Anything that is silver-plated has little value.” hegartyantiques.com, deburcararebooks.com, weldons.ie Estimate €12,000 – €18,000 Hammer €15,000 Auction house Morgan O’Driscoll Estimate €50,000-€70,000 Hammer €44,000 Auction house Morgan O’Driscoll Estimate €1,500- €2,500 Hammer €4,200 Auction house Adam’s Estimate €500-€700 Hammer €1,900 Auction house Mullens Laurel Park © 2025 The Irish Times DAC
