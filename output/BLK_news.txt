Title: Nineteen Years of Shifting Goals

It is time for 19! Number 19 – Corvette No, not that 19. The blog turns 19 today. Ever WP.com admits I have been around that long. The annual WP.com greeting And 19 years is kind of a long time, with nearly a third of my life involving me tapping out typo filled first drafts and pressing the publish button more than 7,500 times. But we’ll get to the silly stats a bit further down the page. And yet it feels a bit like a lesser turning of the years, just one shy of 20, a nice big round number that is so much more impressive than 19. 19 feels like it is almost there, while 20 has arrived. Or so it goes with those of us who count in base 10 I suppose. As part of Blaugust I reflected a bit on the writing process, as I am wont to do, but also considered the goals of the blog, what my writing assignment here is, was, and might end up being. I say that because I certainly didn’t start out the way things are now. It took a while to establish whatever we call what I am doing now. If we go back to that very first post back in September of 2006, I seemed to want to write about games I had already played, to go over my history. And I certainly did some of that. I wrote about early online games like Stellar Emperor and Air Warrior and TorilMUD. I tried to tease out memories of things like Starsiege: Tribes and the early days of EverQuest. You can find more than a few posts about games I played before I started blogging. But things quickly turned to talking about MMOs and what might come next. We were in both the age of blogging and of MMORPG popularity. We were going to have all sorts of MMOs, and they were going to be about anything and everything. Even Micheal Jackson. Planet Michael… only to be imaged, never to be seen And then the WoW killer… because surely somebody would come along and dethrone the mighty king of MMORPGs… never appeared. It captured and dominated the market and its peak was never eclipsed in the west and developers game up on that and started trying to cash in on the next trend, which was Facebook games or free to play MMOs or MOBAs or Kickstarted nostalgia farming name driven projects… all of which I covered some here and there. Almost all of them failed to live up to their promise and most failed to survive for very long. As part of that I started posting about events and launches and expansions and updates, if only just to establish a timeline so that I could remember what changed when. Along the way I wrote about what I was playing. At first those posts were haphazard, lacking in detail and mostly just “I did a thing” without much around it. That developed as a style, focused around the instance group and our adventures in Azeroth, but also around EVE Online and the ongoing struggle to find the game in the sandbox. That expanded to other games we played and got more detailed. Likewise, once I found my niche in null sec, posts about the ups and downs of space empires in New Eden began to figure much more. For no real reason beyond “it seemed like a good idea at the time” I wrote a Month in Review post at the end of that first September and have continued to do so every since. While those posts feature quite a bit of fluff, the revisiting of what I wrote about a year ago, five years ago, ten years ago, and so on… that became a cornerstone of my own experience with the blog, reminding me of the past and where I have been and what I have done online. In the end, it turned out the blog turned out to be about games I had played, my gaming history and such. I was just writing it as it went and it slowly became nearly two decades of history, and not all of it a complete waste. There is a whole page or so in Empires of EVE: Vol II that reprints my observations on the battle at 6VDT-H. My account, written the next day while the events of the battle were still fresh in my mind ended up being, ended up being able to provide some flavor of the battle in a book about the conflict of empires in which I was just one guy in a ship. And I still get a nod now and then for having written up something that didn’t make the news or other outlets. Recently I even got a nice message from Asher Elias, head of the Imperium, who is working on his own history of the game and null sec who said: your site has been so helpful it’s hard to overstate the value I feel pretty good about that. The blog, in the end, became something of what I intended, if not in exactly how I envisioned getting there. Though, again, that might apply more to EVE Online that other titles due to the nature of the game. The player driven nature of New Eden means that major events, battles and such, are one time unique events. Meanwhile, in WoW for example, every Deadmines run faces the exact same set of challenges, so the tale of our group is hardly unique save for the fact that we were there for that particular moment. What do I take from that? Don’t hesitate to write down some event? Maybe. Different from where I started for sure. And even these anniversary posts have evolved over time. As I always say, look at all the work I put into some of those early posts. They had themes! Now… well, go back and look at some of the old ones if you want fancy. Here they are: That is the preliminaries. Actually, I even gave you most of the reflections up front this time. Not sure what I’ll have at the back end. We shall see. The Basic Stats Days since launch: 6,940 (+376, because I had to calculate early last year) Posts total: 7,572 (+400) Total Words: 6,783,396 Average words per post: 895 (+58) Post Likes: 25,294 Average posts per day: 1.091 (-0.001… I am slowing… so very slowly) Comments: 40068 (+1,089) Average comments per post: 5.29 (-0.12) Average comments per day: 5.77 (-0.25) Comments written by me: 8,264 or 20.6% Space used by images: 4.7 GB used, 9.1 GB (70.2%) upload space remaining. Blog Subscribers: 3,523 (+975, mostly spammers) US Presidents since launch: 4 British Monarchs since launch: 2 Prime Ministers of Italy since launch: 9 Summary: I write a lot of words still and we have a retread president. Also, last year in my rush to get on a plane for our 25th wedding anniversary trip I totally didn’t update some of those numbers and I am too lazy to go re-figure the increment. But nobody commented on my, for example, saying I had surpassed the word count for the Wheel of Time series of books when the number I was showing was clearly less than that. But I am well past that now. Data Unfiltered So what is going on here at the blog? People still come to visit. Not as many as used to, but many more than I figured ever would. So let’s see what the numbers are, starting with page views. Year 19 – Page views by month If you add up the numbers along the right hand side it comes out to something like 6,863,443 page views over the life of the blog. That is more than I ever expected, though probably less than somebody like Amazon gets over the course of a minute on any given day. You can see the peaks and valleys of the site over the years. The high point was 2012, as I have oft indicated. Things really fell off after Covid, with 2021 and 2022 seeing the lowest numbers since the first year of the blog. Then things have revived a bit. Summed up by full year… so leaving out 2006 and 2025 so far… the trend looks like this. TAGN Page View Traffic by Full Years – 2007 through 2024 2007 remains the full year with the lowest count, but 2022 wasn’t that far behind. And then there is one more chart I usual toss in here. I usually just paste in an image of it, but I prefer actual numbers rather than pictures of numbers, so I am once again going to let WP format some data from Excel. So that is either a nicely formatted chart with numbers or a bunch of mushed up garbage, likely the latter if you’re reading this on your phone. Sorry about that. As you can see, until this year the number of words per post had been mostly rising. I don’t know what got into me in 2024, where I got close to 1,500 words per post, but this year I am down somewhat. Part of the rise in words has to be my month in review posts, which get a chunk longer every five years. But most of it is likely me taking care to fill in more details about things in posts as you never know what is going to end up being a critical or interesting tidbit of information years down the road. Who Sends People Here? Search engines. Seriously, that is most of the traffic. And Google is 98% of the search engine traffic. He is how search engines shake out. Google is on there three times… though Google Image Search isn’t the mighty referral engine it once was… because Google decided to just download all your images… excuse me, it cached them. On the bright side, Bing recognizes me again. It had de-indexed me for a stretch. On the flip side of that, does it matter? Also, hello my two AOL users, because I doubt the same AOL user landed here twice. Then there is social media and social media like sites… who no longer send me that much traffic anymore. At one time social media was a lot better at sending traffic out. But now sites like X go out of their way to keep people from leaving. Not that I post anything to X in any case, I deleted my account there more than a year back. New on the list, the AI sites are coming for us! Not really a force to be reckoned with at this point, but some of those sites only recently started trying to show their work. Then there are my fellow bloggers. They do send me a bit of traffic, more than some social media sites I post to daily. Here are the top ten blogs that send me traffic. Eight of those ten are Blogger based blogs that use the dynamic blogroll sidebar widget. Two of those eight aren’t even updated regularly, but still send me traffic due to that blogroll option. The Greybill is a fellow WP.com blog and just linked to me about a couple of EVE Online things, which I appreciate. And then there is I Has PC… or there isn’t I Has PC, as the site no longer responds. But is sent me a bit of traffic right up until the very end. More Frivolous Data We’ll start once again with the top ten categories of posts here, and the change since last year. Out of 104 total categories, a number unchanged since last year, these are, were, and remain, the most used. Null Sec, which is a sub-category, made it on to the list this year. Meanwhile, Sony Online Entertainment, a category that hasn’t been valid or used for the last decade, that finally fell off the top ten. Then there are tags, which represent the land of chaos. Tags I slap on a post at a whim, as a joke, as a futile attempt to signal tone or intention. And sometimes I use tags for games I am not sure quite deserve a category yet. No Man’s Sky is only a tag so far. So there are 5,065 tags used on the blog, up 287 from last year. For tags I feel like I have to do a top 20 just to get some scope. As always, the category often drives the tags used. If I write more EVE Online posts than anything else, then there are more EVE Online related tags. And, as I have done in the past, here are the tags I have used exactly 19 times over the last 19 years. It turns out there are ten of them. I actually know what all of those are related to. Last year I had a couple of “uh?” items on the list. What Do People Read Here? Here are the Top 20 most viewed posts over the last 12 months here on the site: That tells you what is popular, or at least what Google sends me. I seem to be answering some Pokemon Go questions for people, with five posts on the list. I am also interested to see how much No Man’s Sky traction I have gotten. As a game I haven’t elevated it to its own category yet because I have only written 16 posts with the associated tag, and a couple of those are month in review summaries. Maybe I should fix that. I gave Elite Dangerous a category slot and only used it four times. Certainly NMS has gotten more play time out of me. Also, I seem to have hit a nerve with my iTunes post. That was… last week, and it made the top 20 for the last 12 months? Then there is the ALL TIME TOP 20 posts list. First of all, I doubt I will ever have another post pass the 50K page view mark. The three that are up there are cemented by having been popular during the peak era of the blog. The average number of page views for the top 500 posts, which is all WP.com will let me see, is 1,457. The average for all 7,572 posts is probably double digits, even with Alamo and the Play On Guild Name Generator sitting above 60K. There are a lot of posts with 5 page views. There are also some classics in there. The EVE Online tutorial post, which was the fourth post on the site, and the first one addressing a game I was actively playing… well, it was a different time. No screen shots, just ire. I have suggested that it was my desire to rant about that tutorial that finally drove me to start a blog. Otherwise, that is a load of stuff that Google liked at one point or another. The Inevitable Summing Up Sometimes I arrive at this point in these annual posts and wonder aloud if I should take a break, not write so much, or change up what I write about. But if you’ve read down this far you’re not falling for that. I can’t even fool myself on that front anymore. Hell, last year I said I might not bother to do an annual review post, but here I am, Mister Unreliable Narrator. No matter how tired I am at the end of the day, I somehow always have something I want to post about. And it is even about video games most days! My goal, which I ended up setting a year or two in when I decided to reign in chaos and maybe have a plan, was to have a post on every week day, leaving aside weekends for overflow or non-gaming topics of whatever. I have somehow exceeded that plan… to the point that I have posted every day for the last 1,993 days in a row, or every day since March 29, 2020. Maybe I could give up on that streak… though, again, just seven more days for a round number. Really, though, I am wondering what I should do for the 20th next year. Open to ideas. Just 12 months to work that out. I started reading during the Casino War. The blog epitomized that Eve is a game I love reading about but never want to play. I stayed for the WoW and “history of Silicon Valley” content. Now you’re now a daily read for me. Congrats on 19 years! LikeLike Congratulations for the milestone. When it comes to the referral stats I’ve always wondered what it counts old school accessing via a favourite/ manually typing in the address – which is what I still mostly doing But yes, I can quite see your blog now being a resource for EVE history (and MMOs in general) quite similar to reviewing old newspapers. A contemporaneous record which reminds me, in a strange way, of some of the mediaeval annals I used to study at university. Which also used to have digressions onto this and that, just like your blog does. Anyways, hope you have a good twentieth year, and that these virtual worlds allow you to escape at least now and then from the “real” world, whatever the hell that is anymore. LikeLike Grats on another year. I do rememner when you were wondering out loud how much longer you’d go on. Glad to hear that’s stopped! Shame to hear I Has PC has folded. I thought I’d seen a couple of comments by Isey here and there, this year. I tried to look something up on Herding Cats the other day and Liore’s gone too. Confusingly, there is an unrelated blog called I Like Herding Cats… Still, I keep them all in that so-useful Blogger blogroll because if any of the dead ones ever sputter back into life, they pop up right back at the top and everyne knows about it. It’s like a public service now… LikeLike Well done. If in Australia your blog would be starting its second year of legally being able to drink alcohol. While I might go research something you have said – I don’t recall ever fact checking you, so I missed the wheel of time test. LikeLike Congrats! Has your blog signed up for Selective Service yet? LikeLike I had to look that up… and I guess it is still a thing. I did that 42 years ago. LikeLike Proud to link to you from both my blogs! And I just wanted to say I also find your “posting to mark various events/milestones” useful, even as someone who doesn’t play EVE. There has been more than one occasion when I’d wonder about something like “didn’t I read about Everquest doing something like that once” and your blog is often a great place to verify random MMO trivia like that. I’ve also found your whole attitude towards blogging inspiring and am definitely emulating it a bit in the sense that I also post about many things with an eye to wanting to be able to have a reference point in the future. Documenting things is fun! Anyway, grats on 19. LikeLike Δ Email Address: Email Posts to Me!

Title: Asset Managers Point to Dangers of ‘Over-Customization’ of Portfolios

“Personalization gone too far I think erodes the value of really great active management with really great risk management wrapped around it,” said one asset manager. September 12, 2025 Over the last five years, direct indexing has been talked about as the next frontier in investment management, and demand for these strategies continues to rise. As of the end of 2024, there were $864.3 billion in direct indexing strategies, according to Cerulli Associates. Several asset managers, speaking at the Future Proof Festival in Huntington Beach, Calif., this week, confirmed the demand for personalized and customized investment strategies. But they also warned against “over-customization.” “Personalization can mean vastly different things when it comes to investing,” said Andrea Lisher, head of Americas, Client, J.P. Morgan Asset Management. “If you look at long-term track records, it’s very, very difficult to beat the markets, and if every individual could do that—do their own thing—you wouldn’t need firms like ours who spend hundreds of millions of dollars on research and traders and risk managers and generating alpha.” Lisher said it’s one thing if a client wants to invest based on their personal values and they’re willing to make the tradeoffs, or if a client has a concentrated stock position. “That’s not what I’m talking about,” she said. “I’m talking about the notion that personalization has gone too far, I think, erodes the value of really great active management with really great risk management wrapped around it.” Related:AI Disruption Fear Sparks Investor Scrutiny of Software Stocks She added that direct indexing must be a delicate balance of art and science, and it’s very difficult to get right. Jaime Magyera, head of BlackRock’s U.S. Wealth Advisory business, said it comes down to client segments. “For let’s call it 80% of investors out there, a strategic asset allocation, long-term asset allocation that’s diversified across equities and fixed income is the path to success,” she said. “There is a segment—that high-net-worth investor, someone who has deep beliefs—where they want to align the S&P 500 but they want to customize that.” The tax management aspect of direct indexing is designed for high-net-worth investors, she said, who actually have enough capital gains to benefit from the strategy. It’s not for everyone. “I worry about getting a little overcustomized, overpersonalized and over-direct indexed when a portfolio of ETFs across equity and fixed income with a strategic asset allocation is a very fine solution,” she said. Kristie Feinberg, president and CEO of Manulife John Hancock Investments, agreed that personalization has different meanings for different people, and that overcustomization could be an issue. But she said there’s a real benefit to providing tailored solutions, and technology can make it easier. Related:Powell Opens Door to Interest Rate Cut, Citing Labor Markets “I do think there is a real need for personalization within portfolios,” she said. “That’s what we do today; we create plans that are personalized. To be able to do that in a way that brings in technology to make it more efficient, to make it more effective, is where you’re going to see the real power.” Both BlackRock and J.P. Morgan have made big bets on direct indexing. In 2020, BlackRock announced its acquisition of Aperio, a creator of tailored index strategies. That same year, J.P. Morgan announced plans to acquire 55ip, a fintech startup that provides advisors with automated tax technology and a tax-smart investment strategy engine. BlackRock’s Magyera said direct indexing is one of the fastest-growing areas of the market, especially for higher-net-worth clients looking for real after-tax returns. “If you’re going to win with that segment, you do need to have differentiated, unique solutions, like direct indexing, like option overlays.” Diana Britton Executive Editor, WealthManagement.com Diana Britton is the Executive Editor of WealthManagement.com, covering independent broker/dealers and RIAs from all angles.

Title: This 12% CEF Could Be Gen Z’s Next Investing Obsession
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelfoster/2025/09/12/this-12-cef-could-be-gen-zs-next-investing-obsession/

ByMichael Foster, Contributor. We all know that stocks can rise on nothing but hype for long periods. But at the end of the day, it all comes back to one thing: profits! If they don’t rise, the stock will tank. It’s just a matter of time. Consider the case of Peloton Interactive (PTON). When the pandemic had everyone exercising indoors, speculators piled into the stock, hoping that soaring earnings would ignite the company’s value. Peloton’s net income was deep in the red then. Fast-forward to today, and it’s still negative. The stock has, of course, dropped to reflect that. What I’m getting at here is the idea that a stock can gain on hopes of future earnings, but that only lasts for so long. When investors give up hope, losses are inevitable. Of course, that isn’t the only way to make money in stocks. Those who invest based on the idea that profits will rise in the future can make a profit. Look no further than Peloton itself: Anyone who bought in 2020 with the expectation that demand for that stock would rise in the coming months made a bundle. Indeed, there were over 400% gains within a year for the most aggressive traders. Can we play this supply/demand game with high-yielding assets like closed-end funds (CEFs)? Yes. One way to do so is to buy a CEF when its discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio) is wide, and market fears are peaking. Consider the 27.3% price gain the BlackRock Science and Technology Term Trust (BSTZ), a holding of my CEF Insider service, saw as its discount narrowed from 13% in October 2024 to 7.7% now. The gain in the market price was just part of the story—BSTZ’s NAV also rose. That’s why CEFs tend to be solid long-term investments: We get upside from the appreciation of the portfolio and gains in the market price as investors bid it up, cutting the discount. I bring all of this up now because I’m expecting demand for CEFs—especially tech-focused CEFs like BSTZ—to rise in the years ahead. The source of that demand may surprise you: younger investors—particularly Generation Z, born between 1997 and 2012. Now, “young investors” and “dividends” aren’t often mentioned in the same sentence, but that’s changing. Bloomberg recently reported that dividends are increasingly catching young people’s attention. In a September 4, 2025, article, reporters Denitsa Tsekova and Vildana Hajric write: As a result, Bloomberg reports, Gen Z is moving away from the riskier investments that dominated the headlines in recent years and turning to more staid payouts that older investors have used to obtain financial independence for over a century: dividends! “Unlike meme stocks or crypto moonshots, this strategy—what might be referred to as dividends and chill [italics mine]— preaches control and consistency, a monthly drip over flash-in-the-pan riches,” Bloomberg continues. “Not YOLO, just yield.” There is a key difference between how young and older investors are approaching dividends, however. Right now, according to Bloomberg, Gen Z is focusing on ETFs that “offering eye-popping yields generated by complex derivatives.” These, of course, come with their own risks. Consider the 66.6%-yielding (not a typo) YieldMax TSLA Option Income Strategy ETF (TSLY), which has attracted a billion dollars in assets because the fund buys Tesla (TSLA) shares, sells covered calls on them, and passes the income to investors. The good news? It isn’t losing money. The bad news, though, is it’s returned a paltry 17% in the last three years with dividends reinvested. Nonetheless, an interesting thing is likely to happen as young investors start to collect dividends (even outlandish ones like this): They’re likely to want more. And when they mature a little, they’re likely to pivot to sustainable high yields from funds like BSTZ, whose 12% yield is accompanied by a total return (in orange below) that far exceeds that of TSLY over this same time period. Not only does BSTZ boast a double-digit yield and stronger performance than TSLY, but it also trades at that 7.7% discount to NAV, too! (ETFs, for their part, never trade at discounts, as we CEF buyers know well.) It makes no sense for a high-yield, high-return fund like BSTZ to trade for less than the value of its assets. When Gen Z recognizes this, the savviest of them will likely buy in, boosting the fund’s market price and narrowing its discount. By purchasing BSTZ today, we can set ourselves up to capture the profits from that future demand while we enjoy the fund’s 12% yield.

Title: BlackRock eyes tokenized crypto ETFs and stocks – Report

Analyst questioned the potential impact of tokenized market BlackRock wants to expand beyond its BUIDL tokenized money market fund and bring crypto ETFs, stocks, and others on-chain. Is the financial market revolution here? BlackRock is reportedly exploring expanding its tokenized product line to cover its popular crypto and other exchange-traded funds (ETFs). According to a report by Bloomberg, the world’s largest asset manager is mulling going all in on the segment and bringing even stocks on-chain to be traded as digital tokens. However, the plan would be subject to regulatory approval, per the report, citing people familiar with the matter. In less than two years since launching its spot Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH] ETFs, BlackRock’s crypto holdings have surged to $100 billion. Its first tokenized money market fund, BUIDL (BlackRock USD Institutional Liquidity Fund), was launched in March 2024. Now, the product has a market cap of $2.2 billion, held by 90 firms and is spread across six chains. Early this year, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said, ‘Every asset can be tokenized…If that happens, investing will be revolutionized. Markets would never need to close. Settlements would be instantaneous.” He added that it would be the most ‘disruptive innovation since ETFs.’ However, some critics still questioned the value of such a move. According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, the ‘on-chain’ group was still too small to warrant the hype. “I don’t see the value add for the consumer to get them to switch. ETFs are always underestimated.” Source: X Interestingly, Nasdaq also asked for the SEC to allow it to list tokenized equities with equal rights as traditional shareholders. That said, tokenized stocks will still be securities, according to SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce. Hence, they must still follow securities law. But the regulators are racing to offer clear rules for the road amid increasing interest in the segment.

Title: Minute Media acquires AI-based VideoVerse to enhance sports content creation

FREE MEETING: KEY TRENDS AND RISKS IN TECH GAMES– REGISTER Minute Media, a sports-focused media holding company backed by BlackRock and Goldman Sachs, has acquired VideoVerse, an Indian AI startup that specializes in extracting highlights and creating content from sports footage. The acquisition, announced on Monday, is considered the largest for Minute Media in terms of value and size. VideoVerse, founded in 2016 by Vinayak Shrivastav, Saket Dandotia, and Alok Patil, has raised $105 million to date from investors such as Bluestone Equity Partners, A91 Partners, Alpha Wave, Evolvence India, and Moneta Ventures. While the exact valuation of the acquisition remains undisclosed, sources indicate that VideoVerse was valued between $200 million and $250 million during its last funding round in 2023. The Mumbai-based startup initially developed various AI tools, including those for detecting smoking and drinking scenes in movies, and object identification for e-commerce sites. However, in 2016, VideoVerse shifted its focus to building video editing and detection tools for sports broadcasters, starting with a project for Hotstar (now owned by Jio) to identify specific action points in cricket. VideoVerse operates as a SaaS tool, charging based on the number of footage hours processed. The company has grown to $65 million in revenue with a healthy EBITDA margin of 35% to 40%. Recently, VideoVerse launched new AI-powered tools that allow clients to automatically generate content by defining rules, such as creating a package of all three-pointers made by a specific basketball player for social media publication. Minute Media plans to leverage VideoVerse’s technology along with its own publisher network, which includes properties like Sports Illustrated, The Players’ Tribune, and 90 Minutes, to distribute content more effectively and generate ad revenue. The sports media company reaches over 200 million monthly users and offers a B2B platform used by nearly 500 publishers. Asaf Peled, CEO of Minute Media, stated, “With VideoVerse, we can pitch an AI suite for content creation to our customers, then add our distribution and monetization capabilities to get more value out of the content.” The acquisition will enable Minute Media to attract more U.S.-based leagues to its highlight-generating platform, responding to a market shift where fans seek diverse content beyond traditional coverage, especially on mobile devices. Peled added that although the company is not actively seeking funding now, it may pursue further funding rounds in the coming quarters for additional acquisitions.

At the same time, Washington is unlikely to force Qatar to expel Hamas leadership entirely, as Doha remains a necessary conduit for hostage and ceasefire talks. For energy, the North Field expansion is still proceeding toward 126 mtpa by 2027, with trains already financed and contractors committed. The risk is more in the realm of perception: insurers, banks, and buyers may begin to build a sovereignty-breach premium into contracts. Watch for whether the Saudis or Emiratis lean toward treating the strike as an aberration or as a tolerated precedent. If they quietly normalize it, markets may read Doha as more exposed. If they close ranks around Qatar’s sovereignty, that reassures investors that the strike was a one-off shock. By Friday morning, Qatar was kicking the diplomatic posturing into overdrive. It’s a delicate balancing act. Doha’s posture has to be precisely calibrated. The foreign ministry denounced the strike as “state terrorism” and vowed legal action. Doha is explicitly putting itself in damage-control mode, trying to preserve its mediation legitimacy while positioning Israel as the aggressor. Qatar needs to show its domestic and regional audience that it will not be cowed, but it also cannot abandon the one role that keeps Washington and European capitals invested in its utility. Doha’s narrative is that hosting Hamas was always transparent and coordinated with the U.S. and Israel, shifting blame back onto Netanyahu. The calculation is to rally Gulf and Arab partners around sovereignty while reminding Washington that undermining Qatar also undermines hostage and ceasefire channels. Adani Ports, which controls India’s largest private port network, has now barred any vessel under U.S., EU, or UK sanctions from calling at its facilities. Agents must certify that ships are clean of designations before berthing. Mundra, Adani’s flagship port, is a key entry point for Russian crude handled by IOC and HPCL-Mittal; those flows will now face new friction. Refiners can reroute via non-Adani ports or source non-designated tonnage, but costs will rise and scheduling will tighten. The move is significant because India’s formal policy has been to ignore unilateral Western sanctions and only respect UN mandates. A private operator is effectively tightening compliance on its own, underlining the liability calculus of global finance and insurers. Washington will interpret this as success based on Trump’s pressure. Moscow will see another crack in India’s ability to shield its imports. For India’s refiners, the adjustment is immediate: higher freight and insurance premiums, more reliance on gray-fleet tonnage, and the risk of cargo delays. Longer term, it marginally weakens Russia’s grip on India’s oil basket and nudges refiners to keep Middle East and African barrels in reserve. Discovery & Development Pakistan Petroleum Ltd (PPL) struck oil again in the Potwar region, chalking up its second big find in the Dhok Sultan Block, District Attock. The Dhok Sultan-03 well, spudded in January and drilled to 5,815m, is the second deepest oil strike in fractured carbonate formations in the area. Initial tests showed strong flows — 1,469 bpd oil and 2.56 mmscfd gas on a tighter choke, rising to 2,113 bpd and 4.13 mmscfd on a wider one. PPL holds 75% in the block with Government Holdings (Pvt) Ltd (GHPL) at 25%, calling the discovery a major milestone for both partners. Shell has cut a farm-out deal offshore São Tomé & Príncipe, handing Petrobras big stakes in frontier ultra-deepwater Blocks 10, 11, and 13 while keeping 40% and operatorship. ANP-STP retains 15% across the blocks, with Galp holding 20% in Block 11. The acreage sits in the Gulf of Guinea, an emerging “elephant play” zone that’s drawing major attention despite its frontier risk. Petrobras sees the move as a way to rebuild reserves and diversify, while Shell trims exposure but stays in control of a potentially giant prize. MOL and O&GD have hit oil at Galgahévíz-4 in Hungary’s Mogyoród concession, flowing about 1,000 bpd from 2,400m depth after a 37-day drill. The crude is processed at MOL’s Danube Refinery, with volumes split 51/49 between O&GD and MOL, and represents roughly 4% of MOL’s domestic oil output. The find underscores MOL’s push to boost supply security as Hungary still leans heavily on imports, adding to a string of recent discoveries at Vecsés and Somogysámson plus 25 shallow gas successes since 2019. The timing dovetails with the 60th anniversary of the Algy? field, still a supply pillar, now being paired with renewables as MOL builds a 37.4 MWp solar park and 40 MWh storage system to cut emissions and green its legacy hub. BP has walked away from the Pau Brasil block in Brazil’s Santos basin after its much-hyped pre-salt wildcat failed to deliver a commercial find. The company re-entered Brazil in mid-2024 after more than a decade away, drilling with the Valaris DS-15, but results showed only traces of oil in 2,283m water depth. Pau Brasil was part of a production sharing contract, and BP has now relinquished the acreage back to ANP. The move contrasts with BP’s recent pre-salt success elsewhere in Brazil, showing how hit-or-miss frontier drilling in the basin remains. ReconAfrica has inked a PSC with Gabon for the 1,214 sq km Ngulu Block C-7 in shallow water, positioning itself as operator with 55% alongside Record Resources (20%), Gabon Oil Co. (15%), and the state (10%). The block holds the historic Loba discovery, drilled in 1976 with 140m gross pay, plus 28 mapped prospects in Gamba-Dentale plays likened to the Gulf of Mexico. Recon plans geological work, 3D seismic reprocessing, and at least one well during the initial 4-year term, with an option to extend. Loba alone is thought capable of flowing 20,000 b/d, making the block a potentially material addition to Gabon’s offshore profile. Mergers and Acquisitions BlackRock and a Gulf-backed consortium are in advanced talks to raise ~$10.3B for Aramco’s midstream assets, according to sources cited today. The financing push signals strong institutional appetite despite higher global rates, and gives Riyadh another lever to monetize pipelines without ceding equity control. The structure also keeps Western capital tied into Saudi energy infrastructure at a time when Aramco is under pressure to fund expansion, dividends, and domestic megaprojects simultaneously. A $215M merger between Pelican Acquisition, Greenland Exploration, and March GL has created Greenland Energy Co., the first U.S.-listed firm dedicated to developing Greenland’s Jameson Land Basin. ARCO once spent $275M mapping the basin and left behind 1,800 km of seismic and infrastructure, now reprocessed by March GL to identify 50+ drillable targets. Greenland Energy holds rights to up to 70% of three licenses spanning 2M acres, with Halliburton tapped for drilling and heavy equipment already mobilized for the first well site. Executives pitched the venture as both a watershed for Greenland and a strategic play for U.S. and allied energy security in one of the Arctic’s richest undrilled basins. Westgate Energy has scrapped its planned $5.1M (C$7M) acquisition of Mannville Stack assets in East-Central Alberta after failing to secure required third-party consents. The vendor returned Westgate’s C$700K deposit plus interest, ending the deal that would have added 14.5 sections and 57 potential horizontal well locations near Frog Lake. The move comes as Westgate focuses on its own drilling program, where three new wells are still cleaning up and showing promising early rates, with a follow-up campaign at Beaverdam slated for Q4. Management stressed it remains committed to its Mannville Stack growth strategy, calling the play one of the best oil economics in Western Canada. EQV Ventures Acquisition Corp. and Presidio Petroleum have filed with the SEC to merge in a $660M deal that will create Presidio Production Company, a dividend-focused C-Corp set to list on the NYSE under ticker FTW. The transaction is set to close in Q4 2025 and will build on Presidio’s strategy of optimizing mature, low-decline wells for steady cash flow rather than drilling new ones. Anglo American and Teck are merging in a $50B (£36B) deal to form Anglo Teck, headquartered in Vancouver but keeping a London listing. The combined miner will be 70% weighted to copper, with iron ore and zinc rounding out the portfolio, and Anglo shareholders will get a $4.5B special dividend. Anglo will hold 62.4% of the new company, which expects $800M in annual synergies by year four, with CEO Duncan Wanblad leading and Teck’s Jonathan Price as deputy. The move triggered political backlash in the UK as a hit to London’s business standing, though investors sent Anglo’s stock up 7.8% on the news. To access this exclusive content...

Today's top news: Wall Street’s biggest asset manager is about to take tokenization mainstream. Bloomberg reported that BlackRock is preparing to tokenize ETFs and other real-world asset (RWA) funds, expanding beyond its existing on-chain cash management product, BUIDL. The move is pending regulatory approval, but it represents a major step toward bringing traditional investment vehicles onto blockchain rails. BlackRock launched BUIDL with Securitize in 2024, giving institutions tokenized exposure to U.S. Treasuries. Now, the firm wants to extend that model to ETFs and additional fund structures, which would mark the first time a traditional manager has tokenized mainstream funds at scale. Potential types of funds include: These sectors represent Trillions in assets ($12.5T in Q2 2025 to be exact). And a huge chunk of them (maybe eventually all) are coming on-chain. “Just like everyone downplaying digital assets being proven wrong over the last decade.

And there’s a real chance that most of these funds are tokenized on Ethereum (where BUIDL is). If that’s the case, ETH is likely the biggest winner here.

September 12, 2025 06:00 ET | Source: BlackRock Asset Management Canada Limited BlackRock Asset Management Canada Limited TORONTO, Sept. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BlackRock Asset Management Canada Limited (“BlackRock Canada”), an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc. (“BlackRock”) (NYSE: BLK) is announcing changes to two funds. Index Methodology Changes for iShares Exponential Technologies Index ETF The iShares Exponential Technologies Index ETF (“XEXP”) currently seeks to replicate the performance of the Morningstar Exponential Technologies Index (the “Index”), net of expenses. XEXP is expected to experience higher than normal portfolio turnover due to upcoming changes to the evaluation process used to determine the composition of the Index. The composition of the Index will change as part of regularly scheduled rebalances (the “Rebalances”) of the Index on September 19, 2025 and December 19, 2025. Morningstar, Inc. (“Morningstar”), the index provider of the Index, announced on June 6, 2025, that: (1) the Index will be reviewed quarterly in March, June, September and December instead of annually in December; (2) the exponential technology themes will be updated to replace the big data & analytics, hyperconnectivity, and energy transition themes with the artificial intelligence, cybersecurity & defense technology and energy innovation themes; the cloud computing and nanotechnology themes will be removed from the Index; and (3) the Index will transition from being an equal weighted index to a float-adjusted market capitalization-weighted index with the weight of each constituent issuer capped at 4% and the weight of each exponential technology theme capped at 25%. As a result of the Rebalances, XEXP may experience higher than normal transaction costs and realize net capital gains. Annual Management Fee Reduction for iShares India Index ETF Effective on September 12, 2025, the annual management fee of the iShares India Index ETF (“XID”) will change as follows: This action is part of the firm’s regular review of its pricing strategy to reflect continued growth in its product offerings and ability to leverage its scale to benefit investors.

A consortium led by Global Infrastructure Partners, part of BlackRock, is in negotiations with several banks to secure up to $10.3bn in financing for Aramco’s Jafurah gas development deal, reported Reuters, citing two sources familiar with the matter. JPMorgan and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking are among the financial institutions in discussions to support the transaction. Combine business intelligence and editorial excellence to reach engaged professionals across 36 leading media platforms. Find out more The funding arrangement is expected to be divided into short-term and long-term loans. Under the terms of the agreement, a new subsidiary, Jafurah Midstream Gas Company (JMGC), will be responsible for leasing the development and usage rights of gas processing facilities within the Jafurah gas field. These rights will then be leased back to Aramco for a duration of 20 years. This deal follows last month’s $11bn leaseback agreement involving Aramco’s Jafurah gas processing facilities. Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. The Jafurah field, the largest non-associated gas development in Saudi Arabia, is expected to hold 229 trillion standard cubic feet of raw gas and 75 billion stock tank barrels of condensate. Aramco intends to increase its gas production capacity by 60% from 2021 to 2030 to address the growing requirement for gas. JMGC will receive tariffs from Aramco in exchange for exclusive rights to process and treat raw gas from the field. Aramco will maintain a 51% ownership in JMGC, with the remaining 49% held by the investor group. The parties involved, including Aramco, BlackRock, JPMorgan, and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking, have declined to comment on the financing details.

(PTI) JioBlackRock Mutual Fund on Thursday said that it would launch its first active equity product, JioBlackRock FlexiCap Fund, on the Systematic Active Equity platform on September 23. However, he did not set any collection target for this fund during the initial offer period. “This is our first active equity fund. Three or four other active equity funds are in the pipeline, which may see the light of day this fiscal. Other products, including ETFs, will follow in due course,” JioBlackRock AMC chief investment officer Rishi Kohli said. The fund, built on BlackRock’s globally proven SAE platform, follows a rules-based and predominantly machine-driven process tracking 400 signals. About 95 per cent of the investment process will be technology-driven, aiming to eliminate key-person risk, reduce cognitive biases, and ensure disciplined fund management. The SAE Flexi-Cap Fund will maintain a controlled active risk of no more than 3-4 per cent, lower than industry averages, with a focus on downside risk protection and consistent returns for investors. Kohli said a 10-year simulation indicated the model could deliver 3-4 per cent outperformance over the benchmark index, similar to results achieved in other BlackRock country funds. “In an uncertain market environment, where equity markets have been tough, we believe it’s a good time to launch a product that manages risk on the lower side compared to other active funds and still aims for attractive alpha in the long run,” Kohli said. JioBlackRock, the partnership between Jio Financials and the world's largest asset managers BlackRock, received its license in May and currently manages around ₹18,000 crore in assets across eight cash and index funds. The fund house will continue to focus on digital distribution in the near term. The official, however, did not comment on AUM targets or a break-even timeline.

While the crypto market’s broader bullish sentiment is being driven by the strong possibility of a Federal Reserve rate cut decision, the tokens' rise coincides with BlackRock’s plans to introduce exchange-traded funds onto public blockchains, Bloomberg reported Wednesday. Ondo is up nearly 10% on the day to $1.10 after clocking more than 21% gains this week, CoinGecko data shows. Thursday's gains follow last week's launch of tokenized versions of more than 100 U.S.-listed stocks, ETFs, and other equities on Ethereum via the DeFi protocol's Global Markets platform. Lai Yuen, investment analyst at Fischer8 Capital, told Decrypt Ondo’s price rise is likely driven by “excitement around tokenized stocks.” Onboarded partners and advisors for Ondo’s Global Markets, which includes the likes of WisdomTree, have helped grow the platform by $160 million in TVL over nine days. That all but “underscores the project’s strong early traction,” Yuen said. Ondo Finance's total value locked, meanwhile, has nearly tripled since the start of 2025, growing from $611 million to $1.57 billion, DefiLlama data shows. The long-term outlook remains bullish, according to Yuen, who posits that even if the project captures 10% of the stock market, it would translate to “substantial fee generation for Ondo token holders.” “The project’s regulatory moat, bolstered by its advisory board, provides a durable long-term advantage that will be difficult for competitors to replicate,” he said.

Title: Trailblazer Tania Rosser brings a different school of thought to Gonzaga head coach role
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2025/09/12/trailblazer-tania-rosser-brings-a-different-school-of-thought-to-gonzaga-head-coach-role/
Time Published: 2025-09-12T05:00:00Z
Full Content:
It’s a Thursday afternoon, Tania Rosser is on her way to Gonzaga College in Ranelagh, south Dublin, to take training for the senior cycle rugby players. First though, before they hit the pitches, about 50 of those pupils will do yoga, an innovation she has introduced since taking the position of head coach to the Senior Cup team during the summer. It’s a statement appointment, and not in a headline-courting manner. In coming through an interview process conducted by principal Damien McCaul and vice principal Stephen Carey, she wasn’t just the best woman for the position – she was the preferred and best applicant. The New Zealand native, who arrived in Ireland 23 years ago, played international rugby across three different codes – touch, sevens and XVs. She won 58 caps for Ireland and participated in three World Cups, during the last of which she came out of retirement to help orchestrate Ireland’s victory over New Zealand in 2014. Rosser was a player-coach at DLSP and Blackrock College, coached J1 (seconds) men’s team and did skills work with the AIL squad in Clontarf. She coached the women’s team in Old Belvedere and several of the Irish touch rugby international teams before leading the Leinster women to back-to-back interprovincial titles during a three-year tenure that started in 2021. Her passion for rugby stems from childhood. The youngest of five siblings to Denis and Nancy, she grew up on a “massive farm” in Hawke’s Bay before the family subsequently moved into the town of Hastings when she was a little older. Brothers Ray and Dan were sent to boarding school and the only time she got to see them was at rugby matches on weekends. Rosser admits to being the tiresome little sister, a shadow for her brothers who were eight and 10 years older. She wanted to play rugby but her parents forbade it, directing her towards netball and basketball, at which she excelled. She used to sneak out to play rugby until she was caught and grounded. That rebellious streak – the refusal to have other people define her boundaries – has travelled with her in life. She badgered her father to set up a touch rugby footie team, to legitimise her participation. The first time her parents saw her play rugby was for Ireland in a 43-0 defeat to France at the 2006 World Cup in Edmonton, Canada. She wanted to be a police officer but qualified as a primary schoolteacher at the behest of her mother, who thought the former occupation was too dangerous. She then moved to Ireland with her husband Simon Broughton, who had received a rugby-playing offer from Ballymena in the All-Ireland League. It was supposed to be two years but relocating to Dublin changed the plan. Simon – now the Leinster Academy manager – played with DLSP and Leinster, as did Tania. Her first coach at the Kilternan club was George Hook. During Covid she enrolled in a high-performance coaching course with World Rugby. Former England and Australia backs coach Scott Wisemantel was one of the mentors, while she got to do online workshops with former Ireland coach Eddie O’Sullivan and New Zealand mental skills guru Gilbert Enoka. When her three years at Leinster finished, she was on the lookout for another challenge and decided to pursue the position at Gonzaga. Long-time Senior Cup team (SCT) coach Declan Fassbender, who led his alma mater to three Senior Cup finals including a first ever success in 2023, vacated the role to concentrate on coaching Lansdowne. So why Gonzaga? “I just decided to throw my name in, send in my CV in and see what would come of it. “I (was) really disappointed that I couldn’t keep going with Leinster. So, I was looking for a new challenge and thought why not apply? I got the interview, went in and met the principal and deputy principal and had an honest conversation. They seemed open to it.” She’s not the first woman to be involved in coaching an SCT team, even in Ranelagh. Sandford Park school, a middling punt from the entrance to Gonzaga, had former New Zealand sevens and rugby league international Mere Baker – she also worked with the Railway Union club at the time – as part of their senior coaching team in the early to mid-2010s. Rosser started working with her new charges during the summer. “The boys started doing strength and conditioning in July, about 40 kids. I thought it would be a good idea to go in, sit with them, meet them one-on-one, find out what’s driving them, what they like about rugby, what they don’t like about rugby, just asking them a bit about themselves. “And just having that opportunity to say to them, look, my job is to make sure that they’re okay as people first. If they’re not well, or if they’re struggling in school or something, it’s okay – just come and tell me before training, and then we know that you’re off. “Sometimes when these players turn up, we don’t know what’s happening at home or at school, or if they’ve had a hard day. And a lot of times these kids don’t get to say it because they’re too afraid. It’s taken the boys a while to warm to being open with their feelings but there has been a little purchase of late.” Rosser’s principles in coaching young people is refreshing. “My whole thing is, there has to be life after this (schools rugby) for them. Too many kids don’t go on and play club rugby after the Senior Cup because they’re beaten up or broken, or they haven’t enjoyed it. “So how can I keep them, give them longevity, because there’s a long journey in their life and rugby career, if they continue to play club rugby. It’s just a holistic approach. It’s probably very different from other Senior Cup teams and I’m okay with it. I’m okay with people going ‘she’s mad’ or ‘this is ridiculous’. “I don’t care what people think outside the programme or the environment. I look at doing things differently – bringing in yoga, making the boys bring recovery food to every single session before they get on the pitch, checking in with them. “I like using different approaches. I shared with them my journey growing up, you know, facing racism (her mum is Maori), and being on an isolated farm, so they got a sense of who I was. The most important thing I said, the first thing is, I’m a mum. “By the time we get through this campaign, you’ll be like my kid. If you need me, if you give me all you can, I’ll always have your back, on and off the pitch. It’s just how I am with players.” Rosser looks to empower them on the pitch too. Her coaching operandi is inclusive rather than despotic. She’s had conversations with the boys, teasing out options for the game plan on the basis that if they don’t work, they can be discarded. It’s an interaction that wouldn’t be commonplace. At home there is a fair amount of rugby talk with Simon as Leinster academy manager and her son Serge, a pupil at St Andrew’s College and part of the Leinster Under-19s squad. He’s a scrumhalf, like mum, “only better”, in her words. He’s named after the great French fullback Serge Blanco, whom both his parents loved as a player. Serge was very nearly called Fionn. Tania couldn’t pronounce the name adequately with her Kiwi accent, so her then-Ireland rugby teammates advised her not to go there. She’s never been cowed by how others perceive her and is excited for what lies ahead. Rosser doesn’t look at glass ceilings, she just does what she has to do because it never occurred to her not to. She has encountered misogyny, asked whether she was the physio or the manager, but it doesn’t ruffle her savoir-faire. In the past, she’s noticed that “between a male counterpart in my role and myself, I’d say that the male counterpart gets things a lot easier than I would”. She added: “And I’m okay with that. I’m okay with working to try and break down barriers. I’ll push the boundaries as far as I can, ask questions and try to make things better for our set-up.” The Gonzaga boys will be the latest beneficiaries of that mindset. From her childhood days, she’s had to persuade people to give her an opportunity and that she’d take care of the rest. The level of success that ensued speaks for itself. A trailblazer and a woman for others, to tweak the Jesuit mantra. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

The Avalanche Foundation, a non-profit organization that supports the Avalanche (AVAX) blockchain ecosystem, is reportedly seeking to raise $1 billion through a major fundraising campaign to create two AVAX treasuries. This initiative aligns with a broader trend in the cryptocurrency space, where various organizations and traditional finance firms are experimenting with crypto treasury models to strengthen their financial stability and operational capabilities. According to the Financial Times, the Avalanche Foundation is in advanced talks to create two crypto treasuries in the United States. These moves come at a time when the foundation is gaining traction among institutional investors, with firms like BlackRock and Visa already utilizing the Avalanche blockchain for their operations. The foundation’s strategy involves launching one digital asset treasury company while converting an existing firm into a treasury vehicle. The goal is to secure approximately $1 billion, with the expectation to finalize these deals within weeks. The funds raised are earmarked for the acquisition of millions of AVAX tokens, which will be offered at a discounted price directly from the Avalanche Foundation. This approach is aimed to not only support the foundation’s growth but also to enhance the liquidity and market presence of AVAX amid an increasingly competitive treasury companies landscape. Per the report, the first fundraising deal aims to secure up to $500 million through a private investment led by Hivemind Capital, with expectations to finalize the agreement by the end of the month. Notably, Anthony Scaramucci, a crypto investor and former White House press secretary, is advising on this initiative. The second funding endeavor involves a special purpose acquisition vehicle (SPAC) sponsored by Dragonfly Capital, which is also targeting a $500 million raise. This deal may take longer to conclude, potentially stretching into October. Both initiatives will focus on purchasing discounted AVAX tokens held by the Avalanche Foundation, which has a total supply of 720 million tokens, with approximately 420 million currently circulating. The broader cryptocurrency market has seen a surge in fundraising activities this year. Companies have raised over $16 billion to stockpile crypto assets, often inspired by the successful Bitcoin (BTC) treasury model of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy). Tokens associated with other blockchains, such as Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), have also seen significant price increases. These tokens were selected by major publicly traded companies in the US for their respective crypto-focused treasuries. Although AVAX has not experienced the same upward momentum, CoinGecko data shows that it has recorded gains of up to 17% in the weekly time frame. As of this writing, the AVAX price is approaching the key $30 mark, a level not seen since February of this year.

Valuations remain neutral, and our models indicate that the economy has entered a risk-recovery cycle. Having deployed ~15% cash and moderately raised portfolio beta, we believe the major overhang from tariff uncertainty and FII selling is largely behind us. Strong domestic macros—robust GDP growth, GST reforms, tax and rate cuts, low inflation, healthy liquidity, supportive DXY and bond yields, alongside peaked-out downgrades and mutual fund cash levels at 5–6%—all point to a firm base for Indian equities. While global risks persist, the improving US-India dialogue, stable domestic inflows, and improving factor spreads set the stage for a broad-based recovery over the next 12–18 months*.

More Info Investors in Saudi Aramco’s Jafurah natural gas project have approached a group of lenders to secure $10.3 billion in funding for the project. Jafurah is at the center of Saudi Arabia’s plans to develop its natural gas resources, diversifying from crude oil. With a price tag of a total $100 billion, the Jafurah development is described as the largest unconventional gas development outside the United States. Its reserves are estimated at some 229 trillion cu ft of natural gas plus 75 billion barrels of condensate. Production has been scheduled to start in the current quarter. According to Reuters, BlackRock, via Global Infrastructure Partners, is in talks with potential lenders interested in funding the project. These include JP Morgan and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, unnamed sources in the know told the publication. The source said BlackRock will contribute $1.8 billion of its own money to the total. According to Bloomberg, which also cited unnamed sources, the funding has already been secured. Per the Bloomberg sources, the funding package consists of a seven-year loan that could be refinanced on the bond market and a 19-year loan facility. In addition to the abovementioned banks, the banks involved in the loans also include Citi, Mitsubishi UFJ, and Mizuho. The news of the loan deal comes a month after Aramco sealed a deal with Blackrock’s Global Infrastructure Partners to invest $11 billion in a lease deal for Jafurah. Under the agreement, the BlackRock-led group will lease midstream facilities that serve Jafurah and then lease them back to Aramco for 20 years. The two set up a subsidiary company to manage the midstream facilities that BlackRock will lease, in which Aramco got 51% and BlackRock got 49%. Earlier in the year, Aramco also announced the signing of a slew of contracts for the Phase 2 development of Jafurah. The contracts’ total value was $12.4 billion, to involve the construction of gas compression facilities and associated pipelines, expansion of the Jafurah Gas Plant—including the construction of gas processing trains—and utilities, sulfur, and export facilities. Another $8.8 billion worth of contractual work was awarded to companies that will expand the project’s Master Gas System to boost its total capacity by an additional 3.15 billion standard cubic feet per day by 2028 through the installation of around 4,000 km (2,485 miles) of pipelines and 17 new gas compression trains. The billions have been piling up as Aramco moves the project closer to commercial production. While not known for being stingy, Saudi Arabia has clearly made a priority of developing its natural gas reserves and not a moment too soon, either. Despite attempts by the climate change activist lobby to discourage natural gas use due to emissions—natural gas demand has been on a strong and steady rise. The latest driver of this demand, of course, is the artificial intelligence race between IT giants that everyone in forecasting expects will fuel a veritable surge in electricity demand. Just this week, the Energy Information Administration reiterated its prediction that electricity consumption in the United States this year and next will hit a record high. America’s power use will hit 4,187 billion kilowatt-hours in 2025 and then rise to 4,305 billion kWh in 2026, according to the latest edition of the EIA’s Short-Term Energy Outlook. The previous record of 4,097 billion kWh was set in 2024. Gas demand is rising globally, too, opening up a growing market to Aramco, which plans to ramp up the country’s natural gas production by as much as 60% by 2030 from 2021 levels, when gas production stood at 10.1 billion cu ft, according to Aramco.

Title: LNG carbon bomb tops Carney’s list of major projects

Prime Minister Mark Carney hammers a few nails at a carpentry school before announcing five major projects as part of his plan for Canada to navigate changing trade relationships in Edmonton on Thursday September 11, 2025. Photo by: Amber Bracken / The Canadian Press A major carbon bomb sits atop Prime Minister Mark Carney’s first tranche of major projects, sparking backlash from environmental and Indigenous communities who say that doubling down on liquified natural gas is placing a dangerous bet on Canada’s future. The LNG Canada terminal in Kitimat, BC, is the primary way to export liquified natural gas (LNG) from the Montney Play. This region of British Columbia and Alberta is home to gas fields that, if fully tapped, would surpass Canada’s 2030 emissions targets 30 times over. It is a globally recognized “carbon bomb,” and LNG Canada Phase 2 — that doubles capacity at the site, making it the second largest facility of its kind in the world — was announced Thursday as a priority for Ottawa. The remaining projects include: The Darlington New Nuclear project in Ontario; The Port of Montreal’s Contrecœur terminal expansion in Quebec; McIlvenna Bay Foran Copper Mine project in Saskatchewan; Red Chris Mine expansion project in BC. Thursday’s announcement is a major step on a central campaign promise made by Carney to rapidly build major infrastructure. Speaking in Edmonton, he said the first batch of major projects would add $60 billion to the country’s economy. “For too long, when federal agencies have examined a project, their immediate question has been, ‘Why?’” Carney said. “From now on, Canada's new government starts by asking ourselves for major projects: How? How can we do it bigger? How can we do it faster?” Carney did not say how much federal financial support the companies building these projects would receive, but acknowledged projects would likely get some federal funding. Regardless, even by sending them to the newly launched Major Projects Office to help coordinate financing, public resources are being spent to push these projects over the finish line. The five projects Carney will now send to the Major Projects Office for review were already well under development, with some scheduled to begin operations next year. He acknowledged as much, noting that the first tranche of projects are owned by proponents who “have already done much of the hard work,” and “already meet many of the necessary regulatory standards.” In fact, government sources earlier told Canada’s National Observer that having the project already underway was one of two basic criteria used to choose the first round, making it easier for Ottawa to score political points for successfully completing it. The other was that the project is considered “stuck” in the regulatory process. “I'm not at all surprised they would pick projects that are already in the system,” said Martin Olszynski, an associate professor and chair of energy, resources and sustainability at the University of Calgary. “The idea is they'll be hustled the rest of the way.” At an estimated cost of $25 billion, LNG Canada Phase 2 is the largest in the first round of major projects. Environmental advocates and Indigenous leaders, key constituents and rights-holders who Carney has promised to respect, were quick to condemn it. Grand Chief Stewart Phillip, Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs president, said in a statement he was “gravely concerned” that the federal government is “deliberately” sidestepping its duty to consult First Nations. “Rather than being met with partnership, we are given an ultimatum: accept fossil fuel expansion or be pushed aside,” he said. “LNG Canada is not only a massive source of greenhouse gas emissions, but also drives destructive fracking, further threatening our lands, waters and communities — emissions do not recognize territorial boundaries. “We reject any process that tramples our inherent and constitutionally protected title and rights, ignores free, prior and informed consent, and sacrifices the climate for foreign corporate profits,” he added. LNG Canada’s owners are Shell, Mitsubishi, the Korea Gas Corporation, Petronas and PetroChina. An analysis from TD described Carney’s inclusion of LNG Canada Phase 2 as “superficial support,” because whether or not the project actually goes ahead depends on its owners. The bank said it would have liked to have seen the Ksi Lisims LNG and related Prince Rupert Gas Transmission Pipeline projects included to indicate federal support for the LNG sector. An analysis from Clean Energy Canada, published last year, estimates the greenhouse gas emissions from the already operating LNG Canada site are economically devastating. Doubling the export terminals capacity dramatically increases that harm. Specifically, the think tank found that the annual social cost of carbon — a widely used metric to approximate economic damages (such as health care costs) per tonne of greenhouse gas emissions — estimates $11.1 billion in damages by 2030 and annual costs of $14.8 billion by 2050. If Phase 2 were built, by 2050 the annual social cost of carbon emissions from the LNG Canada site soars to $29.6 billion. Over the project’s decades-long lifecycle, both phases of the project amount to nearly $1 trillion in damages — a supreme liability hanging over the country’s head, following the International Court of Justice’s finding this summer that countries could be held responsible for knowingly committing climate harm. Beyond its climate harm, forecasts suggest a global supply glut of LNG is looming, making new investments economically risky. “It's not in our national interest to increase our carbon emissions when we've had devastating fires year after year,” said Richard Brooks, climate finance director with Stand.earth. “They're exactly the opposite of what we should be doing.” Olszynski said he understands why many will be upset about LNG Canada Phase 2’s inclusion, but given the economic system we have, it’s not surprising to see it included. Even if risking “white elephants” — a term for major stranded assets — if banks are willing to invest, projects are likely to see those investment dollars flow. “There's the world that we want, and the world as it is,” he said. There’s a constant tension in market-based economies between planning for the future and market forces looking to profit in the short term. “There will always be forces pushing for more planning [and] for more logic, and then there will be those who push very strongly against them, and say that is contrary to market principles where the market will decide, that markets are efficient, and that markets will figure this out.” “(Former prime minister) Trudeau probably was prepared to tip the scales more towards planning [than] the current prime minister,” he said. Given the trade threats from the United States and push to diversify Canada’s trading partners, alongside the state of the Canadian economy as is, Carney “is saying I can't keep pissing those guys off — the folks who control the purse strings.” The Darlington nuclear project is a multi-billion dollar investment in small modular reactors. Once in operation, Carney said it would drive $500 million annually into Ontario’s nuclear supply chain and provide enough electricity to power 1.2 million homes. Ontario Power Generation was granted a licence earlier this year to begin construction. The two mining projects in the first tranche, the McIlvenna Bay copper mine in Saskatchewan and the Red Chris copper and gold mine in northwestern BC, Carney said would strengthen Canada’s position in the global critical minerals trade. The Red Chris copper mine, owned by Colorado-headquartered Newmont — whose majority shareholders include powerful US financial firms Vanguard Group, BlackRock, State Street and Van Eck Associates — has been fought by conservation groups and First Nations warning of risks to the environment. In a letter filed with the BC government, the SkeenaWild Conservation Trust warns the planned expansion will lead to sulphate, copper and selenium concentrations “exceeding” BC water quality guidelines. Similarly, a letter from the Central Council of the Tlingit & Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska says “we are alarmed by reports of ongoing seepage at the Red Chris site and the failure to contain contaminated surface waters.” “This is an urgent matter that demands enforcement action — not expansion,” the letter adds. Foran Mining Corporation — whose major shareholders include US-based Agnico Eagle Mines, Toronto-headquartered Fairfax Financial and the Public Sector Pension Investment Board — is developing the McIlvenna Bay Copper Mine in Saskatchewan. In recent years, the project has been protested by members of the Peter Ballantyne Cree Nation. The mining project threatens at-risk woodland caribou and 13 hectares of muskeg — valuable peatlands that absorb carbon dioxide from the air. Carney had previously teased that the Contrecœur expansion project at the Port of Montreal would make his list of major projects. The expansion, fought by environmentalists due to its impact on critical habitats for fish and frogs, involves a new container terminal to handle an additional 1.1 million containers per year, and was already planned and receiving cash from Quebec. It is scheduled to begin operations in 2029. Earlier this year, Xavier Barsalou-Duval, transportation, infrastructure and communities critic with the Bloc Québécois called on Carney to not include it as a project in the national interest. “A project of this magnitude should only proceed if it can be demonstrated that it can be carried out in strict compliance with existing environmental standards,” he said. “This burden, which falls to the Port of Montreal, must not be shirked or truncated by the Liberal government.” Carney said several other major projects are far from being ready, but are worth considering. He is asking the Major Projects Office to create business development teams to help advance them. The Major Projects Office will consider regulations, financing and supply chains for critical minerals, including in the priority areas of Ontario’s Ring of Fire, the Slave Geological Area in the Northwest Territories and in the Labrador Trough overlapping Québec and Labrador. The office will also study large-scale clean power with a focus on Nova Scotia’s proposed Wind West project. Carney said the offshore wind megaproject could generate one quarter of Canada’s entire electricity demand, and should be studied in tandem with the Energy East Partnership (a proposal to strengthen Atlantic Canada’s power grids) and the development of Gull Island being pursued by Québec and Newfoundland and Labrador. An “Arctic Economic and Security Corridor” will also be pursued, Carney said. The project would be anchored by a new port at Grays Bay in Nunavut, and include new roads and military capabilities. Upgrading the Port of Churchill will also be considered with plans to increase port capacity, rail lines, marine ice-breaking capabilities and an “energy corridor” to be studied, he said. The project would be developed with Manitoba’s Crown-Indigenous Corporation. Delivering on high-speed rail between Quebec City and Toronto is also a goal the Major Projects Office will study, with plans to be put in place within four years. Carney said the Major Projects Office will also help develop a “Canadian Sovereign Cloud,” to build computing capacity and data centres he framed as essential to economic competitiveness with artificial intelligence and quantum computing. The last major initiative the Major Projects Office will study promises to be controversial. The Pathways Alliance’s $16.5-billion proposal to pipe carbon dioxide captured from oilsands sites in northern Alberta to an underground storage site south of Cold Lake, will be considered. Carney dubbed the project “Pathways Plus” — with the plus being the possibility of a new oil pipeline being built, if the carbon capture megaproject is built. He framed the possibility as a way to strike a grand bargain as Alberta Premier Danielle Smith has called for, that could see “decarbonized oil” flow to new markets. As previously reported by Canada’s National Observer, “decarbonized oil” is not a credible term, leading climate scientists say. Carney said a second tranche of major projects to be referred to the Major Projects Office would be announced by Nov. 16. Geoffrey Pounder | September 11th 2025, 04:37 pm Carney: “For too long, when federal agencies have examined a project, their immediate question has been, ‘Why?’ From now on, Canada's new government starts by asking ourselves for major projects: How? How can we do it bigger? How can we do it faster?” Yes, let's not ask ourselves why or if we should build a project. Let's not ask ourselves whether a project is worth doing. Let's not conduct a cost-benefit analysis. Let's not identify and quantify the impacts of projects, singly and cumulatively. Let's just do it. Let's just go straight to figuring out how to build projects. Bigger and faster. In what world does that strategy make a lick of sense? In what world does failure to plan not lead to disaster? Cost overruns, delays, bad design, unforeseen consequences, not to mention local opposition? How is this good government? Geoffrey Pounder | September 11th 2025, 04:39 pm Article: "Environmental advocates and Indigenous leaders, key constituents and rights-holders who Carney has promised to respect, were quick to condemn it." Our trusty reporter fails to mention the not inconsiderable indigenous support for LNG: - Haisla Nation: A majority owner of the Cedar LNG project, partnering with Pembina Pipeline Corporation. - Nisg̱a'a Nation: A joint venture partner in the Ksi Lisims LNG project. - Gitxaala, Kitselas, Yekooche, and Stellat'en First Nations have signed benefits agreements related to LNG development. - Gitxsan Nation: Supports the natural gas pipeline that would supply the Ksi Lisims LNG project. Some indigenous communities see fossil-fuel "development" as their path out of decades of poverty. To what extent indigenous support is coerced is another question. If they do not have the right to say NO, their YES does not mean much. Alex Botta | September 12th 2025, 01:07 pm In reply to Article: "Environmental… by Geoffrey Pounder Yes, there is Indigenous support for LNG. There are are also Indigenous opponents, and that has caused a division among and within First Nations. Those who have an equity stake will enjoy significant revenue up to what ever ceiling evolves, perhaps less than the original hype due to cost overruns during the construction of supply infrastructure meeting a supply glut and undercutting international competition. Or perhaps a longer run of returns into the mid-2030s out to 2040 where a peak in demand is looming. Either way, support among BC's First Nations for LNG, as mixed as it is, will never in a million years be reflected in another Northern Gateway pipeline proposal carrying diluted bitumen. Roy Brander | September 12th 2025, 09:08 am It's a mistake to think Carney has that much agency. His votes were a frankly unnatural reverse of what was going to happen, last election. It could flip back any time if he is seen as "weak". (Biden didn't fall because he sounded senile; Trump has sounded senile for years. Biden's sin was to appear weak.) The (insane, but real) prevailing belief is that traditional solutions are "strong" and new, untried technologies are "weak". Those who remember PCs vs Mainframes in 1980s corporations recall when that was the dynamic for IT. The LNG expansion is the hardest proposal to fight, because it leverages the sunk cost of the existing plant, the site and the foundations and pipes and powerlines to it. It's the smallest concession he could make, frankly. And climate activists should have a little confidence that the new technologies are not weak, and that their strength will be quite obvious to all, not just to experts, in five more years. By the time this expansion is built, there will be no calls for more. Alex Botta | September 13th 2025, 01:25 am In reply to It's a mistake to think… by Roy Brander "By the time this expansion is built, there will be no calls for more." I certainly hope you're right. Proponents calling for more are a dime a dozen. The real test will be finding proponents who are willing to risk their own resources to built more by assuming the majority of the costs. There are a few who are big on LNG, hoping for a few years of profitable revenue even with the mounting evidence of a glut and powerful competition from international producers with lower priced product, but none who have presented a business case for more oil pipelines. Danielle Smith seems to think the federal government should build more oil pipelines, including a million-barrel a day monster to Prince Rupert, if private investors don't take the majority of the risk. Fat chance. Even with Hodgson leading the way federally, Canadians will not accept funnelling hundreds of billions into pipelines while social programs are put under threat. However, there is an alternative: Smith can put Alberta into the position of assuming the majority of the financial risk, and as the main proponent, Alberta will be the central figure caught in the middle of court battles brought on by First Nations that pitch C-5 against the Constitution, and in diminishing demand for heavy liquid petroleum in China, the current leading market demand entity in Asia. Refined oil products for road transportation have already peaked in China. Smith can deny demand destruction "theories" all she wants, but China's consumption peak in gasoline is a fact, not a theory, as is China's increasing influence on electrification and renewables in Asia and the Global South. Until Smith puts up $50+B of Albertan's money and debt risk for new pipelines, we know her continuing rhetoric goading the feds and cavalierly dismissing the critics amounts to nothing but political theatre. Roy Brander | September 13th 2025, 08:46 am In reply to "By the time this expansion… by Alex Botta You have to read the industry news, not the regular news. Try this news, just this morning: https://cleantechnica.com/2025/09/12/fossil-demand-decline-in-india-chi… ...the investors for this very expansion may get cold feet in a year or two, early enough to pull out the rug. I suspect a big part of the "go, go, go" attitude is because they know the end is coming, and imagine they can get public money to "de-risk" it. So I sneeringly say that all approvals are a done deal, as long as it's all private money, a double-dog dare. Big investors can see we passed mere inflection points a few years back, and now the actual turning points are imminent and inescapable. The Trump administration is pushing back a tide with a pitchfork. Their wish is to sell a vital supply to those who have little choice. China and India were counted upon as certain importers, and "energy dominance" was about playing the same role to them that Saudis played for America and Europe through the 70s. Oddly enough: China and India don't like their role in that story, and have found ways around it. As those technologies prove themselves, and get more investment, the tide is going to undercut the sand the fossil investments are built upon. Tris Pargeter | September 12th 2025, 11:07 am Martin Olszynski is right; he sees the POLITICAL realities that unfortunately but absolutely NECESSARILY preclude the full-scale climate change action required, a situation that is also very much mirrored in Europe right now, making Carney's unprecedented effort to turn away from the States and toward the EU the most important message. Ultimately, that involves OUR economy as it IS, banks and big corporations very much included, unfortunately. So for all the purists and activists who are currently threatening what political capital progressives currently HAVE, barely but most fortuitously wrested away from the cons, again I point out that you are ALL becoming part of the problem, heroic though you claim to be. For many of you, I quote Falstaff who said "honor is a mere scutcheon," and for many more I'd say wake up and smell the coffee because this is as good as it gets UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, which we ALL are, always. The Liberals are also forming an environmental caucus for us all, proof of why they are the only rational choice and we're lucky to have them AND Carney, period. He summed up the situation recently when a reporter questioned his choice of an adviser who was involved with the tobacco industry by pointing out that last time he checked that although he doesn't approve of any of it, there IS a tobacco industry and it is NOT illegal to smoke. The same can unfortunately still be said for the fossil fuel industry, but people still need to heat their homes and drive their cars to work. Because the stakes are much higher, in fact couldn't be higher, all the more reason we need unusually adroit leadership, which we fortunately HAVE. Paul Berger | September 12th 2025, 09:13 pm In reply to Martin Olszynski is right;… by Tris Pargeter Causing the immense suffering of others may be slightly better than causing very immense suffering, but that's a very low bar. We would be fortunate if the Liberals had been climate leaders in any real sense in the last decade. No matter what Carney does, he's already lost in sending the message, consistent with JT, that we're not in a climate emergency. For shame. Tris Pargeter | September 13th 2025, 07:55 am In reply to Causing the immense… by Paul Berger Yes, but that is STILL where the bar IS is my point. How do you not see what is happening right now when it's MATH? Scaring people has clearly sent a substantial number of them toward the conservatives, who comfortably deny climate change, pathetic, surprising, and irrational though that IS. Emily Dickinson said it best, "Tell the truth, but tell it slant." And again, we BARELY won the last election, so my other point is that your right but too "righteous" NDP cohort shares a refusal to accept reality with the conservatives, making you very much part of the problem. The voting public already told you that; your party just refuses to listen, blaming the Liberals, AGAIN, like the conservatives. I'm worried your seven MP's will remain petulant and vote against the budget, thereby voting against their and ALL of our best interests at this point in time, AGAIN, like the conservatives.

Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock explores tokenizing exchange-traded fund (ETF) shares as part of its push to expand its digital asset infrastructure beyond traditional market boundaries. As Bloomberg News reported on Sept. 11, the firm weighs creating blockchain-based versions of ETFs tied to real-world assets (RWA), including stocks, according to sources familiar with the confidential planning. The initiative builds on BlackRock’s $2.2 billion BUIDL tokenized money-market fund, launched in March 2024, two months after the debut of its Bitcoin ETF. CEO Larry Fink previously stated that every financial asset can be tokenized, most recently reiterating it in his 2025 annual letter to investors. Tokenized ETF shares would enable trading beyond Wall Street’s standard hours, improve international access to US products, and create new collateral opportunities within crypto networks. The report comes in the same week as Nasdaq filed with the SEC to trade tokenized stocks and ETFs on its platform. BlackRock has tested tokenized fund shares through JPMorgan’s Kinexys infrastructure and positioned itself as an early adopter of digital settlement models.

Excluding private credit, tokenized money funds are the largest RWA category, with a $7.4 billion market cap as of Sept. 11. At the same time, ETFs offer broader asset exposure and trading mechanics that are well-suited for blockchain deployment. Exchanges including Kraken, Robinhood, and Coinbase already offer tokenized stocks internationally or plan to do so. However, the report noted that current challenges include reconciling ETF settlement through Wall Street clearinghouses with blockchain’s instant, 24-hour trading capabilities. These challenges create technical and regulatory questions for custodians managing the transition between traditional and digital infrastructure. BlackRock’s exploration reflects mainstream finance’s evaluation of blockchain technology for enhancing market infrastructure, including improvements in collateral flows and settlement speed. The firm’s digital asset advocacy, combined with regulatory shifts, positions tokenized ETFs as another bridge between traditional and decentralized finance systems.

BlackRock is exploring how to bring exchange-traded funds (ETFs) onto public blockchains, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. The sources said the asset manager is weighing tokenizing funds tied to real-world assets such as stocks, though any rollout would depend on regulatory approval. The discussions follow BlackRock’s first experiment with tokenization last year. The firm introduced the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, also known as BUIDL. The fund, which is backed by short-term U.S. Treasuries, repurchase agreements and cash, has quickly grown into the world’s largest tokenized Treasury product, managing nearly $2.2 billion. Tokenizing ETFs would represent a deeper step into blockchain-based financial products. In practice, it would mean that shares of the funds — traditionally traded on stock exchanges during market hours — could be issued and transacted as tokens on chain. Proponents argue this shift could bring clear benefits. A tokenized ETF could be traded around the clock, rather than only during exchange hours. Settlement, which often takes two business days in traditional finance, could be completed within minutes. Investors in markets where ETFs are not easily accessible might gain exposure through blockchain rails. The products are pending a green light from regulators, the people said. BlackRock’s exploration underscores a wider trend across finance, as banks, fintechs and asset managers test blockchain rails for bonds, private credit and now mainstream equity funds.

Title: If There Is No Welfare State, What Will Europe’s Social Contract Be?
URL: https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2025/09/if-there-is-no-welfare-state-what-will-europes-social-contract-be.html
Time Published: 2025-09-11T18:00:46Z
Full Content:
The underlying social contract between individuals and the state in Western European nations over the last hundred years has been that the state would grow to regulate and tax virtually every sphere of life—public or private—in exchange for a measure of order and comfort for its citizens. If the state begins to reduce those comforts as order starts disintegrating, but continues to grow and to tax even more, it could be interpreted as a breach of the terms of the agreement. As I was finishing this article, France’s youngest citizens took to the streets to defend the welfare state under the banner of the “Block Everything” movement. Their demands include greater investment in public health and education, rent controls, retirement at 60, and stronger environmental policies. Protesters have erected barricades, blocked highways and public-transport stations, in an effort to bring the country to a standstill. More than 400 people were arrested. The demonstrations erupted after President Macron appointed Sébastien Lecornu as prime minister, a move widely seen as signaling the continuation of his predecessor’s austerity policies. These protests underscore the central argument of this article: the welfare state is the social contract that binds Western European citizens to their governments. When those benefits are eroded, many view it as a breach of that contract—one that, in their eyes, justifies civil disobedience. Friedrich Merz, often dubbed Germany’s “BlackRock” chancellor, has already indicated that there has to be a reduction in state benefits: “The welfare state as we know it today is no longer economically sustainable with what we are producing as a national economy.” That the welfare state suffers from a viability problem is not news. What is news is that the head of the largest economy in the eurozone, with a relatively low debt-to-GDP ratio (~65%), is publicly preparing citizens for a rollback of state benefits. But Germany is not alone in this conundrum. France’s government, the second-largest economy in the eurozone, with a much higher debt-to-GDP ratio (~119%), has lost a confidence vote in parliament and been dissolved over a budget that slashes public spending. According to deposed Prime Minister François Bayrou, nearly €44 billion in cuts is necessary because, he argues, France has not balanced its budget for roughly 50 years. The economy is expected to grow by no more than 0.6% in 2025, with a public deficit of about 6%. Some have even floated the prospect of an IMF bailout. Another European nation that might need an IMF bailout—perhaps even more urgently than France—is the UK. The UK’s debt is becoming significantly more expensive to service due to a sharp rise in borrowing costs, which now amount to over £100 billion annually—nearly 10% of the national budget. This comes despite decades of mass privatization of social services. According to many economists, both France and the UK are going downhill in slow motion toward a debt crisis. The Wall Street Journal, of course, has no doubt why this is happening: “Britain and France aren’t illiquid. They’re insolvent. Their future spending commitments, primarily in the form of expected social-welfare and old-age benefit payouts, far exceed any realistic estimate of the economic growth that will be available to pay those bills.” Other European nations, such as Spain—whose GDP is expected to grow around 2.5% in 2025—will face a very similar problem with their welfare systems. Spain’s debt-to-GDP ratio is around 100% (compared to Germany’s ~65%), but its share of the budget devoted to social services is almost identical. Spain’s current growth is predicated on a general increase in the money supply and a relatively successful immigration strategy over the last two decades. The immigrant population has gone from 3.5 million in 2005 to 7 million in 2025. This has contributed to lower GDP per capita, which is why many Spaniards have barely felt the macroeconomic growth. Despite immigration, the birth rate in Spain is among the lowest in Europe (1.12, lower than Germany, France, and the UK), which makes the long-term sustainability of the welfare state questionable under the logic that it is the current workforce that pays for it. The case for slashing public spending is usually the same: slower economic growth and a smaller workforce reduce the state’s revenues, while the aging population continues to grow and unemployment rises due to slower economic growth. This discourse presents budget cuts as almost inevitable and frames “slower economic growth” as a natural phenomenon, almost like a drought, occurring outside the control of politicians. That it is outside the control of politicians—who have limited control over financial policy—might be correct for the most part. However, to present it as a natural phenomenon implies assuming that markets operate under objective natural forces, like gravity, unaffected by the actors involved. That is simply not the case. The “markets” respond to the actions of individuals and companies. A case in point is the 2008 crash, which was brought about by a set of specific practices, such as the sale of mortgage derivatives, which were known—at least by some—to be fraudulent and to potentially cause the collapse of the entire system. The 2008 crisis is a good example because the financial crisis engineered by big financiers, with or without knowledge, was ultimately paid for by ordinary citizens, and virtually no one was held accountable. It will again be ordinary citizens who pay the price of the geopolitical crisis that now affects Europe with the war in Ukraine. The conflict has unleashed war momentum against the interests of most European citizens, both economically and existentially, which could have been avoided or at least settled early on. Its effects are now precipitating a collapse of European economies and societies. It is not that Europe did not have structural problems before—such as severe demographic decline, chronic underinvestment in digital technologies, a fiscal sustainability problem, or the loss of national sovereignty to an unelected bureaucratic class—but with the war in Ukraine, all these issues have become more pronounced. These problems have been compounded by the loss of cheap energy supplies from Russia—which were a lifeline to both industry and individuals—and the Trump administration’s demand that Europe foot the bill for the war in Ukraine and pay back the U.S. for years of supposedly favorable trade terms. While Merz warns Germans that they should be ready to see cuts in public spending, he continues to support Ukraine with €9 billion this year and has changed the country’s debt rules, which will skyrocket the debt-to-GDP ratio. According to a recent interview, he claimed that if he had not done so, the “NATO alliance would have disintegrated in June.” NATO member states, compelled at Trump’s behest to raise defense spending to 5% of GDP, will necessarily see cuts in public spending to offset this defense rise. Germany, France, and the UK are leading European support for Ukraine, promising to give Ukraine €100 billion to buy arms from the U.S. To this spending on Ukraine must be added the “Rearm Europe” plan, which, as Conor Gallagher very aptly argues, will result in armies ill-equipped to face Russia’s forces but well suited to face Europe’s own citizens: “Defense spending by EU member states is now projected to reach 381 billion euros this year, up over last year’s record of 343 billion. Despite all the money being burned at the altar of Project Ukraine, sober analysts conclude that European nations are woefully ill-equipped to successfully do much of any fighting there, and no amount of money is going to change that for the foreseeable future (…) But all the additional weaponry and surveillance goodies that aren’t immediately tossed into the corrupt pit of death that is Ukraine could be more likely to be used on an increasingly discontented population rather than against Russia. We’re already seeing it happen.” No wonder many Europeans are discontent when they are told that the basic underlying logic of their relationship with the state—the social contract embodied in the welfare state—has changed, yet they are unable to exit the contract. They are told there is no money for education, healthcare, or pensions, yet there appears to be an unending flow of money for weapons and war—a war that does not seem to be in the interests of most European citizens. The sovereignty of modern nation-states, which are paradigmatic European creations, rests on the assumption that the state embodies the “will of the people.” The somewhat abstract concept of “will to representation” is converted into “sovereign will” and vested in the “state.” This presupposes that the role of the state and the state bureaucracy is to safeguard the interests of its citizens. In Europe, the rise of the welfare state dates back to the end of the First World War. But it was really after the Second World War, in a Europe destroyed and impoverished, that the Western European states, with the help of the Marshall Plan, began developing a new social model. The war had left Europe ideologically and morally dead, so rather than ideals or morals, the state offered comfort and security in exchange for obedience and taxes. This model seemed to work and offered a compromise—a European way—between the capitalist model of the U.S. and the communist one of the Soviet Union. Although some of this is true, the success of the model was predicated on and expanded through the economic preeminence of Western Europe allied to the U.S.—some would say a vassal—especially after the fall of the Soviet Union. Parallel to, and as a consequence of, the rise of the welfare system was the growth of the state and the ever-increasing tax burden on its citizens. Starting in the 1960s, to finance the state, the value-added tax was implemented—first in France and later throughout Europe. The justification for this new tax was that the state needed the funds to finance welfare benefits. Europeans accepted this and other substantial tax increases, as well as sweeping new laws and regulations, afraid of returning to a pre-war scenario and comfortable with state benefits. So much so that, in Europe, “the state” has become almost synonymous with “the welfare state.” This logic—Europe’s underlying social contract—has held Western European society together. Though not without critique, it was widely accepted. When François Bayrou proposed the €44 billion cut to social services that ended his government, both the right and the left voted against it. In France, where society is currently extremely polarized, this is not a minor detail but a significant indicator. The protests that have erupted in defense of the welfare state—on which both left and right are trying to capitalize—are further proof. The current push for costly military readiness and arms spending seems to go against the logic of the welfare state, which is to say, against the interests of ordinary Europeans, thus changing the state’s side of the social contract. Now the state offers security and protection, not order and welfare, and asks more—not less—of citizens. That logic, in turn, requires new threats and enemies—and the launching of new wars. This happens because the state is, economically and ideologically, bankrupt. This is not an anomaly but a feature of this model of state sovereignty as now embodied in the European Union. If the state embodies the “will of the people,” then the goal of the state, conceived as an expression of sovereign will, has to be nothing more than its perpetual existence. “It is not an end among others; it is that end for which all others can be sacrificed,” writes Paul W. Kahn in Putting Liberalism in Its Place. Well with people like Kaja Kallas, they will go from fighting Russia to the last Ukrainian to fighting Russia to the last European. Seems like a natural progression. Those living in democratic Western nations have always had the opportunity to oppose military buildups in preparation for war with Russia. Yet, they chose not to. If they end up living in hunger and poverty, they will only have themselves to blame. >>>If they end up living in hunger and poverty, they will only have themselves to blame. Just like us Americans who despite keeping voting for change keep getting shafted by both the Democrats and the Republicans? I don’t know much about European politics, but I think that European politics, just like American politics, is rigged to favor the oligarchs and the politicians who serve them. Sadly, in the UK we have lived under an increasingly party-based authoritarian liberal oligarchy dressed with a rapidly fading and shrinking tinsel of electoral democracy wrapped around it. The BBC, funded by every license holder, lies, both by commission and omission, as does the MSM and the channels the MSM supports on Youtube, &c (no, the Times and Telegraph channels may sound like derivatives of ‘Round the Horne’ but, alas, they are not). The UK is not very different from other European countries which seem to be responding in similar ways by supporting new parties which wish to cast aside many of the constraints imposed by tradition and more recent custom and practice. We Brits have attempted to control HMG’s willingness to go down to defeat in wars the USA has embroiled us from Korea, by acts of civil disobedience and political demonstrations, through the Cruise missile crisis and the wonderful women of Greenham Common, the vicious war against civil rights activists in Ulster, the destruction of Serbia’s territorial integrity, the illegal invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, the overthrow and murder of Gadaffi and other leaders in North and sub-Saharan Africa, and the murderous regime put in place by the US and British Ukrainian coup and the subsequent conflict over Russian civil rights in the Donbass leading to the SMO. Sadly, none of our efforts worked. So the only option is to support completely new parties and to clean house even more thoroughly than Cromwell did. The real choice at the next election will be between Reform and Your Party. The same process is occurring or has occurred in countries on the European mainland and it looks as if many governments are more than prepared to go to war against their own people to maintain the privileges of the politcal and financial élite. The British have been prepared to give their lives for liberty in the past and will do so again. And this is true of every European nation. Our future is one of economic decline unless we come to terms with the emerging new world order and this pressure will only intensify the movement towards the most unLampedusa-like changes in the body politic. Is there any possibility that a potential future target of the new European militarism might be to the south of the continent, across the sea? A second prize of resources, if first prize (Russia) doesn’t pan out? European entities seem to devolve toward the principle of following the will of the right people. Elitism can take many forms, from directing the lower orders to getting exclusive access to perks. More transparency showing the hidden levers and accounts would be a start toward citizen understanding. Who pushes so hard for weaponry and war, and why? And how do a few individuals get to cause so many problems? Looking at BoJo, for one. Who wants country welfare programs to be overwhelmed by migrants, political, economic or otherwise? It looks like a real race to the end is looming in Europe. Who will be killed off first? The destructor propagators of mass death – Leyen Kallas Rutte Merz Macron Starmer et al Or millions of individuals among the people of Europe, some of whom are slowly coming to realise what trap is being set up for them. People in all of Europe – Germans, Spaniards, Serbs, Italians, Poles, Brits. Everyone. The financial data suggest the OK Coral is a low single digits of years away. Scary. The European welfare state, along with Social Security and other programs in the US, was created in part to keep those filthy commies at bay, not out of the goodness of the elite heart. Once there was no more USSR to worry about…. I don’t think it’s a coincidence the concrete material benefits for citizens have been on the decline while the wealth disparity has increased drastically for the last 40 years or so. Nazis, the West is fine with – many Western countries gladly invited them in after hostilities were over. It’s the sharing bit that just can’t be tolerated. This is simply not true about the experience of Western Europe. Most Western European states had some form of welfare system in place by the inter-war years not least because of trades union pressure and the need to support the dependents of the lost male population during the Great War. Bismark created the German welfare state as part of his effort to ensure the unification of Germany and to provide a secure basis for German industrial workers and soldiers – and it worked, and the rest of us followed in Germany’s wake. But something else happened during The Great War–something in Russia. Surely this had an effect on how European governments treated the working class. Then when that thing was finally defeated ideologically Thatcher could proclaim “there is no alternative.” Which is not to argue that political ideas control history but rather to agree with Stephen Douglas that “power concedes nothing without a demand.” The Russian Revolution was that demand scared the Euro aristocracy mightily. Some effect, maybe. The move towards the welfare state in Europe began before that, however (1880s in Germany, 1900s in Britain… I think most European countries started introducing key elements of modern welfare systems like old age pension schemes, somewhere in 1880-1910s; the only one I can find quickly that could conceivably be blamed on us is Italy, 1919 – there are many other examples outside of Europe, and there things may have been different). It was influenced in large part by domestic “demand”, or by the desire to stave off their own socialist and unionist movements, but there were other considerations as well: inter-European competition; wanting to keep the race in shape to keep down the colonial populations; even, though you may dismiss that, Christian paternalism, patriotism and/or social progressivism as elements of elite ideology and self-image. The Great October Socialist Revolution/October coup did influence later development to some extent, but it merely reinforced preexisting trends. I am not sure if its influence was always a helpful one for this, for that matter – it also helped start a powerful right-wing backlash that did not compare to what existed before the war. And I’d say it’s also an example of how ideas do control history – if people in and out of power had not conceived of such reforms, no one would have enacted them. The development of the welfare states of Europe can be traced well back to the mid-19th Century at least – they were arguably the result of the weakening of religion and the strengthening of the secular state, but you can trace its origins well back to medieval times – many towns and cities has surprisingly sophisticated social systems designed to protect the poorest organised by various forms of town governance (councils/guilds,etc). The motives were the usual complex mix of compassion, religious belief, social pressure, ideology and fear. They long predate any fear of socialism, although not of course fear of peasant uprisings. Later northern European welfare systems, developed as private companies became larger and more influential and developed their own health/welfare systems (often, of course, under trade union pressure), and these in time became generalised by the State in order to iron out social pressures between those protected by those corporate systems and those (not necessarily poor) on the outside. The complexity of the history is one reason why these systems are so complex (a health economist friend was fond of joking that there are only about 3 people alive who understand how the Dutch health system works) and have roots that go well beyond the notional ‘start’ of any particular scheme. Its also a key reason as to why there are so many deep differences between their design and implementation across Europe. Even between quite ‘similar’ countries – such as Denmark and Sweden – there are often very fundamental differences in both the background politics and the nuts and bolts of implementation of these systems. For the most part, they work surprisingly well, despite several decades of attacks by neoliberals (even Thatcher feared tackling the NHS). The key threat, as the article alludes – is that the pension/care systems are for the most part based on assumptions of rising population/economic growth which no longer hold. This is, in my opinion, a key reason why domestic politicians have been so reluctant to tackle immigration. The projections are horrible if you rely on domestic fertility – but this applies now all over the developed and intermediately developed world. Its a nettle that has yet to be firmly grasped by any country. Oh, of course – I specifically meant the comparatively standardised and systematic modern welfare systems as pioneered by Bismarck or Lloyd George, but depending on one’s definitions, some forms of state (or, more often, municipal?) welfare existed for centuries or indeed for as long as human civilisation. Standardised welfare of the Bismarck type is, to my knowledge, a 19th century European novelty; so is the ideologically-driven rejection of state welfare, though indeed, even such fanatics as Thatcher had a healthy fear of going too far in attacking what people had come to rely on. ” Stephen” Douglas? Surely you mean Frederick Douglas. Yes sorry for the senior moment. And to the other replies to my comment I’ll just point out that the Russian revolution was preceded by others in Europe and perhaps most importantly our own which rejected a king (coming soon as Ken Burns PBS doc). I think the statement made by Frederick Douglas is to the point and that point is that those at the pinnacle of power do not back down other than from the threat of violence since violence is how they maintain their position. Even in enlightened 19th century Britain (paging Dickens) you could still be drawn and quartered. Of course democracy is supposed to provide another path which is why they are doing so much to undermine it. There are a lot of problems here, and a lot of misguided prejudices (I am not refering to the article, but about common knowledge). Europe, except the USSR, the last European power, was done in 1945. It was pretty clear in the Suez crisis. Yes, they were important countries in a slow decline, but decline. EEC-EU-Europe, or Euroamerica, is a marginal side of the US hegemonic system. The EEC was a optimizing system for the main economies of Western Europe, it was never designed for advanced but small countries like Sweden, Switzerland or Austria, not at all for undeveloped like Greece, Spain, Portugal, let alone ex-COMECON and the lot, not even the fiasco of a United Germany. It became a chaos. It was a economic device, not even a political one, the Paris-Berlin axis was a mirage (because of German partition), it lasted until 1990s, UK was ever a disloyal member, and the like. The political device was, and is, NATO, all the powerful countries of the EU are nothing without it, and the traction of NATO was to make the EU as similar to the US as possible as fast as possible. The welfare state was a concession by fear of the Soviet Union, which exists no more. There is no reason not to carry the EU to the same social welfare standards of the US, which is what is happening. Corruption is massive, as ever was, so if we don’t see things from this point of view, we hardly understand anything. Taxes are lower than ever, in the sense that they are not extracting money where it is, in fact they collect less and less in a suicidal temptative to keep alive the system. If things were that far away without resistance, it’s more than dubious they are going to change in the next few years. Firstly, people must be aware about reality, not the bubble where they forced to live, and only after that, something could happen. Or not. All these comments are well and good, but of course, the interesting part is the question of what Putin’s motivations are. Is the attack on Poland because of internal failures in Russia, or are their other reasons? Putin obviously has his eyes on Latvia and Estonia, where a goodly portion of the population is Russian. One would have thought that they would be easier anti-Nato targets. There is obviously a ‘message’ here. Poland has historically been vulnerable because it is flat, and a convenient invasion corridor. Back in the day, when the European militaries worried about mass invasions by tanks, that made sense. Mutandis mutandi, it’s a drone’s world now. And it’s not like Israel, which gets its military weapons free, courtesy of ‘foreign aid’ from the US. Putin has to pay for all the Iranian drones and missles as well as domestic arms production. Has something changed internally that makes expansion of hostilities desirable? I’m sure the there’s ‘less here than meets the eye’, but being merely a slightly astute citizen myself, I can’t suss it out. Was there even an attack on Poland? Even that badic premise remains unclear. One might as well ask what the Poles were thinking at Gleiwitz, 1939. Ukraine did hack Russia drones, then send them through Belarus. Belarus even warned Poland about the drones. Fun fact. The drones that entered Poland did not have the range to reach there if launched from Russian positions. It was too far as the Russians pointed out. So either they were taken there by magical tailwinds that no weather report shows or else these were captured drones that were launched by Zelensky to bring Poland and NATO into the fighting. I’m going with Door Number Two. UK media has commented that they were launched from Belarus. Reports from Belarus said that they had a few enter their airspace which were shot down so gave Poland a heads up that they might have a few come their way. As for UK media, they are on par with Oz media or German media which is not a high bar. Some Brits say that the BBC actually stands for the British Bull******* Corporation as an example. Bad Old debating Technique- answering a question with a question. Maybe they were just playing questions- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3xIs0aajN4 “The underlying social contract between individuals and the state in Western European nations over the last hundred years has been that the state would grow to regulate and tax virtually every sphere of life—public or private—in exchange for a measure of order and comfort for its citizens…” Even though the final para states “This is not an anomaly but a feature of this model of state sovereignty as now embodied in the European Union. ..” the author doesn’t appear to acknowledge that the underlying European social contract between individuals and the nation state was effectively broken with the adoption of the financially unfederated Brussels governed administered common currency structure of European Union 26 yrs ago. The individual nation states in adopting the Euro surrendered their capacity to deliver on that social contract to unelected administrators in Brussels. Each Eurozone member state in abandoning their national currency, gave up their fiscal sovereignty to adopt the Euro – effectively a foreign issued currency. Together with accepting an arbitrarily Brussels enforced annual 3% fiscal deficit limit it was inevitable that expanded state monetary needs for industry/population growth would eat into the available funds necessary to deliver on that social contract. The US, itself a nation of 50 fully financially federated states, knew full well the implications of that structure – a stealthy ploy to slowly but surely destroy European socialism. IMHO a structure designed to keep Europe down, socially divided with vassalised financial elites in firm, ever growing control. An article worth re-reading (after 13 yrs) by Greg Palas is ‘Robert Mundell, evil genius of the euro.’ See also William Mitchell’s Eurozone Dystopia: Groupthink and Denial on a Grand Scale https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/30343868-eurozone-dystopia and Mitchell and Fazi’s Reclaiming the State: A Progressive Vision of Sovereignty for a Post-Neoliberal World https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/36426386-reclaiming-the-state Any residual social contract in the UK was erased from 1980 when unemployment first hit 2m down to the Thatcherite dogma that unemployment was “a price worth paying”. The loss of trust in the political class during deindustrialisation, and social insecurity, has led to the rise of right wing populist insurgents preying on disaffection. Any of the European nations which has experienced youth unemployment over 20% and poor real wage increases over the last few decades is likely to have the same social insecurity. I agree. The state demands you obey the laws, keep the peace, respect your fellow citizens. In other words, to put the common good before your individual good. In return the state must give you the opportunity to thrive within those constraints. If it doesn’t all bets are off. “Another European nation that might need an IMF bailout—perhaps even more urgently than France—is the UK. The UK’s debt is becoming significantly more expensive to service due to a sharp rise in borrowing costs, which now amount to over £100 billion annually—nearly 10% of the national budget…” The UK does not need an IMF bailout – The UK is the sole fully sovereign issuer of the UK£. It can pay any debt it incurs denominated in the UK£. When will journalists ever spend the time researching how National monetary systems actually function? In a democracy with well informed citizens then the choice between having billionaires or having a social safety net would be easy. As is then I’d say that either the citizens aren’t well-informed and we have democracy or we don’t have democracy and what we do have is oligarchy. A subtle choice of words can be used when engaging in propaganda. The difference in outcome between asking if people want a welfare state or if they want a social safety net is (at least in my strong belief) huge. I believe that as long as the ‘opposition’ to the status quo are using phrases suggested by supporters of the status quo then the ‘opposition’ will not drive any change. Not sure about this: chronic underinvestment in digital technologies . It wasn’t explained and I am not sure what is being referred to. Bacchunin observes further upthread, “Taxes are lower than ever, in the sense that they are not extracting money where it is.” Setting aside for the moment the MMT realities of fiat money (since Eurozone constituent states aren’t individually monetarily sovereign, having foolishly given that implement of sovereignty away in Maastricht) it ought to be obvious to anyone who can read a balance sheet that somebody owns all of the debt which makes these countries “insolvent.” Yet the press never makes the connection between rising inequality, the ever growing number of billionaires and state “insolvency.” It’s almost like rich people own the media … 🤨 Your email address will not be published.

The underlying social contract between individuals and the state in Western European nations over the last hundred years has been that the state would grow to regulate and tax virtually every sphere of life—public or private—in exchange for a measure of order and comfort for its citizens. If the state begins to reduce those comforts as order starts disintegrating, but continues to grow and to tax even more, it could be interpreted as a breach of the terms of the agreement. As I was finishing this article, France’s youngest citizens took to the streets to defend the welfare state under the banner of the “Block Everything” movement. Their demands include greater investment in public health and education, rent controls, retirement at 60, and stronger environmental policies. Protesters have erected barricades, blocked highways and public-transport stations, in an effort to bring the country to a standstill. More than 400 people were arrested. The demonstrations erupted after President Macron appointed Sébastien Lecornu as prime minister, a move widely seen as signaling the continuation of his predecessor’s austerity policies. These protests underscore the central argument of this article: the welfare state is the social contract that binds Western European citizens to their governments. When those benefits are eroded, many view it as a breach of that contract—one that, in their eyes, justifies civil disobedience. Friedrich Merz, often dubbed Germany’s “BlackRock” chancellor, has already indicated that there has to be a reduction in state benefits: “The welfare state as we know it today is no longer economically sustainable with what we are producing as a national economy.” That the welfare state suffers from a viability problem is not news. What is news is that the head of the largest economy in the eurozone, with a relatively low debt-to-GDP ratio (~65%), is publicly preparing citizens for a rollback of state benefits. But Germany is not alone in this conundrum. France’s government, the second-largest economy in the eurozone, with a much higher debt-to-GDP ratio (~119%), has lost a confidence vote in parliament and been dissolved over a budget that slashes public spending. According to deposed Prime Minister François Bayrou, nearly €44 billion in cuts is necessary because, he argues, France has not balanced its budget for roughly 50 years. The economy is expected to grow by no more than 0.6% in 2025, with a public deficit of about 6%. Some have even floated the prospect of an IMF bailout. Another European nation that might need an IMF bailout—perhaps even more urgently than France—is the UK. The UK’s debt is becoming significantly more expensive to service due to a sharp rise in borrowing costs, which now amount to over £100 billion annually—nearly 10% of the national budget. This comes despite decades of mass privatization of social services. According to many economists, both France and the UK are going downhill in slow motion toward a debt crisis. The Wall Street Journal, of course, has no doubt why this is happening: “Britain and France aren’t illiquid. They’re insolvent. Their future spending commitments, primarily in the form of expected social-welfare and old-age benefit payouts, far exceed any realistic estimate of the economic growth that will be available to pay those bills.” Other European nations, such as Spain—whose GDP is expected to grow around 2.5% in 2025—will face a very similar problem with their welfare systems. Spain’s debt-to-GDP ratio is around 100% (compared to Germany’s ~65%), but its share of the budget devoted to social services is almost identical. Spain’s current growth is predicated on a general increase in the money supply and a relatively successful immigration strategy over the last two decades. The immigrant population has gone from 3.5 million in 2005 to 7 million in 2025. This has contributed to lower GDP per capita, which is why many Spaniards have barely felt the macroeconomic growth. Despite immigration, the birth rate in Spain is among the lowest in Europe (1.12, lower than Germany, France, and the UK), which makes the long-term sustainability of the welfare state questionable under the logic that it is the current workforce that pays for it. The case for slashing public spending is usually the same: slower economic growth and a smaller workforce reduce the state’s revenues, while the aging population continues to grow and unemployment rises due to slower economic growth. This discourse presents budget cuts as almost inevitable and frames “slower economic growth” as a natural phenomenon, almost like a drought, occurring outside the control of politicians. That it is outside the control of politicians—who have limited control over financial policy—might be correct for the most part. However, to present it as a natural phenomenon implies assuming that markets operate under objective natural forces, like gravity, unaffected by the actors involved. That is simply not the case. The “markets” respond to the actions of individuals and companies. A case in point is the 2008 crash, which was brought about by a set of specific practices, such as the sale of mortgage derivatives, which were known—at least by some—to be fraudulent and to potentially cause the collapse of the entire system. The 2008 crisis is a good example because the financial crisis engineered by big financiers, with or without knowledge, was ultimately paid for by ordinary citizens, and virtually no one was held accountable. It will again be ordinary citizens who pay the price of the geopolitical crisis that now affects Europe with the war in Ukraine. The conflict has unleashed war momentum against the interests of most European citizens, both economically and existentially, which could have been avoided or at least settled early on. Its effects are now precipitating a collapse of European economies and societies. It is not that Europe did not have structural problems before—such as severe demographic decline, chronic underinvestment in digital technologies, a fiscal sustainability problem, or the loss of national sovereignty to an unelected bureaucratic class—but with the war in Ukraine, all these issues have become more pronounced. These problems have been compounded by the loss of cheap energy supplies from Russia—which were a lifeline to both industry and individuals—and the Trump administration’s demand that Europe foot the bill for the war in Ukraine and pay back the U.S. for years of supposedly favorable trade terms. While Merz warns Germans that they should be ready to see cuts in public spending, he continues to support Ukraine with €9 billion this year and has changed the country’s debt rules, which will skyrocket the debt-to-GDP ratio. According to a recent interview, he claimed that if he had not done so, the “NATO alliance would have disintegrated in June.” NATO member states, compelled at Trump’s behest to raise defense spending to 5% of GDP, will necessarily see cuts in public spending to offset this defense rise. Germany, France, and the UK are leading European support for Ukraine, promising to give Ukraine €100 billion to buy arms from the U.S. To this spending on Ukraine must be added the “Rearm Europe” plan, which, as Conor Gallagher very aptly argues, will result in armies ill-equipped to face Russia’s forces but well suited to face Europe’s own citizens: “Defense spending by EU member states is now projected to reach 381 billion euros this year, up over last year’s record of 343 billion. Despite all the money being burned at the altar of Project Ukraine, sober analysts conclude that European nations are woefully ill-equipped to successfully do much of any fighting there, and no amount of money is going to change that for the foreseeable future (…) But all the additional weaponry and surveillance goodies that aren’t immediately tossed into the corrupt pit of death that is Ukraine could be more likely to be used on an increasingly discontented population rather than against Russia. We’re already seeing it happen.” No wonder many Europeans are discontent when they are told that the basic underlying logic of their relationship with the state—the social contract embodied in the welfare state—has changed, yet they are unable to exit the contract. They are told there is no money for education, healthcare, or pensions, yet there appears to be an unending flow of money for weapons and war—a war that does not seem to be in the interests of most European citizens. The sovereignty of modern nation-states, which are paradigmatic European creations, rests on the assumption that the state embodies the “will of the people.” The somewhat abstract concept of “will to representation” is converted into “sovereign will” and vested in the “state.” This presupposes that the role of the state and the state bureaucracy is to safeguard the interests of its citizens. In Europe, the rise of the welfare state dates back to the end of the First World War. But it was really after the Second World War, in a Europe destroyed and impoverished, that the Western European states, with the help of the Marshall Plan, began developing a new social model. The war had left Europe ideologically and morally dead, so rather than ideals or morals, the state offered comfort and security in exchange for obedience and taxes. This model seemed to work and offered a compromise—a European way—between the capitalist model of the U.S. and the communist one of the Soviet Union. Although some of this is true, the success of the model was predicated on and expanded through the economic preeminence of Western Europe allied to the U.S.—some would say a vassal—especially after the fall of the Soviet Union. Parallel to, and as a consequence of, the rise of the welfare system was the growth of the state and the ever-increasing tax burden on its citizens. Starting in the 1960s, to finance the state, the value-added tax was implemented—first in France and later throughout Europe. The justification for this new tax was that the state needed the funds to finance welfare benefits. Europeans accepted this and other substantial tax increases, as well as sweeping new laws and regulations, afraid of returning to a pre-war scenario and comfortable with state benefits. So much so that, in Europe, “the state” has become almost synonymous with “the welfare state.” This logic—Europe’s underlying social contract—has held Western European society together. Though not without critique, it was widely accepted. When François Bayrou proposed the €44 billion cut to social services that ended his government, both the right and the left voted against it. In France, where society is currently extremely polarized, this is not a minor detail but a significant indicator. The protests that have erupted in defense of the welfare state—on which both left and right are trying to capitalize—are further proof. The current push for costly military readiness and arms spending seems to go against the logic of the welfare state, which is to say, against the interests of ordinary Europeans, thus changing the state’s side of the social contract. Now the state offers security and protection, not order and welfare, and asks more—not less—of citizens. That logic, in turn, requires new threats and enemies—and the launching of new wars. This happens because the state is, economically and ideologically, bankrupt. This is not an anomaly but a feature of this model of state sovereignty as now embodied in the European Union. If the state embodies the “will of the people,” then the goal of the state, conceived as an expression of sovereign will, has to be nothing more than its perpetual existence. “It is not an end among others; it is that end for which all others can be sacrificed,” writes Paul W. Kahn in Putting Liberalism in Its Place. Well with people like Kaja Kallas, they will go from fighting Russia to the last Ukrainian to fighting Russia to the last European. Seems like a natural progression. Those living in democratic Western nations have always had the opportunity to oppose military buildups in preparation for war with Russia. Yet, they chose not to. If they end up living in hunger and poverty, they will only have themselves to blame. >>>If they end up living in hunger and poverty, they will only have themselves to blame. Just like us Americans who despite keeping voting for change keep getting shafted by both the Democrats and the Republicans? I don’t know much about European politics, but I think that European politics, just like American politics, is rigged to favor the oligarchs and the politicians who serve them. Sadly, in the UK we have lived under an increasingly party-based authoritarian liberal oligarchy dressed with a rapidly fading and shrinking tinsel of electoral democracy wrapped around it. The BBC, funded by every license holder, lies, both by commission and omission, as does the MSM and the channels the MSM supports on Youtube, &c (no, the Times and Telegraph channels may sound like derivatives of ‘Round the Horne’ but, alas, they are not). The UK is not very different from other European countries which seem to be responding in similar ways by supporting new parties which wish to cast aside many of the constraints imposed by tradition and more recent custom and practice. We Brits have attempted to control HMG’s willingness to go down to defeat in wars the USA has embroiled us from Korea, by acts of civil disobedience and political demonstrations, through the Cruise missile crisis and the wonderful women of Greenham Common, the vicious war against civil rights activists in Ulster, the destruction of Serbia’s territorial integrity, the illegal invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, the overthrow and murder of Gadaffi and other leaders in North and sub-Saharan Africa, and the murderous regime put in place by the US and British Ukrainian coup and the subsequent conflict over Russian civil rights in the Donbass leading to the SMO. Sadly, none of our efforts worked. So the only option is to support completely new parties and to clean house even more thoroughly than Cromwell did. The real choice at the next election will be between Reform and Your Party. The same process is occurring or has occurred in countries on the European mainland and it looks as if many governments are more than prepared to go to war against their own people to maintain the privileges of the politcal and financial élite. The British have been prepared to give their lives for liberty in the past and will do so again. And this is true of every European nation. Our future is one of economic decline unless we come to terms with the emerging new world order and this pressure will only intensify the movement towards the most unLampedusa-like changes in the body politic. Is there any possibility that a potential future target of the new European militarism might be to the south of the continent, across the sea? A second prize of resources, if first prize (Russia) doesn’t pan out? European entities seem to devolve toward the principle of following the will of the right people. Elitism can take many forms, from directing the lower orders to getting exclusive access to perks. More transparency showing the hidden levers and accounts would be a start toward citizen understanding. Who pushes so hard for weaponry and war, and why? And how do a few individuals get to cause so many problems? Looking at BoJo, for one. Who wants country welfare programs to be overwhelmed by migrants, political, economic or otherwise? It looks like a real race to the end is looming in Europe. Who will be killed off first? The destructor propagators of mass death – Leyen Kallas Rutte Merz Macron Starmer et al Or millions of individuals among the people of Europe, some of whom are slowly coming to realise what trap is being set up for them. People in all of Europe – Germans, Spaniards, Serbs, Italians, Poles, Brits. Everyone. The financial data suggest the OK Coral is a low single digits of years away. Scary. The European welfare state, along with Social Security and other programs in the US, was created in part to keep those filthy commies at bay, not out of the goodness of the elite heart. Once there was no more USSR to worry about…. I don’t think it’s a coincidence the concrete material benefits for citizens have been on the decline while the wealth disparity has increased drastically for the last 40 years or so. Nazis, the West is fine with – many Western countries gladly invited them in after hostilities were over. It’s the sharing bit that just can’t be tolerated. This is simply not true about the experience of Western Europe. Most Western European states had some form of welfare system in place by the inter-war years not least because of trades union pressure and the need to support the dependents of the lost male population during the Great War. Bismark created the German welfare state as part of his effort to ensure the unification of Germany and to provide a secure basis for German industrial workers and soldiers – and it worked, and the rest of us followed in Germany’s wake. But something else happened during The Great War–something in Russia. Surely this had an effect on how European governments treated the working class. Then when that thing was finally defeated ideologically Thatcher could proclaim “there is no alternative.” Which is not to argue that political ideas control history but rather to agree with Stephen Douglas that “power concedes nothing without a demand.” The Russian Revolution was that demand scared the Euro aristocracy mightily. Some effect, maybe. The move towards the welfare state in Europe began before that, however (1880s in Germany, 1900s in Britain… I think most European countries started introducing key elements of modern welfare systems like old age pension schemes, somewhere in 1880-1910s; the only one I can find quickly that could conceivably be blamed on us is Italy, 1919 – there are many other examples outside of Europe, and there things may have been different). It was influenced in large part by domestic “demand”, or by the desire to stave off their own socialist and unionist movements, but there were other considerations as well: inter-European competition; wanting to keep the race in shape to keep down the colonial populations; even, though you may dismiss that, Christian paternalism, patriotism and/or social progressivism as elements of elite ideology and self-image. The Great October Socialist Revolution/October coup did influence later development to some extent, but it merely reinforced preexisting trends. I am not sure if its influence was always a helpful one for this, for that matter – it also helped start a powerful right-wing backlash that did not compare to what existed before the war. And I’d say it’s also an example of how ideas do control history – if people in and out of power had not conceived of such reforms, no one would have enacted them. The development of the welfare states of Europe can be traced well back to the mid-19th Century at least – they were arguably the result of the weakening of religion and the strengthening of the secular state, but you can trace its origins well back to medieval times – many towns and cities has surprisingly sophisticated social systems designed to protect the poorest organised by various forms of town governance (councils/guilds,etc). The motives were the usual complex mix of compassion, religious belief, social pressure, ideology and fear. They long predate any fear of socialism, although not of course fear of peasant uprisings. Later northern European welfare systems, developed as private companies became larger and more influential and developed their own health/welfare systems (often, of course, under trade union pressure), and these in time became generalised by the State in order to iron out social pressures between those protected by those corporate systems and those (not necessarily poor) on the outside. The complexity of the history is one reason why these systems are so complex (a health economist friend was fond of joking that there are only about 3 people alive who understand how the Dutch health system works) and have roots that go well beyond the notional ‘start’ of any particular scheme. Its also a key reason as to why there are so many deep differences between their design and implementation across Europe. Even between quite ‘similar’ countries – such as Denmark and Sweden – there are often very fundamental differences in both the background politics and the nuts and bolts of implementation of these systems. For the most part, they work surprisingly well, despite several decades of attacks by neoliberals (even Thatcher feared tackling the NHS). The key threat, as the article alludes – is that the pension/care systems are for the most part based on assumptions of rising population/economic growth which no longer hold. This is, in my opinion, a key reason why domestic politicians have been so reluctant to tackle immigration. The projections are horrible if you rely on domestic fertility – but this applies now all over the developed and intermediately developed world. Its a nettle that has yet to be firmly grasped by any country. Oh, of course – I specifically meant the comparatively standardised and systematic modern welfare systems as pioneered by Bismarck or Lloyd George, but depending on one’s definitions, some forms of state (or, more often, municipal?) welfare existed for centuries or indeed for as long as human civilisation. Standardised welfare of the Bismarck type is, to my knowledge, a 19th century European novelty; so is the ideologically-driven rejection of state welfare, though indeed, even such fanatics as Thatcher had a healthy fear of going too far in attacking what people had come to rely on. ” Stephen” Douglas? Surely you mean Frederick Douglas. Yes sorry for the senior moment. And to the other replies to my comment I’ll just point out that the Russian revolution was preceded by others in Europe and perhaps most importantly our own which rejected a king (coming soon as Ken Burns PBS doc). I think the statement made by Frederick Douglas is to the point and that point is that those at the pinnacle of power do not back down other than from the threat of violence since violence is how they maintain their position. Even in enlightened 19th century Britain (paging Dickens) you could still be drawn and quartered. Of course democracy is supposed to provide another path which is why they are doing so much to undermine it. There are a lot of problems here, and a lot of misguided prejudices (I am not refering to the article, but about common knowledge). Europe, except the USSR, the last European power, was done in 1945. It was pretty clear in the Suez crisis. Yes, they were important countries in a slow decline, but decline. EEC-EU-Europe, or Euroamerica, is a marginal side of the US hegemonic system. The EEC was a optimizing system for the main economies of Western Europe, it was never designed for advanced but small countries like Sweden, Switzerland or Austria, not at all for undeveloped like Greece, Spain, Portugal, let alone ex-COMECON and the lot, not even the fiasco of a United Germany. It became a chaos. It was a economic device, not even a political one, the Paris-Berlin axis was a mirage (because of German partition), it lasted until 1990s, UK was ever a disloyal member, and the like. The political device was, and is, NATO, all the powerful countries of the EU are nothing without it, and the traction of NATO was to make the EU as similar to the US as possible as fast as possible. The welfare state was a concession by fear of the Soviet Union, which exists no more. There is no reason not to carry the EU to the same social welfare standards of the US, which is what is happening. Corruption is massive, as ever was, so if we don’t see things from this point of view, we hardly understand anything. Taxes are lower than ever, in the sense that they are not extracting money where it is, in fact they collect less and less in a suicidal temptative to keep alive the system. If things were that far away without resistance, it’s more than dubious they are going to change in the next few years. Firstly, people must be aware about reality, not the bubble where they forced to live, and only after that, something could happen. Or not. All these comments are well and good, but of course, the interesting part is the question of what Putin’s motivations are. Is the attack on Poland because of internal failures in Russia, or are their other reasons? Putin obviously has his eyes on Latvia and Estonia, where a goodly portion of the population is Russian. One would have thought that they would be easier anti-Nato targets. There is obviously a ‘message’ here. Poland has historically been vulnerable because it is flat, and a convenient invasion corridor. Back in the day, when the European militaries worried about mass invasions by tanks, that made sense. Mutandis mutandi, it’s a drone’s world now. And it’s not like Israel, which gets its military weapons free, courtesy of ‘foreign aid’ from the US. Putin has to pay for all the Iranian drones and missles as well as domestic arms production. Has something changed internally that makes expansion of hostilities desirable? I’m sure the there’s ‘less here than meets the eye’, but being merely a slightly astute citizen myself, I can’t suss it out. Was there even an attack on Poland? Even that badic premise remains unclear. One might as well ask what the Poles were thinking at Gleiwitz, 1939. Ukraine did hack Russia drones, then send them through Belarus. Belarus even warned Poland about the drones. Fun fact. The drones that entered Poland did not have the range to reach there if launched from Russian positions. It was too far as the Russians pointed out. So either they were taken there by magical tailwinds that no weather report shows or else these were captured drones that were launched by Zelensky to bring Poland and NATO into the fighting. I’m going with Door Number Two. UK media has commented that they were launched from Belarus. Reports from Belarus said that they had a few enter their airspace which were shot down so gave Poland a heads up that they might have a few come their way. As for UK media, they are on par with Oz media or German media which is not a high bar. Some Brits say that the BBC actually stands for the British Bull******* Corporation as an example. Bad Old debating Technique- answering a question with a question. Maybe they were just playing questions- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3xIs0aajN4 “The underlying social contract between individuals and the state in Western European nations over the last hundred years has been that the state would grow to regulate and tax virtually every sphere of life—public or private—in exchange for a measure of order and comfort for its citizens…” Even though the final para states “This is not an anomaly but a feature of this model of state sovereignty as now embodied in the European Union. ..” the author doesn’t appear to acknowledge that the underlying European social contract between individuals and the nation state was effectively broken with the adoption of the financially unfederated Brussels governed administered common currency structure of European Union 26 yrs ago. The individual nation states in adopting the Euro surrendered their capacity to deliver on that social contract to unelected administrators in Brussels. Each Eurozone member state in abandoning their national currency, gave up their fiscal sovereignty to adopt the Euro – effectively a foreign issued currency. Together with accepting an arbitrarily Brussels enforced annual 3% fiscal deficit limit it was inevitable that expanded state monetary needs for industry/population growth would eat into the available funds necessary to deliver on that social contract. The US, itself a nation of 50 fully financially federated states, knew full well the implications of that structure – a stealthy ploy to slowly but surely destroy European socialism. IMHO a structure designed to keep Europe down, socially divided with vassalised financial elites in firm, ever growing control. An article worth re-reading (after 13 yrs) by Greg Palas is ‘Robert Mundell, evil genius of the euro.’ See also William Mitchell’s Eurozone Dystopia: Groupthink and Denial on a Grand Scale https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/30343868-eurozone-dystopia and Mitchell and Fazi’s Reclaiming the State: A Progressive Vision of Sovereignty for a Post-Neoliberal World https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/36426386-reclaiming-the-state Any residual social contract in the UK was erased from 1980 when unemployment first hit 2m down to the Thatcherite dogma that unemployment was “a price worth paying”. The loss of trust in the political class during deindustrialisation, and social insecurity, has led to the rise of right wing populist insurgents preying on disaffection. Any of the European nations which has experienced youth unemployment over 20% and poor real wage increases over the last few decades is likely to have the same social insecurity. I agree. The state demands you obey the laws, keep the peace, respect your fellow citizens. In other words, to put the common good before your individual good. In return the state must give you the opportunity to thrive within those constraints. If it doesn’t all bets are off. “Another European nation that might need an IMF bailout—perhaps even more urgently than France—is the UK. The UK’s debt is becoming significantly more expensive to service due to a sharp rise in borrowing costs, which now amount to over £100 billion annually—nearly 10% of the national budget…” The UK does not need an IMF bailout – The UK is the sole fully sovereign issuer of the UK£. It can pay any debt it incurs denominated in the UK£. When will journalists ever spend the time researching how National monetary systems actually function? In a democracy with well informed citizens then the choice between having billionaires or having a social safety net would be easy. As is then I’d say that either the citizens aren’t well-informed and we have democracy or we don’t have democracy and what we do have is oligarchy. A subtle choice of words can be used when engaging in propaganda. The difference in outcome between asking if people want a welfare state or if they want a social safety net is (at least in my strong belief) huge. I believe that as long as the ‘opposition’ to the status quo are using phrases suggested by supporters of the status quo then the ‘opposition’ will not drive any change. Not sure about this: chronic underinvestment in digital technologies . It wasn’t explained and I am not sure what is being referred to. Bacchunin observes further upthread, “Taxes are lower than ever, in the sense that they are not extracting money where it is.” Setting aside for the moment the MMT realities of fiat money (since Eurozone constituent states aren’t individually monetarily sovereign, having foolishly given that implement of sovereignty away in Maastricht) it ought to be obvious to anyone who can read a balance sheet that somebody owns all of the debt which makes these countries “insolvent.” Yet the press never makes the connection between rising inequality, the ever growing number of billionaires and state “insolvency.” It’s almost like rich people own the media … 🤨 Your email address will not be published.

Title: CIA/Mossad False Flag Psyop Kicks Off on First Day of Skool While Antichrist Peter Thiel Takes Control of Government

Editor Podcasts Jeff Berwick, The Dollar Vigilante It’s hard to believe, but summer is already wrapping up (for most, anyway). That one went fast. We’re sliding into the exact window I said would bring a major crash/collapse, but I’ll circle back to that shortly. The young minds of the USSA are already being marched back into the camps, to be reshaped and conditioned until they’re ready to wear that Saturn cube on their heads, provided they obey well enough. And, right on cue, day one brought the first psy-op of the skool year, staged and broadcast by the CIA/Mossad tag team through their media mouthpieces. On August 27, 23-year-old Robin/Robert Westman, a former student at Annunciation Catholic Skool in Minneapolis, supposedly showed up at the connected church with a rifle, a shotgun, and a pistol (all “legally purchased,” of course), and blasted through stained glass windows into a packed Mass. An 8-year-old and a 10-year-old were killed. Seventeen others wounded – 14 kids and 3 elderly parishioners in their 80s. Tragic. Terrifying. And, if you’re paying attention, textbook. At this point, you almost don’t even need to look into the details anymore, because every skool shooting in the USSA might as well be stamped “CIA/Mossad Production” right from the start. Usually, after a few minutes of digging, you’ll see the fingerprints: a trans MK Ultra patsy, the same shady networks funding and covering, and, surprise, surprise, BlackRock lurking in the background. But this time? They didn’t even bother hiding it. The shooter’s weapon literally had “Sponsored by BlackRock” scribbled on it. And headlines screamed things like: “Minneapolis shooter was ‘tired of being trans’ and had been ‘brainwashed’ into being female.” Translation: yes, the shooter was under mind control. They said it out loud. So, let’s ask the investigator’s first question: Who benefits? Well, the shooter’s gun was also covered with scribbles like “6 million wasn’t enough,” “Jew Gas,” “Burn Israel,” “Israel must fall.” And just like that, the script kicked in. Agenda #1: Call it an “anti-semitic hate crime.” Even though the target was a Catholic skool. Even though neither shooter nor victims were “semitic” in any sense of the word (and let’s be honest, most people in Israhell aren’t either). Still, headlines push the “anti-semitic” label, and in the background, laws and crackdowns on so-called hate speech get ratcheted up another notch. Agenda #2: Who, right now, is openly bloodthirsty for killing goyim children? Exactly. And here it is again, reframed as an “attack on the chosen,” while they do the very thing they accuse others of. They’re masters at flipping the script. Agenda #3: Victim politics. Somehow, this was also spun into another notch in the “trans people are under attack” narrative. They never miss a beat. Agenda #4: Gun grab. Fox News, politicians, the usual suspects paraded in front of cameras, calling to ban “assault rifles.” Some even floated the idea that young white men, specifically, should be disarmed. Agenda #5: Surveillance expansion. Calls for “pre-crime” systems à la Palantir. The idea? That the government should know everything you think, feel, and intend before you even act. Predictive policing, Minority Report, straight-up thought-crime. All from one operation. Problem → Reaction → Solution. The Hegelian dialectic is alive and well. And, that’s just one op layered with multiple payoffs. There are plenty more running in parallel right now. But what they really need is a global event – something catastrophic enough to make normies beg for the digital prison. Something that makes people say, “Please, track me, watch me, jab me, save me.” That’s where September might very likely come in. For example: A staged strike blamed on Russia, or Iran, could flip the switch. “Pearl Harbor 2.0” to rally the sheep. One missile, one explosion, one “accident” in September could be all it takes to justify the next forever war. Or, maybe a Plandemic 2.0 rollout. Already, the headlines whisper about “new variants.” Masks creeping back. There’s no stopping the Crime And Death Corporation (CDC), who now has a Peter Thiel inner-circle crony as its new CEO. Notice the timing. Right before September, they prime the headlines with “rising Covid variants”, with ‘no symptoms’ still a terrifying, invisible symptom. Don’t worry if you can’t get your 11th booster immediately, RFK Jr. will soon be rolling out the all encompassing natural immunity mRNA jab. Or, a massive ‘climate change’ apocalyptic event. Or, a Titanic-sized market crash. This time, they want everyone in the pen. But, this time, instead of lockdowns first, they’ll use digital ID + AI as the solution. “Want to work? Want to travel? Want to eat? Just hitch your vax pass and your digital money to Palantir’s fascist technocrat wagon. You can’t make this shit up. Round Two will be smoother, faster, harder to escape. The only question left is: which card will they play first?

REUTERS/Amit Dave/File Photo/File Photo | Photo Credit: AMIT DAVE Indian and foreign lenders have significantly increased their exposure to the Adani group over the past 12-15 months, betting on its infrastructure play consisting of cash flow generating real assets. The exposure of Indian lenders has risen over 50 per cent to over ₹1.3 lakh crore, while that of foreign banks has risen 16 per cent to ₹71,744 crore. Domestic lenders’ share in the total debt has risen to over 50 per cent now from 40 per cent last year. This comes at a time when billionaire founder of the group Gautam Adani is being investigated by US regulators for alleged wire and securities fraud and a bribery scheme. Funding through US dollar bonds, a favourite avenue for the group, has fallen 11 per cent during the period as the group has consciously stayed away from the overseas public bond markets pending the settlement of the ongoing probes against it. In April, it did raise $750 million through a private bond sale, a third of which was subscribed by Blackrock. Its overseas bond holders are long-only investors and includes names such as Blackrock, AIA, Pimco, Fidelity, Apollo Global, MetLife, Cigna and Goldman Sachs. The group has been aggressively tapping Indian institutions, and proof of the trust placed in it is the ₹5,000 crore that Life Insurance Corporation invested in the non-convertible debentures issued by Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone in May this year, to refinance short-term debt. Most of the rise in exposure by Indian lenders is accounted for by public sector banks led by State Bank of India and non-bank and institutional lenders. Sources pointed out that the lenders are getting comfort from its robust cash flows – well over ₹60,000 crore or about a quarter of its total debt – and that it is creating long-term infrastructure assets. For instance, around 80 per cent of its recent capital expenditure has gone into expanding its green energy portfolio. It is planning to spend around $70 billion in green investments. Last financial year the group’s capex was close to $15 billion, and Adani has indicated an annual spend of $15-20 billion over the next five years. Of its total EBITDA of close to ₹90,000 crore, over 80 per cent is accounted for by its core infrastructure businesses that comprise its energy portfolio, transport and the businesses being incubated under Adani Enterprises, such as airports. The energy companies in its portfolio have entered into long term power purchase agreements that provide cash visibility for extended periods. For instance, in May, Adani Green Energy signed a 40-year PPA for a 1.25 GW pumped hydro project in Uttar Pradesh. Adani Power also has a 25-year agreement to supply thermal power to the State.

Rather, the recently appointed leader for the publicly traded company—which has rapidly amassed over $3.7 billion worth of Ethereum—believes it will be a positive "white swan event" that brings institutional ETH adoption to levels never seen before. Joseph Chalom told Decrypt that the firm is putting Ethereum on the radar of non-crypto companies and educating them on the potential of the network. As such, he thinks it's “inevitable” that more big players will adopt Ethereum as stablecoins and tokenization become mainstream. “When they start realizing that they can reduce their capital requirements for trading, when they think they can reduce the risk involved in trading and transacting, and moving money, I think it's going to be inevitable,” he explained. “The white swan event is: We're explaining to users what the potential is, and you're starting to see that adoption.” The comments come amid growing concern that the surging crypto treasury company trend could end in disaster, with fears intensifying at the same pace as the trend’s growing popularity as bears cite the huge amounts of tokens the biggest firms are accumulating. SharpLink, at the time of writing, holds 837,230 ETH, or approximately 0.69% of the total circulating ETH supply—raising concerns about whether they’d ever sell. “We are not sellers of Ethereum. We are accumulators of Ethereum,” Chalom told Decrypt. “And if there are moments that you need liquidity, you can raise liquidity through debt instruments. You could do stock buybacks. So our intent is not to sell our Ethereum. It's a reserve asset, not a trading asset.” This approach was pioneered by Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin treasury company, Strategy, previously known as MicroStrategy. The one-time business software company has raised capital via debt instruments such as multiple rounds of convertible note offerings, and continued to stockpile BTC—now holding over $72 billion worth. Consequently, users on Myriad Markets—a prediction market developed by Decrypt’s parent company DASTAN—see a more than 94% likelihood that Strategy will not sell any Bitcoin this year. As a result, Chalom categorically ruled out the crypto treasury trend being the black swan event of this cycle—a term for a rare event that has a severe impact on the market, such as the FTX collapse. “Absolutely not, unless you mean the black swan event to drive mind share and adoption,” Chalom said. “The reason why I say it's just not even in the same league as [FTX] is this is the most transparent approach you can have.” The former BlackRock head of digital assets strategy explained that due to SharpLink being a public company, it is regulated by the SEC and required to follow Nasdaq rules. The firm puts out a weekly press release disclosing its holdings, purchase price, accumulated ETH rewards, and more. By comparison, he argues, the FTX situation came out of a lack of transparency. As Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX crumbled, it was discovered that the crypto exchange was sharing customer funds with his trading firm Alameda Research, to help shore up its losses. That meant that when a large number of FTX users sought to withdraw their funds, the exchange didn’t have the capital ready to fill those requests. Chalom argued that a public company couldn’t get away with such a scheme, due to its required transparency and adherence to regulations. Still, FTX was required to follow the law even as a private company, and Bankman-Fried was ultimately sentenced to 25 years in prison for his involvement in fraud and conspiracy at FTX. Chalom believes that SharpLink is building interest in Ethereum among major institutions, which he thinks will soon adopt the technology. Be it stablecoins, tokenizing real-world assets, or deploying programmable money, the co-CEO expects that the biggest players will be using Ethereum soon. And, he says, SharpLink is the first step in educating those players about cryptocurrency. “There's a giant amount of education here,” Chalom said. “And I think it doesn't take convincing, it takes explaining.” When compared to Bitcoin, which is often marketed as “digital gold,” selling Ethereum to traditional investors is a much more complicated process. That’s why, he said, Ethereum’s price may have lagged behind Bitcoin’s over the past year as investors flocked to Bitcoin ETFs more than Ethereum ones. That, he said, is set to change. “It was just easier to explain its role in a portfolio,” Chalom said of Bitcoin. “[With] Ethereum, you're telling them a network effect growth story, that is no different in some ways than Web1 and the internet. It's essentially the decentralized internet moment of both finance and other real-world activity.” “That just took a look a little bit longer to explain, and the adoption will take longer,” he added. “It just may have an impact that's 10, 20x on what Bitcoin has had on the financial ecosystem.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Institutions continue to double down on crypto. BlackRock’s crypto stash topped $100 billion, less than two years since Spot BTC and ETH ETFs debuted. Will the ETH ETF staking approval expand the holdings? The world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, now controls over $100 billion worth of crypto, underscoring increasing institutional demand for the asset class. According to Arkham data, the firm’s Bitcoin [BTC] holdings have grown to 740.5K coins worth about $85 billion as of press time. Source: Arkham Ethereum [ETH] is the second-largest crypto asset held by BlackRock. As of writing, the firm had 3.66 million ETH, worth about $16B, collectively bringing its core holdings to over $100B. However, BlackRock’s ETH accumulation has lost some steam towards the end of Q3, compared to BTC. For BTC, it ramped up its stash from 698K BTC to over 740K, about 6% surge in the past two months. Source: Bitcoin Treasuries In the past seven days of trading, BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust has seen over 58K ETH outflows, about a 1.4% decline over the same period. The net assets dropped from over $17B to $15.9B amid the outflows and ETH price pullback. Source: SoSo Value According to analytics firm LookOnChain, BlackRock sold nearly $200M worth of ETH on the 9th of September, 2x higher than the amount of BTC ($100M) offloaded over the same period. Simply put, investors in BlackRock crypto products have shown remarkable resilience in BTC compared to ETH. Source: LookOnChain However, it remains to be seen how the potential staking approval could improve the overall demand for ETH ETFs. That said, Spot BTC ETFs remain the keyholders of BTC. As of September, this category of investors controls about 7% (1.4 million) of BTC’s total 21 million supply of coins. In contrast, corporate treasuries, led by Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), command 4.6% (1 million BTC) of the overall supply.

BlackRock, J.P. Morgan and CPP Investments are among several institutional investors that potentially missed out on billions of dollars in gains by dumping millions of shares in Google parent Alphabet Inc. just before the stock ascended to a 52-week high. The tech giant’s Class A share price climbed steadily during the second quarter, rising 29% from its 52-week low of $140.53 on April 7 to $181.23 on June 30. The shares surged further to a 52-week high of $232.37 on September 4 after a court ruled that Google will not be forced to sell its Chrome browser. Google’s nonvoting C shares traded between a low of $142.66 on April 7 and a high of $182.45 on June 10. The trading activity was reported in second quarter filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, but the sale dates and prices were not disclosed. Based on the high and low stock prices during the quarter, sellers potentially missed out on gains of at least 28% and as much as 65%, as of September 4. Investors who sold Alphabet’s nonvoting C shares (GOOG) potentially missed out on runs of 28% to 64%. Among the sellers, BlackRock sold approximately 9.4 million Alphabet Class A shares and about 3 million Class C shares during Q2. The total sale price of the A-shares ranged from $1.32 billion to $1.70 billion, while C shares sold for $428.9 million to $548.5 million. Never miss a story — sign up for CIO newsletters to stay up-to-date on the latest institutional investment industry news.  As of September 4, the world’s largest asset manager’s A shares would have been worth $2.18 billion, and its C shares would have been worth $700 million. By not holding onto the shares, BlackRock potentially missed out on gains of $480 million to $860 million for its A shares and $151.5 million to $271.1 million for its Class C holdings. Capital Group’s Capital Research Global Investors unit sold more than 10 million A shares during Q2 for between $1.41 billion and $1.81 billion, as well as about 8.7 million C shares for $1.24 billion to $1.59 billion. The sales reduced Capital Research’s holdings in Alphabet A shares and C shares by 19% and 24%, respectively. Had the firm held on to the A shares, they would have been worth $2.33 billion as of September 4, potentially missing out on gains of between $520 million to $920 million. Capital Research’s C shares would have been worth $2.03 billion as of the same date, with potential value of $435 million to $785 million. J.P. Morgan sold approximately 4.2 million Class A shares during Q2 for between $590.2 million and $761.2 million. Those shares would have been worth $975.7 million as of September 4, meaning missed gains of $214.5 million to $385.5 million. It also sold about 10.6 million C shares for between $1.51 billion and $1.93 billion, which would have been worth nearly $2.5 billion as of September 4.

The C$732 billion ($529 billion) Canada Pension Plan Investment Board sold approximately 21% of its A shares, or 2.5 million shares, for between $351.3 million and $453.1 million, and about 1% of its C shares—about 85,000 shares—for between $12.1 million and $15.5 million. As of September 4, those shares would have been worth approximately $581 million and $20 million, respectively. Among other institutional investors, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board sold off 2.4 million shares—43%—of its Class A holdings in Alphabet and about 3% of its C shares. Canada’s C$330 billion Public Sector Pension Investment Board reduced its Alphabet A and C shares by 24% and 40%, respectively. Soros Fund Management dumped 95% of its Class A shares during Q2.

The regulator requested for more time to review recent filings SEC has delayed its decision on several altcoins and staking ETFs filings to October and November. Will the approvals trigger a strong market rally in Q4? The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delayed its decision on several crypto ETFs and related staking applications. The regulator requested more time until late October or mid-November to review the requests from interested issuers. On the pending Ethereum [ETH] ETF staking list, BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, Fidelity, 21Shares, and Grayscale were all delayed. Source: SEC For BlackRock’s staking application, the agency extended the final deadline to the 30th of October. The world’s largest asset manager made its first filing for this provision in July. The decision on Franklin Templeton’s crypto index and ETF staking permission was pushed to the 13th of November. In addition, the agency postponed the decision on Spot Solana [SOL] and Ripple [XRP] applications by Franklin Templeton to the 14th of November. Already, the market was extremely positive about the outcome of these altcoin ETF filings. In fact, XRP Futures hit a record level amid anticipation ahead of the Q4 deadline. Despite the delay, issuers continue to submit new crypto ETF filings with the regulator. Asset manager VanEck is reportedly planning to file for a Spot Hyperliquid [HYPE] staking ETF in the U.S. and an exchange-traded offering in Europe. According to a Bloomberg ETF analyst, James Seyffart, there are over 90 crypto ETFs waiting for the SEC’s decision. This includes even memecoins. In fact, the first U.S.-based memecoin ETF, a Dogecoin [DOGE], will debut this week, setting the stage for potentially more approvals. Additionally, even chances of ETH staking approval remain high. Especially after the recent SEC’s guidance that liquid staking tokens aren’t securities, but receipts that show proof of deposits. The massive wave of crypto ETFs follows the regulatory shift and ongoing clarity that most crypto tokens aren’t securities. However, if approved, the public demand for these altcoin ETF products will determine whether they will be traded on public exchanges for an extended period of time or be delisted.

Three or four other active equity funds are in the pipeline, which may see the light of day this fiscal. Other products, including ETFs, will follow in due course,” JioBlackRock AMC chief investment officer Rishi Kohli said. The fund, built on BlackRock’s globally proven SAE platform, follows a rules-based and predominantly machine-driven process tracking 400 signals. About 95 per cent of the investment process will be technology-driven, aiming to eliminate key-person risk, reduce cognitive biases, and ensure disciplined fund management. The SAE Flexi-Cap Fund will maintain a controlled active risk of no more than 3-4 per cent, lower than industry averages, with a focus on downside risk protection and consistent returns for investors. Kohli said a 10-year simulation indicated the model could deliver 3-4 per cent outperformance over the benchmark index, similar to results achieved in other BlackRock country funds. “In an uncertain market environment, where equity markets have been tough, we believe it’s a good time to launch a product that manages risk on the lower side compared to other active funds and still aims for attractive alpha in the long run,” Kohli said. JioBlackRock, the partnership between Jio Financials and the world's largest asset managers BlackRock, received its license in May and currently manages around ₹18,000 crore in assets across eight cash and index funds. The fund house will continue to focus on digital distribution in the near term. The official, however, did not comment on AUM targets or a break-even timeline.

Today's top news: Solana just printed a seven-month high. And its fresh new narrative may be enough to drive it to new ATHs in 2025. SOL climbed ~4% Wednesday to nearly $225, its highest level since February, and is up about 25% over the past month. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan says the same forces that powered Bitcoin and Ethereum’s rally (ETF inflows and corporate/treasury accumulation) are now lining up for Solana, setting the stage for an “epic end-of-year run.” Here’s a glimpse at what’s happening for Solana right now: It’s a very nice setup. “For the last 18 months, the recipe for strong returns in crypto has been clear: Take one part exchange traded products (ETP) inflows, add strong corporate treasury purchases, and voilà-you get big returns… All the ingredients are there for an epic end-of-year run for Solana.” - Matt Hougan, CIO, Bitwise This is one of those trades that feels too easy to be true. But SOL has nearly the exact same setup as BTC and ETH before it. Institutional flows have been the primary force driving crypto majors price action over the past 18 months. And now it’s Solana’s turn. They’ve got ~$3B in SOL TreasuryCo’s incoming and ETFs coming Q4 (though it should be noted that BlackRock isn’t in the mix, the highest volume ETF facilitator). And a strong ecosystem, with apps like Pump Fun driving top-5 revenue numbers across all of crypto. It’s certainly not a done deal by any means. The TreasuryCo’s could end up being underwhelming. The ETFs might not catch much volume in the early months. Leading apps might sputter. But with many thinking Bitcoin will make sweeping new ATHs in Q4 2025 (I’m in this cohort), it’s not a big stretch to think SOL will also make a run. And it has real drivers.

The largest ETH treasury firm BitMine Immersion Technologies (NYSE: BMNR) has continued with its aggressive Ethereum ETH $4 690 24h volatility: 3.3% Market cap: $566.28 B Vol. 24h: $36.36 B purchases, buying another $200 million worth of ETH in early Asian trading hours on Sept. 11. This latest purchase comes as ETH price shows signs of recovery, gaining 3% today to $4,440, amid broader crypto market rally. Tom Lee’s BitMine continues with its aggressive Ethereum purchases, adding another 46,255 coins, worth a massive $200million, to their ETH treasury, on September 11. The purchase follows Monday’s acquisition of 202,500 ETH, pushing BitMine’s total holdings past 2.1 million ETH, valued at more than $9.2 billion. With the latest addition, BitMine maintains its lead as the largest corporate holder of Ethereum, far ahead of Sharplink Gaming’s 837,000 ETH treasury. According to the data from Strategic ETH Reserve, BitMine’s two big ETH purchases this week nearly matched the total ETH accumulated by all treasury firms last week. The ETH treasury firms have been raising more cash ammunition, through stock and bond sales, to further build their Ethereum reserves. Last week, corporate buyers accumulated 273,300 ETH in total, with The Ether Machine leading the purchases at 150,000 ETH, followed by BitMine with 74,300 ETH. Amid its aggressive purchases, BMNR stock has also witnessed a trend reversal after a 23% correction over the past month. On the weekly chart, BMNR stock is up 5%, bouncing back from the lows of $40. Amid the broader crypto market uptick following softer US PPI data and rising Fed rate cut expectations, Ether price has surged 2.5% today on Sept. 11. The daily trading volume in Ethereum has jumped 38% to $41.5 billion, which reflects strong bullish sentiment among traders. Moreover, CoinGlass data shows that the ETH futures open interest has surged over $61.5 billion. Popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted that tighter Bollinger Bands suggest a big move in the ETH price ahead.

Title: PsiQuantum secures $1bn funding
URL: https://www.verdict.co.uk/psiquantum-series-e-round/
Time Published: 2025-09-11T10:36:46Z
Full Content:
PsiQuantum, a US-based quantum computing company, has secured $1bn in Series E funding to accelerate the development of fault-tolerant quantum computers. This funding round was led by affiliates of BlackRock with contributions from Temasek and Baillie Gifford. It values PsiQuantum at $7bn and introduces new investors, including entities managed by Macquarie Capital and Ribbit Capital. The gold standard of business intelligence. Find out more This investment aims to support the establishment of utility-scale quantum computing sites in Brisbane, Australia and Chicago and will aid in the deployment of large-scale prototype systems. It further aims to advance PsiQuantum’s quantum photonic chips and architecture. PsiQuantum’s approach is driven by its focus on error correction, which it believes necessitates around a million physical qubits to achieve commercially viable quantum computing. The company aims to address significant challenges such as manufacturability, cooling, and networking by leveraging the advantages of photonic qubits alongside semiconductor manufacturing processes. PsiQuantum co-founder and CEO Jeremy O’Brien said: “Only building the real thing—million-qubit-scale, fault-tolerant machines—will unlock the promise of quantum computing. “We defined what it takes from day one: this is a grand engineering challenge, not a science experiment. We tackled the hardest problems first—at the architectural and chip level—and are now mass-manufacturing best-in-class quantum photonic chips at a leading US semiconductor fab. Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. “With this funding, we’re ready to take the next decisive steps to deliver the full potential of quantum computing.” Since its Series D funding in 2021, PsiQuantum has established a high-volume manufacturing process for its photonic chipset at GlobalFoundries’ facility in New York. A critical development is the integration of Barium Titanate (BTO) into its production line. BTO plays a crucial role in optical switches necessary for scaling optical quantum computing. The latest funding is expected to help the firm to further scale up the production of BTO towards the volumes required for utility-scale quantum computing. PsiQuantum manufactures BTO wafers in California before integrating them with those produced at GlobalFoundries. Nvidia’s venture capital arm, NVentures, is also among the new investors in PsiQuantum. The quantum company has also entered into a partnership with Nvidia, which spans several areas, including quantum algorithms, software development, and graphics processing unit (GPU)-quantum processing unit (QPU) integration. This collaboration supports advancements in PsiQuantum’s silicon photonics platform. Additionally, the firm is said to be actively working on systems that do not rely on traditional cryostats. Instead, it has developed a high-density cooling solution similar to data centre racks, capable of accommodating multiple quantum chips. Earlier in 2025, PsiQuantum completed the research phase of US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) Underexplored Systems for Utility-Scale Quantum Computing (US2QC) programme. The project now moves into the validation phase under DARPA’s Quantum Benchmarking Initiative. This phase will evaluate system design, component performance, and application use cases, marking a significant step towards realising commercially viable quantum computing systems.

Check out our Live Next Crypto to Explode Updates for September 11, 2025! Crypto is so unthinkably huge at the moment, a nearly $4 trillion industry that’s aiming for world domination. Recent headlines talk of Circle and Mastercard planning to add USDC to global payment systems, Ethereum and Bitcoin treasuries in the billions of dollars, and Google building its own blockchain. Bitcoin has an all-time growth of over 180,000,000%, Dogecoin over 43,000%, and some of the newest presale coins often pump 10x, 100x, or even 1,000x on rare occasions. Explosive potential is probably the single best description for what we’re seeing today in crypto. Quick Picks for Coins with Explosive Potential If you’re looking for the most recent insights on the next crypto to explode, stay tuned. We update this page frequently throughout the day, as we get the latest and greatest insider insights for chart sniffers and traders looking for the next coin to explode. September 11, 2025 • 15:00 UTC Some of the biggest companies in Asia are embracing crypto. First up, South Korea’s e-commerce giant Coupang is teaming up with the blockchain Tempo. This hints at the possibility of stablecoins being used for payments, saving hundreds of billions of won a year. Then, over in Japan, they’ve launched the first-ever credit card that lets you use stablecoins to pay your bills. The new Nudge Card system uses a yen-backed stablecoin, so now you can use it for repayments anywhere that takes VISA. With all the big-name adoption and market attention, it poses the question: which project will be the next crypto to explode? PepeNode ($PEPENODE) is a prime candidate, as it’s creating a mine-to-earn game where you can earn rewards without needing expensive hardware. Find out how to buy $PEPENODE and don’t miss the chance for 1388% staking rewards. September 11, 2025 • 14:07 UTC Users on CoinMarketCap are theorizing that altcoin season might be coming – Ethereum inflows topped Bitcoin inflows in August. According to them, this has often preceded altcoin pumps. And if we’re talking altcoins, then we can’t help but mention Maxi Doge ($MAXI), a fresh meme coin on presale that’s ready to take over Dogecoin’s crown as the memecoin king. Our Maxi Doge price prediction forecasts a price of $0.0024 by the end of 2025, roughly +848% from current prices. September 11, 2025 • 13:00 UTC The US Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Paul Atkins declared that ‘crypto’s time has come,’ during his keynote address at the OECD Roundtable on Global Financial Markets held in Paris yesterday. He reiterated that the US government’s commitment is to make the country the world’s crypto capital. To achieve this, Atkins emphasized the need to ‘provide certainty regarding the security status of crypto assets.’ With legislation such as the GENIUS Act, the US is inching closer to achieving this goal. In addition, this paves the way for the next crypto to explode, like Pepenode ($PEPENODE). The token will power its planned virtual mining ecosystem, allowing individuals to mine crypto without any equipment. With mining becoming more complex and requiring expensive specialized equipment, Pepenode can help democratize this crucial process in the world of cryptocurrencies. Learn how to get your tokens in our ‘How to Buy Pepenode’ guide. September 11, 2025 • 12:00 UTC Apple is gearing up to launch the iPhone 17. Not only is it attracting attention over its new camera and ceramic shield, but it’ll also help crypto enthusiasts avoid potential threats. By enabling an A19 chip that enables Memory Integrity Enforcement (MIE), the new mobile device will make it difficult for scammers to steal private keys and digital assets. Given that private key compromises were the largest single cause of stolen assets across the entire industry last year at 43.8%, its tech has never been more necessary for crypto lovers. Still, you can protect your assets even further by downloading Best Wallet on your iPhone. As a non-custodial wallet, it ensures only you have control over your private keys so that no third party can access your funds. And, suppose you happen to lose your recovery phrase or seed phrase, don’t worry: it also has secure cloud backup storage. It’s also multi-chain, featuring cutting-edge features like a swap function, and an upcoming crypto debit card – and that’s just the beginning. The project’s native token – $BEST – fuels these developments, as 25% of its total token supply will go toward product expansion. It also grants lower gas fees, staking rewards, governance rights, and exclusive access to presales. So, it’s no wonder that it’s anticipated to be the next crypto to explode. Read our Best Wallet review for more information. September 11, 2025 • 11:07 UTC BNB hit an all-time high of $907 yesterday, almost immediately after Binance announced a partnership with Franklin Templeton. The goal – new crypto initiatives and products. The collaboration looks to combine Binance’s global infrastructure with Franklin Templeton’s tokenization expertise to deliver a deadly combo of efficiency and accessibility. Roger Bayston, Head of Digital Assets at Franklin Templeton, said this: By working with Binance, we can deliver breakthrough products that meet the requirements of global capital markets and co-create the portfolios of the future. —Roger Bayston, Binance Blog Post This has sent BNB exploding by almost 6% in the last day, with a 64% increase in its 24h trading volume. Similarly, altcoins are ready to explode, and meme coins as well. One meme coin in particular that traders are watching is Maxi Doge ($MAXI), Dogecoin’s wilder, younger cousin that wants to dethrone the king. How, you ask? Lots of Red Bull, steroids, and sleepless nights scalping shitcoins hoping to make a fortune and get ahead. And the degen attitude is working – one whale bought $37.3K $MAXI. Here’s how to buy Maxi Doge if you plan on joining this train that’s on fire. September 11, 2025 • 10:00 UTC PumpSwap ($PUMP) is back in the spotlight, surging 41.6% this week to a $5.8B valuation – its highest since launch. After dipping to $2.4B last month, the Solana-based memecoin launchpad has rallied 133%, powered by a bold buyback strategy: 100% of daily revenue goes toward repurchasing $PUMP, offsetting over 6% of supply to date. With PumpSwap stacking $298M in TVL and ranking 2nd in spot DEX revenue, it’s clear: the degens are back, and they’re hungry. But while $PUMP’s riding high, the real sleeper play is PepeNode ($PEPENODE). With nearly $975K already raised in presale, it introduces a Mine-to-Earn model where users build virtual mining rigs, upgrade nodes, and earn rewards before the token even hits exchanges. It’s gamified staking meets DeFi, with 1414% APY, 70% burn mechanics, and referral bonuses that fuel viral growth. No hardware, no waiting, just strategy and community. If you missed the $PUMP rally, PepeNodes might be your chance at the next crypto to explode. Find out how to buy PepeNode from the presale for just $0.0010533 September 11, 2025 • 10:00 UTC New ETFs from Rex and Osprey are launching this week. They’re not your typical Bitcoin funds: they’re ETFs for popular altcoins like KRP, Dogecoin, and Bonk. It’s a big deal as the SEC has given them the green light by allowing them to pass their 75-day review window. The project’s focus on futures contracts holds them to an older law. But the SEC has kept major players like BlackRock stuck in a regulatory waiting game as they focus on the actual crypto. The move could open the floodgates for mainstream investors who want to get into crypto without buying tokens directly. And speaking of getting in on the action, the Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) project is making waves. It’s a community built to help you get an edge. They’ve created the Wepe Army, a group that shares expert insights and alpha calls, which is insider info that can give you a leg up on the market. $WEPE is even rewarding members for their social activity, creating a collective of people working to outsmart the big players. Learn how to buy the $WEPE token with our ‘How to Buy Wall Street Pepe’ guide.
