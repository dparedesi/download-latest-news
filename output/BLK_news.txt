Title: U.S. Economy Shrank During 2025’s First Quarter As GDP Slipped 0.3%

As recession fears reverberate from Washington to Wall Street, Wednesday brought the most comprehensive yardstick yet of the health of the U.S. economy yet as the government released the first estimate of the country’s gross domestic product over the first three months of 2025. Some measures tracking U.S. economic activity predict the U.S. economy actually shrank during the ... More first three months of 2025. Pictured is the Port of Long Beach. Real gross domestic product (GDP) grew -0.3% on a quarter-over-quarter, seasonally adjusted annual rate, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. That is the weakest economic growth for the U.S. since 2022’s first quarter. Consensus economist forecasts pegged last quarter’s real GDP growth at 0.4%, according to Dow Jones data, a stark decrease from the prior period’s 2.4% expansion. Data from sources following underlying measures of economic activity suggested Wednesday’s GDP reading could be even worse than that; the Atlanta Federal Reserve’s GDPNow model called for -0.4% GDP during Q1 when excluding gold imports and exports, while Goldman Sachs’ tracker indicates a 0.2% contraction. The BEA said the negative GDP reading “primarily reflected” an increase in imports, which surged as businesses aimed to front run tariffs, and a decrease in government spending. Futures tied to all three major indexes slid Wednesday morning following the GDP report. Contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average indicated a 380-point, or 0.9%, drop for the index, while S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures declined 1.4% and 1.9%, respectively. Negative GDP growth is rare for the U.S., occurring just three times over the last decade: 2020’s first two quarters as the COVID-19 pandemic ground the global economy to a halt, including a record 28% GDP contraction during the second quarter, and Q1 2022, when the Fed enacted its first interest rate hike in more than three years as inflation soared to a multidecade high. The U.S. will be one step closer to entering a recession, at least by one definition. A technical recession occurs when economic output contracts over consecutive quarters, meaning a negative reading during the second quarter would indicate such a downturn. The National Bureau of Economic Research defines a recession as “a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months,” meaning consecutive quarters of slightly negative GDP growth may not officially trigger a recession. Some trusted observers of the economy believe the U.S. could already be on the cusp of a recession, such as BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, while major banks largely view it as a tossup whether or not the U.S. enters such a downturn, including the U.S.’ largest bank JPMorgan Chase, whose economists forecast a 60% chance of a recession this year. The GDP reading comes as economists debate the growing disconnect between “hard” and “soft” economic metrics. Hard data such as job growth and retail sales indicate a steady economy while survey-based measures reveal Americans’ faith in the economy has dropped precipitously, as the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment poll revealed the weakest sentiment since July 2022. The disconnect comes as Trump has pursued the most aggressive tariffs since before World War I during the early stages of his second term. The ever-changing nature of Trump’s trade stances have also complicated analysis of the regularly scheduled updates on the U.S. economy. For example, this week’s GDP reading includes data through March 31 – two days before Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcement which triggered historic stock market losses, and nine days before Trump backpedaled on many of his most aggressive country-by-country import taxes. “Tariffs function like a tax hike, tighten financial conditions, and increase uncertainty for businesses,” Goldman economists led by David Mericle wrote in a Sunday note to clients, explaining how the levies weigh on GDP growth.

Title: Tokenized Apollo Credit Fund Makes DeFi Debut With Levered-Yield Strategy by Securitize, Gauntlet

DUBAI, UAE — Tokenization firm Securitize and decentralized finance (DeFi) specialist Gauntlet are planning to bring a tokenized version of Apollo's credit fund to DeFi, a notable step in embedding real-world assets into the crypto ecosystem. The two firms are unveiling Wednesday a leveraged-yield strategy offering centered on the Apollo Diversified Credit Securitize Fund (ACRED), a tokenized feeder fund that debuted in January and invests in Apollo’s $1 billion Diversified Credit Fund. The strategy will run on Compound Blue, a lending protocol powered by Morpho, The offering, called Levered RWA Strategy, will be first available on Polygon (POL). It is expected to expand to the Ethereum mainnet and other blockchains after a pilot phase. "The idea behind the product is we want our securities to be plug and play competitive with stablecoin strategies writ large," Reid Simon, head of DeFi and credit solutions at Securitize, said in an interview with CoinDesk. The introduction comes as tokenized RWAs — funds, bonds, credit products — gain traction among traditional finance giants. BlackRock, HSBC, and Franklin Templeton are among the firms exploring blockchain-based asset issuance and settlement. Tokenized U.S. Treasuries alone have pulled in over $6 billion, according to data from RWA.xyz. While institutions are experimenting with tokenization, the next challenge is making these assets usable across DeFi applications. That includes enabling their use as collateral for loans, margin trading or building investment strategies not possible on legacy rails. The strategy employs a DeFi-native yield-optimization technique called "looping", in which ACRED tokens deposited into a vault are used as collateral to borrow USDC, which is then used to purchase more ACRED. The process repeats recursively to enhance yield, with exposure adjusted dynamically based on real-time borrowing and lending rates. All trades are automated using smart contracts, reducing the need for manual oversight. Risk is actively managed by Gauntlet’s risk engine, which monitors leverage ratios and can unwind positions in volatile market conditions to protect users. "This is expected to deliver the institutional-grade DeFi that our industry has promised for years," Morpho CEO and cofounder Paul Frambot said. "This use case uniquely demonstrates how DeFi enables investors in funds like ACRED to access financial composability that is simply not possible on traditional rails.” The vault is also one of the first uses of Securitize’s new sToken tool, which allows accredited token holders to maintain compliance and investor protections within decentralized networks. In this case, ACRED investors first mint sACRED that they can use for broader DeFi strategies without breaking regulatory rules. "This is a strong example of the institutional-grade DeFi we’ve been working to build: making tokenized securities not only accessible, but compelling to crypto-native investors seeking strategies that objectively outpace their traditional counterparts,” Securitize CEO Carlos Domingo said in a statement.

Libre and the TON Foundation are collaborating to create a $500 million Telegram Bond Fund ($TBF) on the TON blockchain, marking one of the largest tokenised corporate debt ventures in history. The RWA narrative just got a huge push as @librecap & TON Foundation are tokenizing $500M of Telegram bonds on TON Blockchain via the Telegram Bond Fund ($TBF)! 🔥 Key points:💼$500M in Telegram bonds on TON🏦Access for institutional & accredited investors⚡Powered by Libre… pic.twitter.com/nXOdSsatKN — TON 💎 (@ton_blockchain) April 30, 2025 In a blog on TON’s website, Max Crown, the CEO of the TON Foundation, underscores that this collaboration “unlocks powerful new opportunities for TON’s community to engage with real-world assets in a secure and accessible way,” solidifying TON’s leadership in regulated asset tokenisation. By digitising a slice of Telegram’s $2.35 billion in outstanding bonds, $TBF offers accredited investors an unprecedented on-chain gateway to institutional-grade fixed-income products with yields reaching up to 9.4%. The new fund introduces seamless subscription, redemption, and transfer capabilities through its multi-phase Libre Gateway infrastructure, leveraging Libre’s proven track record, which has tokenised over $200 million in assets alongside titans like BlackRock and Brevan Howard. With TON’s deep integration into Telegram’s ecosystem of over 950 million users, investors can now access and manage their tokenised bond holdings directly from TON-native wallets, bridging the gap between fiat, stablecoins, and decentralised finance. Through $TBF, tokenised bonds can serve not only as yield-bearing instruments but also as on-chain collateral for borrowing, yield farming, and a growing array of decentralised finance (DeFi) products built on TON’s scalable network. Dr. Jez Mohideen, Chairman of Libre and CEO of Laser Digital, emphasises that TON’s unique symbiosis of mass-market usability and institutional infrastructure creates “a seamless bridge between TradFi and DeFi for a global, digitally native audience.” The launch arrives amid an $18.9 billion surge in real-world asset tokenisation, where corporate debt has historically lagged behind commodities and real estate, positioning $TBF as a catalyst for broader market adoption. By enabling future issuances of Telegram bonds to flow through the same compliant, on-chain framework, Libre and the TON Foundation are laying the groundwork for an enduring ecosystem of digital debt markets. Institutional participants can now tap into a fully on-chain issuance stack that promises transparency, efficiency, and regulatory compliance, while retail users stand to benefit from a new frontier of yield and utility seamlessly embedded in their favourite messaging app. Keep updated with our round the clock and in-depth cryptocurrency news Keep updated with our round the clock and in-depth cryptocurrency news Please be aware that some of the links on this site will direct you to the websites of third parties, some of whom are marketing affiliates and/or business partners of this site and/or its owners, operators and affiliates.

Title: ‘Changing Fast’—Bitcoin Is Suddenly Braced For A $10 Trillion Wall Street ETF Price Boom

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. Bitcoin has recovered this month from a sell-off that had threatened to spiral into a full blown price crash—supported by the Federal Reserve quietly priming the bitcoin price and crypto market. Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has soared toward $100,000 per bitcoin, up from April lows of around $75,000, as it hurtles toward what bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) giant BlackRock has called a “geopolitical fragmentation megaforce" shock. Now, as a leak reveals growing establishment fears over U.S. president Donald Trump’s bitcoin and crypto plans, Wall Street giants that manage a combined $10 trillion on behalf of clients are predicted to "open for business" on bitcoin this year. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, has led the Wall Street rush into bitcoin, helping to ... More boost the bitcoin price. “The big four wirehouses—Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo and UBS—control over $10 trillion in client assets, and by and large, these platforms have not yet allowed their advisors to easily access bitcoin ETFs,” Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan wrote in a note, adding he believes “that’s changing fast.” “In fact, I suspect all four wirehouses will be open for business on bitcoin ETFs by the end of the year.” So far, the fleet of spot bitcoin ETFs that took Wall Street by storm last year have not had access to the wirehouses network of financial advisors that offer investment and wealth management services. Last year, Morgan Stanley did allow advisors to pitch BlackRock and Fidelity’s market-leading bitcoin ETFs to clients with a net worth of at least $1.5 million last August but Hougan expects this to open up to the wider market in 2025. “It’s one of the reasons I still expect bitcoin ETFs to set a new record for net inflows this year, despite pulling in “just” $3.7 billion so far in 2025, compared to $35 billion in 2024,” he wrote. The dozen U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs, which rocketed to assets under management of more than $100 billion last year, raked in more than $3 billion last week, according to data from SoSoValue, marking a return to growth after a recent period of outflows that mirrored the stock market’s volatility. The return of inflows to bitcoin ETFs has embolden bullish traders who are betting the bitcoin price could be headed higher. "Bitcoin continues to outperform," David Morrison, senior market analyst at Trade Nation, said via email. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has bounced back from a steep sell-off. "Bitcoin is currently consolidating around $95,000, taking it back within sight of the $100,000 level. Bitcoin’s recent price action may serve as a broader sentiment gauge for risk assets." While traders are feeling upbeat, they have also cautioned the market could retreat back to the mid-$80,000s. “The overall outlook for bitcoin remains bullish,” Arthur Azizov, founder of B2 Ventures, said in emailed comments. “Right now, bitcoin is pushing toward a new all-time high, but we shouldn’t rule out minor pullbacks as part of a healthy correction–something that naturally accompanies any reasonable growth. At this stage, bitcoin is in a key zone, having just swept liquidity at the top. That makes a short-term correction quite likely. If that happens, it would make sense to expect a retracement into the $86,000–$83,000 range.”

Title: Bitcoin expected to beat stalling US GDP growth trend as Q1 data is released later today

Bitcoin's appeal as a macro hedge grows amid US economic slowdown and inflation concerns. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. [Update: GDP came in well under estimates, contracting by 0.3%.] At 08:30 ET today, the Bureau of Economic Analysis is set to release its advance estimate for US Q1 GDP, with consensus expectations at a 0.3% seasonally adjusted annual rate. If confirmed, this would mark the weakest quarterly print since early 2022 and contrast starkly with the inflow of over $3 billion into spot Bitcoin ETFs last week, reflecting what some market participants interpret as a pivot in capital preference toward digital assets amid macroeconomic stagnation. [Editor’s Note: Q1 GDP will not include tariff impact as the cut-off date came before ‘Liberation Day.’] GDP forecasts show a stark divide. The Atlanta Fed’s Nowcast has called a contraction of 2.7%, while the Philadelphia Fed’s model projects growth of 2.5%, last updated on Feb. 14. Regardless of the final figure, the drag from the record goods-trade deficit is a common feature across estimates, with some models attributing up to 1.9 percentage points of negative contribution to it. This trade shortfall appears to be a delayed consequence of tariff front-loading, spurring preemptive imports during the prior quarter. Inventories are expected to be flat, while consumer sentiment continues to deteriorate, hitting a five-year low. Business capital expenditure has also been curtailed. Inflationary persistence further complicates the picture. March’s Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% year-over-year, and the Core PCE index, the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge, stood at 2.8% in February. Interest rate futures now price in over 90% probability of a rate cut by December. Concurrently, Treasury yields have declined and the dollar has weakened, reinforcing stagflation comparisons with the 1970s as economic growth stalls and inflation remains above target. Bitcoin’s market setup diverges notably from the traditional macro picture. Realized capitalization for the top digital asset continues to make new all-time highs, currently at $883 billion and signaling continued inflows despite the pullback from January’s price peak. Data show that approximately 20,000 BTC exited exchanges in the past week, the highest weekly net outflow in two years, primarily driven by whale accumulation of 19,255 BTC. Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin ETFs captured $3.4 billion in inflows, the third-largest weekly intake to date. BlackRock’s IBIT alone recorded $643 million on April 23, its second-largest single-day inflow. Volatility metrics suggest a broader evolution in market structure. Realized volatility has compressed by roughly 50% from its 2022 peaks, and the volatility spread between Bitcoin and the Nasdaq now sits near cycle lows. This compression has lent credence to characterizations of Bitcoin as a maturing asset class, a view reinforced by VanEck’s observation that its volatility and co-movement profile increasingly resemble that of gold rather than equities. The juxtaposition between a near-stalling US economy and a record-high cumulative invested cost in Bitcoin reflects diverging narratives around capital preservation. The trade deficit drag highlights the limitations of a tariff-distorted goods economy, while Bitcoin’s borderless framework offers a contrasting vehicle for global allocation. The backdrop of tepid growth and elevated inflation has reopened discourse around digital assets as potential stagflation hedges, particularly as ETF demand endures despite recessionary signals. With major funds from the likes of BlackRock and Fidelity continuing to absorb supply, flows into digital assets show resilience that is disconnected from conventional macro indicators. Market participants now look toward the May 1 Core PCE update and next week’s FOMC decision for further clarity on rate trajectory and inflation conditions.

Title: How Stablecoins, Blockchain-Based Payment Networks Could Reshape Global Finance
URL: https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbesfinancecouncil/2025/04/30/how-stablecoins-blockchain-based-payment-networks-could-reshape-global-finance/
Time Published: 2025-04-30T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
ByChuck Zhang ByChuck Zhang, Forbes Councils Member. Chuck Zhang, CFO of PolyFlow, Payment Infrastructure for Web3.0. Stablecoins have witnessed a remarkable surge, surpassing a total market value of $230 billion as of this writing. Just five years ago, they were in their infancy. Now, these digital currencies are transforming global finance by simplifying transactions, expediting cross-border trade and facilitating remittances. Stablecoins are digital currencies that are typically pegged to fiat currencies such as the U.S. dollar (USD) at a 1:1 ratio. They are issued on blockchain networks such as Ethereum and Tron, combining the advantages of blockchain technology with the stability required for practical digital currency applications. According to Visa’s stablecoin dashboard, even after adjusting for automated transactions, stablecoins settled over $6.5 trillion in the past 12 months. Initially serving as a bridge for crypto assets, stablecoins have evolved and are integrating into everyday transactions beyond the crypto market. Traditional financial institutions and regulators are rapidly adopting blockchain technology. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) is exploring the idea of a “Finternet,” the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has announced Global Layer One and Deutsche Bank is working on Layer 2 solutions. Asset management giants including BlackRock and Franklin Templeton are also experimenting with public blockchains. Stablecoins make value transfer seamless, enabling real-time global transactions at lower costs than traditional banking rails. For consumers, the ability to receive funds instantly with minimal friction is more important than understanding blockchain’s decentralized principles. Just as we use SWIFT without knowing its intricacies, stablecoins can be embedded into mainstream applications, making blockchain an invisible but integral part of payments. The next major trend is the migration of Web2 applications to Web3, similar to how businesses transitioned from desktop to mobile a decade ago. Blockchain-based payments will increasingly be embedded in applications as stablecoin solutions, making digital assets more accessible to the average user. Major financial institutions have validated the rise of stablecoins. PayPal launched PYUSD on a public blockchain, Stripe acquired stablecoin company Bridge for $1.1 billion, Visa partnered with Circle for USDC settlements and Revolut is said to have its own stablecoin plans. Throughout history, the form and function of money have evolved with the times, and in this digital economy era, stablecoins are spreading rapidly. Just as ordinary users can see PYUSD stablecoins in the PayPal apps, in the near future, I expect we will see various stablecoins in more existing mobile payment applications, contributing to the free transfer of value. Some argue that blockchain-based payment networks threaten traditional financial systems. However, the bigger picture suggests that traditional institutions can leverage blockchain for efficiency and cost savings. Through current trends, we can anticipate several points for the future development of stablecoins: The current stablecoin market is dominated by a few major issuers, but this is likely to change. A more fragmented landscape of interoperable stablecoins will likely emerge, similar to how different commercial banks issue dollars. This shift could reduce costs, increase speed and expand access to stablecoin-based payments. As stablecoin issuers multiply, interoperability will become crucial. A new market segment—stablecoin orchestration—will facilitate seamless transactions between different stablecoins, much like how Visa and Mastercard handle fiat transactions. If a customer wants to pay in one stablecoin but a merchant only accepts a different stablecoin, an orchestrator will enable instant conversion. Stripe’s acquisition of Bridge highlights the growing need for such interoperability. Despite the growth of blockchain-based payments, traditional payment systems such as SWIFT and Visa/Mastercard will not disappear overnight. Instead, blockchain solutions will complement legacy systems, integrating innovative technology to enhance financial services while bridging the gap between old and new payment infrastructures. Payment financing (PayFi), the fusion of blockchain payments and decentralized finance (DeFi), represents the next stage of financial evolution. By combining smart contracts with financial services, PayFi could enable new global financial products, including lending, wealth management and investment solutions—all anchored in stablecoin-based payments. This shift would expand financial inclusion and create new revenue streams within the digital economy. While gaining popularity for legitimate applications, stablecoins have also been misused by high-risk and bad actors for illicit activities such as money laundering and sanctions evasion. Their stable value and global accessibility make them appealing to those seeking to circumvent financial regulations and avoid detection. The healthy development of the stablecoin ecosystem requires coordinated efforts among international regulators. Clear regulations are essential, and the progression of the U.S. Stable Act is expected to encourage more traditional financial institutions to engage in the compliant stablecoin market, thereby further fostering the industry’s healthy and positive growth. Stablecoins are ushering in an era of permissionless, scalable and instant payments, lowering friction and unlocking new business opportunities. As traditional payments, stablecoins and blockchain networks continue to integrate, stablecoins will play a central role in cross-border fund transfers, digital capital markets and financial services for underbanked populations. While blockchain technology moves behind the scenes, stablecoins are taking center stage.

Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has made additional moves to incorporate blockchain technology into its traditional finance operations. According to an April 28 filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the firm seeks approval to introduce a blockchain-enabled share class, referred to as “DLT Shares,” tied to its $150 billion money market fund. According to the filing, The Bank of New York Mellon (BNY Mellon) will manage the sale of these shares and maintain a mirrored record of ownership using blockchain technology. The filing stated: “DLT Shares may also be purchased by BlackRock Advisors, LLC or its affiliates. Although the Fund does not currently employ blockchain technology or invest in crypto assets, DLT Shares are expected to be purchased and held through BNY, which intends to use blockchain technology to maintain a mirror record of share ownership for its customers.” The filing did not name the blockchain network the bank would utilize. However, it has used Ethereum in the past. Meanwhile, the minimum investment for this new share class is $3 million. The fund will allocate its assets across US Treasury securities, including bills, notes, and similar obligations. It will focus on short-term investments, maintaining a dollar-weighted average maturity of no more than 60 days and an average life of under 120 days. BlackRock’s latest move reflects its increasing interest in blockchain technology, especially following the success of its Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and BUIDL fund. The unprecedented success of these products has resulted in industry leaders forecasting long-term dominance for BlackRock’s ETFs. Michael Saylor, executive chairman of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), recently suggested that the firm’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) could become the largest ETF globally within the next ten years. Beyond ETFs, BlackRock is also actively working on asset tokenization. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has outlined a vision where all assets, including stocks and real estate, are digitized and transacted via blockchain. According to him: “Some investments produce much higher returns than others, but only big investors can get into them. One reason? Friction. Legal, operational, bureaucratic. Tokenization strips that away, allowing more people access to potentially higher returns.” Notably, BlackRock is already utilizing these ideas through its blockchain-native BUIDL fund, which was launched in partnership with Securitize in 2024. The fund manages over $2.5 billion in tokenized assets and has expanded operations to several blockchain networks, including Solana, Avalanche, and Ethereum layer-2 networks like Optimism.

Title: MF1’s Scott Waynebern and Eric Draeger on Carving a Multifamily Lending Niche
URL: http://commercialobserver.com/2025/04/mf1-scott-waynebern-eric-draeger-multifamily/
Time Published: 2025-04-30T10:00:18Z
Full Content:
© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy Scott Waynebern’s Midtown South Manhattan office serves as an homage to his commercial real estate finance journey — up to and including the launch eight years ago of multifamily lender MF1 as a joint venture between Limekiln Real Estate and Berkshire Residential Investments. Waynebern has a series of must-read books on the shelves of his open office setup for anyone pursuing a career in lending, such as The Big Short by Michael Lewis and Larry Silverstein’s The Rising, that spotlight some of the market cycles and crashes that have transpired over the course of his more than 30-year CRE career, starting as a senior analyst at Salomon Brothers. “The office is meant to share, and I believe strongly in transparency, communication and mentorship,” Waynebern said. “These books about the purchase and financing of the GM Building or about Peter Cooper Village or the World Trade Center or long-term capital management can show the younger generation that these stories they hear about, that seem too fantastic to be true, really did happen, so it serves as a bit of a lending library.” After five years at Salomon Brothers, Waynebern joined Deutsche Bank in 1996 and spent 14 years with the investment banking giant heading up real estate capital markets and its CRE special situations group. It was at Deutsche Bank that Waynebern met Eric Draeger, chief investment officer at Berkshire, setting the stage for the eventual creation of MF1. Following a two-year stint as president of Limekiln, Waynebern became head of CRE at Benefit Street Partners. It was there while lending within multiple property sectors that he decided a strictly multifamily route was the best path forward. He restarted Limekiln and linked up with Draeger to form MF1. The duo have been thriving while focusing exclusively on residential rental assets, closing $4 billion of multifamily loans for the year ending March 1, 2025, a 48 percent yearly bump. Waynebern and Draeger, who is based in Boston, met with Commercial Observer on April 8 at MF1’s Manhattan office at 41 Madison Avenue to discuss the origins of the alternative lender, the experience of navigating challenging markets like 2008’s Global Financial Crisis (GFC), and the decision to lean all in on multifamily lending. The interview has been edited for length and clarity. Commercial Observer: What was your initial path into working in commercial real estate finance? Scott Waynebern: I did a year of business school at Kellogg in Chicago, and the CEO of Freddie Mac at the time [Leland C. Brendsel] sponsored a securitization symposium one night a week. He had an incredible group of people like Larry Fink [CEO of BlackRock] come out to Chicago and present to us. This was in 1996 at the beginning of this big wave of securitization, and that helped inspire me a little bit. I was familiar with it from my time at Salomon Brothers, but that really clued me into it. I then started at Deutsche Bank after business school, and because it was an open playing field — just as Deutsche Bank was starting their fixed- income business — I was able to say to them “I’ve got very good qualitative skills but I’m not good enough at math to compete on Treasurys or mortgages. But there’s this new product, CMBS, which looks like a great mix of them where you need to be pretty good at both.” Being somebody who lived in New York and was fascinated by New York real estate, it seemed really tangible and exciting. And, because it was the early days of Deutsche Bank in that training program, I was able to say I wanted to work on that desk. So, you knew you wanted to work in finance but weren’t sure about commercial real estate finance until later? Waynebern: That’s right. And what was incredible is, if you go back, there was such a deep crash in real estate from the changing of the tax rules and the savings and loan crisis in the late `80s, early `90s. On the rebound from that crisis there was a magnet for talent with a lot of people I went to college with or grew up with in the early `90s being pulled into commercial real estate. That actually helped create a pretty amazing network. Eric Draeger: I did not intend to do real estate. At Northwestern I took a class in real estate and didn’t like it. I went to work for a law firm and I was the only one who could do real math, so I ended up working on financing real estate with the partners. My wife was living in London at the same time Scott was working there, coincidentally, and I was going to see her and then stopped in Chicago to meet the originator who did the loans for us and had dinner with him. When I came back, he asked if I could have dinner again and offered me a job and I took it. My first year was at Berkshire Mortgage in Chicago. I moved to Boston about a year later and have been in multifamily finance ever since. How did you two begin working together? Waynebern: In 2004, the team I was a part of at Deutsche Bank bought Berkshire Mortgage from founding owners George and Douglas Krupp, and Eric and I worked very closely together in terms of integrating that business into this broad global commercial real estate finance platform. At the first post-merger integration meeting, I stood up in front of all of Berkshire Mortgage and said, “You’re part of a trillion-dollar bank balance sheet now, so what do you want?” And every originator’s hand shot up and said, “We want bridge loans to compete with the banks that have Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac licenses that can also provide this other product.” Eric and I and his partner Jon Pfeil and a couple other folks put together a program to originate multifamily bridge loans in support of a Fannie and Freddie lender which was then owned by Deutsche Bank. We didn’t start lending until the absolute peak of the market in 2006 to 2007. We did have the foresight to stop lending relatively early in 2007 after a really legendary meeting with one of the chief credit guys at Freddie Mac, who told us this market doesn’t look good anymore. We came home and cut off the lending but we didn’t lose any money, despite lending at the absolute top of the market and going into the epic GFC crash. When the opportunity presented itself in 2017 to put the band back together again and do the same program, that was the idea behind MF1. In 2018, MF1 had not made a loan yet and today we have more bridge loans on our book than any publicly traded commercial mortgage REIT. It’s because we’ve scaled businesses before, and we learned what to do and, probably more importantly, what not to do. What was the process like of starting MF1 in 2017? Waynebern: It came together shockingly fast. For a variety of reasons it was time to move on from Benefit Street Partners. As I was thinking about what to do next, I was thinking if I wanted to do something like that again — doing every asset class and multiple types of lending — and somebody asked me a question. They said, “What if you only had $250 million of equity — what would be your best idea or two?” I said, “That’s easy, it would be a multifamily bridge loan business.” The second question was asking ourselves “Who do we want to partner with?” and that’s when we said, “Let’s run it back.” We had a choice at the time of basically “I’ll write you essentially a half-a-billion-dollar equity check to beta test the business and then go out and run a fund” or we could do it with Berkshire without a big check up front — but with trust because it’s so core to what they do. Also, we worked together in good times and in a crisis, and I wanted to do it again. I think most people’s advice is to take the money, but I wanted to make sure it really worked. Draeger: The other thing to add to that is we both understand the other side. Theoretically, I’m real estate and he’s capital markets, but we both can do each other’s jobs. When you speak the same language it makes it a lot easier to understand what the other person is saying. What led to your strict focus on multifamily? Waynebern: I made a top-down credit call in 2017 for the Limekiln business to short office, retail and hotel. And the reason was that I felt like I no longer knew how to underwrite office. I didn’t think it was necessarily going down, but I just knew I didn’t understand it anymore. Layered on top of that was unknowns about the uses of office and whether it was server rooms disappearing in favor of the cloud, or people sitting closer together and knowing there’s going to be less space per employee. I also knew how difficult it was for my team to underwrite retail with all the questions I had about space becoming available. When it came to the multifamily sector, we had a lot of connectivity and a connection with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, because at Deutsche Bank we were the only big bank with a really active Fannie-Freddie business. Freddie Mac hired Eric and I to be the bankers to shepherd them into the CMBS world. We helped them create the K-series [Freddie Mac’s CMBS business] and, as part of that, we ended up purchasing the first Freddie Mac B-piece in the summer 2009 — the absolute bottom of the GFC. Fifty percent went into a vehicle I controlled at Deutsche Bank, and the other 50 percent went into the Krupp family real estate investment trust. So that was kind of a landmark transaction not only for each of our careers and each of our organizations, but, frankly, for the multifamily sector and commercial real estate sector as that Freddie Mac program became the single biggest thing in the CMBS market. If you believed in multifamily credit enough to buy subordinate, securitized risk in August of 2009, that shows a lot of conviction. When we came together, we said we’re going to work together on all things housing, but agreed to separately compete in the Freddie Mac B-piece space. We have been active buyers of subordinate multifamily risk in that market consistently since 2009. Which geographic markets are drawing the most focus in multifamily now? Draeger: We tend to close more loans in areas we’ve been to, so we’re going to be in the top 30 markets more than not because that’s where the assets are. But we are relatively agnostic and will do multifamily housing in all of the U.S. What is your outlook on the Sun Belt multifamily market with some of the oversupply issues that have popped up over the last couple of years? Draeger: Our outlook is positive. Supply was definitely an issue for the last couple of years, but demand was amazingly strong as well, so nobody talks about that side of the equation. We’re seeing, generally speaking, recovery to almost normalization, so you aren’t seeing widespread issues on the supply-demand side even though there are some pockets in markets. There are definitely some markets that are softer, and we think those will improve as construction is slowing down pretty dramatically. We’ve been lending in the South, and are generally very positive about our performance. What’s your expectations for the demand for private credit as banks come back into the fold with lending? Draeger: There’s a need for all capital sources, from the safest to the most aggressive, so there is a wide range. I think everyone’s got their niche. The banks are going to play and we have seen more competition, but they’re going to play probably more to their footprints in areas they know, and follow some of the customers. With private credit we can do something a little bit different and it can be a little more creative. Waynebern: The banks are undergoing multiple changes, and one of the big ones is the capital rules. I think my experience at Salomon Brothers and working on their balance sheet and Deutsche Bank saying, “Let’s use the balance sheet really efficiently,” gave me a real insight into capital usage and return on equity within the bank. So, when you look at it now with the way the capital rules have changed, there’s a massive advantage to a bank being a lender to us and getting their exposure to commercial real estate via loan on loan, or a warehouse line versus direct lending. If you do the math, a lower spread being lent to us but using less equity will generate a higher return on equity for the bank than them making that same loan directly at a higher spread. That has changed over the seven years we’ve been doing this, and we’ve been a real beneficiary of that. What are your near-term or long-term goals for MF1? Waynebern: Our goal is to be the pre-eminent private lender to multifamily. To date, we have been almost exclusively originating floating-rate loans. We’ve closed our first few fixed-rate loans this year. We anticipated this year a shape of the curve where people would want fixed rate, and that hasn’t been the case. At some point, rates in the curve will move to where people want fixed rate, and we want to be prepared for that. Our goal is to keep adding new products to meet the demands of our customers. What do you enjoy outside of work? Waynebern: We enjoy golfing together and golf in general. Also playing sports with our kids. We are also both big basketball fans.

Dubbed the Telegram Bond Fund, the product allows institutional and accredited investors to gain exposure to Telegram’s outstanding bonds directly through the TON blockchain, according to a statement shared with Decrypt. The fund will also participate in future Telegram bond offerings and serve as collateral for borrowing and yield-generating strategies within the TON ecosystem. The TON Foundation says the launch is one of DeFi’s largest institutional RWA moves to date, in a sector projected to exceed $50 billion this year. The fund will be issued and managed using Libre’s infrastructure, which supports fiat and stablecoin subscriptions, redemptions, and secondary transfers under regulatory oversight. Investors will manage assets directly through TON-native wallets, according to Libre and the TON Foundation. TON, originally developed by Telegram, has operated independently since 2020 under the TON Foundation after regulatory pressure forced the company to abandon direct involvement. The Telegram app continues to integrate features that interact with the TON blockchain, including wallet access and username auctions. Both parties have said further regulated asset offerings are in development, with plans to expand tokenized access to a broader range of global financial products in the coming months. The Telegram Bond Fund has no connection to Libre, the Solana meme coin that briefly surged during the 2024 Argentine presidential campaign involving Javier Milei. Libre, the infrastructure provider in this offering, is a separate, regulated entity focused on institutional finance. The firm has previously tokenized over $200 million in assets from major institutions, including asset managers such as BlackRock, Brevan Howard, Hamilton Lane, and Nomura’s digital asset arm, Laser Digital. These tokenized funds will also become available on TON, providing access to a broader suite of institutional-grade financial products. “This collaboration brings together omni-chain institutional-grade infrastructure and mass-market blockchain usability,” said Dr. Jez Mohideen, Chairman of Libre and CEO of Laser Digital. Rising RWA popularity The launch comes amid a period of rising activity in the RWA space. BlackRock’s BUIDL fund, the largest tokenized U.S. Treasury product, has crossed over $2.5 billion in market capitalization, according to Dune Analytics data. The fund, launched last March in partnership with Securitize, has expanded across multiple blockchains, including Ethereum, Solana, Aptos, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Optimism, and Polygon. Stablecoin issuer Circle recently acquired Hashnote, the manager of the $1.25 billion USYC fund, with plans to connect it to its USDC ecosystem. In the Middle East, Dubai-based developer DAMAC signed a $1 billion deal with Mantra, a Layer-1 blockchain for RWAs, to tokenize real estate, data centers, and other physical assets. The total value locked in RWA protocols now exceeds $11.14 billion, more than doubling in the past year, according to DeFiLlama data. This shows the growing interest in firms for bringing traditional financial products like U.S. Treasuries, corporate bonds, and real estate into blockchain ecosystems that historically focused on crypto-native assets. The tokenized U.S. Treasury market has experienced significant growth, with a total value locked of approximately $6.16 billion, RWA.xyz data shows.

Title: SEC Filing Shows BlackRock Preparing $150 Billion Tokenized Treasury Trust Offering

BlackRock is preparing to bring blockchain to the back office of one of its largest funds, filing to offer a digital share class of its $150 billion Treasury Trust money market fund through BNY Mellon. The new “DLT Shares,” short for distributed ledger technology, won’t hold crypto. BNY Mellon, the fund’s exclusive distributor, intends to use blockchain to mirror share ownership records, an incremental step that could pave the way for broader adoption of tokenized cash, digital assets, or blockchain-based settlement infrastructure in traditional finance. In the past few years, a growing number of firms has experimented with creating blockchain-based representations of real world assets (RWAs), bringing the traditional finance world rapidly into the crypto and decentralized finance (DeFi) environment. Earlier Wednesday, Libre said it was tokenizing $500 million of messaging platform Telegram's $2.4 billion debt and bringing it to the TON blockchain. BlackRock's Liquidity Treasury Trust Fund is part of the firm’s Liquidity Funds suite and managed over $150 billion in assets as of April 29. The DLT share class has a minimum investment requirement of $3 million for institutional buyers, with no minimums on subsequent purchases. The SEC filing is preliminary and subject to approval. The move isn’t BlackRock’s first into tokenization. Its blockchain-native BUIDL fund, created in partnership with Securitize, now manages over $1.7 billion in assets and recently expanded onto Solana. CEO Larry Fink has consistently emphasized his belief in the long-term potential of tokenization and decentralized finance. In his 2025 annual letter to shareholders, Fink warned that the U.S. risks ceding its financial dominance if it fails to control its debt — a vulnerability that could accelerate investor interest in alternatives like bitcoin (BTC). “If the U.S. doesn’t get its debt under control … America risks losing [its reserve currency status] to digital assets like Bitcoin,” Fink wrote. “Decentralized finance is an extraordinary innovation. It makes markets faster, cheaper, and more transparent. Yet that same innovation could undermine America’s economic advantage.” UPDATE (April 30, 7:29 UTC): Adds third paragraph on tokenization trends, rewrites headline.

Libre, a tokenization firm that works closely with the likes of hedge fund Brevan Howard, investment management firm Hamilton Lane and Nomura's digital assets unit Laser Digital, plans to tokenize $500 million worth of Telegram debt as the blockchain-based Telegram Bond Fund (TBF) on the TON network that's linked to the messaging platform. TBF will offer accredited investors exposure to some of the around $2.35 billion of outstanding bonds issued by Telegram, providing institutional-grade yield products that will also be available as collateral for on-chain borrowing and product development on TON, Libre said. “What we’ve created is like a fixed income fund that acquires the bonds and then we tokenize the fund,” Libre CEO Avtar Sehra in an interview. “When you purchase units in the fund these are on the TON chain, giving you access to the returns of the underlying bonds themselves. This opens up opportunities to use the bonds for collateral, ease of transfers, etc, to ultimately create utility with these financial instruments.” The past year or two has seen a rush to create blockchain-based representations of real world assets (RWAs), bringing the traditional finance world rapidly within the ambit of crypto and decentralized finance (DeFi). Sehra said many of his customers want either tokenized money market products because they're looking for quick access to cash, or something that’s associated with an ecosystem they are involved in or work within. The TON network was originally developed by Telegram before continuing as an independent operation. Over the last year or so, TON has been focused on bringing a large swathe of Telegram’s 950 million-plus users on-chain. Libre has already tokenized over $200 million in assets across funds from leading institutions including BlackRock, Brevan Howard, Hamilton Lane, and Laser Digital. “Our objective isn't just to tokenize things for the sake of tokenizing them,” Sehra said. “I think the real value in tokenizing traditional financial instruments is unlocking the utility of those assets.” UPDATE (April. 30, 06:32 UTC): Changes the outstanding Telegram bonds figure to $2.35 billion Ian Allison is a senior reporter at CoinDesk, focused on institutional and enterprise adoption of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.

While we may not drill for oil, mine coal, or produce gas, Ireland has become a tax-friendly financial gateway for some of the most destructive industries on the planet, making us complicit in fuelling the global climate emergency. A new report released today, titled The Hidden Truth: Ireland’s Role in the Global Fossil Fuel Industry and based on research by ActionAid Ireland and Trócaire, reveals that as of June 2024, an astonishing €31 billion in fossil fuel investments were held by Irish-based financial institutions. Even more disturbing, 91% of that investment is tied to companies actively expanding fossil fuel operations in direct defiance of international scientific consensus on the need to limit global warming to 1.5°C. Trócaire and ActionAid witness the unequal impact of the climate crisis in the communities we work with every day, who are on the frontlines of the climate crisis, despite contributing the least to its causes. This is a profound climate injustice. Devastating floods, storms, cyclones, droughts, famine, biodiversity loss and ecosystem breakdowns are having a disastrous impact on the lives of billions of people worldwide. Climate disasters leave a litany of human rights impacts as livelihoods are destroyed, including disproportionately harming young girls and their access to education. 12-year-old Miriam from rural Guatemala and her family had their income decimated by a recent drought, which destroyed their crops. Miriam was due to go to secondary school, an hour drive away, but her parents cannot now afford the €5 a week for the bus that would take her there. File photo: Oil refinery Alamy Stock Photo Alamy Stock Photo Fossil fuels — coal, oil, and gas — account for over 75% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and nearly 90% of carbon dioxide emissions. They are the primary driver of climate change. But for investors, they remain staggeringly profitable, both for companies and their investors. That’s why billions continue to be funnelled through Ireland to the very companies accelerating planetary collapse. Our report names some of the financial heavyweights with significant fossil fuel-related holdings domiciled in Ireland. The top three firms are: BlackRock (€18.4 billion), State Street (€4.3 billion) and Crédit Agricole (€2.1 billion). Advertisement File photo - Ocean Rebellion activists stage a dramatic demonstration outside Unitied Nations agency. Alamy Stock Photo Alamy Stock Photo Ireland’s status as a conduit for climate-wrecking capital is the result of deliberate policy decisions and the outcome of our Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) model and weak national and EU regulations. The Irish government argues that financial flows are regulated under EU directives. But these frameworks are woefully inadequate. They focus on transparency and minimal incentives for greener investments, not on curbing fossil fuel financing. Even those modest rules are now under threat, as the European Commission rolls back green finance and corporate sustainability initiatives, just as global fossil fuel use and emissions reach record highs. A woman is holding a placard Make Polluters Pay in front of SUV luxury car in London , UK. Alamy Stock Photo Alamy Stock Photo Far from transitioning, the fossil fuel industry is entrenching itself, and so are its investors. Our report reveals that BlackRock, which had over €18 billion in fossil fuel investments routed through Ireland in 2024, is also pulling back on previous sustainability pledges. There is no credible path to climate justice if financial flows to fossil fuels, including those channelled through Ireland, are not stopped. This means direct regulation of financial institutions, requiring them to adopt and implement transition plans aligned with the Paris Agreement. Ireland has both a responsibility and an opportunity to lead. By ending its role as an enabler of destructive fossil fuel investments and regulating investment through a lens of human rights and environmental due diligence, we can begin to put justice and sustainability at the centre of our financial system. Given its position as a hub for multinational financial institutions, we are calling on the Government to regulate the private financial sector to align with the goals of the Paris Agreement and end our outsized role as an enabler of fossil fuel investment. This includes prohibiting investments in projects that expand coal, oil, and gas production, as well as investments in the companies behind the expansion.

Such a law should include the regulation of investors with respect to human rights and the environment and climate. Globally, we should support the creation of a Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty to halt expansion and ensure a fair, funded global phase-out of fossil fuels. In addition, new taxes at both the EU and national levels can mobilise funds for climate justice, including wealth taxes, climate damage taxes on investors, and levies on aviation and shipping. And we can support debt cancellation and advocate for a UN framework for sovereign debt to give countries on the frontline of the climate crisis the breathing room to address the crisis. Planet earth with a conceptual arctic melting from global warming. Alamy Stock Photo Alamy Stock Photo Currently, the climate crisis is accelerating faster than political action to curb climate breakdown. Without urgent structural transformation, including a rapid global phase-out of fossil fuels, the world is on track for 2.6°C to 3.1°C of warming by 2100. Scientists have warned that this trajectory would be catastrophic, rendering vast regions uninhabitable. Ireland has the power to become a leader in climate justice. We can no longer afford to look away while billions flow through our financial system into the industries destroying our planet. It’s time to stop fuelling climate chaos and to start building a future that’s fair and sustainable for all. Caoimhe de Barra is CEO of Trócaire and Karol Balfe is CEO of ActionAid Ireland.

Title: More than €31bn in fossil fuel investments ‘based in Ireland’
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/04/30/over-31bn-in-fossil-fuel-investments-based-in-ireland-report-finds/
Time Published: 2025-04-30T05:00:00Z
Full Content:
Almost €32 billion in fossil fuel investment was held by Irish-based subsidiaries of finance companies last year, a new report claims. The sheer level of money involved ranks Ireland 14th in global terms and renders the State a “key global centre for investment”. The research report, The Hidden Truth: Ireland’s Role in the Global Fossil Fuel Industry, is published by Trócaire and ActionAid Ireland on Wednesday. The organisations are calling for direct regulation of financial institutions that would require them to adopt and implement transition plans aligned with the Paris Agreement on climate. “Ireland is facilitating the reckless pursuit of profit by financial institutions and corporations, which continue to pursue further expansion of oil and gas in spite of all the warnings and at the expense of the planet,” said Siobhán Curran, Trócaire’s head of policy and advocacy. “The carbon footprint of these financial flows is bigger than Ireland’s yearly emissions. This completely undermines efforts that are being taken to reduce emissions and ... means Ireland is playing an outsize role in fuelling the climate crisis.” ExxonMobil, which, according to the report, had €33.6 billion in profits in 2023, is singled out as the top fossil fuel investment held by asset managers based in Ireland. It also claims that, in 2023, such investments generated an estimated 72.5 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, more than the levels produced nationally. Tax and corporate regulation reforms at EU level are called for given that the regulation of the financial sector “remains weak and fragmented”. According to the authors, 91 per cent of investments made here were to companies that have plans for fossil fuel expansion. “Ireland may not have a domestic fossil fuel industry, but it is clear we are deeply complicit in fuelling the global climate emergency, providing a tax-friendly financial gateway for some of the most destructive industries on the planet,” said Karol Balfe, chief executive of ActionAid Ireland. The report states that, in monetary terms, as of June 2024, Irish-based subsidiaries of investment companies held €31.76 billion in bonds and shares issued by fossil fuel firms. “Ireland ranks 14th globally in terms of fossil fuel investment by manager location,” it notes. “Alongside Switzerland, Ireland is one of the only two jurisdictions with such significant fossil fuel investments without having a big fossil fuel industry of its own.” The largest volume of investments via Ireland includes US asset manager BlackRock with €18.9 billion, the report claims. US peer State Street was found to have €4.4 billion, and French banking conglomerate Crédit Agricole €2.1 billion. The report is critical of the State’s foreign direct investment policy which it identifies as a contributing factor in cultivating a financial landscape that facilitates capital movement.

Title: Bitcoin Vs. Ethereum: BlackRock CIO Ends The Debate
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-vs-ethereum-blackrock-cio/
Time Published: 2025-04-30T03:30:03Z
Full Content:
As BlackRock accelerates its expansion into digital assets in 2025, the divergence between Bitcoin and Ethereum in institutional adoption has become increasingly pronounced. In a interview on the Empire podcast, Samara Cohen, Senior Managing Director and Chief Investment Officer of ETF and Index Investments at BlackRock, offered a rare window into how the world’s largest asset manager views the two largest crypto assets — and why Bitcoin stands decisively ahead of Ethereum in client demand and portfolio integration. BlackRock’s historic launch of the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) marked a pivotal moment in the firm’s digital asset strategy. “It was all three of those things,” Cohen said, referring to the factors that drove the Bitcoin product launch. “But it really did start with the investment thesis and client demand to market structure and readiness to obviously the regulatory backdrop.” Cohen emphasized that before any regulatory greenlight, BlackRock’s decision was rooted in the strong desire from investors to access Bitcoin as part of diversified portfolios. The launch of IBIT was not BlackRock’s first move into Bitcoin. In 2022, the firm introduced a private Bitcoin trust for institutional clients, a critical internal milestone. “We didn’t get hands-on to actual Bitcoin until we launched that institutional product in 2022,” Cohen explained. “That was a very important institutional moment for us to just get comfortable with the workflows and the risk management and the systems.” The demand for Bitcoin was both broader and deeper than many had anticipated. IBIT has become the most successful ETP launch in history, a fact Cohen attributes in part to a previously untapped segment of investors. “Broadly speaking, about half of IBIT’s holders right now are what we call self-directed investors,” she noted. “For 3/4 of that population, they set up a brokerage account in some cases and bought their first ETP because they wanted their Bitcoin in the ETP wrapper.” This stands in sharp contrast to Ethereum, where Cohen’s tone was notably more cautious. While BlackRock has also launched Ethereum-based ETPs, demand has been far less robust. “Ethereum is still a distant second,” she said when discussing institutional investor interest. Unlike Bitcoin, which is increasingly viewed as a potential store of value and a diversifying asset class, Ethereum’s investment thesis has yet to solidify at the institutional level. Cohen elaborated on the complexity institutions face when evaluating Ethereum. “You might be really bullish on the utility of the public Ethereum blockchain but not know how that translates into value accrual to the native token,” she said. This uncertainty complicates the case for broad-based adoption. While Bitcoin’s narrative as a “borderless store of value” is relatively straightforward, Ethereum’s positioning remains more opaque, intertwining technological utility with questions about token economics, competition, and long-term market dynamics. Beyond the narrative gap, Cohen identified a more structural obstacle: crypto’s general lack of standardized data and metrics. “Crypto does broadly have a data and standards problem,” she stated. Drawing comparisons to traditional markets, Cohen emphasized that metrics like cash flow, governance, and team transparency — critical components for equity investing — are largely absent or inconsistent across most crypto assets. “If I think about indexing fundamentally as an organizing technology for a market, how do you perform that task in crypto right now?” she asked rhetorically, highlighting how foundational standards remain missing even in leading crypto ecosystems. Bitcoin’s adoption, by contrast, is supported by clearer metrics around its scarcity, issuance schedule, and market infrastructure maturity, making it easier to fit into traditional portfolio models. Cohen confirmed that BlackRock recommends a 1–2% Bitcoin allocation for investors seeking exposure, rooted in detailed analysis of risk contribution to portfolios. “If you go beyond 2%, the incremental contribution to overall portfolio volatility gets exponentially higher,” she warned. While Ethereum continues to make technological strides — particularly in decentralized finance and onchain applications — BlackRock’s view, at least for now, reflects the reality that institutions require clarity, standardization, and well-defined valuation models before committing meaningful capital. As Cohen summarized, “Understanding how to create a valuation framework for Ethereum or any other token gets more complicated.” At press time, BTC traded at $95,120.

Title: Ireland among top countries enabling investment in fossil fuels

Stock image. Photo: PA Irish branches of international financial institutions are facilitating billions of euro in investments in expanding fossil-­fuel operations around the world, new research shows. The analysis found the largely Dublin-­based operations held more than €31bn in oil, gas and other fossil-fuel investments last year. More than 90pc of those investments were in companies that are continuing or expanding oil and gas exploration. That is despite global pledges by governments to dramatically cut greenhouse gas emissions, for which fossil fuels are the primary source. The research was carried out for Trócaire and ActionAid Ireland, which are calling on the Government to stop private finance flowing through Ireland to fossil-fuel companies. Ireland enacted the Fossil Fuel Divestment Act in 2018 which pulled public money out of fossil fuels by prohibiting the state-owned Strategic Investment Fund from buying shares in them. However, the rules do not apply to private companies that either invest directly in fossil fuels or act on behalf of investors. Trócaire and ActionAid will meet politicians in Leinster House today to present their report and ask for amendments to the law. “The findings in this report are shocking,” ActionAid Ireland chief executive Karol Balfe said. “Ireland may not have a domestic fossil fuel industry, but it is clear we are deeply complicit in fuelling the global climate emergency, providing a tax-friendly ­financial gateway for some of the most destructive industries on the planet.” The report found that Ireland ranked 14th in the world in terms of managing international fossil-fuel investments. That puts Ireland ahead of much ­larger countries such as Russia, Kuwait and Brazil, which are major ­fossil-fuel ­producers. It calculated that the investments that flowed through Ireland in 2023 fuelled 72.5 million tonnes (mt) of carbon emissions – 10.5mt more than Ireland’s total national emissions for the year. Ms Balfe said none of this activity could be justified in countries that had signed up to the landmark Paris Agreement on cutting global emissions. “There is no credible path to climate safety if financial flows to fossil fuels, including those channelled through Ireland, are not shut down,” she said. “This means direct regulation of financial institutions, requiring them to adopt and implement transition plans aligned with the Paris Agreement.” Siobhán Curran, of Trócaire, said the aid agency was seeing first-hand the impacts of the continued support of the fossil-fuel industry in countries suffering severe droughts, floods, population displacement and other deadly effects of climate change. The Irish-based operations identified as holding the biggest investments in fossil fuels include BlackRock and State Street, both US-owned; Credit Agricole (France); Marsh McLennan (US); Intesa Sanpaolo (Italy); Banco Mediolanum (Italy); Power Corporation of Canada; Neuberger Berman (US); ­FinecoBank (Italy); and Zurich Insurance (Switzerland).

Title: The Next Wealth Revolution: How Circular Business Models Are Redefining Growth
URL: https://observer.com/2025/04/circular-economy-business-strategy/
Time Published: 2025-04-29T18:30:59Z
Full Content:
For much of the industrial era, the global economy has operated on a deceptively simple model: extract resources, produce goods and dispose of the rest. This linear system, known as “take-make-waste,” thrived under the illusion that resources were abundant, cheap and endlessly available. That era is over. The numbers are striking: global annual material consumption surpassed 100 billion tons in 2023, yet only 7.2 percent of that is cycled back into the economy. Municipal solid waste is projected to nearly double to 3.8 billion tons by 2050. This inefficiency isn’t just an environmental crisis; it’s a market failure. But within that failure lies a historic opportunity. Circular business models, which design out waste and keep materials in use, are emerging as the next great engine of value creation.

You can opt out anytime. Volatility in commodity markets is making it harder to rely on linear supply chains. Lithium prices, for example, rose by more than 1,000 percent between 2020 and late 2022, before dropping 86 percent as oversupply hit the market. That level of price fluctuation creates serious challenges for companies dependent on raw materials. It’s prompting a strategic rethink: increasingly, businesses are turning to circular solutions like integrating battery recycling directly into manufacturing operations. What was once viewed as waste is now considered a valuable, underutilized resource. In 2015, Accenture estimated that circular business models could generate up to $4.5 trillion in additional economic output by 2030. That forecast is proving increasingly realistic. Recycling aluminum, for example, requires 95 percent less energy than producing it from raw materials, and around 75 percent of all aluminum ever made is still in circulation. In manufacturing, remanufacturing components to original specifications can reduce production costs by 40 to 60 percent, lowering exposure to raw material volatility. The shift to circular models isn’t just about doing less harm—it’s unlocking real business potential. In consumer tech, Back Market has built one of the fastest-growing marketplaces for refurbished electronics, reaching a $5.7 billion valuation and reporting 45 percent revenue growth to €320 million ($363 million) in 2023. It’s now on track to profitability in Europe. In luxury fashion, Vestiaire Collective is proving that resale is far from niche, with €157 million ($178 million) in revenue and over €824 million ($936 million) in goods traded in 2023. Both are tapping into demand for high-quality, lower-impact alternatives—and showing how circular strategies can open new avenues for growth. The climate case for circularity is just as strong. According to Circle Economy’s 2024 report, nearly 40 percent of global emissions come from how we extract, use and dispose of materials. More than a supply chain issue, it’s a major driver of the climate crisis. Circular strategies, by keeping materials in use and cutting waste, can eliminate a significant share of those emissions. For companies looking to meet net-zero targets, circularity is fast becoming a core lever for decarbonization. Investors are increasingly recognizing the potential of the circular economy. In 2023, venture capital funding for circular economy startups reached approximately $8.7 billion. While this accounts for a small share of overall VC activity, the pace of growth signals rising interest in scalable, sustainability-driven innovation. Institutional investors are also entering the space; for instance, BlackRock (BLK) has launched a dedicated Global Circular Economy ETF to capitalize on this transition.​ Startup innovation is driving this momentum. U.S.-based Loop Industries is advancing depolymerization technology to recycle PET plastic at high quality, securing €20 million ($20.8 million) in December 2024 in strategic investment and licensing its technology in Europe. Similarly, Ecovative Design, a biomaterials company founded in 2007, has raised $155 million. Ecovative is commercializing mycelium-based alternatives to leather and packaging, demonstrating that bio-based circular materials can compete in food and fashion markets. All of this is further accelerated by geopolitics. The pandemic, war in Ukraine and surging trade tensions have exposed the fragility of global supply chains. Companies now recognize that resource resilience is a core business concern. Circular business models—such as localized remanufacturing, material recovery and reverse logistics—help reduce dependence on volatile imports and create more stable, regional value loops. In response, major players are acting. Apple (AAPL) has committed to using 100 percent recycled cobalt in batteries by 2025. IKEA is rolling out resale programs for furniture and investing in circular design. Michelin has shifted to a tire-as-a-service model for fleet clients—optimizing usage, extending product life and creating long-term customer relationships. Caterpillar’s remanufacturing division has proven that reusing components not only reduces waste, but also increases margin and customer retention. These examples aren’t exceptions, they’re early indicators of where the market is heading. They prove that the business case is no longer theoretical, and that the environmental impact case and business case can go hand in hand. Still, transitioning to circularity requires intent, strategic foresight and ultimately also investments. Crucially, it also calls for thinking and acting in ecosystems—where no company operates in isolation—and leveraging the power of evolving digital technologies to track, trace and optimize circular flows. It means rethinking product design, developing take-back systems, forming cross-industry collaborations and embedding lifecycle thinking into strategy. The payoff is compelling: lower risk, greater efficiency, stronger brand equity and real climate impact. For leaders, the question is not whether circularity matters, but whether your organization is ready to compete in a world that demands it. The companies that succeed in the next decade will create more value from fewer resources, deliver services over volume and turn yesterday’s waste into tomorrow’s growth. As we look ahead, it’s clear that the circular economy is a wealth creation engine. Those who innovate and invest now will define the next era of market leadership.

Title: Oxy Taps A.I. To Help Inject Old Oilfields With Carbon Dioxide
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherhelman/2025/04/29/oxy-taps-ai-to-help-inject-old-oilfields-with-carbon-dioxide/
Time Published: 2025-04-29T18:05:35Z
Full Content:
ByChristopher Helman ByChristopher Helman, Forbes Staff. Vicki Hollub ran operations in the Permian basin for Oxy before becoming CEO. She posed for Forbes in 2017. Occidental Petroleum’s conventional oilfields in the Permian basin of west Texas have been producing for decades. And although output has slowed, there remains 2 billion barrels of oil still trapped thousands of feet below the surface. Engineers have figured out several methods over the years to scour out stubborn oil from nooks and crannies in the reservoir rock (think of a sponge but with much tighter pore spaces). One involves strategically injecting water below the level of the oil in order to flush it out. After water, in some fields the engineers turn to injecting steam, which further softens up stubborn crude oil. For its old fields in the Permian, Oxy has big plans to deploy an even more effective solvent: carbon dioxide. Chief Executive Vicki Hollub — speaking last week at a conference organized by the Harold Hamm Institute for American Energy at Oklahoma State University in Oklahoma City — said that CO2 molecules have been proven to be considerably more effective than steam at scouring oil out of the rock. Especially compelling: the CO2 remains trapped in the rock, taking the place of the oil. Ironically, although carbon dioxide surrounds us, it’s hard to find it in concentrated form. Oxy for years has pumped CO2 out of the ground from naturally occurring reservoirs in Colorado and New Mexico, then sent it by pipeline to the Permian, where they then pressurize and inject the gas back down into old oilfields to goose out more crude. Recognizing that in the long run it’s probably better to leave the naturally occurring CO2 in the ground where they found it, Oxy a few years ago jumped on the concept of Direct Air Capture. After some $500 million invested (with BlackRock), this summer near Odessa, Texas, Oxy expects to start up its first plant to suck CO2 straight out of the air. Soon the company will sending this atmospheric greenhouse gas deep underground, both into oilfields as well as saline water reservoirs. Such techniques aren’t just nice to have, says Hollub, they are vital if the United States is to achieve and maintain anything close to the energy “dominance” promised by President Donald Trump. Without advanced recovery, said Hollub, Oxy won’t be able to tap 2 billion barrels of oil left in conventional fields in the Permian. America will need that oil. Hollub believes that the U.S. oil industry will hit peak production by the end of the decade. After that U.S. oil output will inexorably decline, she believes. Injecting CO2 into old oilfields could dramatically reduce that rate of decline. Hollub’s dream is ultimately to sequester more carbon into these layers of reservoir rock than is contained in the fossil fuels that Oxy produces from them — thereby enabling Oxy to market net-zero-carbon fuels. The first direct air capture plant under Oxy's Stratos project is nearing completion near Odessa. Oxy formed its carbon capture subsidiary 1Point5 and in 2023 acquired Canadian startup Carbon Engineering for its base tech, which uses potassium hydroxide to chemically react with CO2 and capture it from the air. Economically, Oxy happens to be the nation’s biggest maker of potassium hydroxide. This initial plant will make 250,000 tons per year of CO2, and Oxy is already leveraging iterative learnings to build a second plant for completion mid-2026. Engineers are using in-house artificial intelligence to build digital twins of these oilfields — feeding them millions of datapoints from thousands of sensors in order to design and simulate more effective strategies to help permanently inject the maximum amount of CO2 while extracting their more-sustainable petroleum. Hollub emphasized that this effort depends for its economic viability on the largesse of Uncle Sam. Federal law, as promulgated by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, currently provides for tax credits of as high as $180 per ton of CO2 recovered and sequestered underground. Current costs are higher than that. Frustrating (and inexplicable) for Hollub, the federal rules give maximum tax credits if the CO2 is permanently sequestered into non-oil saline reservoirs rather than used for enhanced oil recovery (whch gets $135 per ton). Hollub said that Oxy has already pre-sold carbon reduction credits tied to the project and hopes that, despite Trump administration promises to gut green subsidies, the Inflation Reduction Act’s so-called 45q provisions are kept in place. “It’s our one big ask” of the Trump Administration, said Hollub at the Hamm Institute conference: “Keep 45q in place for direct air capture. Make the credit equal to sequestration. Making net zero carbon oil is better than putting in a saline reservoirs. Getting penalized for not putting it in a saline is crazy.” The Trump administration has voiced its support for all manner of geologic sequestration. In early April Oxy and 1Point5 received its needed Class VI permits from the U.S. EPA to begin sequestering CO2 in a non-oilfield operation. EPA further announced this week that in Texas it would delegate future Class VI sequestration well permitting to state regulators. Once perfected, Oxy will look to license the technology to other industrial companies. Keeping an eye on developments is Warren Buffett. Berkshire Hathaway owns more than a third of Oxy via shares and preferred stock. Berkshire is also sitting on 84 million Oxy warrants with a strike price of $59.62. With Oxy shares at $40, Buffett’s investment is billions of dollars underwater. Buffett might like to bring down his cost basis. Berkshire, sitting on more than $300 billion in cash, could well afford to gobble up the rest of Oxy (p/e 12, market cap $40 billion). Buffett has sold down holdings of Apple and Bank of America and only just begun to redeploy, adding recently to Berkshire’s holdings in a handful of Japanese conglomerates such as Itochu, Sumitomo, Marubeni, Mitsui and Mitsubishi. Mitsui last year invested in an unrelated direct air capture pilot plant in Louisiana, while Mitsubishi and Itochu are investors in an Australian carbon-capture-cement startup. Who knows, with Buffett as salesman, he might soon be selling them Oxy’s air capture machines. Asked on the sidelines of the conference how she would feel about Berkshire and Buffett someday acquiring the rest of Oxy, Hollub replied, “It would be a dream come true.”

Sen. Cory Booker stumped for the Equality Act with Democrats on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, accusing President Donald Trump's administration of targeting transgender people. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., accused President Donald Trump's administration of targeting the transgender community on Tuesday, urging Congress to pass the Democrat-backed Equality Act. Booker made the emotional speech during an appearance on Capitol Hill alongside prominent Democrats from both the House and Senate. His speech, which lasted several minutes, borrowed heavily from the language of Martin Luther King, Jr. "The Equality Act is on the right side of history, and right now we stand in the cold shadow of injustice. And so here we are again, introducing this bill. But it is not a normal time that we introduce this bill. We introduced it in the backdrop of a president that in his very campaign, singled out an opportunistic bigotry. The trans community. We stand here in the backdrop of a time that LGBTQ Americans are being targeted and singled out for more injustice," Booker said. "I want you to know, we reintroduce this bill with attitude. We reintroduce this bill with swagger. We entered the bill Tuesday's bill with confidence, because there are a lot of people who are hearing our voice right now that don't understand that they are implicated. There's no bystanders in history. When injustice is in our midst, and you say nothing and you do nothing, you are part of the perpetuation of that injustice," he added. MULTIPLE FEDERAL AGENCIES END LINKEDIN CONTRACTS OVER DEI Sen. Cory Booker accused President Donald Trump's administration of "targeting" transgender people. (Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) "I remind those Americans, that even the truth, when crushed to the ground, after lie, after lie, after lie, that the truth will still rise again, that this is still one nation under God. That we still swear an oath of liberty and justice for all, and that we will not stop until freedom rings from every coast in this country. That freedom rings for every person and every soul. That freedom rings for every American, no matter who you are. Race, color or creed, LGBTQ, American or straight ally," he continued. "That we declare that the arc of the moral universe is long, but it doesn't bend automatically." TRUMP VOWS 'NEW ERA OF NATIONAL SUCCESS,' SAYS AMERICA'S 'DECLINE IS OVER' IN INAUGURAL ADDRESS "We declare today and every day until justice is established in this land, until the Equality Act passes, we declare that we, the people, will grab hold of that arc and pull and bend it until we live up to our promise in a country and truly are free at last, free at last," he finished.

Booker was joined by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., as well as former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., among other lawmakers. MAJOR UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER ACCUSED OF HIDING DEI PROGRAMS, INFLUENTIAL SENATOR CALLS THEM OUT The legislative push comes as Trump's administration has pushed to end unpopular diversity, equity and inclusion programs throughout the federal government. The president’s efforts to end DEI across the federal government also prompted the cancellation of such programs across the private sector. Meta, in January, canceled its DEI programs, as did McDonald's. And after the 2024 election, Walmart, Ford Motor Co., John Deere, Lowe's and Toyota also ended DEI programs. President Donald Trump has pushed to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion programs across the federal government. (AP/Alex Brandon) As recently as April, according to Forbes, IBM, Gannett, and Constellation Brands Inc., made changes to DEI policies. Earlier in 2025, UnitedHealth Group, MLB, Victoria’s Secret, Warner Bros. Discovery, Goldman Sachs, Paramount, Bank of America, BlackRock, Citigroup, Pepsi, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Coca-Cola, Deloitte, PBS, Google, Disney, GE, PayPal, Chipotle and more scaled back or canceled their DEI programs.

Title: Trump buries Biden foreign policy in first 100 days

Time Published: 2025-04-29T17:00:01Z
Full Content:
Middle East Forum Executive Director Gregg Roman described President Donald Trump’s foreign policy approach as one that makes those who harm American interests "pay." One hundred days into his new administration, President Donald Trump has reset negotiations with allies and foes across the globe, and experts say one is certain: it is all transactional. Gone are the days when the U.S. could be drawn to throw its force around the world solely in the name of defending or spreading democracy. Global leaders are learning to speak a new language with U.S. leadership, one that is less about ideology and more about how their interests benefit U.S. interests. "There is a lot more transactional engagement rather than I think we're ideological-based, policy decisions that were sort of the hallmark of the Biden administration," said Gregg Roman, executive director of the Middle East Forum. Here is a round-up of how Trump has changed U.S. foreign policy since taking office: FOX NEWS POLL: THE FIRST 100 DAYS OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S SECOND TERM Iran's supreme leader Ali Khamenei, left, and President Donald Trump are working on a nuclear deal. (West Asia News Agency, Reuters | SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images) Former President Joe Biden toyed with reviving a nuclear deal with Iran and criticized Trump’s decision to pull the U.S. out of the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, but his administration made little progress toward serious negotiations. Trump has now expressed interest in a new nuclear deal. He told Israel the U.S. would not come to their aid in attacking Iran until diplomatic negotiations played out. As Trump’s team met with Iranian counterparts in Oman this weekend for a second round of nuclear talks, he issued another threat: if negotiations whither away, the U.S. would not be dragged by Israel into war with Iran but will be "leading the pack." An offensive campaign against Yemen’s Houthi terrorists launched six weeks ago has struck more than 800 targets and cost nearly $1 billion – a sharp departure from the tit-for-tat retaliatory strikes seen under the Biden administration, when Houthis attacked U.S. naval ships and Western commercial vessels. "Biden pursued a policy of retaliatory strikes: If you hit us, we'll hit you," said Roman. "What Trump is trying to do is what I call a salting the earth strategy. If you dare challenge American military supremacy or the ability for us to conduct free trade to the bottom of or through the Gulf of Aden, Gulf of Yemen, Red Sea, Suez … We will attempt to end your ability to wage war on the United States in its interests." US STRIKES KILL HUNDREDS OF HOUTHI FIGHTERS, HIT OVER 800 RED SEA TARGETS: CENTRAL COMMAND President Donald Trump is taking a different approach when dealing with Houthi fighters. (AP Images/Getty Images) While Biden had promised the U.S. would stand by Ukraine "as long as it takes" in the war against Russia, Trump expressed a desire to see the war come to an end, promising that he could end the war on "day one" of his presidency. One hundred days in, the war is not over. Negotiations are ongoing, and Trump has jumped between sounding off in frustration with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin. As Putin continues to strike even civilian regions of Ukraine, Trump questioned on Saturday whether the Russian leader truly wants peace or is "tapping me along." He again questioned whether he would need to slap "secondary sanctions" on nations that do business with Russia to starve its war coffers. On Monday, Russia offered a three-day ceasefire from May 8-10, but the White House was not satisfied. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump wants a "permanent ceasefire." Trump met face-to-face with Zelenskyy in Rome on Saturday, the first time since their infamous Oval Office spat in February, after slamming Zelenskyy’s latest rejection of his peace proposal, one that would have formally ceded Crimea to the Russians. President Donald Trump, left, met face-to-face with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for the first time since their Oval Office spat in February over the weekend. (Vatican and Ukraine Ambassador to Holy See) The Monroe Doctrine is back, analysts say, and Trump wants both Greenland and the Panama Canal under U.S. control. The proposals drew shock across the world, but at least in Panama, Trump’s bold words prompted a proposal to offer the U.S. "first and free" passage for its warships, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said earlier this month. It also spurred the proposed sale of two ports of entry from Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison to U.S.-based BlackRock, though that deal has been delayed by Chinese regulatory and political scrutiny. Efforts to attain Greenland have proved less successful. Tough talk against Denmark and its ownership of Greenland has ratcheted up tensions with the NATO ally and Greenland’s leadership has expressed little interest in becoming a part of the U.S. However, Trump has called out the threat of Russia and China’s increasing arctic military capabilities – the shortest range for a missile to travel from Russia to the U.S. would be over the icy island’s territory. Trump is also interested in the rare earth mining potential of the massive swath of land. President Donald Trump wants the U.S. to control the Panama Canal. (REUTERS/Enea Lebrun/File Photo) Trump’s threats to pull out of the NATO alliance – or refuse to come to the defense of allies that do not contribute enough military spending – has left nations across the world planning for the contingency that they may have to defend themselves without U.S. aid. The European Union announced a plan for its nations to spend $840 billion to "re-arm Europe" after Trump halted all aid to Ukraine in March. Countries like Spain, Belgium and Sweden have all announced plans this year to increase defense spending to meet NATO’s 2% target, while eastern European states near Russia’s border, including Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and Poland, have announced plans to increase defense spending to around 5%. Concern over China’s hegemonic ambitions bridges the partisan divide, but the Biden White House never considered such drastic measures as 145% tariffs. Trump has said the goal of the tariffs is to both bring back US manufacturing after decades of offshore production and punish China for intellectual property theft, a massive trade imbalance, and fentanyl flowing from China to the U.S. A free trade push in the early 2000s had wrongly assumed liberal trade policies would bring democratic values and free markets into Chinese borders, his supporters argue. Trump has insisted that President Xi Jinping wants to cut a deal to lower the soaring tariffs, even as China has rejected the prospect of talks. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP It is unclear what sort of realistic concessions the U.S. could get out of a deal, perhaps promises to buy more American-made agricultural products, fuel or other specialty goods. For now, steep tariffs remain, and China is choking off U.S. supply of critical minerals, which could spell deep trouble for everyday electronics, electric vehicles and defense equipment.

Influence also has invested in the rights to Khaled’s music catalog, including recorded-music and publishing, which will grow to 14 studio albums with the release of his next project. Related Stories VIP+ How the ‘Sinners’ Financing Model Offers Salvation for All Producers Pedro Almodóvar Slams Trump in Fiery Speech at Lincoln Center Honors: 'You Will Go Down in History as a Catastrophe' Sources tell Variety the deal is in the low nine-figure range. Popular on Variety Khaled’s long list of musical collaborators includes Jay-Z, Beyonce, Justin Bieber, Drake, Quavo, Chance the Rapper, Lil Wayne and many others. Terms of the deal were not disclosed further; several film projects are currently in various stages of development as a result of the alliance, according to the announcement. Founded in 2019, Influence Media’s investment strategy is built on “modern evergreens,” songs, and diverse artists with a strong potential for long-term impact on pop culture. The latest round of capital also follows the launch of Influence’s independent record label, music publishing and distribution company, Slang, which signed Will Smith last year. Backed by BlackRock and Warner Music Group, Influence’s latest fund has secured more than 30 music-rights investments, also including Enrique Iglesias, Blake Shelton, Jessie Reyez, songwriter-producer Julia Michaels, and others; in January it secured $360 million in debt financing. Khaled said, “I’m proud that my legacy will continue to resonate and connect with audiences around the world with this partnership through Influence Media. These iconic recordings I’ve created will continue to be curated in the most optimum manner to impact culture with nearly two decades of music. In addition, I’m excited for the world to see and experience the film and television projects Influence and We The Best are developing and producing together. This next phase of my career will be filled with ground-breaking cultural impact, and I look forward to being at the forefront in all categories.” “Influence Media was founded on the principle that music can move culture, and few entertainers embody this more than DJ Khaled,” said Lylette Pizarro, Influence Media Founder and Co-Managing Partner. “Our joint venture NIL deal, and extended catalog partnership is an alliance that will create boundless opportunities for this creative genius, and will also further establish that DJ Khaled is a rare talent whose abilities extend far beyond the traditional confines of music. His enormous creativity, heart, and drive are matched only by his savvy business instincts and that is why the possibilities of what we can build together in this collaboration are immeasurable.” “DJ Khaled has had so many iconic eras in his career to date, and we couldn’t be more excited to build ‘another one’ through this first-of-its-kind partnership,” says Rene McLean, Influence Media Partner and CEO of Slang. “Much in the same way that all the top artists consider a DJ Khaled collab a major career milestone, we think of this as a huge step forward for Slang.” A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment

After a two-month-long downfall, which saw the total market cap of the top meme coins fall from $116.6B to just $40B, the meme coin market is up and running again. It has gained a staggering 45% in market cap in around three weeks. Moreover, last week, Bitcoin ETFs experienced their largest inflows ($3B) since December. Plus, according to a recent forecast by financial services company Standard Chartered, we could see $BTC touching $120K by Q2 2025. Seeing as it’s only the beginning of what could be a long rally, now’s the best time to beef up your crypto portfolio with some trendy altcoins. To help you out, we’ve handpicked the best crypto to buy now. There’s really no denying that Donald Trump has taken crypto to new heights. For instance, the massive rally in November was on the back of the promises he made in his presidential campaign to make the US more crypto-friendly. Trump indeed delivered on his promises, as we’re now seeing an unprecedented increase in government-level Bitcoin reserves worldwide. Large institutions like Strategy and BlackRock are also buying $BTC left, right, and center. So, it’s only fair that Donald Trump’s very own meme coin, $TRUMP, is strongly placed in the list of the top trending cryptos. $TRUMP has jumped over 50% in the last seven days, and more than 32% in the last month or so. It’s worth noting, however, that $TRUMP is still nowhere close to its full potential. Remember, it reached around $72 when it launched in late January. Another reason to be optimistic about $TRUMP’s future is the president’s direct interest in the project’s prosperity. For instance, he recently announced that the top 220 $TRUMP holders will be invited to dinner with him. It’s worth remembering that an enthusiastic meme coin market is often the result of the king cryptocurrency, i.e., Bitcoin, soaring to new heights. If you want to make the most of Bitcoin’s rise specifically, consider investing in BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL), the best Bitcoin-themed crypto on the market right now. While other coins offer more of their own tokens for free as part of their airdrops, $BTCBULL stands out by offering free (and real) $BTC in its airdrops. This is also how it has tied itself to Bitcoin’s success story. BTC Bull Token’s airdrops will take place every time $BTC crosses a new milestone, such as $150K, $200K, and $250K. Keep in mind that you’ll only be eligible for your share of free Bitcoins if you store your $BTCBULL tokens in Best Wallet. What’s more, the developers have also planned to follow a steady burn mechanism, which involves reducing the token’s total supply bit by bit at regular intervals. This is done to boost the token’s demand, trading volume, and ultimately its price. You can join the ‘Bull Army’ by joining the $BTCBULL presale for just $0.002485 per token. The project has raised over $5.1M so far. Want in? Here’s a full guide on how to buy $BTCBULL. Jelly-My-Jelly is a meme coin on the Solana network created by Iqram Magdon-Ismail, the co-founder of Venmo, and Sam Lessin, a crypto investor. On paper, $JEELYJELLY has been touted as the crypto that grants holders early-bird access to the upcoming Jelly Jelly video-sharing app. The app will reportedly offer the fastest way to post bite-sized clips, known as ‘Jellies,’ from a video chat. However, the token’s current bull run is driven by community backing rather than anything else. Jelly-My-Jelly’s recent performance has been just as delicious as its name. It has rocketed 200% in the last seven days – from around $0.012 to $0.033. It’s currently flirting with its major resistance level of $0.40, the break of which could see it shoot to new highs and result in even more mind-boggling gains. Solaxy ($SOLX) is unlike most other meme coins mentioned on this list. That’s because it’s a token with real utility and real-world application. Solaxy will build the first-ever Layer 2 scaling solution on Solana, which has been plagued with congestion and scalability issues ever since the launch of $TRUMP and $MELANIA on it. Meme coin developers prefer Solana because of its high speed and low fees. However, because the network is now experiencing an overload of meme coin traders and investors, it’s no longer as smooth a blockchain as it once was. Solaxy will solve this by processing a bunch of Solana’s transactions on a sidechain. By redirecting transaction requests away from the network’s mainnet, Solaxy will reduce the burden on Solana and restore its speed of executing transactions. Additionally, Solaxy will club several transaction requests and process them together, thereby reducing transaction costs and improving Solana’s affordability. For more info, check out our guide on how to buy Solaxy. ai16z is the first-ever decentralized venture capital firm to use the inputs of AI agents for its decision-making. This unique AI-powered trading fund is based on the Solana blockchain. Unlike traditional venture capital firms that need a lot of time and manpower for research before investing, ai16z will bank on cutting-edge AI agents to collect and analyze data, including market sentiments. $AI16Z is already up 97% in the last seven days, but it has only just broken out of a descending resistance line. This means that there could be more gains in store, including a potential run to the $0.60 level, which would result in a nearly 200% upmove from its current price of $0.3021. Even though the current sentiment among crypto investors is positive, it’s worth remembering that crypto is one market where things, especially future outlooks, can change quickly. With that in mind, you must always invest cautiously, which includes only throwing in an amount you’re comfortable losing. Finally, kindly do your own research before investing.

Title: The Quiet Revolution In Asset Markets And Tokenization

BySean Lee BySean Lee, Contributor. Tokenization and the Financial System Forum during the World Bank/IMF Spring Meetings at the ... More International Monetary Fund (IMF) headquarters in Washington, Wednesday, April 23, 2025. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana) When Mantra’s $OM token crashed in the start of April, crypto skeptics had their moment. Another real-world assets (RWAs) blockchain project bites the dust, they said. Traditional finance would surely retreat from tokenization experiments. The crash wiped out millions in value overnight, adding to the long list of crypto’s cautionary tales. Then, something strange happened. The money kept flowing in, but not to speculative tokens. Instead, it flowed to RWAs on the blockchain. BlackRock continued building. Franklin Templeton doubled down. By April, total value locked (TVL) in tokenized assets crossed the $20 billion mark. While experts speculated the Mantra collapse would scare institutions away, it showed them exactly what not to do. Asset managers discovered something valuable in blockchain’s infrastructure. They began moving Treasury bills, rental income, and private credit onto chains. Global markets used to run on these fundamental assets. And now they run faster. Institutional adoption brings new demands for blockchain infrastructure. Zero Hash exemplifies this shift, processing over $2 billion in tokenized fund flows across 22 blockchains in just four months. Their rails now support seven different stablecoins, powering settlements for giants like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton. Regulatory compliance drives innovation, too. Chintai secured licenses from Singapore’s MAS for compliant issuance and trading. Their Nexus platform now handles $675 million in tokenized value, with ambitious plans to reach $10 billion this year. The focus on regulation attracts serious institutional capital — their recent partnerships with RealNOI bringing $570 million in rental income on-chain and Kin Capital’s tokenized $100M real estate debt fund are just a few examples. It’s these infrastructure providers that lay the groundwork for specialized innovation. Money market funds move trillions of dollars daily through global markets. These funds form the backbone of institutional cash management, yet they still settle through systems designed decades ago. Franklin Templeton saw an opportunity to change this. Jiritsu’s $JUSD stablecoin launch on BNB Chain started modestly — just $1 million in TVL — but brought something new to market. Their MintBurn system provides real-time proof of reserves, letting users verify their backing at any moment. The stablecoin draws its stability from Franklin Templeton’s BENJI U.S. Money Market Fund, creating a bridge between traditional finance and blockchain efficiency. Traditional stablecoins rely on monthly attestations, while Jiritsu’s system updates these proofs continuously. Users see exactly what backs their assets and when those assets move. No more waiting for monthly reports or trusting third-party auditors. The project’s second phase aims beyond simple scaling. Its permissionless framework could allow any regulated fund to bring assets on-chain using the same infrastructure. For instance, money market funds represent a $7 trillion market globally. Just moving even a fraction of that onto blockchain infrastructure could reshape institutional cash management. While it’s true that tokenized assets require lots of infrastructure, they also need liquidity. Major market makers spotted this opportunity early. Jane Street began providing liquidity for BlackRock’s tokenized funds in February. Citadel Securities launched a dedicated digital asset desk focusing exclusively on regulated, tokenized securities. That means traditional finance wants to shape how these assets trade. And the performance data backs their interest. RWA tokens weathered recent market volatility better than their purely crypto counterparts. CHEX, powering Chintai’s regulated platform, maintained stability during the March downturn. The token’s value reflects growing institutional confidence in regulated tokenization platforms. Innovation spreads beyond conventional financial instruments. RealNOI and Kin Capital’s partnerships with Chintai demonstrates the potential for alternative income streams. Their platform tokenizes rental income from 1,900 apartments, offering investors exposure to real estate cash flows without the burden of property management. Projected annual returns above 5% attracted both crypto natives and traditional real estate investors. Other experiments push boundaries further. Republic’s private credit platform brought traditionally illiquid loans on-chain. Zero Hash expanded beyond simple settlement, building specialized rails for dividend distributions and corporate actions. Each successful implementation creates a template for other institutions to follow. The Mantra collapse shook market confidence in March. Excessive leverage had amplified volatility, triggering a wave of liquidations across the platform. Beyond immediate losses, the incident forced hard questions about risk management in RWA protocols. Market data reveals broader sector resilience. Through April, Maple Finance saw institutional deposits climb steadily. Their focus remained simple: conservative lending backed by verified assets. Circle’s USDC expanded into settlement layers for tokenized securities. Even BlackRock pushed forward with their BUIDL initiative, treating Mantra’s troubles as an isolated case. This resilience stems from fundamental differences in RWA tokens. Real assets generate actual cash flows. Treasury yields arrive on schedule. Rental income flows monthly. These are productive assets made more efficient through tokenization, and that’s why big institutions continue to back them. Regulatory frameworks for tokenized assets evolve unevenly across markets. Singapore’s MAS cleared the path with precise guidelines. Hong Kong welcomed tokenized funds with open arms. The U.S. SEC moves cautiously but steadily, evaluating each regulated tokenization proposal. Technical innovation has evolved hand-in-hand with regulatory progress, transforming compliance processes into automated systems. Verification systems deliver transparency without compromising security. These advances streamline institutional participation while maintaining regulatory standards. The impact of these changes becomes clearer each month. Traditional finance and blockchain efficiency draw closer each month. Banks reimagine settlement through tokenization. Asset managers experiment with programmable securities. Trading desks adapt to handle digital assets. Every step forward cements RWAs as crucial components of tomorrow’s financial infrastructure.

Title: Full Speed Ahead: It’s Been a Fast-Paced Year for Nonbanks

© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy While the rise of alternative lenders and debt funds has created buzz around a relatively new side of finance, the industry of private credit really came into its own over the last 12 months. And its activities can be seen all over the Power Finance list. As billions of dollars of commercial real estate assets struggled to be refinanced at maturity, and dozens of construction projects cried out for bridge and senior financing to either get off the ground or sprint across the finish line, private credit emerged in 2024 as a flexible, and dependable, source of capital. “It’s been an incredible positive for the industry, and the amount of liquidity that’s come in, on the credit side, is staggering, and it’s clearly coming from the debt funds,” said Tom Traynor, vice chairman and co-head of large loans at CBRE (CBRE). The numbers don’t lie. Between 2013 and 2023, U.S. private credit — corporate and real estate loans originated by private, nonbank lenders — grew from $141 billion to $853 billion, according to the financial data provider Preqin. The number now stands at $1.7 trillion, and BlackRock predicts that the global private credit market will double over the next five years and reach $3.5 trillion by 2030. Private credit used to be limited to a few, select opportunity funds financing mezzanine pieces, but today this industry finances the full spectrum of commercial real estate assets and deals in highly complex loan packages. Moreover, alternative lenders believe they can offer their borrowers services that banks either can’t do or won’t provide, particularly speed of execution and the ability to take over stalled projects and foreclosures due to their vertically integrated structure. “There’s a whole slew of borrowers for whom bank financing just doesn’t make sense. There’s not enough proceeds, and they can’t go high enough in leverage,” explained Marcello Cricco-Lizza, principal of global commercial real estate at Balbec Capital. “Whereas, we can add higher leverage on our loans, and have the sophistication to take over those properties and work them out that banks don’t have.” And, while commercial banks still dominate the global credit space, many traditional lenders have decided it’s wiser to join up with the debt funds rather than to simply fight them for clients. This has created an entire industry of “lender financing,” where banks lend to debt funds to get their hands on the biggest CRE deals out there. Through warehouse-type facilities and repurchase structures (repos) — which include note-on-note finances, joint venture uni-trench loans, and single-asset repos — the banks have been able to originate safer CRE loans that receive better capital treatment and that place balance sheet risk in the hands of safer sponsors. Scott Rechler, chairman of RXR, argued that banks like to be lenders to nonbanks due to the favorable credit treatment and the better collateral, as well as the fact that whole loans provided to the funds are often broken up to disentangle risk — which is also easier for borrowers to live with. “What we’re finding is an interesting simpatico, where everyone is finding their home and it works for all pieces,” said Rechler.

Title: Three Zones Of Safety For Investors In Uncertain Times

ByRob Kaplan ByRob Kaplan, Contributor. Demonstrators hold a banner reading "Climate Justice" during a mass climate march to demand urgent ... More action on the climate crisis from world leaders attending the COP25 summit, in Madrid, on December 6, 2019. - The main march takes place in Madrid on the sidelines of the UN climate conference, with a simultaneous rally in the Chilean capital, which had been due to host the 12-day gathering but was forced to pull out due to deadly anti-government protests. (Photo by GABRIEL BOUYS / AFP) (Photo by GABRIEL BOUYS/AFP via Getty Images) Could now be a moment of opportunity for investors looking to make money and a positive impact? That idea may sound nutty amid unprecedented uncertainty and a dramatic rise in anti-environment rhetoric and actions in the macro environment. If you’re spooked by the headlines, you’re not alone. But once you cut through the noise, opportunities reveal themselves and the reality starts to look a bit different. While the language around climate commitments may be shifting, many of the most influential players, from institutional investors to global corporates, are continuing undeterred. The commitments remain. The capital is still flowing. And for investors willing to look beyond the political theater, there is absolutely a way forward — possibly an even more lucrative one. Yes, uncertainty is in the air. But here are three zones of safety I believe can weather the pushback and continue to deliver strong returns in the sustainability space. 1. Sustainability agendas are global and will continue to drive investment opportunities. Asia is a case in point. It’s not all about the United States. While climate and DEI are being leveraged for political points in the West, the demand for solutions to our greatest social and environmental challenges continues to grow. And here, the rest of the world has an opportunity to step up and fill in the gap. Asia is a case in point. As we look forward, GDP in Asia is outpacing the rest of the world. Vietnam (6%), Indonesia (5.2%), and India (7%) are projected to be among the world’s fastest-growing economies in 2025, according to the IMF. Unlike stagnating developed markets, the region provides a clearer long-term growth trajectory, supported by rising consumer demand, a burgeoning middle class, and sustained infrastructure investment. This growth has drawn increasing attention from global investors. In January 2025, responsAbility Investments secured over $350 million for its Asia Climate Strategy, with more than half coming from private sector investors. Just earlier this month, ABC Impact, a Singapore-based private equity firm focused on Asia, closed its second fund at over $600 million, with clean energy and climate resilience among its core focus areas. Climate-focused funds in the region are gaining traction, underscoring the appetite for both impact and market-rate returns. At the same time, many investors are starting to question preconceived notions about the risks of emerging markets. In today’s environment, the traditional view that developed markets are inherently “safer” no longer holds. Achieving strong returns in the U.S. and Europe increasingly means navigating high corporate debt levels, currently around 80% of GDP in the U.S., slower economic growth, and policy uncertainty. By contrast, high-growth markets in Asia offer not only stronger fundamentals, but also greater resilience. That’s why more investors are turning to the Asian market: not just for upside potential, but as part of a more balanced and forward-looking risk management strategy. A recent study by the GIIN on the state of impact investing in Asia found that there is a growing opportunity for impact investors to use private capital to support these economies. To be clear, these are market-rate investments that should be of particular interest to Asia-focused investors, 76% of whom are focused on risk-adjusted, market-return investments. Look at companies like Renew Power in India, which has grown from a small startup into one of the country’s largest renewable energy companies with over 12 GW of operational capacity and backing from global investors like Goldman Sachs. Or consider Indonesia’s GoTo, which is rapidly transitioning its massive ride-hailing fleet to electric vehicles while building the charging infrastructure to support it. Thailand’s Energy Absolute has evolved from a biodiesel producer into a vertically integrated clean energy powerhouse spanning solar farms, EV manufacturing, and battery production. These aren't charity cases — they're market-driven opportunities that happen to be solving critical sustainability challenges. 2. The climate transition can’t be rolled back, but the reputational calculus has changed Climate investing is here to stay. Yes, U.S.-based asset managers (hello, BlackRock) may be getting cold feet, and even in Europe, there are signs they may consider watering down some of their sustainability requirements for corporations working in the Eurozone. But everyone should take a deep breath. The pushback is already getting pushback. The FT has already reported that large U.K.-based pension funds are sticking to their climate commitments and challenging asset managers who are walking back their climate commitments. That’s significant. These pensions are ultimately accountable to their constituents, and funds like Brunel Pension and Nest are making it clear: climate alignment still matters, and they expect their managers to course-correct. Similarly, TPG’s Tim Coulter recently went on record that his firm is bullish on impact and expected them to ramp up their fundraising for climate-related strategies. When one of private equity's most successful investors sees opportunity in climate, it's worth paying attention. Perhaps more importantly, while public equity sustainability strategies faced outflows in the first quarter, the private markets are telling a different story. Capital is coming back into key areas of the sustainability space, especially through venture and private equity. PitchBook data shows that VC and PE firms poured more than $5 billion into climate-tech startups across the US in the first quarter, up 65% from the previous year. As for multinational corporates, many are discovering that aspirational climate talk no longer earns reputational points, not if it’s not backed up by meaningful action. The reputational value of saying the right thing has flipped; the cost of failing to deliver is now higher than the benefit of making bold but unsubstantiated promises. Just look at BlackRock: Larry Fink’s climate positioning earned the firm goodwill, until it became clear that those values weren’t fully embedded in strategy. That made it all too easy to walk them back when the political winds shifted. When it comes to multinational corporates, they have global commitments that are going to be hard to pare back. They do, after all, need to factor in climate risk to their business strategies. In fact, leaders coming out of Davos in January expressed conviction that many global corporates are sticking to their knitting when it comes to their net-zero and other climate commitments. What we’ll see next isn’t more big climate pledges. It’s deeper integration of climate strategies into business models, and a stronger focus on tangible results. That’s where capital will go, and where value will be created. 3. Opportunities to invest in the circular economy and materials transition will continue to ramp up. The transition toward circular economy business models represents one of the most undervalued investment opportunities in the sustainability space, particularly in emerging markets where growth equity can capture outsized returns. Why? Because future growth rates for critical materials are expected to significantly outpace historical patterns across all demand scenarios, especially in absolute terms. This demand is fueled by an increasingly complex global trade picture, thanks to trade wars and tariffs, pushing domestic and local / regional trade to the fore. There’s a massive gap between corporate commitments and the actual availability of circular solutions across multiple material streams. This disconnect is global but especially pronounced in high-growth markets where recycling value chains remain highly fragmented — a perfect opportunity for investors who understand both sustainability and supply chain dynamics. Take packaging as just one example. Demand for plastic packaging continues climbing steadily, driven partly by a preference for plastics' short use-cycle and pervasive nature. This demand is fueling the need for more sustainable packaging solutions as efforts to increase circular plastic systems and develop effective recycling systems continue to grow. But similar opportunities exist across textiles, construction materials, e-waste, and other consumer goods. With circular business models still in their infancy across most sectors, investors have a singular opportunity to get in on the ground floor. Companies that can establish early leadership in creating high-quality recycled materials at scale will likely become acquisition targets for major packaging companies desperate to drive resiliency in their supply chains. Political winds will always shift, but the fundamental drivers of sustainability investments — resource scarcity, climate risk, consumer demand, and corporate commitments — aren't going away. Smart investors are looking beyond the headlines to identify opportunities where these forces create market inefficiencies they can capitalize on. The three zones I’ve outlined — global sustainability investments (particularly in Asia), climate transition commitments from institutional investors and corporates, and the materials transition — represent areas where capital can find both impact and returns regardless of political rhetoric. For investors willing to take a slightly contrarian stance in today’s environment, these zones of safety might not just offer protection — they could provide some of the most compelling risk-adjusted returns of the decade. Sometimes the best investments are made when others are running scared.

Title: A Vanishing $212M Bitcoin Order Caused Chaos for Traders. Is Spoofing Back in Crypto?
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/04/29/a-vanishing-usd212m-bitcoin-order-caused-chaos-for-traders-is-spoofing-back-in-crypto
Time Published: 2025-04-29T13:06:04Z
Full Content:
On April 14, someone put in a sell order for 2,500 bitcoin, worth roughly $212 million, on the Binance order book at $85,600, around 2-3% above the spot prices trading at the time. Seeing such a large order, the bitcoin price started to gravitate to this level at around 17:00 UTC. Suddenly, the order was gone, as seen using Coin Glass data, which caused a brief moment of market apathy as bulls and bears tussled to fill a void in liquidity. The bitcoin price at the time, however, was already on shaky ground due to geopolitical concerns. Subsequently, it went lower after the vanishing order caused chaos for the traders. So what happened? One answer could be an illegal technique that involves placing a large limit order to rile trading activity and then removing the order once the price comes close to filling it. This is called "order spoofing," defined by the 2010 U.S. Dodd-Frank Act as "the illegal practice of bidding or offering with the intent to cancel before execution." As seen in the liquidity heatmap in the image above, on the surface, the order with a price of $85,600 seemed like a key area of resistance, which is why market prices started to gravitate towards it. However, in reality, that order and liquidity were likely spoofed, giving traders the illusion of a stronger market. Liquidity heatmaps visualize an order book on an exchange and show how much of an asset rests on the book at each price point. Traders will use a heatmap to identify areas of support and resistance or even to target and squeeze under-pressure positions. In this particular case, the trader seemed to have placed a possible spoof order when the U.S. equity market was closed, usually a time period of low liquidity for the 24/7 bitcoin market. The order was then removed when the U.S. market opened as the price moved towards filling it. This could still have had the desired effect, as, for instance, a large order on one exchange might spur traders or algorithms on another exchange to remove their order, creating a void in liquidity and subsequent volatility. Another reason could be that the trader placing a $212 million sell order on Binance wanted to create short-term sell pressure to get filled on limit buys, and then they removed that order once those buys were filled. Both options are plausible, albeit still illegal. Former ECB analyst and current managing director of Oak Security, Dr. Jan Philipp, told CoinDesk that manipulative trading behavior is a "systemic vulnerability, especially in thin, unregulated markets." "These tactics give sophisticated actors a consistent edge over retail traders. And unlike TradFi, where spoofing is explicitly illegal and monitored, crypto exists in a gray zone." He added that "spoofing needs to be taken seriously as a threat as it helped trigger the 2010 Flash Crash in traditional markets, which erased almost $1 trillion in market value." Binance, meanwhile, insists that it is playing its part in preventing market manipulation. "Maintaining a fair and orderly trading environment is our top priority and we invest in internal and external surveillance tools that continuously monitor trading in real-time, flagging inconsistencies or patterns that deviate from normal market behavior," a Binance spokesperson told CoinDesk, without directly addressing the case of the vanishing $212 million order. The spokesperson added that if anyone is found manipulating markets, it will freeze accounts, report suspicious activity to regulators, or remove bad actors from its platform. Spoofing, or a strategy that mimics a fake order, is illegal, but for a young industry such as crypto, history is rife with such examples. During 2014, when there was little to no regulatory oversight, the majority of trading volume took place on bitcoin-only exchanges from retail traders and cypherpunks, opening the industry to such practices. During 2017's ICO phase, when trading volume skyrocketed, tactics such as spoofing were also expected, as institutions were still skeptical about the asset class. In 2017 and 2018, traders regularly placed nine-figure positions that they had no intention of filling, only to pull the order shortly after. BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes said in a 2017 blog post that he "found it incredible" that spoofing was illegal. He argued that if a smart trader wanted to buy $1 billion of BTC, they would bluff a $1 billion sell order to get it filled. However, since the 2021 bull market, the crypto market has experienced waves of institutional adoption, such as Coinbase (COIN) going public, Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) going all-in on bitcoin, and BlackRock launching exchange-traded funds (ETFs). At the time of writing, there are no such large orders that indicate further spoofing attempts, and spoofing attempts have seemed to have become less blatant. However, even with billions traded by TradFi firms, examples of such a strategy still exist across many crypto exchanges, particularly on low-liquidity altcoins. For example, last month, cryptocurrency exchange MEXC announced that it had reined in a rise in market manipulation. An internal investigation found a 60% increase in market manipulation attempts from Q4 of 2024 to this first quarter of this year. In February, a trader manipulated the HyperLiquid JELLY market by tricking a pricing oracle, and HyperLiquid's response to the activity was met with skepticism and a subsequent outflow of capital. The burden ultimately lies with the exchanges and regulators. "Regulators should set the baseline," Dr. Jan Philipp told CoinDesk." [Regulators] should define what counts as manipulation, specify penalties and outline how platforms must respond." The regulators have certainly tried to clamp down on such schemes. In 2020, rogue trader Avi Eisenberg was found guilty of manipulating decentralized exchange Mango Markets in 2022, but the cases have been few and far between. However, crypto exchanges must also "step up their surveillance systems" and use circuit breakers while employing stricter listing requirements to clamp down on market manipulation, Philipp said. "Retail users won't stick around if they keep getting front-run, spoofed and dumped on. If crypto wants to outgrow its casino phase, we need infrastructure that rewards fair participation, not insider games," Philipp concluded.

Skip to comments. Posted on 04/29/2025 5:25:56 AM PDT by Red Badger The attempts on President Trump’s life were one of the most disturbing and suspicious events in modern political history, especially the one in Butler, Pa. And yet, barely anyone in the media seems interested in asking real questions. They’re not the least bit curious about what happened, and it’s starting to feel like they want us to forget it ever happened. But that’s not going to happen… Thanks to people like Joe Rogan and Elon Musk, the curtain is still being yanked back, and what’s behind it should send chills down every American’s spine. From a house scrubbed cleaner than Hillary Clinton’s email server to a shooter with no internet footprint to a random live CNN feed of a rally in the middle of nowhere, the details surrounding the Butler assassination attempt are filled with questions, and at this point, it’s starting to feel like a scandal. Most people don’t believe the “lone wolf” story the media tried to sell us. Many conclude that this was something much darker, and the more you hear about it, the harder it is to ignore that fact. In this powerful chat, Joe and Elon break down just how bizarre and disturbing this entire story really is. They go through the strange facts one by one, from the assassin’s spotless house and missing online life to the shady ties to BlackRock, mind-blowing Secret Service failures, and the suspicious lack of transparency from federal officials. These questions are very serious, yet nobody in power seems willing to answer them. Wall Street Apes: Never stop talking about this Joe Rogan and Elon Musk point out the INSANE details surrounding the Butler, Pennsylvania Donald Trump assassination attempt shooter – The assassins house was PROFESSIONALLY scrubbed – His home was scrubbed so well there wasn’t even silverware left in the home – No footprint on the internet – No social media footprint (completely wiped) – He was in a BlackRock commercial – Joe Rogan says some individuals inside BlackRock may have “recognized that it’s beneficial to them if he gets assassinated” – There was never a formal report – There was never press conferences where they detailed all the information they know currently and where the investigation stands at the moment – He was a very young g kid there with a rangefinder (used to measure distances, very suspicious) – CNN streamed it live, which Joe Rogan does not believe they did for any other rally. And certainly not for a rally that’s in the middle of nowhere in Pennsylvania – They wouldn’t let people be on that roof because the Secret service lady said it was sloped and it was dangerous – The snipers that were on the other roof was a, a steeper pitch (It made no ... sense) – Random people saw him and pointed him out on the roof with a gun for a long time before it happened – The kid had 5 phones – His body was immediately cremated – There was some indications that there was a phone that had been traveling from outside the FBI offices in D.C to where this kid lived multiple times We need answers. It’s absolutely mind-boggling that a former and now current president could survive two assassination attempts, and the national media hasn’t delved into it. Where are the big New York Times and WAPO investigations that would usually follow such a monumental story? This type of cover-up is what happens when you don’t have a real press. Because when the media stops being honest, corruption festers, propaganda takes over, and the American people are force-fed a diet of lies while the real bad guys stay hidden in the shadows, totally free to plot their next move. And because of this, we can’t stop demanding the truth.

The half-witted box checker made a jarring statement to ABC News, explaining that no Secret Service snipers were placed on the building from which assassin Crooks allegedly fired, because it had a “sloped roof.” Cheatle’s (uh) “resignation” should not deter us from determining the significance of S/S payroll numbers coming out of the Trump shooting debacle. <><>Cheatle employed 7100 Secret Service Special agents and 2800 Task Force Officers, plus Uniformed Division officers, Technical Law Enforcement officers, and administrative, professional, and technical personnel on the tax-paid govt payroll. Complete with perks, privileges, bonuses, and pensions. <><>Mayorkas’ Homeland Security Investigations division which apparently “lent” employees to Cheatle has over 9,800 Special Agents and tactical officers on the tax-paid govt payroll. Complete With perks privileges bonuses and pensions. <><>The Executive Office of the President of the United States employs 1800 tax-paid individuals, some 584 in the WH alone. Yet, Biden, Mayorkas and Cheatle denied Trump’s request for increased security. The Biden regime sent $200,000,000,000 tax dollars to Ukraine to protect its people, but could not find the tax dollars to beef up security for a presidential candidate.

Many conclude that this was something much darker, and the more you hear about it, the harder it is to ignore that fact. In this powerful chat, Joe and Elon break down just how bizarre and disturbing this entire story really is. They go through the strange facts one by one, from the assassin’s spotless house and missing online life to the shady ties to BlackRock, mind-blowing Secret Service failures, and the suspicious lack of transparency from federal officials. These questions are very serious, yet nobody in power seems willing to answer them. Wall Street Apes: Never stop talking about this Joe Rogan and Elon Musk point out the INSANE details surrounding the Butler, Pennsylvania Donald Trump assassination attempt shooter – The assassins house was PROFESSIONALLY scrubbed – His home was scrubbed so well there wasn’t even silverware left in the home – No footprint on the internet – No social media footprint (completely wiped) – He was in a BlackRock commercial – Joe Rogan says some individuals inside BlackRock may have “recognized that it’s beneficial to them if he gets assassinated” – There was never a formal report – There was never press conferences where they detailed all the information they know currently and where the investigation stands at the moment – He was a very young g kid there with a rangefinder (used to measure distances, very suspicious) – CNN streamed it live, which Joe Rogan does not believe they did for any other rally. And certainly not for a rally that’s in the middle of nowhere in Pennsylvania – They wouldn’t let people be on that roof because the Secret service lady said it was sloped and it was dangerous – The snipers that were on the other roof was a, a steeper pitch (It made no ... sense) – Random people saw him and pointed him out on the roof with a gun for a long time before it happened – The kid had 5 phones – His body was immediately cremated – There was some indications that there was a phone that had been traveling from outside the FBI offices in D.C to where this kid lived multiple times We need answers. It’s absolutely mind-boggling that a former and now current president could survive two assassination attempts, and the national media hasn’t delved into it. Where are the big New York Times and WAPO investigations that would usually follow such a monumental story? This type of cover-up is what happens when you don’t have a real press. Because when the media stops being honest, corruption festers, propaganda takes over, and the American people are force-fed a diet of lies while the real bad guys stay hidden in the shadows, totally free to plot their next move. And because of this, we can’t stop demanding the truth.

Where are the big New York Times and WAPO investigations that would usually follow such a monumental story? This type of cover-up is what happens when you don’t have a real press. Because when the media stops being honest, corruption festers, propaganda takes over, and the American people are force-fed a diet of lies while the real bad guys stay hidden in the shadows, totally free to plot their next move.

ByDanielle Chemtob andForbes Daily ByDanielle Chemtob, Forbes Staff andForbes Daily, Forbes Staff. Nearly 15 years ago, Bill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett teamed up to start the Giving Pledge, which encouraged the super wealthy to donate at least half their fortunes to charity. Since then, it’s gone from 40 members to 245. The group now includes members from 30 countries, though they represent just 8% of the world’s 3,028 billionaires. Ahead of its anniversary, Forbes spoke with five members about why they joined, what they’ve learned and what more they’d like to see happen. “Sooner rather than later I realized that wealth comes with both responsibility and opportunity,” says Rohini Nilekani, who is married to Infosys billionaire Nandan Nilekani. Still, fewer pledgers have joined in recent years, and there’s no way to know how many have actually fulfilled their promise. AFP via Getty Images The stock market has stumbled during President Donald Trump’s first 100 days, but one controversial company is bucking the trend: AI giant and government contractor Palantir, chaired by longtime Trump backer Peter Thiel. The company’s stock has jumped 54% since January 17, the strongest return of any company listed on the S&P 500, though the firm has faced criticism over a $30 million contract with ICE on a program to assist the agency in deportations. The Trump Administration signaled a plan that will indirectly lower tariffs on foreign-made auto parts needed to manufacture cars in the U.S., the Wall Street Journal reported, prompting automaker shares to inch up in premarket trading. While automakers will need to pay 25% tariffs on foreign-made components beginning May 3, a reported tweak to the rule will allow them to seek partial reimbursement for those levies. President Donald Trump said revenue from tariffs may “completely” eliminate income taxes for many people in the U.S., but one economic study said it would be “mathematically impossible.” The Department of Homeland Security has collected $15.86 billion in customs and excise taxes so far in April, an increase of about $6 billion from March, though the White House is still negotiating with other countries, so it’s unclear how much the tariffs will ultimately bring to U.S. coffers. Photo by MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images In an interview with The Atlantic, President Donald Trump boasted that he runs “the world” and is “having a lot of fun,” after the publication called his cellphone and he answered. Though Trump has previously criticized the magazine, he touched on several issues, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s use of the Signal chat app, the alleged deportations of Americans and Silicon Valley’s warming to him. MORE: Rep. Shri Thanedar (D-Mich.) introduced seven articles of impeachment against Trump on Monday afternoon, saying the president has “ignored the very checks and balances that keep our democracy intact.” The articles are the first formal impeachment effort of Trump's second term, though they are almost certain to fail in Congress. Secretary of State Marco Rubio defended the decision to deport three children from Louisiana who were U.S. citizens, saying it was their mothers who were deported and chose to take their children with them. “You guys just make it sound like I say, ‘Just kick down the door and grab the 2-year-old’ and threw them on an airplane. That’s misleading, that’s just not true,” Rubio said. Canada’s Prime Minister Mark Carney has secured a full term in power, and his Liberal Party was projected to win the Canadian national elections Monday. Carney, who won his seat with a comfortable 30-point margin, addressed the tension between Canada and the U.S. in his victory speech, telling supporters that “Trump is trying to break us so America can own us. That will never happen.” Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a three-day ceasefire in Ukraine from May 8 to 10 while Russia celebrates the end of World War II, as peace talks between the U.S., Ukraine and Russia have dragged on. President Donald Trump has indicated he is losing patience with Putin, and Secretary Rubio signaled recently the U.S. would walk away from the discussions if progress was not made soon. President Donald Trump has long battled with the media, but he’s increasingly using government resources to attack it. As polls published in the last week from outlets like the New York Times, ABC News, the Washington Post and Fox News show him with net negative approval ratings, Trump has called the pollsters “negative criminals.” His administration has elevated right-wing voices in the White House press corps and sought to effectively shut down federally funded media outlets, and new FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr has launched investigations into several outlets.

But the bad news is it is easy to be gouged buying either individual bonds or high-fee funds. Municipal bonds are worth considering for any fixed-income money you have in taxable accounts. Patrick Haskell, who oversees a $182 billion pile of them at BlackRock, says: “We haven’t had the opportunity to invest at these levels of real and nominal yields since the financial crisis.” The numbers he has in mind: For bonds due in 10 years, tax-exempt yields are 80% of U.S. Treasury yields, not bad for anyone destined to pay a tax of 20% or more on interest. At the 30-year mark the percentage is close to 100%. There is a catch with the long munis, having to do with the risk they will be called in early, but they remain very attractive even after allowance for this risk. Are you interested in collecting 4% interest federally tax-free? There are too many choices. Fidelity has on its sale counter 138,000 individual tax-exempt bonds. You could get a fund, but even so there is a selection process. YCharts counts 3,700, including all the share classes. On individual bonds our advice is simple: Don’t buy them. As for funds: Forbes narrowed the roster of those worth looking at to 40. WHY IT MATTERS “The U.S. equity market has been volatile and discouraging this year—so investors are looking at making their portfolios more conservative,” says Forbes senior contributor William Baldwin. “Inside an IRA or 401(k) they’d select a taxable bond fund.

Title: Economy Likely Grew At Weakest Rate In Nearly 3 Years, Experts Say

As recession fears reverberate from Washington to Wall Street, Wednesday brought the most comprehensive yardstick yet of the health of the U.S. economy yet as the government released the first estimate of the country’s gross domestic product over the first three months of 2025. Some measures tracking U.S. economic activity predict the U.S. economy actually shrank during the ... More first three months of 2025. Pictured is the Port of Long Beach. Real gross domestic product (GDP) grew -0.3% on a quarter-over-quarter, seasonally adjusted annual rate, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. That is the weakest economic growth for the U.S. since 2022’s first quarter. Consensus economist forecasts pegged last quarter’s real GDP growth at 0.4%, according to Dow Jones data, a stark decrease from the prior period’s 2.4% expansion. Data from sources following underlying measures of economic activity suggested Wednesday’s GDP reading could be even worse than that; the Atlanta Federal Reserve’s GDPNow model called for -0.4% GDP during Q1 when excluding gold imports and exports, while Goldman Sachs’ tracker indicates a 0.2% contraction. The BEA said the negative GDP reading “primarily reflected” an increase in imports, which surged as businesses aimed to front run tariffs, and a decrease in government spending. Futures tied to all three major indexes slid Wednesday morning following the GDP report. Contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average indicated a 380-point, or 0.9%, drop for the index, while S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures declined 1.4% and 1.9%, respectively. Negative GDP growth is rare for the U.S., occurring just three times over the last decade: 2020’s first two quarters as the COVID-19 pandemic ground the global economy to a halt, including a record 28% GDP contraction during the second quarter, and Q1 2022, when the Fed enacted its first interest rate hike in more than three years as inflation soared to a multidecade high. The U.S. will be one step closer to entering a recession, at least by one definition. A technical recession occurs when economic output contracts over consecutive quarters, meaning a negative reading during the second quarter would indicate such a downturn. The National Bureau of Economic Research defines a recession as “a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months,” meaning consecutive quarters of slightly negative GDP growth may not officially trigger a recession. Some trusted observers of the economy believe the U.S. could already be on the cusp of a recession, such as BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, while major banks largely view it as a tossup whether or not the U.S. enters such a downturn, including the U.S.’ largest bank JPMorgan Chase, whose economists forecast a 60% chance of a recession this year. The GDP reading comes as economists debate the growing disconnect between “hard” and “soft” economic metrics. Hard data such as job growth and retail sales indicate a steady economy while survey-based measures reveal Americans’ faith in the economy has dropped precipitously, as the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment poll revealed the weakest sentiment since July 2022. The disconnect comes as Trump has pursued the most aggressive tariffs since before World War I during the early stages of his second term. The ever-changing nature of Trump’s trade stances have also complicated analysis of the regularly scheduled updates on the U.S. economy. For example, this week’s GDP reading includes data through March 31 – two days before Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcement which triggered historic stock market losses, and nine days before Trump backpedaled on many of his most aggressive country-by-country import taxes. “Tariffs function like a tax hike, tighten financial conditions, and increase uncertainty for businesses,” Goldman economists led by David Mericle wrote in a Sunday note to clients, explaining how the levies weigh on GDP growth.

Title: Americans fear an imminent recession. That may be enough to put us in one | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: A powerful force is dominating the Trump economy: fear. About two-thirds (66%) of adults say they are pessimistic or afraid about the economy, according to new findings from a CNN/SSRS poll released Monday. Just 34% say they feel enthusiastic or optimistic. The overwhelming majority – 69% – consider an economic recession in the next year to be at least somewhat likely, including 32% who say it’s very likely. This sense of dread in the first 100 days of the second Trump presidency isn’t just a political problem for the White House. It’s also a psychological problem for an economy that requires consumer spending to stay afloat. This raises the risk of a recession becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Fear of a recession causes Americans to shop less and save more. Vacations aren’t booked. Cars aren’t purchased. Restaurants aren’t full. CEOs, worried about consumers hunkering down, do the same. They hire fewer and fire more. And that causes consumers to pull back even further, prompting even more layoffs. It can become a negative feedback loop that is hard to break. The economy and financial markets are a confidence game – one that has been shaken by President Donald Trump’s trade war and sweeping April 2 tariff announcement, attacks on Federal Reserve independence and chaotic policymaking. “April 2nd was a turning point. It’s been four weeks of chaos, and the chaos has been disruptive. We are beginning to pay the price for it,” said David Kotok, co-founder of ﻿investment management firm Cumberland Advisors. It’s clear that consumer sentiment has been dropping. The CNN poll found that seven in 10 of those under the age of 45 express pessimism or fear about the economy. So do 76% of Americans of color. And it’s true that Democrats are more pessimistic than Republicans about the state of affairs. But the CNN poll found bipartisan economic concerns, with 39% of those who voted for Trump in 2024 saying a recession is very or somewhat likely in the next year. Still, it’s far too early to know if the turbulence in financial markets will short-circuit the economic expansion that began after the Covid-19 pandemic crash. It’s entirely possible that weak consumer confidence does not cause a drop in consumer spending. That’s exactly what happened in 2022, a time when many consumers and economists were similarly sounding the recession alarm – only to be proven wrong. The US economy has proven very resilient. It shook off multiple Covid variants, the supply chain mess, the inflation crisis and the regional bank failures of 2023. And so far this year, there isn’t much evidence that Americans have stopped spending. Retail sales jumped and car sales surged in March as consumers tried to beat the clock on tariffs. Restaurant reservations on OpenTable are higher than a year ago. And it’s possible that the massive rebound in US stocks after Trump delayed country-specific tariffs for 90 days could improve the mood on main street as it did on Wall Street. Weak confidence among consumers could interrupt the business cycle. “A lot of businesses are getting nervous. They could pause spending or cut back on travel and hiring. And that’s what could make this a self-fulfilling prophecy,” David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, told CNN in a phone interview. Consider that 81% of small toy companies and 87% of mid-sized toy companies are delaying orders due to tariffs, according to an April survey by the Toy Association, a trade group. That same survey found that almost half of all small- and mid-sized toy makers say they will go out of business within weeks or months. “We are starting to see the first signs of the supply chain breakdown from tariffs. My expectation is that it will worsen,” said Kotok, who pointed to a surge of container ships sitting offshore and canceled sailings. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink recently said many business leaders fear the US economy is already in a recession, and JPMorgan’s Kelly said he is most concerned about how CEOs will respond to economic worries. Just last week, Southwest Airlines CEO Bob Jordan highlighted most severe drop in domestic leisure travel outside of the pandemic, telling Bloomberg News: “I don’t care if you call it a recession or not, in this industry, that’s a recession.” Kelly said it may be a “shallow” recession but “the odds still favor us slipping into recession unless we see a sharp about-face on tariffs.” Torsten Slok, chief economist at investment firm Apollo Global Management, goes a step further, saying there is a 90% chance of a “voluntary trade reset recession.” “Expect ships to sit offshore, orders to be canceled, and well-run generational retailers to file for bankruptcy,” Slok wrote earlier this month in a report. Jared Bernstein, a top economist for President Joe Biden during the last recession scare in 2022, cautioned against assuming a recession is inevitable. “We’ve gone through years of bad vibes and good data. We have to be careful not to over-torque on this,” Bernstein told CNN in a phone interview. Still, Bernstein sees a roughly 50/50 chance of a US recession because of the stagflationary shock from tariffs, which are expected to simultaneously slow the economy and increase prices. The policy whiplash is also a problem. “Even if we believe (Trump) will dial back the trade war,” Bernstein said, “how confident can we be that he won’t dial back his dial-back the next day?” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Title: Chokepoint Crazy: The U.S. Bombs Both Sides of Gulf of Aden and Considers Setting Up Shop in Somaliland

The bombing of Yemen is hogging most of the attention, but the US is also dramatically upping its airstrikes across the Gulf of Aden in Somalia as Washington struggles to fulfill goals of dominating key shipping chokepoints. We’ve seen the Trump administration lean on Greenland, Panama, and Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK Hutchison Holdings to sell its dozens of global ports to a consortium that includes BlackRock. And then there’s the intensification of bombings in Somalia and Yemen. That’s not going so well, as the US Navy losing an F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jet to Houthi fire on Sunday demonstrates. Yet, the US is likely to continue doubling down in the region as it has been doing. According to the neocon Foundation for Defense of Democracies, “in just the first three months of President Donald Trump’s second term, his administration has already launched at least 16 manned aircraft or drone strikes inside Somalia, according to numbers compiled by FDD’s Long War Journal. For comparison, the Biden administration only launched 10 such strikes in 2024.” The number of Trump strikes might also be an undercount, since the US military’s Africa Command no longer provides specific details of such operations after the White House greenlit a more liberal policy allowing American commanders to authorize airstrikes and special operation raids outside conventional battlefields, broadening the range of people who can be targeted for death. During his first overseas trip in February, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth signed the directive easing policy constraints and executive oversight in a meeting with senior U.S. military leaders from AFRICOM in Germany. As the collapsed Horn of Africa country is the recipient of increased violence from the “America First” administration, we’re getting scary stories that “The Islamic State has regrouped in Somalia — and has global ambitions.” As always, the result of US counterterrorism strategy is that terrorism continues to magically spread like wildfire and that the US must bomb Somalia to smithereens in order to prevent ISIS from continuing to spread. It also conveniently coincides with the US’ desire to increase its presence in the Horn of Africa with an eye towards a battle over Red Sea shipping. Samar Al-Bulushi and Dr. Ahmed Ibrahim writing at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft believe this is the case: It is a clear indication of the growing geopolitical significance of the Horn of Africa, and comes at a time of mounting concerns (mostly attempts by Yemen’s Houthis to disrupt global shipping in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza) about securing the flow of international commerce via the Red Sea. And American international commerce should be favored, according to Trump who on Sunday demanded free transit for US ships crossing the Panama and Suez canals. Okay then. What Would Somaliland Provide? There were recently rumors that the US and Israel were considering “relocating” Gazans to Somaliland among other locations, but this ignores the fact that Palestinians do not want to be driven out of their homeland and many would rather die than do so. While it wouldn’t stop Israel or the US, it’s worth mentioning that forced deportation of populations is also a crime against humanity and could be considered genocide under Article 7 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. There also haven’t been any serious talks with Somaliland about such a scheme yet with the region’s foreign minister saying that Somalialnd must be on the road to recognition for any such conversations to proceed. Nevertheless, Somaliland is attempting to position itself as a strong US partner by appealing to Washington’s desire to counter Chinese influence. Somalia is countering by upping its offers to the US. Both highlight how the US is desperate to make moves in the region in a bid to control vital shipping lanes and gain an upper hand in what Washington views as a global battle against China. In a March 16 letter, Somalia’s President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud offers the US “strategically positioned assets” to “bolster American engagement in the region, ensuring uninterrupted military and logistical access while preventing external competitors from establishing a presence in this critical corridor.” The “assets” are the Berbera port and airbase in Somaliland and the Bosaso port and airbase in Puntland, both of which could be used to monitor and counter Houthi attacks on genocide-friendly commercial vessels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. The problem is that these areas are not under the control of Somalia, which has been blown to bits by multiple warring factions engaged in permanent civil war. Puntland severed ties with Mogadishu last March following years of political disputes.The Islamic State allegedly has a heavy presence in Puntland, and is one of the primary targets of the more frequent US airstrikes, and Bosaso is being transformed into a mega base for the breakaway region’s defense forces attacks against IS. In Somaliland, which occupies approximately 20 percent of Somalia’s territory and is home to about a third of the population, the situation is comparatively peaceful, and the standard of living is much higher. [1] Source: @Dani6CBP Somaliland has been seeking recognition as an independent state for more than three decades, and in 2022 the government there already offered the US access to the Berbera port in exchange for recognition. The Trump administration might jump at the offer in an attempt to combat China. Djibouti and China There is also the issue of China’s military base in Djibouti. The US, Germany, Japan, and Italy all had military presences in Djibouti, but it became a problem when China opened its first foreign military base there in 2017. Beijing’s stated interest — like the others — is to protect its shipping. And according to Responsible Statecraft, “Djibouti is also important for China’s Belt and Road Initiative as a key maritime stop and a new railway line to Ethiopia’s capital Addis Ababa that connects the countries. China is the largest investor in Djibouti, with a total of $14.4 billion in infrastructure being built, a huge sum for an economy that is only worth $4.67 billion.” For the US, however, it is unacceptable, and Washington became more determined to do something about it when Djibouti denied the US request to use its territory for attacks against the Houthis targeting ships trading with Israel. The US blamed China for Djibouti’s decision. Under Trump, the desperation to counter China is leading to a renewed focus on Somalia and Somaliland: Rather than accept Djibouti’s position, foreign policy experts have sought to escalate tensions, blaming Djibouti for being pro-Houthi and pro-China. Hoping to find a more reliable partner, many propose that the United States recognize and work with Somaliland instead. Somaliland is an unrecognized state that asserted its independence from Somalia in 1991. Close to Yemen and next Somalia, it seems Somaliland offers everything Djibouti has with no strings attached. Project 2025 recommends “the recognition of Somaliland statehood as a hedge against the U.S.’s deteriorating position in Djibouti.” As Semafor first reported in December, members of the US president’s new team have expressed interest in recognizing Somaliland: The move could enable US intelligence to set up long term operations to monitor the movement of weapons in a volatile region as well as keep an eye on Chinese activity. And in January an influential US-China subcommittee in the US House of Representatives called for the State Department to open a representative office in Somaliland. The increase of US airstrikes in Somalia is likely to only destabilize the situation further, leading to increased calls for Somaliland recognition. Again, the Trump administration is just ramping up existing US policy with a twist. Collective Biden formally upheld Somalia’s territorial integrity, but the Pentagon showed interest in a presence in Berbera, with several visits by Africom officials. Last year, the US signed a deal with the government of Somalia to construct up to five military bases for the Somali National Army in the name of bolstering the army’s capabilities in the ongoing fight against militant groups. The bases are intended for the Danab (“Lightning”) Brigade, a U.S.-sponsored Special Ops Force that was established in 2014. The US at first funded Danab from the State Department, which contracted with private security firm Bancroft Global. More recently, funding comes from the Pentagon’s proxy war fund called the 127e program, which bypasses congressional oversight by allowing US special operations forces to use foreign military units as surrogates in counterterrorism missions. Despite the fact that Somalia receives US aid to pay government salaries, it launched a mega lobbying campaign following Trump’s victory, hiring big time firms like BGR . According to Africa Report, the Somali president is also attempting to win over Elon Musk by giving him a Starlink license to operate in the country. Mogadishu is also going on a Washington lobbyist hiring spree. The US Doesn’t Do Nation Building As Team Trump considers Somaliland recognition, the foreign policy team green lighting strikes in Somalia reportedly believes that state-building there is futile. They’re not necessarily wrong, but what they get right is for the wrong reasons. From Geeska: We are now witnessing the clear unveiling of what remains of the fig leaf that the international community had wrapped itself in when dealing with Somali affairs. This same community had previously imposed a coercive state-building model in Somalia through military interventions and, in 2013, granted sovereign recognition to the Mogadishu government as the legitimate successor of the post-independence Somali Republic. This project later evolved into a system resembling a cottage industry run by a narrow group of experts and opportunistic politicians shuttling between Mogadishu and Nairobi under the guise of constructing a federal governance model, backed by regional forces that are periodically rotated every few years. At its core, however, this process was nothing more than a fragile arrangement to reconcile former warlords, jihadist movement leaders, and local clan politicians. As this model has gradually collapsed over time due to both internal and external factors, the international community now implicitly acknowledges that the Somali Republic no longer exists in practice. What remains is a fragile entity dependent on international donors, African peacekeeping forces and Turkish largesse, which barely exercises control beyond the capital. The Trump administration’s policies serve as a new kind of threat, as it attempts to formalise its engagement with the de facto authorities, sidelining the de jure situation that operates on the assumption that Somalia is a sovereign state, rather than a space where international powers manage threats to their interests. And so the US, having helped destabilize Somalia, might now place its bets on Somaliland. Should it do so, it would be somewhat reminiscent of another state the US blessed with the aim of a military presence and a geoeconomic win. Following the NATO bombing of Serbia in 1999 Washington helped bring about the creation of Kosovo. While a lot of people in the US profited handsomely from all the death and destruction, Kosovo remains to this day a state on life support. Politico did a piece on the US failure last year and the author was astounded to witness Washington’s failures despite Kosovo’s small size and GDP of just $10 billion — “less than one-quarter the size of Vermont’s, the smallest US state in terms of economic activity.” It’s surprising that the author is surprised. The US can’t even do nation building in the US. What makes anyone think they have any interest in Kosovo or Somaliland aside from the plunder and moves on the Great Game board? Politico does admit that “Washington’s priorities were informed more by short-term American business interests, than providing the country what it really needed to develop.” The US did, however, open Camp Bondsteel. It’s the biggest (almost 1,000 acres) and most expensive US military base built in Europe in 50-plus years. It now sits mostly empty and has earned the nickname the “Forgotten Battalion.” Maybe they can be relocated to Somaliland. Notes [1] Part of the reason the situation is relatively calm in Somaliland might include the local government’s ruthlessness in cracking down on dissent. As Kit Klarenberg recalls: In late 2022, mass protests broke out in the contested Somalian city of Las Anod. Somaliland security forces crushed the upheaval using lethal force, leaving dozens dead. Unrest only intensified thereafter, leading to Somaliland’s military savagely shelling the city the next year. An April 2023Amnesty International report branded the assault “indiscriminate” in the extreme, with civilian infrastructure, including hospitals, schools and mosques struck, hundreds killed and injured, and hundreds of thousands displaced. The Empire of Evil is an understatement. I am sad to say. Thank you, Conor. Blighty, even with 5m children living in poverty, has sent HMS Prince of Wales and its carrier group, mainly non-UK vessels, to the Indian and Pacific Oceans. The group will sail via Suez, the second such deployment since the Queen Elizabeth deployed “east of Suez” in 2022, “a Brexit benefit” according to Johnson. Starmer spent the night before the fleet left aboard the Prince of Wales. One wonders if, en route to the South China Sea, the EU’s back yard according to von der Leyen, the carrier group will engage Ansarallah or what were called “fuzzy wuzzies” when Blighty was winning at Fashoda, Khartoum and Omdurman. Dad served with the RAF in Aden, so we are looking forward to the next iteration and how forces have recalibrated since the mid-1960s. Perhaps, a ship or two will make a detour for Crimea, like in 2022, and, again quoting Johnson, “poke the bear”. Are there any easy wars left to fight? BTW, I don’t think there’s any truth to the rumour that an Indian dock, or that beach where ships go to die, has been booked in case the Prince of Wales breaks down. Johnson, Starmer and Trump have some things in common, but I don’t know if Trump has children out of wedlock, the result of playing away from home. Thanks Colonel, In the meantime, Sweden is doing its best to become a third world nation by shovelling even more money to Ukraine https://thetransnational.substack.com/p/swedens-19th-aid-package-for-ukraine The CIA sure knew what they were doing when they organised the assassination of Palme with the connivance/looked the other way, of the Swedish security forces. Thank you, John. I don’t know about Sweden, but often see the benefits of the “aid” in the form of high end vehicles and fine dining in London, the south of England, Paris, Paris sur Mer / 21eme arrondissement and the Cote d’Azur. Private school fees are paid by local authorities, so a different pot to the above. Thank you, Colonel. If I remember correctly, when the British left Aden didn’t they have to virtually shoot their way out of that place instead of a quite hand-over ceremony like in most other places? Aden always was a tough place. Thank you, Rev. It was a bit. Think of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Good times, especially when people like my johnny foreigner dad fought for God, Queen and Country, as opposed to Zionist chicken hawks now. “Perhaps, a ship or two will make a detour for Crimea, like in 2022, and, again quoting Johnson, “poke the bear”.” They have to poke first the New Ottomans, to get permission to enter the Black Sea… Fortunately for the US before they head off into Somaliland, they will be able to draw from many experts that have knowledge of the culture and religion and the people in this region, know who the different factions are, know who the real players are behind the scenes, know the history of this area which particular emphasis on recent history, what cultural taboos they need to be careful of, which countries are supplying military expertise and equipment to the different factions, how the US can go in and have the locals see them as a reliable partner worth trusting, what the short and long term budgetary requirements will be needed to make full use of limited resources and so forth. Psych! Thank you, Rev. Why? A PPE from Oxford is more than enough and shouting at johnny foreigners in a plummy accent, perhaps wearing a pith helmet. And that is precisely what they won’t do. It is not the American way. I believe that what Trump’s referencing when he says the US ‘should be favored’ is that we have guaranteed unimpeded transit to a bunch of countries as per some previous accord, sometimes–the US military felt–to the neglect of US shipping, as our ability to spread the umbrella for all became more and more limited under Biden.

Title: BlackRock’s IBIT Sees Second-Largest Bitcoin Inflow Since Launch, Nearing $1 Billion
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/04/29/blackrocks-ibit-sees-second-largest-bitcoin-inflow-since-launch-nearing-1-billion

The BlackRock iShares Bitcoin (BTC) Trust ETF (IBIT) saw $970.9 million in inflows, marking its second-largest net inflow since launching in January 2024, according to Farside data. Monday accounted for $591.2 million in new capital, which saw heavy outflows from competitors: Fidelity’s FBTC lost $86.9 million, Bitwise’s BITB dropped $21.1 million, and ARK’s ARKB saw $226.3 million in outflows. The rise comes alongside a 7.2% rise in BTC over the past seven days with it now trading at $94,900. Since April 22, IBIT has amassed over $4.5 billion in net inflows, bucking the market trend. Industry experts have taken note. Nate Geraci, President of The ETF Store, remarked: Eric Balchunas, Senior Bloomberg ETF Analyst, added: Meanwhile, in derivatives markets, open interest (OI) on CME Bitcoin Futures continues to fall, now sitting at 132,750 BTC after four consecutive days of decline, according to CME data. The recent decline in open interest could be coming to an end, as the annualized basis yield has climbed from around 5% to 9% in April, according to Velo data. This resurgence in basis trade profitability could prompt renewed activity and a short-term rebound in open interest. Why it matters: In a typical basis trade, investors buy spot bitcoin and short bitcoin futures to lock in the price gap. When the yield is high, demand for futures rises, boosting OI. As the yield shrinks, fewer traders engage in the strategy, leading to declining open interest and signaling reduced leverage in the market.

Title: Gerry Thornley: all four Irish provinces beaten on same weekend for first time since March 2015

Time Published: 2025-04-29T05:00:01Z
Full Content:
All seems even less hunky dory underneath the surface after that weekend. For the first time since March 2015 all four Irish sides lost on the same weekend, on top of which the Ireland women’s team suffered their most sobering reality check of the campaign. That said, for those in Clontarf, Nenagh, Trinity, Dungannon, Skerries and Thomond it was the best weekend of the season. The last time all four Irish provinces lost on the same weekend was in the old Pro 12, when the quartet each suffered defeats to Welsh opposition. As then Leinster lost away to the Scarlets, while Munster, beaten in Cardiff on Friday night, lost to the Ospreys a decade ago. Connacht had a fall off in performance after their brave effort in defeat to the Stormers when losing to the Lions last Saturday, while Ulster were worn down by the Sharks’ superior physicality and depth on Saturday night. Leinster, of course, could afford just a second defeat of the season, especially as Glasgow were outmuscled at home by the Stormers on Friday night, so maintaining the eight-point gap at the top the table ahead of next Saturday’s Champions Cup showdown against a dangerous Northampton. Victory at home to Zebre a week later would ensure top seeding in the BKT URC playoffs ahead of their final game at home to Glasgow; additionally helpful if they have reached a fourth successive Champions Cup final a week later. By contrast Munster, Ulster and Connacht have all fallen outside the top eight, and there is a distinct likelihood that Ireland will only have two sides in next season’s Champions Cup for the first time ever, with the possibility that this may even be one side. That would be quite a fall. Munster and Ulster meet at Thomond Park next Friday week in what is now a dog-eat-dog scrap for playoff and Champions Cup qualification between two provinces who have been ever-presents in the 30 years of the latter competition. While Munster now sit ninth behind Benetton, with both on 41 points, by dint of winning less matches they have their destiny in their own hands as they also host the Italian outfit at Musgrave Park in the final round six nights later. By contrast an Ulster squad even more lacking in depth sit in 12th on 38 points, and so their need is the more acute in Thomond Park ahead of a trek to Edinburgh, who are 10th, on the ensuing Friday. Connacht’s chances of the top eight are more remote as they sit 14th on 35 points and must finish with wins at home to Edinburgh and away to Zebre if they are to have any chance of a top-eight place. Significantly, the Welsh quartet finish their campaigns with two games in South Africa. The fear always lurked that for all the huge improvement in the Ireland women’s team in the last 12 months some of it had to be attributed to the return of Olympian Sevens players who were unavailable in last season’s Six Nations, and that while they have become a good team they are not yet a good squad. In the absence of the hugely influential Sam Monaghan, Erin King and Aoife Wafer, that lack of depth was further exposed when losing Edel McMahon and Dorothy Wall in the first half of last Saturday’s loss to Scotland in Edinburgh. It’s still been a campaign of progress, with more competitive displays at home to England and France, as well as the high point of the win in Parma. But Saturday’s defeat is a setback psychologically, and certainly gives the first World Cup warm-up match against Scotland in Cork on August 2nd more significance. Either way while a World Cup semi-final is still a viable target, beating New Zealand again in the pool stages or overcoming France in the quarter-final looks a tall order, particularly after the stirring late comeback by Les Bleus in losing 43-42 in Saturday’s Grand Slam decider against England. Amid all this club rugby was seen at its best on the final weekend of the AIL as UL Bohs and Clontarf secured All-Ireland titles again at the Aviva Stadium. À la the Joey Carbery final when Clontarf beat Cork Constitution in 2016, last Sunday wasn’t quite the Hugh Cooney final, but it wasn’t far off it either. As a Clontarf centre who came through Blackrock, Cooney is not the first to plot such a journey, and while not wanting to saddle him unduly with comparisons to The Great One, with his leg power, explosiveness, pace and low centre of gravity the 21-year-old has similar attributes. Cooney and Hugh Gavin look like being the first of the new crop of young centres coming through to be capped this summer in Tbilisi or Georgia. Meanwhile Nenagh Ormond became the first Tipperary club to be promoted to Division 1A and Trinity preserved their 1B status with dramatic two-score comebacks at home to wilting UCC and Cashel sides. Dungannon won promotion to 1B by winning in Navan, Skerries stayed in 2B by beating Midleton at home, and Thomond reclaimed their AIL status by winning in Omagh in the only game that wasn’t a one-score affair. The league has found a niche. Ten-team divisions and playoffs ensure jeopardy and a dearth of dead rubbers until the very end. But having the finals a week after the semi-finals, which are just a fortnight after the three-game rush to the season’s final standings, is just too demanding a load for the mostly amateur and semi-pro players. The best final of recent times was two years ago, when Terenure beat Clontarf 50-24, which was a fortnight after the semi-finals. That’s the way it should be. The AIL finals could have been held next Sunday, on the May bank holiday weekend, which would also help rather than hinder clubs outside Dublin such as Cork Constitution in bringing members and fans to Dublin. It would also afford the IRFU, sponsors and finalists two weeks to promote the finals. The May bank holiday weekend should be enshrined in the club calendar as All-Ireland club rugby weekend. If occasionally this clashed with Leinster matches or the finals were lost to either TG4 or from the Aviva to somewhere else nor would that be the end of the world. gerry.thornley@irishtimes.com Sign up to the Irish Times weekly rugby digest for the view from the press box with Gerry Thornley © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Irish drummer Kevin Brady: ‘Most nights you’re able to hear great live jazz. But we need something like classical has in the NCH’

Time Published: 2025-04-29T04:15:00Z
Full Content:
There is a photograph of the quartet led by the Irish jazz drummer Kevin Brady that makes it look a little like a Scandi death-metal band. The American keyboardist Bill Carrothers – buzz-cut, beard and steely eye – is decked out in camouflaged military-style hunting jacket. The London-born, Vancouver-raised and Cologne-based saxophonist Seamus Blake, whose father was from Dublin, is peering out over lowered eyebrows with what comes across as a combination of scepticism and menace. Brady, who is dressed, like Blake, all in black, is solemn, glassy-eyed and half in deep shadow. The Irish bassist Dave Redmond, to the rear, looks, as Brady jokes to me, “like he urgently needs to be somewhere else”. In reality, the group, which works under the banner of the Kevin Brady Electric Quartet – in which Carrothers plays Fender Rhodes electric piano, Redmond switches to electric bass and Brady is increasingly integrating electronic drum percussion – is one of the most acclaimed and ambitious international jazz ensembles working in Ireland. Formed in 2019, the band combines a highly intuitive and interactive Irish rhythm section that has played together for 20 years or more with two of the most gifted and admired, if sometimes criminally undervalued, musicians in modern jazz. Carrothers, who is based in Michigan, has a long association with Redmond and Brady – as a piano trio they have released three highly rated studio albums, many featuring Carrothers’s winningly eclectic compositions – and he is renowned for his harmonic elegance, broad musical knowledge and many-sided virtuosity. Blake, a master tenor saxophonist, is a muscular and commanding soloist somewhat in the Michael Brecker and Chris Potter mode, yet with his own elastic sound, advanced sense of lyricism and endlessly inventive style. The overall result lands in several sweet spots between late-1960s Miles Davis and early-1970s Herbie Hancock: liquid electric postbop with catchy melodies, deep grooves, rhythmic ingenuity, consummate improvisation and a strikingly contemporary edge. While the group’s multinational nature and heavily in-demand members may make regular creative get-togethers something of a challenge, the Electric Quartet has released one celebrated album, Plan B – “timeless, joyous music that will further burnish the reputations of all concerned”, according to the Irish Times review. Next month the band embarks on one of its rare tours of Ireland, playing seven dates across the island. Brady is a highly respected musician and teacher. A fluid and versatile drummer with a great sense of swing, he can play anything from funk to free jazz, but he is primarily influenced by some of the pioneering American drummers of the 1950s and 1960s, including Tony Williams, Max Roach, Jimmy Cobb, Art Taylor and Elvin Jones – as well as the irresistible polyrhythms of Afro-Cuban and Brazilian music. “In the 20 years I’ve been coming to Ireland, Kevin’s the best drummer I’ve heard,” Carrothers says. As a side musician and group anchor, Brady, who is 51, has become exceptionally popular with bands both in Ireland and abroad. At home he has been a crucial member of groups led by the guitarist Tommy Halferty, the pianist Phil Ware and the keyboardist Scott Flanigan, and by the saxophonists Richie Buckley and Meilana Gillard; in addition he has performed and recorded with Irish acts ranging from Van Morrison to the Irish Baroque Orchestra, Gráda to Dave Geraghty of Bell X1. [ Kevin Brady Electric Quartet: Plan B – an engrossing new musical directionOpens in new window ] Brady has also worked with the English jazz vocalists Norma Winstone and Ian Shaw, the American saxophonist and 1960s James Brown creative force Pee Wee Ellis, and the American guitarist and “godfather of fusion” Larry Coryell, among many others. “I try to bring an emotional response to any music I’m involved in, and an energy,” he says. “I want the music to be active.” He is also the composer of tight, melodically strong and rhythmically dynamic tunes that defy the lazy commonplace that drummers are there to keep time, not contribute original music. “The idea that if you play drums you’ve got no sense of cop-on with regard to knowing what a scale or a chord or a melody is … I think we’re way past that now,” he says. We meet in the recital room of Newpark Academy of Music, in Blackrock in south Dublin – “this room has been the venue for masterclasses by many great visiting jazz musicians, including the drummer Art Blakey,” he says – where Brady has been teaching drums for approaching 25 years; he is also head of the jazz programme at the school and lectures on the BA jazz degree course at Dublin City University. For participants who range from toddlers to final-year secondary students, Newpark is “the gold standard of musical education in Ireland”; founded in 1979, it is a registered charity with 42 staff and 600 students. Hozier is one of its alumni. Last year, at short notice, it was threatened with closure. Brady was one of the leaders of the campaign that saved the centre; from September the academy will transfer to new, though as yet unannounced, premises nearby. “I think people saw the importance of what’s been achieved here, both in the past and for the future,” Brady says. “If you start closing down music schools that have legacies like Newpark, then that’s not a world I would like to be living in.” Brady was born in Dublin. Neither of his parents was a musician, though his father sang in local musical societies, had a large vinyl collection and was a passionate fan of big-band jazz, as well as of the artistry of the trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie and the singer Sarah Vaughan. He began private piano lessons at the age of six, progressing through to the highest grades; a couple of years later he began playing trumpet, and later cornet, in a local concert band that sometimes toured Europe. In his teenage years Brady began playing keyboards in local jam bands, moving to drums “purely by coincidence” when one drummer failed to show for a rehearsal. He began teaching himself, initially falling under the influence of Stewart Copeland, the multifaceted American drummer from The Police, and at 17 began lessons at Newpark with the drummer Conor Guilfoyle. “I remember Kevin being a really good student with a voracious appetite to learn; like he is now, he was a complete enthusiast,” Guilfoyle says. “He wasn’t playing jazz at this point, more funk and rock, but he had a really good time feel. And that’s essential. It means you can adapt to many different styles of music – and also that good musicians will always want to play with you.” Increasingly drawn towards jazz – one of the earliest sparks was the present his father gave him for Christmas when he was 13: Wynton Marsalis’s Marsalis Standard Time, Vol 1 – he gave up a place studying classical music at University College Dublin in favour of a life practising, taking private lessons and playing blues and rock gigs. When he was 22, on Guilfoyle’s advice, he studied for six months at the prestigious Drummers Collective in New York; shortly after he took the year-long newly formed professional musician training course at Newpark set up by Ronan and Conor Guilfoyle. He has never looked back. Since then, over the past quarter-century or more, he has led an exemplary jazz life in Ireland, albeit one that has not exactly made him wealthy. He has admirably sought to advance his skills by studying with drummers and percussionists in the United States, Cuba and Brazil. And, from his early 30s, he has led bands and developed a reputation for being enterprising and hardworking, for being the kind of musician who consistently makes things happen. “His determination and discipline towards grant writing and procuring gigs is pretty legendary. He’s a dog on a bone,” Carrothers says. As a linchpin of the domestic music scene, Brady is also extremely well placed to gauge the state of jazz in Ireland. “I think it’s pretty healthy,” he says, quick as a flash. “Most nights, in Dublin at least, you’re going to be able to hear great live jazz featuring both established and younger musicians. “But one thing we’re lacking as a major capital in Europe is a government-backed centre for jazz and improvised music,” he adds. “Somewhere with a 300- to 400-seat venue, education and outreach programmes, resources, an archive, all sorts of stuff that would promote and preserve the music. Something like classical music has in the National Concert Hall and trad has with Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann. [ Newpark Academy of Music saved from closure through licence reprieveOpens in new window ] “I know the audience is there, 100 per cent. As is the interest in jazz; I can see it in my students. But we need to follow through and take the initiative, take the next step. A dedicated venue would be a massive bonus not just for jazz in Ireland but for the whole country.” The Kevin Brady Electric Quartet plays the Yeats Building, Sligo, on Sunday, May 4th; Magy’s Farm, Dromara, Co Down, on Monday, May 5th; Riverbank Arts Centre, Newbridge, Co Kildare, on Wednesday, May 7th; Solstice Arts Centre, Navan, on Thursday, May 8th; Wexford Arts Centre on Friday, May 9th; Arthur’s Blues & Jazz Club, Dublin, on Saturday, May 10th; and Triskel Christchurch, Cork, on Friday, May 16th.

Title: Charlamagne tells Hakeem Jeffries, Chuck Schumer to 'cut it out' over hypocritical oligarchy concerns

CNN panelists were unimpressed by Sen. Chuck Schumer touting a "very strong letter" he wrote to President Trump over his attacks on Harvard University. Charlamagne tha God called out Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., for hypocrisy over their sudden concern about big money in politics. "I think it's ridiculous even when they try to say things, you know, all these conversations about oligarchy, oligarchy, oligarchy," Charlamagne said on "The Breakfast Club" Monday. "Now Bernie [Sanders] and AOC, they can go out there and say, ‘Fight the oligarchy.’ Hakeem Jeffries, you can't say that, okay, like, cut it out, we know that you've taken so much money from corporate donors." "So, it's just weird to see them, you know, push back against oligarchy now and say, 'Look at the billionaires controlling Trump.' It's like, really? You, Hakeem, really? Chuck Schumer, really?" Charlamagne added. According to OpenSecrets.org, some of Schumer’s biggest donations come from corporations, including Blackstone Group, Nextera Energy, Newmark Group, and L3Harris Technologies. SCHUMER REFUSES TO RULE OUT IMPEACHMENT: ‘TRUMP IS VIOLATING RULE OF LAW IN EVERY WAY’ Charlamagne tha God is schooling Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries over what he calls their sudden apportion to big money in politics. (Getty Images) Previous reporting from Fox News Digital found that Democracy PAC II, tied to George Soros, gave $2.5 million to Schumer’s Senate Majority PAC in 2024. Democracy PAC II also gave $3.5 million in calendar year 2022, and $2.5 million in calendar year 2021, for a total of $6 million. Jeffries’ profile on OpenSecrets.org is similar, with some of his largest donations coming from BlackRock Inc and Lockheed Martin. Furthermore, in February, Politico reported that Jeffries met privately with major donors in Silicon Valley. "I know there are some people that think Joe Biden should help rebuild because, as the most recent president, he is the de facto leader of the party. And to those people, I’d like to say: Hunter, lay off the crack," Charlamagne joked. "So who’s supposed to be the leaders? Well, in Congress, you’ve got two people. The first one is this guy, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries." He then showed a video of Jeffries wearing a suit with no tie and sunglasses outside the U.S. Capitol Building, talking about democracy. Charlamagne then called Schumer "Payless Obama’s counterpart in the Senate," and said that he was "even less inspiring." Charlamagne has been critical of the two Congressional Democrat minority leaders before, recently mocking them as party leaders and saying they should be "thrown out of office."

Cory Booker, D-N.J., held a sit-in on the steps of the U.S. Capitol to protest President Donald Trump's budget bill and cuts they claim will be made to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.
