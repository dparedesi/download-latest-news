We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI News Investors Should Not Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other AI news investors should not miss. According to Ark Invest, an investment manager focused on disruptive technologies, artificial intelligence breakthroughs are expected to increase the share of the global equity market associated with disruptive innovation from 16% to 60% by 2030. With inflation transitioning to deflation in several sectors, the firm believes that five innovation platforms, namely robotics, energy storage, AI, blockchain, and multi-OMIC (biological analysis) sequencing will be profoundly impacting macroeconomic metrics over the next few years. “Interest rates are likely to surprise on the low side of expectations, broadening the equity rally from a narrow subset of stocks and reinforcing the need for diversified AI investments.” -Catherine Wood, CEO and CIO Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. One of the firm's ETFs with the investment theme of next-generation internet outperformed broad-based global equity indices in the third quarter, benefiting from its holdings in companies involved in innovative technologies. The year-to-date performance of the fund is 16.81%, outperforming its category by 1.59 percentage points year-to-date. In light of this trend, joining CNBC’s “The Exchange”, technology reporter Kate Rooney revealed how Wall Street is trying to cash in on the AI craze using AI itself. According to Rooney, the new world of generative AI is starting an “arms race for hedge funds”. Modern versions of AI today are better than human traders in ways more than one. They learn from mistakes and get smarter along the way, and they ultimately require minimal human intervention. Combining this with the rise of OpenAI and Anthropic, these “off-the-shelf” models tend to be cheaper. Moreover, while human traders may be capable, they often succumb to emotions and tend to make mistakes. This is why Intelligent Alpha CEO Doug Clinton believes that a “lack of emotion” is actually the edge or “superpower” of AI. That said, the program revealed how hedge funds are now looking into AI to “get ahead of the markets”, where their use of AI will ultimately help them improve decision-making in the field. Companies like OpenAI and Anthropic, which have raised significant capital along the way, ultimately need enterprise clients to scale, and Wall Street is an ideal fit due to its reliance on data and analysis. Intelligent Alpha has launched a first-of-its-kind ETF named after famed stock trader Jesse Livermore. The ETF uses OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Anthropic’s Claude, and Google’s Gemini to construct a global equity portfolio. As per Clinton, firms that get on board with AI could gain an edge with a price tag of millions of dollars. “What it does is it adds some intelligence to indexes, which are just definitionally sort of a set of rules that can’t be smart. And they also take that emotion out of the active side where human beings are still making decisions, but we get caught up. You know, we make mistakes and sometimes those compound. And so I think by fixing those two issues, AI has the potential to really capture a lot of value in terms of assets flowing to these new AI-powered funds.” - Intelligent Alpha CEO Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Unsexy AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Methodology For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Databricks will be using Amazon’s Trainium AI chips for powering the training and serving of their large language models, providing joint customers with unmatched scale, performance, and cost-efficiency for their generative AI applications.

Strengthening our collaboration with AWS allows us to provide customers with unmatched scale and price-performance so they can bring their own generative AI applications to market more rapidly”. -Ali Ghodsi, Co-founder and CEO at Databricks. Overall, AMZN ranks 1st among the 15 AI News Investors Should Not Miss. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61 Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) is an American multinational digital communications technology conglomerate corporation offering a vast portfolio of technology innovations. The company has integrated AI-powered capabilities across many of its products, introduced a $1 billion fund earlier this year to invest in AI startups, and even maintains a strong foothold in cybersecurity, offering AI-powered security tools, and much more. On Wednesday, October 16, Citigroup analysts upgraded the stock to “Buy” from “Neutral” and raised the price target to $62 from $52 per share. This reflects an estimated 15% upside from Tuesday’s close. According to Citi analysts, investors shouldn’t overlook the artificial intelligence potential of Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO). The upgrade in the networking company’s shares by analyst Atif Malik highlights a narrowing valuation gap relative to peers, as well as a rapidly expanding AI Ethernet total addressable market that is projected to reach $10 billion by 2025. “While AI is currently a small piece of the biz (~2% of revs), we see the potential for a stronger contribution,” he wrote. “With more AI coming, we are incrementally more constructive on the group and expect continued investor rotation out of semis/hardware into networking equipment to benefit group valuation.” Furthermore, the addition of the company’s products in Meta Platforms’ AI hardware comes as a “positive validation of CSCO’s technology.” With at least three major hyperscalers already using its tools in their backend networks, Malik believes that the company’s $9 billion 2027 hyperscaler AI opportunity forecast may be “potentially understated”. The analyst has also increased his earnings per share estimates for 2025 and 2026 by 2% and 5%, respectively. “We believe shares warrant a sizable discount to networking peer valuation to reflect lingering share loss concerns, somewhat tempered by growing AI opportunities. Even at a 30+% discounted target multiple to peer average, we see meaningful upside to shares”. Overall CSCO ranks 8th on our list of AI news investors shouldn't miss.

BlackRock spot Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, accumulated about 5,805 BTC tokens within 24 hours, with its inflows exceeding $393 million. Following BlackRock’s IBIT’s impressive performance, the US spot Bitcoin ETFs have hit net inflows of over 20 billion since their launch. Meanwhile, Quantity Funds launched its STKD Bitcoin and Gold ETF, BTGD, due to the increasing demand for these assets. BlackRock spot Bitcoin ETF IBIT has recorded a new milestone: It accumulated 5,805 BTC, with about $393.4 million in net inflows. This feat demonstrates IBIT’s dominance in the ETF market. IBIT now leads the market by 50% in value to its immediate follow-up fund, Fidelity’s FBTC, which has $10.24 billion in net inflows. IBIT has amassed over $22.49 billion in net inflows since its debut, according to data from Farside Investors. Also, Wednesday proved to be a fruitful day as most Bitcoin ETFs posted impressive positive flows. The spot BTC ETFs scooped about $458.5 million in net inflows, and no ETF posted negative net flows for the day. Fidelity’s FBTC closed the day with net inflows of $14.8 million, while Bitwise’s BITB recorded $12.9 million in net inflows.

On Wednesday, the daily trading volume of all the spot Bitcoin ETFs amounted to $1.58 billion, a 48.1% decrease from the previous day’s trade volume of $3.05 billion. Following the impressive trading day on Wednesday, the spot BTC ETFs have net inflows of $20.19 billion since their launch. The ETF market has recorded increasing demand for Bitcoin and Gold ETFs. This trend prompted the emergence of the STKD Bitcoin & Gold ETF, a fund that offers exposure to both. Quantity Funds partnered with Return Stacked to launch STKD Bitcoin & Gold ETF. According to the announcement, STKD offers protection against inflation and currency debasement. Further, Quantity Funds revealed that its Bitcoin & Gold ETF will trade with the ticker BTGD. The ETF will expose investors to BTC and Gold via BTC futures, gold futures, and their related ETFs. Moreover, retail investors will gain 100% exposure to the ETF’s joint Bitcoin and Gold strategy for each $1 invested. The firm stated: “The bitcoin strategy seeks to capture the price return of bitcoin, investing in BTC futures and ETPs, while the gold strategy similarly seeks to capture the price return of gold via investments in gold futures and gold ETPs.” Your email address will not be published.

U.Today - Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, briefly reached highs of $69,000 before retreating. In Friday's trading session, the largest cryptocurrency reached a high of $69,000, its highest level since July 29, when Bitcoin last traded at $70,000. At the time of writing, BTC was up 0.17% in the last 24 hours to $68,277 and up 9% weekly. Bitcoin's (BTC) ongoing price comeback might have prompted global investors to seek exposure to exchange-traded products (ETPs) linked to the leading cryptocurrency as seen in a remarkable increase in inflows. In particular, U.S.-listed spot ETFs have seen a strong uptake, pulling in $2 billion in investor money in the week just concluded, according to Arkham Intelligence. In a major milestone, On Oct. 18, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) authorized applications from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) to list the much-awaited options for spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This is the largest ETF week since March, indicating a revived interest and confidence in Bitcoin among institutional investors. Bitcoin ETFs were initially approved in the United States in January. The top contributors to this large inflow include BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), Fidelity, ARK Invest and Bitwise. BlackRock led the push in Bitcoin acquisitions, adding a staggering $1.14 billion to its holdings. Other significant players in the ETF space also ramped up their Bitcoin acquisitions: Fidelity boosted its holdings by $319 million; ARK Invest added $306 million while Bitwise increased its Bitcoin portfolio by $150 million. Bitcoin reached an all-time high of $73,797 in March after soaring for weeks amid optimism on demand for Bitcoin ETFs. The price then fell by more than 30% by early August, before commencing on the present bull market run. This article was originally published on U.Today

Title: How Will Bitcoin ETF Options Impact Bitcoin’s Price?

Samara Cohen, Chief Investment Officer of ETF and Index Investments at Blackrock, walks in Times ... [+] Square after ringing the opening bell as Bitcoin Spot ETF's are launched on the Nasdaq Exchange. (Photo by Stephanie Keith/Getty Images) Last month, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) granted approval to Nasdaq ISE to list and trade options on Blackrock’s iShares Bitcoin Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), marking a significant step toward bringing regulated bitcoin options to the U.S. market. Although most retail investors who own bitcoin will not utilize this financial instrument, its availability in the U.S. may impact the adoption, liquidity, and volatility of bitcoin. This development promises to further ingrain bitcoin into the global financial system and support continued growth of the bitcoin network – and will forever change the way bitcoin is utilized as a part of an overall investment portfolio. Similar financial instruments have been available for a while, but until now they have only available on platforms outside the U.S., like Deribit. However, the approval from the SEC for IBIT options means that investors in the U.S. will have access to these contracts within a regulated framework. The U.S. has long been considered the leader in global finance, boasting the largest and most liquid equity and debt markets, with a wide range of financial instruments and a diverse investor base. By approving bitcoin ETF options in these markets, regulators will allow bitcoin investors unprecedented access to robust financial tools to manage risk and exposure. And, as institutional players like hedge funds and pension funds begin using bitcoin options, liquidity in the market will naturally increase, making it easier for large-scale trades to occur without destabilizing the asset’s price. Bitcoin options are contracts that give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell bitcoin at a predetermined price within a certain time frame. For institutional investors, these options provide a means to hedge against price volatility or to speculate on market movements without needing to hold the underlying asset. With options trading, investors can now hedge their bitcoin exposure more effectively or amplify potential returns through leverage. This flexibility may attract a wider variety of participants, offering new ways to approach bitcoin price exposure without directly buying the asset itself. In the future, regulated bitcoin options in the U.S. may lead to significant growth in its synthetic notional value, which refers to the total value of outstanding derivative contracts in the market. As options trading expands, the notional value tied to bitcoin could increase substantially, without requiring physical bitcoin to be bought or sold. This opens up a new avenue for market engagement while amplifying bitcoin’s influence in the global economy. IBIT options will be subject to existing ETF option trading rules, including criteria around listing, margin requirements, and trading halts, ensuring they integrate seamlessly into the broader financial system. The approved rule includes strict position and exercise limits, capping positions at 25,000 contracts. This limit is notably conservative compared to other ETFs – some of which have limits as high as 250,000 contracts – and was designed to minimize the risk of market manipulation. Additionally, the SEC and Nasdaq ISE have implemented robust surveillance and reporting mechanisms, ensuring that trades are carefully monitored for any signs of fraud or manipulation. The regulatory framework also includes access to surveillance from the CME’s bitcoin futures market, providing real-time oversight that tracks both the futures and spot markets, which are highly correlated. These options will be physically settled and follow the American-style exercise method, meaning they can be exercised at any point before their expiration. Bitcoin options offer a sophisticated way to manage risk and hedge exposure to its volatility. A common hedging strategy involves purchasing put options, which give you the right to sell bitcoin at a predetermined price (the strike price) within a specific time frame. This allows you to protect against a potential decline in bitcoin’s price. For example, if you hold a significant amount of bitcoin and grow concerned about a short-term price drop, you could buy a put option. If bitcoin's price falls below the strike price, the put option can be exercised, letting you sell the bitcoin at the higher strike price and limiting your losses. On the other hand, call options are used to hedge missed opportunities or upside potential. By buying a call option, you secure the right to buy bitcoin at a specified price if its market value rises, allowing you to participate in gains without fully exposing yourself to the asset’s volatility upfront. Both of these strategies allow you to manage your bitcoin positions more precisely, without being forced to sell the underlying asset in a downturn or miss out on potential profits during upward trends. Improved liquidity resulting from the introduction of bitcoin ETF options will have an effect on the volatility of its price. When a market has higher liquidity, larger trades can occur without significantly affecting the price of the asset. This is because more liquidity means there are more buyers and sellers available at any given time, which dampens the effect of any single transaction on the overall market. In the context of bitcoin, options provide institutional investors with tools to hedge their positions or take on exposure in a controlled manner, leading to more frequent but less disruptive trading activity. Additionally, the presence of options increases the number of market participants, each utilizing different strategies, from hedging to speculation, which adds layers of complexity to price discovery. As a result, liquidity is more evenly distributed across the market, reducing sharp price swings driven by low-volume trades. The SEC’s approval of bitcoin ETF options is a signal that bitcoin is gaining traction within the regulated financial system. As institutions gain more access to regulated financial products that include bitcoin, it will continue to mature and integrate into the financial system. With institutional adoption ramping up, the path forward for bitcoin looks bright. As more funds and institutional players enter the options market, bitcoin’s liquidity and market stability will likely improve, making it a more attractive asset for conservative investors. This will amplify the influx of institutional capital, further smoothing out bitcoin’s historically wild price swings, encouraging even greater participation.

Title: Cork SHC Final: Imokilly’s final-quarter blitz ends Sarsfields stay as champions

There was a brief yahoo from the stands at the final whistle, but no pitch invasion or dam burst of emotion. Imokilly, a powerful divisional team composed of junior and intermediate players from east Cork, have many admirers but not many invested followers. With a clinical second-half performance they won their sixth county title, dethroning last year’s winners Sars, and dominating the final just as they had lorded the knock-out phase of the championship in recent weeks. Playing with the gale, Imokilly rattled off 10 points without reply in the final quarter, crushing what remained of Sars’ resistance. The defending champions led by just six points at half-time, and even if it was impossible to estimate how much the gale was worth, six points felt like a cocktail umbrella in a storm. In the event they were on the sharp end of a 15-point swing. As a divisional team Imokilly cannot represent Cork in the Munster club championship, and in recent weeks a debate about the continued desirability of divisional teams in the Cork championship has surfaced again. At the moment Imokilly are incredibly powerful with an array of players with intercounty pedigree, past and present. Ciarán Joyce, Cork’s brilliant centre back, was imperious in the Imokilly half-back line. Séamus Harnedy, who had a resurgent season with Cork, thundered into the game in the second half. Elsewhere on the field were Bill Cooper, Brian Lawton and John Cronin, all of whom had played senior championship for Cork. The heart and lungs of the team, though, are seven or eight young players who had won Under-20 All-Irelands with Cork in recent years. Among them was the man of the match, Jack Leahy, who was terrific in the corner and racked up 11 points, three from play. Outside him, Diarmuid Leahy is an emerging player who will surely play for Cork in the National League in the new year. For a divisional team, though, the unity in the group is undeniable. “People are saying all year, ye’re only a division,” said Joyce afterwards, “but literally, tonight, when we’re going out we’re like a club, we all get on very well. Even at half-time we were only saying to ourselves how great we get on. It showed in the second half there, we were fighting for every ball like we’re a club.” In the end, Sars couldn’t hold back the tide. Their half-time lead was wiped out 10 minutes into the second half, and they did exceptionally well to still be level 10 minutes later. Imokilly’s goal, though, three minutes into the second half, changed the tone of the game. Daniel Kearney was dispossessed by Cooper, 30 yards from his own goal, and with no covering defenders in his path, Adam Murphy had an unimpeded run. His finish was high and fierce. Overall, the conditions were a menace. A gale blew towards the Blackrock end, extending the scoring zone to about 100 metres. Eoin Davis, the Imokilly goalkeeper, had a wide from a puck-out in the second half, and shortly afterwards landed a free from just outside the D. The uprights at both ends swayed like backing singers. There must have been a strong case for postponement, but that decision would have been complicated by the significant number of Imokilly players still involved in unfinished championships with their clubs. One of the original selling points for the split season was that the latter stages of county championships would be played out in kinder weather, but October has turned into a treacherous month, and county finals all over the country are routinely stalked by the colour card of weather warnings now. Sars played with the elements in the first half, but they struggled to get into a rhythm with their shooting and reached half-time with more wides, 12, than points, 11. Conor O’Sullivan and Paul Leopold, their two corner backs, both scored without having to stray far from home. Sars had eight different scorers in the first half, but they failed to threaten a goal when they really needed something to give an adrenaline shot to their scoring rate. Having won the toss Imokilly decided to play against the gale in the first half, and trailing by just 0-11 to 0-5 at the break, that gambit had paid off. “It was fairly manageable with that wind,” said Joyce. “Obviously we knew the quality we had in the dressingroom. We’re star-studded at the moment so we knew we’d get over the line. It’s all about confidence, these type of games.” Sars failed to score for 13 minutes in the final quarter, and in that time Imokilly put the game to bed. Shane Hegarty scored twice inside a minute to give Imokilly the lead for just the second time with 10 minutes left and from there they took flight.

Title: Bitcoin Dominance Overshadows Several Important Crypto Trends
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/10/20/bitcoin-dominance-overshadows-several-important-crypto-trends/
Time Published: 2024-10-20T17:45:44Z

Bitcoin's market dominance is at the highest levels in years Bitcoin continues to march toward all-time-highs that were only reached earlier in 2024, although the volatility that the token has experienced in the run-up to the U.S. Presidential election has been elevated when compared to prior periods in the year. Regardless of the volatile rise, the fact remains that the price of bitcoin and bitcoin interest continues to move in positive directions in spite of short-term setbacks. Alongside the growing interest and investment into the crypto sector by both major political parties the crypto sector has experienced an upswing in price, trading volume, and investor sentiment. As has occurred during previous bull markets, a rising tide in the crypto sector at large has led to a re-establishment of bitcoin dominance and leadership. Specifically, the share of total market capitalization captured by bitcoin, used to determine the dominance of bitcoin has risen to approximately 60% as of October 2024 which is the highest level since April of 2022. Following the declines in crypto prices overall in 2022 – and bottoming out with the collapse of FTX in November 2022, the market share of bitcoin has continued to steadily increase since those events. In addition to the market capitalization aspect of market leadership it is worth pointing out that the institutional inflows and interest coming into crypto have continued to be centered around bitcoin. For example, while both bitcoin and ether have spot ETFs products at this point, the bitcoin ETFs have attracted $18.9 billion while ether ETFs have attracted a substantially lower amount. Given all of that investors might be surprised to learn about several other major developments in the crypto sector. Let’s take a look at a few of the headlines that market watchers might have overlooked. With the rising price of bitcoin, the steady inflows into spot bitcoin ETFs, and the fact that legislation has been put forward advocating for a strategic bitcoin reserve it would be relatively straightforward for investors and policymakers to relegate stablecoins to the back burner. Doing so, however, would be ignoring a slice of the cryptoasset sector that continues to not only grow in market capitalization, but also would ignore a potential on-ramp for millions of new crypto users. USDT and USDC continue to dominate the stablecoin sector, with the former retaining its position as the largest and most commonly used stablecoin and the latter continuing to rank among the most trusted cryptoasset by the TradFi community. Despite doubts connected to business models, the ability to the issuing institutions to weather higher interest rates, and the looming potential of a CBDC stablecoins continue to represent the crypto of choice for users seeking to utilize crypto as a medium of exchange, as on on-ramp to crypto for non-expert investors, and as the crypto of choice for TradFi institutions looking for exposure in the crypto space. These facts exclude the reality that PayPal, a payment processor with household name recognition in the U.S. and abroad, has launched a stablecoin and is allowing individuals and merchants to buy, sell, and hold cryptoassets, including PYUSD. Spot crypto ETFs were a goal that crypto advocates, investors, and entrepreneurs and the approval of both bitcoin and ether ETFs in the same calendar year was – justifiably so – seen as a major victory for the crypto sector. That said, bitcoin spot ETFs introduce several tax considerations unique to cryptocurrency and its classification by tax authorities. With a Bitcoin spot ETF, investors may face capital gains taxes when they sell shares, similar to other ETFs. However, since the ETF holds actual Bitcoin, additional complexity arises regarding cost basis tracking for the fund's transactions, specifically as the coming changes to the IRS code make crypto tax reporting and compliance both more complicated and costly. Another challenge is the taxation of in-kind redemptions, where Bitcoin might be delivered directly to investors, triggering taxable events. Moreover, the frequent fluctuations in Bitcoin prices can lead to short-term capital gains, which are taxed at higher rates than long-term gains. In addition, investors should take into account the implications of international tax laws if the ETF is traded abroad, as crypto regulations and tax treatments vary by country. One of the most under-discussed trends of the recent crypto bull market has been how the centralization of crypto, and bitcoin specifically, has continued unabated and how it has accelerated in many cases. Even as the announcements and launches of bitcoin related or even bitcoin adjacent products and services propel the price per token to higher levels, the reality is the supply of bitcoin, bitcoin sentiment, and the crypto market overall continue to become centralized. Punctuating this reality are the actions taken by nation states such as El Salvador and Bhutan, which are both accumulating strategic reserves of bitcoin, the moves by global financial services leaders such as Blackrock and Fidelity into the bitcoin space, and the appetite that bitcoin tradeable products has fulfilled for investors. Centralization was always going to be a component of mass market adoption, but proponents of nation-state strategies for bitcoin should be wary of undermining one of the core tenets and appeals of the asset. Bitcoin has reestablished itself as the leading cryptoasset, but these dominance levels can overshadow important trends for crypto investors. One Community. Many Voices.

And then there were none. The last unbeaten record in Division 1A of the Energia AIL ended when Clontarf were beaten 28-10 at Castle Avenue by a dominant Terenure. In another meeting between the big four of the last few seasons, Lansdowne beat champions Cork Con 27-10. Harrison Brewer, Adam Melia and Jordan Coughlan, as usual, revelling on home turf, were at their best as Terenure roared into an 18-0 lead thanks to tries by Henry McErlean and Chris Cosgrave before coughing up an intercept try. Winger Craig Adams finished a superb strike move from a scrum on their own 22 instigated by the footwork and offload of Leinster’s Austrian academy out-half Casper Gabriel and another try-scoring assist by Adam La Grue. The visitors were disappointed not to add a bonus point try in the last half-hour, meaning Clontarf stayed top by a point. A feature of the day was the contributions of so many players returning from the Emerging Ireland tour, for example, the Charlie Tector show at the Aviva backpitch. Although reinventing himself as a centre with Leinster, the ex-Ireland under-20 outhalf enjoyed his return to 10, scoring 22 points with two tries and five kicks from five. Yet Leinster scrumhalf Cormac Foley was man of the match for the way he controlled the match. Captain Jack Cooke also scored as they roared into a 17-3 interval lead and as their excellent defence kept Con at arm’s length they were also a little disappointed not to register a bonus point. The other three games were all decided by kicks in the last minute. Conor Rankin held his nerve to convert a second maul try by Clayton Mulligan to seal Ballynahinch’s 26-25 win away to Young Munster while the St Mary’s centre Mick O’Gara and UCD outhalf and captain James Tarrant earned 25-22 wins at home to Garryowen and away to City of Armagh. The top-of-the-table 1B clash enabled Old Belvedere to move top with a 32-31 win at newly promoted Nenagh Ormond. Corinthians’ amalgam of recent and prospective under-20 internationals were at their free-flowing best as they, Cashel and Instonians maintained their perfect records in 2A. Orin Burke finished off two of Corinthians’ four first-half tries after flurries of offloads and sidestepping before 6ft 10in lock Bryan Walsh beat five defenders in a barnstorming 35-minute charge to score their sixth of seven. Next Saturday Corinthians host Instonians, who have won 38 of their last 40 AIL matches, one of the two exceptions being in Corinthian Park last season.

Title: Report: Donald Trump Puts Migration First in Final Days of 2024 Campaign
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/2024-election/2024/10/20/donald-trump-leads-with-migration-in-final-days-of-2024-campaign/

Full Content:
Donald Trump is taking a political risk by centering migration — not the nation’s economy — in his two-week dash to the ballot box, says the New York Times. “In the final weeks of a campaign …. Mr. Trump is going with his gut, doubling down on the rhetoric that he believes won him the 2016 election and using immigration and the border to form the core of his closing message to voters,” the newspaper reported October 19. Migration ‘“beats out the economy” with voters, Donald Trump told his October 15 rally, the newspaper said. “It’s not even close.” Immigration and the economy are wrapped together, Trump’s campaign told the newspaper: Asked to explain Mr. Trump’s focus in the closing days of the race, a Trump spokesman, Brian Hughes, said: “President Trump rightfully recognizes that Kamala Harris’s porous border is at the heart of so many issues, whether it is high housing prices, low wages or overwhelmed hospitals and schools. An open border means that taxpayer dollars are wasted on illegal immigrants, instead of benefiting citizens. President Trump’s closing message is all about putting Americans first and restoring prosperity.” The Times reporters did not mention that Kamala Harris’ 2024 economic platform requires a huge inflow of migrants. A Democratic-leaning advocacy group, for example, predicted she will import 12.3 million migrants during the next four years. Amazingly, Harris has not tried to revive her campaign with a promise to reduce the inflow of economic migrants, despite her promising to upgrade border security many times. RELATED — CNN’s Zakaria: Biden Should Go Back to Trump’s Immigration Policies A growing number of GOP leaders — including Trump’s pick for Vice President, JD Vance — recognize that the federal migration policy imposes huge pocketbook and civic costs on ordinary Americans. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), for example, wrote an October 17 article for CompactMag.com, showing that migration has damaged ordinary Americans: … immigration remained within sustainable limits through most of the 1970s and ’80s, and it remained within most Americans’ grasp to make ends meet. My own parents, themselves immigrants from Cuba, earned enough to buy a home and raise four children on the salaries of a hotel bartender and stay-at-home mom who occasionally worked as a maid. As recently as 1985, meanwhile, the average US-born man could afford a middle-class lifestyle for a family of four on about 40 weeks of wages (compared with about 62 weeks today). In other words, the American Dream was alive and well, for immigrants and natives alike. But Washington, DC, changed the rules for ordinary Americans by supercharging global trade and migration, Rubio wrote: The consequences of this for US-born men have been catastrophic. The percentage of prime-age men now working or looking for work is close to what it was in 1940, in the throes of the Great Depression. Meanwhile, one economist estimates that by 2016, immigrants had “increased the size of the low-skilled workforce by roughly 25 percent.” The Biden-Harris administration has only compounded the problem. By one government count, the administration has admitted at least 6.5 million more illegal migrants since then—and that doesn’t include an estimated 1.5 million “gotaways.” Some Wall Street investors are touting an alternative, low-migration strategy that would expand economic growth and prosperity. “I can argue, in the developed countries, the big winners are the countries that have shrinking populations,” BlackRock founder Larry Fink said at a pro-globalist event hosted by the World Economic Forum in Saudi Arabia. He continued: That’s something that most people never talked about. We always used to think [a] shrinking population is a cause for negative [economic] growth. But in my conversations with the leadership of these large, developed countries [such as China, and Japan] that have xenophobic anti-immigration policies, they don’t allow anybody to come in — [so they have] shrinking demographics — these countries will rapidly develop robotics and AI and technology … If a promise of all that transforms productivity, which most of us think it will [emphasis added] — we’ll be able to elevate the standard living in countries, the standard of living for individuals, even with shrinking populations. In contrast, countries with expanding populations need to focus on basic issues of education and the “rule of law,” said Fink, adding: So for those countries that have rising populations, the answer will be education … [and] for those countries that do not have a foundation of rule of law, or education, that’s where the [economic] divide is going to get more and more extreme. Breitbart News has closely c0vered the federal government’s post-1990 use of migration to boost the U.S. consumer economy by extracting cheap workers, government-aided consumers, and apartment-sharing renters from poor countries. Extraction Migration Since at least 1990, the federal government has quietly adopted a policy of Extraction Migration to grow the consumer economy after Congress voted to help investors move the high-wage manufacturing sector to lower-wage countries. The migration policy extracts vast amounts of human resources from needy countries. The additional workers, white-collar graduates, consumers, and renters push up stock values by shrinking Americans’ wages, subsidizing low-productivity companies, boosting rents, and spiking real estate prices. The little-recognized economic policy has loosened the economic and civic feedback signals that animate a stable economy and democracy. It has pushed many native-born Americans out of careers in a wide variety of business sectors, reduced Americans’ productivity and political clout, slowed high-tech innovation, shrunk trade, crippled civic solidarity, and incentivized government officials and progressives to ignore the rising death rate of discarded, low-status Americans. Donald Trump’s campaign team recognizes the economic impact of migration. Biden’s unpopular policy is “flooding America’s labor pool with millions of low-wage illegal migrants who are directly attacking the wages and opportunities of hard-working Americans,” said a May statement from Trump’s campaign. The secretive economic policy also sucks jobs and wealth from heartland states by subsidizing coastal investors and government agencies with a flood of low-wage workers, high-occupancy renters, and government-aided consumers. Similar policies have damaged citizens and economies in Canada and the United Kingdom. The colonialism-like policy has also damaged small nations and has killed hundreds of Americans and thousands of migrants, including many on the taxpayer-funded jungle trail through the Darien Gap in Panama.

Title: Data centers and Crypto: Adapting for the future

Transitioning to spine-leaf architecture ensures blockchain networks maintain reliability and security, surpassing traditional data center designs. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The following is a guest post from Shane Neagle, Editor In Chief from The Tokenist. The steady Bitcoin trickle into the mainstream consciousness since 2009 mainnet launch had many cascading effects. First, it served as a revelatory vehicle by exemplifying the nature of money; why it should be outside of central banking, and why fixed supply is important for the valuation of money. Second, Bitcoin sparked an entire crypto industry, further making the case for decentralized financial services that eliminate gatekeepers in favor of smart contracts enforced by blockchain networks. As this $2.2 trillion sector develops, banks are further poised to lose their role as trusted intermediaries. Third, data center infrastructure is becoming more important than ever. Whether home-based or as large mining operations, crypto infrastructure needs reliable high-performance computing resources, storage capacity and memory alongside fast networking to maximally reduce blockchain latency. In fact, data centers are so critical that an entire knowledge field emerged to balance power requirements, cooling solutions, server density and crypto hosting location. When these factors come together, crypto needs to forge an indelible mark on the data center design itself. Let’s explore how. In the early days of the internet, broadband connection was rare. This necessitated local resources within businesses and institutions to be used for data storage and management. By the end of 2000s, broadband infrastructure had become sufficiently ubiquitous to start supporting cloud computing. In other words, data centers were being delocalized into remote, scalable, on-demand server clusters. The ability to eliminate on-premise infrastructure and host data and apps remotely drastically cut upfront capital expenditure. Of course, this ultimately benefited Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud as the data center triumvirate that powers the bulk of today’s digital landscape. However, securing blockchain networks exerts an entirely new load layer. Because these digital ledgers facilitate real-time transaction processing, between multiple nodes to verify them, extra CPU, GPU power and RAM is needed to minimize congestion and latency. And if there is a sudden spike in blockchain network traffic, this too requires resource redundancy. This is why both AI and blockchain-oriented data centers have been transitioning from traditional client-to-server architecture (north to south) to spine-and leaf architecture (east to west). The spine-leaf approach makes for a non-hierarchical design that allows data to flow horizontally between servers. This is critical for blockchain networks, as each node directly communicates with other nodes without having to go through a congestible central point. Therefore, a spine-leaf architecture alleviates bottleneck and single point failure potential. Because this mirrors the spirit of crypto decentralization and peer-to-peer (P2P) communication, spine-leaf data centers have become the new standard for blockchain reliability and security. As blockchain networks need greater compute power to validate transactions and execute smart contracts, so is there greater need for energy consumption. By 2022, blockchain networks have already carved a significant proportion of data center electricity demand. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the data sector servicing the crypto industry globally consumed 460 TWh in 2022, which is forecasted to more than double by 2026. For comparison, France consumed 447 TWh annually in 2021. These trends clearly point to a reliable source of power, which is why Microsoft saw fit to make a 20-year deal with Constellation Energy to restart Unit 1 nuclear reactor in 2028. In Europe, the European Commission even designated Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) as “green” to balance decarbonisation efforts with increased electricity demand. But raw power capacity is only the beginning of scaling. To make crypto-oriented data centers more efficient, they are moving closer to power plants. This is best exemplified by Bitcoin. The primary cryptocurrency uses a proof-of-work algorithm to secure the network, effectively anchoring Bitcoin in the physical world of energy and hardware assets. This is what ultimately gives Bitcoin its value as decentralized money and global transfer of wealth. In essence, Bitcoin represents digital energy. But because power is lost over long distance electrical transmission, due to copper/aluminum resistance, it would be wasteful to erect crypto data centers just anywhere. Rather, they should be as close to power plants as possible to minimize transmission loss. Case in point, the New York state power plant bypasses state level network by directly plugging in thousands of servers. Likewise, Ward Roddam, mayor of Rockdale, Texas, recently made the case that Bitcoin mining can revitalize communities by investing to siphon excess energy and stabilize the electric grid with flexible load demand. “Riot Platforms is building a state-of-the-art facility in Corsicana, which will be one of Navarro County’s largest employers. The mine could bring $1.4 billion in taxable purchases and over $115 million in wages over the next decade.“ Another crypto mining company, TeraWulf, has been building its Nautilus Cryptomine adjacent to the Susquehanna nuclear power plant, now in the hands of Talen Energy. This will be the first zero-carbon, nuclear-powered Bitcoin mining facility. With a 200 MW capacity, this would be the equivalent to ~160,000 US households’ energy consumption annually. In addition to spatial proximity to reduce transmission loss, data centers servicing blockchain networks need particular mechanical, electrical and plumbing (MEP) requirements. As every PC owner knows, the source of such requirements at large scale comes from heat management. Continuous solving of cryptography puzzles requires great computing power which generates heat. For many years, air cooling has been the go-to solution to prolong hardware longevity and dissipate heat. Unfortunately, cooling also draws significant energy on top of computing itself. This is why there is a new trend to rely more on direct-to-chip liquid cooling (immersion cooling) which cuts down on power usage. ₿𝗥𝗘𝗔𝗞𝗜𝗡𝗚: 33,000 new immersion-cooled #bitcoin mining computers connect online today. This 100 megawatt facility is now the largest electricity user in Sadersville, Georgia. pic.twitter.com/5TzqF9f3IT — Documenting ₿itcoin 📄 (@DocumentingBTC) February 13, 2024 But even so, these types of data centers need advanced HVAC control systems and capacity to handle thermal loads. Equally so, high-power-density clusters, at 20 – 40 kW per rack, require larger power transformers, backup systems and high-capacity power distribution units (PDUs). For example, Crypto Minotaur PDU can handle up to 92.4kW worth of power density. Lastly, to ensure continuous blockchain workloads, such data centers typically rely on backup redundancy via natural gas or diesel power generators coupled with automatic transfer switches (ATS). Those familiar with the inner workings of Bitcoin code know that its security is derived from the concept of Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT). In short, even if multiple network nodes fail, the consensus on the current state of the ledger is still achieved. In data center design, this means that blockchain miners have to account for redundancy tiers according to the Uptime Institute: Of course, as each tier increases redundancy, so does it increases the cost. Large companies with deep pockets can afford such scaling and then attract smaller businesses into their cloud computing ecosystems. Case in point, Microsoft Azure’s data center infrastructure is certified as ISO/IEC 27001:2013 and NIST SP 800-53 for network security and reliability, which is the prerequisite to achieve Tier IV level of fault tolerance. However, such redundancy is not strictly necessary for Bitcoin needs, as other nodes around the globe can take up the slack. Bitcoin’s 10-minute block confirmation interval was intentionally picked by Satoshi Nakamoto to inject inherent redundancy in the network. Nonetheless, this may not apply to blockchain networks like Solana (SOL) or Avalanche (AVAX) with near-instant settlements that aim to supplant Visa-like money transfer systems. For activities like day trading, they would require maximum uptime provided by Tier IV data centers. To that end, Solana Foundation formed the Solana Server Program. Its flexible month-to-month contracts rely on data center providers like Edgevana. Ethereum and Avalanche typically use AWS, Google Cloud and Tencent Cloud for the bulk of their server needs. After the 4th Bitcoin halving in April, miners’ rewards were cut in half, from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC. At the same time, Bitcoin network difficulty increased from 86.3886 T to present 88.4044 T. It is further estimated that the next Bitcoin difficulty adjustment will increase by 3.81% on October 9th. This translates to fewer payments for the same amount of computational exertion and energy consumption. Yet, this would exert a negative impact, to the point of bankruptcy, only if Bitcoin price were to fall under $40k, according to CoinShares’ report. Taking into account the spectrum of initial capital expenditures, this translates to different cost runways for different mining companies. Analyze the return on investment for crypto mining operations, particularly in light of recent reductions in Bitcoin mining rewards. Consider the potential for additional revenue streams, such as converting facilities for heat reuse. But with major selling pressures out of the way, in particular from the German government and Mt. Gox payments, it is more likely that BTC price will go up rather than drop. Historically, BTC price achieves a new all-time high within ~18 months following the halving event. Moreso, the USG’s uncontrollable spending is likely to further cement Bitcoin’s case for sound money as the dollar’s value continues to gradually erode. Lastly, Bitcoin mining efficiency continues to improve, as noted by aforementioned cooling immersion and upgrades to newer ASIC machines such as Antminer S21. For an electric grid to remain stable (and usable) it has to balance periods of high and low demand. The Bitcoin network is ideally suited for this task as Bitcoin miners can adjust usage on the fly. After Texas legislatures passed House Bill 591, Bitcoin data centers have a further role to play in energy sustainability. The bill allows oil and gas operators to sell vented/flared gas to on-site mobile data centers. This gas would otherwise be wasted as a byproduct of extraction.

Title: Ciarán Frawley’s availability for Ireland’s clash with All Blacks in doubt
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2024/10/20/ciaran-frawleys-availability-for-irelands-clash-with-all-blacks-in-doubt/

Leinster are expected to give an update on the injury which forced Ciarán Frawley in the 17th minute of their 33-12 win over Connacht in the Sportsground in their weekly Monday bulletin. The Ireland international limped off gingerly after being tackled by David Hawkshaw in the build-up to Leinster’s second try by Liam Turner when his foot was momentarily trapped under the Connacht centre. “I don’t know, is it his foot or ankle. I’m not 100 per cent sure yet,” admitted Leo Cullen. “The two new caps were taking centre stage in the dressingroom, so we’ll find out and will know more on Monday,” added the Leinster head coach in reference to their two debutants, 20-year-old hooker Stephen Smyth and 21-year-old centre Hugh Cooney. Frawley was replaced by Ross Byrne, who steered Leinster to their fifth bonus point in five games to lead the BKT URC table by seven points, 10 points clear of Ulster, a dozen ahead of Connacht and 14 clear of Munster after their error-strewn 34-19 loss to the Stormers in Cape Town. Frawley was unlikely to feature next Saturday at the Aviva Stadium against the Lions, who sit in second place with the only other unbeaten record and a game in hand on Leinster, when Sam Prendergast is likely to return. But after his match-winning drop goals in Ireland’s last outing against the Springboks in Durban, Frawley’s anticipated presence in the Irish matchday squad against New Zealand in their opening Autumn Nations Series game at the Aviva Stadium on Friday, November 8th must be in doubt. “We’re delighted with the win,” said Cullen on a blustery night in Galway, after Leinster stormed into a 21-5 lead by half-time with three first-half tries and completed another bonus point within six minutes of the restart. “It’s bloody tough coming here. Conditions were tricky as well out there. I thought we started the game well again, that’s a few weeks in a row we’ve started the game well. “We got in for two good tries and probably had another couple of opportunities we didn’t take. Connacht came back into the game and had to play into the wind, it was very difficult to kick into the wind. “They got in for a good try and you’re thinking, ‘this is probably not going to be a big enough lead’. We did well to score on half-time, which gives us a bit of scoreboard separation. “We started the second half well and got in, but Connacht were challenging us the whole time. Then they eventually got in for a good try, and it was going to be a tight 15 minutes, and then Ross kicks off and then Andrew Osborne gobbles the ball out of the air and scores an incredible try, which probably just took the sting out of Connacht a little bit. “Overall, we’re delighted, with five academy players in the 23, two guys making their debuts. There’s lots of positives in that.” It’s already becoming hard to credit that Gus McCarthy is still one of the those five academy players. The 21-year-old hooker, who captained Blackrock College to the Leinster Schools Senior Cup and the Ireland Under-20s to a Six Nations title and World Cup final two seasons ago, was making his third start of the season for Leinster in addition to Emerging Ireland’s win over Western Force, after which he was called home to play the second half of last week’s win over Munster in Croke Park. This was in light of Rónan Kelleher joining long-term casualty Dan Sheahan on the casualty list after an ankle procedure which will sideline him for the New Zealand game and beyond. With the Ulster pair of Rob Herring and Tom Stewart yet to feature this season, the in-form Dave Heffernan looks favourite to start against the All Blacks but although it’s probably too early for McCarthy, who caught the eye at the Dexcom Stadium with three clean breaks, he is nonetheless putting himself in the conversation. “Yeah, he’s been fantastic, Gus,” said Cullen. “He had lots of big moments in the game today. I talked about him last week, we were talking about the hookers, the three guys we had during pre-season. “Stephen [Smyth] was away with the 20s, so it’s good to see him come off the bench today and make his debut which is fantastic. He’s definitely one for the future as well. “With Gus, he was fighting it out with John [McKee] and Lee [Barron] over the course of pre-season and he did well. He got a start in that first game against Edinburgh, had a quick trip to South Africa and played two games while we played one, and straight into Croke Park last week. “It’s been a fantastic first five rounds, which has included a trip to South Africa, a brilliant experience for him.” Gerry Thornley is Rugby Correspondent of The Irish Times Sign up to the Irish Times weekly rugby digest for the view from the press box with Gerry Thornley © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

The bitcoin price, which soared toward its all-time high of around $70,000 per bitcoin in recent weeks thanks to BlackRock and China, has stalled after Tesla's $750 million worth of bitcoin moved to new addresses following two years of dormancy, sparking speculation Tesla may have sold off its remaining bitcoin. Now, as billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller issues a serious Federal Reserve warning, Elon Musk has repeated a warning that the U.S. is hurtling toward the brink of "bankruptcy." Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run Tesla billionaire Elon Musk has repeatedly warned the U.S. is headed for "bankruptcy"—while the ... [+] bitcoin price has soared toward its all-time high of around $70,000 per bitcoin. "Excess government spending is driving America to bankruptcy," Musk posted to X, the social media platform he bought and rebranded from Twitter. Musk's post quoted an anonymous finance account that had said "$500 billion was added to the national debt in just the last 3 weeks," adding: "The government is out of control." Meanwhile, speaking during a town hall meeting in Folsom, Pennsylvania, Musk warned inflation could again spiral out of control as a result of "crazy" government spending. "The Federal government is spending America into bankruptcy ... and that's what really leads to inflation ... when the government spends more than it brings in," Musk said, calling it a "pernicious" tax. "We have to radically reduce the amount of government spending so we don't rack up a government debt that's impossible to repay and we don't drive the country to bankruptcy," Musk said. 10/20 update: Elon Musk has continued to warn that U.S. spending is spiraling out of control, posting to X that "this needs to stop." "The U.S. Treasury—your tax dollars—are being wasted at a staggering rate," Musk posted, quoting a post by a political action committee (PAC) founded by Musk that claimed "half a trillion dollars has been added to the National Debt in the past three weeks." "Wasteful spending is out of control in this country," the America PAC posted, adding "a Department of Government Efficiency is desperately needed." Musk has agreed to lead the so-called Department of Government Efficiency that has been suggested by former U.S. president and Republican candidate Donald Trump, calling it Doge—a reference to the meme that's also the basis of the dogecoin cryptocurrency. The dogecoin cryptocurrency, a tongue-in-cheek rival to bitcoin that's been semi-adopted by Musk over recent years, has seen its price soar 25% this last week on the back of Musk's Doge department comments—which caused billionaire Mark Cuban to joke that Musk could put "dogecoin in the U.S. Treasury," if Donald Trump retakes the White House next month. Last month, Musk met with El Salvador's bitcoin-backing president Nayib Bukele, who made history when he adopted bitcoin as legal tender in El Salvador in 2021, with Bukele predicting the U.S.'s days could be numbered. U.S. national debt has skyrocketed in recent years, crossing the $34 trillion mark at the beginning of 2024, largely due to Covid and lockdown stimulus measures that sent inflation spiraling out of control and forced the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates at a historical clip. Earlier this year, Bank of America analysts warned the U.S. debt load is about to ramp up to add $1 trillion every 100 days—potentially fueling a bitcoin price surge—and could reach $36 trillion by the end of 2024. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has returned to its all-time high this year, surging as the Federal Reserve gears ...

Gold and bitcoin could be boosted by "persistently high government deficits across major economies, to waning confidence in fiat currencies in certain emerging markets, and to a broader diversification away from the dollar," according to the analysts who said a Trump election win would likely reinforce the debasement trade. "Rising geopolitical tensions and the coming U.S. election are likely to reinforce what some investors call the 'debasement trade' thus favoring both gold and bitcoin," JPMorgan analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a note to clients seen by Marketwatch.

Sunday, 20 Oct 2024 KUALA LUMPUR: The right to speak and the freedom of our people must be preserved and defended, says Datuk Seri Dr Wee Ka Siong. "I'm puzzled, why today the government seems to be trying to restrict the people's freedom of speech, when before it was proclaimed that 'the voice of the people is the voice of God'," the MCA president said. Addressing a gathering that also included Barisan Nasional chairman Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, Dr Wee expressed concern over apparent attempts to restrict the people's freedom of expression. "In this hall (San Choon Hall), there are many whose videos have been taken down from social media, such as secretary-general Datuk Chong Sin Woon. "How many videos have been affected, deleted, removed?" he said at the 71st MCA annual general meeting held at Wisma MCA on Sunday (Oct 20). Deputy Communications Minister Teo Nie Ching had earlier stated that social media platforms independently remove content based on their assessments and user abuse reports, not just government requests via the Malaysian Communication and Multimedia Commission (MCMC). While the Government Takedown Request Report indicates TikTok received 1,862 requests from the Malaysian government, it also highlights that there were 6,231 total requests for content removal. Muar MP Syed Saddiq claimed that the government sought the removal of TikTok videos uploaded by former health minister Khairy Jamaluddin. These videos addressed the privatisation of Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd (MAHB) and mentioned American company BlackRock, which is purportedly linked to Israel. However, Communications Minister Fahmi Fadzil later clarified that neither his ministry nor the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) were involved in the removal of these videos.

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. MUMBAI : While parenthood is a very special feeling, it demands a lot of financial adjustments. However meticulously one plans, there are always surprises when one becomes a parent. Mint spoke to some young families to find out how they deal with the various costs associated with parenthood. The Google familyGoogle Llc employee Aman Narang and his wife Isha Aggarwal are parents to a 14-month-old son. While now in Gurugram, the couple was in Bengaluru during their son's birth. The couple had an interesting start to spending on baby care as their parents were based in North India (Delhi and Haryana). “Initially, for support, we used to fly down our parents to Bengaluru," Narang said. Credit card saves the dayCredit card points helped the family save money on these frequent and often last-minute flight bookings, as the couple didn’t have any close relatives in Bengaluru for support. “I used points on my Axis Magnus credit card to book 12-13 flight tickets during that initial period of five months. If not for the card, we would've spent close to ₹1 lakh on just getting our parents to fly down here. We shelled out just ₹15,000, charged as processing fees, on this unexpected expense," he said. “There were also some last-minute cancellations, but as these tickets were booked on points, a small point-based penalty was charged, but most of the points were credited back to the account," he added. Also Read: Diapers, doctors, schooling: know the costs of raising a child in India The domestic help cum nannyAfter their son turned five months old, the couple got external help. “We hired a domestic help cum nanny when we moved to Gurugram for a monthly salary of ₹20,000, who gives us 10-11 hours a day," Isha said. The couple moved to Gurugram to be close to their parents, Aman’s job offer and Isha's transfer to the company’s (BlackRock Inc.) head office. The baby car seatThe couple also tried to save by getting hand-me-downs from their friends and relatives. “I got a car seat from my sister-in-law as she is in the US and there it is mandatory to have a baby car seat. She gave most of the essentials that helped manage costs, e.g., booster seat, high chair, baby monitor, clothes, etc. We got a cot from another friend as a gift. Our families also ensured that they kept our preferences in mind while getting gifts for the baby because of which we could save a lot on essentials like a stroller, baby rocker, play gyms, developmental toys, etc.," Narang said. The couple follows an interesting practice when managing their household expenses. They have a separate joint bank account, which acts like their spending account. “Monthly spending for all non-savings items happens through this account," Narang said. The spending accountIn the run-up to the pregnancy, the couple had added a buffer to this spending account, expecting a higher outgo. “We added ₹15,000 every month into this account. However, this largely got used for the delivery costs, which exceeded the insurance cover, and the cord blood preservation, which was also quite expensive," he said. The employer benefitThe couple plans to put their son in daycare in the next few months. Here, Narang will benefit from his employer’s collaboration with daycare providers. “So, we should get discounts on the daycare costs," he said. The couple is planning a 5-6 hour daycare, which would otherwise cost ₹20,000 per month. However, the couple may need to pay only ₹5,000-6,000 per month. Also read: Opinion | Know the cost of raising a child to plan in advanceTotal first-year costThe couple’s monthly expenditure on clothes worked out to be ₹3,000, diapers ₹3,300, infant formula (5th to 11th month) ₹1,750 per month and nanny (from 5th month onwards) ₹20,000 per month, paediatrician visits ₹900 per month and vaccines ₹3,500 per two months during the first year. The couple spent a total of ₹3.17 lakh in the first year. Besides this, they celebrated their son's first birthday with a resort stay, costing ₹30,000 for the family. The traditional familyMumbai-based Mayank Doshi, technology manager at Bank of America, and his wife Pankita, associate manager at Accenture, saved on costs by sticking to cloth diapers, getting their baby vaccinated at government centres, and thanks to gifting traditions in their family. The couple spent ₹2.29 lakh in their first year as parents to a 13-month-old baby girl. Pocket-friendlyDoshi said he had been lucky with costs. “My daughter breastfed for 10 months. Then, we gradually introduced her to normal buffalo milk. So, we never had to give her any formula," he said. The couple also used cloth diapers largely instead of disposable diapers. These also helped save on costs as cloth diapers can be reused. “We use regular diapers (not cloth) during the night to ensure she sleeps well. We also use them when we travel with the baby. We use regular diapers after the oil massage, as the baby is tired after the massage and needs good sleep," Pankita said. “The other advantage of cloth diapers is that it is said to be better against a baby’s skin," she added. Also Read: Children abroad? Why parents need a power of attorneyThe couple has also taken the membership of a toy library, which costs ₹600 per month. As far as vaccination is concerned, the family went to BMC (Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation) centres, where vaccines are given for free. To be sure, the couple went to a private hospital for a few vaccines, which were unavailable at BMC centres. “We have also been lucky as there is a tradition of gifting in our family and extended family. So, we received a lot of gifts for our baby like clothes, toys, baby cot, crib, sleeping cot, stroller, etc.," Doshi added. For the baby’s first-year birthday anniversary, the couple had a small family get-together at home, which cost ₹7,000. Work set-upBoth Doshi and Pankita work in hybrid mode. This flexibility allows the couple to look after the baby. Though the family has employed a nanny, the couple said they needed to keep a watch to ensure the baby’s routine was followed. The nanny is paid ₹15,000 per month for ten hours. “My mother is also at home, but having a nanny allows everyone else to follow their own routine," he said. The self-employed parentsFor Shravan Suratwala and Divya, a Pune-based self-employed couple, the expenses of raising a child started right from Day 1 as they didn’t have maternity insurance coverage from an employer like most salaried individuals. “We had a personal insurance cover, but the waiting time on the maternity benefit was much longer," Suratwala, a chartered accountant, said. The couple spent ₹1.3 lakh in delivery costs. Suratwala said that diligently maintaining a contingency fund helped deal with these costs. “I usually keep around ₹4-5 lakh in savings, roughly five months’ worth of expenses and investments. Before delivery, I ensured it was around ₹6.5 lakh," he added. Nanny troublesSuratwala said Divya, a company secretary, largely took care of the baby during the initial months. “As we are self-employed, there was no pressure to resume work in six months. So, she was able to be with the baby for longer. It was when my wife wanted to get back to routine, we tried to work with a nanny. Our son was nine months old when we first tried one," he said. The monthly cost of getting the nanny was ₹10,000 for eight hours daily (10am-6pm). However, the couple decided to do without a nanny after trying two in two months. “We were not happy with how the nannies handled our baby. They were not open to following instructions; there was a lot of resistance to learning our ways. Also, they were not very reliable considering a proper schedule needs to be followed when a baby is around to ensure the baby’s feed timing and sleep timings don’t get disturbed," Divya said. “We decided that we need to put our son in daycare. So, when he turned one year old, we put him in daycare close to our house as it would help us get back to our routine and also help the kid be socially active and be around kids his age rather than being stuck with a nanny," he added. The couple pays ₹13,000 monthly for the daycare (10am to 6pm). The couple stays with Suratwala’s parents. However, both sets of grandparents are also pursuing their professions and businesses. In fact, Suratwala’s father is a practising chartered accountant, and the couple is working with him to expand the practice. Indirect costs of daycarePutting their son in daycare has led to some indirect healthcare costs. “We have seen our son falling sick many times after joining the daycare because kids quickly catch stuff from other kids. Nothing major, though," he said. Still, Suratwala added that they find daycare more convenient than keeping a nanny. “We get time to do our work, and the kid is not stuck with the nanny. Also, keeping just a nanny is not enough, as someone has to be around the nanny to monitor how the child is being cared for. So, the entire point of getting back to routine is defeated," he said. Second-hand baby stuffThe couple has tried to save costs where they can. “We found a platform that sold rarely-used strollers at 50% of the original cost. It’s unpredictable whether the baby will sit in the stroller and for how long. So, buying an expensive stroller did not make sense," he said. “We are also fortunate to be around people who have gifted us useful things. We got a travel stroller as a gift from our friends as we were planning an international trip with the baby," he added. Also Read: What it costs to care for aged parents in India todayOverall costsOn average, the couple has spent ₹1,500 per month on baby clothes in the first year, ₹2,000 on baby formula, ₹3,500 on diapers, ₹8,000 per month on baby massage, etc. Overall, the couple has spent ₹2.34 lakh on the baby’s first year. The first birthday party cost another ₹1 lakh. Needing a villageAs they say, you need a village to raise a child. Bengaluru-based Gunjan Vijayvargiya and Bharat Vijayvargiya had actually set up a village in their house after their baby boy’s delivery. “We had everyone at home initially: my mother, mother-in-law, father-in-law, sister-in-law, and her husband. So, we had a lot of support," Gunjan said. However, she said their household budget sky-rocketed during this period to about 2.5X. “But the family support ensured the transition was very smooth for me," she added. The search for a massage ladyWhile Gunjan doesn’t intend to keep a nanny, she has a massage lady. “Earlier, the massage lady charged us ₹3,000 per month for the baby's massage and bath. But after I went to visit my parents in Bhopal, she got other clients, and now she doesn’t have any free slots. So, she just comes to give a bath to the baby, and I do the oil massage. The lady charges us ₹1,500 per month for this," Gunjan said. She pointed out a supply-demand mismatch for massage ladies in her neighbourhood. “The massage lady we actually wanted charges ₹9,000 per month, but her slots are just unavailable," Gunjan added. Clothes and diapersGunjan said they are spending ₹5,000 on baby clothes per month. They aren't spending anything on baby formula right now, as their six-month-old baby is breastfeeding. Also Read: What parents of specially abled children must know about insurance, taxesTheir diaper costs are ₹2,000 per month. “A lot of clothes buying is impulse-driven as you always look for clothes that will look good on the baby," she added. Costly vaccinesVaccines have also been costly for the family. She said each dose so far has cost ₹9,100, with the pediatric consultation costing another ₹900 every time the vaccine is given. The doses are typically once every two months. She wants to avoid getting a nanny, as she is not comfortable with having one. "We hope my in-laws will stay with us till our son turns one year or year-and-a-half old. Then, we will see if we need to put him in daycare or playgroup," she said. Overall, if their current costs are annualized, the family is expecting to spend at least ₹2 lakh in the first year as parents. Indirect costsApart from the direct costs, the couple also spent ₹50,000 on their parents' flight tickets. When the baby turns one year old, the couple also plans to keep a small event, which would be an additional cost. Google Llc employee Aman Narang and his wife Isha Aggarwal are parents to a 14-month-old son. While now in Gurugram, the couple was in Bengaluru during their son's birth. The couple had an interesting start to spending on baby care as their parents were based in North India (Delhi and Haryana). “Initially, for support, we used to fly down our parents to Bengaluru," Narang said.

The couple is planning a 5-6 hour daycare, which would otherwise cost ₹20,000 per month. However, the couple may need to pay only ₹5,000-6,000 per month. Also read: Opinion | Know the cost of raising a child to plan in advanceTotal first-year costThe couple’s monthly expenditure on clothes worked out to be ₹3,000, diapers ₹3,300, infant formula (5th to 11th month) ₹1,750 per month and nanny (from 5th month onwards) ₹20,000 per month, paediatrician visits ₹900 per month and vaccines ₹3,500 per two months during the first year. The couple spent a total of ₹3.17 lakh in the first year. Besides this, they celebrated their son's first birthday with a resort stay, costing ₹30,000 for the family. The traditional familyMumbai-based Mayank Doshi, technology manager at Bank of America, and his wife Pankita, associate manager at Accenture, saved on costs by sticking to cloth diapers, getting their baby vaccinated at government centres, and thanks to gifting traditions in their family. The couple spent ₹2.29 lakh in their first year as parents to a 13-month-old baby girl. Pocket-friendlyDoshi said he had been lucky with costs. “My daughter breastfed for 10 months. Then, we gradually introduced her to normal buffalo milk. So, we never had to give her any formula," he said. The couple also used cloth diapers largely instead of disposable diapers. These also helped save on costs as cloth diapers can be reused. “We use regular diapers (not cloth) during the night to ensure she sleeps well. We also use them when we travel with the baby. We use regular diapers after the oil massage, as the baby is tired after the massage and needs good sleep," Pankita said. “The other advantage of cloth diapers is that it is said to be better against a baby’s skin," she added.

As far as vaccination is concerned, the family went to BMC (Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation) centres, where vaccines are given for free. To be sure, the couple went to a private hospital for a few vaccines, which were unavailable at BMC centres. “We have also been lucky as there is a tradition of gifting in our family and extended family. So, we received a lot of gifts for our baby like clothes, toys, baby cot, crib, sleeping cot, stroller, etc.," Doshi added. For the baby’s first-year birthday anniversary, the couple had a small family get-together at home, which cost ₹7,000. Work set-upBoth Doshi and Pankita work in hybrid mode. This flexibility allows the couple to look after the baby. Though the family has employed a nanny, the couple said they needed to keep a watch to ensure the baby’s routine was followed. The nanny is paid ₹15,000 per month for ten hours. “My mother is also at home, but having a nanny allows everyone else to follow their own routine," he said. The self-employed parentsFor Shravan Suratwala and Divya, a Pune-based self-employed couple, the expenses of raising a child started right from Day 1 as they didn’t have maternity insurance coverage from an employer like most salaried individuals. “We had a personal insurance cover, but the waiting time on the maternity benefit was much longer," Suratwala, a chartered accountant, said. The couple spent ₹1.3 lakh in delivery costs. Suratwala said that diligently maintaining a contingency fund helped deal with these costs. “I usually keep around ₹4-5 lakh in savings, roughly five months’ worth of expenses and investments. Before delivery, I ensured it was around ₹6.5 lakh," he added. Nanny troublesSuratwala said Divya, a company secretary, largely took care of the baby during the initial months. “As we are self-employed, there was no pressure to resume work in six months. So, she was able to be with the baby for longer. It was when my wife wanted to get back to routine, we tried to work with a nanny. Our son was nine months old when we first tried one," he said. The monthly cost of getting the nanny was ₹10,000 for eight hours daily (10am-6pm). However, the couple decided to do without a nanny after trying two in two months. “We were not happy with how the nannies handled our baby. They were not open to following instructions; there was a lot of resistance to learning our ways. Also, they were not very reliable considering a proper schedule needs to be followed when a baby is around to ensure the baby’s feed timing and sleep timings don’t get disturbed," Divya said. “We decided that we need to put our son in daycare. So, when he turned one year old, we put him in daycare close to our house as it would help us get back to our routine and also help the kid be socially active and be around kids his age rather than being stuck with a nanny," he added. The couple pays ₹13,000 monthly for the daycare (10am to 6pm). The couple stays with Suratwala’s parents. However, both sets of grandparents are also pursuing their professions and businesses. In fact, Suratwala’s father is a practising chartered accountant, and the couple is working with him to expand the practice. Indirect costs of daycarePutting their son in daycare has led to some indirect healthcare costs. “We have seen our son falling sick many times after joining the daycare because kids quickly catch stuff from other kids. Nothing major, though," he said. Still, Suratwala added that they find daycare more convenient than keeping a nanny. “We get time to do our work, and the kid is not stuck with the nanny. Also, keeping just a nanny is not enough, as someone has to be around the nanny to monitor how the child is being cared for. So, the entire point of getting back to routine is defeated," he said. Second-hand baby stuffThe couple has tried to save costs where they can. “We found a platform that sold rarely-used strollers at 50% of the original cost. It’s unpredictable whether the baby will sit in the stroller and for how long. So, buying an expensive stroller did not make sense," he said. “We are also fortunate to be around people who have gifted us useful things. We got a travel stroller as a gift from our friends as we were planning an international trip with the baby," he added.

The first birthday party cost another ₹1 lakh. Needing a villageAs they say, you need a village to raise a child. Bengaluru-based Gunjan Vijayvargiya and Bharat Vijayvargiya had actually set up a village in their house after their baby boy’s delivery. “We had everyone at home initially: my mother, mother-in-law, father-in-law, sister-in-law, and her husband. So, we had a lot of support," Gunjan said. However, she said their household budget sky-rocketed during this period to about 2.5X. “But the family support ensured the transition was very smooth for me," she added. The search for a massage ladyWhile Gunjan doesn’t intend to keep a nanny, she has a massage lady. “Earlier, the massage lady charged us ₹3,000 per month for the baby's massage and bath. But after I went to visit my parents in Bhopal, she got other clients, and now she doesn’t have any free slots. So, she just comes to give a bath to the baby, and I do the oil massage. The lady charges us ₹1,500 per month for this," Gunjan said. She pointed out a supply-demand mismatch for massage ladies in her neighbourhood. “The massage lady we actually wanted charges ₹9,000 per month, but her slots are just unavailable," Gunjan added. Clothes and diapersGunjan said they are spending ₹5,000 on baby clothes per month. They aren't spending anything on baby formula right now, as their six-month-old baby is breastfeeding. Also Read: What parents of specially abled children must know about insurance, taxesTheir diaper costs are ₹2,000 per month. “A lot of clothes buying is impulse-driven as you always look for clothes that will look good on the baby," she added. Costly vaccinesVaccines have also been costly for the family. She said each dose so far has cost ₹9,100, with the pediatric consultation costing another ₹900 every time the vaccine is given. The doses are typically once every two months. She wants to avoid getting a nanny, as she is not comfortable with having one. "We hope my in-laws will stay with us till our son turns one year or year-and-a-half old. Then, we will see if we need to put him in daycare or playgroup," she said. Overall, if their current costs are annualized, the family is expecting to spend at least ₹2 lakh in the first year as parents. Indirect costsApart from the direct costs, the couple also spent ₹50,000 on their parents' flight tickets. When the baby turns one year old, the couple also plans to keep a small event, which would be an additional cost. Credit card points helped the family save money on these frequent and often last-minute flight bookings, as the couple didn’t have any close relatives in Bengaluru for support. “I used points on my Axis Magnus credit card to book 12-13 flight tickets during that initial period of five months. If not for the card, we would've spent close to ₹1 lakh on just getting our parents to fly down here. We shelled out just ₹15,000, charged as processing fees, on this unexpected expense," he said. “There were also some last-minute cancellations, but as these tickets were booked on points, a small point-based penalty was charged, but most of the points were credited back to the account," he added.

The couple moved to Gurugram to be close to their parents, Aman’s job offer and Isha's transfer to the company’s (BlackRock Inc.) head office. The baby car seatThe couple also tried to save by getting hand-me-downs from their friends and relatives. “I got a car seat from my sister-in-law as she is in the US and there it is mandatory to have a baby car seat. She gave most of the essentials that helped manage costs, e.g., booster seat, high chair, baby monitor, clothes, etc. We got a cot from another friend as a gift. Our families also ensured that they kept our preferences in mind while getting gifts for the baby because of which we could save a lot on essentials like a stroller, baby rocker, play gyms, developmental toys, etc.," Narang said. The couple follows an interesting practice when managing their household expenses. They have a separate joint bank account, which acts like their spending account. “Monthly spending for all non-savings items happens through this account," Narang said. The spending accountIn the run-up to the pregnancy, the couple had added a buffer to this spending account, expecting a higher outgo. “We added ₹15,000 every month into this account. However, this largely got used for the delivery costs, which exceeded the insurance cover, and the cord blood preservation, which was also quite expensive," he said.

Also read: Opinion | Know the cost of raising a child to plan in advanceTotal first-year costThe couple’s monthly expenditure on clothes worked out to be ₹3,000, diapers ₹3,300, infant formula (5th to 11th month) ₹1,750 per month and nanny (from 5th month onwards) ₹20,000 per month, paediatrician visits ₹900 per month and vaccines ₹3,500 per two months during the first year. The couple spent a total of ₹3.17 lakh in the first year. Besides this, they celebrated their son's first birthday with a resort stay, costing ₹30,000 for the family. The traditional familyMumbai-based Mayank Doshi, technology manager at Bank of America, and his wife Pankita, associate manager at Accenture, saved on costs by sticking to cloth diapers, getting their baby vaccinated at government centres, and thanks to gifting traditions in their family. The couple spent ₹2.29 lakh in their first year as parents to a 13-month-old baby girl. Pocket-friendlyDoshi said he had been lucky with costs. “My daughter breastfed for 10 months. Then, we gradually introduced her to normal buffalo milk. So, we never had to give her any formula," he said. The couple also used cloth diapers largely instead of disposable diapers. These also helped save on costs as cloth diapers can be reused. “We use regular diapers (not cloth) during the night to ensure she sleeps well. We also use them when we travel with the baby. We use regular diapers after the oil massage, as the baby is tired after the massage and needs good sleep," Pankita said. “The other advantage of cloth diapers is that it is said to be better against a baby’s skin," she added.

As far as vaccination is concerned, the family went to BMC (Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation) centres, where vaccines are given for free. To be sure, the couple went to a private hospital for a few vaccines, which were unavailable at BMC centres. “We have also been lucky as there is a tradition of gifting in our family and extended family. So, we received a lot of gifts for our baby like clothes, toys, baby cot, crib, sleeping cot, stroller, etc.," Doshi added. For the baby’s first-year birthday anniversary, the couple had a small family get-together at home, which cost ₹7,000. Work set-upBoth Doshi and Pankita work in hybrid mode. This flexibility allows the couple to look after the baby. Though the family has employed a nanny, the couple said they needed to keep a watch to ensure the baby’s routine was followed. The nanny is paid ₹15,000 per month for ten hours. “My mother is also at home, but having a nanny allows everyone else to follow their own routine," he said. The self-employed parentsFor Shravan Suratwala and Divya, a Pune-based self-employed couple, the expenses of raising a child started right from Day 1 as they didn’t have maternity insurance coverage from an employer like most salaried individuals. “We had a personal insurance cover, but the waiting time on the maternity benefit was much longer," Suratwala, a chartered accountant, said. The couple spent ₹1.3 lakh in delivery costs. Suratwala said that diligently maintaining a contingency fund helped deal with these costs. “I usually keep around ₹4-5 lakh in savings, roughly five months’ worth of expenses and investments. Before delivery, I ensured it was around ₹6.5 lakh," he added. Nanny troublesSuratwala said Divya, a company secretary, largely took care of the baby during the initial months. “As we are self-employed, there was no pressure to resume work in six months. So, she was able to be with the baby for longer. It was when my wife wanted to get back to routine, we tried to work with a nanny. Our son was nine months old when we first tried one," he said. The monthly cost of getting the nanny was ₹10,000 for eight hours daily (10am-6pm). However, the couple decided to do without a nanny after trying two in two months. “We were not happy with how the nannies handled our baby. They were not open to following instructions; there was a lot of resistance to learning our ways. Also, they were not very reliable considering a proper schedule needs to be followed when a baby is around to ensure the baby’s feed timing and sleep timings don’t get disturbed," Divya said. “We decided that we need to put our son in daycare. So, when he turned one year old, we put him in daycare close to our house as it would help us get back to our routine and also help the kid be socially active and be around kids his age rather than being stuck with a nanny," he added. The couple pays ₹13,000 monthly for the daycare (10am to 6pm). The couple stays with Suratwala’s parents. However, both sets of grandparents are also pursuing their professions and businesses. In fact, Suratwala’s father is a practising chartered accountant, and the couple is working with him to expand the practice. Indirect costs of daycarePutting their son in daycare has led to some indirect healthcare costs. “We have seen our son falling sick many times after joining the daycare because kids quickly catch stuff from other kids. Nothing major, though," he said. Still, Suratwala added that they find daycare more convenient than keeping a nanny. “We get time to do our work, and the kid is not stuck with the nanny. Also, keeping just a nanny is not enough, as someone has to be around the nanny to monitor how the child is being cared for. So, the entire point of getting back to routine is defeated," he said. Second-hand baby stuffThe couple has tried to save costs where they can. “We found a platform that sold rarely-used strollers at 50% of the original cost. It’s unpredictable whether the baby will sit in the stroller and for how long. So, buying an expensive stroller did not make sense," he said. “We are also fortunate to be around people who have gifted us useful things. We got a travel stroller as a gift from our friends as we were planning an international trip with the baby," he added.

The first birthday party cost another ₹1 lakh. Needing a villageAs they say, you need a village to raise a child. Bengaluru-based Gunjan Vijayvargiya and Bharat Vijayvargiya had actually set up a village in their house after their baby boy’s delivery. “We had everyone at home initially: my mother, mother-in-law, father-in-law, sister-in-law, and her husband. So, we had a lot of support," Gunjan said. However, she said their household budget sky-rocketed during this period to about 2.5X. “But the family support ensured the transition was very smooth for me," she added. The search for a massage ladyWhile Gunjan doesn’t intend to keep a nanny, she has a massage lady. “Earlier, the massage lady charged us ₹3,000 per month for the baby's massage and bath. But after I went to visit my parents in Bhopal, she got other clients, and now she doesn’t have any free slots. So, she just comes to give a bath to the baby, and I do the oil massage. The lady charges us ₹1,500 per month for this," Gunjan said. She pointed out a supply-demand mismatch for massage ladies in her neighbourhood. “The massage lady we actually wanted charges ₹9,000 per month, but her slots are just unavailable," Gunjan added. Clothes and diapersGunjan said they are spending ₹5,000 on baby clothes per month. They aren't spending anything on baby formula right now, as their six-month-old baby is breastfeeding. Also Read: What parents of specially abled children must know about insurance, taxesTheir diaper costs are ₹2,000 per month. “A lot of clothes buying is impulse-driven as you always look for clothes that will look good on the baby," she added. Costly vaccinesVaccines have also been costly for the family. She said each dose so far has cost ₹9,100, with the pediatric consultation costing another ₹900 every time the vaccine is given. The doses are typically once every two months. She wants to avoid getting a nanny, as she is not comfortable with having one. "We hope my in-laws will stay with us till our son turns one year or year-and-a-half old. Then, we will see if we need to put him in daycare or playgroup," she said. Overall, if their current costs are annualized, the family is expecting to spend at least ₹2 lakh in the first year as parents. Indirect costsApart from the direct costs, the couple also spent ₹50,000 on their parents' flight tickets. When the baby turns one year old, the couple also plans to keep a small event, which would be an additional cost. In the run-up to the pregnancy, the couple had added a buffer to this spending account, expecting a higher outgo. “We added ₹15,000 every month into this account. However, this largely got used for the delivery costs, which exceeded the insurance cover, and the cord blood preservation, which was also quite expensive," he said. The employer benefitThe couple plans to put their son in daycare in the next few months. Here, Narang will benefit from his employer’s collaboration with daycare providers. “So, we should get discounts on the daycare costs," he said. The couple is planning a 5-6 hour daycare, which would otherwise cost ₹20,000 per month. However, the couple may need to pay only ₹5,000-6,000 per month.

Nothing major, though," he said. Still, Suratwala added that they find daycare more convenient than keeping a nanny. “We get time to do our work, and the kid is not stuck with the nanny. Also, keeping just a nanny is not enough, as someone has to be around the nanny to monitor how the child is being cared for. So, the entire point of getting back to routine is defeated," he said. Second-hand baby stuffThe couple has tried to save costs where they can. “We found a platform that sold rarely-used strollers at 50% of the original cost. It’s unpredictable whether the baby will sit in the stroller and for how long. So, buying an expensive stroller did not make sense," he said. “We are also fortunate to be around people who have gifted us useful things. We got a travel stroller as a gift from our friends as we were planning an international trip with the baby," he added.

The first birthday party cost another ₹1 lakh. Needing a villageAs they say, you need a village to raise a child. Bengaluru-based Gunjan Vijayvargiya and Bharat Vijayvargiya had actually set up a village in their house after their baby boy’s delivery. “We had everyone at home initially: my mother, mother-in-law, father-in-law, sister-in-law, and her husband. So, we had a lot of support," Gunjan said. However, she said their household budget sky-rocketed during this period to about 2.5X. “But the family support ensured the transition was very smooth for me," she added. The search for a massage ladyWhile Gunjan doesn’t intend to keep a nanny, she has a massage lady. “Earlier, the massage lady charged us ₹3,000 per month for the baby's massage and bath. But after I went to visit my parents in Bhopal, she got other clients, and now she doesn’t have any free slots. So, she just comes to give a bath to the baby, and I do the oil massage. The lady charges us ₹1,500 per month for this," Gunjan said. She pointed out a supply-demand mismatch for massage ladies in her neighbourhood. “The massage lady we actually wanted charges ₹9,000 per month, but her slots are just unavailable," Gunjan added. Clothes and diapersGunjan said they are spending ₹5,000 on baby clothes per month. They aren't spending anything on baby formula right now, as their six-month-old baby is breastfeeding. Also Read: What parents of specially abled children must know about insurance, taxesTheir diaper costs are ₹2,000 per month. “A lot of clothes buying is impulse-driven as you always look for clothes that will look good on the baby," she added. Costly vaccinesVaccines have also been costly for the family. She said each dose so far has cost ₹9,100, with the pediatric consultation costing another ₹900 every time the vaccine is given. The doses are typically once every two months. She wants to avoid getting a nanny, as she is not comfortable with having one. "We hope my in-laws will stay with us till our son turns one year or year-and-a-half old. Then, we will see if we need to put him in daycare or playgroup," she said. Overall, if their current costs are annualized, the family is expecting to spend at least ₹2 lakh in the first year as parents. Indirect costsApart from the direct costs, the couple also spent ₹50,000 on their parents' flight tickets. When the baby turns one year old, the couple also plans to keep a small event, which would be an additional cost. Mumbai-based Mayank Doshi, technology manager at Bank of America, and his wife Pankita, associate manager at Accenture, saved on costs by sticking to cloth diapers, getting their baby vaccinated at government centres, and thanks to gifting traditions in their family. The couple spent ₹2.29 lakh in their first year as parents to a 13-month-old baby girl. Pocket-friendlyDoshi said he had been lucky with costs. “My daughter breastfed for 10 months. Then, we gradually introduced her to normal buffalo milk. So, we never had to give her any formula," he said. The couple also used cloth diapers largely instead of disposable diapers. These also helped save on costs as cloth diapers can be reused. “We use regular diapers (not cloth) during the night to ensure she sleeps well. We also use them when we travel with the baby. We use regular diapers after the oil massage, as the baby is tired after the massage and needs good sleep," Pankita said. “The other advantage of cloth diapers is that it is said to be better against a baby’s skin," she added.

As far as vaccination is concerned, the family went to BMC (Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation) centres, where vaccines are given for free. To be sure, the couple went to a private hospital for a few vaccines, which were unavailable at BMC centres. “We have also been lucky as there is a tradition of gifting in our family and extended family. So, we received a lot of gifts for our baby like clothes, toys, baby cot, crib, sleeping cot, stroller, etc.," Doshi added. For the baby’s first-year birthday anniversary, the couple had a small family get-together at home, which cost ₹7,000. Work set-upBoth Doshi and Pankita work in hybrid mode. This flexibility allows the couple to look after the baby. Though the family has employed a nanny, the couple said they needed to keep a watch to ensure the baby’s routine was followed. The nanny is paid ₹15,000 per month for ten hours. “My mother is also at home, but having a nanny allows everyone else to follow their own routine," he said. The self-employed parentsFor Shravan Suratwala and Divya, a Pune-based self-employed couple, the expenses of raising a child started right from Day 1 as they didn’t have maternity insurance coverage from an employer like most salaried individuals. “We had a personal insurance cover, but the waiting time on the maternity benefit was much longer," Suratwala, a chartered accountant, said. The couple spent ₹1.3 lakh in delivery costs. Suratwala said that diligently maintaining a contingency fund helped deal with these costs. “I usually keep around ₹4-5 lakh in savings, roughly five months’ worth of expenses and investments. Before delivery, I ensured it was around ₹6.5 lakh," he added. Nanny troublesSuratwala said Divya, a company secretary, largely took care of the baby during the initial months. “As we are self-employed, there was no pressure to resume work in six months. So, she was able to be with the baby for longer. It was when my wife wanted to get back to routine, we tried to work with a nanny. Our son was nine months old when we first tried one," he said. The monthly cost of getting the nanny was ₹10,000 for eight hours daily (10am-6pm). However, the couple decided to do without a nanny after trying two in two months. “We were not happy with how the nannies handled our baby. They were not open to following instructions; there was a lot of resistance to learning our ways. Also, they were not very reliable considering a proper schedule needs to be followed when a baby is around to ensure the baby’s feed timing and sleep timings don’t get disturbed," Divya said. “We decided that we need to put our son in daycare. So, when he turned one year old, we put him in daycare close to our house as it would help us get back to our routine and also help the kid be socially active and be around kids his age rather than being stuck with a nanny," he added. The couple pays ₹13,000 monthly for the daycare (10am to 6pm). The couple stays with Suratwala’s parents. However, both sets of grandparents are also pursuing their professions and businesses.

"We hope my in-laws will stay with us till our son turns one year or year-and-a-half old. Then, we will see if we need to put him in daycare or playgroup," she said. Overall, if their current costs are annualized, the family is expecting to spend at least ₹2 lakh in the first year as parents. Indirect costsApart from the direct costs, the couple also spent ₹50,000 on their parents' flight tickets. When the baby turns one year old, the couple also plans to keep a small event, which would be an additional cost. For Shravan Suratwala and Divya, a Pune-based self-employed couple, the expenses of raising a child started right from Day 1 as they didn’t have maternity insurance coverage from an employer like most salaried individuals. “We had a personal insurance cover, but the waiting time on the maternity benefit was much longer," Suratwala, a chartered accountant, said. The couple spent ₹1.3 lakh in delivery costs. Suratwala said that diligently maintaining a contingency fund helped deal with these costs. “I usually keep around ₹4-5 lakh in savings, roughly five months’ worth of expenses and investments. Before delivery, I ensured it was around ₹6.5 lakh," he added. Nanny troublesSuratwala said Divya, a company secretary, largely took care of the baby during the initial months. “As we are self-employed, there was no pressure to resume work in six months. So, she was able to be with the baby for longer. It was when my wife wanted to get back to routine, we tried to work with a nanny. Our son was nine months old when we first tried one," he said. The monthly cost of getting the nanny was ₹10,000 for eight hours daily (10am-6pm). However, the couple decided to do without a nanny after trying two in two months. “We were not happy with how the nannies handled our baby. They were not open to following instructions; there was a lot of resistance to learning our ways. Also, they were not very reliable considering a proper schedule needs to be followed when a baby is around to ensure the baby’s feed timing and sleep timings don’t get disturbed," Divya said. “We decided that we need to put our son in daycare. So, when he turned one year old, we put him in daycare close to our house as it would help us get back to our routine and also help the kid be socially active and be around kids his age rather than being stuck with a nanny," he added. The couple pays ₹13,000 monthly for the daycare (10am to 6pm). The couple stays with Suratwala’s parents. However, both sets of grandparents are also pursuing their professions and businesses. In fact, Suratwala’s father is a practising chartered accountant, and the couple is working with him to expand the practice. Indirect costs of daycarePutting their son in daycare has led to some indirect healthcare costs. “We have seen our son falling sick many times after joining the daycare because kids quickly catch stuff from other kids. Nothing major, though," he said. Still, Suratwala added that they find daycare more convenient than keeping a nanny. “We get time to do our work, and the kid is not stuck with the nanny. Also, keeping just a nanny is not enough, as someone has to be around the nanny to monitor how the child is being cared for. So, the entire point of getting back to routine is defeated," he said. Second-hand baby stuffThe couple has tried to save costs where they can. “We found a platform that sold rarely-used strollers at 50% of the original cost. It’s unpredictable whether the baby will sit in the stroller and for how long. So, buying an expensive stroller did not make sense," he said. “We are also fortunate to be around people who have gifted us useful things. We got a travel stroller as a gift from our friends as we were planning an international trip with the baby," he added.

The first birthday party cost another ₹1 lakh. Needing a villageAs they say, you need a village to raise a child. Bengaluru-based Gunjan Vijayvargiya and Bharat Vijayvargiya had actually set up a village in their house after their baby boy’s delivery. “We had everyone at home initially: my mother, mother-in-law, father-in-law, sister-in-law, and her husband. So, we had a lot of support," Gunjan said. However, she said their household budget sky-rocketed during this period to about 2.5X. “But the family support ensured the transition was very smooth for me," she added. The search for a massage ladyWhile Gunjan doesn’t intend to keep a nanny, she has a massage lady. “Earlier, the massage lady charged us ₹3,000 per month for the baby's massage and bath. But after I went to visit my parents in Bhopal, she got other clients, and now she doesn’t have any free slots. So, she just comes to give a bath to the baby, and I do the oil massage. The lady charges us ₹1,500 per month for this," Gunjan said. She pointed out a supply-demand mismatch for massage ladies in her neighbourhood. “The massage lady we actually wanted charges ₹9,000 per month, but her slots are just unavailable," Gunjan added. Clothes and diapersGunjan said they are spending ₹5,000 on baby clothes per month. They aren't spending anything on baby formula right now, as their six-month-old baby is breastfeeding.

Title: ‘We’re fully booked’: How grind schools became big business
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/education/2024/10/20/were-fully-booked-how-grind-schools-became-big-business/

Yvonne O’Toole, principal of the Institute of Education, is standing outside the school’s entrance on Dublin’s Leeson Street as hordes of students pour outside on their lunch break. She’s beaming – and with good reason. The private grinds college, where full-time students pay annual fees of up to €11,000 a year, has enrolled a record 1,650 students this year. There is a long waiting list to gain entry to sixth year, while thousands more students are due to attend its revision courses over the coming months. “We’re officially the largest school in Ireland,” says O’Toole. “I’m very proud of the school, but I’m actually very proud of that fact.” Business is booming in Ireland’s grinds industry, which is estimated to be worth anywhere between €30-40 million a year. The institute, founded more than 50 years ago, was sold to UK-based schools group Dukes Education last year for just under €135 million. Its main competitor, the Dublin Academy of Education in Stillorgan, south Dublin, is also running at capacity. It has about 340 full-time fifth- and sixth-year students and is due to expand next year when it moves to a larger premises in Blackrock. The online grinds business is also heating up. A newcomer on the scene is Grinds360, which raised more than €3 million from investors who include former and present rugby players such as Brian O’Driscoll, Caelan Doris and Jordan Larmour. The service promises “cutting-edge AI technology” and some of Ireland’s best teachers with a track record of delivering “exceptional student results” for up to 19 subjects for a cost of €999 a year. There are dozens of other online competitors such as Studyclix (up to €75 a year), as well as private grinds offered by individual teachers in almost every town and village across the country (sometimes the same teachers who teach children in class) typically for €50 an hour. There is a growing grinds culture in Ireland, far in excess of many other European countries. Almost 60 per cent of Leaving Cert students are estimated to be availing of grinds, up from below 50 per cent a decade ago, according to a 2022 ESRI study. They are most common among children of well-off professional or managerial parents hoping to give their sons and daughters an edge in the CAO points race. The study’s authors, Prof Selina McCoy and Prof Delma Byrne, found that the grinds culture had become normalised, stemming from the high-stakes nature of the Leaving Cert. They said they were now “an accepted component of examination success for many students”. Since Covid, in particular, many grind schools say demand has “exploded” due to a combination of grade inflation, higher CAO points and a sense that competition for top college courses has grown even fiercer. “It just skyrocketed over the last few years and got crazy with demand for grinds ,” says Rónán Murdock, a former grinds teacher who is now chief executive of Grinds360. The sector has no shortage of critics. The education establishment tends to depict grind schools as military training grounds where students are drilled to produce perfect answers to potential questions based on marking schemes. Others argue that students who leave their regular school to attend full-time grinds lose their social ties with friends and are deprived of a rounded education with access to sport, extracurricular activities and pastoral supports. Campaigners, such as Prof Kathleen Lynch, argue more broadly that grinds contribute to inequality by allowing the most affluent to give their children an advantage to dominate entry to the most elite higher education courses. Naturally, grind schools see things very differently. At the Dublin Academy of Education, the bright classrooms with multicoloured furniture are full to capacity. “We’re an academic school rather than a holistic school,” says Ciarán Hartigan, the school principal. “Our primary focus is on the academics rather than trying to shape the individual as a whole.” Contrary to public perception, he says grind schools are not about cramming, rote learning or teaching to the test, he says. “The idea that a student could just learn off a number of essays and regurgitate them blindly in the exam and get full marks? That day is gone. It hasn’t worked since the ‘90s, and I’m not sure how well it ever worked.” The focus, he says, is on developing an understanding a subject through “great teaching”, as well as how to succeed in the exam. Over at the Institute of Education, O’Toole also says the traditional depiction of a grind school is misplaced. She says her “independent school” now offers sports, extracurricular activities such as debating and robotics, while there is big focus on guidance and wellbeing. It is, however, unashamedly academic in focus. “It’s important to say, this school isn’t for everybody,” O’Toole says. “We interview students coming in here and ask: ‘Is this school right for you?’ You have to be hardworking. You don’t have to be 600 points. You might be heading for 450 – great – but you have to want to work. It’s about that passion of wanting to work.” The school’s intake, she says, includes students from right across the city and wider commuter belt. “Most of our parents struggle to pay the fees. Many of them take out a loan to pay the fees,” she says. “They value education and many of them have saved for many years to send their students to us.” The growth of the grinds industry means there is fierce competition for the best teachers. Those who are textbook authors or State exam markers are in high demand. In some cases, the most highly regarded educators are on hefty six-figure salaries. At Grinds360, Murdock says his service has hired 15 teachers, 11 on a full-time basis. While top teachers can earn considerable sums, he says they are made to work for it. “I was one of those grinds teachers paid a really high salary, but you work incredibly hard; you can be working six days a week, giving up your evenings all the time,” he says. “Yes, the money can be brilliant but the volume of work is huge. If you’re a brilliant economics teacher, you might have 200 students and then 200 projects. A student might send your four or five emails on that project, and suddenly that’s 1,000 emails. You’re looked after, but your workload increases massively.” The popularity of grinds, however, is beginning to raise uncomfortable questions around the quality of teaching in regular schools. Teacher shortages in key subject areas mean many students have either reduced subject choice or may be taught by an unqualified or “out of field” teacher. Parents often are unaware, given that principals fear reputational damage if they highlight these difficulties. Some schools, especially in the south Dublin area, have been losing significant numbers of students to grind schools as a result. Another attraction, say some grind school operators, is the older age profile of students who want more independence and fewer rules. Hartigan, principal of the Dublin Academy, says they offer a “college-lite” atmosphere: there is no uniform, no bell for classes and no parent-teacher meetings. Mobile phones are allowed in common areas, but not in classes or the study hall. “My own experience personally in traditional schools was that with senior students ... they’ve almost outgrown a particular education environment or set of rules which are imposed on them,” he says. For all the cost of grinds, however, the extent to which they boost students’ performance is uncertain. The most recent ESRI study on this area found that private tuition appeared to pay off only for students with lower levels of achievement, with little if any gain for their middle and higher achieving peers. It does raise the question: is this a sector simply feeding into students’ – and parents’ – insecurities about the Leaving Cert? Murdock of Grinds360 says, if anything, they are easing students’ anxieties; additional tuition complements, rather than supplants, what a student learns in their regular school. “They give another perspective to students which can bolster their answers,” he says. “Students are working very hard and there is a lot of pressure to get the course done and pressure on points ... with online videos, they don’t have to worry about missing parts of the course. If anything, this is reducing stress.” © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Wall Street Giant Morgan Stanley Bets Big On Bitcoin ETF: $272 Million Revealed

Last January 10th, 2024, the US Securities and Exchange Commission finally approved the Bitcoin ETF applications of 11 funds, including Fidelity, Grayscale, and Blackrock’s IBIT. Within a month, trading volume increased as more banks, funds, and individual traders got a share. One market participant that’s slowly boosting its holdings is Morgan Stanley. In its recent 13F-HR/A filing with the SEC, Morgan Stanley declared $272 million worth of Bitcoin ETFs at the end of the third quarter. Although this seems like a sizeable investment, it only accounts for 2% of the total assets in management, now valued at $1.3 trillion. Massive news! 🚨 Morgan Stanley, a $1.3 trillion asset manager, just disclosed $272 million in Bitcoin ETF holdings. This is a clear sign that institutional adoption is accelerating. As more major players like Morgan Stanley continue buying into Bitcoin, it’s creating… https://t.co/bkCt59bSrD — Jimie (@Your_NLP_Coach) October 18, 2024 Morgan Stanley keeps its holdings in different baskets like a seasoned trader and investor. Many of its holdings are with Blackrock’s iShare Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). Management reported that it now owns 5.5 million shares of the BTC ETF, which it bought in the second quarter. Morgan Stanley’s holdings with Blackrock were worth $187.7 million at the time of the transaction but are now worth $209 million, or an increase of 10.2%. The company also shared that it holds a sizable holding with Ark 21 Shares but has reduced its holdings with Grayscale. Initially, Morgan Stanley boasted holdings worth $270 million, but they’re now down to $148,000. Morgan Stanley is one of the top asset managers with a Bitcoin and crypto-friendly strategy. Although the company was late in investing in Bitcoin ETFs, it still managed to build one of the most significant holdings in the United States. In August 2024, the company gave the go-signal to its managers to offer Bitcoin ETFs as an option for its wealthy customers. Considering its huge asset base, this was a significant move for the company. For example, if its manager allocates just 1% of the company’s assets to Bitcoin ETFs, it will create an inflow of $130 billion. The SEC’s approval of spot ETFs was a game-changer for the industry. According to analyst Kripto Mevsimi, Bitcoin is now a more mature asset and is starting to become an integral part of the financial market. The market continues to support Bitcoin ETFs, with impressive net flows in the last four days. Funds bought over $470 million worth of BTC yesterday, an improvement from Wednesday’s inflow. Again, IBIT leads the game with an inflow of $309 million. Also, ARKB notched an impressive day with a $100.2 million inflow. GBTC was also positive, getting $45.7 million yesterday.

Title: Bitcoin Poised To Reshape Global Finance And Public Markets
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidbirnbaum/2024/10/19/bitcoin-poised-to-reshape-global-finance-and-public-markets/

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images) Bitcoin has achieved a 1.3 trillion dollar market cap and boasts hundreds of millions of users, but it is still met by some with skepticism, fear, and even disdain. Detractors label it a tool for criminals or speculative gamble with no real future in the global financial system. Even today, remnants of that narrative persist among those who serve as a mouthpiece for big banks and deny its transformative potential. However, over the past 15 years, bitcoin has transitioned from being primarily a grassroots movement among individuals to gaining rapid adoption within institutional finance. Bitcoin's early detractors were not unjustified. In its initial stages, the project could well have failed. However, now that it has demonstrated its staying power, major financial institutions, hedge funds, and even sovereign entities have begun to explore bitcoin as a store of value. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, has recently positioned himself as a prominent advocate. Once a skeptic, Fink now believes bitcoin is on the path to becoming a standalone asset class, comparable to other financial innovations that began slowly and later scaled, such as the mortgage and high-yield bond markets. He dismisses the notion that Bbitcoin’s trajectory depends on political outcomes, stating that neither U.S. presidential candidate will significantly alter its growth. This bullish stance is underscored by the success of BlackRock’s spot bitcoin ETF, which launched in January 2024 and has already amassed over $23 billion in assets. The record-breaking inflows into bitcoin ETFs signal a growing institutional appetite, outpacing even gold-based products in terms of capital inflows. In just ten months, bitcoin ETFs have attracted nearly $20 billion, compared to gold ETFs, which have only drawn $1.4 billion despite reaching record highs 30 times this year. This divergence highlights bitcoin’s growing recognition as a store of value and hedge against economic instability. As Standard Chartered predicts bitcoin could reach $200,000 by 2025, regardless of U.S. election outcomes, it is clear that institutional money is increasingly flowing into Bitcoin, solidifying its role as a financial powerhouse in the global investment landscape. A pivotal moment in this shift occurred when publicly traded companies began accumulating bitcoin on their balance sheets not merely as an investment but as part of a broader treasury strategy. MicroStrategy in particular has become a key player in this trend, demonstrating how bitcoin can serve as a strategic asset in the unusual time period in which we live – when an entirely new form of base money is coming into existence. In 2020, MicroStrategy's CEO, Michael Saylor, made headlines when the company announced it had converted its cash reserves into bitcoin, citing the long-term devaluation of fiat currencies and the need for a harder asset to preserve wealth. This decision was not just an isolated bet on bitcoin's future value but part of a larger strategy to capitalize on the unique properties of bitcoin as both a store of value and a strategic financial asset. Unpacking MicroStrategy’s bitcoin initiative, which is now colloquially called the “MicroStrategy playbook” and is being copied by other companies such as Metaplanet, will help illustrate why bitcoin is set to disrupt corporate finance. At the core of MicroStrategy’s approach is the use of convertible debt to fund the purchase of bitcoin on an ongoing basis. By issuing convertible notes at low interest rates and using the proceeds to buy bitcoin, MicroStrategy has effectively become long on “global carry” – borrowing at low interest rates while investing in an asset that has the potential to appreciate significantly over time. At the same time, holding bitcoin itself positions the company short on global carry because bitcoin is inherently deflationary – its supply remains predictable as global liquidity increases, leaving only its price to respond to increasing demand. This dual position – being long and short on global carry simultaneously – is unique. It turns MicroStrategy into what could be described as a modern version of a 60/40 portfolio, with the key difference being that both positions (long and short) are embedded within the same asset. Saylor has created a scenario where MicroStrategy is capitalizing on both global liquidity and bitcoin’s scarcity to create what some have dubbed an infinite money glitch. It's a remarkable demonstration of financial engineering that could only happen in these early days of bitcoin’s monetization. For decades, the 60/40 portfolio – a mix of 60% equities and 40% bonds – was the gold standard for conservative investors. The theory behind it was simple: equities would provide growth, while bonds would provide stability and income, balancing risk and reward. However, in an economic environment marked by low interest rates and rampant money printing, this traditional model does not work as well as it used to. Bonds are now risky, and the performance of the stock market is tied to a tiny handful of companies that are monopolistic and highly regulated. The outsized performance of a select few companies – the so-called "Magnificent Seven" – has skewed overall market returns, masking weaker performances elsewhere. By mid-2024, this group, including giants like Apple, Microsoft, and Tesla, delivered an average return of 57% over the previous year, more than double the 25% return of the broader S&P 500. Without these seven mega-cap stocks, which now make up 31% of the S&P 500 by weight, the index’s returns would have been significantly weaker. In fact, if they were excluded, the S&P 500's year-to-date gain of 18.1% as of July 2024 would be reduced to just 9%. This disparity illustrates how concentrated market performance has become. The decision by companies like MicroStrategy to adopt bitcoin is not simply a bet on price appreciation; it represents a fundamental shift in how businesses view treasury management in an increasingly unstable economic landscape. For decades, corporations have relied on cash reserves, bonds, and other fiat-based assets to manage their balance sheets. However, as central banks and regulators around the world now constantly intervene in the economy to achieve political ends, these traditional assets are losing their ability to preserve value. Bitcoin, by contrast, offers a flexible, low-maintenance store of value that has virtually no maintenance costs, and is immune to inflationary devaluation. Moreover, as bitcoin becomes more widely adopted, its liquidity and market infrastructure continue to improve, making it easier for institutions to buy, sell, and hold large quantities without disrupting the market. MicroStrategy’s move to adopt bitcoin as a core treasury asset highlights the growing realization that bitcoin’s potential is far greater than many initially believed. The company’s innovative approach to leveraging both global liquidity and Bitcoin’s scarcity has not only outperformed traditional financial strategies but also demonstrated how Bitcoin can provide a strategic advantage in an inflationary fiat environment. At the time of writing, bitcoin’s market capitalization hovers around $1.3 trillion, roughly a tenth of gold’s $13 trillion. While bitcoin has already proven itself as one of the best-performing assets of the past decade, the potential for future growth is enormous. If bitcoin continues to be adopted by institutions, governments, and corporations, it could easily rival or surpass gold’s market cap, and even one day become a $100 trillion asset class. MicroStrategy’s bold moves are just the beginning of what could be a massive shift in corporate finance. If more companies recognize this unique moment for what it is, they too could take advantage of MicroStrategy’s infinite money glitch. It now appears that the next wave of bitcoin adoption will come by way of corporate balance sheets, marking the beginning of a new chapter in this fascinating story. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: $33.14 Billion At Risk If The Bitcoin Price Hits $72,462, Here’s Why

Crypto analyst Ash Crypto has alerted the crypto community that $33.14 billion is at risk if the Bitcoin price reaches $72,462. This relates to the short positions that could be liquidated if the flagship crypto hits that price target, a development that will be bullish for BTC. Ash Crypto mentioned the liquidation alert in an X post, revealing that $33.14 billion worth of shorts will be liquidated if the Bitcoin price hits $72,462. These BTC bears are already in danger of getting liquidated, considering that the flagship crypto is fast approaching the $70,000 price level. This could pave the way for an extended rally to this liquidation price and even beyond. The liquidations of these Bitcoin shorts could be bullish for the flagship crypto, leading to an extended rally to new highs, especially with the current ATH of $73,00 being in sight once the price hits $72,462. However, there is also a scenario where the Bitcoin price could correct to flush out overleveraged longs before it continues with its move to the upside. For now, the Bitcoin price undoubtedly boasts a bullish outlook, considering how the flagship crypto has rallied since the start of this week. BTC briefly touched $69,000 on October 18, further providing optimism that the crypto could reach a new ATH soon enough. Standard Chartered recently predicted that it will likely happen before the November 5 US elections. Although that remains to be seen, it is worth mentioning that Bitcoin’s demand is again on the rise, which could fuel this rally to a new ATH. Specifically, the Spot Bitcoin ETFs, which fueled the run to a new ATH earlier in the year, are again actively accumulating. SpotOnChain data shows that these Bitcoin ETFs witnessed a net inflow of $2.13 billion this week. BlackRock, in particular, added $1.14 billion worth of BTC to its holdings. Analyst Justin Bennett, known for bearish analysis, has warned traders to be cautious about trading amid this recent Bitcoin price rally. He stated that things do not add up and that staying cautious during periods like this is the best way to survive. He added that he won’t be making any bold predictions at the moment because the data is conflicting. However, he suggested that market participants shouldn’t be excited about Bitcoin’s breakout from the seven-month range. This followed his statement that the rally was primarily perp-driven and that open interest is back at its late July peak. Crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto, who has been a Bitcoin bear lately, also warned that the Bitcoin price rally is being driven by the perpetuals market. In a recent X post, he noted that open interest has officially surpassed the level it was at before the last BTC drop from $70,000 to $49,000.

Title: Goldman Sachs: The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) Is A Stock With High Consensus ROE

We recently looked at Goldman Sachs’ Stocks With Highest Consensus Returns: 42 Stocks With The Highest Consensus ROE. In this piece, we will look at where The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) ranks in the list. As the fourth quarter of 2024 settles in, the narrative surrounding stocks on Wall Street is starting to shift. This is unsurprising since the beginning of the Federal Reserve’s interest rate cycles stands to change economic conditions in America. These will naturally affect businesses, and cyclical stocks along with financials should see an improved outlook. For instance, consider two reports by investment bank Morgan Stanley. One of these was released before the interest rate cut, and it covered the bank’s thoughts about the stock market and the US economy for September. The other came in October, after the rate cut. In its September report, MS laid out three scenarios for the flagship S&P index’s performance for the rest of this year. The best case scenario posits that the index would close at 5,650 points in the near term, while the “attractive” and “fair” scenarios predict a closing of 5,200 and 5,350 points, respectively. Yet, the market has outperformed even the best scenario, as its recent reading is 5,764. READ ALSO 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock The bank also shares that inflation is finally dropping in America. This fact is explained through the S&P’s second quarter earnings performance. In fact, the shifting inflationary trends have set new highs for a decade when we consider sales and earnings surprises for the index according to MS. Its data shows that when inflation was soaring in Q4 2022, the net of positive and negative EPS surprises stood in lowest quintile since businesses struggled with costs. This was despite the fact that during the same time period the net of positive and negative revenue surprises was in the 70% percentile. However, now that inflation has dropped, data for the second quarter earnings season shows that the EPS surprise was in the uppermost quintile (above 80%) while the revenue surprise had dropped to roughly 35%. This data covers the past ten years, and as a result, it illustrates the momentous shifts that the market is undergoing right now. Since interest rates are the hottest topic on Wall Street, MS also commented on its expectations for them. At the September start, the bank posited that markets were expecting 100 basis points of cuts by 2024 end. The bank shared that it thought “this looks aggressive unless the U.S. economy has a hard landing, but this is not our base case.” With September’s 50 basis points cut out of the way, these expectations have remained unchanged as the CME Fed Watch Tool shows that for the Fed’s November and December meetings, the market has set the probabilities for a 25 basis point cut in each at 85.5% and 82.1%, respectively. These cuts are important for determining the market’s direction, as MS’ data shows that when economic activity as measured by the ISM Manufacturing Index sat at ~67 in 2010, the S&P’s 12 month total return was 30%. Shifting gears to the October report, MS cautions that while historically equities have outperformed following the first Fed rate cut, elevated valuations, and “consensus forecasting of EPS acceleration rather than decline, equities upside after the first cut may prove more limited this cycle.” The bank’s key stock market insight from its October report comes through its comments about cyclical stocks, though. MS shares that as upward economic growth surprises softened from April through August, “sector and factor trends skewed defensive, consistent with softer economic growth.” However, this might not be the case moving forward, as shown by the Citi Global Economic Surprise Index. MS outlines that this index had bottomed out in August with a ~-25 reading, which had jumped to roughly -12 in September. This trend was mirrored in the difference between global cyclical and defensive sectors, with the reading also moving upward as the economic surprises jumped. These factors are key when we analyze Goldman Sachs’ list of stocks with the highest expected ROE since the bank believes that stock quality will be determined by economic growth and economic rates. The bank also recently upped its 2024 closing target for the S&P to 6,000 points. This was the fourth revision of its target and a sizeable increase from the previous estimate of 5,600 points. This increase was also accompanied by optimism for the index’s earnings. GS now believes that S&P’s 2025 earnings will sit at $268, for a 4.7% revision from the previous estimate of $256. Its 2024 estimate is unchanged, though, and its value of $241 implies that earnings next year will grow by 11.2%. As for the next 12 months, GS believes that the S&P will sit at 6,300 points, for an 8.9% growth over its recent value of 5,779. As MS’ data pointed out that EPS surprises are growing as inflation tames, Goldman is also of a similar view. This is because the bank’s chief US equity strategist David Kostin shares that the upward EPS revision is reflective of the fact that the “macro backdrop remains conducive to modest margin expansion, with prices charged outpacing input cost growth.” In a later note, the analyst outlined that “Over the past year, performance of several quality factors has tracked the broad trajectory of market views on growth and monetary policy.” Kostin added that “A positive jobs print could prompt some investors to rotate out of expensive ‘quality’ stocks into less-loved lower quality firms as the market would likely price lower odds of substantial labor market weakening.” Our Methodology To make our list of Goldman Sachs’ stocks with the highest consensus ROE, we used the bank’s latest list of 50 such stocks and chose those with a 5% or higher consensus ROE.

Consensus ROE: 24% Number of Hedge Fund Investors in Q2 2024: 47 The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) is one of the most well known consumer beauty products companies in the world. Since it is a prestige beauty brand company, naturally, the shares do not perform well when inflation is high. This has been the case recently, as The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL)’s shares have lost 34.7% and 32.51% year to date and over the past twelve months, respectively. A large portion of this underperformance has been because of the firm’s woes in China where economic troubles have been more severe and longstanding compared to the West. During its fiscal year 2024, The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL)’s Asia/Pacific sales dropped by 6% annually, and the firm attributed the drop primarily to China. Asia/Pacific accounted for 31% of the firm’s sales in FY24, making the drops hard hitting on its impact statement. Travel retail is another troubled segment for The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL), and a drop in Asia sales further impacted earnings. With the overall sentiment remaining dour, here’s what The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) shared for its FY25 outlook during the Q4 FY24 earnings call: “Looking ahead, our fiscal year 2025 outlook reflects continued declines in the prestige beauty industry in China and Asia travel retail. While the PRGP, which remains on track relatively to our previously stated goals, enable us to offset the pressure to profitability from declines in areas of our business that have high penetration of skin care, it yields a slower pace of operating margin expansions for fiscal year 2025 than we had previously expected when we expanded the PRGP in February. For fiscal year 2025, in the rest of our global business, we are planning to deliver improved performance across both developed and emerging markets. To fuel this, our strategic priorities are reigniting skin care, capitalizing on the multiple growth drivers of high-end fragrance, moving faster in leveraging winning channels, launching accretive innovation inclusive of new, big opportunities and enhancing our precision marketing capabilities for increased effectiveness and efficiency of our consumer facing investments. The PRGP enables and accelerates these strategy priorities and is the foundation to restore sustainable long-term organic sales growth and to rebuild our operating profitability. We are also creating a faster and leaner organization that will more quickly adapt to market dynamics and be better able to leverage future growth. While our sales and profit outlook for fiscal year 2025 is disappointing, this year we will make important strides as we implement our strategy reset to continue rebalancing regional growth, deliver improved annual profitability, strengthen go-to-market and innovation capabilities to elevate our execution in response to a more competitive market. These efforts will position us to both outperform the prestige beauty industry in fiscal year 2026 and accelerate profitability expansion.” Overall EL ranks 13th on our list of stocks with the highest consensus ROE according to Goldman Sachs. While we acknowledge the potential of EL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than EL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Goldman Sachs: Targa Resources Corp. (NYSE:TRGP) Is A Stock With High Consensus ROE

We recently looked at Goldman Sachs’ Stocks With Highest Consensus Returns: 42 Stocks With The Highest Consensus ROE. In this piece, we will look at where Targa Resources Corp. (NYSE:TRGP) ranks in the list. As the fourth quarter of 2024 settles in, the narrative surrounding stocks on Wall Street is starting to shift. This is unsurprising since the beginning of the Federal Reserve’s interest rate cycles stands to change economic conditions in America. These will naturally affect businesses, and cyclical stocks along with financials should see an improved outlook. For instance, consider two reports by investment bank Morgan Stanley. One of these was released before the interest rate cut, and it covered the bank’s thoughts about the stock market and the US economy for September. The other came in October, after the rate cut. In its September report, MS laid out three scenarios for the flagship S&P index’s performance for the rest of this year. The best case scenario posits that the index would close at 5,650 points in the near term, while the “attractive” and “fair” scenarios predict a closing of 5,200 and 5,350 points, respectively. Yet, the market has outperformed even the best scenario, as its recent reading is 5,764. READ ALSO 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock The bank also shares that inflation is finally dropping in America. This fact is explained through the S&P’s second quarter earnings performance. In fact, the shifting inflationary trends have set new highs for a decade when we consider sales and earnings surprises for the index according to MS. Its data shows that when inflation was soaring in Q4 2022, the net of positive and negative EPS surprises stood in lowest quintile since businesses struggled with costs. This was despite the fact that during the same time period the net of positive and negative revenue surprises was in the 70% percentile. However, now that inflation has dropped, data for the second quarter earnings season shows that the EPS surprise was in the uppermost quintile (above 80%) while the revenue surprise had dropped to roughly 35%. This data covers the past ten years, and as a result, it illustrates the momentous shifts that the market is undergoing right now. Since interest rates are the hottest topic on Wall Street, MS also commented on its expectations for them. At the September start, the bank posited that markets were expecting 100 basis points of cuts by 2024 end. The bank shared that it thought “this looks aggressive unless the U.S. economy has a hard landing, but this is not our base case.” With September’s 50 basis points cut out of the way, these expectations have remained unchanged as the CME Fed Watch Tool shows that for the Fed’s November and December meetings, the market has set the probabilities for a 25 basis point cut in each at 85.5% and 82.1%, respectively.

Consensus ROE: 24% Number of Hedge Fund Investors in Q2 2024: 39 Targa Resources Corp. (NYSE:TRGP) is a Texas based natural gas infrastructure company. On the surface, this would imply that the firm has struggled this year as dropping natural gas prices have led to lower gas output and consequently lower demand for natural gas and associated infrastructure. However, in reality, Targa Resources Corp. (NYSE:TRGP)’s shares are up a cool 88% year to date which suggests that something else is brewing under the hood. We don’t have to look too far to find out what this is, as the firm has benefited from its presence in America’s hottest oil producing region, the Permian Basin. Targa Resources Corp. (NYSE:TRGP)’s presence in the Permian has allowed it to benefit from a growth in gas production there. Permian accounted for 5.8% of America’s gas production in 2011, and in 2022, its share jumped to 18.6%. Targa Resources Corp. (NYSE:TRGP) also benefits from the fact that it operates in the gas marketing business. This enables it to avoid supply chain bullwhips to an extent and gauge the demand for gas early on to ensure it does not over or under invest in capacity. Since Permian is quite important to Targa Resources Corp. (NYSE:TRGP)’s operations, here’s what management had to say about it during the Q2 2024 earnings call: “Activity in the Permian remains very strong, supporting our view of continued long-term growth from the basin. Our Permian volumes during the second quarter increased about 275 million cubic feet per day over the first quarter, which is a full plant. And year-over-year, our volumes in the Permian are up more than 600 million cubic feet per day. And currently, our volumes in the Permian are up another 200 million cubic feet per day compared to the second quarter. We expected strong growth from our Permian assets, but the growth we have seen this year has exceeded our expectations. We now expect low double-digit percentage volume growth this year, which sets us up well for meaningful growth in 2025 and beyond. This higher growth rate is driving incremental EBITDA and requiring additional growth capital investment. These volumes are core to our business, and we benefit across the integrated NGL value chain, driving higher margins into our downstream business and generating strong ROIC. Given higher-than-anticipated Permian volumes and an outlook for continued strong activity across our Midland and Delaware footprint, we announced our next two plants in the Permian, one in the Midland Basin and another in the Delaware Basin. Some spending for these plans was included in the forecast we provided back in February, but the timing and cadence of spending has accelerated.” Overall TRGP ranks 14th on our list of stocks with the highest consensus ROE according to Goldman Sachs. While we acknowledge the potential of TRGP as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TRGP but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: ECB officials urge Bitcoin latecomers, non-holders to oppose Bitcoin and advocate for legislation against it
URL: https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-wealth-redistribution-ecb/
Time Published: 2024-10-19T19:54:20Z
Full Content:
Share this article Those who have been late to Bitcoin or don’t own the coin have good reasons to oppose it and advocate legislation to protect themselves from its negative consequences of wealth redistribution, according to a recent analysis authored by ECB officials Ulrich Bindseil and Jürgen Schaff. The authors, who said Bitcoin’s February price rally was driven by price manipulation in an earlier report, claim Bitcoin has shifted from its original vision as a decentralized payment system to primarily an investment asset. The argument is backed by the growing support for Bitcoin from high-profile figures like BlackRock CEO Larry Fink or Galaxy Digital’s founder Mike Novogratz, who view Bitcoin as a pure investment asset. Their perspective is that Bitcoin’s limited supply and growing demand will drive its price up, similar to gold. However, ECB officials assert that Bitcoin’s limited supply doesn’t guarantee sustained price increases, contrary to popular belief among crypto supporters. “There are countless assets on earth with a limited or finite supply, and for none of them the notion that they can sustain an ever-increasing valuation over the long term, regardless of the services or benefits they provide to society, is particularly plausible,” the report states. “Proponents of the Bitcoin investment perspective ignore the fact that “scarcity” describes the relationship between supply and demand. A limited, finite supply does not equate to scarcity. In the context of Bitcoin with its limited and fixed supply the non-economic term “rarity” seems more appropriate. If supply is fixed, the price becomes exclusively dependent on demand. And if the demand were to disappear, the price would be zero,” it says. The authors warn that even in a scenario where Bitcoin’s value continues to rise, it could lead to negative economic consequences if not justified by the underlying fundamentals. They argue that Bitcoin doesn’t enhance the economy’s productive capacity, and any wealth generated by Bitcoin holders comes at the expense of others in society. “This redistribution of wealth and purchasing power is unlikely to occur without detrimental consequences for society,” the report claims. “Early adopters have a vested interest in promoting Bitcoin values to redistribute wealth and consumption from latecomers to themselves, maybe without being conscious of the redistributive nature of their vision,” it states. “In any case current non-holders should realize that they have compelling reasons to oppose Bitcoin and advocate for legislation against it, aiming to prevent Bitcoin prices from rising or to see Bitcoin disappear altogether. Latecomers and non-holders and their political representatives should emphasize that the idea of Bitcoin as an investment relies on redistribution at their expense,” it adds. The authors also warn that failing to do so could lead to electoral outcomes favoring politicians who support pro-Bitcoin policies, which could exacerbate wealth inequality and societal divisions by promoting a system that benefits early adopters while disadvantaging latecomers and non-holders. It’s not the first time ECB officials have shown their skepticism towards Bitcoin. As Crypto Briefing reported, ECB officials previously likened the approval of US Bitcoin ETFs to the ‘Naked Emperor’s New Clothes.’ The ECB faced social backlash as soon as the paper surfaced. Wall Street veteran Max Keiser criticized the paper for making false claims about Bitcoin’s original purpose. The @ecb makes a rookie mistake by claiming Bitcoin originated as a payment means. This is false. The word ‘Cash’ in the White Paper refers to money, as in Gold, not fiat currency. Bitcoin has always been digital Gold. Satoshi makes this clear in subsequent posts & messages. pic.twitter.com/qEMhoNDWpE — Max Keiser (@maxkeiser) October 19, 2024 Blockstream advisor Tuur Demeester, who first brought the paper to public attention, believes the ECB’s paper is “a true declaration of war” and that authorities will use it to justify harsh taxes or bans on Bitcoin. Demeester warns that the paper could have serious consequences for Bitcoin and its supporters, urging holders to take action to protect the rights of individuals to hold Bitcoin. 1/ This new paper is a true declaration of war: the ECB claims that early #bitcoin adopters steal economic value from latecomers. I strongly believe authorities will use this luddite argument to enact harsh taxes or bans. Check 🧵 for why: pic.twitter.com/qg31YenTSC — Tuur Demeester (@TuurDemeester) October 19, 2024 Following critical remarks by the ECB in February, Bitcoin established a new record high in mid-March. After the rally, Bitcoin experienced price corrections but it remains solid above $45,000. Bitcoin is currently trading at around $68,100, up over 60% year-to-date, per TradingView.

Title: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Unveils New AI Processors at Advancing AI 2024 Event, Faces Competition from Nvidia’s Blackwell Chips Amid Mixed Analyst Reactions

We recently compiled a list of the 20 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against the other trending AI stocks. Joining CNBC’s Squawk Box to discuss the latest market trends, Mary Ann Bartels of Sanctuary Wealth remains bullish on 2024, expecting the S&P 500 to hit 6,000 by year-end. As the Fed recalibrates to an easier monetary policy and corporate profits continue to grow, the chief investment strategist believes the market will maintain its rally as we approach November and December. As of today, the S&P is around 3% shy of hitting 6,000. This is only eight months after it eclipsed 5,000 for the first time. Monday, October 14 proved to be a new record for the S&P, marking the bull market's second anniversary. The milestone represents an impressive recovery over the last two years when stock prices surged despite ongoing recession concerns and elevated interest rates. S&P 500 reaching all-time highs comes amidst optimism on Wall Street as the third-quarter earnings season kicks in. With corporate earnings proving resilient amidst high rates and moderating inflation, and investors piling into stocks poised to benefit the most from the generative AI craze- the market sentiment remains bullish as traders anticipate strong financial results and continued growth in technology-driven sectors. Artificial Intelligence-linked stocks have been leading the S&P 500 and Nasdaq higher. On October 14, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both reached all-time highs, closing up 0.8% and 0.5%, respectively. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq gained 1% and approached a record of its own. Despite these recent gains, high valuations will seemingly pose a challenge for continued growth, with analysts noting that this could be a sign that the bull market may be nearing its end. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Unsexy AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Strategists also caution that moving forward, continued gains will depend on identifying sectors with strong earnings growth. As Artificial Intelligence is poised to significantly influence future market performance, the focus will shift to AI's impact on profitability across various industries. According to Citi equity strategist Scott Chronert, for AI to continue driving market gains, “you’ve got to have more companies delivering on the AI promise via margins and profitability metrics.” At the same time, it is also true that ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, upcoming US presidential elections, and natural disasters may pose risks to the market’s climb. Nevertheless, ongoing AI innovation and a resilient economy are still in support of further gains. In light of this, Solita Marcelli, Chief Investment Officer for Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, further notes how third-quarter results could act as a catalyst for market gains as investors focus on tech fundamentals and AI. "We continue to expect increased volatility for technology stocks in the near term,” the note states. “However, we remain positive on the tech sector as well as the outlook for artificial intelligence (AI). Against this backdrop, we believe volatility should be utilized to build long-term AI exposure." According to the bank, October has historically been a turbulent month for tech stocks, citing how monthly realized volatility for the Nasdaq 100 over the past 40 years has been 26% in October, while other months have an average of 22%. Regardless, strong AI fundamentals and the upcoming earnings season will reaffirm positive growth trajectories. It is further stated that the overall AI semiconductor industry is expected to grow sharply, reaching $168 billion by the end of the year. Tech and AI companies are also anticipated to “beat and raise” expectations for the September quarter. Furthermore, the ongoing transition to smaller, more powerful AI chips will drive significant performance improvements, fueling further investment in the sector.

Our Methodology For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close up of a complex looking PCB board with several intergrated semiconductor parts. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 108 Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is an American multinational corporation operating as a semiconductor company worldwide. The company is trying to establish itself as a key player in AI-powered personal computers (AIPCs), driving innovation in hardware to support advanced, next-generation applications. By integrating technology across CPUs, GPUs, and NPUs, it strives to create a strong ecosystem that supports the development of powerful AI applications. AMD held its Advancing AI 2024 event on October 10, 2024. At its AI event in San Francisco, AMD revealed its latest AI data center processors and new PC and server chips. In particular, the MI325X chip, built on the same architecture as the MI300X, incorporates a new memory variant designed to accelerate AI-related tasks. Vendors like Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) are expected to begin shipping AMD's new AI chip to customers in Q1 2025. AMD aims to use the chip to compete with Nvidia's Blackwell AI chips. AMD also plans to launch its next-gen MI2350 chips that will be more powerful than the MI325 series chips. Regardless, the stock’s share ended the day down by 4% following the AI event. As per Bernstein Research analysts, its GPU faces a “Zero challenge” against Nvidia's upcoming Blackwell chip. "Even the company's MI350X tease shows raw performance that, while on par with Blackwell on paper, arrives a year later, just in time to compete against Nvidia's next offerings. Hence we do not see even AMD's accelerated road map closing the competitive gap." - Bernstein Research analysts. Vivek Arya, research analyst at Bank of America Securities, further notes how there is "no near-term catalyst to change the dynamic" between the company and its chip rivals. "Training performance seems 1 year behind Blackwell (on par with H200) while inferencing is only slightly better”. -Vivek Arya On the other hand, Jefferies and Bank of America both maintained Buy ratings for the stock as of Friday (October 11), with price targets of $190 and $180, respectively, while 13 of 17 analysts tracked by Visible Alpha also rated it a "buy," with a consensus target of $192.13. In other news, the US is weighing on capping exports of AI chips from both Nvidia and AMD on a country-specific basis. This move is going to limit some countries’ artificial intelligence capabilities. Officials are particularly focused on Persian Gulf countries, and discussions are still in the early and fluid stages, but interest in the policy has increased recently. Last month, Commerce Department officials introduced these regulations, with more rules expected in the future. Overall AMD ranks 5th on our list of the trending AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

This company provides the world’s leading chipmakers with the power to mass-produce patterns on silicon, thereby helping them make their chips faster, smaller, and greener. In a recent turn of events, this tech company and key supplier of chip-making equipment accidentally published its Q3 earnings report a day early on Tuesday, October 15th. Following the accidental release, ASML stock plunged 16% on the back of weaker-than-expected bookings as well as a reduced sales forecast for 2025. While the Dutch company posted strong third-quarter results, they were dampened by lower-than-expected net bookings of €2.6 billion, falling short of forecasts that ranged between €4 billion and €6 billion. "ASML's fat finger error isn't cause for concern in itself, but the content of the release didn't make comforting reading for investors”. -Derren Nathan, head of equity research, Hargreaves Lansdown. ASML's reduced 2025 net sales guidance, driven by delays in EUV demand, alarmed investors and shook the market. “While there continue to be strong developments and upside potential in AI, other market segments are taking longer to recover. It now appears the recovery is more gradual than previously expected.

Title: SCHD: Split or Not, This Is a Strong Dividend ETF
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/schd-split-not-strong-dividend-181846209.html
Time Published: 2024-10-19T18:18:46Z
Full Content:
The Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) is one of the most popular dividend ETFs in the market today with a massive $63.7 billion in assets under management (AUM). The fund recently made some waves by executing a 3-for-1 split which went into effect on October 10th. We’ll discuss the rationale and details regarding the share split in this article. But more importantly, we’ll evaluate the merits of holding SCHD in an investment portfolio. I’m bullish on this well-known dividend ETF based on the strength of its attractive yield, its diversified portfolio of highly-rated dividend stocks, and an ultra-low expense ratio. According to fund sponsor Charles Schwab, SCHD’s strategy is simply to invest in an index called the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index. The index is “focused on the quality and sustainability of dividends.” The fund also “invests in stocks selected for fundamental strength relative to their peers, based on financial ratios.” As one of the most popular dividend ETFs in the market, SCHD recently made some waves when it conducted a 3-for-1 stock split that went effective on October 10, 2024. It’s much more common for company stocks to split than ETFs, and here is a rare case where an exchange-traded fund has split. The split doesn’t have any fundamental impact on SCHD’s investment prospects. What’s occurred is that investors now own three shares of SCHD for every one share previously held, while the market price of the ETF is 1/3 the value it would be without the split. A share split has some minor benefits, such as the lower price per share making it easier for smaller investors to establish an investment. A stock split can also enhance liquidity. It may also trigger increased options activity on the ticker (an options contract consists of 100 shares). But with all that said, the outlook for SCHD stock should be no different now than if no split had taken place. Many popular stocks that have engaged in stock splits over the past year, like Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO), had share prices of well over $1,000 a share, making a split more meaningful. Those splits made it significantly more affordable for investors to buy a share, or one lot (100) of shares. SCHD, on the other hand, was trading at just under $85 per share before the split, so the need for a split seemed less apparent here. The ability to buy fractional shares on brokerages like Robinhood (HOOD) and others also mitigates the need for stock splits to some degree. Regardless, at the end of the day, this is the same solid dividend ETF with the same holdings it had prior to the share split. The SCHD ETF offers sound diversification to investors. It owns 100 stocks, and its top 10 holdings account for 41.0% of its assets. Below, you’ll find an overview of SCHD’s top 10 holdings from TipRanks’ holdings tool. As you can see, the fund owns a plethora of well-known dividend stocks, ranging from top holding Home Depot (HD), to BlackRock (BLK), to Lockheed Martin (LMT). In addition to being blue-chip dividend stocks, another thing that these top holdings have in common is that they offer strong Smart Scores. The Smart Score is a quantitative stock scoring system created by TipRanks. It gives stocks a score from one to 10, based on eight key market factors. The score is data-driven and does not involve any human interpretation. Impressively, eight stocks from SCHD’s top 10 holdings have Smart Scores of eight or better. The Smart Score system also rates SCHD itself favorably, giving it an Outperform-equivalent ETF Smart Score of 8. Beyond being top dividend stocks, another nice thing about SCHD’s holdings is that overall, they are fairly inexpensive. The ETF’s holdings currently have a price-to-earnings ratio of 17.6x. This is another reason I’m bullish on the ETF. While a 17.6x P/E ratio isn’t dirt cheap, it’s considerably more affordable than the broader market at a time when the S&P 500 has a price-to-earnings ratio of 24.7x. This means that SCHD and its holdings probably offer a bit more downside protection than the broader market, and potentially have a bit more room for upside from multiple expansion. The fund also carries a beta of 0.74. This means that SCHD’s share price is only about three-quarters as volatile as the broader market. This adds credence to SCHD’s defensive qualities (as discussed above in the valuation section) which can be attractive for investors seeking to avoid volatility. SCHD has generated solid returns for its shareholders over the years. As of September 30th, the ETF has produced a three-year annualized return of 8.2%, a five-year annualized return of 13.0%, and a 10-year annualized return of 11.7%. It’s worth noting that SCHD has lagged behind broad market funds like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) over each of these time frames (for reference, VOO has posted an annualized five-year return of 15.9%). That is likely attributable to the growth opportunities many non-dividend paying companies have available. SCHD’s underperformance against the S&P 500 index (SPX), and its tracking ETFs, comes at a time when many large-cap tech stocks with small (or no) dividends have powered the index. If we return to an environment where more value-oriented dividend stocks are favored again, SCHD could outperform the broad market. For example, SCHD has slightly outperformed VOO over the past three months in what has been a volatile time for tech stocks. Regardless of comparisons, double-digit returns over a 10-year time horizon, like SCHD has delivered, are nothing to scoff at. Furthermore, for investors who own a large number of high-flying tech stocks, SCHD could provide worthwhile diversification benefits. The SCHD ETF currently yields 3.4%. This is an attractive yield and more than double the current yield of the S&P 500. That’s pretty attractive. Furthermore, the fund has a track record of dividend consistency. SCHD has paid a dividend for 12 straight years, and increased its payout annually. The dividend payout has been growing at a solid 12% clip over the past five years, so investors can likely expect continued increases in payouts over time. Unless, of course, hard times hit Corporate America, forcing some companies to cut their dividend. SCHD charges a bargain-bin expense ratio of just 0.06%. This means that an investor with $10,000 in the fund will pay just $6 in fees over the course of a year. It’s hard to argue with this expense ratio; it’s less than the price of a fast-food lunch these days. The savings from a low-fee investment fund like SCHD can really add up over time. Assuming that the current expense ratio remains the same, and the fund returns 5% per year on an annualized basis going forward, an investor putting $10,000 into SCHD would pay just $77 in fees over the course of a decade. Turning to Wall Street, SCHD earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 54 Buys, 37 Holds, and 10 Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average SCHD stock price target of $30.16 implies about 5% upside potential from current levels. I’m bullish on SCHD based on its attractive 3.4% dividend yield, its diversified portfolio of highly-rated blue-chip dividend stocks, the relatively inexpensive valuation of these holdings, and the fund’s investor-friendly expense ratio. The recent 3-for-1 split was an interesting development but ultimately doesn’t change much for the ETF or its holders. The one downside of SCHD is that it has lagged the broader market over the years, despite posting respectable double-digit annualized returns. As noted above, some of SCHD’s underperformance versus the S&P 500 is due to the dominant performance of large-cap tech stocks, companies that don’t generally pay attractive dividends. SCHD stock could be serve a valuable purpose in an investor’s portfolio, by delivering strong dividend income and lower volatility. SCHD could also outperform should investors rotate away from growth and back toward value-oriented dividend stocks. Disclosure Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: SEC Approves Spot Bitcoin ETF Options Trading On NYSE, Cboe – Details
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/sec-approves-spot-bitcoin-etf-options-nyse-cboe/
Time Published: 2024-10-19T17:00:47Z

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has granted a go-ahead to the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Chicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe) to list options trading for several spot Bitcoin ETFs. This development comes amidst the massive inflows recorded by these Bitcoin ETFs in the past week. According to filings by the SEC, NYSE and Cboe have obtained permission to list and trade options on multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs. Based on NYSE’s proposed rule change, the US securities regulator has allowed the exchange to provide options trading for Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust BTC (BTC), and Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB). Meanwhile, Cboe has been greenlighted to list and trade options on the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) and the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB). Interestingly, both exchanges gained “accelerated approval” from the Commission which means authorization was granted before the usual 30-day public comment period on the proposed amendments had elapsed according to Section 19(b)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. However, an accelerated approval usually happens when the Commission decides that waiting for a full 30 days is not necessary for the public protection of market stability or there is a good cause to fast-track the process as in the case of NYSE and Cboe. Commenting on this development, Bloomberg Analyst Eric Balchumas has expressed no surprise although applauding the SEC’s decision. Balchunas said: They approved same thing for Nasdaq recently so not a big surprise but still good news as SEC was big hurdle. We hearing good things about the rest of process altho exact timeline for listing date still unclear. Before NYSE and Cboe, the SEC had approved Nasdaq to list and trade options on the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). This represents the first approval for spot Bitcoin ETF options trading and came nine months after application with the SEC. Options trading refers to buying and selling contracts that grant traders the right but not the obligation to buy or sell an asset e.g.ETF at a predetermined price, albeit within a specific time frame. With six of the active spots of Bitcoin ETFs eligible for options trading, investors in these institutional funds are exposed to new trading strategies in terms of hedging against volatility or evening leveraging on Bitcoin’s price movement. Bitwise executive Jeff Park sheds more light on these in what he calls “free leverage”. Park said: ETF options will have cross-margining capabilities in multi-asset portfolios, which single-asset exchanges like Derbit can never provide. Only spot ETF options can leverage your GLD, SPY, HYG ETFs, bonds, and cross-margin to achieve uncharted capital efficiency-the closest thing to free leverage. Ultimately, this will result in increased institutional interest in an already booming spot Bitcoin ETF market which boasts over $65 billion in total net assets in ten months of trading.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 20 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Coherent Corp. (NYSE:COHR) stands against the other trending AI stocks. Joining CNBC’s Squawk Box to discuss the latest market trends, Mary Ann Bartels of Sanctuary Wealth remains bullish on 2024, expecting the S&P 500 to hit 6,000 by year-end. As the Fed recalibrates to an easier monetary policy and corporate profits continue to grow, the chief investment strategist believes the market will maintain its rally as we approach November and December. As of today, the S&P is around 3% shy of hitting 6,000. This is only eight months after it eclipsed 5,000 for the first time. Monday, October 14 proved to be a new record for the S&P, marking the bull market's second anniversary. The milestone represents an impressive recovery over the last two years when stock prices surged despite ongoing recession concerns and elevated interest rates. S&P 500 reaching all-time highs comes amidst optimism on Wall Street as the third-quarter earnings season kicks in. With corporate earnings proving resilient amidst high rates and moderating inflation, and investors piling into stocks poised to benefit the most from the generative AI craze- the market sentiment remains bullish as traders anticipate strong financial results and continued growth in technology-driven sectors. Artificial Intelligence-linked stocks have been leading the S&P 500 and Nasdaq higher. On October 14, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both reached all-time highs, closing up 0.8% and 0.5%, respectively. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq gained 1% and approached a record of its own. Despite these recent gains, high valuations will seemingly pose a challenge for continued growth, with analysts noting that this could be a sign that the bull market may be nearing its end. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Unsexy AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Strategists also caution that moving forward, continued gains will depend on identifying sectors with strong earnings growth. As Artificial Intelligence is poised to significantly influence future market performance, the focus will shift to AI's impact on profitability across various industries. According to Citi equity strategist Scott Chronert, for AI to continue driving market gains, “you’ve got to have more companies delivering on the AI promise via margins and profitability metrics.” At the same time, it is also true that ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, upcoming US presidential elections, and natural disasters may pose risks to the market’s climb. Nevertheless, ongoing AI innovation and a resilient economy are still in support of further gains. In light of this, Solita Marcelli, Chief Investment Officer for Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, further notes how third-quarter results could act as a catalyst for market gains as investors focus on tech fundamentals and AI. "We continue to expect increased volatility for technology stocks in the near term,” the note states. “However, we remain positive on the tech sector as well as the outlook for artificial intelligence (AI). Against this backdrop, we believe volatility should be utilized to build long-term AI exposure." According to the bank, October has historically been a turbulent month for tech stocks, citing how monthly realized volatility for the Nasdaq 100 over the past 40 years has been 26% in October, while other months have an average of 22%. Regardless, strong AI fundamentals and the upcoming earnings season will reaffirm positive growth trajectories. It is further stated that the overall AI semiconductor industry is expected to grow sharply, reaching $168 billion by the end of the year. Tech and AI companies are also anticipated to “beat and raise” expectations for the September quarter. Furthermore, the ongoing transition to smaller, more powerful AI chips will drive significant performance improvements, fueling further investment in the sector.

Title: Goldman Sachs: Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) Is A Stock With High Consensus ROE
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-sachs-uber-technologies-inc-155809667.html
Time Published: 2024-10-19T15:58:09Z

We recently looked at Goldman Sachs’ Stocks With Highest Consensus Returns: 42 Stocks With The Highest Consensus ROE. In this piece, we will look at where Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) ranks in the list. As the fourth quarter of 2024 settles in, the narrative surrounding stocks on Wall Street is starting to shift. This is unsurprising since the beginning of the Federal Reserve’s interest rate cycles stands to change economic conditions in America. These will naturally affect businesses, and cyclical stocks along with financials should see an improved outlook. For instance, consider two reports by investment bank Morgan Stanley. One of these was released before the interest rate cut, and it covered the bank’s thoughts about the stock market and the US economy for September. The other came in October, after the rate cut. In its September report, MS laid out three scenarios for the flagship S&P index’s performance for the rest of this year. The best case scenario posits that the index would close at 5,650 points in the near term, while the “attractive” and “fair” scenarios predict a closing of 5,200 and 5,350 points, respectively. Yet, the market has outperformed even the best scenario, as its recent reading is 5,764. The bank also shares that inflation is finally dropping in America. This fact is explained through the S&P’s second quarter earnings performance. In fact, the shifting inflationary trends have set new highs for a decade when we consider sales and earnings surprises for the index according to MS. Its data shows that when inflation was soaring in Q4 2022, the net of positive and negative EPS surprises stood in lowest quintile since businesses struggled with costs. This was despite the fact that during the same time period the net of positive and negative revenue surprises was in the 70% percentile. However, now that inflation has dropped, data for the second quarter earnings season shows that the EPS surprise was in the uppermost quintile (above 80%) while the revenue surprise had dropped to roughly 35%. This data covers the past ten years, and as a result, it illustrates the momentous shifts that the market is undergoing right now. READ ALSO 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock Since interest rates are the hottest topic on Wall Street, MS also commented on its expectations for them. At the September start, the bank posited that markets were expecting 100 basis points of cuts by 2024 end. The bank shared that it thought “this looks aggressive unless the U.S. economy has a hard landing, but this is not our base case.” With September’s 50 basis points cut out of the way, these expectations have remained unchanged as the CME Fed Watch Tool shows that for the Fed’s November and December meetings, the market has set the probabilities for a 25 basis point cut in each at 85.5% and 82.1%, respectively. These cuts are important for determining the market’s direction, as MS’ data shows that when economic activity as measured by the ISM Manufacturing Index sat at ~67 in 2010, the S&P’s 12 month total return was 30%. Shifting gears to the October report, MS cautions that while historically equities have outperformed following the first Fed rate cut, elevated valuations, and “consensus forecasting of EPS acceleration rather than decline, equities upside after the first cut may prove more limited this cycle.” The bank’s key stock market insight from its October report comes through its comments about cyclical stocks, though. MS shares that as upward economic growth surprises softened from April through August, “sector and factor trends skewed defensive, consistent with softer economic growth.” However, this might not be the case moving forward, as shown by the Citi Global Economic Surprise Index. MS outlines that this index had bottomed out in August with a ~-25 reading, which had jumped to roughly -12 in September. This trend was mirrored in the difference between global cyclical and defensive sectors, with the reading also moving upward as the economic surprises jumped. These factors are key when we analyze Goldman Sachs’ list of stocks with the highest expected ROE since the bank believes that stock quality will be determined by economic growth and economic rates. The bank also recently upped its 2024 closing target for the S&P to 6,000 points. This was the fourth revision of its target and a sizeable increase from the previous estimate of 5,600 points. This increase was also accompanied by optimism for the index’s earnings. GS now believes that S&P’s 2025 earnings will sit at $268, for a 4.7% revision from the previous estimate of $256. Its 2024 estimate is unchanged, though, and its value of $241 implies that earnings next year will grow by 11.2%. As for the next 12 months, GS believes that the S&P will sit at 6,300 points, for an 8.9% growth over its recent value of 5,779. As MS’ data pointed out that EPS surprises are growing as inflation tames, Goldman is also of a similar view. This is because the bank’s chief US equity strategist David Kostin shares that the upward EPS revision is reflective of the fact that the “macro backdrop remains conducive to modest margin expansion, with prices charged outpacing input cost growth.” In a later note, the analyst outlined that “Over the past year, performance of several quality factors has tracked the broad trajectory of market views on growth and monetary policy.” Kostin added that “A positive jobs print could prompt some investors to rotate out of expensive ‘quality’ stocks into less-loved lower quality firms as the market would likely price lower odds of substantial labor market weakening.” Our Methodology To make our list of Goldman Sachs’ stocks with the highest consensus ROE, we used the bank’s latest list of 50 such stocks and chose those with a 5% or higher consensus ROE. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A senior manager studying a market index alongside a team of young stock market analysts. Consensus ROE: 45% Number of Hedge Fund Investors in Q2 2024: 145 Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) is the largest ride sharing services provider in the US. The firm has leveraged its online platform to provide additional services as well such as food delivery. In fact, along with being the largest ride sharing company, the firm is also the second biggest food delivery company in the US after DoorDash. As a result, Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) benefits from earning from multiple businesses. These also enable the firm to target high growth initiatives such as air taxis, autonomous ride sharing vehicles, and dedicated shuttles. Starting from air taxis, Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) has invested $125 million into Joby Aviation as of 2020. For autonomous vehicles and shuttles, the firm has teamed up with General Motors to create a robotaxi service, and in October, the firm started a pilot program in New York to ferry users between Midtown New York and LaGuardia Airport. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)’s existing market position means that it remains the preferred partner for autonomous vehicles, which could work in its favor down the road. RiverPark Advisors mentioned Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) in its Q1 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: “UBER remains the undisputed global leader in ride sharing, with a greater than 50% share in every major region in which it operates. The company is also a leader in food delivery, where it is number one or two in the more than 25 countries in which it operates. Moreover, after a history of losses, the company is now profitable, delivering expanding margins and substantial free cash flow. We view UBER as more than a ride sharing and food delivery service; we also see it as a global mobility platform with 142 million users (by comparison, Amazon Prime has 200 million members) and the ability to penetrate new markets of on-demand services, such as package and grocery delivery, travel, and hourly worker staffing. Given its $5.4 billion of unrestricted cash and $4.8 billion of investments, the company today has an enterprise value of $165 billion, indicating that UBER trades at 21x our estimates of next year’s free cash flow.” Overall UBER ranks 5th on our list of stocks with the highest consensus ROE according to Goldman Sachs. While we acknowledge the potential of UBER as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than UBER but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Since interest rates are the hottest topic on Wall Street, MS also commented on its expectations for them. At the September start, the bank posited that markets were expecting 100 basis points of cuts by 2024 end. The bank shared that it thought “this looks aggressive unless the U.S. economy has a hard landing, but this is not our base case.” With September’s 50 basis points cut out of the way, these expectations have remained unchanged as the CME Fed Watch Tool shows that for the Fed’s November and December meetings, the market has set the probabilities for a 25 basis point cut in each at 85.5% and 82.1%, respectively. These cuts are important for determining the market’s direction, as MS’ data shows that when economic activity as measured by the ISM Manufacturing Index sat at ~67 in 2010, the S&P’s 12 month total return was 30%. Shifting gears to the October report, MS cautions that while historically equities have outperformed following the first Fed rate cut, elevated valuations, and “consensus forecasting of EPS acceleration rather than decline, equities upside after the first cut may prove more limited this cycle.” The bank’s key stock market insight from its October report comes through its comments about cyclical stocks, though. MS shares that as upward economic growth surprises softened from April through August, “sector and factor trends skewed defensive, consistent with softer economic growth.” However, this might not be the case moving forward, as shown by the Citi Global Economic Surprise Index. MS outlines that this index had bottomed out in August with a ~-25 reading, which had jumped to roughly -12 in September. This trend was mirrored in the difference between global cyclical and defensive sectors, with the reading also moving upward as the economic surprises jumped. These factors are key when we analyze Goldman Sachs’ list of stocks with the highest expected ROE since the bank believes that stock quality will be determined by economic growth and economic rates. The bank also recently upped its 2024 closing target for the S&P to 6,000 points. This was the fourth revision of its target and a sizeable increase from the previous estimate of 5,600 points. This increase was also accompanied by optimism for the index’s earnings. GS now believes that S&P’s 2025 earnings will sit at $268, for a 4.7% revision from the previous estimate of $256. Its 2024 estimate is unchanged, though, and its value of $241 implies that earnings next year will grow by 11.2%. As for the next 12 months, GS believes that the S&P will sit at 6,300 points, for an 8.9% growth over its recent value of 5,779. As MS’ data pointed out that EPS surprises are growing as inflation tames, Goldman is also of a similar view. This is because the bank’s chief US equity strategist David Kostin shares that the upward EPS revision is reflective of the fact that the “macro backdrop remains conducive to modest margin expansion, with prices charged outpacing input cost growth.” In a later note, the analyst outlined that “Over the past year, performance of several quality factors has tracked the broad trajectory of market views on growth and monetary policy.” Kostin added that “A positive jobs print could prompt some investors to rotate out of expensive ‘quality’ stocks into less-loved lower quality firms as the market would likely price lower odds of substantial labor market weakening.” Our Methodology To make our list of Goldman Sachs’ stocks with the highest consensus ROE, we used the bank’s latest list of 50 such stocks and chose those with a 5% or higher consensus ROE. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A senior manager studying a market index alongside a team of young stock market analysts. Consensus ROE: 5% Number of Hedge Fund Investors in Q2 2024: 85 Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is the dominant player in the global electric vehicle industry. Along with EVs, the firm also makes other products such as energy storage equipment to enable building owners to rely on solar energy for their power. However, 84% of Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s revenue comes from electric vehicles, which makes the stock vulnerable to downswings in the cyclical product category. This has also been the case lately, with the stock down 3% year to date and 8.6% over the past year. The drops are due to a slowdown in the EV industry stemming from high interest rates and weakening demand. Additionally, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) has long enjoyed the status of being one of the few large scale EV makers in the world. However, with new companies entering the market, the firm will have to leverage existing economies of scale to compete on the cost front – a strategy that could erode margins and affect profitability. During this critical period, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s scale, as is evident by its 1.85 million EV production capacity in 2023, its sizeable data repository of 1.3 billion miles for training autonomous systems, and a semi diversified business that saw energy storage revenue double to $3 billion in Q2 should come to the firm’s aid. However, Goldman was of mixed mind after Tesla’s We, Robot event as it criticized a lack of detail for business plans but sounded optimistic about the humanoid robot prototype Optimus. Baron Funds mentioned Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: “As discussed in the Fund’s prior shareholder letter, the fears about Tesla’s products were misplaced. Instead of the company being exclusively dependent on limited vehicle models and software advancement, the company announced it will more rapidly introduce products that appeal to a wider audience. It also demonstrated that its price reductions were the result of efficiencies rather than only to spur demand. Margins exceeded expectations. And the company’s integration of its hardware with proprietary AI software should facilitate full self-driving capabilities and subsequent new revenue streams. This integration of hardware with software creates a dynamic growth company as it more fully explores its potential with Optimus, humanoid robotics. The combination of these catalysts resulted in Tesla’s stock increasing meaningfully and rapidly in the second half of the quarter. This stock price momentum has continued into the next period” Overall TSLA ranks 41st on our list of stocks with the highest consensus ROE according to Goldman Sachs. While we acknowledge the potential of TSLA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TSLA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Arm Holdings plc (ARM) Teams Up with Industry Leaders to Launch Advanced AI CPU Chiplet Platform for Cloud and HPC Applications

We recently compiled a list of the 20 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Arm Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM) stands against the other trending AI stocks. Joining CNBC’s Squawk Box to discuss the latest market trends, Mary Ann Bartels of Sanctuary Wealth remains bullish on 2024, expecting the S&P 500 to hit 6,000 by year-end. As the Fed recalibrates to an easier monetary policy and corporate profits continue to grow, the chief investment strategist believes the market will maintain its rally as we approach November and December. As of today, the S&P is around 3% shy of hitting 6,000. This is only eight months after it eclipsed 5,000 for the first time. Monday, October 14 proved to be a new record for the S&P, marking the bull market's second anniversary. The milestone represents an impressive recovery over the last two years when stock prices surged despite ongoing recession concerns and elevated interest rates. S&P 500 reaching all-time highs comes amidst optimism on Wall Street as the third-quarter earnings season kicks in. With corporate earnings proving resilient amidst high rates and moderating inflation, and investors piling into stocks poised to benefit the most from the generative AI craze- the market sentiment remains bullish as traders anticipate strong financial results and continued growth in technology-driven sectors. Artificial Intelligence-linked stocks have been leading the S&P 500 and Nasdaq higher. On October 14, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both reached all-time highs, closing up 0.8% and 0.5%, respectively. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq gained 1% and approached a record of its own. Despite these recent gains, high valuations will seemingly pose a challenge for continued growth, with analysts noting that this could be a sign that the bull market may be nearing its end. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Unsexy AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Strategists also caution that moving forward, continued gains will depend on identifying sectors with strong earnings growth. As Artificial Intelligence is poised to significantly influence future market performance, the focus will shift to AI's impact on profitability across various industries. According to Citi equity strategist Scott Chronert, for AI to continue driving market gains, “you’ve got to have more companies delivering on the AI promise via margins and profitability metrics.” At the same time, it is also true that ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, upcoming US presidential elections, and natural disasters may pose risks to the market’s climb. Nevertheless, ongoing AI innovation and a resilient economy are still in support of further gains. In light of this, Solita Marcelli, Chief Investment Officer for Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, further notes how third-quarter results could act as a catalyst for market gains as investors focus on tech fundamentals and AI. "We continue to expect increased volatility for technology stocks in the near term,” the note states. “However, we remain positive on the tech sector as well as the outlook for artificial intelligence (AI). Against this backdrop, we believe volatility should be utilized to build long-term AI exposure." According to the bank, October has historically been a turbulent month for tech stocks, citing how monthly realized volatility for the Nasdaq 100 over the past 40 years has been 26% in October, while other months have an average of 22%. Regardless, strong AI fundamentals and the upcoming earnings season will reaffirm positive growth trajectories. It is further stated that the overall AI semiconductor industry is expected to grow sharply, reaching $168 billion by the end of the year. Tech and AI companies are also anticipated to “beat and raise” expectations for the September quarter. Furthermore, the ongoing transition to smaller, more powerful AI chips will drive significant performance improvements, fueling further investment in the sector.

Title: BlackRock in Talks With Crypto Exchanges About Using Its BUIDL Token As Derivatives Collateral: Report
URL: https://dailyhodl.com/2024/10/19/blackrock-in-talks-with-crypto-exchanges-about-using-its-buidl-token-as-derivatives-collateral-report/
Time Published: 2024-10-19T15:30:17Z

Asset management titan BlackRock is reportedly in talks with numerous crypto exchange platforms about using its proprietary token BUIDL as collateral for derivatives contracts. According to a new report by Bloomberg, anonymous people familiar with the matter say the world’s largest asset manager is exploring the idea of utilizing BUIDL – the crypto asset related to the firm’s tokenized mutual fund – as collateral for trading derivatives contracts. BUIDL, which launched in March of this year and stands for BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, is a tokenized money-market fund designed to offer a stable value of $1 per token built on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain that offers blue-chip traders yields. Bloomberg says the crypto exchanges BlackRock is in talks with include Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by volume, as well as OKX and Deribit. Previously, it was reported that the fund invests in cash, US Treasury Bills, and repurchase agreements and sends dividends directly to investors’ wallets as new tokens every month. As stated by Robert Mitchnick, BlackRock’s head of digital assets, in a press release issued by Securitize, BlackRock’s brokerage partner, “[BUIDL] is the latest progression of our digital assets strategy. We are focused on developing solutions in the digital assets space that help solve real problems for our clients.” In April, stablecoin issuer Circle launched a new smart contract function that permits holders of BUIDL to convert their tokens into USDC. At the time, Circle chief executive Jeremy Allaire said that the new functionality would allow “investors to move out of tokenized assets at speed, lowering costs and removing friction.” Generated Image: Midjourney Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

Title: BlackRock Seeks To Push BUIDL As Derivative Collateral In Crypto Market – Details
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-push-buidl-crypto-derivative-collateral/
Time Published: 2024-10-19T15:00:28Z
Full Content:
The world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, aims to expand its foray in the digital asset industry following the successful launch of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in 2024. In a new venture, the American asset manager is attempting to push the adoption of its money-market token BUIDL as a collateral asset in the crypto derivative market. According to a Friday report by Bloomberg, BlackRock has begun marketing BUIDL as collateral in the crypto derivative market. For context, BUIDL – which stands for BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund – is a tokenized fund issued on the Ethereum blockchain offering institutional investors access to achieving US dollar yields. Similar to stablecoins, BUIDL is pegged to a stable value of $1 per unit and invests in assets such as US dollars, US treasury bills, and repurchase agreements. Following its launch in March, BUIDL has experienced remarkable growth amassing $550 million in AUM to become the largest tokenized fund in the market. In order to facilitate further growth of BUIDL, Bloomberg states that BlackRock in conjunction with its broker Securitize has begun discussions with major exchanges such as Binance, OKX, and Deribit to introduce the money-market token as a collateral asset for derivative trading on their respective platforms. BlackRock will aim to charge traders a management fee of 0.5% in line with its current standard policy. However, the use of BUIDL is only restricted to eligible institutional investors with a minimum investment quota of $5 million. Currently, crypto prime brokers such as FalconX and Hidden Road have already authorized their customers to use BUIDL as a collateral asset for trading. However, a potential entry into the derivatives market of powerhouse exchanges such as Binance and OKX presents a significant opportunity to exponentially increase the market influence of the tokenized find. In launching BUIDL in the crypto derivative trading, BlackRock will experience powerful opposition from Tether’s USDT which ranks as the most common asset for collateral in the crypto derivative market. USDT is the world’s largest stablecoin and third-largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $120 billion. At present, there are no confirmative comments from BlackRock or the mentioned crypto exchanges on any planned introduction of BUIDL in crypto derivative trading. However, the successful execution of this initiative would represent another outstanding milestone in the investment firm’s digital asset campaign. BlackRock already presents the largest spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs with respective net assets of $25.79 billion and $1.26 billion according to data from SoSoValue. By securing a collateral asset in the crypto derivative market, which produced nearly three-quarters of crypto trading volume in September, BlackRock could expand its reach in the digital asset industry.

Title: Majority of children on spinal waiting list will have surgery or date by end of year - Donnelly
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/health/2024/10/19/majority-of-children-on-spinal-waiting-list-will-have-surgery-or-date-by-end-of-year-donnelly/
Time Published: 2024-10-19T10:20:37Z
Full Content:
The “majority” of 138 children who are currently on an “active” waiting list for spinal surgery will have had their surgery performed or will have a date for their surgery before the end of 2024, according to Minister for Health, Stephen Donnelly. A spokeswoman for the health minister said: “The Minister for Health expects the majority of those currently on the active waiting list to have received a date for surgery / have had their surgery before the end of the year.” The Minister’s office was asked to clarify the position following comments made by Limerick Fianna Fáil TD Niall Collins, who said that the Minister told him that the waiting list would be reduced by at least 100 patients by the end of this year, leaving 38 patients on the active list. When asked for clarity on the figures Minister Donnelly’s office replied that “as of September 27th, 362 spinal surgeries have been completed this year to date”. It explained that while “there are currently 138 children actively waiting for a date for their surgery”, a total of “38 children are currently confirmed for outsourced initiatives in Ireland and abroad”, which included “16 children (who) have received a date to come in for surgery at the National Orthopaedic Hospital Cappagh”. According to CHI newly published figures, there were 248 children on the spinal surgery waiting list as of September 27th, including 138 patients who were ready for surgery and waiting for a date; 18 patients who were assigned a surgery date; 35 patients who had “an initial episode of care” and required a further procedure; and 57 patients who were suspended from the waiting list due to clinical reasons (11 patients), personal reasons (8 patients), or patients who were confirmed to have their surgery in a non CHI hospital under a CHI initiative (38 patients). “A number of international outsourcing initiatives have been finalised for children waiting on spinal surgeries. While this option is not suitable for all children waiting on spinal surgeries, dozens of children and families will be able to avail of the option to get their surgery abroad - They include Morgan Stanley Children’s Hospital in New York and Great Ormond Street Hospital in London,” Minister Donnelly’s office. “National outsourcing of spinal patients to Blackrock Clinic and the National Orthopaedic Hospital Cappagh is already in progress.” The Minister’s office said: “CHI has implemented an extended operating theatre day and a ring-fenced theatre for spinal surgery to increase the number of procedures that are being carried out”. A Paediatric Spinal Taskforce, set up by the health minister, is being chaired by senior counsel Mark Connaughton, and includes patient advocacy groups, representatives from CHI, the HSE, the Ombudsman for Children, and the Department of Health. © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Reality bites: Is Generation X in denial about its own impending retirement?
URL: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/10/19/generation-x-retirement-denial/75731069007/
Time Published: 2024-10-19T09:09:24Z
Full Content:
Is Generation X in denial about its own impending retirement? Gen X, born between 1965 and 1980, will be next to retire after the baby boom. It’s a generation largely defined by financial uncertainty: Generation X was the first to cope without ubiquitous workplace pensions, relying instead on a new savings tool called the 401(k). The Great Recession of 2008 stands as the generation’s defining economic event. Now, with the oldest Gen Xers pushing 60, the cohort may not be ready for its next life stage. A Wealth Watch survey from insurer New York Life is one of several recent reports that portray much of Generation X as woefully unprepared for their looming retirement. Fewer than half of Generation X, or 46%, are “actively planning for retirement,” New York Life found, even as they approach the milestone. Most of Generation X, or 70%, think they will retire “later than expected,” the survey found, “or not at all.” Only one-quarter of Gen-Xers believe they will retire on time. The survey, released in September, reached 2,230 adults. “There are a whole lot of Gen Xers who are finding themselves resigned to the fact that they’re basically going to be working forever,” said Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst at LendingTree, the personal finance site. Generation X’s retirement fears are not unwarranted. Gen Xers ages 45 to 54 had a median net worth of about $247,000 in 2022, according to the federal Survey of Consumer Finances. That’s less money than baby boomers had at the same age. Boomers in the 45-54 age group had a median net worth of about $265,000 in 2007, after adjusting for inflation. The contrast suggests Generation X has struggled more than other age groups to recover from the Great Recession of 2008. “I think there’s this cumulative wear and tear of different circumstances Gen X has had throughout their lives,” said KC Boas, head of retirement thought leadership and marketing at BlackRock, the global investment firm. Many in Generation X entered the workforce around the time of the dot-com bubble, the tech-stock boom that went bust in 2000, sending the stock market tumbling. Several years later, many Gen Xers were in their prime earning years when the Great Recession hit. Every generation suffered in 2008, but economic research suggests Gen X suffered more than most. “Older generations were hit much harder, in some ways, because they had more to lose,” said Catherine Collinson, CEO of the nonprofit Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies. Late baby boomers, born between 1960 and 1965, were also in their top earning years when the Great Recession descended. Today, the “Beatlemania boomers” have much less retirement savings than Americans born in the 1950s or earlier. They and Gen X suffered a similar fate. Millennials, born between 1981 and 1996, have fared better. The millennial generation is in a stronger financial position now than Gen X was at the same age, according to a new LendingTree analysis. As of 2022, millennials had a median net worth of $84,941, LendingTree reports. Generation X had a lower net worth at the same age: $78,333, after adjusting for inflation. Millennials are also better-off financially than boomers were at the same age. But boomers are much more likely than Gen X or millennials to have workplace pensions, a guaranteed source of retirement income. Generation X entered the workforce as workplace pensions were fading, leaving most workers to build their own retirement savings with 401(k) plans and Individual Retirement Accounts. But 401(k) plans were few and far between in the early years. Partly for that reason, many Gen Xers got a late start in retirement saving. “This all happened without access to education and guidance,” said Jessica Ruggles, corporate vice president of financial wellness at New York Life. “It wasn’t until much later that we did things like auto-enrollment and auto-contribution,” innovations that encourage higher rates of retirement saving. Schulz, of LendingTree, is 52: a quintessential Gen Xer. He got his first real job around 1995, in his early 20s. “I didn’t even really think of retirement, or anything like that, at that age,” he said. The typical Gen Xer began saving for retirement at age 30, half a decade later than millennials, according to the Transamerica Center. Today, the median Gen X household has $93,000 in retirement savings: Not nearly enough, in the eyes of many retirement planners. As a result, Transamerica found, most Gen Xers plan to keep working in retirement. Those figures come from the 2024 Transamerica Retirement Survey of Workers, which reached 5,730 workers. Other retirement surveys concur that Generation X faces a unique struggle in preparing for retirement. Only 60% of Gen Xers feel “on track” for retirement, the lowest share of any generation, according to the 2024 BlackRock Read on Retirement report. Three-fifths of Gen Xers worry they will outlive their retirement savings, BlackRock found. Only two-fifths of Gen Xers use a financial adviser, the lowest rate of any generation. Generation X also seems to have a credit card problem. More than one Gen X cardholder in four, or 27%, have maxed out their credit, Bankrate reported on Thursday. Gen-Xers are more likely than millennials or boomers to have exhausted their credit, the survey found. The finding is worrisome, retirement experts say, because consumers should be paying down their debt as they approach retirement, not charging it up. The Bankrate survey covered 3,576 adults. Meet the 'Beatlemania boomers.'They face a looming retirement crisis But here’s some good news, at least from a retirement perspective: Generation X is spending less on discretionary purchases in 2024, Bank of America reports. “Discretionary” is a category that covers non-essentials. And discretionary spending among Gen Xers is down 2% in the year ended August, according to internal Bank of America card data, the biggest drop of any generation. At the same time, Gen X is investing a larger share of its paycheck than other generations, according to a September report from Bank of America Institute. “Bottom line, they’re spending less and they’re investing more,” said Joe Wadford, an economist at the Bank of America Institute. “It’s certainly a sign that Gen X is hopeful for the future. They think they will retire, and they think that in the future, those investments are going to pay off.”
