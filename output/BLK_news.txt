Traders place the odds of a rate cut at the next Federal Reserve meeting at over 90%, but not everyone is happy about the prospect of easy money. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. If you‚Äôre following the markets, you‚Äôll know the Federal Reserve is poised to cut interest rates next week to stimulate a lagging economy. While most crypto traders are jumping for joy at the thought of fresh liquidity entering the system, not everybody‚Äôs happy. The upcoming rate cut, according to some, could have a catastrophic effect on the global economy. Economist, investor, and everybody‚Äôs favorite goldbug Peter Schiff did not mince his words, calling a rate cut a ‚Äúhuge mistake‚Äù in a post shared on X. As crypto traders gear up for a potentially bullish period, Schiff warns of serious consequences that will gravely impact the economy. His commentary is blunt. He points to recent price moves in gold and silver as clear evidence that the rate cut is being telegraphed by the markets. Schiff wrote: ‚ÄúSilver just traded above $42. Gold is poised to break to a new record high. I think the precious metals are getting ready to melt up. This is an unmistakable market signal that the Fed‚Äôs upcoming rate cut is a huge mistake.‚Äù He argues that the decision will set off a string of cuts and a return to aggressive quantitative easing, potentially with ‚Äúdefinitive yield curve control.‚Äù Schiff claims the U.S. dollar could lose its reserve currency status as confidence in the Fed‚Äôs judgment wavers. Peter Schiff has long pushed the view that overly easy policy will stoke inflation and put the dollar at risk. He believes that today‚Äôs environment represents the Fed‚Äôs most damaging error yet. ‚ÄúEver since Alan Greenspan rescued the stock market after the 1987 crash, the Fed has made a series of increasingly bad monetary policy mistakes.‚Äù Risk-on asset traders welcome rate cuts with open arms. Lower interest rates flood markets with cheap capital and loosen financial conditions, which typically results in higher prices for volatile assets like crypto. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoins tend to rally as liquidity improves, triggering a wave of buying and bullish sentiment. The CME‚Äôs FedWatch tool shows market participants almost unanimously expect a cut (93.4%), with bets on both Bitcoin and altcoins accelerating into the meeting. Lower rates mean money can move out of safe havens and into riskier bets, which is another reason Schiff is opposed to the cut. In plain language: Traders want easy money. Recent cycles show crypto runs higher whenever the Fed loosens policy, and traders are already calling for a new bull market as expectations for rate cuts hit fever pitch. While Schiff sounds the alarm, many respected analysts, including teams at Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, and a 107-economist Reuters survey, see the rate cut as a necessary step to support the weakening labor market and prevent recession. Goldman‚Äôs chief economist expects a series of small cuts, noting softer employment data and muted inflation as justification for easing. Others warn that cutting rates too fast could actually push inflation higher or weaken the dollar, backing some of Schiff‚Äôs concerns. Jefferies strategist David Zervos suggested the Fed might need a deep 75 basis point cut, though he also cautioned that easy money could ultimately hurt by driving up prices and weakening currency fundamentals. The upcoming Fed rate cut is a flashpoint. Schiff says it risks disaster, spiraling cuts, runaway inflation, and a weaker dollar. Crypto traders, though, are celebrating the prospect of more easy money and the next phase in the bull run. The broader economist community remains split, weighing soft employment against inflation risk. Whether the Fed is making a ‚Äúhuge mistake‚Äù or a well-timed rescue, the next move will have a lasting impact in both traditional and crypto markets Christina is a web3 writer, editor, and content manager with a passion for technology and starting important conversations.

Title: 3 Reasons The Growth Of DeFi Is Lagging Among Institutions
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/09/13/3-reasons-the-growth-of-defi-is-lagging-among-institutions/
Time Published: 2025-09-13T16:47:17Z

BySean Stein Smith, Contributor. Even as the cryptoasset ecosystem grows, market capitalizations remain near all-time-highs, and TradFi institutions continue to deploy an array of products and services one subset of the crypto ecosystem is still looking to recover 2021 and 2022 excitement: decentralized finance. This may come as a surprise to some crypto-native investors, as the total value locked has risen to a new record of $130 billion according to research by DeFiLlama. These deposits, placed and managed in a blockchain or DeFi protocol have more than doubled since April, and reflect the overall shift in both policy directives and investor sentiment. Ironically enough the growth and deposits in the DeFi sector continue to trend toward centralization, with three (3) players dominating the space. Aave possess a TVL of more than $68 billion, which is the largest of any DeFi lending protocol, leverages a pool-based lending protocol, and in August launched an institutional platform allowing larger investors to participate. Morpho and JustLend round out the top players in the DeFi landscape, but both have substantially lower TVL‚Äôs and ‚Äì in some cases ‚Äì more limited offerings. In spite of these record levels of deposits, and positive tailwinds, institutional adoption and utilization of DeFi continues to lag. JPMorgan, itself one of the most innovative TradFi banks via its Kinexys (formerly Onyx) suite of on-chain products and services, has recently noted the disappointing progress for both DeFi and tokenized assets by institutions in the TradFi space. Notably, the bulk of the activity and growth in DeFi has come from retail and/or crypto-native institutions. Let‚Äôs take a look at a few reasons why DeFi, despite its growth and record deposits, still needs better regulation. A common issue that continues to stall wider utilization of DeFi across broader areas of the economy ‚Äì both crypto-native and TradFi ‚Äì are issues related to interoperability and liquidity across multiple chains. While the most common manifestation of this takes the form of differing valuations for some tokens when analyzed across chains, and this includes valuations for stablecoins, there are other issues that DeFi needs to address. Firstly, the traceability and transparency of transactions, tokens, and tokenized assets as they move across chains is something that will need to be standardized and improved upon to obtain more institutional adoption. Additionally, although consumers have been the primary drivers of this recent uptick in DeFi TVL, institutions of all kinds need to have absolute confidence that transactions, payments, and confirmations can occur as seamlessly as occur using current payment rails and options. Much like how bitcoin has achieved and maintained higher price levels, obtained policy victories, and generated increased interest once firms like Blackrock entered the space via spot ETF products, DeFi will need TradFi firms to embrace DeFi-first options to generate similar growth. An ongoing issue in the wider cryptoasset ecosystem, not limited to the DeFi space, is the still-evolving standards and best practices related to auditing and assurance connected to blockchain, cryptoassets, and the smart contracts that power many of the Layer 2, Web 3, and more innovative use cases that have deployed in the 2024-2025 timespan. With cybercriminals already having stolen over $2 billion in 2025, according to DeFiLlama, a 77% increase from 2024, the weaknesses of the DeFi ecosystem continue to prove lucrative for hackers and other criminal elements. While the smart contract space has certainly evolved substantially since initially introduced, with many organizations leveraging these applications, the fact remains that the standards, transparency, and auditability of smart contracts is a work in progress. This status provides several obstacles to institutional adoption of DeFi. First, if organizations cannot trust smart contracts ‚Äì or at least trust that issues can be remediated in a timely manner ‚Äì customers and regulators will not be on board either. Secondly, especially for publicly traded organizations, if auditability, record-keeping, and traceability remain questions, bodies such as the SEC (even under the new pro-crypto regime) will be hesitant to approve related projects. In short, the very smart contracts that power DeFi at the most important level continue to prove a point of weakness. Last but not least the DeFi sector ‚Äì even with nearly $200 billion in total value locked ‚Äì remains a miniscule fraction of the overall lending market and financial ecosystem. For contextual purposes, JP Morgan Chase reported daily payment processing volume of $10 trillion in a recent earnings release. Crypto and crypto-adjacent products and services have experienced significant growth, adoption, and acceptance since the last bear market kicked off by the collapse of FTX, but still are ‚Äì for all intents and purposes ‚Äì a fringe component of the financial world. To address this, in addition to the points raised above, are directly related to the ability of DeFi protocols to scale to meet customer demand as well as addressing the reliability, reversibility, and potential hackability of smart contracts underpinning the protocols. A critical component of this process will entail both working the TradFi financial sector as well as improving regulatory-mandated mechanisms such as KYC and AML safeguards. As policy continues to pivot and produce tailwinds versus headwinds it is reasonable to assume this will occur, but investors and policymakers should remain cautious before pushing for widespread utilization is the DeFi infrastructure is not yet prepared. DeFi continues to grow, but work remains to attract institutional buy-in.

WisdomTree has launched a new tokenized fund focusing on private credit. The new fund, called the WisdomTree Private Credit and Alternative Income Digital Fund (CRDT), tracks a basket of 35 publicly traded closed-end funds, business development companies, and real estate investment trusts, Bloomberg reports. It‚Äôs available with a minimum investment of just $25 and offers two-day redemption. WisdomTree, it‚Äôs worth adding, launched an ETF tracking the same benchmark in 2021, the WisdomTree Private Credit and Alternative Income Fund. Private credit, lending done outside traditional banks, has ballooned in recent years as investors chase yield-focused investment options. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really just about bringing the asset class to a whole universe of different investors,‚Äù said Will Peck, head of digital assets at WisdomTree. The firm has launched a number of tokenized investment vehicles so far, including ones offering exposure to money market funds, fixed income securities, and equities. The new fund joins a growing trend among Wall Street‚Äôs largest asset managers. BlackRock, for example, manages a $2 billion money market fund, while Fidelity‚Äôs tokenized money market fund recently rolled out on Ethereum. WisdomTree joins a broader trend. BlackRock‚Äôs tokenized $2 billion money market fund and experiments from Fidelity and VanEck suggest traditional finance is taking real-world asset tokenization seriously, even if it‚Äôs still small compared to the trillions in ETFs and mutual funds.

Title: Neuralink, Elon Musk, and the Race to Put Chips Into Our Brains

By Darren Loucaides T here‚Äôs a 3D hand on a black screen. J. Galen Buckwalter concentrates on the image, trying to move one of the virtual hand‚Äôs fingers ‚Äî with his mind. For more than 50 years, Buckwalter hasn‚Äôt felt his fingers after breaking his neck in an accident as a teenager. But today, thanks to a research lab at California Institute of Technology (Caltech) that implanted him with a brain computer interface (BCI), Buckwalter is a pioneer exploring the frontiers of brain science. Buckwalter only needed a couple of sessions to master the control of a computer cursor ‚Äî some participants needed much longer. Now he attempts to move two fingers and a thumb. A large blue dot slides back and forth over the virtual index finger as he tries to coax it to life. Eventually he can move all three digits ‚Äî and can actually feel the virtual fingers he‚Äôs trying to move. ‚ÄúThat was the ‚Äòholy shit‚Äô moment, that this really feels like my hand,‚Äù Buckwalter says with a grin in a video call. It may seem like a small step, but this was a giant leap for Buckwalter, 69, the self-proclaimed ‚Äúneuronaut.‚Äù The Caltech lab where Buckwalter is a participant is run by Richard Andersen, 74, one of the world‚Äôs foremost neuroscientists who has been working on implants for decades. His lab is currently studying five humans with long-term brain implants. These participants have moved objects with robotic arms, operated semi-autonomous cars as part of an experiment in collaboration with Ford, and even felt natural touch again. Brain implants are very much part of the popular imagination right now ‚Äî the hit show Severance fictionalizes a worst-case scenario for the technology ‚Äî and Elon Musk‚Äôs BCI company Neuralink has swallowed most of the news attention, like the videos of Neuralink‚Äôs participants playing video games and moving robotic arms. But Neuralink‚Äôs headline-grabbing work builds on the painstaking achievements of research labs like Caltech‚Äôs. ‚ÄúThe BCI companies of today are standing on the shoulders of academic giants who have been developing BCIs for decades,‚Äù says Rajesh Rao, co-director of the Center for Neurotechnology at the University of Washington. Editor‚Äôs picks The 250 Greatest Albums of the 21st Century So Far The 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time 100 Best Movies of the 21st Century Musk‚Äôs goal for his company also diverges from his academic forbearers. The world‚Äôs richest man is explicitly focused on ‚Äúenhancement‚Äù ‚Äî his sci-fi dream is to turn BCIs into mass products for able-bodied people, merging our brains with computers. While academic labs like Caltech are focused on better understanding the brain so they can help people with conditions like Buckwalter‚Äôs, Musk wants to give people superhuman vision and total recall: ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs extremely safe, and you can have superhuman abilities, and let‚Äôs say you can upload your memories, so you wouldn‚Äôt lose memories, then I think probably a lot of people would choose to have it,‚Äù he told podcaster Lex Fridman last year. ‚ÄúIt would supersede the cellphone, for example.‚Äù Neuralink‚Äôs staff has basically said that they don‚Äôt need to understand how the brain works to roll out this cyborg future. To those in the know, this seems short-sighted. ‚ÄúNew knowledge of how the brain works leads to more advanced neural prosthetics,‚Äù as Andersen says. Musk‚Äôs pushy approach also risks setting back this work at a crucial moment, according to others in the field.

But they point to ‚Äúcrazy pressure from the top,‚Äù while raising some of the same concerns highlighted in a 2020 STAT News investigation that reported a ‚Äúchaotic internal culture‚Äù and a Reuters 2023 report on ‚Äútensions inside Neuralink over development pace.‚Äù Neuralink and Musk did not respond to a detailed list of questions from Rolling Stone. Current individual employees also did not respond to requests for comment for this piece. With Musk‚Äôs recent cost-cutting role in government ‚Äî already linked to the firing of those in the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), including some staff overseeing Neuralink‚Äôs clinical trial applications ‚Äî there‚Äôs more attention on the company than ever, with some wondering if the guardrails have come off. IN JULY 2019, MUSK strode onstage in San Francisco wearing a suit with a white shirt, no tie, to make his first presentation about Neuralink. While the first human volunteers would be paralyzed patients, the ultimate goal was to avoid mankind being ‚Äúleft behind‚Äù by advancing tech, namely AI. ‚ÄúThis is going to sound pretty weird,‚Äù he said, shoulders hunched, but the objective was to achieve ‚Äúsymbiosis with artificial intelligence.‚Äù He added: ‚ÄúThis is extremely important.‚Äù The following year, in an interview with Joe Rogan, Musk made an even bigger claim: Implantees would be able to ‚Äúsave state‚Äù like in a video game, enabling someone to ‚Äúrestore that state into a biological being if you wanted to in the future.‚Äù Despite Musk‚Äôs interventions bringing the field an unprecedented level of prominence in the media, brain implants have been around for decades. In the 1960s, neurophysiologist Jos√© Delgado implanted bulls with wireless devices to stop them in their tracks as they charged toward him. In 1973, University of California in Los Angeles‚Äô Jacques Vidal, who coined the term ‚Äúbrain-computer interface,‚Äù used noninvasive electroencephalograms (EEGs) ‚Äî small sensors applied to the scalp ‚Äî to allow participants to control a cursor-like object on a computer screen. There followed considerable public blowback over fears of mind control, particularly as the Soviet Union conducted its own research. Only in the 1990s did the pace pick up again, including the development of the microelectrode platform called the Utah Array. In 2004, Matt Nagle became the first paralyzed person to be implanted with the Utah Array, enabling him to move a cursor, check email, operate a TV, and open and close a prosthetic hand. The Utah Array would become the gold standard for BCIs, used in many academic research labs. Musk wanted to popularize a different kind of brain implant ‚Äî one that was wireless. In 2016, Musk founded Neuralink with eight engineers and neuroscientists, including Philip Sabes, a professor emeritus at University of California, San Francisco (UCSF); Sabes had been working at UCSF on thin-film electrodes that could be robotically implanted at the micron-scale using a ‚Äúsewing machine.‚Äù Although Neuralink was registered as a ‚Äúmedical research‚Äù company, a key goal was human-AI integration, as later specified by Musk in a conversation with Wait But Why blogger and author Tim Urban. At times in the years since Neuralink‚Äôs founding, Musk was reportedly frustrated by the company‚Äôs progress. Before Neuralink could work with humans, it had to conduct extensive trials with animals. To begin with, this mostly involved rats. In his 2019 presentation, Musk revealed Neuralink had started testing primates, too. ‚ÄúA monkey has been able to control the computer with his brain. Just FYI,‚Äù he claimed. Accusations of animal cruelty led to a federal probe in 2022 for violations of the Animal Welfare Act. According to Reuters, which cited documents and interviews with 20 current and former employees, excessive pressure and rushed timelines resulted in botched experiments causing the deaths of at least 1,500 animals ‚Äî including monkeys, sheep, and pigs ‚Äî over a four-year period. Neuralink denied the animal cruelty claims at the time. (In July 2023, the federal probe found no breaches of animal welfare rules apart from a 2019 incident the company had already reported.) In 2023, Neuralink got permission from the FDA to begin testing with humans. That year, Neuralink raised around $325 million from investors who valued the company in excess of $3 billion. In 2024, Neuralink announced its first human participant: Noland Arbaugh, a thirtysomething quadriplegic, was implanted with a wireless chip smaller and supposedly more powerful than the Utah Array. Although far less invasive than procedures at labs like Caltech‚Äôs, Neuralink‚Äôs implant still involved a small part of the skull being permanently removed; the implant sits in this space with a flap of skin on top. A neurosurgeon oversaw the robot‚Äôs surgery, but the company‚Äôs ultimate goal is to fully automate the procedure. With practice, Arbaugh was able to use the BCI to control a computer cursor and play video games. But there were problems. Only a month after his surgery, around 85 percent of the threads implanted in his brain had come loose. In August 2024, it announced a second participant, implanted with a more advanced chip that enabled him to design 3D objects using computer-aided design software. In late January, Neuralink posted a clip of a robotic arm writing on a whiteboard, supposedly under the control of a third participant, and on April 27, Musk shared a video of this participant, who has ALS and is unable to speak, describing how his implant had enabled him to communicate again via a computer. More recently, the number of patients has accelerated, with Neuralink claiming it now has nine human participants. Like studies at academic labs, all of Neuralink‚Äôs participants are paralyzed. While Musk has more recently hailed the potential for Neuralink to restore a person‚Äôs ability to walk or even cure their dementia, he has more often alluded to a different objective. During an hourlong presentation in July 2024, Musk claimed that anyone with his implants would soon be able to communicate faster than a person with a fully functional body. ‚ÄúWe want to give people superpowers,‚Äù he said. SO FAR, NEURALINK HAS LARGELY built on achievements already demonstrated in the field ‚Äî cursor control, click control, and robotic arm control. ‚ÄúHow I would see it is they‚Äôre basically checking off these milestones,‚Äù the expert in touch with Neuralink staff tells Rolling Stone. ‚ÄúEverything Musk does attracts an outsized level of attention‚Ä¶. I think most scientists prefer other people to measure the significance of their work, whereas Musk is doing the opposite, and labeling everything he‚Äôs done as brand new and significant.‚Äù There are unique elements to Neuralink‚Äôs BCI, such as the robotic surgery used to implant it, as well as the wireless technology. But other companies use even less-invasive methods. Precision Neuroscience, founded by a former Neuralink co-founder, has developed a flexible electrode array thinner than a human hair, which the company describes as ‚Äúminimally invasive.‚Äù Synchron is testing a device that‚Äôs inserted into the brain through a blood vessel; the company also uses a generative chat feature powered by OpenAI to assist relevant participants with communication (it was recently reported that OpenAI co-founder Sam Altman is raising funds for a BCI startup that would compete with Neuralink). And the method of implanting electrode threads into the cortex was first developed by Philip Sabes while he worked at UCSF, before he left and co-founded Neuralink. There are also downsides to going wireless. Caltech postdoc David Bjanes notes that, while Neuralink‚Äôs device records neurons from more channels than, for example, the 384 channels provided by six Utah Arrays as in Buckwalter‚Äôs case, it currently only records from one brain area ‚Äî by contrast, Caltech‚Äôs devices record from five brain areas concurrently. With different participants having implants in different parts of the brain, the researchers have a more holistic view of how the brain performs various functions. Neuralink‚Äôs device also transmits a compressed version of its brain signal due to bandwidth limitations from being wireless, whereas Caltech can record uncompressed, high bandwidth broadband signals on all their channels. ‚ÄúAs a scientist, I am not willing to sacrifice signal if I don‚Äôt have to,‚Äù Bjanes says. ‚ÄúA wired solution that gives me as much signal as possible ‚Äî I‚Äôm going to choose that every time over another technology.‚Äù For patients, there‚Äôs a huge advantage to a wireless BCI, but that comes at the expense of gaining new knowledge about the brain that can help future patients. ‚ÄúI think the wireless technology will get there,‚Äù Bjanes says. ‚ÄúIt just is not quite mature enough.‚Äù Previously, Neuralink has been pilloried for its lack of transparency. After Musk announced on X in January 2024 that the first human had been implanted with Neuralink‚Äôs device, experts in the field and former regulatory staff expressed concerns at the piecemeal doling out of information, with specific criticism for not registering its trial at the National Institute of Health‚Äôs website ClinicalTrials.gov ‚Äî a common practice even for so-called ‚Äúearly feasibility‚Äù devices like Neuralink‚Äôs. Medical ethicists described Neuralink‚Äôs and Musk‚Äôs approach as ‚Äúscience by press release.‚Äù In May, Neuralink did register on ClinicalTrials.gov and has since shared more details of its studies. But it‚Äôs still unclear, for example, how its robotic surgery exactly works, at least to anyone outside Neuralink. And as Musk continues to make bold claims in an increasingly competitive field, experts note that, given past concerns raised by Neuralink employees, something could go wrong and set the field back years both in terms of willing participants and private investors due to the long shadow Musk casts. ‚ÄúThe ‚Äòmove fast, break things, and fix it later‚Äô philosophy of Big Tech is going to be disastrous if applied to BCIs,‚Äù says Rajesh Rao, the University of Washington professor, who argues that commercial companies like Neuralink should embed ethicists in their teams. A former Neuralink engineer tells Rolling Stone it is ‚Äúhard for anything to advance super fast for a class 3 medical device,‚Äù noting that every advance takes ‚Äúimmense effort,‚Äù testing and preclinical/clinical trials. And they claim the company moves fast ‚Äúwithout compromising safety.‚Äù Even so, concerns about Neuralink‚Äôs impact on the field only grew in the wake of Musk‚Äôs so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) instigating mass layoffs of federal staff, some directly impacting Neuralink. This sparked concern that guardrails around approval for Neuralink trials had been removed. Phyllis Fong, the USDA‚Äôs longtime inspector general who launched the ongoing probe into Neuralink for alleged animal cruelty, was forced out of her job in January. In mid-February, 20 staff members in the FDA office of neurological and physical medicine devices, including several who oversaw Neuralink, were also fired. (Shortly after layoffs in the FDA, hundreds were reportedly asked to rejoin, though it is unclear if any staff specifically reviewing Neuralink were rehired.) The cuts included reviewers overseeing clinical-trial applications by Neuralink and other companies creating BCI devices. (In April, Neuralink also falsely self-certified as a ‚Äúsmall disadvantaged business‚Äù on a federal filing, qualifying Musk‚Äôs company for funding aimed at promoting racial and ethnic diversity. As of this summer, there wasn‚Äôt evidence that they‚Äôd received the funding.) In response to criticism that Musk was removing officials responsible for regulating his companies, the White House insisted at the time that he had pledged to avoid conflicts of interest. BUCKWALTER WAS ONLY 17 when he leapt from high rocks into the Susquehanna River in Pennsylvania, breaking his neck and doing irreparable damage to his spinal cord. He spent a year in a state hospital for what were then called ‚Äúcrippled‚Äù children. While some of the other injured kids were in and out within a month, Buckwalter‚Äôs convalescence was slow. ‚ÄúI kind of had to stumble my way along,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt was the dark ages of rehabilitation medicine.‚Äù But Buckwalter did find his way, and he has gone on to live a full life by any measure. He ended up being a researcher for 15 years, writing a paper on estrogen replacement therapy for women diagnosed with Alzheimer‚Äôs disease that is still cited often, as is his groundbreaking research into so-called ‚Äúmommy brain‚Äù cognition during pregnancy, which landed him on morning news shows in the 1990s. Buckwalter conducted initial research and wrote the matching algorithm for the dating website eHarmony, founded in 2000. For a quarter century, Buckwalter has also been the frontman of a David Bowie-inspired rock band called Siggy, which still performs live. Many quadriplegics don‚Äôt make it to Buckwalter‚Äôs age. ‚ÄúFifty years post-spinal cord injury is a pretty small population of folks,‚Äù he says. In 2023, a friend and colleague who had a neuroscience Ph.D. from Caltech told him about a lab at the private university in Pasadena researching brain implants. The surgery itself involved cutting into Buckwalter‚Äôs skull to install six Utah arrays. The implants are designed to both ‚Äúread‚Äù and ‚Äúwrite‚Äù: The electrodes record neurons firing as well as stimulating activity. Buckwalter‚Äôs pioneering case also involves the world‚Äôs first chronic implant inside the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, where high-level reasoning and possible participation in language takes place. Even in the inherently more cautious academic sphere of BCIs, there are challenges for participants like Buckwalter. After falling earlier this year, he fractured his femur and damaged one of the pedestals protruding from his head, and it has taken Caltech‚Äôs neurosurgeons some time to bring the affected arrays online. He has also belatedly realized he doesn‚Äôt technically have ownership of his data ‚Äî the information gathered from his brain by the arrays during lab work with Caltech ‚Äî which complicates a proposed collaboration over the creation of a virtual clone of Buckwalter with a former student of his, Thomas Parsons, working in AI at Arizona State University. Parsons has been scraping anything Buckwalter has ever written or said on record to integrate into a large language model. This plan is to have Buckwalter‚Äôs BCI interact directly with his virtual clone, offering unprecedented insights into the holy grail of neuroscience ‚Äî the mechanics of consciousness itself. But if Buckwalter can‚Äôt access his Caltech data, the ambitious project may be imperilled. Buckwalter and other brain implantees are now trying to collectively organize behind a so-called BCI Pioneers manifesto, and are working with an attorney on a consent form addendum for all brain implant procedures. Buckwalter has proposed the catchy slogan: ‚ÄúMy brain, my data.‚Äù THERE ARE MAJOR DIFFERENCES between academic researchers and commercial companies ‚Äî and yet the fates of both are bound together. ‚ÄúThe failure and success of any one of us is all of ours,‚Äù Bjanes says. One way of warding off this danger could be by greater collaboration between companies and academic research labs. One company, Onward Medical, collaborates with Rao‚Äôs center at the University of Washington, and another called Blackrock Neurotech, which produces the Utah Array, collaborates with multiple research labs. Neuralink has made no such collaboration public. Experts speaking to Rolling Stone say Neuralink clearly has an important role to play in the field‚Äôs future, both in raising public awareness and the transformative potential of the company achieving its goal of implanting thousands of humans. ‚ÄúNeuralink‚Äôs strength is in its ability to commercialize such an intricate piece of tech,‚Äù says the ex-Neuralink engineer. ‚ÄúSure, this has existed in labs, but no one can feasibly bring it to market at scale.‚Äù Currently only a handful of participants are signed up to each academic research lab. If Neuralink‚Äôs work means there are many more participants with BCIs, and Musk releases the API to enable other researchers to access the data, it could be a game changer. Given Neuralink‚Äôs relative opacity, that seems unlikely. At the same time, Musk continues to make fantastical-sounding claims. Last year he predicted that within two decades, hundreds of millions of people would be using Neuralink‚Äôs implants. He envisions a future in which his company inaugurates superhuman cyborgs ‚Äî a techno-dystopian ‚Äúsymbiosis‚Äù with machines and artificial intelligence. AI has an important role to play with BCIs, particularly via the use of large language models (LLM) to assist the decoding of speech, learning an individual‚Äôs repeated patterns of speech and generating a voice that sounds like their own. AI has also helped patients communicate as with rival company Synchron‚Äôs OpenAI-powered generative chat feature. Musk‚Äôs leading contribution to the AI field so far has been Grok. But his X-native chatbot has repeatedly caused controversy, whether ranting about ‚Äúwhite genocide‚Äù in South Africa or praising Hitler, and replying to users with antisemitic comments. There may be reason to fear what Musk could do with experimental brain tech after seeing how Grok has turned out. Meanwhile, Musk‚Äôs big claims about brain implants‚Äô potential could end up triggering a public backlash as was seen in the 1970s. They even highlight a rift in President Trump‚Äôs coalition between the tech right and those wary of Big Tech. Former top Trump strategist Steve Bannon, a staunch critic of Musk‚Äôs transhumanist philosophy, warned in January that within 10 years, brain chips would threaten humanity as we know it, as people could face a dilemma over whether to enhance themselves or fall behind peers.

Title: Solana Enters Top 5 Cryptos With $126B Market Cap, Galaxy Digital Fuels Rally

Solana (SOL) has solidified its position among the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrencies, surpassing Binance Coin (BNB) to secure the fifth spot by market capitalization. As of September 12, 2025, SOL trades at $ 237.90, giving it a market capitalization of $126.4 billion. The rally marks a 6.8% gain in the past 24 hours and over 15% weekly growth, driven by surging institutional interest and strong on-chain activity. Analysts stress three key catalysts behind Solana‚Äôs momentum: Nasdaq‚Äôs approval of a Solana-focused listing, growing speculation over spot ETFs, and continuous network upgrades that strengthen its position as Ethereum‚Äôs closest competitor. A major driver of the rally was Galaxy Digital‚Äôs reported purchase of 2.31 million SOL tokens worth nearly $536 million within 24 hours. Blockchain data confirms transfers from Binance, Coinbase, and Bybit to Galaxy-controlled wallets, fueling speculation that the firm is aggressively backing Solana‚Äôs growth. This move follows Galaxy‚Äôs leadership in a $1.65 billion private placement for Forward Industries (NASDAQ: FORD), which is transitioning into a Solana-focused digital asset treasury. Forward‚Äôs stock soared 135% in five days, proving investor excitement. Galaxy CEO Mike Novogratz declared the start of a ‚ÄúSolana Season,‚Äù citing regulatory progress, ETF optimism, and Solana‚Äôs unmatched scalability as reasons for the aggressive accumulation. ETF speculation continues to boost Solana‚Äôs appeal. Reports suggest a 90% chance of a Solana ETF approval by late 2025, with applications from VanEck and Fidelity already in review. With staking yields around 7%, analysts believe Solana is well-positioned to attract yield-focused ETF structures. Meanwhile, Solana‚Äôs network fundamentals remain robust. August data shows 58 million monthly active users and $15.3 billion in total value locked (TVL), fueled by activity across DeFi, NFTs, and memecoins. Recent upgrades, including the Alpenglow upgrade and the upcoming Firedancer client, promise greater scalability and reduced congestion. With institutional capital flooding in, ETF approvals on the horizon, and technical upgrades boosting performance, Solana‚Äôs momentum shows no signs of slowing. Analysts now eye potential price targets between $300 and $400 in the coming months if bullish conditions persist. Cover image from ChatGPT, SOLUSD For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Should You Invest in the TIAA Real Estate Account (QREARX)?
URL: https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/qrearx-tiaa-real-estate/
Time Published: 2025-09-13T06:30:20Z
Full Content:
I get asked lots of questions about specific investments. Mostly, the question is asking me to look into my crystal ball and tell them what will provide the best return over their investment period. Aside from the fact that I'm not licensed to recommend specific investments (or paid to do so; even for our real estate sponsors, we only introduce, not recommend), the main issue here is that my crystal ball is usually about as cloudy as that of the person asking the question. However, I get this particular version of the question often enough that it seemed worth a blog post. ‚ÄúI practice in an academic setting and, like many of us at academic institutions, I have access to TIAA‚Äôs Real Estate Account. I have not been able to find any high-quality reviews of this account to help decide if it is worth investing in, and I was wondering if your team would be up for writing an article about it to provide us with your insight. Some questions that come to mind are whether it is a good investment compared to other direct real estate investing opportunities, if TIAA is considered competitive as an investing institution in the real estate world, and if the benefits of being able to invest in it in a 403(b) outweigh the tax benefits real estate investments offer investors in taxable accounts.‚Äù I have known about the TIAA Real Estate Account (fund) for decades, although I admit I don't follow it particularly closely, as it has never been accessible to me as an investment. TIAA-CREF provides a lot of 403(b)s across the country to academics, teachers, and others, and it is generally considered one of the better retirement account providers‚Äîor at least it was a decade or two ago before investing became pretty much free with the advent of sub-10 basis point index funds from providers like Vanguard, Fidelity, Blackrock, and more. The draw of the TIAA fund is that it provides DIRECT investments into real estate, rather than just buying shares of publicly traded REITs. That means there is one less layer between you and the actual investment. Presumably, that would reduce costs and reduce volatility and correlation with the overall stock market, like other direct real estate investments. Of course, one can very reasonably argue that the volatility of private real estate isn't reduced; it's just hidden due to assets not being marked to market regularly. Presumably, QREARX does have to mark to market more regularly than most direct investments, given its high liquidity. When I first learned about this fund two decades ago, I heard people speak positively about it and assumed it was pretty good, but then I forgot about it because I never had a 403(b) with access to it. Imagine my surprise when I looked it up and learned that maybe it wasn't all that awesome. Take a look at this chart from Morningstar accessed in May 2025. The top line is fund performance, and the third line is the performance of its category. See what I mean? Ten-year returns of 3% and even 15-year returns of 6% are pretty hard to get excited about. Real estate hasn't done as well as US large cap tech stocks over the last 15 years, but it hasn't been a bad asset class in which to invest. Let's compare it to my preferred publicly traded real estate investment, the Vanguard Real Estate Index fund (VNQ). This fund/ETF owns all the equity Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) traded on US markets. That 1.5% lower per year (15-year returns of 7.73% vs. 6.20%) isn't as bad as I expected, but it's still a substantial underperformance. It looks even worse over the last five years with an underperformance of 6.5% a year. It really makes you wonder what has been happening at QREARX in the last five years. Like private real estate investments, QREARX isn't marked to market as quickly as VNQ. I'm not surprised to see the delay in the poor returns, just as we saw with MANY private real estate investments that had rough years in 2023 and 2024, especially when compared to the overall stock market. QREARX VNQ If you read its documents, you can learn a lot about how an account/fund/annuity/whatever actually operates. Let me quote from it: ‚ÄúThe Real Estate Account is designed as an option for retirement and tax-deferred savings plans for employees of non-profit and governmental institutions. Investment Objective: The Real Estate Account seeks to generate favorable total returns primarily through the rental income and appreciation of a diversified portfolio of directly held, private real estate investments and real estate-related investments, while offering investors guaranteed, daily liquidity. Investment Strategy: Real Estate-Related Investments. The Account intends to have between 75% and 85% of its net assets invested directly in real estate or real estate-related investments with the goal of producing favorable long-term returns primarily through rental income and appreciation. These investments may consist of: The Account‚Äôs principal strategy is to purchase direct ownership interests in income-producing real estate, including the four primary sectors of office, industrial, retail, and multi-family, and alternative real estate sectors (defined as real estate outside of the four primary sectors noted above). In addition, the Account is authorized to hold up to 25% of its net assets in liquid real estate-related securities, including publicly traded REITs and CMBS. Management intends that the Account will not hold more than 10% of net assets in such securities on a long-term basis. As of December 31, 2024, the Account did not hold any publicly traded REITs or CMBS.‚Äù The document also notes that 15%-25% of the fund's money can be invested in liquid securities like Treasury bonds and money market funds. More information here: How to Start Investing in Real Estate The Tax-Advantaged Income from Our Passive Real Estate Investments I'm sure plenty of people love investing in QREARX. It has $22.6 billion in it. Let's consider what they probably like. The first pro of QREARX is that it provides you with a way to invest in real estate in your TIAA-CREF 403(b). You'll enjoy some tax efficiency from having your real estate investment in a retirement account. And if a huge chunk of your money is in this account, it may be the only way to have a substantial real estate investment in your portfolio. The second pro of QREARX is that it allows you to invest more directly in real estate than via a REIT mutual fund, such as VNQ. That likely results in less volatility. Of course, that works both ways. In 2021, VNQ was up 41%, but QREARX was only up 18%. On the downside, VNQ dropped 26% in 2022, and QREARX only dropped 17% across 2023-2024. All else equal, lower volatility is good. QREARX provides daily liquidity, like a typical mutual fund. That's very different from most direct real estate investments, which are generally private and offer much less liquidity. However, it does limit you to transacting once a quarter (presumably to prevent market timing) on the day of your choice. This account has only been around since 1995, but frankly, that's an eternity in the private real estate space. Few syndicators and private fund managers have been in business anywhere near that long (blog sponsor MLG is a notable exception). And TIAA itself has been around for more than a century (1918). Like investing in VNQ, you don't have to spend a lot of time worrying about being the victim of a scam here or TIAA going bankrupt. That's often not the case in the private real estate world. This investment is in your 403(b), so there is zero tax preparation required for it. That's definitely NOT the case for a portfolio of syndications or funds sending you multi-state K-1s or having to file multiple Schedule Es each year for your direct real estate investments. VNQ is just as passive as QREARX, and many private funds are similarly passive, at least after the initial due diligence. But lots of real estate takes a whole lot more work than that. Like any investment, there are pros AND cons. QREARX is no different. But the cons depend on your comparison. You have to invest in SOMETHING. Although all real estate is optional, it seemed most reasonable to compare it to the other real estate investments typically used by white coat investors rather than stocks, bonds, or some other asset class. These include public REITs via something like VNQ, passive private syndications and funds similar to those on our real estate sponsor list, and truly direct ownership of income-producing rental property (aka landlording) like we teach in our No Hype Real Estate Investment online course. Investing in VNQ, like most Vanguard index funds, is awfully close to free. The expense ratio is 0.13%. That's not the 0-5 basis points you see on a total stock market fund these days, but it's still a whole lot closer to free than most funds charge. On the other hand, QREARX charges more or less the classic ‚Äú1% a year.‚Äù In fact, it's slightly more at 1.015% a year. Those fees/expenses have to come from your returns. There is no other place to take them from. Fee comparison with private passive investments is a lot more challenging. At first glance, they seem a lot higher‚Äîoften something like 1% plus 20% of returns above 8% or so. But you have to keep in mind that some of those fees are often going to the expenses of running the investment itself. Those expenses aren't included in the ER of VNQ. It's not entirely clear how operating expenses show up with QREARX. Some private investments (like the DLP funds) don't charge you any fees until you've received your preferred return. QREARX isn't offering anything like that. I'm not sure how else to describe the last decade or two of returns for the TIAA Real Estate Account. They're obviously lower than those provided by the even more liquid and significantly cheaper VNQ. They also seem to be quite a bit lower than the returns offered by most passive private real estate investments. Let's compare a somewhat similar investment, the DLP Housing Fund. This fund isn't as liquid, although it does offer more liquidity (annual redemptions) than most private real estate investments. It is, like QREARX, evergreen‚Äîalso unlike most real estate investments. How has it been doing the last few years? Let's take a look. Unfortunately, Morningstar doesn't make a nice little graph every day for private real estate investments, but I carefully track my own returns in all of these investments. I invested $250,000 in this fund in June 2021 and have an annualized return from then until the end of April 2025 of 13% a year. By year, the returns look like this: Needless to say, 13% is way better than whatever QREARX has done over that time period‚Äîperhaps by as much as 11%-12% a year. They're both actively managed real estate funds and past performance doesn't necessarily indicate future performance, but you do have to ask yourself how much you trust the QREARX manager to do better after an underperformance like that. Even if I had just gone with VNQ, I'd be significantly ahead of QREARX. I could have taken less risk, too, and done better. Real estate debt funds have performed just fine over the last five years. We own three of them (including the DLP Lending Fund), and our returns for that asset class are a very stable 9.56% per year since we started investing in it in 2017. Now, not every private real estate turned in better performance than QREARX, but most of mine did. While it's not necessarily an indicator of future performance, low returns may be my biggest con about the TIAA Real Estate Account. QREARX may be available to you. But it's not available to me or most white coat investors‚Äîat least not without changing jobs or at least opening an IRA with TIAA-CREF. You can probably only put as much money in it as you have in your TIAA 403(b). Unlike a private equity real estate investment, you can't put it in a taxable account and enjoy passive income sheltered by depreciation. And if you use your 403(b) space for real estate, that means you can't put something else (bonds?) in there. More information here: How the IRS Treats You as a Real Estate Investor The 60+ Worst Mistakes You Can Make in Real Estate Investing While I find the concept of a liquid direct real estate investment available to non-accredited investors in their employer-provided retirement accounts very interesting, it's hard for me to get over the additional expenses and lower returns seen with QREARX. And if you're really interested in putting in some time and effort into real estate investing, you're probably not going to end up in this fund. What do you think? Do you invest in the TIAA Real Estate Account? Why or why not? What do you like/dislike about it? I was curious why QREARX has such middling returns even compared to VNQ and did a little digging. I think it might be because it is relatively conservative in its loan-to-value ratio. From the fund‚Äôs 8-K: ‚ÄúAs of March 31, 2025, the Account‚Äôs loan-to-value ratio was approximately 18.0%.‚Äù https://www.tiaa.org/public/pdf/performance/REA_FAQ.pdf For comparison, the three largest REITS in VNQ are WELL (debt to equity of 0.45), PLD (debt to equity of around 0.6) and AMT (leverage ratio of 5.1). All have much higher internal leverage. 18% LTV is extremely conservative in the real estate investing world. Your email address will not be published.

The world‚Äôs largest asset manager will announce a data centre partnership with Digital Gravity Partners, one of a string of deals to be announced during President Trump‚Äôs state visit, Sky News learns. City editor @MarkKleinmanSky Saturday 13 September 2025 06:32, UK The world‚Äôs largest money manager will use President Trump‚Äôs state visit to the UK next week to unveil a ¬£500m plan to invest in UK data centres, one of the fastest-growing areas of global infrastructure spending. Sky News has learnt that BlackRock plans to announce a joint venture with Digital Gravity Partners, a digital infrastructure investment manager, that will focus on acquiring and modernising existing data centres to improve their capacity. The project will be among dozens hailed by the government as evidence of the strength of the economic partnership between Britain and the US, as President Trump arrives in the UK against the politically tumultuous backdrop of Lord Mandelson's sacking as the US ambassador. BlackRock, which has more than $12.5 trillion in assets under management, has a significant presence in Britain, and will next week open a new Edinburgh office employing about 1,300 people. Earlier this week, Sky News revealed that Larry Fink, BlackRock's chairman and chief executive, would be part of the business delegation accompanying President Trump on the state visit. Other bosses in attendance will include Jensen Huang of Nvidia, the world's most valuable public company, and Sam Altman of ChatGPT architect OpenAI. Bloomberg News reported on Friday that the two companies would launch a multibillion-pound investment in the UK next week that will form part of the vast $500bn Stargate data centre project. Starmer urged to maximise pressure on US over tariffs ahead of Trump‚Äôs visit Charlie Kirk memorial to be held in Arizona stadium A vanity trip or a powerful card to play? What Trump's second state visit to UK really means The vast quantities being spent on artificial intelligence-related data centre infrastructure around the world represents one of the most important trends in the global economy, with the attendant strains on power resources also being throw into sharp focus. The government hopes to announce early next week aggregate figures for investment and job creation that will rival the ¬£63bn it claimed to have secured as a result of last October's International Investment Summit, according to insiders. Critically, at a difficult time for an economy which official data shows is flat lining, the string of major corporate announcements will be hailed by Sir Keir Starmer's administration as evidence that Britain remains a top global destination for foreign investment. The Office for Investment, which was recently given a beefed-up role in Whitehall, has been involved in coordinating many of the deals to be announced next week, which will encompass energy, financial services, nuclear power and technology, according to insiders. Corporate and Whitehall sources said that BlackRock's ¬£500m data centre deal would reflect the efforts of the prime minister, his business adviser Varun Chandra and chancellor Rachel Reeves to strengthen the government's relationship with the asset management behemoth during the last year. Be the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free Dozens of bosses will attend a state banquet at Windsor Castle hosted by King Charles III during next week's trip. President Trump's visit will, however, come amid tensions over his tariff regime, with continuing uncertainty about the impact on British manufacturing sectors, including steel. There are also continuing tensions between the UK government and major drugmakers over pricing, with the US administration pressuring pharmaceutical companies to slash the price of prescription medicines in the US. BlackRock declined to comment.

Title: Return of ‚Äòworld class‚Äô Aoife Wafer just what the doctor ordered ahead of France clash
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2025/09/13/return-of-world-class-aoife-wafer-just-what-the-doctor-ordered-ahead-of-france-clash/
Time Published: 2025-09-13T05:00:00Z
Full Content:
She‚Äôs only 22 and she has only played 15 Tests, but Aoife Wafer‚Äôs name stands out above all others in the Ireland team to play France in Sunday‚Äôs World Cup quarter-final (Sandy Park, Exeter, kick-off 1pm). Of course, this is largely because of her long-awaited return from knee surgery in July. But it‚Äôs not just that. When the former Irish player Jenny Murphy underlined the importance of Wafer‚Äôs return by simply describing her as ‚Äúworld class‚Äù on Second Captains this week, it wasn‚Äôt remotely wide of the mark. After all, Wafer has been named on the World Dream Team and was also the RPI‚Äôs Players‚Äô Player of the Year and Young Player of the year in 2024. That all came before her coronation as the 2025 Six Nations Player of the Championship. She earned the latter honour despite missing the last-day loss to Scotland. In four games, Wafer scored four tries, which was the joint highest for a forward. She made 70 carries ‚Äì the most of any player in the tournament ‚Äì for a staggering 424.7 metres and beat 17 defenders, the second highest of any forward. Her two tries inspired the 36-10 statement win over Australia in Belfast at the start of last season, as did her two early tries in the ensuing win over New Zealand at WXV1 in Vancouver ‚Äì powering over first from a tap penalty and then off a five-metre scrum. While this team has strong carriers in Brittany Hogan and Grace Moore, it‚Äôs doubtful any other Irish player would have scored them. Similarly, Wafer‚Äôs two tries inspired the comeback which came up just short against France in Belfast last March but which fuels belief ahead of this quarter-final, as well as another brace in the win over Wales. It‚Äôs not just the tries. Wafer can bend games to her sheer will with her carrying beyond contact, turnovers and tackling, It‚Äôs a huge ask, no doubt, for Wafer to magically rediscover her best rugby in a first outing since April, but it‚Äôs a gamble worth taking. Better to get 50 or 60 minutes out of her from the start than 20 or 30 at the end, and maybe wonder what might have been. Besides, as former Ireland international Alan Quinlan suggested during the week, the Irish management may well have opted to increase Wafer‚Äôs training load last week in preference to giving her a cameo off the bench against New Zealand last Sunday. As with this World Cup and her career, it‚Äôs clear that Wafer‚Äôs athleticism, strength and footballing ability has been fuelled by a fierce competitive nature and passion for the game, as well as her rugby roots. From Ballygarrett in Wexford, Wafer and her younger sister Orla used to watch their two older brothers play rugby in Gorey RFC. One of the boys, Sean, played for a Leinster Under-18s club side. She eventually nagged their mother Samantha into letting her play as well. Wafer also recalls passing time in the car one day with her brothers by naming as many Irish players as they could. ‚ÄúThey were there naming Johnny Sexton, Brian O‚ÄôDriscoll and all these big names in the men‚Äôs team and I named the whole women‚Äôs panel. It was a 38-player squad and I named every single one of them. They just sat there and said ‚Äòno, you can‚Äôt do it that like‚Äô.‚Äù In the days before replica women‚Äôs jerseys could be bought, the former Ireland women‚Äôs coach Philip ‚ÄòGoose‚Äô Doyle sent an autographed Irish jersey to Wafer for her tenth birthday. It has been hanging on her bedroom wall ever since and has since been joined by one of her own. At 12, she stopped playing with the boys team in Gorey and transferred to the girls‚Äô Under-15 team before moving to Enniscorthy RFC at 18. It was an important staging post where she switched from a bossy little scrumhalf to a backrower, before moving on to Blackrock and Leinster. On foot of captaining the Ireland Under-18 side, her mother received a call from the IRFU offering Wafer a full-time contract with the Ireland sevens. She relayed that news to her daughter after collecting her from school. It came with a proviso that she first complete her Leaving Cert. That was fine by her. Wafer always wanted to go into healthcare in either medicine or physiotherapy and duly studied the latter in UCD. Alas, days after her Ireland XVs debut in the 2022 Six Nations against Italy in Musgrave Park, the then 19-year-old tore her hamstring in sevens training. Between that and other things, Wafer didn‚Äôt win her second cap for another 560 days. That came as a replacement in the WXV 15-13 win against Spain in Dubai in 2023. In the 2024 Six Nations, she was twice player of the round before her 2024-25 breakout campaign. She is not shy about stating her desire to become the best player in the world and, to that end, is joining Harlequins this season. They‚Äôre in for a treat, not least as she can play the uilleann pipes, tin whistle, classical flute and the traditional flute. She brings her flute or tin whistle on rugby trips. As her Irish debut song, Wafer famously belted out Miley Cyrus‚Äôs Party In The USA on the pitch with her teammates. But after a pre-match meal of pancakes and some chill-out music, she‚Äôll listen to a track or two of traditional Irish music. She‚Äôs been missed, but she‚Äôs back and will revive her familiar matchday routine ahead of this quarter-final. It‚Äôs not stretching things to suggest that, with Wafer in the team, Ireland have a better chance of winning it.

Title: Ondo Finance Surges 20% Weekly Amid Hype and Growing DeFi Demand

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Ondo Finance (ONDO) has risen as one of the top performers in the market this week, surging 20% to trade around $1.10. The rally comes as demand for real-world asset (RWA) tokenization accelerates, pushing Ondo‚Äôs TVL to record highs. The recently launched Ondo Global Markets platform has been a major growth driver, attracting over $160 million in assets within days. The service enables investors to access tokenized versions of more than 100 stocks and ETFs, including Tesla, Nvidia, and Google. By bringing Wall Street assets onto the blockchain, Ondo is positioning itself as a leader in the $26 billion RWA tokenization market. Analysts argue that this move could transform global investing, particularly for users outside the U.S., who have traditionally faced barriers to stock market participation. Beyond its equities platform, Ondo Finance has seen explosive growth across its ecosystem. TVL on its DeFi protocols has surged from $563 million earlier this year to more than $1.57 billion today. This spike is primarily fueled by Ondo‚Äôs yield-bearing products, such as: The firm‚Äôs lending arm, Flux, has also expanded rapidly, now managing $42 million in assets compared to just $4 million last November. Like Aave‚Äôs Horizon, Flux lets users borrow stablecoins against tokenized U.S. Treasuries, creating new liquidity avenues. Ondo has also launched its own blockchain, tailored for tokenization, which strengthens its moat in a sector projected to reach trillions of dollars in value. Technically, Ondo has formed an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, a bullish reversal signal. The token recently broke past the $1.05 resistance and is now eyeing a breakout above $1.145, last seen in July. A successful move could open the door toward $1.18 and even $1.26 in the short term. However, traders are watching closely for profit-taking risks, as ONDO‚Äôs relative strength index (RSI) signals overbought conditions. Regardless, with BlackRock signaling blockchain-based ETFs and Fed rate cuts expected to fuel a broader risk rally, momentum could remain in Ondo‚Äôs favor. If sustained, Ondo Finance‚Äôs surge not only grows its role as a DeFi leader but also builds the fast-growing demand for tokenized real-world assets.

Title: Why ONDO faces bearish risk despite double-digit price gains

Time Published: 2025-09-12T21:00:30Z

ONDO swing traders should be on the lookout for a bearish trend reversal at the key supply zones just above the current market price of $1.08. The launch of Fidelity‚Äôs FDIT on-chain money market fund highlighted ONDO‚Äôs growing list of top-tier asset manager partnerships, but the price movement in the coming days might not reflect intense bullishness. Major asset managers continued to tokenize traditional financial products. Fidelity launched the Fidelity Digital Interest Token (FDIT) on the 10th of September. It is an on-chain money market fund backed by U.S. Treasuries, mostly from Ondo Finance‚Äôs [ONDO] Short-Term U.S. Treasuries Fund (OUSG) as the only anchor and largest investor. In doing so, Fidelity joined BlackRock, WisdomTree, and Franklin Templeton in offering tokenized money market or Treasury funds. Since the OUSG launch in June 2023, Ondo Finance was one of the first tokens with on-chain access to U.S. Treasuries. Over the past two days, ONDO has gained 14.1%, rallying from $0.95 to $1.08. Bitcoin [BTC] was up 3.3% and Ethereum [ETH] climbed 5.4% during the same period, helping explain ONDO‚Äôs bullish sentiment. However, technical analysis showed that the token was headed toward a supply zone, and traders and investors should be wary of a trend reversal. Source: ONDO/USDT on TradingView The 1-day market structure was bullish, and the key swing high and low were marked in orange. They were at $1.17 and $0.85, respectively, while a range formation (white) was also identified. ONDO has traded within this range since July. At the time of writing, the price was at a key supply zone from mid-August at $1.08. Another 7% move higher would take ONDO to the range highs. However, it was unclear if the current move could reach the range highs. The CMF on the daily timeframe was below -0.05, showing strong capital outflow from the market. Even though the MACD showcased bullish momentum, the seller dominance was not overthrown. Therefore, ONDO swing traders should be on the lookout for a bearish trend reversal at $1.08 and $1.17. Sustained buying pressure and high trading volume alongside a breakout past $1.17 would be a strong bullish signal in the coming weeks, but until then, the range formation would likely be respected.

Crypto exchange Gemini hit a $4.4 billion valuation on its Nasdaq debut Friday. At the time of writing, the company‚Äôs shares‚Äîwhich trade under the GEMI ticker symbol‚Äîare hovering around $34. That‚Äôs a 22.6% gain from when the stock began trading. Gemini was founded in 2014 and granted a BitLicense by the New York State Department of Financial Services the following year. The company raised $425 million through its IPO, according to Decrypt calculations based on regulatory filings. Reuters was first to report yesterday that the firm‚Äôs IPO was significantly oversubscribed. But there‚Äôs been drama brewing between the company‚Äôs founders, Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, and Commodities and Futures Trading Commission Chair nominee Brian Quintenz. The CFTC nominee shared screenshots of a July text thread with Tyler on X. The messages show that Quintenz was contacted about a complaint Gemini filed regarding alleged misconduct at the regulator. Gemini paid $5 million to settle its CFTC lawsuit in January, just a few weeks before the trial was set to begin. But in June, the company‚Äôs lawyers filed a complaint alleging the CFTC was wrong to have gone after the exchange in the first place. ‚ÄúI believe these texts make it clear what they were after from me, and what I refused to promise,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my understanding that after this exchange they contacted the President and asked that my confirmation be paused for reasons other than what is reflected in these texts.‚Äù There were a few people in the thread calling foul on his timing, especially given that his current firm, Andreessen Horowitz, has a large stake in Gemini‚Äôs direct competitor, Coinbase. Gemini is the most recent, but not the only crypto company to make its big public debut this week. Crypto lender Figure began trading on the Nasdaq under the FIGR ticker Thursday, seeing shares jump 24%. The firm stepped into public trading with an even bigger, $5.3 billion valuation. Its share price ahead of the closing bell on Friday sits around $33.46, about 33% above its $25 IPO price. ‚ÄúOur IPO showed what‚Äôs possible when blockchain meets capital markets: speed, transparency, efficiency,‚Äù the company said Friday on X. ‚ÄúIPO day was a celebration of our people, partners, and the vision driving us forward, and we‚Äôre even more excited for what‚Äôs next.‚Äù Figure CEO Michael Tannenbaum told Decrypt that the company is showing Wall Street how blockchains can be used to create more efficient markets for real-world assets, while also helping investors better grasp concepts like tokenization. Tokenization‚Äîthat is, taking real-world assets such as stocks and creating blockchain-based equivalents‚Äîhas been getting a lot of buzz lately. According to a recent report in Bloomberg, Blackrock is considering tokenizing its ETFs. No, not just BUIDL, its flagship tokenized fund launched with Securitize in 2024. The scope for this move would be much broader‚Äîand bring trillions worth of dollars with it. Even Nasdaq has expressed interest to the SEC in allowing tokenized stocks to trade on its exchanges. The company proposed that issuers would get to opt in to having tokenized versions of their securities trade. Crypto exchange Coinbase has claimed that the SEC has done ‚Äúirreparable harm‚Äù by destroying documents from its Gary Gensler era. "The Gensler SEC destroyed documents they were required to preserve and produce,‚Äù Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal wrote on X Thursday, alongside a link to the court filing. ‚ÄúWe now have proof from the SEC's own Inspector General." A report last week by the SEC‚Äôs Office of the Inspector General found that nearly a year of then-Chairman Gary Gensler's text messages were permanently deleted between October 2022 and September 2023. Coinbase has been pursuing internal SEC documents for a long time through the Freedom of Information Act and sued when the regulator denied its requests. DAT worked: Newly minted digital asset treasury GameStop notched a Q2 loss in its earnings report‚Äîbut not as bad as it might have been. The company noted its $500 million worth of Bitcoin increased in value to $528 million by the end of the quarter. Land of the rising BTC: Japanese Bitcoin treasury Metaplanet wants to raise $1.45 billion to buy more BTC. In the announcement, the company reiterated its laser-eyed thesis by pointing to ‚Äúelevated levels of national debt, prolonged real negative interest rates, and an ongoing depreciation of the yen.‚Äù Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. ¬© A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Photos by Billie Winter For nearly two years, every sunrise in Gaza has brought more death, destruction, and dislocation. To be Palestinian today is to live under unrelenting bombardment, displacement, and starvation, your community rendered a target by an Israeli regime that openly declares its intent of eradication. It is to watch American leaders respond not with outrage but with plans envisioning luxury ‚ÄúGaza Riviera‚Äù resorts and surveillance states on the same land where children‚Äôs bones are visible from hunger and their bodies are charred by US-funded bombs. This is not a natural disaster. It is a human-made horror. And yet, to be Palestinian is also to persist. To insist on life in the bowels of doom. To keep organizing, cooking, singing, teaching, and loving because to surrender your humanity is to surrender what can never be taken by force. There is no greater defiance than the will to live, to dance, to gather, even when the world seems indifferent to your existence. That is what makes this year‚Äôs second annual Palestine Will Live Forever Festival all the more urgent. It arrives not only as Gaza continues to endure mass death and forced displacement, but as Black, Brown, immigrant, trans, and poor communities across the US face escalating state violence, while reproductive freedom, environmental justice, and democracy itself hang in the balance. Yes, the day will feature an all-star lineup: Macklemore, Prometheus Brown, Fem du lit, Bambu, Jamila Woods, Noura Erakat, Nikkita Oliver, and more, but it is not just a concert. It is a gathering that reminds us that our fates are braided together, that either liberation is collective or it is not at all. Saturday will further testify that our will is not passive. It is the marrow of our survival and the pulse that refuses silence. To love one another in the face of annihilation is a political act. The festival is not merely a celebration; it is a forging. A place where joy becomes a weapon against despair, where solidarity is sharpened into strategy, and where we remember that endurance is not simply to survive, but to triumph. The Stranger spoke with four of this year‚Äôs organizers‚ÄîMaher Joudi, Gabriel Teodros, Nikkita Oliver, and Lexi Peterson-Burge‚Äîabout what it means to hold space for Palestinian liberation, to model cross-movement solidarity, and to create a festival that feeds the long struggle rather than just marking a single day. The Palestine Will Live Forever Festival takes place Saturday, September 13, from noon to 9 p.m. at Volunteer Park. Tickets are available here. This is the second year of this festival. Every day we‚Äôre seeing new horrors in the headlines and on social media. For you all, what was the onus to make sure this happened again? Why was it important to participate‚Äîwhether organizing, performing, or bringing performers? What was the impetus for doing year two? Maher Joudi: That‚Äôs a layered question, man. Personally, even leaving last year, the calls started coming in within a week‚Äîpeople asking if it would happen again. I assumed we‚Äôd try to run it back at the start of this year. Then a lot changed with the election of President Trump. We had real conversations about whether it should happen, especially from a safety perspective‚Äîthis was around when Mahmoud Khalil had just gotten taken. There was a lot to weigh. Ultimately, as a team, we decided it was necessary. Then we talked about intentionality‚Äîwhat this year should look like‚Äîbecause the horrors in Palestine had only gotten worse. And here in the US, our people‚ÄîPalestinian, Black, Latino, immigrant‚Äîwere getting taken too. The need for a day like last year‚Äôs had grown so much that it felt necessary. Gabriel Teodros: The need to gather‚Äîand to normalize resistance‚Äîbecame really clear, especially around the election. Rights were getting stripped at an exponential rate: undocumented people getting snatched, transgender people getting arrested for trying to use the bathroom. The list goes on. If we were going to do the festival‚Äîand we should‚Äîwe wanted it to be about collective liberation, to model how our struggles are connected and our pathways to liberation are bound together. That‚Äôs the direction we took. Lexi Peterson-Burge: To be transparent, we as organizers have varied identities, backgrounds, and lived experiences. That informed tough discussions about whether to move forward with a second year. We had hours of conversations about protecting communities and ourselves; about what kind of organizing meets the moment; [about] whether centering joy and a celebration of culture and resistance was appropriate and safe. We asked if it would fill the organizer cup for everyone involved‚Äîbecause our communities were experiencing different kinds of harm at the same time. We landed on this: The source of our communities‚Äô struggles‚Äîoppression, genocide, etc.‚Äîcomes from the same place. The festival could say this isn‚Äôt one community‚Äôs fight; it‚Äôs a collective fight against imperialism and capitalism and all the forces fueling the many ways our communities are being oppressed, historically and now. It gave us a chance to model cross-racial, cross-cultural, cross-movement solidarity‚Äîand to center joy as resistance while keeping our people as safe as possible. It took a month or two of serious, hard conversations. I wouldn‚Äôt have had it any other way. Nikkita Oliver: I actually stepped back from organizing for a couple months to be sure I was in alignment about why I was participating. ‚ÄúAll of us or none of us‚Äù is key for me. What‚Äôs happening to our communities is due to empire, colonialism, capitalism‚Äîrooted in anti-Blackness. Our organizing has to target those structures so we don‚Äôt end up with a world where some of us get free at the expense of others. Art and culture are resistance‚Äîdoing them out loud is resistance. But we have to go further: have present organizing bodies people can plug into. We need not just mobilized communities, but organized communities. So the festival centers intersectionality, resistance, and joy while bringing in those doing hyper-local, national, and global organizing‚Äîso when people leave, they have places to plug in. It‚Äôs more than a day; it‚Äôs a galvanizing moment that feeds the uncelebrated work between the big moments. Having organizers, vendors, and movement workers present helps make that real. There‚Äôs so much heaviness, locally, nationally, internationally. How do you balance that while planning an event that centers joy, uplifts, and mobilizes? What has that process been like? Teodros: Helping organize has been a constant reminder of what‚Äôs possible‚Äîand that we don‚Äôt get through this time alone. I‚Äôm looking at a screen full of graphics, with Zahyr [Lauren]‚Äôs beautiful art staring back at me‚Äîwhat they captured is a reminder of what it‚Äôs like when our movements come together. Working on the festival has helped me get through this year emotionally. It‚Äôs that daily reminder: it‚Äôs collective liberation or not at all. ‚ÄúAll of us or none of us‚Äù‚Äîit‚Äôs right there in the name. Peterson-Burge: This year‚Äôs been harder for me‚Äîenergy-wise, emotionally. A lot of organizers burn out, especially those with layered identities who are directly impacted by what‚Äôs unfolding. There‚Äôs a push-pull: The push is knowing you have to do something to stay whole and authentic, to show up for resistance, joy, and cultural preservation. The pull is that doing this month after month while witnessing harm drains you. Then there‚Äôs capitalism‚Äîfamilies, bills, survival. Still, I feel obligated to show up for my people. And a big reason I can is this group. We‚Äôre honest when something hits hard‚Äî‚ÄúI need a day or two‚Äù‚Äîand we show up for each other. Without this group, I don‚Äôt know that I could keep doing something at this scale right now. Oliver: Last year, the energy to do it came easier‚Äîeven though it was exhausting. Now it‚Äôs a daily barrage: executive orders, neighbors snatched by Gestapo, worsening prison conditions, targeting of gender-expansive trans and queer people, the invisibilizing of Sudan and Congo‚Äîso much to hold as an organizer and conscious person. It‚Äôs overwhelming. What‚Äôs kept me in it is that we‚Äôre having the hard conversations‚Äîcrying with each other, sometimes at each other‚Äîand practicing principled struggle. Some won‚Äôt see the value because arts and culture are central. I‚Äôd argue without arts and culture, we don‚Äôt exist‚Äîthat‚Äôs where our stories, histories, poems, relationships live. We engage culture every day‚Äîfrom clothes to music to what we read. Doing principled struggle in a space of art-as-resistance makes me want to keep going, even when it‚Äôs exhausting. Also, hearing folks‚Äô energy for it is a reminder of how important gathering is. It‚Äôs not always a 3,000-person festival‚Äîsometimes it‚Äôs dinner, a Zoom, a walk. The constant gathering matters. I‚Äôm looking forward to being in community with people who share our values and take this as a call to make our movements as intersectional as possible. Joudi: I agree‚Äîthis year is harder. I‚Äôve probably had one-on-ones with everyone here saying that. It makes me emotional to hear it out loud. Last year, I was excited‚Äîeverything was new and fast, and I didn‚Äôt have time to grasp the magnitude. This year, with more time and intentionality, I feel pressure: to show up right for our organizing team, my community, and the global community, and to represent ourselves well. I‚Äôm the oldest or second oldest on this call, but the youngest in organizing. Every day, I‚Äôm learning how to show up with intention and authenticity. I hoped Palestine would be at least a little better by now. It‚Äôs 10 times worse. And once you peel back layers, you can‚Äôt unsee them. Days are tougher‚Äîand organizing becomes a second job. But to Nikkita‚Äôs point, the energy from artists, vendors, and community‚Äîpeople asking to be involved‚Äîhas been real. Only recently did I feel the full magnitude of what this means to the community. That gives you your second, third, 10th wind when a small team is wearing a ton of hats. Knowing what this day will mean to everyone is what keeps me making calls, finishing docs, hopping on Zoom‚Äîgrounded in why we‚Äôre doing it. This is the only group I could do this with‚Äîthe one that teaches, gives grace and support, and helps us grow together. We‚Äôre seeing mobilizations globally and nationally‚Äîmarches, strikes, flotillas, and more. How do you see this festival in conversation with those acts of solidarity? Oliver: Shout out to Gabriel and Maher for the lineup ideas‚Äîthat‚Äôs where intentional solidarity shows up. Who we invited and why had everything to do with the messaging artists already live in their art and movement work. The lineup alone speaks to how we aim to operate in solidarity. Palestine is at the center of why we came together, but we‚Äôre also clear that we‚Äôre resisting larger structures. We want folks to leave with a deeper analysis of what we‚Äôre fighting and how. As an artist and cultural worker, I think about music, poetry, visual art‚Äîeven the food we choose‚Äîas ways to bring us back to each other. Actions like the flotilla aim to break a siege, meet basic needs, and galvanize organized response to empire‚Äôs violence. The festival does parallel work: supporting HEAL [Palestine]‚Äôs care for children who‚Äôve lost limbs; the Transgender Law Center‚Äôs protection of our trans siblings; La Resistencia‚Äôs frontline organizing at the Northwest Detention Center. These are tangible, often hyper-local ways to show up. Choosing beneficiaries like Water Protectors, the Black Panther Party, and BLM Washington reflects that our struggles are interconnected. Palestinians benefit from La Resistencia‚Äôs work; Black queer folks benefit from the Transgender Law Center and the Panthers. We‚Äôre showing up in multifaceted ways‚Äîcare, organizing, resistance‚Äîand that starts on stage. No matter who you hear, you‚Äôll get that message. Deepening our analysis deepens our resistance and commitment. I hope people leave with their cup filled and a fire to act. Peterson-Burge: I remind myself: Showing up in the streets is as important as showing up for cultural preservation, togetherness, breaking bread, teaching dances, eating the foods we‚Äôve missed. All of it matters so we don‚Äôt lose ourselves while we fight for everyone. Creating space to preserve ourselves and our cultures is powerful, transformative, revolutionary‚Äîand necessary. Joudi: At the core, these movements are the same: people from all walks of life standing against oppression. Forty-plus countries supporting a flotilla is all of us understanding we must stand for all of us. That‚Äôs what we embody‚Äîthrough many avenues. Cultural preservation is huge. Speaking as a Palestinian, erasure includes stealing our culture‚Äîclaiming hummus, rewriting our history. Supporting Palestinians isn‚Äôt only about Gaza and the West Bank‚Äîthere‚Äôs immediate need, yes, but Palestine lives forever by preserving our culture. That‚Äôs true for every community represented here. Preserving who we are is how we win. For folks new to this movement or who didn‚Äôt attend last year, what do you want them to take away after attending? Joudi: For my community: the need for collectiveness. I‚Äôve shouted for Palestine my whole life, and I ‚Äúgot‚Äù interconnectedness‚ÄîFerguson in 2016‚Äîbut I hadn‚Äôt truly connected the dots on intersectionality and riding for each other. Our heroes have been telling us: Leila Khaled said 50 years ago there is only one oppression. The Panthers visited Philistine and stood with Palestine. Kids in Gaza held ‚ÄúI stand with Ferguson‚Äù signs. Our movements fall apart when we‚Äôre convinced to battle each other for attention. I want folks to understand it all needs to be discussed and fought for at the same time‚Äîit‚Äôs the same fucking move. The music, speakers, vendors are dope‚Äîwe‚Äôll feel good‚Äîbut I need everyone to leave knowing we‚Äôre all connected against them. If you‚Äôre with them, you‚Äôre not with us. If you‚Äôre with us, you‚Äôre with all of us. Teodros: As a musician, I want artists to walk away less afraid and less alone in speaking up for Palestine. Somehow calling a genocide a genocide is still controversial. We intentionally booked people already making bold stands for humanity. I want that‚Äîand collective liberation‚Äîto become the norm. Culture helps by modeling it and building our own stages when others won‚Äôt book this‚Äîwe have to do it ourselves. Also, let‚Äôs name it: Live Nation‚Äôs second-largest shareholder is BlackRock; Ticketmaster is part of that ecosystem‚Äîthere are corporate interests in silencing artists. We can‚Äôt let them dictate culture. We do that‚Äîcommunity, people, artists. Oliver: It would be easy to assume we had every resource from day one. We didn‚Äôt. We showed up finding resources as we went. You can have a big vision and then call your homies and make it happen‚Äîthat‚Äôs how this happened. If we want more control, we have to build it. Our communities have long built institutions outside government‚Äîmutual aid networks, survival structures‚Äîout of brilliance and necessity. I hope folks leave thinking: We have the capacity to build our own structures for self-governance. Many hands make light work. And I hope the Black community sees our trans siblings as central to Black struggle; that we see immigrants‚Äô fights against ICE and Indigenous fights for resources as ours too. There is no single-issue struggle. We can build what we need, together. Peterson-Burge: I want everyone to leave feeling, ‚ÄúI really needed that‚Äîand I got it.‚Äù To have been in space with our people and felt joy. And then I want folks to plug into an organizing home‚Äîconsistently. If you don‚Äôt have one, find one: a book list, political education classes, places to learn our intertwined histories. I want cross-pollination‚ÄîPalestinian homies connecting with the Black Panther Party; Black queer siblings pulling up with La Resistencia. Also, as a fundraising person, sustaining our movements means mobilizing the masses to support them. The festival is a vessel to move resources to under-resourced movements so our people can keep doing the work. If we can give a small grassroots org two more months of budget to keep stopping detentions, that matters. If five more people give $10 so they can buy water for volunteers, that matters. Our beneficiaries span different movement spheres to reach widely, rooted in intersectionality and collective struggle. I hope folks take action. Is there a moment from the past year of putting this together that represents the hope of what this festival means? Teodros: From an artist‚Äôs perspective: seeing artists meet through the festival and then collaborate. Even before the first one, watching Desir√©e Dawson‚Äîa Black woman in Canada‚Äîcovering Samer, a young Palestinian artist‚Äôs, song, and sharing it online. Seeing Bambu and the Neighborhood Kids meet at the festival and then collaborate on music and a series of events. Maher was involved in events around the country with lineups that mirrored ours. Bringing folks together and watching them keep working‚Äîthat‚Äôs meaningful. A post shared by Bambu DePistola (@bambudepistola) Joudi: Those moments were heartwarming. Where it really clicked for me‚Äîthis isn‚Äôt just an event, it‚Äôs moving a movement forward‚Äîwas in the last week or so. Vendors reaching out: ‚ÄúI missed the deadline, but I need to be there.‚Äù Artists asking to get on the lineup. Those are hard conversations‚Äîwe want to keep it fresh and platform new voices‚Äîbut the community‚Äôs feedback at every level has been powerful. Even on logistics calls‚Äîlike with the video wall folks‚Äîpeople who weren‚Äôt involved last year were hyped because of the cause. Last year, stage staff told us how grateful they were to work the festival‚Äîwe‚Äôre feeling that again. Stepping outside myself, I feel grateful and blessed to help make this happen, no matter how hard the work is, knowing what it means to people and what it will do for the community. Oliver: Two moments. First: Last year, a homie brought his elementary-aged son. I was stage-managing and saw them dancing together during Native Guns‚Äô set. Afterward, he told me it was a transformative moment‚Äîpassing down the cultural work of artists who politicized him, and watching his son be politicized by the same art, in joy. That‚Äôs joy as resistance‚Äîcreating space to pass down resistance through art. Second: During Whodinii‚Äôs set, the Palestinian community‚Äîand comrades‚Äîbroke into a big circle dance. Organizers and volunteers literally lost themselves in that moment, because they knew we built a space where we care for each other. You didn‚Äôt need your head on a swivel like at a protest. It was unbridled, embodied resistance. That‚Äôs what the festival is about‚Äîand the world I hope we get. Peterson-Burge: I was going to name that dance moment too‚Äîseeing Palestinians and other Arab folks teaching others how to do it was beautiful. Two other (selfish) moments for me: walking into the grounds that morning and seeing the banner and stage set with last year‚Äôs image‚Äîrealizing, ‚ÄúWe did that.‚Äù I had to walk off and cry. It represented weeks of late nights, fundraising, calls, crying, arguing‚Äîthe whole thing‚Äîbecoming real. Then at the end, bringing all the organizers onstage, arms around each other, taking a deep breath: ‚ÄúDang, we did that.‚Äù Most of us didn‚Äôt know each other closely before last year‚Äîwe put that first festival together in six to eight weeks. Now these people are my family. They‚Äôre coming to my wedding. That kind of relational, transformational organizing‚Äîwhere I can have hard conversations and be heard‚Äîwas what I needed. It‚Äôs a huge reason I‚Äôm doing this again. If my people are doing something, I‚Äôm showing up‚Äîtired or not‚Äîbecause I know they‚Äôll show up for me.

(Bloomberg) -- BlackRock Inc. executive Rick Rieder is rising up the list of contenders to serve as the next chair of the Federal Reserve after Jerome Powell‚Äôs term expires in May, according to an administration official. In a wide-ranging interview that lasted for two hours on Friday in New York, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Rieder discussed monetary policy, the Fed‚Äôs organizational structure and regulatory policy, the person said, who requested anonymity to discuss a private meeting. Bessent has so far interviewed four of the 11 candidates publicly named as under consideration for the top central bank job, the official said, emphasizing that the process is ongoing. One or two more names will likely be added to that list, according to the person. Rieder is one of the most senior executives at BlackRock, overseeing the firm‚Äôs fixed income business. He joined the company in 2009, following nearly two decades at Lehman Brothers Inc. A representative for BlackRock had no immediate comment. Bessent was impressed with Rieder‚Äôs long career in markets running large groups and his deep understanding of micro- and macro-contributors to the economy, according to someone familiar with the Treasury secretary‚Äôs thinking. Rieder would bring a calm demeanor and in-depth knowledge of financial firms outside the banking system if he becomes Fed chair, the person said. Bessent appreciates Rieder‚Äôs ability to use forward-looking frameworks to assess the economy, rather than relying on backward-looking data, the person said. The Treasury chief was impressed by a similar intuitiveness after a conversation with Fed Governor Christopher Waller over the summer. President Donald Trump has been frustrated with Powell‚Äôs dependence on data to guide the Fed‚Äôs next moves, giving him the nickname ‚ÄúToo Late.‚Äù Two senior staffers, one who is a macro-economist and another with regulatory and markets expertise, were in the room for Bessent‚Äôs meeting with Rieder. Trump last week said that his top candidates for Fed chair include Waller, former Fed official Kevin Warsh and Kevin Hassett, the director of the White House‚Äôs National Economic Council. However, he has deputized Bessent to run a comprehensive search process. The Treasury chief has said that he will interview all the contenders and offer Trump a shortlist of three to four to consider later this fall. --With assistance from Silla Brush.

Title: BlackRock Weighs Tokenized ETFs Following Bitcoin Fund Surge

BlackRock is moving deeper into tokenized funds, and the moves are starting to look like a bid to bring traditional ETFs onto blockchains. Reports have disclosed that the firm‚Äôs tokenized money market product, known as the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund or BUIDL, is already live on the Ethereum network and works with firms such as Securitize and BNY Mellon for transfer agent and custody roles. According to filings and industry reports, the BUIDL fund is backed by cash, US Treasury bills, and repurchase agreements. Transfer agent duties are being handled by Securitize while custody services are provided by BNY Mellon. Other infrastructure providers named in reports include Fireblocks, BitGo, Coinbase and Anchorage Digital. The fund pays yields to token holders on a daily basis using blockchain rails, and it is being positioned as a bridge between classic cash-like instruments and programmable token holdings. JUST IN: BlackRock plans to tokenize ETFs following success with $BTC fund. pic.twitter.com/yQD0E4VjpX ‚Äî Whale Insider (@WhaleInsider) September 11, 2025 Executives have been quoted as saying tokenization could scale far beyond a single fund. Reports have put a potential addressable market figure as high as $10 trillion if a broad array of assets and ETFs are moved on-chain over time. Industry trackers also show that the total value locked in tokenized real-world assets passed $10 billion in recent months, a sign that the market is no longer purely experimental. BlackRock‚Äôs activity has prompted comparisons with other large asset managers, such as Franklin Templeton, which have also launched tokenized offerings. Proponents say tokenized ETFs could allow fractional ownership and round-the-clock transferability, and they could speed settlement in some cases. Reports say tokenization may also boost transparency since ownership records can be viewed directly on the chain. At the same time, uncertainty remains over how tokenized ETF shares will interact with existing market structures such as APs and market makers, and whether on-chain trading will be treated the same as exchange trading under US securities rules. Regulators, custodians and auditors face hard choices about legal rights, disclosure and investor protections for tokenized securities. On the basis of sector coverage, firms continue to sort out custody architectures and legal wrappers that provide enforceable claims on the underlying assets to token holders. Various jurisdictions might draw different conclusions, which would impede cross-border adoption or confine rollouts to individual markets. BlackRock‚Äôs investigation into tokenized ETFs is a follow-up on the success of its Bitcoin fund, already attracting robust inflows and market interest. The firm‚Äôs success in that department is now generating speculation that its next move will be to take pieces of its multi-trillion-dollar ETF business on-chain. Should the transition occur, it would represent one of the biggest steps so far by a global asset manager towards investment products based on blockchain.

Title: When You May Want To Add Guaranteed Income To Your Financial Picture
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/cicelyjones/2025/09/12/when-you-may-want-to-add-guaranteed-income-to-your-financial-picture/

ByCicely Jones , Contributor. Due to many investors‚Äô uncertainty about today‚Äôs market, I‚Äôve seen many people opt to move entirely to cash and take investing off the table, but I‚Äôve also had many investors approach me with questions about how to protect their investments and guarantee income. At the end of the day, the right investment for you entirely depends on your financial goals, time horizon, risk tolerance, and alternative options you are considering. Here is information on how guaranteed income may fit into your financial picture. When investors are fearful, I often see them do one of a few things: If your asset allocation is well-diversified and consistent with your risk tolerance and you can remain disciplined, most of the best advice indicates that if you can stand it, to go with the first option. Moving toward cash and cash alternatives in the moment can feel satisfying in the moment but will ultimately diminish your purchasing power and reduce your lifetime income potential. Making speculative bets can easily result in losing your entire portfolio. I recently asked an investor how he landed on his investment portfolio because it did not appear to be following a cohesive strategy, and it was losing badly to every benchmark. He responded, ‚ÄúYoutubers and vibes.‚Äù While that has some entertainment value, I don‚Äôt recommend that sort of strategy for anyone who wants to reach a financial goal like retirement. There are several types of annuities and structured products, but I‚Äôd like to focus on indexed annuities and variable annuities because they can solve for longevity risk, inflation risk, volatility risk, interest rate risk, and taxation risk for the right investor. A variable annuity is a long-term financial product designed for retirement purposes. In essence, an annuity is a contractual agreement in which payment(s) are made to an insurance company, which agree to pay out an income or a lump sum amount at a later date. Typically, variable annuities have mortality and expense charges, account fees, investment management fees and administration fees. In addition, annuity policies have exclusions and limitations, early withdrawals may be subject to surrender charges and, if taken prior to age 59 1/2, a 10% federal income tax penalty. Variable annuities are subject to investment risks, including possible loss of principal. An indexed annuity is a type of insurance contract that pays an interest rate based on the performance of a market index. It differs from a fixed annuity, which pays a fixed rate of interest, and a variable annuity, which bases its interest rate on a portfolio of investment options chosen by the annuity owner. Indexed annuities are sometimes referred to as equity-indexed or fixed-indexed annuities. One of the biggest questions when determining your retirement income need is how long you might live. According to Flowing Data, using information from the Social Security Administration, a female 40-year-old has: Essentially, the odds are highly in your favor of making it past age 80. This can present a problem when you try to make your money stretch potentially over 40 years. Because annuities are designed to pay out for someone‚Äôs entire life, regardless of what happens in the market, this can be particularly attractive to those with a family history of longevity. According to a 2024 BlackRock study, 97% of annuity owners say their annuities cause them decreased stress about running out of money. Over the last 100 years, inflation has averaged about 3% per year. That means that every year, to live the same lifestyle, your cost will go up. Let‚Äôs say your fixed expenses are $2,000 per month today. In 10 years, assuming 3% inflation, that monthly expense would be almost $2,700 per month. If you are considering sitting in cash, you will be losing purchasing power each year. While some annuities just pay a fixed amount every year, others can grow your payment amount each year through some combination of market returns or a guaranteed roll-up. When you are still in your accumulation phase without a thought of near-term withdrawals, you may be able to easily handle portfolio volatility. However, when you end up needing distributions, volatility can be a serious problem. Let‚Äôs go through two examples: Investor A has a portfolio value of $1,000,000 and an income need of $50,000 per year: Investor B has a portfolio value of $1,000,000 and an income need of $50,000 per year: Even though they started with the exact same amount, needed the exact same income, and had the exact same average return in two years, Investor B is in a significantly worse position because they started with a negative year instead of a positive one. If you take extend these small differences out 40 years, Investor B is more likely to run out of money than Investor A if they start in a worse market but ultimately achieve the same average return. Guaranteed income products attempt to eliminate that risk of timing issues leading to depletion of retirement savings. In retirement, I often see investors turning to money market funds, CDs, and fixed income investments. All of these are subject to interest rate risk. In the not-too-distant past, investors were getting between 0-2% on these types of investments, not even keeping up with inflation. Annuities are designed to provide some stability and predictability with guaranteed rates, making retirees less susceptible to interest rate risk. In nonretirement accounts, guaranteed income products offer tax-deferral during the accumulation phase. This means that unlike in brokerage accounts where you pay taxes every year on interest, dividends, and rebalancing, you will only pay taxes on the growth when you distribute funds. There is a good reason that annuities of the past have had negative associations. Not all guaranteed income products are created equal and it‚Äôs essential to speak with a qualified financial professional, about your goals and if a guaranteed income product is the right fit for a piece of your financial picture. In today's uncertain market, adding guaranteed income product offerings like annuities can address risks such as longevity, inflation, volatility, interest rates, and taxes. However, it's crucial to consult with a financial professional to ensure these products align with your unique goals and circumstances, enhancing your financial security and future planning.

Title: Nineteen Years of Shifting Goals

It is time for 19! Number 19 ‚Äì Corvette No, not that 19. The blog turns 19 today. Ever WP.com admits I have been around that long. The annual WP.com greeting And 19 years is kind of a long time, with nearly a third of my life involving me tapping out typo filled first drafts and pressing the publish button more than 7,500 times. But we‚Äôll get to the silly stats a bit further down the page. And yet it feels a bit like a lesser turning of the years, just one shy of 20, a nice big round number that is so much more impressive than 19. 19 feels like it is almost there, while 20 has arrived. Or so it goes with those of us who count in base 10 I suppose. As part of Blaugust I reflected a bit on the writing process, as I am wont to do, but also considered the goals of the blog, what my writing assignment here is, was, and might end up being. I say that because I certainly didn‚Äôt start out the way things are now. It took a while to establish whatever we call what I am doing now. If we go back to that very first post back in September of 2006, I seemed to want to write about games I had already played, to go over my history. And I certainly did some of that. I wrote about early online games like Stellar Emperor and Air Warrior and TorilMUD. I tried to tease out memories of things like Starsiege: Tribes and the early days of EverQuest. You can find more than a few posts about games I played before I started blogging. But things quickly turned to talking about MMOs and what might come next. We were in both the age of blogging and of MMORPG popularity. We were going to have all sorts of MMOs, and they were going to be about anything and everything. Even Micheal Jackson. Planet Michael‚Ä¶ only to be imaged, never to be seen And then the WoW killer‚Ä¶ because surely somebody would come along and dethrone the mighty king of MMORPGs‚Ä¶ never appeared. It captured and dominated the market and its peak was never eclipsed in the west and developers game up on that and started trying to cash in on the next trend, which was Facebook games or free to play MMOs or MOBAs or Kickstarted nostalgia farming name driven projects‚Ä¶ all of which I covered some here and there. Almost all of them failed to live up to their promise and most failed to survive for very long. As part of that I started posting about events and launches and expansions and updates, if only just to establish a timeline so that I could remember what changed when. Along the way I wrote about what I was playing. At first those posts were haphazard, lacking in detail and mostly just ‚ÄúI did a thing‚Äù without much around it. That developed as a style, focused around the instance group and our adventures in Azeroth, but also around EVE Online and the ongoing struggle to find the game in the sandbox. That expanded to other games we played and got more detailed. Likewise, once I found my niche in null sec, posts about the ups and downs of space empires in New Eden began to figure much more. For no real reason beyond ‚Äúit seemed like a good idea at the time‚Äù I wrote a Month in Review post at the end of that first September and have continued to do so every since. While those posts feature quite a bit of fluff, the revisiting of what I wrote about a year ago, five years ago, ten years ago, and so on‚Ä¶ that became a cornerstone of my own experience with the blog, reminding me of the past and where I have been and what I have done online. In the end, it turned out the blog turned out to be about games I had played, my gaming history and such. I was just writing it as it went and it slowly became nearly two decades of history, and not all of it a complete waste. There is a whole page or so in Empires of EVE: Vol II that reprints my observations on the battle at 6VDT-H. My account, written the next day while the events of the battle were still fresh in my mind ended up being, ended up being able to provide some flavor of the battle in a book about the conflict of empires in which I was just one guy in a ship. And I still get a nod now and then for having written up something that didn‚Äôt make the news or other outlets. Recently I even got a nice message from Asher Elias, head of the Imperium, who is working on his own history of the game and null sec who said: your site has been so helpful it‚Äôs hard to overstate the value I feel pretty good about that. The blog, in the end, became something of what I intended, if not in exactly how I envisioned getting there. Though, again, that might apply more to EVE Online that other titles due to the nature of the game. The player driven nature of New Eden means that major events, battles and such, are one time unique events. Meanwhile, in WoW for example, every Deadmines run faces the exact same set of challenges, so the tale of our group is hardly unique save for the fact that we were there for that particular moment. What do I take from that? Don‚Äôt hesitate to write down some event? Maybe. Different from where I started for sure. And even these anniversary posts have evolved over time. As I always say, look at all the work I put into some of those early posts. They had themes! Now‚Ä¶ well, go back and look at some of the old ones if you want fancy. Here they are: That is the preliminaries. Actually, I even gave you most of the reflections up front this time. Not sure what I‚Äôll have at the back end. We shall see. The Basic Stats Days since launch: 6,940 (+376, because I had to calculate early last year) Posts total: 7,572 (+400) Total Words: 6,783,396 Average words per post: 895 (+58) Post Likes: 25,294 Average posts per day: 1.091 (-0.001‚Ä¶ I am slowing‚Ä¶ so very slowly) Comments: 40068 (+1,089) Average comments per post: 5.29 (-0.12) Average comments per day: 5.77 (-0.25) Comments written by me: 8,264 or 20.6% Space used by images: 4.7 GB used, 9.1 GB (70.2%) upload space remaining. Blog Subscribers: 3,523 (+975, mostly spammers) US Presidents since launch: 4 British Monarchs since launch: 2 Prime Ministers of Italy since launch: 9 Summary: I write a lot of words still and we have a retread president. Also, last year in my rush to get on a plane for our 25th wedding anniversary trip I totally didn‚Äôt update some of those numbers and I am too lazy to go re-figure the increment. But nobody commented on my, for example, saying I had surpassed the word count for the Wheel of Time series of books when the number I was showing was clearly less than that. But I am well past that now. Data Unfiltered So what is going on here at the blog? People still come to visit. Not as many as used to, but many more than I figured ever would. So let‚Äôs see what the numbers are, starting with page views. Year 19 ‚Äì Page views by month If you add up the numbers along the right hand side it comes out to something like 6,863,443 page views over the life of the blog. That is more than I ever expected, though probably less than somebody like Amazon gets over the course of a minute on any given day. You can see the peaks and valleys of the site over the years. The high point was 2012, as I have oft indicated. Things really fell off after Covid, with 2021 and 2022 seeing the lowest numbers since the first year of the blog. Then things have revived a bit. Summed up by full year‚Ä¶ so leaving out 2006 and 2025 so far‚Ä¶ the trend looks like this. TAGN Page View Traffic by Full Years ‚Äì 2007 through 2024 2007 remains the full year with the lowest count, but 2022 wasn‚Äôt that far behind. And then there is one more chart I usual toss in here. I usually just paste in an image of it, but I prefer actual numbers rather than pictures of numbers, so I am once again going to let WP format some data from Excel. So that is either a nicely formatted chart with numbers or a bunch of mushed up garbage, likely the latter if you‚Äôre reading this on your phone. Sorry about that. As you can see, until this year the number of words per post had been mostly rising. I don‚Äôt know what got into me in 2024, where I got close to 1,500 words per post, but this year I am down somewhat. Part of the rise in words has to be my month in review posts, which get a chunk longer every five years. But most of it is likely me taking care to fill in more details about things in posts as you never know what is going to end up being a critical or interesting tidbit of information years down the road. Who Sends People Here? Search engines. Seriously, that is most of the traffic. And Google is 98% of the search engine traffic. He is how search engines shake out. Google is on there three times‚Ä¶ though Google Image Search isn‚Äôt the mighty referral engine it once was‚Ä¶ because Google decided to just download all your images‚Ä¶ excuse me, it cached them. On the bright side, Bing recognizes me again. It had de-indexed me for a stretch. On the flip side of that, does it matter? Also, hello my two AOL users, because I doubt the same AOL user landed here twice. Then there is social media and social media like sites‚Ä¶ who no longer send me that much traffic anymore. At one time social media was a lot better at sending traffic out. But now sites like X go out of their way to keep people from leaving. Not that I post anything to X in any case, I deleted my account there more than a year back. New on the list, the AI sites are coming for us! Not really a force to be reckoned with at this point, but some of those sites only recently started trying to show their work. Then there are my fellow bloggers. They do send me a bit of traffic, more than some social media sites I post to daily. Here are the top ten blogs that send me traffic. Eight of those ten are Blogger based blogs that use the dynamic blogroll sidebar widget. Two of those eight aren‚Äôt even updated regularly, but still send me traffic due to that blogroll option. The Greybill is a fellow WP.com blog and just linked to me about a couple of EVE Online things, which I appreciate. And then there is I Has PC‚Ä¶ or there isn‚Äôt I Has PC, as the site no longer responds. But is sent me a bit of traffic right up until the very end. More Frivolous Data We‚Äôll start once again with the top ten categories of posts here, and the change since last year. Out of 104 total categories, a number unchanged since last year, these are, were, and remain, the most used. Null Sec, which is a sub-category, made it on to the list this year. Meanwhile, Sony Online Entertainment, a category that hasn‚Äôt been valid or used for the last decade, that finally fell off the top ten. Then there are tags, which represent the land of chaos. Tags I slap on a post at a whim, as a joke, as a futile attempt to signal tone or intention. And sometimes I use tags for games I am not sure quite deserve a category yet. No Man‚Äôs Sky is only a tag so far. So there are 5,065 tags used on the blog, up 287 from last year. For tags I feel like I have to do a top 20 just to get some scope. As always, the category often drives the tags used. If I write more EVE Online posts than anything else, then there are more EVE Online related tags. And, as I have done in the past, here are the tags I have used exactly 19 times over the last 19 years. It turns out there are ten of them. I actually know what all of those are related to. Last year I had a couple of ‚Äúuh?‚Äù items on the list. What Do People Read Here? Here are the Top 20 most viewed posts over the last 12 months here on the site: That tells you what is popular, or at least what Google sends me. I seem to be answering some Pokemon Go questions for people, with five posts on the list. I am also interested to see how much No Man‚Äôs Sky traction I have gotten. As a game I haven‚Äôt elevated it to its own category yet because I have only written 16 posts with the associated tag, and a couple of those are month in review summaries. Maybe I should fix that. I gave Elite Dangerous a category slot and only used it four times. Certainly NMS has gotten more play time out of me. Also, I seem to have hit a nerve with my iTunes post. That was‚Ä¶ last week, and it made the top 20 for the last 12 months? Then there is the ALL TIME TOP 20 posts list. First of all, I doubt I will ever have another post pass the 50K page view mark. The three that are up there are cemented by having been popular during the peak era of the blog. The average number of page views for the top 500 posts, which is all WP.com will let me see, is 1,457. The average for all 7,572 posts is probably double digits, even with Alamo and the Play On Guild Name Generator sitting above 60K. There are a lot of posts with 5 page views. There are also some classics in there. The EVE Online tutorial post, which was the fourth post on the site, and the first one addressing a game I was actively playing‚Ä¶ well, it was a different time. No screen shots, just ire. I have suggested that it was my desire to rant about that tutorial that finally drove me to start a blog. Otherwise, that is a load of stuff that Google liked at one point or another. The Inevitable Summing Up Sometimes I arrive at this point in these annual posts and wonder aloud if I should take a break, not write so much, or change up what I write about. But if you‚Äôve read down this far you‚Äôre not falling for that. I can‚Äôt even fool myself on that front anymore. Hell, last year I said I might not bother to do an annual review post, but here I am, Mister Unreliable Narrator. No matter how tired I am at the end of the day, I somehow always have something I want to post about. And it is even about video games most days! My goal, which I ended up setting a year or two in when I decided to reign in chaos and maybe have a plan, was to have a post on every week day, leaving aside weekends for overflow or non-gaming topics of whatever. I have somehow exceeded that plan‚Ä¶ to the point that I have posted every day for the last 1,993 days in a row, or every day since March 29, 2020. Maybe I could give up on that streak‚Ä¶ though, again, just seven more days for a round number. Really, though, I am wondering what I should do for the 20th next year. Open to ideas. Just 12 months to work that out. I started reading during the Casino War. The blog epitomized that Eve is a game I love reading about but never want to play. I stayed for the WoW and ‚Äúhistory of Silicon Valley‚Äù content. Now you‚Äôre now a daily read for me. Congrats on 19 years! LikeLike Congratulations for the milestone. When it comes to the referral stats I‚Äôve always wondered what it counts old school accessing via a favourite/ manually typing in the address ‚Äì which is what I still mostly doing But yes, I can quite see your blog now being a resource for EVE history (and MMOs in general) quite similar to reviewing old newspapers. A contemporaneous record which reminds me, in a strange way, of some of the mediaeval annals I used to study at university. Which also used to have digressions onto this and that, just like your blog does. Anyways, hope you have a good twentieth year, and that these virtual worlds allow you to escape at least now and then from the ‚Äúreal‚Äù world, whatever the hell that is anymore. LikeLike Grats on another year. I do rememner when you were wondering out loud how much longer you‚Äôd go on. Glad to hear that‚Äôs stopped! Shame to hear I Has PC has folded. I thought I‚Äôd seen a couple of comments by Isey here and there, this year. I tried to look something up on Herding Cats the other day and Liore‚Äôs gone too. Confusingly, there is an unrelated blog called I Like Herding Cats‚Ä¶ Still, I keep them all in that so-useful Blogger blogroll because if any of the dead ones ever sputter back into life, they pop up right back at the top and everyne knows about it. It‚Äôs like a public service now‚Ä¶ LikeLike Well done. If in Australia your blog would be starting its second year of legally being able to drink alcohol. While I might go research something you have said ‚Äì I don‚Äôt recall ever fact checking you, so I missed the wheel of time test. LikeLike Congrats! Has your blog signed up for Selective Service yet? LikeLike I had to look that up‚Ä¶ and I guess it is still a thing. I did that 42 years ago. LikeLiked by 1 person My son had to do that when he turned 18, but my daughters are still exempt. I‚Äôm counting down the days until he turns 26 so he‚Äôs no longer eligible, but that also means he‚Äôll no longer be on my insurance. LikeLike Proud to link to you from both my blogs! And I just wanted to say I also find your ‚Äúposting to mark various events/milestones‚Äù useful, even as someone who doesn‚Äôt play EVE. There has been more than one occasion when I‚Äôd wonder about something like ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt I read about Everquest doing something like that once‚Äù and your blog is often a great place to verify random MMO trivia like that. I‚Äôve also found your whole attitude towards blogging inspiring and am definitely emulating it a bit in the sense that I also post about many things with an eye to wanting to be able to have a reference point in the future. Documenting things is fun! Anyway, grats on 19. LikeLike Congrats! LikeLike Œî Email Address: Email Posts to Me!

Title: Asset Managers Point to Dangers of ‚ÄòOver-Customization‚Äô of Portfolios

‚ÄúPersonalization gone too far I think erodes the value of really great active management with really great risk management wrapped around it,‚Äù said one asset manager. September 12, 2025 Over the last five years, direct indexing has been talked about as the next frontier in investment management, and demand for these strategies continues to rise. As of the end of 2024, there were $864.3 billion in direct indexing strategies, according to Cerulli Associates. Several asset managers, speaking at the Future Proof Festival in Huntington Beach, Calif., this week, confirmed the demand for personalized and customized investment strategies. But they also warned against ‚Äúover-customization.‚Äù ‚ÄúPersonalization can mean vastly different things when it comes to investing,‚Äù said Andrea Lisher, head of Americas, Client, J.P. Morgan Asset Management. ‚ÄúIf you look at long-term track records, it‚Äôs very, very difficult to beat the markets, and if every individual could do that‚Äîdo their own thing‚Äîyou wouldn‚Äôt need firms like ours who spend hundreds of millions of dollars on research and traders and risk managers and generating alpha.‚Äù Lisher said it‚Äôs one thing if a client wants to invest based on their personal values and they‚Äôre willing to make the tradeoffs, or if a client has a concentrated stock position. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm talking about,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm talking about the notion that personalization has gone too far, I think, erodes the value of really great active management with really great risk management wrapped around it.‚Äù Related:AI Disruption Fear Sparks Investor Scrutiny of Software Stocks She added that direct indexing must be a delicate balance of art and science, and it‚Äôs very difficult to get right. Jaime Magyera, head of BlackRock‚Äôs U.S. Wealth Advisory business, said it comes down to client segments. ‚ÄúFor let‚Äôs call it 80% of investors out there, a strategic asset allocation, long-term asset allocation that‚Äôs diversified across equities and fixed income is the path to success,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThere is a segment‚Äîthat high-net-worth investor, someone who has deep beliefs‚Äîwhere they want to align the S&P 500 but they want to customize that.‚Äù The tax management aspect of direct indexing is designed for high-net-worth investors, she said, who actually have enough capital gains to benefit from the strategy. It‚Äôs not for everyone. ‚ÄúI worry about getting a little overcustomized, overpersonalized and over-direct indexed when a portfolio of ETFs across equity and fixed income with a strategic asset allocation is a very fine solution,‚Äù she said. Kristie Feinberg, president and CEO of Manulife John Hancock Investments, agreed that personalization has different meanings for different people, and that overcustomization could be an issue. But she said there‚Äôs a real benefit to providing tailored solutions, and technology can make it easier. Related:Powell Opens Door to Interest Rate Cut, Citing Labor Markets ‚ÄúI do think there is a real need for personalization within portfolios,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what we do today; we create plans that are personalized. To be able to do that in a way that brings in technology to make it more efficient, to make it more effective, is where you‚Äôre going to see the real power.‚Äù Both BlackRock and J.P. Morgan have made big bets on direct indexing. In 2020, BlackRock announced its acquisition of Aperio, a creator of tailored index strategies. That same year, J.P. Morgan announced plans to acquire 55ip, a fintech startup that provides advisors with automated tax technology and a tax-smart investment strategy engine. BlackRock‚Äôs Magyera said direct indexing is one of the fastest-growing areas of the market, especially for higher-net-worth clients looking for real after-tax returns. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre going to win with that segment, you do need to have differentiated, unique solutions, like direct indexing, like option overlays.‚Äù Diana Britton Executive Editor, WealthManagement.com Diana Britton is the Executive Editor of WealthManagement.com, covering independent broker/dealers and RIAs from all angles.

Title: This 12% CEF Could Be Gen Z‚Äôs Next Investing Obsession

ByMichael Foster, Contributor. We all know that stocks can rise on nothing but hype for long periods. But at the end of the day, it all comes back to one thing: profits! If they don‚Äôt rise, the stock will tank. It‚Äôs just a matter of time. Consider the case of Peloton Interactive (PTON). When the pandemic had everyone exercising indoors, speculators piled into the stock, hoping that soaring earnings would ignite the company‚Äôs value. Peloton‚Äôs net income was deep in the red then. Fast-forward to today, and it‚Äôs still negative. The stock has, of course, dropped to reflect that. What I‚Äôm getting at here is the idea that a stock can gain on hopes of future earnings, but that only lasts for so long. When investors give up hope, losses are inevitable. Of course, that isn‚Äôt the only way to make money in stocks. Those who invest based on the idea that profits will rise in the future can make a profit. Look no further than Peloton itself: Anyone who bought in 2020 with the expectation that demand for that stock would rise in the coming months made a bundle. Indeed, there were over 400% gains within a year for the most aggressive traders. Can we play this supply/demand game with high-yielding assets like closed-end funds (CEFs)? Yes. One way to do so is to buy a CEF when its discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio) is wide, and market fears are peaking. Consider the 27.3% price gain the BlackRock Science and Technology Term Trust (BSTZ), a holding of my CEF Insider service, saw as its discount narrowed from 13% in October 2024 to 7.7% now. The gain in the market price was just part of the story‚ÄîBSTZ‚Äôs NAV also rose. That‚Äôs why CEFs tend to be solid long-term investments: We get upside from the appreciation of the portfolio and gains in the market price as investors bid it up, cutting the discount. I bring all of this up now because I‚Äôm expecting demand for CEFs‚Äîespecially tech-focused CEFs like BSTZ‚Äîto rise in the years ahead. The source of that demand may surprise you: younger investors‚Äîparticularly Generation Z, born between 1997 and 2012. Now, ‚Äúyoung investors‚Äù and ‚Äúdividends‚Äù aren‚Äôt often mentioned in the same sentence, but that‚Äôs changing. Bloomberg recently reported that dividends are increasingly catching young people‚Äôs attention. In a September 4, 2025, article, reporters Denitsa Tsekova and Vildana Hajric write: As a result, Bloomberg reports, Gen Z is moving away from the riskier investments that dominated the headlines in recent years and turning to more staid payouts that older investors have used to obtain financial independence for over a century: dividends! ‚ÄúUnlike meme stocks or crypto moonshots, this strategy‚Äîwhat might be referred to as dividends and chill [italics mine]‚Äî preaches control and consistency, a monthly drip over flash-in-the-pan riches,‚Äù Bloomberg continues. ‚ÄúNot YOLO, just yield.‚Äù There is a key difference between how young and older investors are approaching dividends, however. Right now, according to Bloomberg, Gen Z is focusing on ETFs that ‚Äúoffering eye-popping yields generated by complex derivatives.‚Äù These, of course, come with their own risks. Consider the 66.6%-yielding (not a typo) YieldMax TSLA Option Income Strategy ETF (TSLY), which has attracted a billion dollars in assets because the fund buys Tesla (TSLA) shares, sells covered calls on them, and passes the income to investors. The good news? It isn‚Äôt losing money. The bad news, though, is it‚Äôs returned a paltry 17% in the last three years with dividends reinvested. Nonetheless, an interesting thing is likely to happen as young investors start to collect dividends (even outlandish ones like this): They‚Äôre likely to want more. And when they mature a little, they‚Äôre likely to pivot to sustainable high yields from funds like BSTZ, whose total return (in orange below) that far exceeds that of TSLY over this same time period. Not only does BSTZ boast a high yield and stronger performance than TSLY, but it also trades at that 7.7% discount to NAV, too! (ETFs, for their part, never trade at discounts, as we CEF buyers know well.) It makes no sense for a high-yield, high-return fund like BSTZ to trade for less than the value of its assets. When Gen Z recognizes this, the savviest of them will likely buy in, boosting the fund‚Äôs market price and narrowing its discount. By purchasing BSTZ today, we can set ourselves up to capture the profits from that future demand while we enjoy the fund‚Äôs high yield.

Title: BlackRock eyes tokenized crypto ETFs and stocks ‚Äì Report

Analyst questioned the potential impact of tokenized market BlackRock wants to expand beyond its BUIDL tokenized money market fund and bring crypto ETFs, stocks, and others on-chain. Is the financial market revolution here? BlackRock is reportedly exploring expanding its tokenized product line to cover its popular crypto and other exchange-traded funds (ETFs). According to a report by Bloomberg, the world‚Äôs largest asset manager is mulling going all in on the segment and bringing even stocks on-chain to be traded as digital tokens. However, the plan would be subject to regulatory approval, per the report, citing people familiar with the matter. In less than two years since launching its spot Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH] ETFs, BlackRock‚Äôs crypto holdings have surged to $100 billion. Its first tokenized money market fund, BUIDL (BlackRock USD Institutional Liquidity Fund), was launched in March 2024. Now, the product has a market cap of $2.2 billion, held by 90 firms and is spread across six chains. Early this year, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said, ‚ÄòEvery asset can be tokenized‚Ä¶If that happens, investing will be revolutionized. Markets would never need to close. Settlements would be instantaneous.‚Äù He added that it would be the most ‚Äòdisruptive innovation since ETFs.‚Äô However, some critics still questioned the value of such a move. According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, the ‚Äòon-chain‚Äô group was still too small to warrant the hype. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see the value add for the consumer to get them to switch. ETFs are always underestimated.‚Äù Source: X Interestingly, Nasdaq also asked for the SEC to allow it to list tokenized equities with equal rights as traditional shareholders. That said, tokenized stocks will still be securities, according to SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce. Hence, they must still follow securities law. But the regulators are racing to offer clear rules for the road amid increasing interest in the segment.

FREE MEETING: KEY TRENDS AND RISKS IN TECH GAMES‚Äì REGISTER Minute Media, a sports-focused media holding company backed by BlackRock and Goldman Sachs, has acquired VideoVerse, an Indian AI startup that specializes in extracting highlights and creating content from sports footage. The acquisition, announced on Monday, is considered the largest for Minute Media in terms of value and size. VideoVerse, founded in 2016 by Vinayak Shrivastav, Saket Dandotia, and Alok Patil, has raised $105 million to date from investors such as Bluestone Equity Partners, A91 Partners, Alpha Wave, Evolvence India, and Moneta Ventures. While the exact valuation of the acquisition remains undisclosed, sources indicate that VideoVerse was valued between $200 million and $250 million during its last funding round in 2023. The Mumbai-based startup initially developed various AI tools, including those for detecting smoking and drinking scenes in movies, and object identification for e-commerce sites. However, in 2016, VideoVerse shifted its focus to building video editing and detection tools for sports broadcasters, starting with a project for Hotstar (now owned by Jio) to identify specific action points in cricket. VideoVerse operates as a SaaS tool, charging based on the number of footage hours processed. The company has grown to $65 million in revenue with a healthy EBITDA margin of 35% to 40%. Recently, VideoVerse launched new AI-powered tools that allow clients to automatically generate content by defining rules, such as creating a package of all three-pointers made by a specific basketball player for social media publication. Minute Media plans to leverage VideoVerse‚Äôs technology along with its own publisher network, which includes properties like Sports Illustrated, The Players‚Äô Tribune, and 90 Minutes, to distribute content more effectively and generate ad revenue. The sports media company reaches over 200 million monthly users and offers a B2B platform used by nearly 500 publishers. Asaf Peled, CEO of Minute Media, stated, ‚ÄúWith VideoVerse, we can pitch an AI suite for content creation to our customers, then add our distribution and monetization capabilities to get more value out of the content.‚Äù The acquisition will enable Minute Media to attract more U.S.-based leagues to its highlight-generating platform, responding to a market shift where fans seek diverse content beyond traditional coverage, especially on mobile devices. Peled added that although the company is not actively seeking funding now, it may pursue further funding rounds in the coming quarters for additional acquisitions.

At the same time, Washington is unlikely to force Qatar to expel Hamas leadership entirely, as Doha remains a necessary conduit for hostage and ceasefire talks. For energy, the North Field expansion is still proceeding toward 126 mtpa by 2027, with trains already financed and contractors committed. The risk is more in the realm of perception: insurers, banks, and buyers may begin to build a sovereignty-breach premium into contracts. Watch for whether the Saudis or Emiratis lean toward treating the strike as an aberration or as a tolerated precedent. If they quietly normalize it, markets may read Doha as more exposed. If they close ranks around Qatar‚Äôs sovereignty, that reassures investors that the strike was a one-off shock. By Friday morning, Qatar was kicking the diplomatic posturing into overdrive. It‚Äôs a delicate balancing act. Doha‚Äôs posture has to be precisely calibrated. The foreign ministry denounced the strike as ‚Äústate terrorism‚Äù and vowed legal action. Doha is explicitly putting itself in damage-control mode, trying to preserve its mediation legitimacy while positioning Israel as the aggressor. Qatar needs to show its domestic and regional audience that it will not be cowed, but it also cannot abandon the one role that keeps Washington and European capitals invested in its utility. Doha‚Äôs narrative is that hosting Hamas was always transparent and coordinated with the U.S. and Israel, shifting blame back onto Netanyahu. The calculation is to rally Gulf and Arab partners around sovereignty while reminding Washington that undermining Qatar also undermines hostage and ceasefire channels. Adani Ports, which controls India‚Äôs largest private port network, has now barred any vessel under U.S., EU, or UK sanctions from calling at its facilities. Agents must certify that ships are clean of designations before berthing. Mundra, Adani‚Äôs flagship port, is a key entry point for Russian crude handled by IOC and HPCL-Mittal; those flows will now face new friction. Refiners can reroute via non-Adani ports or source non-designated tonnage, but costs will rise and scheduling will tighten. The move is significant because India‚Äôs formal policy has been to ignore unilateral Western sanctions and only respect UN mandates. A private operator is effectively tightening compliance on its own, underlining the liability calculus of global finance and insurers. Washington will interpret this as success based on Trump‚Äôs pressure. Moscow will see another crack in India‚Äôs ability to shield its imports. For India‚Äôs refiners, the adjustment is immediate: higher freight and insurance premiums, more reliance on gray-fleet tonnage, and the risk of cargo delays. Longer term, it marginally weakens Russia‚Äôs grip on India‚Äôs oil basket and nudges refiners to keep Middle East and African barrels in reserve. Discovery & Development Pakistan Petroleum Ltd (PPL) struck oil again in the Potwar region, chalking up its second big find in the Dhok Sultan Block, District Attock. The Dhok Sultan-03 well, spudded in January and drilled to 5,815m, is the second deepest oil strike in fractured carbonate formations in the area. Initial tests showed strong flows ‚Äî 1,469 bpd oil and 2.56 mmscfd gas on a tighter choke, rising to 2,113 bpd and 4.13 mmscfd on a wider one. PPL holds 75% in the block with Government Holdings (Pvt) Ltd (GHPL) at 25%, calling the discovery a major milestone for both partners. Shell has cut a farm-out deal offshore S√£o Tom√© & Pr√≠ncipe, handing Petrobras big stakes in frontier ultra-deepwater Blocks 10, 11, and 13 while keeping 40% and operatorship. ANP-STP retains 15% across the blocks, with Galp holding 20% in Block 11. The acreage sits in the Gulf of Guinea, an emerging ‚Äúelephant play‚Äù zone that‚Äôs drawing major attention despite its frontier risk. Petrobras sees the move as a way to rebuild reserves and diversify, while Shell trims exposure but stays in control of a potentially giant prize. MOL and O&GD have hit oil at Galgah√©v√≠z-4 in Hungary‚Äôs Mogyor√≥d concession, flowing about 1,000 bpd from 2,400m depth after a 37-day drill. The crude is processed at MOL‚Äôs Danube Refinery, with volumes split 51/49 between O&GD and MOL, and represents roughly 4% of MOL‚Äôs domestic oil output. The find underscores MOL‚Äôs push to boost supply security as Hungary still leans heavily on imports, adding to a string of recent discoveries at Vecs√©s and Somogys√°mson plus 25 shallow gas successes since 2019. The timing dovetails with the 60th anniversary of the Algy? field, still a supply pillar, now being paired with renewables as MOL builds a 37.4 MWp solar park and 40 MWh storage system to cut emissions and green its legacy hub. BP has walked away from the Pau Brasil block in Brazil‚Äôs Santos basin after its much-hyped pre-salt wildcat failed to deliver a commercial find. The company re-entered Brazil in mid-2024 after more than a decade away, drilling with the Valaris DS-15, but results showed only traces of oil in 2,283m water depth. Pau Brasil was part of a production sharing contract, and BP has now relinquished the acreage back to ANP. The move contrasts with BP‚Äôs recent pre-salt success elsewhere in Brazil, showing how hit-or-miss frontier drilling in the basin remains. ReconAfrica has inked a PSC with Gabon for the 1,214 sq km Ngulu Block C-7 in shallow water, positioning itself as operator with 55% alongside Record Resources (20%), Gabon Oil Co. (15%), and the state (10%). The block holds the historic Loba discovery, drilled in 1976 with 140m gross pay, plus 28 mapped prospects in Gamba-Dentale plays likened to the Gulf of Mexico. Recon plans geological work, 3D seismic reprocessing, and at least one well during the initial 4-year term, with an option to extend. Loba alone is thought capable of flowing 20,000 b/d, making the block a potentially material addition to Gabon‚Äôs offshore profile. Mergers and Acquisitions BlackRock and a Gulf-backed consortium are in advanced talks to raise ~$10.3B for Aramco‚Äôs midstream assets, according to sources cited today. The financing push signals strong institutional appetite despite higher global rates, and gives Riyadh another lever to monetize pipelines without ceding equity control. The structure also keeps Western capital tied into Saudi energy infrastructure at a time when Aramco is under pressure to fund expansion, dividends, and domestic megaprojects simultaneously. A $215M merger between Pelican Acquisition, Greenland Exploration, and March GL has created Greenland Energy Co., the first U.S.-listed firm dedicated to developing Greenland‚Äôs Jameson Land Basin. ARCO once spent $275M mapping the basin and left behind 1,800 km of seismic and infrastructure, now reprocessed by March GL to identify 50+ drillable targets. Greenland Energy holds rights to up to 70% of three licenses spanning 2M acres, with Halliburton tapped for drilling and heavy equipment already mobilized for the first well site. Executives pitched the venture as both a watershed for Greenland and a strategic play for U.S. and allied energy security in one of the Arctic‚Äôs richest undrilled basins. Westgate Energy has scrapped its planned $5.1M (C$7M) acquisition of Mannville Stack assets in East-Central Alberta after failing to secure required third-party consents. The vendor returned Westgate‚Äôs C$700K deposit plus interest, ending the deal that would have added 14.5 sections and 57 potential horizontal well locations near Frog Lake. The move comes as Westgate focuses on its own drilling program, where three new wells are still cleaning up and showing promising early rates, with a follow-up campaign at Beaverdam slated for Q4. Management stressed it remains committed to its Mannville Stack growth strategy, calling the play one of the best oil economics in Western Canada. EQV Ventures Acquisition Corp. and Presidio Petroleum have filed with the SEC to merge in a $660M deal that will create Presidio Production Company, a dividend-focused C-Corp set to list on the NYSE under ticker FTW. The transaction is set to close in Q4 2025 and will build on Presidio‚Äôs strategy of optimizing mature, low-decline wells for steady cash flow rather than drilling new ones. Anglo American and Teck are merging in a $50B (¬£36B) deal to form Anglo Teck, headquartered in Vancouver but keeping a London listing. The combined miner will be 70% weighted to copper, with iron ore and zinc rounding out the portfolio, and Anglo shareholders will get a $4.5B special dividend. Anglo will hold 62.4% of the new company, which expects $800M in annual synergies by year four, with CEO Duncan Wanblad leading and Teck‚Äôs Jonathan Price as deputy. The move triggered political backlash in the UK as a hit to London‚Äôs business standing, though investors sent Anglo‚Äôs stock up 7.8% on the news. To access this exclusive content...

Today's top news: Wall Street‚Äôs biggest asset manager is about to take tokenization mainstream. Bloomberg reported that BlackRock is preparing to tokenize ETFs and other real-world asset (RWA) funds, expanding beyond its existing on-chain cash management product, BUIDL. The move is pending regulatory approval, but it represents a major step toward bringing traditional investment vehicles onto blockchain rails. BlackRock launched BUIDL with Securitize in 2024, giving institutions tokenized exposure to U.S. Treasuries. Now, the firm wants to extend that model to ETFs and additional fund structures, which would mark the first time a traditional manager has tokenized mainstream funds at scale. Potential types of funds include: These sectors represent Trillions in assets ($12.5T in Q2 2025 to be exact). And a huge chunk of them (maybe eventually all) are coming on-chain. ‚ÄúJust like everyone downplaying digital assets being proven wrong over the last decade.

And there‚Äôs a real chance that most of these funds are tokenized on Ethereum (where BUIDL is). If that‚Äôs the case, ETH is likely the biggest winner here.

September 12, 2025 06:00 ET | Source: BlackRock Asset Management Canada Limited BlackRock Asset Management Canada Limited TORONTO, Sept. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BlackRock Asset Management Canada Limited (‚ÄúBlackRock Canada‚Äù), an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc. (‚ÄúBlackRock‚Äù) (NYSE: BLK) is announcing changes to two funds. Index Methodology Changes for iShares Exponential Technologies Index ETF The iShares Exponential Technologies Index ETF (‚ÄúXEXP‚Äù) currently seeks to replicate the performance of the Morningstar Exponential Technologies Index (the ‚ÄúIndex‚Äù), net of expenses. XEXP is expected to experience higher than normal portfolio turnover due to upcoming changes to the evaluation process used to determine the composition of the Index. The composition of the Index will change as part of regularly scheduled rebalances (the ‚ÄúRebalances‚Äù) of the Index on September 19, 2025 and December 19, 2025. Morningstar, Inc. (‚ÄúMorningstar‚Äù), the index provider of the Index, announced on June 6, 2025, that: (1) the Index will be reviewed quarterly in March, June, September and December instead of annually in December; (2) the exponential technology themes will be updated to replace the big data & analytics, hyperconnectivity, and energy transition themes with the artificial intelligence, cybersecurity & defense technology and energy innovation themes; the cloud computing and nanotechnology themes will be removed from the Index; and (3) the Index will transition from being an equal weighted index to a float-adjusted market capitalization-weighted index with the weight of each constituent issuer capped at 4% and the weight of each exponential technology theme capped at 25%. As a result of the Rebalances, XEXP may experience higher than normal transaction costs and realize net capital gains. Annual Management Fee Reduction for iShares India Index ETF Effective on September 12, 2025, the annual management fee of the iShares India Index ETF (‚ÄúXID‚Äù) will change as follows: This action is part of the firm‚Äôs regular review of its pricing strategy to reflect continued growth in its product offerings and ability to leverage its scale to benefit investors.

Under the terms of the agreement, a new subsidiary, Jafurah Midstream Gas Company (JMGC), will be responsible for leasing the development and usage rights of gas processing facilities within the Jafurah gas field. These rights will then be leased back to Aramco for a duration of 20 years. This deal follows last month‚Äôs $11bn leaseback agreement involving Aramco‚Äôs Jafurah gas processing facilities.

Aramco intends to increase its gas production capacity by 60% from 2021 to 2030 to address the growing requirement for gas. JMGC will receive tariffs from Aramco in exchange for exclusive rights to process and treat raw gas from the field. Aramco will maintain a 51% ownership in JMGC, with the remaining 49% held by the investor group. The parties involved, including Aramco, BlackRock, JPMorgan, and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking, have declined to comment on the financing details.

(PTI) JioBlackRock Mutual Fund on Thursday said that it would launch its first active equity product, JioBlackRock FlexiCap Fund, on the Systematic Active Equity platform on September 23. However, he did not set any collection target for this fund during the initial offer period. ‚ÄúThis is our first active equity fund. Three or four other active equity funds are in the pipeline, which may see the light of day this fiscal. Other products, including ETFs, will follow in due course,‚Äù JioBlackRock AMC chief investment officer Rishi Kohli said. The fund, built on BlackRock‚Äôs globally proven SAE platform, follows a rules-based and predominantly machine-driven process tracking 400 signals. About 95 per cent of the investment process will be technology-driven, aiming to eliminate key-person risk, reduce cognitive biases, and ensure disciplined fund management. The SAE Flexi-Cap Fund will maintain a controlled active risk of no more than 3-4 per cent, lower than industry averages, with a focus on downside risk protection and consistent returns for investors. Kohli said a 10-year simulation indicated the model could deliver 3-4 per cent outperformance over the benchmark index, similar to results achieved in other BlackRock country funds. ‚ÄúIn an uncertain market environment, where equity markets have been tough, we believe it‚Äôs a good time to launch a product that manages risk on the lower side compared to other active funds and still aims for attractive alpha in the long run,‚Äù Kohli said. JioBlackRock, the partnership between Jio Financials and the world's largest asset managers BlackRock, received its license in May and currently manages around ‚Çπ18,000 crore in assets across eight cash and index funds. The fund house will continue to focus on digital distribution in the near term. The official, however, did not comment on AUM targets or a break-even timeline.

While the crypto market‚Äôs broader bullish sentiment is being driven by the strong possibility of a Federal Reserve rate cut decision, the tokens' rise coincides with BlackRock‚Äôs plans to introduce exchange-traded funds onto public blockchains, Bloomberg reported Wednesday. Ondo is up nearly 10% on the day to $1.10 after clocking more than 21% gains this week, CoinGecko data shows. Thursday's gains follow last week's launch of tokenized versions of more than 100 U.S.-listed stocks, ETFs, and other equities on Ethereum via the DeFi protocol's Global Markets platform. Lai Yuen, investment analyst at Fischer8 Capital, told Decrypt Ondo‚Äôs price rise is likely driven by ‚Äúexcitement around tokenized stocks.‚Äù Onboarded partners and advisors for Ondo‚Äôs Global Markets, which includes the likes of WisdomTree, have helped grow the platform by $160 million in TVL over nine days. That all but ‚Äúunderscores the project‚Äôs strong early traction,‚Äù Yuen said. Ondo Finance's total value locked, meanwhile, has nearly tripled since the start of 2025, growing from $611 million to $1.57 billion, DefiLlama data shows. The long-term outlook remains bullish, according to Yuen, who posits that even if the project captures 10% of the stock market, it would translate to ‚Äúsubstantial fee generation for Ondo token holders.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe project‚Äôs regulatory moat, bolstered by its advisory board, provides a durable long-term advantage that will be difficult for competitors to replicate,‚Äù he said.

Title: Trailblazer Tania Rosser brings a different school of thought to Gonzaga head coach role
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2025/09/12/trailblazer-tania-rosser-brings-a-different-school-of-thought-to-gonzaga-head-coach-role/
Time Published: 2025-09-12T05:00:00Z
Full Content:
It‚Äôs a Thursday afternoon, Tania Rosser is on her way to Gonzaga College in Ranelagh, south Dublin, to take training for the senior cycle rugby players. First though, before they hit the pitches, about 50 of those pupils will do yoga, an innovation she has introduced since taking the position of head coach to the Senior Cup team during the summer. It‚Äôs a statement appointment, and not in a headline-courting manner. In coming through an interview process conducted by principal Damien McCaul and vice principal Stephen Carey, she wasn‚Äôt just the best woman for the position ‚Äì she was the preferred and best applicant. The New Zealand native, who arrived in Ireland 23 years ago, played international rugby across three different codes ‚Äì touch, sevens and XVs. She won 58 caps for Ireland and participated in three World Cups, during the last of which she came out of retirement to help orchestrate Ireland‚Äôs victory over New Zealand in 2014. Rosser was a player-coach at DLSP and Blackrock College, coached J1 (seconds) men‚Äôs team and did skills work with the AIL squad in Clontarf. She coached the women‚Äôs team in Old Belvedere and several of the Irish touch rugby international teams before leading the Leinster women to back-to-back interprovincial titles during a three-year tenure that started in 2021. Her passion for rugby stems from childhood. The youngest of five siblings to Denis and Nancy, she grew up on a ‚Äúmassive farm‚Äù in Hawke‚Äôs Bay before the family subsequently moved into the town of Hastings when she was a little older. Brothers Ray and Dan were sent to boarding school and the only time she got to see them was at rugby matches on weekends. Rosser admits to being the tiresome little sister, a shadow for her brothers who were eight and 10 years older. She wanted to play rugby but her parents forbade it, directing her towards netball and basketball, at which she excelled. She used to sneak out to play rugby until she was caught and grounded. That rebellious streak ‚Äì the refusal to have other people define her boundaries ‚Äì has travelled with her in life. She badgered her father to set up a touch rugby footie team, to legitimise her participation. The first time her parents saw her play rugby was for Ireland in a 43-0 defeat to France at the 2006 World Cup in Edmonton, Canada. She wanted to be a police officer but qualified as a primary schoolteacher at the behest of her mother, who thought the former occupation was too dangerous. She then moved to Ireland with her husband Simon Broughton, who had received a rugby-playing offer from Ballymena in the All-Ireland League. It was supposed to be two years but relocating to Dublin changed the plan. Simon ‚Äì now the Leinster Academy manager ‚Äì played with DLSP and Leinster, as did Tania. Her first coach at the Kilternan club was George Hook. During Covid she enrolled in a high-performance coaching course with World Rugby. Former England and Australia backs coach Scott Wisemantel was one of the mentors, while she got to do online workshops with former Ireland coach Eddie O‚ÄôSullivan and New Zealand mental skills guru Gilbert Enoka. When her three years at Leinster finished, she was on the lookout for another challenge and decided to pursue the position at Gonzaga. Long-time Senior Cup team (SCT) coach Declan Fassbender, who led his alma mater to three Senior Cup finals including a first ever success in 2023, vacated the role to concentrate on coaching Lansdowne. So why Gonzaga? ‚ÄúI just decided to throw my name in, send in my CV in and see what would come of it. ‚ÄúI (was) really disappointed that I couldn‚Äôt keep going with Leinster. So, I was looking for a new challenge and thought why not apply? I got the interview, went in and met the principal and deputy principal and had an honest conversation. They seemed open to it.‚Äù She‚Äôs not the first woman to be involved in coaching an SCT team, even in Ranelagh. Sandford Park school, a middling punt from the entrance to Gonzaga, had former New Zealand sevens and rugby league international Mere Baker ‚Äì she also worked with the Railway Union club at the time ‚Äì as part of their senior coaching team in the early to mid-2010s. Rosser started working with her new charges during the summer. ‚ÄúThe boys started doing strength and conditioning in July, about 40 kids. I thought it would be a good idea to go in, sit with them, meet them one-on-one, find out what‚Äôs driving them, what they like about rugby, what they don‚Äôt like about rugby, just asking them a bit about themselves. ‚ÄúAnd just having that opportunity to say to them, look, my job is to make sure that they‚Äôre okay as people first. If they‚Äôre not well, or if they‚Äôre struggling in school or something, it‚Äôs okay ‚Äì just come and tell me before training, and then we know that you‚Äôre off. ‚ÄúSometimes when these players turn up, we don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happening at home or at school, or if they‚Äôve had a hard day. And a lot of times these kids don‚Äôt get to say it because they‚Äôre too afraid. It‚Äôs taken the boys a while to warm to being open with their feelings but there has been a little purchase of late.‚Äù Rosser‚Äôs principles in coaching young people is refreshing. ‚ÄúMy whole thing is, there has to be life after this (schools rugby) for them. Too many kids don‚Äôt go on and play club rugby after the Senior Cup because they‚Äôre beaten up or broken, or they haven‚Äôt enjoyed it. ‚ÄúSo how can I keep them, give them longevity, because there‚Äôs a long journey in their life and rugby career, if they continue to play club rugby. It‚Äôs just a holistic approach. It‚Äôs probably very different from other Senior Cup teams and I‚Äôm okay with it. I‚Äôm okay with people going ‚Äòshe‚Äôs mad‚Äô or ‚Äòthis is ridiculous‚Äô. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care what people think outside the programme or the environment. I look at doing things differently ‚Äì bringing in yoga, making the boys bring recovery food to every single session before they get on the pitch, checking in with them. ‚ÄúI like using different approaches. I shared with them my journey growing up, you know, facing racism (her mum is Maori), and being on an isolated farm, so they got a sense of who I was. The most important thing I said, the first thing is, I‚Äôm a mum. ‚ÄúBy the time we get through this campaign, you‚Äôll be like my kid. If you need me, if you give me all you can, I‚Äôll always have your back, on and off the pitch. It‚Äôs just how I am with players.‚Äù Rosser looks to empower them on the pitch too. Her coaching operandi is inclusive rather than despotic. She‚Äôs had conversations with the boys, teasing out options for the game plan on the basis that if they don‚Äôt work, they can be discarded. It‚Äôs an interaction that wouldn‚Äôt be commonplace. At home there is a fair amount of rugby talk with Simon as Leinster academy manager and her son Serge, a pupil at St Andrew‚Äôs College and part of the Leinster Under-19s squad. He‚Äôs a scrumhalf, like mum, ‚Äúonly better‚Äù, in her words. He‚Äôs named after the great French fullback Serge Blanco, whom both his parents loved as a player. Serge was very nearly called Fionn. Tania couldn‚Äôt pronounce the name adequately with her Kiwi accent, so her then-Ireland rugby teammates advised her not to go there. She‚Äôs never been cowed by how others perceive her and is excited for what lies ahead. Rosser doesn‚Äôt look at glass ceilings, she just does what she has to do because it never occurred to her not to. She has encountered misogyny, asked whether she was the physio or the manager, but it doesn‚Äôt ruffle her savoir-faire. In the past, she‚Äôs noticed that ‚Äúbetween a male counterpart in my role and myself, I‚Äôd say that the male counterpart gets things a lot easier than I would‚Äù. She added: ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm okay with that. I‚Äôm okay with working to try and break down barriers. I‚Äôll push the boundaries as far as I can, ask questions and try to make things better for our set-up.‚Äù The Gonzaga boys will be the latest beneficiaries of that mindset. From her childhood days, she‚Äôs had to persuade people to give her an opportunity and that she‚Äôd take care of the rest. The level of success that ensued speaks for itself. A trailblazer and a woman for others, to tweak the Jesuit mantra. ¬© 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Avalanche Targets $1 Billion Fundraising Goal For Two AVAX Treasuries

The Avalanche Foundation, a non-profit organization that supports the Avalanche (AVAX) blockchain ecosystem, is reportedly seeking to raise $1 billion through a major fundraising campaign to create two AVAX treasuries. This initiative aligns with a broader trend in the cryptocurrency space, where various organizations and traditional finance firms are experimenting with crypto treasury models to strengthen their financial stability and operational capabilities. According to the Financial Times, the Avalanche Foundation is in advanced talks to create two crypto treasuries in the United States. These moves come at a time when the foundation is gaining traction among institutional investors, with firms like BlackRock and Visa already utilizing the Avalanche blockchain for their operations. The foundation‚Äôs strategy involves launching one digital asset treasury company while converting an existing firm into a treasury vehicle. The goal is to secure approximately $1 billion, with the expectation to finalize these deals within weeks. The funds raised are earmarked for the acquisition of millions of AVAX tokens, which will be offered at a discounted price directly from the Avalanche Foundation. This approach is aimed to not only support the foundation‚Äôs growth but also to enhance the liquidity and market presence of AVAX amid an increasingly competitive treasury companies landscape. Per the report, the first fundraising deal aims to secure up to $500 million through a private investment led by Hivemind Capital, with expectations to finalize the agreement by the end of the month. Notably, Anthony Scaramucci, a crypto investor and former White House press secretary, is advising on this initiative. The second funding endeavor involves a special purpose acquisition vehicle (SPAC) sponsored by Dragonfly Capital, which is also targeting a $500 million raise. This deal may take longer to conclude, potentially stretching into October. Both initiatives will focus on purchasing discounted AVAX tokens held by the Avalanche Foundation, which has a total supply of 720 million tokens, with approximately 420 million currently circulating. The broader cryptocurrency market has seen a surge in fundraising activities this year. Companies have raised over $16 billion to stockpile crypto assets, often inspired by the successful Bitcoin (BTC) treasury model of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy). Tokens associated with other blockchains, such as Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), have also seen significant price increases. These tokens were selected by major publicly traded companies in the US for their respective crypto-focused treasuries. Although AVAX has not experienced the same upward momentum, CoinGecko data shows that it has recorded gains of up to 17% in the weekly time frame. As of this writing, the AVAX price is approaching the key $30 mark, a level not seen since February of this year.

Valuations remain neutral, and our models indicate that the economy has entered a risk-recovery cycle. Having deployed ~15% cash and moderately raised portfolio beta, we believe the major overhang from tariff uncertainty and FII selling is largely behind us. Strong domestic macros‚Äîrobust GDP growth, GST reforms, tax and rate cuts, low inflation, healthy liquidity, supportive DXY and bond yields, alongside peaked-out downgrades and mutual fund cash levels at 5‚Äì6%‚Äîall point to a firm base for Indian equities. While global risks persist, the improving US-India dialogue, stable domestic inflows, and improving factor spreads set the stage for a broad-based recovery over the next 12‚Äì18 months*. This makes it an opportune time to shift from a defensive to a moderately aggressive stance. Given the low factor spread regime, we are running a balanced multi-factor profile, unlike in the past when we adopted larger style tilts. Large- and mid-caps remain our core focus at ~80% allocation (40% each), with small-caps kept below 20%. Sectorally, our overweight remains in Materials and Financials, supported by selective exposure to Consumption (Discretionary), Industrials, Autos, and Healthcare. Within Financials, we prefer Capital Markets, AMCs, and select NBFCs; within Materials, Metals, Mining, Cement, and Chemicals continue to offer attractive growth and valuation opportunities. Recent portfolio winners include AB Capital, LTF, Radico, HDFC AMC, Endurance, MOSL, Bharti Airtel, Chalet Hotels, Hindalco, Tata Steel, and GMDC‚Äù. India‚Äôs equity benchmarks are likely to open higher on Friday, tracking global gains, as softer US jobs data overshadowed a hotter-than-expected inflation reading and bolstered bets for Federal Reserve rate cuts. Gift Nifty futures were trading at 25,194 points as of 07:58 a.m. IST, indicating that the benchmark Nifty 50 will open above Thursday‚Äôs close of 25,005.5. The number of Americans filing for jobless benefits rose sharply last week, confirming the softness in the labour market, while US retail inflation rose 0.4 per cent month-on-month in August. Indian equity benchmarks set to open higher on Friday, driven by global gains and expectations of Fed rate cuts. The stock of ‚ÄãTata Technologies ‚Äãhas appreciated 4.5 per cent so far this week. On Wednesday, it broke out of the resistance at ‚Çπ690, and the price is now above both 21- and 50-day moving averages. Also, the price action shows that the stock has formed a higher high. ‚ÄãStock to buy today: Tata Technologies (‚Çπ701.70)Tata Technologies stock outlook is bullish with a target of ‚Çπ775, buy at ‚Çπ700, accumulate at ‚Çπ690, stop-loss at ‚Çπ665.‚Äã Tata Technologies stock outlook is bullish with a target of ‚Çπ775, buy at ‚Çπ700, accumulate at ‚Çπ690, stop-loss at ‚Çπ665.
