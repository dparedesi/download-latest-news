Polygon has laid out an ambitious scaling roadmap to reach 100,000 transactions per second (TPS), beginning with a July upgrade that will bring the network to 1,000 TPS. The roadmap comes a day after Polygon announced a governance revamp and shift in focus to Agglayer. Dubbed the “Gigagas” roadmap, the initiative is focused on making Polygon the go-to blockchain for real-world financial applications. It culminates in a long-term plan to power global-scale payments and tokenized assets. The July Bhilai Upgrade will introduce 1,000+ TPS throughput, reduce transaction finality to ~5 seconds, and stabilize gas fees under $0.001 per transaction without increasing validator requirements. In a separate development, the network’s native token POL became available on Solana (SOL) via Wormhole Bridge on June 12. By the end of this year, Polygon expects to scale past 5,000 TPS using a new Validator-Elected Block Producer (VEBloP) model that streamlines block production with stateless validation and a single leader architecture. This approach removes the risk of chain reorganizations by guaranteeing one-block finality, a key requirement for institutions and financial applications demanding predictable execution. Polygon said that the 5,000 TPS benchmark has already been achieved in a devnet environment, with technical proposals (PIP-64 and others) outlining the pathway to mainnet rollout. Alongside this upgrade, Polygon will also integrate with Agglayer, a multichain interoperability layer powered by POL staking that allows seamless liquidity movement across chains. In 2026 and beyond, Polygon’s goal is to exceed 100,000 TPS through continued optimization of its validator network and deeper integration with Agglayer. It will also focus on scaling for high-volume use cases like retail payments, AI-driven microtransactions, and tokenized financial markets. The network aims to match the reliability and speed of traditional payment systems while preserving decentralization. Polygon already ranks among the top chains in stablecoin and RWA activity, with over $134 billion in stablecoin transfer volume in April and hundreds of millions in institutional RWAs deployed by firms like Apollo and BlackRock. However, the Polygon team said the chain needs to scale “an order of magnitude higher” to support trillions in on-chain value. The Gigagas roadmap signals a shift from theoretical scaling to real-world execution and positions Polygon as a high-throughput infrastructure layer for the next wave of blockchain adoption.

Title: Strategy, GameStop Lead $50 Billion Institutional Surge Into Bitcoin as Treasury Asset

Highlights Bitcoin has evolved from a niche asset to a mainstream institutional-grade investment, with Fortune 500 companies, like Strategy and GameStop among others, allocating billions to bitcoin holdings, transforming corporate treasuries into crypto-forward financial operations. Companies are leveraging complex financial instruments (e.g., convertible notes, structured products, bitcoin-backed loans) to gain crypto exposure, potentially blurring the line between financial innovation and speculative risk. The role of corporate treasurers is expanding beyond traditional finance to include crypto expertise, risk governance, and digital asset strategy, prompting a critical reevaluation of bitcoin's place on balance sheets — as a hedge, speculative asset, or branding signal — based on a company’s unique financial profile. In the early days of bitcoin, it was hard to imagine Fortune 500 treasury teams doing anything more than monitoring its unpredictable price swings out of casual interest.

Δ But 15 years and several bull-bear cycles later, the cryptocurrency is no longer just the domain of technologists and retail investors. It’s evolving into an institutional-grade asset. Not just in theory, but in practice. Fortune 500 blockchain adoption has allegedly now hit 60% with institutions injecting as much as $50 billion into crypto funds in Q1. Leading the pack is the one-time software company Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), which has compiled a war chest of 580,000 bitcoin, worth about $63 billion, since the middle of 2020, with its latest purchase coming within the past two weeks. Strategy has transformed itself into a bitcoin treasury company and is now primarily in the business of selling securities to raise money to buy the cryptocurrency. Far from being viewed as a black sheep, the company’s “bitcoin treasury” approach has spurred a wave of publicly traded copycats. GameStop, for example, on Wednesday (June 11) announced it was issuing $1.75 billion in convertible notes to buy bitcoin. This followed an earlier Q1 acquisition of 4,710 BTC (about $513 million), which made GameStop the 13th‑largest corporate holder. Elsewhere, The Blockchain Group, which describes itself as Europe’s first bitcoin treasury company, on Monday (June 9) announced a $300 million issuance for, you guessed it, the purposes of purchasing more bitcoin. From structured notes and hedging instruments to yield-bearing custodial accounts and even Bitcoin-backed loans, the ecosystem is diversifying at a pace few anticipated. But beneath the innovation lies a familiar tension: are these truly risk-managed tools for corporate finance, or cleverly packaged speculative bets in disguise? Read also: Making Sense of Bitcoin’s Growing Relevance for Corporate Treasuries Milestones like the launch of CME Bitcoin futures (2017), the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. (2024), and the entrance of traditional financial institutions like Fidelity, BlackRock, and JPMorgan into the crypto arena have provided a sense of legitimacy. With regulatory clarity slowly improving, especially around custody and reporting standards, corporate finance professionals are being offered a potential new value proposition: the cryptocurrency not as a gamble, but as a balance sheet diversification strategy. As PYMNTS covered, even the Ivy-league institution Brown University has recently disclosed a $4.9 million investment in BlackRock’s bitcoin ETF, signaling a broader acceptance of cryptocurrencies in diversified portfolios. After all, the CLARITY Act, which aims to establish a regulatory framework for digital assets and crypto markets in the U.S., is set to be considered by the full U.S. House of Representatives after being advanced by two House committees Tuesday (June 10). At the same time, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) wants to ease restrictions governing decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. The treasurer’s role in this environment? It’s no longer merely about cash, FX, or interest rate swaps — but increasingly about whether the CFO team has the infrastructure, expertise, risk governance, and capital strategies to harness any crypto strategy judiciously. See also: Are Crypto Markets Going Mainstream? What Treasury Execs Should Know Bitcoin is maturing into a multi-dimensional treasury instrument: a defensive store-of-value, a potential yield generator and a signal of corporate innovation. But behind the headlines and bold plays lies a complex ecosystem rich with financing engineering, volatility exposure, regulatory uncertainty, and governance pitfalls. After all, for all the innovation, there’s a critical issue at the heart of this trend: are these financial tools being used to serve prudent corporate strategy, or are they a new flavor of speculative risk? Some critics argue that bitcoin-linked treasury products may be less about strategic diversification and more about corporate speculation dressed in financial engineering. Today’s suite of corporate crypto offerings are designed to mitigate some of the risks. But in doing so, they can sometimes introduce new forms of complexity — particularly around counterparty risk, liquidity constraints and regulatory uncertainty. The accounting treatment of crypto assets remains a thorny issue. In the U.S., bitcoin is still classified as an intangible asset, meaning unrealized losses must be recognized, but gains can’t be booked unless the asset is sold. This creates a lopsided risk profile for public companies. Perhaps the central question for corporate treasurers is this: What is bitcoin in the context of the corporate balance sheet? Is it a modern hedge against fiat inflation, akin to gold? A speculative instrument that can juice short-term returns but introduces material downside? Or a strategic signaling tool — part financial asset, part branding exercise? The answer may depend on the type of business and its risk profile. For a tech-forward firm with high margins and a long investment horizon, limited bitcoin exposure may offer a form of asymmetric upside. For a capital-intensive industrial company with tight liquidity, it may be an unjustifiable risk.

Share this article BlackRock is aiming to become the world’s dominant crypto asset manager by 2030, targeting at least $50 billion in assets under management (AUM) through its digital asset offerings, according to a Thursday presentation on its website. For its flagship crypto ETFs, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), BlackRock’s goal is to lead their respective categories by AUM. IBIT has already secured the top spot among spot Bitcoin ETFs, managing over $73 billion in assets as of June 11. ETHA also leads the spot Ethereum ETF group, with a $4.3 billion market cap, ahead of Grayscale’s ETHE. On global expansion, the asset management giant targets to expand its digital asset exchange-traded products (ETPs) beyond the US into Europe and Canada. Following its successful launch of IBIT in the US last year, BlackRock rolled out its first Bitcoin ETP in Europe in March 2025. The fund trades under the ticker IB1T on major European exchanges, including Xetra, Euronext Paris, and Euronext Amsterdam. The fund is BlackRock’s first crypto-linked ETP outside North America. In addition to this, BlackRock offers the iShares Bitcoin ETF on Cboe Canada. In the tokenization space, BlackRock’s BUIDL fund remains central to the firm’s long-term digital asset strategy According to rwa.xyz, BUIDL leads the tokenized US Treasury market with approximately $3 billion in assets as of June 11.

Title: ONDO’s TVL hit new ATH with Ripple partnership – Will prices follow?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/ondos-tvl-hit-new-ath-with-ripple-partnership-will-prices-follow/
Time Published: 2025-06-12T03:00:08Z

Despite the ONDO x Ripple partnership, the two cryptocurrencies did not react instantly. Ondo Finance [ONDO] continued to lead in the Real World Asset space with its recent partnership with Ripple’s XRP Ledger to enable 24/7 access through the RLUSD stablecoin. The partnership of Ondo Finance and Ripple has seen the tokenization of the U.S. Treasuries cross stay at the XRP Ledger with 24/7 get right of entry to and redemption in RLUSD. The mixing was enabled via the BUIDL fund, a BlackRock initiative, making ONDO the hub of institutional DeFi infrastructure. But this was not merely a story game — this was operational capital investment in the quest of scalable income. ONDO sprang a new all-time high on its Total Value Locked of $1.368B. This was more than $20 million in additional growth since the previous milestone. Source: DefiLlama The market cap was equal to $2.824 billion, and the daily volume was $167.02 million. The revenue was less impressive though — annualized fees stood at $54.24 million. The platform revenue was $11.69 million as holders continued to get in revenue share. That was indicative of the growth momentum in ONDO but also indicative of the absence of direct holder returns, which may become an issue as the sector matures. Nevertheless, as the XRPL integration went live and the TVL was increasing, the strategy of ONDO proved to bring results. This was in terms of bringing real-world assets to DeFi rails. The extent to which it can maintain this rate will relate to its success in balancing institutional attractiveness with community incentives. Technically, ONDO kept increasing along the trendline, and the support as it approached the $0.867 area. The price was circling around $0.88 and indication of pressure was seen as price retested trendline. Provided this support beneath ONDO held, it may rebound back to the $0.90 area and even come a second time to challenge the swing high at around $0.98. Nevertheless, a decrease to the levels under $0.867 could result in the pullback to $0.84 or even deeper. The MACD indicated a deteriorating bullish trend, with the MACD line falling below the signal line ($0.0053) and heading into negative territory. This reversal indicated possible near term weakness unless momentum could get restored. Source: Trading View The trend structure was intact in the meantime, though a confirmed break below the rising support would turn the sentiment bearish. The traders may observe $0.867 and $1 as directional validation areas. Meanwhile, the price of XRP on the other hand saw modest gains in the last 24 hours while maintaining its stay around the $2.30 zone. This stressed that the partnership did not have direct impact on prices of the crypto in the short-term but would in the long-term.

Title: XRP Ledger Adds BlackRock-Backed Treasuries In Ripple Deal
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-ledger-blackrock-backed-treasuries-ripple-deal/
Time Published: 2025-06-12T01:30:20Z

The XRP Ledger (XRPL) moved from theory to production-grade finance today as Ondo Finance switched on its tokenized US Treasury fund, Ondo Short-Term US Government Treasuries (OUSG), directly on the network. The launch lets Qualified Purchasers mint or redeem OUSG around the clock by settling with Ripple’s enterprise-grade stablecoin RLUSD, effectively marrying BlackRock-custodied Treasury bills to a 24/7 public chain and its native decentralized exchange. OUSG is no boutique proof-of-concept. The fund already commands more than $670 million in total value locked and sits alongside BlackRock’s own BUIDL and Franklin Templeton’s FOBXX at the top of the rapidly expanding tokenized-Treasury league table. Ondo’s broader real-world-asset (RWA) platform manages roughly $1.3 billion, but this is its first deployment on a non-EVM chain—an endorsement of XRPL’s purpose-built tokenization rails. Institutional investors create or redeem OUSG in a single transaction by delivering or receiving RLUSD, Ripple’s dollar-pegged stablecoin that settles natively on XRPL. Because RLUSD itself moves in finality within three to five seconds, OUSG subscriptions bypass legacy cutoff times and traditional bank wires. Ripple and Ondo have committed liquidity to market-make both legs—RLUSD ↔ USD off-chain and RLUSD ↔ OUSG on-chain—so investors can scale in or out without slipping on spreads. The entire flow remains permissioned at the edges and permissionless in the core. Qualified Purchasers authenticate through Ondo’s compliance portal (leveraging Decentralized Identifiers and verifiable credentials), receive an allow-list flag on-chain, and then interact with the built-in DEX like any other asset pair. Settlement remains atomic: OUSG units burn or mint the moment RLUSD transfers, eliminating the daylight-risk gap that plagues traditional T-plus settlement cycles. XRPL’s deterministic order book, low fees, and native token-issuance primitives spare issuers the need to bolt on smart-contract wrappers for basic custody logic. Forthcoming Multi-Purpose Tokens (MPTs) will allow OUSG to embed cash-flow rights and compliance fences at the protocol level, while the planned lending protocol will let desks rehypothecate OUSG as repo collateral without bridging to another chain. Permissioned Domains will give asset managers namespace-level control over who trades within walled gardens—a prerequisite for regulated liquidity pools. For treasury teams juggling intraday cash buffers, tokenized bills on XRPL unlock immediate redeployment of idle dollars. A fund manager who redeems OUSG at 21:00 ET on a Friday receives RLUSD within seconds and can cycle into overnight reverse-repo, stablecoin liquidity farming, or FX settlement in Asia before traditional markets even open. Conversely, corporates that sweep surplus RLUSD into OUSG every evening now capture US Treasury yield without operational drag. Markus Infanger, SVP of RippleX, framed the launch as a watershed: “Ondo’s OUSG going live on the XRPL demonstrates that tokenized finance is no longer theoretical—it’s maturing in real markets. Institutions can now access high-quality assets like US Treasuries on public blockchains, with the compliance and efficiency they need. This represents progress in bringing trusted financial assets into a 24/7 market—enabling greater liquidity, operational efficiency, and faster access to capital.” Ripple and Boston Consulting Group’s joint report projects that tokenization will convert $19 trillion of real-world assets into programmable instruments by 2033. Treasuries have emerged as the beachhead: they are low-risk, deeply liquid, and already digitized in the Federal Reserve’s master ledger, making them ideal for the first wave of on-chain replication. Total tokenized-Treasury value has surged past $7 billion this year, more than doubling since January, and is on track to eclipse the entire stablecoin float of 2017 by year-end. OUSG’s migration to XRPL could accelerate that trend. BlackRock’s BUIDL fund—the underlying asset pool into which OUSG deposits—distributes interest daily and permits same-day stablecoin redemptions, giving on-chain holders a money-market-fund experience without bank-hour limitations. By anchoring that mechanism in XRPL’s always-on settlement layer, Ripple and Ondo have effectively created a composable Treasury bill that “plugs and plays” with any XRPL-native application. The immediate roadmap is functional rather than speculative: open a secondary RLUSD-OUSG order book on XRPL’s DEX, integrate OUSG as collateral in XRPL-based lending markets once live, and extend mint-and-burn access to additional Qualified Purchaser jurisdictions as regulators sign off on the identity stack. Longer term, Ripple plans to use RLUSD as the hub currency for other RWAs—starting with commercial paper and municipal notes—turning XRPL into a full-spectrum capital-markets substrate.

By Madalaine Elhabbal Washington, D.C. Newsroom, Jun 11, 2025 / 18:18 pm Allegations of sexual abuse of minors within the Catholic Church in Ireland significantly spiked this past year, a newly published report has found. The total number of allegations rose by more than 50% from 252 in 2023-2024 to 385 in 2024-2025, according to the latest report by the National Board for Safeguarding Children in the Catholic Church in Ireland. The figure represents the highest number since the organization began publishing annual reports on child sexual abuse in the Irish Church in 2009. The majority of these allegations, 73%, date to the period between 1960 and 1989, with only two cases relating to the period after 2000. Forty-seven cases had no time frame attributed to them. According to the report, which covers allegations from April 1, 2024, to March 31, 2025, the increase in allegations took place predominantly in September 2024 immediately following the announcement of a government-sponsored investigation examining historical abuse in religious-run day and boarding schools in Ireland. “These events in September 2024 appear to have given individuals renewed strength to tell of their experiences,” National Board CEO Aidan Gordon said in a June 10 press release. According to the report, 291 of the allegations received by the National Board were categorized as sexual abuse as the primary complaint. The report records 55 additional allegations of physical abuse, four boundary violations, one count of neglect, one emotional abuse, one bullying, and 32 cases where the alleged abuse was not categorized. The report indicates that 385 allegations were made against 376 people, including 318 male religious, 39 diocesan priests, 16 female religious, and three males of unknown affiliation. Of the 39 diocesan priests accused of abuse, 20 (64%) are deceased, three are laicized, three are in prison, four are out of ministry, four are under a management plan, one remains in active ministry, and four are of unknown status. Of the remaining accused, 221 of them are deceased, five are laicized, five are in active ministry, 31 are in prison, 21 are under a management plan, 12 have left the Church, 17 are out of ministry, and 22 are of unknown status. The National Board received 287 requests for advice in relation to safeguarding children from abuse within the Church in 2024-2025. The announcement of the Irish government’s September 2024 investigation came after the government-backed scoping inquiry, published in March 2023. The inquiry was initiated in the aftermath of a 2022 radio documentary called “Blackrock Boys,” which revealed extensive abuse at the Spiritan-run Blackrock College, a boys’ boarding and day school in Dublin. The scoping inquiry revealed that 2,395 allegations of abuse had been made in 308 schools between 1927 and 2013, including extensive accounts of sexual abuse, rape, and sexual assault. Bishop Kevin Doran of Elphin described the scoping inquiry as “a tragedy” at the time, lamenting not only the sheer number of allegations in the report but also “that so many of them had to carry their experience alone for so many years before they felt sufficiently free to tell someone else.” (Story continues below) Your monthly donation will help our team continue reporting the truth, with fairness, integrity, and fidelity to Jesus Christ and his Church. The Dublin-based Iona Institute for Religion and Society has released a comprehensive report that highlights significant shifts in religious attitudes and practices in Ireland. The announcement comes as a report from the Irish government revealed that 2,395 allegations of abuse had been made in 308 schools between 1927 and 2013. A recent Eucharistic procession in Derry, Ireland, highlighted an inspiring revival of Catholic faith in a city synonymous with some dark days in Ireland’s troubled history.

Payments platform Stripe has announced its acquisition of a crypto wallet provider shortly after closing a $1 billion deal to purchase the stablecoin firm Bridge. In a post on the social media platform X, crypto wallet company Privy says it’s been bought out by Stripe, a firm that provides payment infrastructure for businesses. “Today, we’re proud to announce that Stripe is acquiring Privy. We couldn’t be more excited. Privy will continue as an independent product – but now we’ll move faster, ship more, and serve you even better, so you can stay focused on your users.” Earlier this year, Stripe completed its purchase of stablecoin issuer Bridge, the company behind USDB, a programmable dollar-pegged crypto asset backed by a combination of cash and money market funds held by BlackRock. As stated by Zach Abrams, co-founder of Bridge, at the time, “We closed our acquisition with Stripe! Together we’re scaling digital dollars to businesses everywhere. Stablecoins aren’t the future- they’re already transforming how people move money today.” Earlier this month, Stripe reportedly was in talks with unnamed banks regarding their potential use of stablecoins. Stripe co-founder and president John Collison said that banks seem eager to work with dollar-pegged digital assets. “In the conversations we have with them, they’re very interested. This is not something that banks are just kind of brushing away or treating as a fad. Banks are very interested in how they should be integrated with stablecoins into their product offerings as well.” Featured Image: Shutterstock/DEYASA_346 Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

Title: Ivies, Index Funds, And Incarceration: How Universities Became Financial Stakeholders In The Prison Economy

ByMichelle Mbekeani ByMichelle Mbekeani, Contributor. Nashville, Tennessee USA - May 10, 2022: Entrance sign to the private research school Vanderbilt ... More University located in the west end district The private prison industry did not emerge fully formed from a corporate boardroom. It was seeded quietly, often indirectly, by capital from university endowments. American universities, as institutional investors, have long shaped emerging markets by deploying billions through private equity, hedge funds, and index‑tracking portfolios. At the time, these decisions drew minimal public scrutiny, guided by fiduciary responsibility, and framed as financially neutral. But universities’ expanding financial footprints have exposed them, directly and indirectly, to sectors with profound social implications. Now, amid growing demand for transparency and responsible investing, students, faculty, and alumni are asking: What systems have our institutions funded, and at what cost? Seed Money and the Rise of Private Prisons The modern private prison industry traces back to the early 1980s, when governments sought alternatives amid rising incarceration rates. The model: privately operated correctional facilities financed through government contracts. In 1983, Corrections Corporation of America (now CoreCivic) was launched by former Chairman of the Tennessee Republican Party, Thomas W. Beasley, with formative investments that included Vanderbilt University, the Tennessee Lookout reported. I have reached out to Vanderbilt University for comment and will update the post if I receive a reply. Three years later, CoreCivic executed its initial public offering (IPO) in October 1986, listing 2 million shares on the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol CCAX at an offering price of $9.00 per share. In December 1994, the company transitioned its listing to the New York Stock Exchange, where it began trading under the symbol CXC, signaling its maturation into a more established publicly traded entity. Today the corporation runs over 100 facilities nationwide. According to its 2024 Annual Report, the company reported $2.0 billion in revenue and $68.9 million in net income. CoreCivic continues to derive a significant portion of its revenue from federal contracts, including those with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which has expanded to support mass deportation efforts of the Trump administration. Its main competitor, The GEO Group, earned $2.424 billion in revenue and reported $31.97 million in net income in 2024, as detailed in their 2024 Annual Report. ETF Exposure and Indirect Investment Although universities like Vanderbilt have since disavowed direct holdings in private prison companies, some universities may still have indirect exposure within passive index funds. This indirect retention of financial ties stems from exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and passive investment vehicles managed by BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street. An analysis by OpenSecrets highlighted that broad real estate ETFs—like Vanguard’s VNQ and BlackRock’s IYR, include private prison Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), such as CoreCivic in their holdings. ETFs are commonly used by university endowments for low-fee diversification. Because ETFs weight their portfolios based on sector representation, not ethical considerations, private prison companies could be bundled alongside shopping malls, office parks, and senior housing properties. That means universities pursuing passive real estate ETFs can unknowingly gain financial exposure to incarceration-related businesses. While some institutions have moved to ESG-screened portfolios, much of the endowment landscape remains opaque, structured through fund-of-funds vehicles and outsourced managers. According to the 2023 NACUBO-Commonfund Study of Endowments, U.S. colleges and universities manage around $839 billion in endowment assets, with a mean immediate return of 7.7%. Procurement: University Purchases from Prison Labor University interactions with the carceral system extend beyond financial markets. Some universities procure goods from prison labor programs—furniture, garments, and institutional supplies made by incarcerated workers. According to a 2020, Inside Higher Ed report, some of the furniture at the University of Virginia was made in prisons, and so was some of the furniture at George Mason University and the University of Mary Washington. This requirement stemmed from a statewide mandate at the time, requiring all public universities in Virginia to purchase furniture from Virginia Correctional Enterprises (VCE), a state-owned entity that employs approximately 1,300 incarcerated individuals, Inside Higher Ed reported. These types of procurement mandates and restrictions tend to be governed by state-level governments and their statutory and administrative codes, as opposed to university-level administration. I have reached out to each university for comment and will update the post if I receive a reply. Madison, Wisconsin, USA-May 4, 2023: The University of Wisconsin campus in Madison, Wisconsin, USA In some states, public universities have a history of being mandated by their state government to buy prison made furniture. According to the 2020, Inside Higher Ed report, University of Wisconsin campuses have in the past been required to purchase from Badger State Industries, Wisconsin’s prison labor enterprise. According to the ACLU, some incarcerated workers earn as little as $0.13 per hour and many earn nothing at all. The Prison Policy Initiative notes wages range from $0.33 to $1.41 per hour. I have reached out to each university for comment and will update the post if I receive a reply. Institutional Values Follow the Money Capital is not neutral. Where it flows, systems follow. Universities are not merely academic institutions, they are powerful economic actors. Through investments and procurement, many have become stakeholders in the carceral system, often unintentionally. As debates around racial justice, incarceration, and institutional accountability gain momentum, the financial ties between higher education and the prison industry continue to encounter scrutiny. The pressing question is not whether these ties exist, it is whether universities can redesign their capital frameworks to reflect their values.

Title: World Bank Agrees with President Trump Position of Unsustainable, Unbalanced Trade Status – Global Trade Taking Advantage of USA

Skip to comments. Posted on 06/11/2025 11:38:45 AM PDT by SoConPubbie This is actually a very surprising development. The World Bank (WB) is a heavily controlled multinational exploit of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and World Economic Forum assembly (WEF). This could be looked upon as the WTO/WEF taking a knee as they finally accept Godzilla Trump is not going to relent. Remember, the Build Back Better agenda was a construct from the WEF/WTO.Looking a little more deeply at the people behind the latest shift in tone and paying close attention to the wording they are using, there’s an inference the World Bank is telling Europe to stop being intransigent or they will lose U.S. military support. A very unusual shift in WB tone.In my first review opinion, as the legal arbitration system for trade complaints, the WB are trying to mitigate President Trump’s full-frontal assault on the global trade imbalance that brings the global trade wealth back to the USA.NEW YORK POST […] – Top economists at the international institution, which helps finance low and middle-income countries, acknowledged that many nations do not provide reciprocal trade access to the US.“This [situation] could not be sustained indefinitely,” the World Bank’s chief economist, Indermit Gill, said during a news briefing, the Washington Post reported.[Gill] contended that Trump’s actions were merely a response to uneven trade access between other countries and the US.Other experts at the World Bank concurred with that assessment and indicated that Europe, Japan and China should all take steps to reduce trade barriers on the US, while calling for an across-the-board rollback on tariffs on all sides.

A very unusual shift in WB tone.In my first review opinion, as the legal arbitration system for trade complaints, the WB are trying to mitigate President Trump’s full-frontal assault on the global trade imbalance that brings the global trade wealth back to the USA.NEW YORK POST […] – Top economists at the international institution, which helps finance low and middle-income countries, acknowledged that many nations do not provide reciprocal trade access to the US.“This [situation] could not be sustained indefinitely,” the World Bank’s chief economist, Indermit Gill, said during a news briefing, the Washington Post reported.[Gill] contended that Trump’s actions were merely a response to uneven trade access between other countries and the US.Other experts at the World Bank concurred with that assessment and indicated that Europe, Japan and China should all take steps to reduce trade barriers on the US, while calling for an across-the-board rollback on tariffs on all sides.

Title: Bitcoin Poised For Rally To $1 Million, Says Michael Saylor — Here’s What Will Catalyze The Epic Ascent
URL: https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-poised-for-rally-to-1-million-says-michael-saylor-heres-what-will-catalyze-the-epic-ascent/
Time Published: 2025-06-11T18:14:43Z
Full Content:
Michael Saylor, cofounder and the executive chairman of Bitcoin-powered giant Strategy, has ruled out the chances of a full-blown crypto winter returning, at least not anytime soon. Crypto winter, as widely known within the cryptosphere, is a period typically characterized by a cruel correction in Bitcoin prices. According to Saylor, BTC is not going to $0 but is headed towards the $1 million per coin coveted milestone based on a number of key factors that he believes will supercharge the price of the oldest cryptocurrency. Speaking to Bloomberg on Tuesday, Michael Saylor highlighted that roughly 450 Bitcoin (BTC) are minted by miners every day. At current Bitcoin prices of $109,559 as per CoinGecko, that amount is equivalent to around $50 million. “If that $50 million is bought, then the price has got to move up,” Saylor posited. The Bitcoin bull further noted that the increasing number of public companies adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets is buying “the entire natural supply.” Saylor’s software intelligence-turned Bitcoin Treasury firm Strategy has amassed 582,000 BTC since it started purchasing in 2020, which is valued at around $63.59 billion, according to Saylor Tracker data. “At the current price level, it only takes $50 million to turn the entire driveshaft of the crypto economy one turn.” Notably, Saylor acknowledged that if Bitcoin surges to $500,000 or $1 million, it may be more realistic to expect it to fall by about $200,000 a coin. According to Saylor, there are enough confirmations in the wider economy to support his all-or-nothing prediction for Bitcoin. “You have all the evidence you need to determine that,” the Strategy co-founder quipped. Saylor also pointed out that US President Trump’s backing of Bitcoin and his efforts to create a more friendly regulatory environment will buoy the asset’s uptrend. Meanwhile, traditional banks have started to leverage this improving regulatory scene to foray into the fast-growing market, as they prepare to provide BTC custody services. He further pointed out that demand for the scarce asset is going through the roof. For instance, BlackRock and other spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuers and nation states are buying up Bitcoin daily. Bilal Bin Saqib, head of Pakistan’s crypto council, recently disclosed that the country is set to create its own United States-esque strategic Bitcoin reserve. Saylor described the growing demand for Bitcoin as a “digital gold rush,” suggesting the top crypto has “gotten through its riskiest period; the accounting has been corrected.” It’s worth mentioning that Saylor is not the only uber-bullish pundit in the crypto market. As ZyCrypto previously reported, asset manager ARK Invest bumped its “bull case” Bitcoin price target from $1.5 million to $2.4 million by the end of 2030, bolstered mainly by institutional investors and Bitcoin’s growing acceptance as “digital gold.”

Dublin Stock image All suspended DART services between Lansdowne Road and Dalkey have resumed, though major delays and disruption are set to continue for commuters in Dublin this evening. An issue with the overhead lines between Booterstown and Blackrock suspended services between the two stations earlier this evening. Services were operating between Howth/Malahide to Lansdowne and from Greystones to Dalkey, with knock-on delays of more than 25 minutes due to congestion on the line. Stock image Today's news in 90 - 11th June 2025 Dublin Bus will honour all rail tickets during the outage and staff are currently on-site as they work to rectify the issue, a spokesperson for Irish Rail confirmed. More to follow... Dublin-based solicitor Carol McGuinness, a native of Stabannon, Co Louth, has been awarded Dublin Family Lawyer of the Year at the prestigious Irish Law Awards earlier this month.

Title: Remember when corporate America steered clear of politics on social media?

A series of random questions answered by Harvard experts. Elisabeth Kempf. Stephanie Mitchell/Harvard Staff Photographer Christina Pazzanese Harvard Staff Writer There was a time when corporate America was not very online. Most companies used social media for promoting products and services or engaging with consumers in a friendly fashion. Political posts on a company Twitter account were rare. That all changed between 2012 and 2022, when the volume of partisan speech on Twitter (now called X) from large corporations surged, more than doubling beginning in 2017, according to a new National Bureau of Economic Research working paper. Researchers said the spike was driven disproportionately by companies using language associated with Democratic politicians. The moves frequently had negative effects on company stock prices. In this edited conversation, the paper’s co-author Elisabeth Kempf, Jaime and Raquel Gilinski Associate Professor of Business Administration, explains corporate Twitter’s abrupt shift. It seems ubiquitous now, but corporations putting out partisan-sounding tweets is only a recent development. What did you find? Partisan speech was very rare for companies. Less than 1 percent of all the tweets they sent between 2012 and 2017 would constitute what was, according to our measures, very partisan speech. Wading into partisan, polarized issues can be tricky for companies. We saw the first big change in 2017 where both Democratic and Republican partisan speech picks up, and then this big asymmetry starting in 2019. That was the part that I found the most surprising. I was expecting to see some companies also start to use more Republican-sounding speech — to see, essentially, evidence of polarization. It was quite surprising to see that everybody seemed to adopt more Democratic speech after 2019 and that it was happening across the board, companies in blue states, red states, companies that are in consumer-facing businesses, also B2B [business to business]. “It was quite surprising to see that everybody seemed to adopt more Democratic speech after 2019 and that it was happening across the board, companies in blue states, red states.” How did you define partisan corporate speech? We built on previous work by Jesse Shapiro, my colleague at Harvard, and his co-authors. They developed this methodology to look at partisan speech in Congress that identifies phrases that allow you to correctly guess a speaker’s political party. We used their methodology and applied it to tweets sent by Democratic and Republican politicians. That allowed us to identify highly partisan phrases and then apply it to corporate speech. Essentially, phrases that sound like they could be coming from a Democratic or Republican politician is what we consider partisan speech. What did you learn about how partisan corporate speech has changed over time? The first fact is that partisan corporate speech has become more common over this time period, 2012 to 2022. The second fact is that this growth was really asymmetric. Starting in 2019, we see rapid growth in Democratic-sounding speech, while Republican-sounding speech stayed constant or, if anything, decreased toward the end. And third, when we look at stock returns around these partisan corporate statements, we see that they tend to be followed by negative abnormal stock returns. That said, we also see a lot of heterogeneity depending on the investor composition. For example, if there are more funds with ESG [environmental, social, and governance] objectives, then we see that the stock return after a Democratic-sounding statement tends to be less negative. Is it clear why these partisan Twitter statements suddenly escalated during this time? In 2017, we see both Democratic- and Republican-sounding speech go up for the first time. We don’t have so much to say on that. What we do have more to say on is when we start to see this divergence between Democratic- and Republican-sounding speech, which is in January 2019. That was when BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink put out a pretty influential letter, his “Dear CEOs” annual letter. He explicitly called on CEOs to be more vocal, take more stances on polarizing issues. This would be another potential piece of evidence to suggest that large institutional investors may have also played a role in this. BlackRock is the world’s largest asset manager so there was a lot of news reporting that this had kicked off a lot of discussion in the business world. Also in 2019, the Business Roundtable [a CEO lobbying association] came out saying shareholder value maximization should not be the sole purpose. So, I do think it was quite influential. We also see that 2019 was a massive growth in terms of the assets under management with a sustainability mandate. This is when a big shift happened in the investment industry. Recently, we’ve seen protest campaigns against Tesla and Bud Light spurred by perceived partisan corporate statements. Could robust consumer boycotts that threaten profits have contributed to declines in shares as opposed to just public or investor reaction to statements? This was the finding we struggled the most to make sense of. One possibility is, as you say, that maybe there could be facts of this partisan speech that affect what we would call the cash flows in finance or the profits that the companies make. For example, it might be losing employees or losing customers. We argue that partisan speech can affect a third potential stakeholder group — investors — and how much they are willing to hold the stock. We were looking at the 500 largest companies by market capitalization, so these are very big companies that need to raise capital from a pretty heterogeneous investor base. It’s hard for these large companies to raise capital only from Democrats or only from Republicans. And so, once you make a partisan statement that aligns with one group but not with the other, you might see precisely this negative stock price effect. It is also difficult to explain the growth in Democratic-sounding speech with consumer or employee preferences alone. To be clear: We wouldn’t want to conclude that investor or consumer preferences did not play a role at all. But we thought it was worth pointing out that it was hard to explain everything just with consumers or just with employees. Why is that? Because we see this rapid growth both for companies that are in consumer and non-consumer-facing industries. Boycotts could explain why maybe certain retail companies might adopt a certain speech, but we see it even in materials, which is a sector with companies that make metals, chemicals, coatings and things like this. It’s hard to think that there the consumer preferences for partisan speech would be super strong. I thought employees could be quite relevant, but we saw the same trend in companies with employees located in very Democratic areas versus Republican areas. We also didn’t see that labor market tightness played a role. You might imagine that if you’re really in desperate need of talent, maybe you would engage more in this partisan speech if you thought it would help in hiring. There were a couple of results that just made it hard to explain this with consumers or employees alone. Whereas, if you think about this investment channel, it could explain why we see it in companies that are based in blue areas, red areas. It could explain why this is such a broad-based phenomenon. Are there other aspects of corporate speech ripe for further research? Yes. I don’t think we have fully answered the question of why this big shift was happening then. We have suggestive evidence that investors could have played a role. But I don’t think there’s a full, causal relationship yet. So that is one big open question: How influential were investors versus consumers versus employees? The second question is what were the more long-term effects? We’re looking at stock prices over a relatively short window. What does this do in the longer run to companies, and potentially also to their relationship to politicians or how partisan speech by companies influences politics, I think, are exciting areas for future research.

Dart services between Lansdowne Road and Dún Laoghaire in Dublin have recommenced after a “major disruption” saw services suspended until 8pm. While services have resumed, ongoing delays and alterations are expected into Wednesday evening, Irish Rail said. Services were suspended at 2.40pm after overhead lines between Booterstown and Blackrock were damaged during vegetation maintenance works. Irish Rail said the damage had caused a “major disruption to Dart services” with significant delays to wider services as crews arrived on-site to rectify the issue. The fault caused knock-on delays to Dart and commuter services through the city centre due to congestion on the line with Dublin Bus services honouring rail tickets throughout the disruption. Services were solely operating between Howth/Malahide and Lansdowne Road as well as from Greystones to Dalkey until late on Wednesday evening while trains to Dundalk, Drogheda, Maynooth were also affected. Services to and from Rosslare departed and terminated at Bray due to the disruption with bus transfers being arranged. A spokesman for Irish Rail said the line between Lansdowne Road and Dún Laoghaire reopened shortly before 8pm after the overhead lines were repaired.

Title: Adani Group to raise ₹2.5 trillion over five years to fund capex

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Mumbai: Adani Group needs to raise about ₹2.5 trillion (about $30 billion) over the next five years to meet its $100-billion capital expenditure plan and meet its debt obligations, two top executives said, outlining the conglomerate’s growth strategy as it emerges from last year’s bribery allegations. The capital investments will be focussed on the energy and utilities and the infrastructure and logistics sectors, said Sagar Adani, executive director of Adani Green Energy Ltd and nephew of Adani Group chair Gautam Adani. Sagar Adani spoke with Mint on Wednesday in his first media interview since US authorities in November charged him along with Gautam Adani and group executive Vneet Jaain with securities fraud. He did not comment on the subject. Gautam Adani said in his recent annual address to shareholders of flagship company Adani Enterprises Ltd that the group would invest $15-20 billion ( ₹1.3-1.7 trillion) annually over the next five years. That investment figure was the base case, said Jugeshinder Singh, Adani Group’s chief financial officer, adding that under ideal circumstances the investments could be higher. Adani Group invested ₹1.26 trillion in FY25 and is looking to increase its capital expenditure this financial year, Singh said, adding that the group accounts for a fifth of the private capex in India. While the bulk of the group’s capex needs will be met through the cash it generates, the conglomerate will need additional fund infusion, including to service its debt, Singh said. The Adani Group has about ₹1.6 trillion in debt maturities between 2025-26 and 2029-30, as per an investor presentation. “We will borrow to refinance the debt that we need to pay back. (Including refinancing and capex) we’ll need roughly ₹2.5 lakh crore ( ₹2.5 trillion) in new borrowings over the next five years," the CFO said.

We only do two things as a group—one is energy and utilities and the second is transport and logistics," he said. “All the other things we do are around these two fundamental pillars." For instance, in the cement sector, three-fourths of the cost are energy, raw materials, and logistics, Adani explained. Adani Group, which has become the second-largest cement maker in India by a wide margin through a string of acquisitions starting 2022, is betting on group synergies to source cheap electricity and coal and on low transportation costs to beat peers in terms of margins, Adani said. “No one can supply electricity at scale and cost better than us, and no one can handle and operate logistics in a more streamlined way that we can," he said. The group also plans to invest in copper, aluminium and other metals in the coming years. Adani Group operationalized a copper smelter with capacity for 0.5 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) in Mundra earlier this year, which it plans to ramp up to 1 MTPA. The copper relies on ore imported from Chile. For aluminium, the group plans to bid for bauxite ore mines through government auctions. Once raw material supply is secured, it will invest in aluminium. Both the metals consume significant energy for production, giving Adani Group an edge by sourcing cheap power, he said.

Presently, this business is housed under the group’s flagship company Adani Enterprises, which is also the group’s incubator for new businesses. The airports business, which operates eight airports including Mumbai and Ahmedabad, will be ready for demerger from Adani Enterprises by FY28, said Singh, Adani Group’s chief financial officer. Meanwhile, the group’s multiple listed cement companies, including Ambuja Cements Ltd, ACC Ltd, Sanghi Industries Ltd, and Orient Cement Ltd, as well as unlisted Penna Cement Industries Ltd, will eventually be merged, but only after the operations are streamlined, he added. “The bigger objective is to first operationally stabilize everything. Currently we are not 100% there," Singh said, adding that streamlining brands, supply chains, and distribution across the group’s cement companies would take about 18 months. Sagar Adani added that although Adani Group focusses on energy and infrastructure, it does not face any risk of concentration of assets. “No single asset contributes more than 9% of our Ebitda." Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, is a key measure of operational efficiency. Adani Group’s emphasis on its growth strategy comes after Gautam Adani, as per media reports, began talks with US President Donald Trump’s administration earlier this year to seek dismissal of the criminal charges against him in the bribery probe. The Adani Group had been previously battling allegations raised by short-seller Hindenburg Research in January 2023. The US Department of Justice (DOJ) and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had in November alleged that the Adanis paid or promised over $250 million in bribes to Indian officials to secure favourable solar energy contracts for Adani Green Energy, the company headed by Sagar Adani. Earlier this month, the Wall Street Journal reported that the DOJ was investigating whether Adani’s companies violated US sanctions on Iran. Adani Group has denied all the allegations.

Title: The Bond Market Is Cracking, And This 9% Dividend Is Ready For It

ByBrett Owens ByBrett Owens, Contributor. Coupons, rates, yields and other informations are displayed. Interest rates concept. 3D ... More illustration BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is turning its back on long-term Treasuries—and that’s rattling the bond market. That, in turn, has the mainstream crowd turning its back on ALL bonds. Mainstream crowd turning its back? That’s all we need to hear! In a second, I’ll reveal a 9% “contrarians only” dividend that’s tailor-made for this critical time in Bond-land. First, let’s break down what the global investment titan is telling us here: In its weekly commentary, released June 2, BlackRock laid things out in stark terms (or at least as stark as a stuffy financial institution gets!): “Our strongest conviction [bolding mine] has been staying underweight long-term US Treasuries.” Then the real kick in the teeth: “We prefer the euro area to the US.” Ouch. BlackRock’s not alone in turning up its nose at long-term government bonds. DoubleLine Capital, led by “Bond God” Jeffrey Gundlach, is turning away, too—especially when it comes to the longest of the long bonds: “Where we can outright short [30-year Treasuries], we are,” one of the firm’s portfolio managers recently said. We’re talking about 30-year Treasuries here. Invest for three decades and get your cash back at maturity, with a steady payout kicked your way every year. Till now, these have been seen as among the safest of the safe investments. Yet as I write this, investors are demanding a near-5% yield to take on the “risk” of owning them! All of this—not to mention weak demand at a recent 20-year government bond auction—has investors fretting over bonds, corporate and government alike. We, meantime, are targeting select corporate bond closed-end funds (CEFs) like the one we’ll name below, quietly kicking out yields of 9%, 10% and more. Let’s get into why, starting with Uncle Sam. It’s not hard to see why investors aren’t keen to boost his credit line. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO)—famous for its rose-colored glasses—has already projected a $1.9-trillion deficit for 2025. This leaves the government with a $40-trillion debt hole, deepening by $2 trillion a year. Congress is also working through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which the CBO estimates will add $2.4 trillion to deficits over the next decade. And, of course, Moody’s recently lowered America’s credit rating. With buyers of government debt thin on the ground, long-term government bond yields are rising (and prices are falling, as yields and prices move in opposite directions). That’s a giant red flag for all bonds, right? While this interpretation isn’t exactly wrong, it focuses too much on the numbers and not enough on the human factor, specifically Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Fed Chair Jay Powell—or more specifically, Powell’s likely successor. Let’s start with Bessent, who has straight-out said he wants to lower the 10-year Treasury rate—pacesetter for consumer and business loans. He’s got plenty of tools at his disposal, including leaning more heavily on short-term debt to fund the government. That limits the supply of “long” bonds, offsetting future lame auction demand and driving up bond prices (while reducing their yields). This is something Bessent criticized former Treasury Secretary Yellen for doing. But he’s been quietly keeping it up. Finally, we’ve got an administration fixated on tariffs (which slow growth) and lowering energy prices. It won’t take much extra drilling to pull off the latter—WTI crude is already on the mat, at $63 a barrel as of this writing, on rising OPEC production. Slower growth + lower oil = lower inflation (and lower rates). Then there’s Jay Powell, who, yes, has been holding off on rate cuts. (Jay controls the “short” end of the yield curve, the rate banks charge each other for short-term loans.) But Jay’s term ends in 11 months, and it’s highly likely the administration will appoint a successor who would work with the government to reduce rates. Lower “short” rates would act as a weight on long rates, helping push bond prices higher. All of this is a prime setup for high-yield corporate debt, which is being shunned along with the federal government’s credit. A top play comes from the Bond God himself: the DoubleLine Yield Opportunities Fund (DLY). As I write this, DLY yields 9%, and its real strength is its wide mandate—Gundlach is free to invest in any form of high-yield credit, anywhere in the world. That’s what we want: This bond savant unchained and working for us! He’s taking a smart approach, too, keeping most of DLY’s portfolio (just under 70%) in high-yield corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities (which despite the fact that they touched off the 2008 financial crisis are highly regulated today), emerging-market debt and a range of other debt instruments with durations of three years or less. That’s a prudent setup, as shorter-term bonds still kick out strong yields and won’t be hit as hard as longer-term bonds if rates stay stuck at these levels for a while, or even rise. It also frees up Gundlach to reinvest faster as the rate picture shifts. Beyond that, since Gundlach can invest across the globe, DLY can benefit as more capital, spooked by Uncle Sam’s bloated budget, hunts for yield abroad. As I write, DLY trades at a 0.6% discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its portfolio) down from a roughly 1.5% premium earlier this spring. The fund also pays that 9% annual dividend with monthly distributions. It has paid special dividends in the past, too. DLY Dividend The bottom line? With Bessent working to bring down rates now, and more help likely from the Fed down the road, we’ve got a flexible setup for income and upside, guided by Gundlach himself. Let’s buy before this discount grows into a healthy premium. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: The Art Of Effective Board Leadership: How To Truly Add Value

ByMarie Holive ByMarie Holive, Forbes Councils Member. Marie Holive is the COO of Proteus International and 3-time board member of public and private companies in the U.S., U.K. and Canada. When I first entered the boardroom as an independent director, the weight of expectation was palpable. It’s a space where strategic oversight, ethical stewardship and a drive for excellence converge. In my experience, effective leadership isn’t about being the smartest person in the room. It’s about being the most effective: listening intently, asking the right questions and knowing when to support or challenge. The most valuable contributions often happen outside formal meetings: over coffee, in late‑night emails and during quiet reflection. They are built on genuine relationships, relentless curiosity and rigorous preparation. The journey to becoming an impactful, independent director is ongoing and multifaceted. It demands vigilance, humility and constant adaptation. Based on my experience across multiple boards, here are six disciplines that can help you have the greatest impact as a board director. The boardroom is an arena where diverse perspectives, competing priorities and high stakes intersect. Influence typically comes less from having all the answers and more from nurturing a space where the best answers surface. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, reminds us that “boards meet only periodically, but their responsibility is continuous.” A strong board director should be able to cut through complexity and safeguard the company’s best interests, speaking up when necessary and listening when wisdom lies elsewhere. Powerful moments can spring from a well‑timed question that reveals hidden risk, creating clarity from ambiguity. And remember: Having diverse voices across age, gender, geography and discipline in your board can sharpen oversight and reduce blind spots. Behind the scenes, it's important for directors to devote significant time to preparation. The National Association of Corporate Directors (NACD) reports that "annual independent director time commitment has increased from less than 250 hours to more than 300 hours over the last decade." The learning agendas for many directors include things like site visits, scenario drills, outside courses and formal briefings during meetings—time deliberately reserved to expand the board’s collective expertise. Stay attuned to industry shifts, geopolitical currents and emerging risks. For example, I've found that understanding climate disclosures, generative AI and political volatility can reshape strategy. Read voraciously, ask questions relentlessly and admit what you don’t know. Schedule quarterly deep dives, invite external experts, attend director‑education programs and benchmark against peers to stay ahead. When you treat learning as a lifelong mandate, you can help your board pivot faster and with greater confidence. Facilitation is a mindset. Create dialogue, not monologues. In practice, that means ensuring every voice is heard, listening deeply and interjecting with questions that refocus discussion. For example, as Audit and Risk Committee Chair, I am responsible for fostering an environment where divergent views can thrive, and the most effective way I have found for doing this is asking probing questions that challenge assumptions while maintaining respect and collaboration. Mary Barra, CEO of General Motors, notes, “I learned the importance of listening and really understanding people—and listening to understand, as opposed to just thinking you have all the answers because you looked at some data.” Yet listening alone isn’t enough; the craft lies in discerning when you should intervene and framing questions to draw out perspectives that might otherwise remain unspoken. Timing is an art that involves balancing assertiveness and restraint. Silence can be as powerful as speech. Offering space can spark breakthroughs, while stepping in decisively can avert costly mistakes. I recommend using this simple practice: Pause before responding—count to five and ask yourself whether your input will add clarity or merely reiterate. Tune into the body language and energy shifts of the other person or people involved—these can signal when emphasis or breathing room is needed. In my experience, the ability to know when to speak and when to listen separates good directors from great ones and demands constant refinement, emotional intelligence and self‑awareness. Governance doesn’t begin and end in the boardroom; it extends to subcommittees, where critical topics receive deep scrutiny. Chairing Audit and Risk for three companies (two publicly listed and one private) has given me an appreciation for this engine‑room work. The role of subcommittee member goes beyond reviewing financial statements; it requires meticulous oversight of reporting, a sharp eye on risk, and transparent communication with auditors and management. Committees shoulder tremendous responsibility amid complex regulations, evolving cyber threats and heightened stakeholder expectations for transparency. The key to effective leadership here is to ensure that this risk oversight by your committees and subcommitties stays proactive rather than reactive—anticipating threats, stress‑testing controls, and creating frameworks that allow both agility and resilience. Behind every meeting lies the essential work of cultivating authentic relationships with stakeholders. Engaging with executives, employees and fellow directors outside formal settings can offer vital insight into your organization’s heartbeat. I've found that these interactions can deepen understanding and build trust, but they also demand self‑awareness. Reflect on how you show up and how your presence impacts others, especially in high‑stakes settings. Relationships rooted in trust, empathy and mutual respect are important for good governance. Understanding the people behind the data is as crucial as understanding the metrics, and in my experience, that begins with understanding ourselves. Ultimately, board service transcends strategy and finance. It’s about embodying integrity, demonstrating unwavering commitment and fostering an environment where diverse perspectives are valued. It’s about being present—not just in meetings but in the fabric of the organization’s journey. Whether you’re pursuing or practicing directorship, I encourage you to embrace the multifaceted nature of the role, remain steadfast in your pursuit of knowledge and never underestimate the power of genuine relationships. That’s where lasting impact begins. Forbes Business Council is the foremost growth and networking organization for business owners and leaders. Do I qualify?

Title: Bitcoin To $1 Million? Michael Saylor Laughs Off Crypto Winter Fears

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Bitcoin’s price outlook remains sky-high after Strategy founder Michael Saylor told Bloomberg on Tuesday that a market freeze won’t come back. He argued that growing demand and limited daily supply point straight to a rally toward $1 million. According to Saylor, miners release only about 450 BTC each day. That adds up to roughly $50 million at today’s price of around $109,859. Many are trying to figure out which will be the next 1000x crypto. He said once that $50 million is snapped up by buyers, there’s no choice but for the price to climb. His view rests on the idea that active demand now matches or exceeds what miners sell. Based on reports, asset manager ARK Invest recently boosted its bull case for Bitcoin from $1.5 million to $2.4 million by the end of 2030. Saylor went even further. He said that as long as Bitcoin doesn’t head to zero, it’s bound for $1 million. His own firm has picked up 582,000 BTC since 2020. That stash is worth nearly $64 billion, according to Saylor Tracker data. Saylor pointed to big names backing Bitcoin. He mentioned US President Donald Trump, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and SEC chair Paul Atkins as signs that the asset has won its toughest battles. He also noted that banks are lining up to offer custody services. And he praised Bitcoin ETFs from BlackRock and others for buying coins daily. Saylor didn’t shy away from a cautionary note. He suggested that if Bitcoin hits $500,000 or $1 million, a fall to about $200,000 could follow. That’s almost a 60% drop from the peak. His point was that big price swings are part of Bitcoin’s history—and likely its future. Beyond miner sales and whale wallets, analysts say wider market moves matter too. Spot and futures trading often top $10 billion a day, so $50 million of fresh buys might only nudge the price. Regulation could swing the other way if concerns over energy use or consumer protection grow. And rival cryptocurrencies keep popping up with new features. Reports disclose the real test will be whether steady new buyers can outpace both miner supply and selling by holders looking to bank profits. Saylor’s figures make a strong case for continued upside. But investors who build a plan around a $1 million Bitcoin should brace for big dips along the way. In the end, daily demand, political moves and how the rest of the financial world reacts will decide if those eye-popping targets really come to pass. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from TradingView They say journalists never truly clock out. But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle.

When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. They say journalists never truly clock out. But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Ripple targets the burgeoning $19 trillion tokenized asset market through innovative XRPL initiatives and strategic alliances. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Ripple has brought Ondo Finance’s tokenized US Treasuries product, Ondo Short-Term US Government Treasuries (OUSG), to the XRP Ledger. The launch was announced on June 11 and is seen as a move to expand the reach of institutional-grade tokenized assets across the fast-rising blockchain network. According to the statement, the integration allows institutional investors to mint and redeem OUSG on XRPL using RLUSD, Ripple’s new stablecoin. This offers an alternative to traditional finance rails by enabling seamless access to tokenized Treasury exposure around the clock. At the same time, Ripple and Ondo have also committed liquidity to ensure the product launches with strong trading activity on XRPL. RLUSD will act as a key enabler for cross-network utility and settlement. OUSG provides permissioned on-chain access to short-term US Treasury yields. According to RWA. XYZ data, the platform currently ranks among the largest tokenized Treasury products worldwide, with a reported market value of approximately $692 million. Following the announcement, Ondo’s native ONDO token recorded a 4% price gain, trading near $0.90 at press time, according to data from CryptoSlate. OUSG’s XRPL launch aligns with Ripple’s broader efforts to position the network as a competitive platform for tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). Over the past year, Ripple has pursued multiple partnerships, including one with Guggenheim Partners, to advance tokenization initiatives on XRPL. The firm’s strategy is driven by forecasts that the tokenized asset market could reach $19 trillion by 2033. This is already evident in the rapid traction of tokenized treasury and money market products as asset managers like BlackRock explore new ways to modernize fund distribution and settlement processes. As a result, the market is gaining broad adoption across the board. Markus Infanger, Senior Vice President at RippleX, said: “Institutions can now access high-quality assets like US treasuries on public blockchains, with the compliance and efficiency they need. This represents progress in bringing trusted financial assets into a 24/7 market—enabling greater liquidity, operational efficiency, and faster access to capital.” Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential. He imparts insights on a range of topics like DeFi, hacks, mining and culture, underlining transformative power.

June 11, 2025 07:19 ET | Source: EBC Financial Group EBC Financial Group LONDON, June 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- EBC Financial Group (EBC) has announced the launch of over 100 new U.S.-listed Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) CFDs, expanding its multi-asset product suite and offering global client's deeper access to diversified, thematic trading opportunities. The rollout highlights EBC’s ongoing commitment to delivering institutional-grade tools across asset classes, underpinned by flexibility, transparency, and efficiency. The new offering includes ETFs listed on the NYSE and NASDAQ, issued by leading asset managers such as Vanguard, iShares (BlackRock), and State Street Global Advisors. Thematic coverage spans a wide range of global macro and sectoral narratives. “This expansion reflects our vision to bridge intelligent product design with market relevance,” said David Barrett, CEO of EBC Financial Group (UK) Ltd. “The new products are a natural evolution for traders seeking targeted exposure with greater strategic flexibility. At EBC, we’re building an ecosystem that empowers both precision and performance.” Thematic Access Meets Tactical Flexibility The additional ETF-linked instruments cover a variety of market exposures, including geographic allocations like the iShares MSCI Brazil ETF; fixed income-focused strategies such as the iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond Fund; and sector- or commodity-based indices including the United States Oil Fund LP and the Vanguard Health Care ETF. Other themes include dividend-related baskets, mid-cap equities, and style-based index tracking. These developments reflect wider industry interest in instruments that mirror trends in asset allocation without direct ownership of the underlying securities. Across many markets, sector-tilted and style-based index products are gaining relevance as participants seek flexible ways to align with global narratives. Historically, ETFs tracking specific economic cycles—such as commodity recoveries or emerging market rebounds—have demonstrated performance differentiation. The iShares MSCI Brazil ETF, for example, notably outperformed the S&P 500 during the post-pandemic recovery period in 2021, highlighting how thematic instruments can diverge from broad indices depending on market cycles. These additions serve as both stand-alone trade ideas and complementary instruments alongside EBC’s existing product lineup, enabling advanced portfolio structuring and thematic trading. Smarter Exposure: Leverage, Shorting, and Cost Efficiency in One Product Compared to direct ETF investments, it presents several key advantages as traders benefit from a simplified cost structure, with no traditional fund management fees or broker commissions. The flexibility to take both long and short positions allows for strategic trading regardless of market direction, while the use of leverage enhances capital efficiency and return potential. These trades are executed in real time via EBC’s recognised platforms, providing seamless access to market opportunities. During key market cycles, for example the post-pandemic V-shaped recovery of 2021—certain thematic ETFs, like the iShares MSCI Brazil ETF, significantly outperformed broader indices such as the S&P 500. Our portfolio enables traders to participate in similar trends, adapting quickly to shifting market dynamics with precision and speed.

Title: Singapore-backed realty company bets on India entertainment boom

Prestige Estates Projects Ltd., which ranks among India’s top five real estate developers by market value, is looking to sell more entertainment and dining spaces in malls while cutting back on apparel retailers, a top official said. “Shopping can be done from anywhere once you know the brand, entertainment cannot be bought online,” Muhammed Ali, chief executive officer-retail of the Singapore government-backed firm said over phone. The developer, which counts Blackrock Inc. and Vanguard Inc. as its investors, plans to allocate 40% space in malls to entertainment and restaurants, twice of what its older properties offer. At the same time, retail space will be cut from as much as 85% to 60%, Ali added. His strategy mirrors the rapid transformation in India’s consumer landscape driven by a combination of rising income levels, aspirations and demographics. It also comes as e-commerce is challenging traditional retail, and malls are trying to reposition themselves as experience-driven destinations with shopping, leisure and lifestyle thrown in the mix. India’s top cinema chain PVR Inox Ltd. is betting on a slew of big-ticket Bollywood and Hollywood releases to bring back audiences while consultancy firm Mordor Intelligence notes that quick service restaurants are seeing a steady rise in average order value and increasingly establishing themselves in retail spaces to capture a broader customer base. Prestige plans to grow its presence to 15 malls spanning 10 million square feet in cities such as Bangalore, Mumbai, Hyderabad, and Goa by 2030. It operates four malls at present. Prestige is expanding the scope of entertainment to include physical activities that engage people of all ages and help them “burn a few hundred calories.” Prestige shares have fallen 11% over the last year, nearly twice the decline in the NSE Realty index. The company’s profit for the year ended March 31 was down 62% on year to 6.16 billion rupees ($72.1 million), the lowest in five years. Analysts at JM Financial said in a note on Monday that they expect growth in residential sales to moderate after surging in the last two to three years. That makes it imperative for Prestige and other developers to diversify their revenue stream. “These are the things that online cannot compete with us, where senses are involved, where you need to physically be there,” said Ali, referring to entertainment and dining. The company is also focused on live performances. The new mall structure is expected to generate around 12.50 billion rupees in rentals annually by 2030, Ali said. That is a sixfold jump from a little over two billion rupees the company made in rentals in the financial year through March 2025. “We are challenging the status quo. These malls are going to be very exciting platforms,” said Ali. More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com ©2025 Bloomberg L.P.
