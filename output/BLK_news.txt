More NGAN/AFP via Getty Images) Bitcoin’s price reached a historic high early Monday morning, July 14, capping off a weekend rally fueled by record ETF inflows, investor optimism, and growing institutional interest. The milestone coincides with “Crypto Week” in Washington, D.C., where lawmakers are split between advancing pro-crypto legislation and spotlighting “blatant corruption,” as Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters put it, tied to the Trump administration’s digital asset involvement. The data aggregation site CoinMarketCap indicated that bitcoin’s price rally peaked at $123,091.61 early morning on July 14, 2025, setting a new all-time high. Bitcoin’s price has now gained more than 30% since January, rebounding from an April low of just above $75,000. Institutional inflows into bitcoin exchange-traded funds have bolstered the surge and the anticipation of pro-crypto legislation in Congress. ETH, Sol, XRP, among other top cryptocurrencies, also posted gains so far this year. The total crypto market capitalization now stands at approximately $3.8 trillion. On Thursday alone, bitcoin ETFs saw $1.18 billion in net inflows — the largest single-day total of 2025. Funds such as BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust and Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin ETF have played a key role in driving mainstream access to the asset. In a post on X, Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, noted that because of “recent flows and the overnight rally, [the fund] Bitcoin policy momentum includes the Generational Economic National Innovation for U.S. Strategy, known as the GENIUS Act, a bipartisan bill that introduces the first federal framework for regulating stablecoins. The GENIUS Act cleared the Senate Banking Committee last month and is expected to continue making progress this week in the House of Representatives. The GENIUS Act defines payment stablecoins as digital assets that must be redeemable at a fixed value, like one U.S. dollar. Issuers are required to back each stablecoin with an equal amount of approved reserve assets, such as Treasury bills, insured bank deposits, or central bank reserves. These reserves can only be used for redemptions or specific collateralized transactions. Issuers must follow rules on capital, liquidity, and risk management but are exempt from traditional bank capital requirements. They must also provide clear redemption policies, disclose reserve holdings, and undergo third-party audits. Those with over $50 billion in circulation must submit annual audited financial statements. The bill also bans interest payments on stablecoins and imposes strict anti-money-laundering and sanctions compliance, with restrictions on executives with financial crime convictions. Banks, credit unions, or qualified nonbanks can issue stablecoins. Issuers with over $10 billion must operate under federal oversight, while smaller nonbanks may opt for a state-based regime if it aligns with federal standards. The bill outlines rules for foreign stablecoins and allows their use if regulatory standards are met. Custodians must keep customer funds separate from their own, and banks can use blockchain to manage stablecoin services. In the event of bankruptcy, stablecoin holders are prioritized for repayment. The bill clarifies that payment stablecoins are not securities or commodities and prohibits misleading marketing or bundling. Senior federal officials must disclose stablecoin holdings above $5,000. Bitcoin’s rally arrives during what has been dubbed “Crypto Week” in Washington, a series of policy hearings, roundtables, and advocacy events across Capitol Hill focused on the digital asset economy. “We are taking historic steps to ensure the United States remains the world’s leader in innovation, and I look forward to ‘Crypto Week’ in the House,” said Rep. French Hill, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, in a public statement. Among the events scheduled are a House Ways and Means hearing on crypto tax policy, a Dodd-Frank retrospective touching on decentralized finance, and ongoing closed-door meetings between Senate staff and industry stakeholders. At the same time, Democrats on the House Financial Services Committee have launched a coordinated effort labeled “Anti-Crypto Corruption Week,” aimed at countering what they describe as “regulatory capture” by the Trump administration and ethical lapses related to digital assets. Waters is leading the Democratic campaign, which includes public statements, investigative memos and proposed legislation. President Donald Trump’s memecoin initiatives are a main focus of these criticisms from Democrats. The collectible $TRUMP coin, launched in early 2025, has been promoted by individuals associated with the Trump campaign and has drawn scrutiny over its financial and political implications. Trump has aggressively embraced bitcoin and other digital assets during his second term. In March, he issued an executive order creating a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve” also stating that he is “very positive and open-minded to cryptocurrency companies, and all things related to this new and burgeoning industry. Our country must be the leader in the field.” The Trump administration’s recent actions, including the removal of key Securities and Exchange Commission staff focused on digital asset enforcement, have raised questions about whether regulatory safeguards are being scaled back. At the same time, the administration’s pro-crypto stance has been viewed by some in the industry as a potential catalyst for U.S. leadership in digital innovation. Still, the alignment presents a cultural tension. While the Bitcoin ecosystem promotes decentralization and resistance to centralized control, the political branding surrounding Trump often emphasizes hierarchy, loyalty, and singular leadership. Despite growing controversy, bitcoin’s climb to $123,000 marks one of the fastest in its 16-year history. After reaching $100,000 in December and $110,000 by late May, the price of bitcoin grew another $13,000 in just 53 days. The rally follows a volatile first half of 2025, including a sharp April dip driven by regulatory uncertainty and rising Treasury yields. Renewed ETF inflows and clearer policy signals have since reignited momentum. This new high is more than a market milestone. It highlights the expanding role that bitcoin plays in the financial system, even with the intensified debates over how digital assets should be regulated. The rally has reinforced the view that bitcoin is moving closer to mainstream financial use cases. Whether the GENIUS Act can provide lasting structure, or whether political infighting and memecoin speculation undercut trust, may become clearer in the weeks ahead. Bitcoin’s record-setting price arrives at a pivotal moment for United States crypto policy. As lawmakers debate comprehensive regulation and examine political connections to the industry, the market appears to be pricing in long-term legitimacy. What happens next in Washington could shape the future of bitcoin and the broader digital asset economy.

Title: BlackRock’s IBIT becomes top 20 ETF in US, poised to exceed $100 billion in assets this month

Market analysts noted that BTC rally is pushing the BlackRock's ETF towards unprecedented $100 billion asset mark. BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) is on track to surpass $100 billion in assets this month, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. In a June 14 post on X, Balchunas noted that while he previously projected the fund, IBIT, could hit the $100 billion mark this summer, it could happen even sooner. He highlighted that the ETF has already reached $88 billion in assets thanks to recent inflows and BTC’s overnight rally above $120,000. He pointed out that the current AuM places the fund as the 20th largest ETF in the US and the 7th largest for BlackRock. Remarkably, it is also the asset manager’s most profitable ETF, even though it is just 1.5 years old. Observers pointed out that the recent price surge in Bitcoin would further spark renewed momentum and drive institutional capital into the fund. Bitcoin analyst Kiwi said: “This week could mark a massive shift in allocation to BTC/IBIT should this pump continue – the money on the sidelines isn’t retail – it’s smart money. Hw long can they sit by and watch this train roll past without action? The career risk to not owning a substantial amount of Bitcoin is getting larger by the hour.” Data from SoSo Value shows $IBIT’s cumulative net inflows reached $54.40 billion as of July 11. The ETF now holds more than 705,000 BTC, which is roughly 3.6% of Bitcoin’s total circulating supply. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: This is what fiat death looks like. Bitcoin’s 1,500% boom paves the path to Hyperbitcoinization

Hyperbitcoinization looms as Bitcoin climbs financial ranks with sovereign and corporate backing. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Bitcoin has outpaced traditional benchmarks since 2020, registering gains exceeding 1,500%, while gold advanced roughly 115% and the U.S. Dollar Index remained nearly flat. The divergence in asset performance reflects a period of monetary expansion, persistent inflation concerns, and evolving perceptions of scarce, non-sovereign assets as institutional investors and sovereign entities re-evaluate reserves and portfolio allocations. Bitcoin climbed from price levels near $7,700 in early 2020 to intraday highs around $123,164 today, driven partly by a weak dollar and spot exchange-traded funds in the United States that removed barriers to institutional participation. As BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust exceeded 700,000 BTC in holdings and surpassed $88 billion in assets under management, the asset class has been increasingly woven into regulated investment products. Institutional access is regarded as creating a price floor while mitigating the volatility traditionally associated with digital assets. Gold’s upward trajectory continued through the same period, rising from around $1,550 per ounce to over $3,300, as geopolitical tensions and inflation protection strategies preserved demand for physical assets. Meanwhile, the dollar’s relative value against other currencies remains flat after substantial volatility, and its purchasing power has eroded by an estimated 20% cumulatively from 2020 to 2025 due to inflation. The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent economic policy responses in 2020 fueled an expansion of monetary supply and fiscal interventions unprecedented in modern history, prompting market participants to seek stores of value beyond fiat. Bitcoin’s fixed supply and decentralized nature positioned it as both a speculative vehicle and a potential hedge, capturing capital from investors diversifying away from sovereign currency exposure. Bitcoin’s acceleration has led many to explore the thesis of Hyperbitcoinization, where it might replace fiat currencies as a primary medium of exchange and store of value. While the prevailing analyses maintain this scenario remains improbable in the near term, today’s environment mirrors how fiat currencies’ fall would start. Bitcoin has become a macro asset comparable to gold rather than an imminent replacement for the dollar. Regulatory frameworks, taxation requirements mandating fiat settlement, and the economic risk of deflation inherent in fixed-supply monetary systems remain substantial hurdles to Bitcoin fully supplanting traditional currencies. Institutions and governments have nonetheless integrated Bitcoin into treasury strategies. As CryptoSlate has reported, the Emirate of Abu Dhabi disclosed a $439 million position in Bitcoin ETFs. In the United States, President Trump signed an executive order initiating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, signaling official sector interest in holding Bitcoin alongside traditional reserves. Further complicating the outlook, U.S. trade policy in 2025 has introduced tariffs on major trading partners, contributing to inflationary pressures and leading to a decline of around 10% in the dollar index year-to-date. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink cautioned in public statements that persistent fiscal deficits and the risk of dollar debasement could elevate digital assets like Bitcoin as alternatives, reflecting sentiment from parts of the financial establishment that Bitcoin’s role is shifting from speculative asset to strategic reserve. Currently, the total US debt stands at $37 trillion and rising, while the dollar is in a precarious position. However, surging institutional adoption has coincided with declining evidence of grassroots activity. While on-chain throughput broke above 500,000 transfers a day several times in 2025, Lightning Network capacity has remained relatively flat around 5,000 BTC since mid-2022. Further, the past few months have seen a slight drop in capacity to around 4,300 BTC, according to mempool.space. Though the Lightning Network is not the only way to move Bitcoin on-chain cheaply, numerous layer-1s host forms of wrapped Bitcoin, which are used regularly across multiple chains. Transfers below $1,000 do make up more than half of the total on-chain Bitcoin volume, pointing to peer-to-peer settlement rather than exchange consolidation. Those metrics, paired with ETF inflows, corporate treasury adoption, Abu Dhabi’s allocation, and the U.S. strategic reserve order, create a picture that matches the early stage of Hyperbitcoinization: fiat dilution, a stronger Bitcoin price, and the first migration of day-to-day transactions onto a rival monetary rail. If throughput on Lightning and other layers widens further, the framework for mass transactional adoption will be in place, and Bitcoin’s role will move from balance-sheet hedge to usable money. That transition is underway, but the focus remains on acquiring Bitcoin rather than integrating Bitcoin as a technological tool to revolutionize TradFi. Still, maybe that’s not what we need right now. If the corporate world relies on Bitcoin for its store of value, placing that value in Lightning Channels to earn yield or staking it to secure other blockchains becomes an enticing offer. From there, using Bitcoin to secure critical infrastructure and building tech stacks around Bitcoin’s immutable global timestamping service is a logical next step. At that point, Bitcoin becomes not only the best store of value but the catalyst to secure and integrate that value into the entire digital world.

Ben Weiss is a crypto reporter at Fortune. The world’s largest cryptocurrency is on a tear. Bitcoin rocketed past $120,000 for the first time in history to notch a new all-time high of nearly $123,000 early Monday morning, according to data from Binance. The cryptocurrency posted a daily jump of about 3% and a weekly gain of more than 12%. Bitcoin’s Monday surge follows a string of recent highs. After hovering under $110,000 for more than a month, it notched new records on Thursday and through the weekend amid a corresponding rally in the stock market. Bitcoin’s jump in price also comes amid a glut of demand from institutional investors, who are more likely to invest in crypto through digital asset products offered by established Wall Street firms. Crypto ETFs from the asset management giant BlackRock saw an influx of more than $2.4 billion over the past week, according to data from the crypto investment firm CoinShares. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, rose nearly 3% over the past day to shoot past $3,000. It’s up 20% in the past week. Despite the gains from the two largest cryptocurrencies, the total market capitalization of all digital assets was down 0.5% day-over-day to about $3.87 trillion. In total, crypto ETFs recorded an inflow of $3.7 billion last week, the second-largest week on record, according to CoinShares. James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, attributed the booming demand for Bitcoin to “political developments and signals from the Federal Reserve.” On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve released minutes for its June meeting. Officials largely agreed that there would be cuts in interest rates sometime this year. “Most participants assessed that some reduction in the target range for the federal funds rate this year would likely be appropriate,” read the summary of the meeting. Meanwhile, positive political developments for crypto in Congress buoyed investor enthusiasm, said Butterfill. The House is set to vote this week on the GENIUS Act, a bill that would regulate stablecoins, which the Senate passed in June. It is also set to vote on the CLARITY Act, legislation that would specify how U.S. financial agencies should regulate digital assets writ large. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Ethereum to hit $1.5 million? Top investor predicts mind-blowing 100x surge with new ETFs

Ethereum price prediction is making headlines after EMJ Capital's Eric Jackson forecasted that ETH could reach $1.5 million per token over time. With Ethereum staking ETF approval likely before October, Jackson believes the real price rally hasn't even started. He points to Ethereum's growing use by major companies like Coinbase and Shopify, deflationary token supply, and increasing demand from traditional finance. Jackson says this shift could make Ethereum a “100-bagger” asset. With ETH currently trading around $3,040, his base case targets $10K by 2026. If adoption and staking take off, ETH’s long-term value could surprise everyone.

Title: BSGM Engages CXG to Acquire FINRA/SEC-Registered Broker-Dealer to Expand Publicly Traded RWA Tokenization Operations

Full Content:
July 14, 2025 – Los Angeles, United States BioSig Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: BSGM) (‘BioSig’), which recently merged with Streamex Exchange Corporation (‘Streamex’) (together, ‘BSGM’ or the ‘Company’), is excited to announce a critical step toward becoming one of the first fully regulated RWA tokenization companies trading on a major US exchange. Streamex has engaged Compliance Exchange Group (CXG) to lead and manage the acquisition of a specific FINRA and SEC-registered broker-dealer with licensed operations. Management notes that the near-term vision is to provide access to fully compliant, gold-backed tokenized assets for US institutional and retail investors targeting the $22 trillion global gold market within the $142 trillion commodities sector, while engaging network-effect-based accelerating growth for the Streamex proprietary on-chain RWA-backed commodity exchange and financing ecosystem. Near term, the acquisition positions Streamex to bridge TradFi (traditional finance) and blockchain, offering a seamless way to invest in physical gold through digital tokens. Investors can buy fractional shares of gold with the ease of cryptocurrency, while businesses gain new ways to raise capital. This move aligns with global trends, as institutions like BlackRock and Goldman Sachs tokenize billions in assets, and US regulators begin to clarify digital asset rules. Henry McPhie, CEO of BioSig and co-founder of Streamex, said, “The acquisition will be a defining moment for Streamex and BioSig. “Acquiring a regulated broker-dealer will help us build the infrastructure to lead the gold tokenization market in the US. “Our Nasdaq listing and gold-backed platform will unlock unprecedented opportunities for investors and reshape the $22 trillion gold market.” Morgan Lekstrom, executive chairman of the Company, added, “Tokenizing gold is the future of commodity finance. Streamex’s regulated approach and public market presence make it a pioneer in this transformative space, with the potential to redefine how investors access real assets.” The FINRA and SEC-registered broker-dealer, with a presence in the US, will provide Streamex with the regulatory framework to issue and trade tokenized assets under federal securities laws. Compliance Exchange Group (CXG), a leader in broker-dealer compliance, will oversee the acquisition to ensure seamless integration and adherence to regulations. This acquisition is a critical step toward scaling Streamex’s RWA tokenization platform nationwide. Streamex is a gold treasury and infrastructure company building the foundation for on-chain commodity markets. With a focus on RWA tokenization, Streamex is developing a vertically integrated platform that combines token issuance, trading infrastructure and physical gold holdings, positioning the Company to become one of Nasdaq’s largest public holders of gold bullion. This strategic approach aligns with Streamex’s mission to reshape global finance by bringing the approximately $142 trillion global commodities market on chain. By merging the security and trust of physical gold with the efficiency and transparency of blockchain, Streamex is creating scalable financial infrastructure for a new era of digital commodities. The Company plans to hold significant quantities of physical gold, securely vaulted through a top-tier bullion bank. Streamex will denominate the majority of its balance sheet in vaulted gold rather than fiat currency, supporting a long-term, value-based financial model. Combined with Streamex’s Solana-based blockchain infrastructure, this strategy enables a recurring revenue model that supports the issuance of gold-backed digital assets. Streamex is a wholly-owned subsidiary of BioSig Technologies, Inc. CXG specializes in building, managing and supporting broker-dealer infrastructure, offering full-service compliance, registration, principal outsourcing and advisory services. BioSig Technologies, Inc. is a medical device technology company with an advanced digital signal processing technology platform, the PURE EP Platform, that delivers insights to electrophysiologists for ablation treatments of cardiovascular arrhythmias. The PURE EP Platform enables electrophysiologists to acquire raw signal data in real-time – absent unnecessary noise or interference – to maximize procedural success and minimize unnecessary inefficiencies.

Title: Crypto Market Outlook: How Crypto Will Come of Age in 2025
URL: https://hackread.com/crypto-market-outlook-how-crypto-will-come-in-2025/
Time Published: 2025-07-14T12:09:13Z

2024 was a significant year for cryptocurrency markets, both in terms of growth, user adoption, investment, and technological progress. However, progress made in 2024 could seem minor compared to the possible changes ahead in 2025. Recent political changes in the United States point to the start of regulatory clarity. 2025 could be the year the crypto space, active since Bitcoin’s 2009 launch, finally comes into its own. This “clarity” could be a key step to completing crypto’s move from the financial fringes to the mainstream. From there, expect institutional adoption, already surging, to further accelerate. While nothing is certain, all of these factors point to another promising outcome for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, a possible move higher, as this asset class comes of age, bringing stronger market support. Over the past few years, the US cryptocurrency space has been operating with a high level of regulatory uncertainty. Crypto companies operating within the US contended with not just a lack of a regulatory framework, but aggressive enforcement actions from US securities regulators as well. Fortunately, this major headwind is soon coming to an end. On Jan. 20, the new Trump administration took office, promising major changes to US cryptocurrency policy. Based on statements made by the President, there is a strong likelihood that, perhaps within the first 100 days of his administration, the US federal government will commence implementing policy changes that promote the growth and adoption of cryptocurrencies. Binance CEO Richard Teng shares what he expects in the crypto industry in 2025: “Crypto regulation developments are expected from the new US government in 2025, which will encourage more crypto participation across the market, especially from US-based TradFi, and will help inform crypto legislation for other countries across the world.” Teng continued his comments, “There is also the potential of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve in the US, which could be a significant development and lead to many other countries doing the same. In this scenario, Bitcoin could one day grow to new heights in terms of adoption.” Included in these policy changes will likely be the implementation of a comprehensive regulatory framework. This will bring forth an era of regulatory clarity for US cryptocurrency companies. As this takes shape at the same time other major justifications establish regulatory frameworks of their own, expect this to be a game changer. Mostly, because this regulatory clarity stands to cement crypto’s status as a major asset class. In turn, count on this having a tremendous impact on the allocation of institutional capital into Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies, as well as into cryptocurrency investment products. Over the past year, the launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and other cryptocurrency exchange-traded products (ETPs) has resulted in massive inflows of institutional and retail investor capital into this space, to the tune of $44.2 billion. However, once comprehensive regulations are implemented, and US regulators go from an aggressive, sceptical stance to one supportive of industry growth, last year’s inflows could prove to be a drop in the bucket compared to future inflows of capital, especially from institutional investors. With major firms like Blackrock now recommending portfolio allocations of up to 2% into Bitcoin, in 2025 and beyond, it’s possible that institutional investors, ranging from state pension funds to sovereign wealth funds and university endowments, begin committing far greater amounts of capital, both directly into cryptocurrencies, as well as into ETPs like spot Bitcoin ETFs. Alongside investment into crypto itself, this asset class’ “coming of age” could also lead to increased venture capital investment into blockchain-based startups. According to recent data from the DeFi Report, blockchain-based startups obtained $13.6 billion in venture capital funding last year, a figure that this year could rise to as much as $18 billion. Considering the supportive conditions expected for crypto investment and adoption, it’s clear that there has been justification for the ramp-up in bullishness for Bitcoin and other cryptos over the past few months. Of course, nothing’s for certain. For instance, recently announced Federal Reserve policy changes have negatively impacted the short-term performance of most heavyweight cryptocurrencies. Further adjustments to Fed policy may have a similar impact. Still, given the potential for regulatory changes and other factors to finally trigger a “coming of age” moment for cryptocurrencies, this milestone may be significant enough to counter other concerns, resulting in further price appreciation for Bitcoin, major altcoins, and even help sustain recent high enthusiasm for speculative cryptos such as Meme coins.

Title: From Bitcoin to XRP: Key cryptocurrency terms and what they mean
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy5w2k5k5ylo
Time Published: 2025-07-14T11:27:58Z
Full Content:
Bitcoin's price reaching a new high of $120,000 (£89,000) - buoyed by US President Donald Trump's crypto-friendly stance - has kept the buzzy world of cryptocurrencies in the spotlight. But it also contains confusing terms such as ETFs, blockchains and cold wallets, that can make the topic somewhat tricky to navigate. Worry not. If you're hearing these for the first time, or simply need a refresher, here are a few key terms and what they mean. While many may struggle with the finer points of crypto, pretty much everyone has heard of its most famous product: Bitcoin. But what actually is it? Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, which is to say a type of digital currency. Unlike traditional currencies, Bitcoin is not controlled by centralised financial institutions. This makes it popular for people who think decentralisation can bring financial freedom, but it also makes it extremely volatile with it rising and falling in value at the whim of Bitcoin buyers and sellers. Donald Trump has pledged to make the US the "crypto capital of the world" - backtracking on his previous claim that Bitcoin was a "scam". Its price topped a much-awaited threshold of $100,000 in December 2024. In mid-July 2025, the price rose to $120,000 as US politicians prepared to begin debating bills that would regulate digital assets. But its price has been known to plummet just as quickly as it spikes. Blockchain is the technology underpinning all cryptocurrencies, and many related products like non-fungible tokens (NFTs). In essence, it is a virtual spreadsheet on which all the buying and selling of crypto is recorded. They are arranged in blocks linked together in a giant chain - hence the name. Every cryptocurrency transaction is individually recorded onto the blockchain by a huge network of volunteers verifying its authenticity by using computer programmes. The incentive to do this for Bitcoin's network is that the first person to validate transactions is rewarded in Bitcoin. This potentially lucrative process, known as mining, is also controversial because of the incredible amount of energy used as people the world over race to be the first to successfully update the blockchain. The blockchain is sustained by rewarding so-called "miners" - whose job it is to validate transactions - by paying them with the cryptocurrency. However, unlike some other digital currencies, there is not an infinite supply of Bitcoins. The amount that can be mined is capped at 21 million, and most are already in circulation. So roughly every four years - or when the Bitcoin blockchain reaches a certain size - the number of bitcoins rewarded to those who successfully validate transactions is cut in half. The most recent Bitcoin "halving" (or "halvening") event took place on 20 April 2024, reducing the reward for miners from 6.25 bitcoins to 3.125. This ensures Bitcoin's supply is drawn out for longer while demand, in theory, goes up over time. But with fewer rewards for miners, it can also lead some to consider whether it is financially worthwhile for them to continue the costly operation of running their powerful computers. A crypto exchange is the digital platform where investors can buy, sell and trade cryptocurrencies. Similar to traditional investing, a crypto exchange acts as a brokerage where people can transfer traditional money, like pounds or dollars, in exchange for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Most transactions are accompanied by fees. A crypto wallet is a place where investors hold their cryptocurrency. There are two types, a hot wallet and a cold wallet. Hot wallets are connected to the internet, and thus more accessible for quick transfers and easy access. Cold wallets are physical devices like specially designed USB sticks that store crypto offline typically for safer and longer term storage. Ethereum is used to describe both the second largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, represented by the Ether token, and the blockchain underpinning it. This supports an array of different applications and digital assets, such as non-fungible tokens. It functions in a similar way to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but in 2022 switched to a greener operating system requiring less computers and energy. ETFs are portfolios that let investors bet on multiple assets without having to buy any themselves. Traded on stock exchanges like shares, their value depends on how the overall portfolio performs in real time. They can comprise a combination of gold and silver bullion, for example, or a mix of shares in both technology and insurance companies. A spot Bitcoin ETF buys the cryptocurrency directly, "on the spot", at its current price, throughout the day. While some ETFs already contained Bitcoin indirectly, the US approved several spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024. This allowed new investors, such as investment management firms like Blackrock and Fidelity, to enter the speculative world of Bitcoin without having to worry about digital wallets or navigating crypto exchanges. Meme coins are a form of cryptocurrency used for fun and speculation. They are typically created to capitalise on social media trends or viral memes - such as for internet-famous pygmy hippo Moo Deng. But meme coins are heavily criticised for their speculative nature and the risk involved for investors, as they often have little prospect of accumulating value over time. They can also be susceptible to "rug pulls" - where promoters of a cryptocurrency draw in buyers to raise the price of their coin, only to stop trading activity and make off with the money raised from sales. Some celebrities have faced backlash after launching meme coins. "Stable" is the key word here - this cryptocurrency differs from others as it is intends to be less volatile in value. This typically works by the price being linked to an existing asset, for instance currencies like the US dollar or pound sterling, which in theory should make them more stable in price than cryptocurrencies that are not backed by assets. Stablecoins themselves are usually controlled by companies that provide them, with transactions recorded on digital ledgers. While held up by some as the future of finance, high profile price collapses of stablecoins have alerted regulators to risks for investors and prompted scrutiny over their supposed stability. XRP is a cryptocurrency used by a platform called the XRP Ledger. It was created by the co-founders of financial services company Ripple Labs in 2012 as a cheaper, faster alternative to Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency has a fixed supply of 100 billion coins, which were created when it launched. Much of it is held by Ripple and periodically released into circulation. Unlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, transactions made using XRP are verified through consensus - whereby the majority of validators on its peer-to-peer network must agree whether or not a transaction is valid before it is added to its blockchain. This has been credited with allowing many transactions to take place simultaneously, at high speed and low cost - making it appealing to financial institutions or for processes like cross-border payments. But as with other cryptocurrencies, XRP has received regulatory scrutiny and seen sudden, sharp declines in value.

Title: Know Why You Own Each of Your Investments

I probably don't write as often as I should about the mainstay of our portfolio (it might help if Vanguard, BlackRock, and Avantis were blog sponsors), which consists of low-cost, broadly diversified index and index-like traditional and exchange-traded mutual funds. It is important to understand WHY you own the investments you do (and to buy them for good reasons in the first place). So, today we'll go through each piece of our publicly traded portfolio (85% of the total portfolio) and discuss why we own what we own. We'll start at the asset allocation level for each asset class, then go to the subasset classes, move on to the actual investments, and finally arrive at some trivia questions. Sixty percent of our portfolio is invested in stocks because this allows us to participate in the earnings of the most profitable businesses the world has ever known. While risky, the expected and historical long-term returns of stocks allowed our portfolio to beat inflation and achieve our financial goals. More conservative investments simply don't grow as quickly as we need them to, due to lower rates of return. Forty percent of our portfolio (2/3 of stocks) is invested in domestic stocks. We spend dollars now, we expect to spend dollars later, and we think betting on the United States, despite its problems, is still a good idea. We have no problem with the majority of our stocks being in the US, even with the valuation differential between US and international stocks being as wide as it currently is after a long period of US outperformance. Twenty-five percent of our portfolio is in the Vanguard Total Stock Market Exchange Traded Fund (VTI). VTI provides a nearly free way to invest in the equivalent of all US publicly traded stocks. Vanguard has plenty of experience running index funds, and I trust them to do it well. We use the ETF version of the fund since this holding is in our taxable account, and while the ETF share class of Vanguard index funds isn't any more tax-efficient than the traditional mutual fund version, we find it far easier to find solid tax-loss harvesting (TLH) partners for it. Plus, I like the additional control over the process that ETFs offer. It's not entirely true that 25% of our portfolio is in VTI. It is true that 25% of our portfolio is in VTI + ITOT (currently about 84% VTI). The iShares Total Stock Market ETF (ITOT) is BlackRock's version of VTI, and it does almost as good a job. We certainly have no qualms holding shares of ITOT until the day we die, and while it isn't “substantially identical”(the words the IRS uses) to VTI, the performance is so similar it makes a great tax-loss harvesting partner. Are there other great ways to invest in the overall US stock market? Yes, there are. We don't think any of them are significantly better than these, though, and lots of them are significantly worse. More information here: The Nuts and Bolts of Investing How Do You Evaluate and Compare Mutual Funds and Exchange Traded Funds? As I write this post in June 2025, the US stock market is up 2.19% on the year, and the international stock market is up 15.76%. That, in short, is why I invest in international stocks. Sometimes international stocks outperform US stocks. Both are risky asset classes, but they don't have perfect correlation with each other. Not only does including international stocks in the portfolio increase diversification by adding thousands of additional companies to the portfolio, but it also provides geographic and currency diversification. I expect both US and international stocks to beat inflation (and less risky investments like bonds) in the long term, and there will be times (like 2025) when US stocks zig and international stocks zag. Fifteen percent of our portfolio is in the Vanguard Total International Stock Market Index ETF (VXUS). Since I started investing in this fund two decades ago, the expense ratio has fallen and fallen and fallen. Now, like VTI, it's essentially free at just five basis points. For five basis points a year and 30 seconds of my time, I can own >8,600 stocks in 51 countries. That's a deal. Just like we need a TLHing partner for VTI (ITOT), we also need one for VXUS. This partner is the iShares Total International Stock Market ETF (IXUS). It's almost as cheap and almost as good, and we certainly don't mind holding shares of it forever. One could argue that other partners might be better, but nobody can argue another partner is MUCH better. IXUS is good enough. Which is good, because something like 99% of our money in this asset class is currently in IXUS due to some TLHing timing. Twenty percent of our portfolio is invested in small value (SV) stocks (15% US and 5% international). Small and value stocks have shown higher long-term returns across multiple countries and time periods. This is due to both risk reasons (smaller and more valuey stocks are more likely to go out of business; they're riskier investments) and behavioral reasons (large growth stocks are better known, much sexier, more comfortable, and easier to own). Now in our third decade as investors, we continue this tilt. While this decision has not paid off so far, that is offset by the fact that the valuation gap between large growth stocks and small value stocks has rarely been higher and the fact that staying the course with any reasonable plan is more important than what that plan is. Our plan is reasonable, and sticking with it has helped us to accomplish all of our goals. We'll stick with it some more. Once you've chosen to tilt your portfolio, deciding on small value funds to do it with is a lot harder than just choosing some Total Stock Market (TSM) funds. Originally, we used the Vanguard Small Value Fund and then ETF (VBR) with the Vanguard S&P Small Cap Value 600 ETF (VIOV) as the TLHing partner. However, I've always admired Dimensional Funds, particularly after some of their staff left Dimensional, founded Avantis, and began offering ETFs that didn't require advisory fees. After careful analysis, we decided to move our small value funds to the Avantis Small Cap Value ETF (AVUV). While the cost is not “Vanguard-low” at 25 basis points, it wasn't that long ago that we paid that much for Vanguard index funds. We think the additional cost is worth it. It is much smaller and a little more valuey than the Vanguard options, and we think the DFA/Avantis experience with small value and little tweaks to the index fund process (passive philosophy with active implementation) is worthwhile. Since we own AVUV in taxable, we need a TLHing partner for it. Once DFA saw Avantis start ETFs, Dimensional finally got on board with it. Now, it offers its own funds in ETF versions without an advisor requirement. We use the Dimensional Small Value ETF (DFSV) as a TLHing partner for AVUV. Unfortunately, we decided to switch to Avantis/DFA small value ETFs after we had started moving small value funds into our taxable account, creating a legacy investment issue. Our method of dealing with legacy investments is to use them for our charitable contributions. We just have so many of them after switching to Avantis/DFA ETFs that it's going to take a while to get rid of them, even given our usual levels of charitable giving. Just like we have AVUV on the domestic side, we need a holding on the international side. For a long time, we didn't see a great option for a small value international fund. So, we used the Vanguard Small Cap ETF (VSS). Now, we use the Avantis Small Cap Value ETF (AVDV). We don't like that (unlike VSS) it avoids emerging market (EM) stocks, but we'd prefer to get the value tilt than to have EM stocks. The Dimensional Small Value ETF (DISV) is the obvious tax-loss harvesting partner for AVDV. I'm not thrilled about the 42 basis point expense ratio (I don't even like the 36 basis point ER for AVDV), but I think it's worth it. There aren't a lot of other options in this space, and I think these two are the best of them. Which of the two is the very best is hard to say, but over the last three years, DISV has had a slight edge (13.02% vs 12.93% per year). Which is fine since we have similar amounts in each of them. Again, this is a legacy holding in taxable. We still own some VSS. In fact, about half of our “international small cap” allocation is still in VSS, but that's where charitable contributions came from last year, where they will come from this year, and probably where they'll come from the year after that. Then, we'll go back after that to VIOV. I'd rather wait to have exactly what I want than to realize capital gains. VSS is good enough for now. We owned it for years, so we're obviously fine with it. More information here: Value Tilt – Don’t Give Up on Your Small-Cap Value Strategy Avantis vs. Vanguard: Does It Make Sense to Switch Up Your Portfolio? Twenty percent of our portfolio is in bonds. Bonds haven't been very popular in the last few years. Part of that is the incredible run that the US stock market has had over the last 10-15 years. Part of it is that 2022 was the worst year for bonds . . . ever. Frankly, a lot of the “100% stock” folks are just performance chasing. Many of them will “discover” bonds after selling stocks low during the next big downturn. We own bonds for several reasons: We have always split our bond portfolio in half with 50% nominal bonds and 50% inflation-indexed bonds. We're somewhat agnostic about which will outperform, but we think a healthy dose of inflation-indexed bonds is wise, given that inflation is the biggest long-term risk to bonds. We used to use the Vanguard Inflation Protected Securities Fund (VAIPX), but when our 401(k)s ended up at Schwab and Fidelity, I wasn't willing to pay additional fees (there is no ETF version) to buy it. We started using the Schwab TIPS ETF (SCHP), which we've now been using for years. Even now that some of our TIPS are moving into taxable, we still find it a reasonable holding to use. We've never had to TLH it either, so it is our only TIPS bond fund. (If we ever do, I'd probably use TIP, the iShares TIPS ETF.) SCHP is 1/6th the cost of TIP, and it's about the same size with similar holdings and with a slightly better past performance. There was a time when we were seduced by the merits of individual Treasury bonds. Having no expense ratio and no possible loss of principal when held to maturity are compelling arguments. But so is simplicity. And SCHP is simpler than individual TIPS, especially when dealing with the TreasuryDirect website. So, we plan to close our TreasuryDirect accounts and eventually get out of the individual TIPS game by moving proceeds when they mature into SCHP. Series I Saving Bonds (I Bonds) are another great inflation-indexed type of bond. They work slightly differently than TIPS (and worked A LOT better in 2022 for various reasons). They're very low-risk investments. However, they have a couple of big downsides. The first is that you must have a TreasuryDirect account to buy them, and if you've ever logged into a government account, you know why this is a downside. The second is that you can only buy $10,000 (per entity) per year. That makes them a fine investment if you're not that rich or if you became rich over many years while buying I Bonds each year. Neither of those describes us. We don't and will never have enough I Bonds in our portfolio to justify holding them at all, so we plan to close our TreasuryDirect accounts soon, liquidate the I Bonds, and move the proceeds into SCHP. It's a bit of a legacy investment issue, but it's not too painful since the gains just aren't very high because I Bonds don't have very high returns (well, except in 2021-2022). I spent four years on active duty, and I was thus eligible to make Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) contributions. We also rolled over an old SEP-IRA and a couple of cash balance plans into the TSP after I left service. While it was once the largest part of our portfolio, the TSP slowly became less and less significant. I love the G Fund. Treasury returns for money market risk; it's one of the few free lunches in investing. But it is also on the chopping block for us, simply to reduce the number of accounts to manage. Inertia, nostalgia, and that pesky free lunch are keeping it alive so far. Most of our bonds, like most of our portfolio, are now held in a taxable account. Since we're in the top tax bracket, that means using municipal bonds. Our chosen holding here is the Vanguard Intermediate Term Tax Exempt Fund (VWIUX). Technically not an index fund, its turnover is about 30% (still low for intermediate bonds), and it charges nine basis points. It has over 14,000 bonds in it and a duration of just under six years. We find intermediate munis to be at the sweet spot for bonds—attractive due to a higher yield than short-term munis with lower volatility than long-term munis. We have had to TLH VWIUX, so we also own the Vanguard Tax Exempt Bond Index Fund (VTEAX). It is a true index fund, and it has a slightly lower ER (seven basis points) and an ETF version (three basis points). The duration is slightly longer (seven years), but the turnover is a little lower (20%) and the yields are very similar. VWIUX gets the performance nod, but VTEAX is still good enough for a TLHing partner. More information here: I Bonds and TIPS: Which Inflation-Indexed Bond Should You Buy Now? The G Fund (Finally) Gets Its Day in the Sun Twenty percent of our portfolio is invested in real estate. As I have often told WCIers, real estate is optional as asset classes go. Bonds are optional to some WCIers, though, and I suppose stocks could be optional too, so long as there is plenty of real estate in the portfolio. But I see little reason to come down definitively on one side of the stocks vs. real estate debate. I never have. Real estate has lots of advantages, including: Of all the “alternative” investments out there, I find real estate the most attractive. It has a very long track record, and it is easily understood. (Buy property, rent it out, pay all expenses with the rent, and keep what's left.) Stocks, bonds, and real estate. That's what we invest in. Yes, I know there are lots of other things out there to invest in, including: But, like real estate, they're all optional. Unlike real estate, they don't all have the above advantages (to be fair, I think cryptoassets like Bitcoin may be THE most tax-efficient assets on the planet as long as you never need to spend anything, and even then, it's not too bad). Our primary real estate holding for many years was simply the Vanguard Real Estate Index Fund or ETF (VNQ), and it still makes up 5% of our portfolio. VNQ owns all the equity Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) traded publicly in the United States. We have also invested directly (been landlords) and invested in a large number of private syndications and funds. Sometimes I'm asked by real estate doubters why I don't just buy VNQ. Well, we do. We own a lot of it. We've only ever owned it in tax-protected accounts, so I've never bothered looking very hard for a TLHing partner. But it wouldn't be the worst thing to have in a taxable account (that would be a private real estate debt fund). Let's spend a few minutes answering questions I often get about our portfolio. You don't have to invest in everything to be successful. Choose a reasonably diversified asset allocation, pick a few funds to give you that allocation, and move on. How much money you make, how much of it you save, and how well you stay the course with your written investing plan will make a far bigger difference in your financial outcomes than your exact asset allocation or investments. We specifically avoid speculative investments—those that do not produce interest, dividends, earnings, or rents. These include precious metals, cryptoassets, art, collectibles, empty land, commodities, derivatives, and more. We also avoid picking individual stocks, fun money accounts, active managers trying to beat the market, and other investment techniques shown to have poor outcomes most of the time. Simplicity. I think a great argument can be made for having three asset/subasset classes in your portfolio. A good argument can be made up to seven. One can still argue effectively for perhaps 10. Beyond that point, you're just playing with your money, especially when you're putting 1% in this and 2% in that. Investing is about reaching your goals while taking on the minimum amount of risk and complexity. It's a single-player game. My fun money gets spent on rafting gear and international travel, not gambling on the latest meme stock or crypto fad. You don't have to invest in everything to be successful, and most investment “collectors” eventually regret it. Fifteen percent is invested in private real estate: 10% on the equity side and 5% on the debt side. More details here. There are plenty of reasonable ways to invest in fixed income. If you think it really matters which of those reasonable methods you choose, you're mistaken. Your chosen way is probably fine. We prefer to take our risk on the equity side, so we keep term risk short to intermediate and minimize credit risk. I want YOU to have the ability to do THIS exercise with YOUR OWN portfolio. You need to know why you own every one of the investments you own. And if you don't have a good reason, it's time to get rid of it, especially in a tax-protected account where there are no tax consequences to doing so. If it has a large amount of capital gains in a taxable account, then perhaps it becomes a legacy investment until you give it away or die. What do you think? Why do you own each of your investments? Why is it important to understand the role of each of your investments in your portfolio? Hi Dr. Dahle, I found i t difficult to purchase ETF (v.s index fund) regularly because ETF price is fluctuating during the day and it’s hard to make a decision when to buy. I often set a limit price and when market price does not drop to that level, the order goes unfilled for many days or even weeks/months. If I purchase index fund (FSGGX, FXAIX), I can just set automatic investment to purchase 4 times a month at certain days of the months. Do you set up limit price to purchase ETF? If not, do you purchase at certain time of the day to avoid artificially inflated price? Vanguard launched a total TIPS etf last week (ticker:VTP, ER: 0.05%) similar to schp … not a different share class of vaipx, but a new fund it seems “We don’t need to take 100% stock risk to make the money we don’t need to buy the things we don’t want to impress people we don’t even like.” Dr. Dahle, I loved this. Wish more people had this philosophy! Really great post—super clear and helpful, as always. I especially liked the reminder to know why you own what you own. That part alone is worth revisiting regularly. A few quick questions I’ve had trouble finding solid answers on (maybe you’ve written about these before and I missed it?): 1. Have you ever done a post breaking down how you approach tax-loss harvesting? I know it’s valuable, but it’s tough to find good info that’s not just a sales pitch for a managed account. Curious how you do it and what you think the actual benefit is in bps per year. Also wondering what level of complexity gets you most of the value without turning it into a part-time job. 2. From an asset location standpoint, are your TIPS in retirement accounts, or do you mix in taxable now too? 3. For the TIPS side of your bond allocation, have you ever thought about just skipping TreasuryDirect and ETFs, and doing non-competitive bids at auction through a brokerage to build a ladder that covers, say, X years of living expenses? Seems like a way to get peace of mind and not have to worry about selling stocks in a downturn. Thanks again for continuing to share all of this—it’s consistently some of the most practical stuff out there. How much return do anticipate that your private real estate investments will provide compared to VNQ? What about compared to total international or total (US) market? I’ve held VNQ (10% of my portfolio) or its mutual fund equivalent for 20 plus year as REITs were highly promoted in the random walk down Wall Street and David Swenson’s book that I read 25 years ago when designing my portfolio. I’m conflicted on whether to keep, though. Some say that reits is a sector bet and not worth it. On the other hand the 90% payout rule is a good way to distribute profits to investors instead of burning up on crazy schemes like the metaverse. If I dropped reits the alternative would be to buy more international as it’s currently 25% of my portfolio. Still accumulating — of course don’t want to buy international now as that would be performance chasing (based on last 6 months) so I’ll likely just keep. No interest in private real estate as no interest in complicating my taxes. Your article on your multiple state income taxes was enlightening. Since I’m a do it myself tax preparer as well as investor that sounds like a nightmare. Thank you. Love it. Simple. You give asset allocation. The actual products you buy. You also are aware of your behavioural patterns. Really useful(especially because I’m debating more bonds-midlife/post midlife reluctantly.. accumulation phase), but also getting enough assets to want to start to err on protection. I also like that you’re simplifying accounts. Honestly when you go through your private real estate holdings i get palpitations. Maybe it’s the unknown but too complicated for me. Thanks again.

Title: War Takes Everything
URL: https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2025/07/war_takes_everything.html
Time Published: 2025-07-14T04:00:00Z
Full Content:
As Peter Schweizer noted in a short report for the Hoover Institution on Christmas Day 2000, twenty-five years ago the United States was “spending less on defense as a percentage of GNP than anytime since the Great Depression.” That all changed nine months later when the so-called “peace dividend” from the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War was reinvested in a “Global War on Terrorism.” Eight trillion dollars later, and what do Americans have to show for their sacrifices in blood and treasure? The Taliban is in control of Afghanistan, al-Qaeda is in control of Syria, an apologist for Islamic jihad is about to become mayor of New York City, and a pro-Hamas contingent of lawmakers wields too much power in Congress. In an article that resembles an obituary for U.S. foreign policy during the twenty-first century, writer Daniel McAdams dryly observes in the headline, “‘Global War on Terror’ Is Over. Terror Won.” That’s quite the gut punch for everyone who lived through 9/11 and its aftermath. Yet it’s hardly inaccurate. A quarter-century after Islamic terrorists murdered three thousand Americans, politicians are more concerned about “Islamophobia” in the United States than providing adequate care for veterans who confronted Islamic barbarity head-on. The hurt feelings of those who risked nothing to defend the homeland matter more than the damaged bodies and minds of those who risked everything. The significance of 9/11 has been so watered-down that Congresswoman Ilhan Omar remembers it only as a day when “some people did something.” For the victims we lost, their families, members of the military who fought and died on the global battlefield, and the families of those servicemembers who never saw their loved ones again, that “something” was — by far — the most consequential event in their lives. Now it’s just an opportunity for foreigners who become members of Congress to guilt-trip white people for their imaginary “privilege.” After 9/11, everybody insisted that we left our guard down and somehow brought the tragedy upon ourselves. If we had only continued spending on defense at the same high levels that we had been spending since WWII, then we could have prevented the worst attack on American soil since the Japanese Empire bombed Pearl Harbor in 1941. That was the supposed lesson. It didn’t matter that we were still spending more than every other country in the world; as soon as we cut back on Cold War military spending, we suffered another surprise attack. We were vulnerable, everyone agreed, unless we rededicated tax dollars toward huge military budgets. Everybody in the defense sector got big buckets of money after that. Weapons manufacturers, research and development firms, intelligence think tanks, and foreign policy consultants made out like bandits. The FBI got new domestic surveillance powers. The Department of Homeland Security and Transportation Security Administration came into existence. The CIA positioned itself once again as the unofficial quarterback of the U.S. government. Unelected bureaucrats, in other words, became much more powerful than they were before 9/11, and the defense industry started cashing much bigger checks. All the institutions that experienced a diminishment of clout and prestige after the Cold War found their clout and prestige supercharged in the post-9/11 world. That’s a pretty sobering reminder that some people always benefit from tragedy. How did the American people make out? Not so well. In return for a foreign attack on U.S. soil, American citizens lost any claims to their privacy. The Patriot Act (apparently already written and ready to be signed into law as soon as a sufficient emergency could justify its passage in Congress) birthed the modern national security surveillance State. Americans lost control over their bank records, phone calls, text messages, and emails. It became common to hear politicians justify this loss of personal privacy as a trifling matter for Americans with nothing to hide. On 9/11, foreign terrorists murdered U.S. citizens; after 9/11, the U.S. government murdered the Fourth Amendment. Americans also saw the accelerated migration of foreign nationals into their local communities. Both George W. Bush and Barack Obama seemed to agree that American citizens were responsible not only for prosecuting a “Global War on Terrorism” but also for resettling “refugees” from newly occupied territories into the United States. The end result has been a confusing and disruptive injection of multiculturalism this century. Had Americans known that defending their way of life would involve importing millions of foreign nationals with a different way of life, many never would have supported post-9/11 wars in parts of Asia and Africa and across the Middle East. Effectively, the U.S. government responded to the worst attack since WWII by going to war for two decades, tearing up parts of the Constitution, and undermining Americans’ shared culture. Those politicians and bureaucrats in D.C. who have seen their powers expand this century believe the enormous costs in lives and dollars are justified. Those industries that profit from endless war have had much to celebrate. For many Americans, however, the butcher’s bill from this century’s military conflicts has not been pretty. Right now the drumbeat of war is growing louder. U.S. and European interests see Ukraine as an expendable chess piece in a larger NATO-led war against Russia. As the death toll in Europe rises, Western war-hawks continue to demand that every last Ukrainian man be press-ganged into service. I have made no secret of my contempt for those who insist that Ukrainians die in this war when they are not permitted to vote for elected representatives or even to dissent publicly from the government currently hanging onto power through martial law. There is nothing “democratic” about this Ukrainian dictatorship. I dislike the Council on Foreign Relations types who lick their chops over the possibility of defeating Russia and dismantling its enormous territory into more digestible parts. I dislike the BlackRock vultures that can’t wait to gobble up the region’s natural resources while making trillions of dollars from government-subsidized rebuilding projects across the war-torn terrain. I dislike the bloodthirsty loudmouths, such as Lindsey Graham, who speak of war as if it’s a playground game.

As Peter Schweizer noted in a short report for the Hoover Institution on Christmas Day 2000, twenty-five years ago the United States was “spending less on defense as a percentage of GNP than anytime since the Great Depression.” That all changed nine months later when the so-called “peace dividend” from the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War was reinvested in a “Global War on Terrorism.” Eight trillion dollars later, and what do Americans have to show for their sacrifices in blood and treasure? The Taliban is in control of Afghanistan, al-Qaeda is in control of Syria, an apologist for Islamic jihad is about to become mayor of New York City, and a pro-Hamas contingent of lawmakers wields too much power in Congress. In an article that resembles an obituary for U.S. foreign policy during the twenty-first century, writer Daniel McAdams dryly observes in the headline, “‘Global War on Terror’ Is Over. Terror Won.” That’s quite the gut punch for everyone who lived through 9/11 and its aftermath. Yet it’s hardly inaccurate. A quarter-century after Islamic terrorists murdered three thousand Americans, politicians are more concerned about “Islamophobia” in the United States than providing adequate care for veterans who confronted Islamic barbarity head-on. The hurt feelings of those who risked nothing to defend the homeland matter more than the damaged bodies and minds of those who risked everything. The significance of 9/11 has been so watered-down that Congresswoman Ilhan Omar remembers it only as a day when “some people did something.” For the victims we lost, their families, members of the military who fought and died on the global battlefield, and the families of those servicemembers who never saw their loved ones again, that “something” was — by far — the most consequential event in their lives. Now it’s just an opportunity for foreigners who become members of Congress to guilt-trip white people for their imaginary “privilege.” After 9/11, everybody insisted that we left our guard down and somehow brought the tragedy upon ourselves. If we had only continued spending on defense at the same high levels that we had been spending since WWII, then we could have prevented the worst attack on American soil since the Japanese Empire bombed Pearl Harbor in 1941. That was the supposed lesson. It didn’t matter that we were still spending more than every other country in the world; as soon as we cut back on Cold War military spending, we suffered another surprise attack. We were vulnerable, everyone agreed, unless we rededicated tax dollars toward huge military budgets. Everybody in the defense sector got big buckets of money after that. Weapons manufacturers, research and development firms, intelligence think tanks, and foreign policy consultants made out like bandits. The FBI got new domestic surveillance powers. The Department of Homeland Security and Transportation Security Administration came into existence. The CIA positioned itself once again as the unofficial quarterback of the U.S. government. Unelected bureaucrats, in other words, became much more powerful than they were before 9/11, and the defense industry started cashing much bigger checks. All the institutions that experienced a diminishment of clout and prestige after the Cold War found their clout and prestige supercharged in the post-9/11 world. That’s a pretty sobering reminder that some people always benefit from tragedy. How did the American people make out? Not so well. In return for a foreign attack on U.S. soil, American citizens lost any claims to their privacy. The Patriot Act (apparently already written and ready to be signed into law as soon as a sufficient emergency could justify its passage in Congress) birthed the modern national security surveillance State. Americans lost control over their bank records, phone calls, text messages, and emails. It became common to hear politicians justify this loss of personal privacy as a trifling matter for Americans with nothing to hide. On 9/11, foreign terrorists murdered U.S. citizens; after 9/11, the U.S. government murdered the Fourth Amendment. Americans also saw the accelerated migration of foreign nationals into their local communities. Both George W. Bush and Barack Obama seemed to agree that American citizens were responsible not only for prosecuting a “Global War on Terrorism” but also for resettling “refugees” from newly occupied territories into the United States. The end result has been a confusing and disruptive injection of multiculturalism this century. Had Americans known that defending their way of life would involve importing millions of foreign nationals with a different way of life, many never would have supported post-9/11 wars in parts of Asia and Africa and across the Middle East. Effectively, the U.S. government responded to the worst attack since WWII by going to war for two decades, tearing up parts of the Constitution, and undermining Americans’ shared culture. Those politicians and bureaucrats in D.C. who have seen their powers expand this century believe the enormous costs in lives and dollars are justified. Those industries that profit from endless war have had much to celebrate. For many Americans, however, the butcher’s bill from this century’s military conflicts has not been pretty. Right now the drumbeat of war is growing louder. U.S. and European interests see Ukraine as an expendable chess piece in a larger NATO-led war against Russia. As the death toll in Europe rises, Western war-hawks continue to demand that every last Ukrainian man be press-ganged into service. I have made no secret of my contempt for those who insist that Ukrainians die in this war when they are not permitted to vote for elected representatives or even to dissent publicly from the government currently hanging onto power through martial law. There is nothing “democratic” about this Ukrainian dictatorship. I dislike the Council on Foreign Relations types who lick their chops over the possibility of defeating Russia and dismantling its enormous territory into more digestible parts. I dislike the BlackRock vultures that can’t wait to gobble up the region’s natural resources while making trillions of dollars from government-subsidized rebuilding projects across the war-torn terrain. I dislike the bloodthirsty loudmouths, such as Lindsey Graham, who speak of war as if it’s a playground game. I dislike the Machiavellian politicians (particularly in Europe) who see the War in Ukraine as a convenient distraction from the exorbitant energy costs of “climate change” communism presently destroying Western economies. I dislike those who would risk miscalculations between nuclear powers over former Soviet lands whose peoples largely identify as Russian. I dislike those who prefer that Russian and Ukrainian Christians kill each other rather than seek peace.

Title: Will US Exchanges Follow The Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE)’s Lead In Nudging Chronic Underperformers?

Full Content:
ByShivaram Rajgopal ByShivaram Rajgopal, Contributor. Senso-Ji ancient buddhist temple illuminated at night in Asakusa. Senso-Ji is Tokyo's oldest and ... More most significant temple The TSE asks firms with price to book (P/B) of less than 1 to publish turnaround plans. Around 23% of US firms have a P/B less than 1. In March 2023, the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) put out an interesting rule/nudge or guidance: companies on the TSE, whose P/B ratio was less than one, over multiple years, are encouraged to disclose, on an annual basis, information on specific initiatives to improve profitability and market valuation, as well as the schedule for their implementation. Companies risk delisting if these directives are not followed. This is an intriguing nudge to get under-performers to publicly discuss plans for turning themselves around or for cash hoarders to buy back stock and/or payout dividends. The rule is especially pertinent to a market like Japan where shareholder activism is still at a nascent stage which in turn makes it becomes difficult for shareholder activists such an Elliott or a Trian to target such under-performers. What is so special about P/B struggling at less than one for a while? No one ratio or metric is ever definitive. But, P/B < 1 is a quick and easy heuristic symptomatic of problems that deserve the CEO’s and board’s attention: (i) the company’s future earnings stream does not even pay for the cost of equity held in the firm; (ii) the firm is sitting on assets over-valued in its books and the market is asking the firm to take a write down (a topic I had covered a while ago); (iii) the firm has negative debt (or cash in excess of debt) suggesting that is either under-levered or is better off returning cash to shareholders who can earn a higher rate of return than the firm can generate on cash, either held in marketable securities or invested in the business; or (iv) the firm is doing fine but the stock market has somehow not acknowledged its long term prospects. The US, to some extent, has the same problem. I found 1,547 firms, out of 6,829 firms listed on major US exchanges (including mutual funds and class A and B shares and ADRs), that report a P/B ratio of less than one as of 6/30/2025. Of these, 756 are listed on the NYSE and the remaining 791 are on NASDAQ. Of the 1,547 firms, 1,007 trade at a price above $5 a share, suggesting that many of these firms are not trivially small. Thus, 23% of US firms (1,547/6,829) or nearly a fourth of the sample have P/B ratio of less than one, despite the historical heights that US markets have scaled, of late. When I ran the same screen for the Tokyo Stock Exchange, I ended up with 1,668 firms out of a total of 4,333 firms (38%) with a P/B less than one. Yes, the proportion is higher for the TSE but a 23% number for US exchanges still sounds quite high to me. Surprisingly, many prominent US listed firms report a P/B of less than one: Citibank, Baidu, Rogers Corporation, KB Home, General Motors, Molson Coors, United Bancshares, Arcelor Mittal, Fresh Del Monte Produce, Ziff Davis, Echostar, Honda Motor Company, Deutsche Bank, Harley Davidson, Foot Locker, Murphy Oil, Sirius XM, Barclays, Paramount, Ford Motor Company, Liberty Energy, several Invesco, Nuveen and Blackrock funds, Biovie, Kohl’s, Clarivate, and Lloyds Banking Corporation. Nearly a fourth of the market is simply too long a list for activists to go after, even in the US, setting aside any considerations of a financial return to activism. I have highlighted how many of these firms potentially have an agency problem in that the board or the CEO is stuck and somehow unable to break the rut and the usual checks and balance such as relatively passive institutional holders, proxy advisors or even index makers such as S&P have not pressured them to turn things around. When the usual checks and balances fail, can and should the exchange step in? Will US exchanges be willing to follow TSE’s lead and announce a similar rule asking managers to share concrete plans for a turnaround? Has the TSE’s plan worked in Japan? It might be too early to tell for sure but companies have started sharing concrete initiatives. For instance, A lot of this looks and sounds like Financial Management 101 but it is not a bad idea to force CEOs and boards to acknowledge their laggard status and ask for concrete steps they plan on taking to improve return on shareholder capital. What about enforcement? Aside from the threat of delisting, short-listing the P/B laggards could potentially spotlight these firms and on the margin, goad institutional investors, index providers, proxy advisors, sell side analysts and rating agencies to hold management’s feet to the fire in making sure that the announced plans are followed through. Will the NYSE and NASDAQ consider TSE’s out-of-the-box idea to pull up chronic under-performers?

Title: Swiss Bishop Criticizes Marginalization and Polemics Against Roman Rite Catholics

Skip to comments. Posted on 07/13/2025 2:57:06 PM PDT by ebb tide Swiss Bishop Criticizes Marginalization and Polemics Against Roman Rite CatholicsBishop Emeritus Marian Eleganti, 70, of Switzerland, spoke with Gloria.tv about the Church and politics. Here are the main points. Full German video below.- In the Middle Ages, a Christian cosmos centred on the cathedral developed, incorporating also schools and charitable institutions. This has largely been destroyed since the Enlightenment. All godless substitute empires, such as communism and National Socialism, have failed. Now, transhumanism is attempting to recreate the human being independently of God.- There are destructive forces at work. If you look closely, you will see that they are always directed against Christianity, or more precisely, against the Catholic Church. This is supernatural. The Church has a divine origin, with the Son of God living within it in a mysterious way. The demonic, evil, anti-Christian spirit creates a counter-realm and targets Christ, its arch-enemy.- Anti-Christian forces are forming unholy alliances, for example between left-wing fascism and Islam. This enemy takes on different guises, using lies and deception, and will stop at nothing. Disguised as goodness, it makes promises that will not come.- It is an incredible way of speaking [by the German Synod] to define the sinful reality of lived sexuality - adultery, promiscuity, etc - as a source of revelation.- In the Corona era, it could be observed that the Church was a servant of the state at the expense of her faith. The Church is always threatened by embracing the world and political forces. This can be seen with taxes in German-speaking countries and sinicisation in China.- If the Church no longer believes and the thinking of bishops and Christians becomes secularised, then the Church becomes an NGO and a social institute, but not a sacrament of salvation. It then proclaims psychology, but not the supernatural presence of God.- The Church should not get involved in the dialog of contradictory scientific opinions - for example on climate change - and become an advocate for agendas, for example from the UN.- If politicians have enough power and money, they can get away with any injustice. This happens on a grand scale. Christine Lagarde, President of the European Central Bank, has burned huge sums of tax money and is not punished because of her “special personality”. Marine Le Pen wouldn’t get away with embezzlement. I don't want to rate that, I just see the different standards.- The principle of subsidiarity would prevent a concentration of power at the highest level, which could then tyrannize and dominate the masses. A country like Switzerland can decide what is good locally better than politicians in faraway Brussels.- Overall, I am an opponent of globalism and global structures. You can't govern so many people in a drop-down system. To keep this under control, you have to install more and more mechanisms that manipulate the masses, keep them in line and take away their freedom.- Attempts have been made - and this is perhaps still topical - to strive for a new world order. The elites also organize among themselves, the Bilderberg Conference or the World Economic Forum. These are exchange platforms where those who really have power and a lot of money can come together and establish a program, a strategy. Democratic control is needed here.- There is a concentration of power in a few hands, for example in asset managers such as BlackRock, whose budgets exceed the gross national product of entire countries. These are bodies without political control. They can decide autonomously.- The national parliaments and politicians are actually just shadowy figures of the donors in the background, who can no longer really make autonomous decisions.- Many images of the Apocalypse - such as animals with many heads and horns or the sign to buy and sell - play out before our eyes.- Ideologies - such as the gender ideology - are deconstructive. This not only affects the old social order, but also leads to the deconstruction of truth and reason. There is then no longer even a truth about human nature. Everything becomes the arbitrariness of feelings or interests. This can then be enforced by law.- Ideologies begin with the redefinition of language. The core of the matter is removed and only the shell is left. People talk about democracy, but there is no longer any democracy inside. You can say it's a democracy promotion law, but it's actually censorship. The protection of the narrative propagated by the state is referred to as the protection of democracy, as protection against fake news. That is the end of freedom of speech.- Theologians are the most refined sophists. And bishops have also mastered this art of speech, of saying something and nothing at the same time.- I started as an altar boy in the old rite and then retrained. I normally celebrate in the Novus Ordo. I am only now beginning to reflect on these things retrospectively: Why have these beautiful texts - such as the prayers at the Foot of the Altar or at the offertory - been canceled at the desk? These prayers also help the priest who is celebrating.- I learned the old rite because a priest from the Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter asked me to do a confirmation. He has a very lively congregation with families and young people.- It is a time-honored liturgy that has been celebrated for almost 2000 years. We have around 24 rites in the Church. Why the marginalization or polemic of the faithful who love this rite?- I have wondered why the Second Vatican Council did not bring about a flowering of Faith. Paul VI already lamented this: Why was there not a renewal, but such a loss of Faith?- If you look at France, there were over 19,000 pilgrims on the pilgrimage from Paris to Chartres at Pentecost 2025 and the average age was 20. That's a generation that doesn't even know the texts of the Council. And I don't want to ask who among them has ever read an entire council text, for example Dei Verbum.- The old liturgy is very theocentric, Christocentric and the priest therefore has the central role. In the new liturgy, the danger is that the priest, who looks at the people, becomes almost like a moderator.- In the Novus Ordo, Christ's death on the cross, is overwritten by different themes. At First Communion, the rainbow is suddenly the theme. Or there is a crawling liturgy for toddlers, or a women's liturgy. The result is a workshop liturgy in which the essence is no longer recognizable. In the old Mass, the liturgical meaning is embodied in the form.

It is a central tenet of Christianity that Jesus’ sacrifice makes animal sacrifice obsolete. Roman practice has nothing to do with it.

In a similar way, when supper was ended, he took this precious chalice in his holy and venerable hands, and once more giving you thanks, he said the blessing and gave the chalice to his disciples, saying: Take this, all of you, and drink from it, for this is the chalice of my Blood, the Blood of the new and eternal covenant, which will be poured out for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 8 | View Replies] To: Dr. Franklin The Romans weren't big into worshipping the "rising sun," so it seems like you're just grasping for something that sticks. Jesus and the Apostles at the Last Supper were probably using the customary Greco-Roman posture for eating a banquet, which was to recline around a low table. Not sure how that could possibly work in a cathedral with 3000 people in attendance. The early Christians compared Christ and his coming to the rising of the sun. There's plenty of Biblical warrant for this, see Malachi 4:2, Matthew 24:27, etc. That's where "liturgical east" comes from, not from any kind of pagan syncretism. 13 posted on 07/14/2025 7:43:09 AM PDT by Campion (Everything is a grace, everything is the direct effect of our Father's love - Little Flower) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 9 | View Replies] To: Dr. Franklin Roman “animal sacrifice” wasn’t much like the Jewish model.

They typically killed an animal and spread its entrails out as a fortune-telling method. Not sure why you think the Mass resembles that at all. The point isn't what the Romans did. It's how they did it. Animal sacrifice was done outside their temples as that was messy, but their was a ritual that went with it that had to be done a certain way. Votive offerings were left inside the temple, which likely also had a ritual done as well. St. Paul expanded the early church throughout the Roman Empire to gentiles, and the church and its ceremonies would have become less Jewish and more Roman. I've never read of a Seder meal which required bells, but it's reasonable to assume that Roman pagan rituals used them. After Christianity became the official state religion of Rome, the statues of the old Roman gods were removed from their temples and replaced with altars and crosses. The Eastern rites of worship in the Catholic Church may be more influenced by Judaism, but the Roman Catholic mass is more Roman. 15 posted on 07/14/2025 8:51:19 AM PDT by Dr. Franklin ("A republic, if you can keep it." ) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 14 | View Replies] To: Campion The Romans weren't big into worshipping the "rising sun," so it seems like you're just grasping for something that sticks.

That is why Christmas is celebrated near the winter solstice, when the German sun god returned and the days grew longer again. 16 posted on 07/14/2025 8:54:47 AM PDT by Dr. Franklin ("A republic, if you can keep it." ) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 13 | View Replies] To: Dr. Franklin I try not to comment on religious matters here ...Well you certainly don't seem to be doing that, are you?

Disguised as goodness, it makes promises that will not come.- It is an incredible way of speaking [by the German Synod] to define the sinful reality of lived sexuality - adultery, promiscuity, etc - as a source of revelation.- In the Corona era, it could be observed that the Church was a servant of the state at the expense of her faith. The Church is always threatened by embracing the world and political forces. This can be seen with taxes in German-speaking countries and sinicisation in China.- If the Church no longer believes and the thinking of bishops and Christians becomes secularised, then the Church becomes an NGO and a social institute, but not a sacrament of salvation. It then proclaims psychology, but not the supernatural presence of God.- The Church should not get involved in the dialog of contradictory scientific opinions - for example on climate change - and become an advocate for agendas, for example from the UN.- If politicians have enough power and money, they can get away with any injustice. This happens on a grand scale. Christine Lagarde, President of the European Central Bank, has burned huge sums of tax money and is not punished because of her “special personality”. Marine Le Pen wouldn’t get away with embezzlement. I don't want to rate that, I just see the different standards.- The principle of subsidiarity would prevent a concentration of power at the highest level, which could then tyrannize and dominate the masses. A country like Switzerland can decide what is good locally better than politicians in faraway Brussels.- Overall, I am an opponent of globalism and global structures. You can't govern so many people in a drop-down system. To keep this under control, you have to install more and more mechanisms that manipulate the masses, keep them in line and take away their freedom.- Attempts have been made - and this is perhaps still topical - to strive for a new world order. The elites also organize among themselves, the Bilderberg Conference or the World Economic Forum. These are exchange platforms where those who really have power and a lot of money can come together and establish a program, a strategy. Democratic control is needed here.- There is a concentration of power in a few hands, for example in asset managers such as BlackRock, whose budgets exceed the gross national product of entire countries. These are bodies without political control. They can decide autonomously.- The national parliaments and politicians are actually just shadowy figures of the donors in the background, who can no longer really make autonomous decisions.- Many images of the Apocalypse - such as animals with many heads and horns or the sign to buy and sell - play out before our eyes.- Ideologies - such as the gender ideology - are deconstructive. This not only affects the old social order, but also leads to the deconstruction of truth and reason. There is then no longer even a truth about human nature. Everything becomes the arbitrariness of feelings or interests. This can then be enforced by law.- Ideologies begin with the redefinition of language. The core of the matter is removed and only the shell is left. People talk about democracy, but there is no longer any democracy inside. You can say it's a democracy promotion law, but it's actually censorship. The protection of the narrative propagated by the state is referred to as the protection of democracy, as protection against fake news. That is the end of freedom of speech.- Theologians are the most refined sophists. And bishops have also mastered this art of speech, of saying something and nothing at the same time.- I started as an altar boy in the old rite and then retrained.

I am only now beginning to reflect on these things retrospectively: Why have these beautiful texts - such as the prayers at the Foot of the Altar or at the offertory - been canceled at the desk? These prayers also help the priest who is celebrating.- I learned the old rite because a priest from the Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter asked me to do a confirmation. He has a very lively congregation with families and young people.- It is a time-honored liturgy that has been celebrated for almost 2000 years. We have around 24 rites in the Church. Why the marginalization or polemic of the faithful who love this rite?- I have wondered why the Second Vatican Council did not bring about a flowering of Faith. Paul VI already lamented this: Why was there not a renewal, but such a loss of Faith?- If you look at France, there were over 19,000 pilgrims on the pilgrimage from Paris to Chartres at Pentecost 2025 and the average age was 20. That's a generation that doesn't even know the texts of the Council. And I don't want to ask who among them has ever read an entire council text, for example Dei Verbum.- The old liturgy is very theocentric, Christocentric and the priest therefore has the central role. In the new liturgy, the danger is that the priest, who looks at the people, becomes almost like a moderator.- In the Novus Ordo, Christ's death on the cross, is overwritten by different themes. At First Communion, the rainbow is suddenly the theme. Or there is a crawling liturgy for toddlers, or a women's liturgy.

It's how they did it. Animal sacrifice was done outside their temples as that was messy, but their was a ritual that went with it that had to be done a certain way. Votive offerings were left inside the temple, which likely also had a ritual done as well. St. Paul expanded the early church throughout the Roman Empire to gentiles, and the church and its ceremonies would have become less Jewish and more Roman. I've never read of a Seder meal which required bells, but it's reasonable to assume that Roman pagan rituals used them. After Christianity became the official state religion of Rome, the statues of the old Roman gods were removed from their temples and replaced with altars and crosses. The Eastern rites of worship in the Catholic Church may be more influenced by Judaism, but the Roman Catholic mass is more Roman. 15 posted on 07/14/2025 8:51:19 AM PDT by Dr. Franklin ("A republic, if you can keep it." ) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 14 | View Replies] To: Campion The Romans weren't big into worshipping the "rising sun," so it seems like you're just grasping for something that sticks.

Here are the main points. Full German video below.- In the Middle Ages, a Christian cosmos centred on the cathedral developed, incorporating also schools and charitable institutions. This has largely been destroyed since the Enlightenment. All godless substitute empires, such as communism and National Socialism, have failed. Now, transhumanism is attempting to recreate the human being independently of God.- There are destructive forces at work. If you look closely, you will see that they are always directed against Christianity, or more precisely, against the Catholic Church. This is supernatural. The Church has a divine origin, with the Son of God living within it in a mysterious way. The demonic, evil, anti-Christian spirit creates a counter-realm and targets Christ, its arch-enemy.- Anti-Christian forces are forming unholy alliances, for example between left-wing fascism and Islam. This enemy takes on different guises, using lies and deception, and will stop at nothing. Disguised as goodness, it makes promises that will not come.- It is an incredible way of speaking [by the German Synod] to define the sinful reality of lived sexuality - adultery, promiscuity, etc - as a source of revelation.- In the Corona era, it could be observed that the Church was a servant of the state at the expense of her faith. The Church is always threatened by embracing the world and political forces. This can be seen with taxes in German-speaking countries and sinicisation in China.- If the Church no longer believes and the thinking of bishops and Christians becomes secularised, then the Church becomes an NGO and a social institute, but not a sacrament of salvation. It then proclaims psychology, but not the supernatural presence of God.- The Church should not get involved in the dialog of contradictory scientific opinions - for example on climate change - and become an advocate for agendas, for example from the UN.- If politicians have enough power and money, they can get away with any injustice. This happens on a grand scale. Christine Lagarde, President of the European Central Bank, has burned huge sums of tax money and is not punished because of her “special personality”. Marine Le Pen wouldn’t get away with embezzlement. I don't want to rate that, I just see the different standards.- The principle of subsidiarity would prevent a concentration of power at the highest level, which could then tyrannize and dominate the masses. A country like Switzerland can decide what is good locally better than politicians in faraway Brussels.- Overall, I am an opponent of globalism and global structures. You can't govern so many people in a drop-down system. To keep this under control, you have to install more and more mechanisms that manipulate the masses, keep them in line and take away their freedom.- Attempts have been made - and this is perhaps still topical - to strive for a new world order. The elites also organize among themselves, the Bilderberg Conference or the World Economic Forum. These are exchange platforms where those who really have power and a lot of money can come together and establish a program, a strategy. Democratic control is needed here.- There is a concentration of power in a few hands, for example in asset managers such as BlackRock, whose budgets exceed the gross national product of entire countries. These are bodies without political control. They can decide autonomously.- The national parliaments and politicians are actually just shadowy figures of the donors in the background, who can no longer really make autonomous decisions.- Many images of the Apocalypse - such as animals with many heads and horns or the sign to buy and sell - play out before our eyes.- Ideologies - such as the gender ideology - are deconstructive. This not only affects the old social order, but also leads to the deconstruction of truth and reason. There is then no longer even a truth about human nature. Everything becomes the arbitrariness of feelings or interests. This can then be enforced by law.- Ideologies begin with the redefinition of language. The core of the matter is removed and only the shell is left. People talk about democracy, but there is no longer any democracy inside. You can say it's a democracy promotion law, but it's actually censorship. The protection of the narrative propagated by the state is referred to as the protection of democracy, as protection against fake news. That is the end of freedom of speech.- Theologians are the most refined sophists. And bishops have also mastered this art of speech, of saying something and nothing at the same time.- I started as an altar boy in the old rite and then retrained.

They typically killed an animal and spread its entrails out as a fortune-telling method. Not sure why you think the Mass resembles that at all. The point isn't what the Romans did. It's how they did it. Animal sacrifice was done outside their temples as that was messy, but their was a ritual that went with it that had to be done a certain way. Votive offerings were left inside the temple, which likely also had a ritual done as well. St. Paul expanded the early church throughout the Roman Empire to gentiles, and the church and its ceremonies would have become less Jewish and more Roman. I've never read of a Seder meal which required bells, but it's reasonable to assume that Roman pagan rituals used them. After Christianity became the official state religion of Rome, the statues of the old Roman gods were removed from their temples and replaced with altars and crosses. The Eastern rites of worship in the Catholic Church may be more influenced by Judaism, but the Roman Catholic mass is more Roman. 15 posted on 07/14/2025 8:51:19 AM PDT by Dr. Franklin ("A republic, if you can keep it." ) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 14 | View Replies] To: Campion The Romans weren't big into worshipping the "rising sun," so it seems like you're just grasping for something that sticks.

Share (FOX 9) - Allete, the parent company of Minnesota Power, says the Minnesota Department of Commerce is now backing the company's sale to investment firm BlackRock and the Canadian pension fund after a recent agreement. The backstory: Allete announced last year it had entered into an agreement to be acquired by a partnership between the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Global Infrastructure Partners, a division of BlackRock. Allete is the parent company of Minnesota Power, the electric company that serves parts of central and northeast Minnesota, including Duluth. Allete also owns Superior Light and Power in Wisconsin. What we know: In an announcement last week, Allete said it had reached an agreement with the Minnesota Department of Commerce to gain support for the acquisition. Under the agreement, Allete says Minnesota Power would commit to a one-year base rate freeze and lower its return on equity from 9.78% to 9.65%. The agreement also requires: Dig deeper: Allete says the recent agreement follows another set of commitments made by the future owners, including honoring union contracts, maintaining the current workforce and compensation levels, keeping the company headquarters in Duluth, and retaining the current management team. The investment funds also agreed to contribute $3.5 million to forgive bills owed by low-income customers. What's next: The deal needs approval from the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. Allete expects to close on the deal in 2025. Other regulatory bodies, including the Wisconsin Public Service Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, have signed off on the deal.

Title: Bitcoin Bulls Target $120,000 — $1.5B Shorts on the Line

As Bitcoin’s all-time high (ATH) rollercoaster ride continues, the top cryptocurrency might be eyeing the psychological price of $120,000 based on the number of shorts expected to be liquidated at this level. Calling out this development, market analyst Crypto Joe stated, “$1.5 billion worth of BTC shorts are set to be liquidated if BTC hits $120,000.” What does this mean? Well, if Bitcoin hits $120,000, over $1.5 billion in short positions risk liquidation, forcing bearish traders to buy back at higher prices and potentially fueling further upside. Liquidations accelerate rallies because forced short closures trigger buybacks, adding buying pressure that drives Bitcoin’s price even higher. Based on the $1.5 billion worth of BTC shorts, the leading cryptocurrency might be eyeing strong bullish momentum because widespread short liquidations reveal misplaced bearish bets and set the stage for a powerful short squeeze. Bitcoin is not relenting on its quest to scale heights after recently hitting historic highs of $112,000, thanks to BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recording net inflows of $50 billion. The leading cryptocurrency’s present ATH stands at $118,351 per CoinMarketCap data. Bitcoin’s breakout above $118,000 is being fueled by bullish macro trends, rising institutional demand, and strengthening on-chain fundamentals. The launch of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs unlocked billions in institutional capital, with giants like BlackRock and Fidelity driving aggressive BTC accumulation with daily inflows now surpassing new supply. Institutional adoption for Bitcoin as a treasury asset is also going through the roof, further igniting BTC’s fire. Therefore, Bitcoin might continue making new ATHs, as evidenced by the huge liquidation expected at the $120,000, which is bullish based on technical analysis.

Title: Promoting the Perps

by Mark Steyn The Trump Rally, One Year On July 13, 2025 https://www.steynonline.com/15442/promoting-perps Today is the first anniversary of the shooting of the Republican presidential candidate while on stage in Butler, Pennsylvania. Once it became clear that the hit had not succeeded, the awful corrupt American media lost all interest in the story, which remains the most under-investigated presidential assassination attempt of the last hundred years. Curious. Here is the column I wrote a year ago with a few annotations twelve months on: Let's cut to the chase - the US Secret Service: In on it? Or just totally crap? To get that out of the way: At the bare minimum, the Secret Service are guilty of what certain jurisdictions call culpable negligence. Having been informed of both foreign and domestic threats against Donald Trump, they created conditions that greatly assisted anyone wishing to take a shot at the President to do so. As I said, that's the "bare minimum"; I happen to think what was going on high up in the SS bureaucracy was rather more than that. Well, I've thought the Secret Service were rubbish not just since we learned of the Cartagena hookers but for at least another decade before that. And increasingly, when it comes to American officialdom - from Kabul to Uvalde - to modify Henry Ford, you can get it in any colour as long as it's bloated, lavishly over-funded and entirely dysfunctional. And yet and yet... it's hard to believe even these guys (plus their bevy of five-foot-two-eyes-of-blue Keystone chorus girls) could be this crap. Assuming for the purposes of argument that the body on the roof is actually that of the perp, a goofball barely out of high school hatched a plan to have Donald Trump's head explode in close-up on live TV - and, wittingly or otherwise, the world's most flush money-no-object security state did their best to help him pull it off. The goofball in question - Thomas Crooks - was not a high functioning individual. Yet he knew enough to, inter alia, use sophisticated encryption services to veil some of his Internet use. Other than that, and the fact that he had rather bad body odour, we know as little about him as we did twenty-four hours after his shooting of the President. Odd. We do know, however, that young Master Crooks's presence on site had been known to the Secret Service for ninety minutes before he put a bullet in Trump's ear. We know too that the Trump detail requested additional "counter-drone equipment" for the Butler rally. This was denied by Washington. So they had to make do with their existing "limited" counter-drone equipment, operated by a "severely inexperienced" agent with only an hour's training on it. And of course, come the big day, the "limited" counter-drone equipment malfunctioned. So it was taken off for repairs, and thus the "severely inexperienced" agent failed to detect the would-be assassin's drone flying over the site for hours beforehand. Does this sound remotely credible even for the crap-arse Government of the United States? The high-school goofball's drone works ...but the Secret Service's doesn't. In any accountable 'public service', the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secret Service gal would already be gone. By this point after the Argentine invasion of the Falklands, Lord Carrington (Foreign Secretary), Sir Humphrey Atkins (Lord Privy Seal) and Richard Luce (Minister for Latin-American Affairs) had already resigned: see my column of September 17th 2001 expressing in my naïve Canadian way mystification as to why, six days later, all the 9/11 flopperoos had not been similarly dispatched. Because that's how it goes in the Republic of Non-Accountability, and, if he's harbouring any doubts about his fitness for the job, Mayorkas figures it can wait till someone takes out RFK Jr. This is a depraved political culture. Au contraire, we have learned in recent days that there is accountability: why, no fewer than six SS employees have been suspended without pay! Per Susan Crabtree at RealClearPolitics (one of the few reporters to take any real interest in the matter), the half-dozen agents deemed to have "under-performed" that day were originally supposed to be suspended without pay for three to six months. That was subsequently "dialled back" to fifty-two days without pay, which was then further dialled back to ten to forty-two days. Compare and contrast with some hapless gran'ma wandering around the Capitol on J6. And, higher up the chain, nobody's been hit with ten-day suspensions; instead, they've been promoted. Nick Menster, for example, who "supervised" the final walk-throughs on the big day, is now the Number Two on the protective detail of Lara and Eric Trump. If I were Mr and Mrs Trump, I wouldn't allow him anywhere near me. If you're wondering why the government is rubbish at almost everything it tries to do, the Republic of Non-Accountability is a big part of the problem. Aside from the Cartagena-hooker budget, in the end they're just federal bureaucrats like all the others. What's the old line? When seconds count, the police are minutes away? Not at a Secret Service event: even when the police are on site in massive overwhelming numbers, they're still minutes away. Here are fifty-two seconds of members of the public yelling that "he's on the roof": NEW - Trump Assassin video shows him crawling on the roof while multiple people point him out to police They yelled about him for *almost an entire minute* It's insane how Secret Service allowed this amateur to almost kill Trump pic.twitter.com/CWfHBGzOCp Where are all the cool guys with the reflector shades and dangling telephone cords? Or even the club-footed pint-size Keystone Rockettes? Under Mayorkas, have all the Cartagena hookers moved to Butler, Pennsylvania? But it gets better (at least for those who want Orange Hitler dead). From the Associated Press: 'Not long before shots rang out, rallygoers noticed a man climbing to the roof of a nearby building and warned local police, according to two law enforcement officials. 'One local police officer climbed to the roof and encountered Crooks, who pointed his rifle at the officer. The officer retreated down the ladder, and Crooks quickly took a shot toward Trump...' Uh-huh. Actually, over half-a-dozen shots - hitting the target, killing retired fire chief Corey Comperatore, and gravely wounding two others. As I noted yesterday: 'Thomas Matthew Crooks took his AR-15 to a political rally. And the reason he was permitted to do so is because he was 'outside the security perimeter' ...yet still within range of the candidate's head. 'Does that make sense even by the arseholian standards of the federal government?' No. Even in rinky-dink no-account third-rate basket-cases, it's understood that the first job of a protection detail is to establish where the lines of fire are, and neutralise them. Can the failure to do that really be accidental? Yet from the decision to demarcate the easily accessible rooftop as 'outside the security perimeter' all else follows. Once it was determined by the Secret Service that the building with the spiffy line of sight was beyond their purview it ceased to be of any interest to them. So that fell to local law enforcement - and a village constable shinning up the ladder. Here, for example, is an ex-Secret Service guy absolving his old comrades from responsibility for what happened: 'So in summary, when looking for blame in this massive security failure, if I was a betting man, I'd say the answer rests with whatever detail (likely local LEOs) were assigned to the area near the outbuildings.' That guy's"expert" take gets more stupid every time I read it. Here's my instant reaction from last July: Wait a minute. The only reason the Secret Service was in Butler, Pennsylvania was to take a bullet for the forty-fifth president. If the Secret Service chooses to 'assign' part of that responsibility to others by shrinking its perimeter, that's on you. The telephone-cord A-listers subsequently bragged that they were the guys who took out Mr Crooks, albeit after his month's supply of ammo had run out. But, given the comprehensiveness of federal failing, I'm more inclined to believe the word of village constable sergeant Aaron Zaliponi of the Adams Township Police Department, who says he fired and hit Crooks's rifle, preventing him from blowing apart Trump's skull. To answer that prat above, it was the "LEOs" who did the job they shouldn't have been assigned in the first place: Oh, but why are they shrinking the perimeter anyway? From RealClearPolitics White House correspondent Susan Crabtree: 'Secret Services resources were diverted to Jill Biden's event and away from Trump's because they followed agency protocol applying to Trump as a former president, according to two sources within the Secret Service community... 'Who made the decision to divert the resources to Jill Biden's event?' 'Agency protocol': So Trump, who's the first 'defeated' incumbent to run again since Grover Cleveland, is being treated like any old 'former president' - like Jimmy Carter back in Plains, say. Because 'agency protocol' is so inflexible that's just how it is. On the other hand, Dr Jill is being bulked up and treated as the candidate, which, given that Joe's back in Delaware watching Matlock and eating tapioca, she might as well be. So, if the 'resources' are being 'diverted' elsewhere, the Secret Service can do one of two things: a) Its job, and attempt to rise to the occasion; or b) Shrink the perimeter, and assign the space to the Keystone cops. Like I say: In on it? Or Zen levels of total crapness? An alternative take from Mann vs Steyn defence witness Stephen McIntyre: who remembers the novel and film The Day of the Jackal? Compare portrayal of diligent law enforcement 50 years ago to Biden administration excuse that roof 150 yards was "outside the designated perimeter" and thus ignored by Secret Service. And the local policeman who approached... https://t.co/xauKB6Oiy7 Ah, but The Day of the Jackal is set in France. And in France, as in most countries, the only police are 'the police' - in the Jackal's day, a Gendarmerie nationale and a Sûreté that both report to the same national government. In America, 'the police' are many and various - federal, state, county, municipal: see any old press conference after any old mass-shooting with representatives of thirty-seven different law-enforcement agencies huddled behind the mike stand like a clown car shooting for the Guinness Book of Records. After that, the usual snobbery kicks in: once a building's been sloughed off on the local lads, no Secret Service types will give it another thought. So it was left to the rally's attendees to notice there was a gunman climbing to the roof, and they did their civic duty and brought it to the attention of 'the police'. But what's the policeman whose attention they brought it to supposed to do? Speak to the Secret Service guys on the stage with Trump through those super-cool earpieces and let them know they need to hustle the candidate away? Er, no. He's the village constable, so he's too déclassé to have access to the federal earpiece crowd. Set aside the Uvalde better-part-of-valour retreat back down the ladder ...except to consider how long it would take. Like I said, when seconds count, the money-no-object Secret Service are minutes of cumbersome local/federal liaison away. Like I also said, in any functioning public service Mayorkas and the Pepsi gal would already be gone. In on it? Or just crap beyond belief? Everything that's emerged in the last twenty-four hours takes me back - twenty years, to the 2004 campaign, when the then First Lady, Laura Bush, came to New Hampshire to do an event at the Lebanon Opera House. For the benefit of non-American readers, I should explain that this is not an opera house in the sense of La Scala or Covent Garden. It's a municipal government office with a modest auditorium on the upper floor. Come the big day, the Secret Service lads were everywhere ...yet they left the Lebanon Clerk's office in the basement wide-open. When the New Hampshire lady organising the event notified the agents of 'this obvious problem', she was told that 'advance' had covered it. So out front there was the usual chaos, with Granite Staters backed up down the street waiting to shuffle through the metal detectors. But, if you just walked round the back of the building, you could enter through the open and unguarded door of the clerk's office and take the open and unguarded elevator up to the floor of the event, where the door opened on the other side of the Secret Service screening process. So anyone could access the 'secure' area unimpeded. Because the clerk's office had been determined to be 'beyond the perimeter'. The New Hampshire organiser was not happy about this, and, after surveying the scene, rustled up a couple of off-duty Granite State copper types she recognised on the street to guard the elevator at both ends. Bonus insight into cumbersome yet ineffectual federal security theatre: 'We dutifully collected hundreds of social security numbers from attendees in advance for 'background checks' only to learn they didn't actually run them ("not enough time").' I have never taken the Secret Service seriously since. So I am not surprised to learn that a fellow can take an AR-15 to a Trump campaign event without going through security and climb up the roof to a position with a clear line of sight to the target's head - and that, even as multiple members of the public point this out, the minutes tick by. So to come back to my opening question: Just the usual crapness augmented by a bit of good luck on the would-be assassin's part? Or something worse? On Saturday, America came within an inch and a second of crossing a very dark Rubicon. As Trump reveals to Michael Goodwin in The New York Post: 'The doctor at the local hospital, which has a trauma center, told him he's never seen anyone survive getting hit by an AR-15.' Indeed. Because that's what just happened. In 1981 Reagan was hit by a revolver; forty-three years of ever more extravagant security protocols later, a loser whose greatest accomplishment was a cameo in a BlackRock ad was able to hit the head of a president with his AR-15. And this startling fact is of less concern to a corrupted American media than the fact that a few 'loud bangs' at a Trump rally might provoke, ooh, a violent backlash from the crazy Maga types... There will be more to come in the ensuing months. Because, as Joe Biden correctly emphasises, in America we resolve our differences at the battle box: Biden: "We resolve our differences at the battle box. That is how you do it. At the BATTLE box." pic.twitter.com/Z82PuMVrro No joke! ~We thank you for all your support these last twenty-three years - and thank you especially to all those new members of The Mark Steyn Club, and those old members who've signed up a chum for a SteynOnline Gift Certificate or a Steyn Club Gift Membership.

Title: Second Quarter Earnings Season Preview

Time Published: 2025-07-13T12:23:53Z

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. The second-quarter earnings season begins this week, with 39 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. ... More This week has a heavy emphasis on banks including: JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), Citigroup (C), Bank of America (BAC), and Goldman Sachs (GS) (AP Photo/File) The second-quarter earnings season begins this week. 39 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report, with a heavy emphasis on the large banks. Notable companies scheduled to release earnings include: Blackrock (BLK), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), Citigroup (C), Bank of America (BAC), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Goldman Sachs (GS), PepsiCo (PEP), Netflix (NFLX), 3M (MMM), and American Express (AXP). With only a few companies reporting and combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the S&P 500’s blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at 4.8% year-over-year, slightly below the expectations at the end of the quarter. Notably, the calendar year 2025 expected earnings growth rate is 9.0% and 2026’s expectations are at 14.0%. S&P 500 Earnings Estimate Summary Tariff worries led to a slight decline in the S&P 500 last week. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed last week. Market Performance Because these companies are critical drivers of earnings growth, a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, and are currently in a bear market, the Magnificent 7 remains the group to watch this earnings season. The first of the Magnificent 7 is scheduled to report results next week. Magnificent 7: Q2 Estimated Earnings Growth According to FactSet data, the earnings expectations for the financial sector are deceptively low due to JPMorgan Chase (JPM). JPM reported a significant gain from sales of Visa (V) stock in the same quarter last year, so the company has challenging year-over-year comparisons. If JPM is excluded from the financial sector, year-over-year earnings growth improves to 9.3% from 2.4%. Earnings Growth Estimates By Sector On the other side of the ledger, earnings growth rate expectations within the communication services sector are being flattered by Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD). According to FactSet, WBD reported a significant loss last year due to a goodwill impairment charge, so it is benefiting from extremely easy comparisons. If WBD is excluded, the expected growth of the communication services sector falls from 29.4% year-over-year to 8.2%. The energy sector is predicted to show the most significant decline in year-over-year earnings due to lower oil prices. Energy Commodities Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. If the estimates of second quarter nominal year-over-year GDP growth of 4.7% are correct, there could be some upside to sales growth. At this early point in the earnings season, sales growth at 4.2% is meeting expectations. GDP Growth Fuels S&P 500 Sales Consistent with the earnings picture, revenues in the energy sector should see the most significant year-over-year decline. Estimated Sales Growth By Sector The US dollar weakened relative to the same quarter last year. On the margin, this should benefit companies’ international earnings. According to FactSet, 41% of S&P 500 sales are from international sources. US Dollar The economic calendar also heats up this week with consumer inflation (CPI) and retail sales. Tuesday’s June CPI is expected to be hotter, increasing to 2.6% year-over-year from 2.4%. The Federal Reserve already expects some inflation impact from tariffs and is likely on the sidelines until at least September. The retail sales report on Thursday is expected to show a modest rebound for the US consumer. Since consumers are a crucial driver of the US economy, this rebound will be essential for economic growth expectations. Newsflow about the administration’s trade negotiations and new tariff announcements will remain a focus. Significant new tariffs are currently scheduled to be implemented on August 1, barring an acceptable trade agreement. With financials dominating the first week of earnings season, the headline earnings should begin on a positive note. With the tariff overhang and consensus expecting an acceleration in earnings growth for the third quarter, forward earnings guidance from management will be watched closely.

Title: Bitcoin gains ground in gold vs. crypto debate

Lyn Alden and Vijay Boyapati urge gold maximalists to hedge risk by allocating 5% of their metals portfolio to Bitcoin. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. When gold maximalist Debra Robinson jeered, “Imagine paying $118k for a set of man-made numbers,” she echoed a familiar skepticism among precious metal enthusiasts. Lyn Alden, a respected macro analyst and Bitcoin bull, responded with pragmatic advice: “Precious metal enthusiasts could buy a bitcoin position of like 5% of their metals position. That hedges their risk of bitcoin gradually taking market share, so they can go to the beach and forget about the asset forever. Plenty of folks have recommended that for years.” As of the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at just under $118,000, having recently hit new all-time highs, reflecting global economic uncertainty and inflation concerns. The “set of man-made numbers” now has a market capitalization that exceeds $2.2 trillion, putting it ahead of silver and making it one of the world’s most valuable assets, and 100 public companies, including BlackRock and Strategy, collectively hold nearly 1.3 million BTC, about 6% of the total supply. In fairness to Debra, gold has also favored well of late, trading close to its record high of just over $3,500 at $3,355 an ounce. However, Alden’s 5% allocation suggestion is not about abandoning gold, but about risk management. For a gold holder with $100,000 in metals, a $5,000 position in Bitcoin acts as a hedge against the risk that Bitcoin continues to eat into gold’s traditional role as a store of value. This small allocation to Bitcoin can provide upside exposure if Bitcoin continues to outperform; even a modest position can have a significant impact on total portfolio returns. If Bitcoin fails, as many gold maximalists absolutely believe it will, the loss is limited to a small fraction of the overall portfolio. As Alden puts it: “They can go to the beach and forget about the asset forever.” Vijay Boyapati, author of The Bullish Case for Bitcoin, offered a historical perspective. He commented: “I was recommending this in 2013. At that time, I viewed Bitcoin as insurance against gold. Now I view gold as insurance against Bitcoin.” Boyapati’s comment reflects the dramatic shift in Bitcoin’s perceived risk profile over the last decade. What was once a speculative hedge for gold bugs has, for many, become the main event, with gold now playing the supporting role. Not everyone is convinced, however. CryptoSlate reported on the ongoing debate over gold vs Bitcoin yesterday, when notorious Bitcoin skeptic Peter Schiff came out to criticize the number-one crypto asset once more. Despite Bitcoin’s new highs, Schiff recently urged investors to sell BTC and buy silver, arguing that: “Bitcoin remains a risky bet, while silver offers more upside and minimal downside.” Yet, as corporate and institutional adoption of Bitcoin accelerates, Schiff’s warnings increasingly fall on deaf ears. Allocating even a small percentage of a metals portfolio to Bitcoin is a rational hedge against being blindsided by technological change, and as Boyapati stated, the logic of hedging with Bitcoin has only grown stronger as adoption, liquidity, and institutional interest have surged. Gold maximalists may scoff at the idea of paying six figures for man-made numbers, but the numbers don’t lie: Bitcoin’s rise is reshaping the store-of-value landscape. As Lyn Alden and Vijay Boyapati suggest, a modest Bitcoin allocation is not just speculation, it’s prudent risk management in a rapidly evolving world.

Title: Dave Fanning: ‘I felt very sorry for Ryan Tubridy, he was vilified’

Dave Fanning has a man bag. It’s a battered brown leather satchel full of notebooks containing playlists and ideas for programmes, the notes written neatly in longhand. “Old school,” he says. We’re in The Mercantile Hotel on Dame Street sipping a latte and when I ask how he’s doing he says “Ah, sure, you know yourself, I’m working in RTÉ – have you heard about it lately?” He very much wants to keep working there – “I love what I do” – so he’s careful about what he says about the broadcaster. “I mean sometimes you have to say something, I’ve done that a few times over the years and there’s one or two things I wish I hadn’t said, but such is life.” We’ll come back to some foot-in-mouth moments later but for now we’re interrupted by a middle-aged man at the next table. “I recognised your voice,” he tells Fanning. “It was a pleasure growing up with you.” This kind of thing happens to him a lot. Turning 70 next February, he has been playing music for audiences since the late-1970s. “People say they grew up with me but they’d no f**king choice, it was 1980s Ireland; it’s like when there was a really bad movie on a plane, you had to watch it,” he says. He makes the point that when he started playing records on RTÉ there wasn’t much else going on. “I mean we weren’t bad, I’ll say that, but we were only doing what Joe Bloggs would have done, playing records. Like, it wasn’t science – we were just lucky to be the ones doing it.” And he’s still doing it, nearly 50 years later, which is something he doesn’t take for granted. He finds it hilarious that for the next few weeks there’s a Dave Fanning show on seven days a week on RTÉ radio. He breaks it down. There’s his RTÉ Gold show from 6pm to 8pm Monday to Friday. On Saturday, he has a show that is his take on music through the decades. (He gives 16 hours to each decade so that one will go on for a while.) Then on Sundays, for the next several weeks, he has an hour in the evening where 24 Irish bands or artists will pick one favourite album and discuss it. “So that’s me, seven days a week for the next while,” he says with a laugh. The other programmes are more chatty but his Monday-to-Friday gig, Dave Fanning on RTÉ Gold, is just about the music. Across the two-hour programme you’ll hear his voice, and he’s timed it, for a mere five minutes. “There’s no news, there’s no sport, there’s no ads, there’s no demo tapes, there’s no weather,” he says. Here’s his pitch to listeners, who he is well aware are a specific demographic. “I’m saying to people, listen, you know that record collection you have at home, the one you are going to buy a new turntable for? You’re never going to buy a new turntable, with all due respect, blokes, and anyway your wife has put your record collection in the attic. Or in the skip.” If this resonates, Fanning’s message to you is: “Worry not. I’ll play your record collection for you. I’ll play the music you like and I’ll shut the f**k up.” At this point, another person approaches, a younger man this time. He wants Fanning’s advice about whether he should go to see Paul Weller or Van Morrison play live this summer. Fanning gives him a five-minute answer but the short version is “Paul Weller, because Van Morrison is hit and miss and 80 per cent of the time he’s a miss”. [ From the archive: Dave Fanning moving on from 2FM after 44 yearsOpens in new window ] He describes himself as a music veteran from an early age thanks to the record collections and excellent taste of his older siblings. The youngest of six growing up in south Co Dublin – “well, my mother would say youngest of seven; one brother, Brian, died at the age of nine months”. Fanning had an “idyllic” childhood and went to Blackrock College. A fully paid-up member of the official Beatles fan club since he was eight, at 11 he went to his local record shop and put a “10 bob note down as a deposit on the Beatles’ new album which wasn’t due out for six months”. Fanning remembers the record shop assistant asking him what it was called. “It’s called Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band,” 11-year-old Fanning declared. He’d read about the album in his brother’s NME magazine. The publication was on order in the Fanning family’s local shop for six decades. While he went on to train to be a teacher in UCD, his musical education continued in the college’s Theatre L where he saw everyone from Paul Brady to Thin Lizzy. Then there was an ad on the back of The Irish Times, “editor wanted for Scene Magazine”. His mother saw it and said “give it a bash”, while friends encouraged him. He got the job. While working there he was also with pirate station Big D Radio and DJing three nights a week in McGonagles. That’s when his relationship with U2 began. He’d play them more than any other band “because they were good but they also had more demos than anyone else”. In 1979, RTÉ decided they had better start a pop station to target younger listeners and RTÉ Radio 2, now 2FM, was born. Until then people were “listening to Radio Luxembourg with the radio out the window but they didn’t have to do that any more because we were playing the music”. I think about that 11-year-old putting down a deposit for the new Beatles album. Could he believe playing records was his actual job? “I can hardly believe it now,” he says. “There are people who say ‘never make your hobby your job’. F**k that.” U2 were the first unsigned band to record one of his Fanning Sessions where up-and-coming bands were paid to come and record songs. “Public service broadcasting at its finest,” Fanning says. This was the start of the tradition where the band let Fanning be the first DJ in the world to play their new releases. He was considered a “good luck charm” by the band’s former manager Paul McGuinness. He still gets invited around to Bono’s house for a listening party every time there’s a new album. Why does he think Bono gets such a hard time from some? “He wears his heart on his sleeve and some people don’t like that.” The other obsession that he managed to turn into a profession is cinema. He has presented film shows for decades and for the past 40 years he has watched a minimum of a movie a night. His wife Ursula is about to go away with friends and this means he will probably watch two. Hitchcock’s Psycho is a favourite. He saw a list of top 100 movie stars in Empire recently. “I had interviewed 84 of them,” he marvels. He mentions Ursula, a solicitor, a lot. He says he wasn’t keen to settle down but that getting married “was the best decision that was ever made for me”. Fanning makes a living from talking but sometimes his mouth gets him into trouble. When Aslan’s Christy Dignam died, he made comments about the singer’s earlier heroin use which understandably angered and upset his family. He made a heartfelt apology at the time. He’s reluctant to get into it again, only saying: “Christy was brilliant, I loved him”. He got into trouble when the RTÉ payments scandal broke, tweeting: “I think we all need a distraction from that nonsensical Oireachtas Nuremberg trial … So listen to our Rory Gallagher special tonight.” He later apologised unreservedly, saying he did not mean to trivialise proceedings. He is friends with Ryan Tubridy, and they are both represented by Noel Kelly who was a central figure in the RTÉ scandal. He doesn’t get into the detail of the controversy but says “the way Ryan was treated was appalling. He was a scapegoat … he’s paid enough of a price and was hounded out of this country in many ways. I felt very sorry for Ryan, he was vilified.” Conceived in the pandemic, his Fanning At Whelan’s showcase for Irish music on Virgin Media is a sort of family cottage industry, with his wife, son and daughter involved in production. He’s never been staff at RTÉ which has allowed him work for other organisations and, crucially, being a contractor meant he did not have to retire at 65. He’s in good health? “Yes. And I think I look OK, but then you are out for a pint and you go for a pee and look at yourself in the mirror and think, who the f**k is that?” [ Dave Fanning missed the point about Aslan. Fans loved the fact that they were underdogsOpens in new window ] He still plays his records at home – the record collection is not in the attic – but he streams music too. Best new Irish act? “A. Smyth.” He hates how difficult it is for bands now, how financially impossible to hit the road and find an audience. “It’s terrible.” He gets wound up by injustice and follows US politics closely – he can rant for Ireland about the current state of affairs. He’s not a rap fan but on the Kneecap furore he says: “I can’t understand it. What’s wrong with saying you are against genocide?” Our lively Fanning session has lasted more than two hours. I could talk to him all day. If you are interested in music or film or whether Yoko Ono broke up the Beatles – “she definitely did” – time spent with Fanning is pure entertainment. He interviewed David Bowie five times. Paul McCartney six times. His enthusiasm and energy are impressive. He really can’t believe his luck, still getting to do what he does all day – seven days a week, in fact, for the next while. He throws his battered bag over his shoulder and heads off into the Dublin sunshine. “I never want to stop,” he says. “I mean, why would I?” Dave Fanning on RTÉ Gold runs Monday to Friday 6pm to 8pm Róisín Ingle is an Irish Times columnist, feature writer and coproducer of the Irish Times Women's Podcast © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

A woman who called into “The Ramsey Show” recently shared a shocking story about her in-laws, saying her 80-something-year-old mother-in-law had drained nearly $750,000 from a retirement account and given it to an internet scammer. Today's Best Finance Deals “My father-in-law went to the hospital about a year ago,” the caller said. “He decided to go ahead and give my mother-in-law access to her retirement account, thinking that he didn’t have much longer. She drained that within about a week, giving it to some online scammer.” Don't Miss: The caller said her in-laws had been married for 60 years and built up a nest egg of roughly $3.5 to $4 million. Her father-in-law had always managed the finances and kept them debt-free. But once his health started to decline, things unraveled. The woman said the family later discovered that her mother-in-law had been giving money away for years. They believe she is involved in delusional, one-sided online relationships, calling it a possible mental illness. “She’s involved in a one-way romantic relationship with this person she’s never met,” the caller said. “She’s got multiple Facebook profiles, same picture, different name, doing the same thing all over the country.” Despite being visited by the FBI and local police, the mother-in-law still believes her relationship is real. Trending: BlackRock is calling 2025 the year of alternative assets. One firm from NYC has quietly built a group of 60,000+ investors who have all joined in on an alt asset class previously exclusive to billionaires like Bezos and Gates. The caller expressed deep concern that her mother-in-law will blow through the rest of their joint assets after her father-in-law passes, potentially leaving the family on the hook for her care. “My husband and I—I’m in my late 40s, he’s in his mid-50s—we’re going to be debt-free in the next two years,” she said. “I don’t want to go into debt to take care of somebody else who… I don’t even like her like that.” John Delony and Jade Warshaw, who hosted the show that day, advised the caller that she and her husband had no legal or moral obligation to rescue someone who continued to make reckless choices. “There are times where you feel the need to swoop in… but those are choices,” Warshaw said. “It’s not your responsibility.” See Also: Many are surprised by Mark Cuban's advice for lotto winners: Cash or annuity? Delony recommended pursuing conservatorship through the courts, though he warned it would be difficult and possibly met with resistance. “You’re just throwing a Hail Mary pass, hoping somebody catches it,” he said. She’d have to prove she’s a harm to herself. The caller said her husband had talked to his father about giving financial power of attorney to one of the sons, but they have no proof that anything was filed. She suspects embarrassment is stopping him. “I think there’s a part of him that’s very embarrassed about this,” she said. “We’re just finding out about this, and it’s been going on to a certain degree for 60 years.” Delony emphasized the urgency. “Your husband and his brothers are faced with: Do we watch our mom burn her life to the ground, or do we go down swinging?” Read Next: Over the last five years, the price of gold has increased by approximately 83% — Investors like Bill O’Reilly and Rudy Giuliani are using this platform to create customized gold IRAs to help shield their savings from inflation and economic turbulence.

That's because volatility in the biggest and oldest digital coin is dampening, experts told Decrypt. And as the asset matures and sophisticated traders make more intelligent bets with Bitcoin, it's unlikely to boom as quickly as before. "Think of it like someone who's working out—a massive spike higher is like someone crash dieting to hit their weight goal, and then they just lose it three weeks later," Greg Magadini, Amberdata's director of derivatives, said. He added: "But a slow and steady grind higher is sustainable, unlike a massive, bubble-like rally. As Bitcoin grows in market cap, it takes more money to move it around." Bitcoin in previous cycles made sometimes absurd climbs. In 2017, for example, BTC rocketed to $19,345 in December, data provider CoinGecko shows, after starting the year at $786—a 2,360% surge. The flagship cryptocurrency's price hit a new high of $118,667 on Friday, up about 25% from the start of 2025 when it was trading at roughly $93,500. BTC's realized volatility is now 29.5%, far off 2021's 100%. The derivatives market indicates why. In 2021, the options market was considerably smaller, hitting a peak in October of that year of over $15 billion. In May, BTC open options contracts surged to over $42.5 billion on Deribit. Now traders are now buying Bitcoin via the new exchange-traded funds—approved last year—and using trading features on them. It works like this: investors with a lot of BTC are able to sell call options—contracts betting on the future price of an asset—adding liquidity to the market. Volatility decreases as sophisticated traders using this strategy sell options not expecting big price moves. Traders more widely than adjust their expectations and bets accordingly. "We see this with equities: When markets are bullish, they grind higher at a slower pace with less volatility," Magidini said. "With [BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust] we have a new class of market makers with deep pockets who can warehouse volatility bets easily," he added, noting that Bitcoin was a smaller asset class previously with smaller market makers. The asset is now attracting a more mature class of investor with institutional capital hitting the Bitcoin space, mainly through the new ETFs, market observers told Decrypt. Bitcoin spot ETFs pulled in $1.17 billion on Thursday, their second-biggest day since their debut in January 2024, led by BlackRock, Fidelity, and ARK Invest. On Friday, they remained strong, with about $1.03 billion worth of inflows. Still, Bitcoin's dramatic swings may not vanish completely. "I would definitely not rule out periods of high volatility," David Lawant, head of research at FalconX, told Decrypt, adding that price surges from now might "be locked into a tighter time period."

Who are anchor investors? Rahul: Anchor investors are a special class of institutional investors that SEBI introduced in 2009. They invest in IPOs one day before it opens to the public. Think of them as early movers who help build trust in the IPO. Nirmal: Oh! So, they get early access before everyone else? Rahul: They don’t just get in early, but they also invest big. Only qualified institutional buyers (QIBs) like mutual funds, insurance firms, pension funds, and foreign investors that can put in at least ₹10 crore qualify as anchor investors. Their presence can strongly influence pricing and create a buzz. For example, in the HDB IPO, top names like BlackRock, LIC, and Goldman Sachs came in as anchors that boost confidence for others. Nirmal: How does this affect me as a retail investor? Rahul: When big institutions back an IPO, it signals quality. Also, SEBI mandates that 35 per cent of the IPO is reserved for retail investors, 15 per cent for HNIs or non-institutional investors (NIIs), and up to 50 per cent for QIBs. Anchor portion includes up to 60 per cent of the QIBs’ portion. Anchor investors bid and get their shares allotted a day before the IPO opens for public subscription. But they can’t sell those shares immediately. Nirmal: Why not? Rahul: SEBI imposes a lock-in period; 50 per cent of the shares they get are locked for 30 days and the remaining 50 per cent for 90 days from the date of allotment. This prevents them from dumping the stock right after listing, which could tank the price. Nirmal: That makes sense. Keeps the IPO price stable after listing. Rahul: Exactly. Without the lock-in, prices could be very volatile post listing. Anchor investors are expected to be serious and long-term participants. Nirmal: And you said they play a role in price discovery too? Rahul: Yes. Because they put large sums into the IPO, their valuation acts as a benchmark. Nirmal: But have they ever gone wrong? Rahul: Good question. Not every IPO with anchor participation is a winner. Paytm, LIC, and SBI Cards had strong anchor backing but struggled on listing. Also, some SME IPOs like Wagons Learning failed due to poor anchor and public interest. Nirmal: Then why should I care about them? Rahul: Because unlike analyst reports or hype videos, anchor investors actually buy the shares. If serious institutions stay away, it might be a red flag. They help validate or question the company’s valuation. Nirmal: So, the anchor response tells me how trustworthy or overpriced an IPO might be? Rahul: Exactly! While it’s not the only factor, strong anchor participation is one of the key signals to consider when evaluating an IPO. IPO investing is all about informed decisions. Anchor investors give you a useful clue. Nirmal: Got it! Thanks, Rahul. Published on July 12, 2025 Copyright© 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies. All rights reserved.

Title: The Pentagon’s Bold Move To Secure U.S. Rare Earth Mineral Needs

ByDavid Blackmon ByDavid Blackmon, Senior Contributor. FORT BRAGG, NORTH CAROLINA - JUNE 10: U.S. President Donald Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete ... More Hegseth are greeted by 18th Airborne Corps Commander Lt. Gen. Gregory Anderson and other military and civilian leaders at the Holland Drop Zone on June 10, 2025 at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. Trump is traveling to Fort Bragg Army base to observe a military demonstration and give remarks in honor of the U.S. Army’s 250th anniversary. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) Acting on President Donald Trump’s April 15, 2025 executive order, which directed cabinet officials to take action to enhance U.S. energy security by lessening dependence on imports of rare earth minerals, the Pentagon now moved to secure a major ownership interest in America’s only operational rare earth mine. The U.S. Department of Defense, headed by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, acquired a 15% position in the MP Materials mine, located adjacent to Interstate 15 in Southern California, making it the largest single shareholder in this critical national resource. MP Materials common stock spiked 54% on July 10 following the announcement. It has been well reported that rare earths are crucial to the wind, solar, battery, and electric vehicles industries. Less reported until recently is the fact that rare earth metals are critical elements for making high-grade magnets that go into every modern military weapons system, jets, and ships. In addition to producing a large percentage of rare earths in its own mines, China holds a dominant position in the refining and processing of the minerals and manufacturing of the magnets from which they are made. Ongoing tensions between the two countries make America’s heavy reliance on imports of these metals via China-dominated supply chains represents a significant national security risk. The Pentagon maintains significant stores of these minerals for its own use, but restrictions on rare earth exports invoked by China in recent months could threaten to force a depletion in those inventories. An analysis posted on June 25 by S&P Global notes that those restrictions “led to a 32.1% year-over-year decline in US rare earth imports, highlighting mainland China’s dominance in supplying critical minerals.” The chart below, published along with that S&P Global analysis, details that China controls either the production of or supply chain for almost 70% of U.S. rare earth imports, based on data compiled by the U.S. Geological Survey: S&P Global chart depicting U.S. reliance on imports of rare earth and other minerals from China and ... More other countries. In addition to its status as America’s only active rare earth mining operation, MP Materials is a fully integrated operation which also refines and manufactures magnets at its California operation. MP Materials was created in 2017 to acquire and restart the Mountain Pass mining operation which was originally discovered in 1949 and was a dominant player in the global rare earth market from the 1960s into the 1990s. According to the Science History Institute Museum and Library, production at Mountain Pass “increased dramatically in 1965, after the discovery that europium phosphors could be used to make a much brighter red in color television screens. The Mountain Pass Mine and the Molybdenum Corporation of America (often referred to as Molycorp) dominated world rare earth production and global exports from about 1960 until the 1990s. During the early 1990s California environmental regulators detected low-level radioactive wastewater leaking from the separation plant’s pipelines. Market prices for rare earth metals were low; Molycorp shut down the separation plant in 1998 and then the mine in 2002.” “This initiative marks a decisive action by the Trump administration to accelerate American supply chain independence,” said James Litinsky, Founder, Chairman, and CEO of MP Materials said in a release. “We are proud to enter into this transformational public-private partnership and are deeply grateful to President Trump, our partners at the Pentagon, and our employees, customers and stakeholders for their unwavering support and dedication.” CNBC reports that the deal between the Pentagon and MP Materials involves the DoD investing in a “newly created class of preferred shares convertible into MP Materials’ common stock, in addition to a warrant convertible at $30.03 a share for 10 years that allows the U.S. to buy additional common stock.” The 15% share held by the Pentagon would be almost double the shares held by Litinsky (8.61%) and BlackRock Fund Advisors (8.27%).

(Photo by George Rose/Getty Images) As part of the deal, the Pentagon will guarantee a minimum price of $110 per kilogram for neodymium-praseodymium oxide (NdPr) produced at the facility for 10 years and agrees to buy 100% of the magnets manufactured by MP Materials. JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs have pledge $1 billion in financial support for the expansion of the site’s manufacturing facility. MP Materials says it also expects to receive a loan of $150 million from the Pentagon “in connection with its plan to expand its heavy rare earth separation capabilities at Mountain Pass.” Once improvements and expansions are completed, the MP Materials site will be the only site of its kind in the Western Hemisphere. Speaking at an April conference organized by the Hamm Institute in Oklahoma City, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum advocated for the federal government to make direct investments in critical energy resources. “We should be taking some of our balance sheet and making investments,” Burgum said, adding, “You’re competing against state capital because China is picking these strategically as areas that they want to invest in.” Burgum also advocated for the establishment of a U.S. sovereign wealth fund similar to those held by countries like Norway and Saudi Arabia. “Why wouldn’t the wealthiest country in the world have the biggest sovereign wealth fund,” the Interior secretary said. This bold move to enhance U.S. energy and national security by reducing U.S. dependence on China for its rare earth mineral supplies is an outcome of the vision laid out by Burgum. It also represents another example of the administration moving quickly to keep a promise made by candidate Trump during his 2024 presidential campaign.

Title: What Passive Investing Has Done To Our Retirement

By Dan Amoss PostedJuly 12, 2025 There’s a famous economic law you may not have heard of, but it is valuable to understand. It goes like this: “When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.” It’s called Goodhart’s Law, named after British economist Charles Goodhart. He meant it as a warning to policymakers. If you fixate too much on one data point – like inflation, test scores, or unemployment – you can end up distorting the very thing you’re trying to measure. Here are ten relatable examples of Goodhart’s Law in action. Think about the common thread. But fair warning: once you see them, you can’t un-see them. You’ll be prone to think of the incentives and structure behind every complex system you encounter: Today, this warning embedded in Goodhart’s Law applies with alarming precision to the stock market. The “measure” that’s been corrupted is the S&P 500 index itself. The S&P 500 used to tell us something meaningful about the real economy. Today, it tells us more about the mechanical flow of retirement money than the health of American business. For long-term investors, this index does not offer much value relative to risk. It trades at 29 times earnings. It is far above a simple moving average (100-month, in blue). The SPY ETF which tracks the index pays a 1.1% dividend yield at a time when a 2-year Treasury note pays 3.9%. And the S&P 500’s earnings support, in green, is also far above its own trendline. The index’s GAAP earnings stream is vulnerable to the refinancing of its companies’ bonds at higher interest rates, plus lower profit margins in a slowing economy. This shift didn’t happen overnight. It’s the result of a long, slow move away from active investing and toward passive strategies. Instead of picking individual stocks, most investors now buy broad index funds, like those from Vanguard or BlackRock. These funds don’t try to beat the market. They are the market. They buy stocks based on their size in the index, no questions asked. On the surface, this passive revolution appears brilliant. Passive funds are cheap, with management fees close to zero. They have performed well in the past. And they require no effort. But like so many financial innovations that seem too good to be true, this one comes with hidden risks that few investors understand. According to Mike Green, chief strategist at Simplify Asset Management, this passive revolution has created unintended side effects that could end in disaster. Green calls passive investing the “giant mindless robot.” Why? Because when new money flows into index funds, it doesn’t sit on the sidelines. This money flow is not completely isolated from the index it tracks. Rather, it buys stocks immediately. And not just any stocks. It allocates the largest share of incremental purchases to the largest stocks (like Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Amazon) because those names dominate the index. This creates what economists call a “price-insensitive buyer” – the most dangerous type of market participant. The money flows in, the big stocks get bigger, and the index rises. That rise draws in more money, which buys more shares, pushing prices even higher. It’s momentum on autopilot. Here’s where Goodhart’s Law reveals the fundamental problem. The index has become the target of trillions of dollars in retirement accounts, pensions, and ETF flows. It’s no longer as good a measure of economic strength as it once was! But policymakers, journalists, and even many investors still treat it like it is. This creates a dangerous illusion that recalls the housing bubble’s false signals. When markets rise, it looks like all is well. But the rise may have nothing to do with rising profits or productivity. It may simply be the result of mechanical buying by investors who have abdicated all responsibility for the deeper thinking that drives price discovery. Consider the math of this distortion. Passive funds don’t care if stocks are expensive. They buy based on market cap, not fundamentals. If Apple doubles in price, index funds buy more Apple. If Tesla triples, they buy three times as much Tesla as they did before it triples. Does that make logical sense? Not really – at least not to people who understand the history of large, bureaucratic companies and the law of large numbers. As long as prices are perceived to be on a permanent trend higher, few ask whether those companies are overvalued. This is like judging a company’s value by its popularity rather than its earnings potential. Green explains that this creates a multiplier effect. If you gave $1 to an old-school, active mutual fund manager, they might have sat on it, waiting for better stock prices or more favorable economic conditions. The market barely moves because back in the day, when value investing ruled, fund managers were liquidity providers and volatility dampeners. That is, when stocks went on sale, their demand for stocks rose. When stocks reached objectively expensive levels, they sold and raised cash. But give that same $1 to a passive fund, and it gets deployed immediately into the biggest stocks. The impact that the marginal dollar has on stock prices when it goes to a passive fund is massive – up to 20 times greater than the same dollar going to an active fund, according to Green. A price-insensitive buyer is by definition not fazed by having a 20x impact on the marginal stock price. Even worse, the larger passive funds get as a share of the total market, the more they will become volatility amplifiers. That is, passive fund inflows tend to rise as stock prices rise and slow as stock prices fall. We haven’t seen a lengthy episode of passive outflows, but it’s daunting to imagine, especially with passive having become such a large component of the market. Green shows it in this chart of market structure evolution from 1995 to 2022: A memorable insight from Green comes from a simple analogy he shared in a recent podcast interview with Thoughtful Money’s Adam Taggart, linked here. Green asks us to imagine walking into a rug shop where the shopkeeper offers a Persian rug for $1,000. A normal buyer might hesitate and start to walk away. The shopkeeper then says, “Okay, $500,” which entices the buyer. They perceive it as a bargain and decide to purchase. Now, imagine how a passive fund would behave in the same scenario. Green explains: “The shopkeeper says, ‘$1,000,’ and they say, ‘Okay, I’ll take it.’ Then he says, ‘No, no $1,500,’ and they say, ‘I’ll take it.’ ‘$2,500?’ ‘I’ll take it.’” This scene captures the absurdity of passive investing’s price-agnostic behavior. As Green notes, it’s not that passive funds are price insensitive. They’re actually price-responsive in the worst possible way. “The next dollar that goes in rewards the stocks whose prices have already gone up,” he explains. Meanwhile, as the expensive “rug” gets more expensive, other investments that are becoming better long-term investments at lower prices get smaller in the index and receive fewer marginal dollars. It’s a system that systematically reinforces momentum and punishes value. Green points out that even John Bogle, the father of index investing, misunderstood his own creation. Bogle used to say investors should “ignore price.” But as Green notes, “What was your allocation mechanism? Price times shares outstanding, relative to price times shares outstanding for everything else. That is paying attention to price.” In Green’s view, Bogle’s interpretation of his own method was “180 degrees wrong.” The index doesn’t ignore price – it slavishly follows price, buying more of what’s already expensive and less of what may have become cheap. This is how the feedback loop forms, and why it’s so dangerous. Passive inflows drive prices up. Those rising prices attract more inflows. But what happens if the flows stop – or worse, reverse? That’s the nightmare scenario that keeps thinking investors awake at night. Passive funds are price-insensitive buyers. But they’re also price-insensitive sellers. When the selling begins, there will be no human judgment to moderate the process. If investors start pulling money out of index funds (because of rising unemployment, mass retirements, or fear), those funds will be forced to sell. And they’ll sell without thinking. Other than maybe Warren Buffett in the twilight of his career, no analyst will broadcast a powerful enough second opinion to suggest, near the worst of a hypothetical future bear market, “Maybe this isn’t a good time to dump shares.” It’s just sell, sell, sell – with the same mindless efficiency that drove prices up. That could turn the feedback loop in reverse. Prices fall, which triggers more selling, which pushes prices down further. Calls for a more powerful force – say, the Fed? – to buy stocks will be deafening. One major, related issue is demographics. The math here is unforgiving. Baby Boomers hold most of the wealth in America. But they’re aging. At age 72, they must start withdrawing money from tax-deferred retirement accounts like IRAs. Some of that money gets reinvested. But much of it leaves the market altogether. This creates a steady, growing headwind for passive inflows. At the same time, younger generations face economic headwinds that didn’t exist for their parents. Entry-level job prospects are weak. Wages are stagnant relative to asset prices. Many aren’t contributing to retirement plans at all. That limits the next generation’s ability to offset the Boomer outflows. Green also warns in his interview that technological change is eating away at the job market faster than new jobs are being created. That means fewer workers, fewer contributions, and more early retirements – exactly the opposite of what passive investing requires to function. In this environment, passive outflows are not a remote possibility. They’re a real and growing risk that most investors refuse to acknowledge. If and when these outflows arrive, the entire illusion could break. Investors have come to believe the S&P 500 will deliver 8% annual returns forever, almost as if this expectation is an unstated, unlegislated federal entitlement program. They observe past performance and make the faith-based leap to project the past endlessly into the future. But that belief ignores the distortions baked into the market. It ignores how passive flows inflate prices. It ignores how market cap weighting favors the already big. It ignores how the index is no longer a tool of discovery, but a target of blind capital. In other words, it ignores Goodhart’s Law. Markets are not miracles. They reflect human decisions, or lack thereof. When the majority investing strategy becomes “just buy the index,” the system becomes fragile. It works as long as the flows are one way, into index funds. But history teaches us that trends never last forever. This isn’t a call to panic. But it is a call to think – and to prepare. The passive bubble may not pop tomorrow. But it’s built on assumptions that can’t hold forever. One of those assumptions is that indexes still tell us the truth about real, sustainable value creation in Corporate America. Goodhart’s Law says they don’t. And when the flows eventually turn, the truth will hit with the force of mathematical inevitability.

Title: Patient Thomas Clarkson ready to put his hand up for Ireland

Top Cat! The most effectual! Top Cat! Who’s intellectual! Close friends get to call him ‘TC,’ Providing it’s with dignity! Thomas Clarkson, known as TC to his team-mates and friends, gets the reference to the lyrics of the 1960s Hanna-Barbera cartoon, Top Cat. Leinster forwards coach Robin McBryde got there first when he played the theme tune for the 25-year-old tighthead prop. He’s a good sport when the tune breaches the peace in the sweaty confines of a Portakabin at Ireland’s training ground on the outskirts of Lisbon. He occasionally mops his brow and it’s nothing to do with the questions, rather the lack of air conditioning in 30 plus degree temperatures. Clarkson lived in Brittas Bay until he was nine, played rugby for Wicklow RFC, before his family – dad Finbarr, mum Nina, and his siblings, Catey, Freddie and Dominic – moved to Blackrock where he went to school, first in Willow Park and then in the senior school. He swam competitively, butterfly his stroke of choice, before rugby subsumed his interest. Rugby was a good fit. “I was always the bigger kid, so I suppose it was always kind of fun just running through. I always got the ball on tap penalties and stuff,” Clarkson explains. His current Ireland team-mate Nick Timoney coached him in first year. He won a Schools Senior Cup under Liam Turner’s captaincy, a Grand Slam with the Irish under-20s in 2019 (the first of two years on the age-grade team), and toured South Africa with Emerging Ireland in 2022. Smaller in stature relative to the behemoths he faced when playing international age-grade rugby, he quickly realised that good technique was a prerequisite. “I was never the biggest, because coming out of school I was pretty small, only 110kg or something like that. I’m 128kg (now), or something like that. There were lads (at under-20s) that had played (in the French) Top 14 and the (English) Premiership. They were up in the 120kgs then, so I knew I had to be technically good.” Clarkson smiles in recounting the struggle, not so much putting on size but muscle. “I was pretty chubby leaving school. I got put into fat camp with Dave Fagan (the late Leinster strength & conditioning coach). “I was put on gym-heavy programmes, trying to put on muscle and get stronger. You see some of lads coming through now, like (Alex) Usanov and Paddy (McCarthy), putting up big numbers in the gym. I was nowhere near that. It’s something I had to work on a lot over the last few years. It’s probably why it took me a few years before I started playing in bigger games and capped and stuff. “You can put on loads of weight, and it can be bad weight. You can’t move with it on. I think I took it a bit slower, it took me a few years to put it on. Now, I feel like I can move better than when I was lighter.” Ireland’s interim head coach Paul O’Connell referenced Clarkson’s diligence in working to get the right body shape for a tighthead prop. “He’s been excellent for us. We had him on the Emerging Ireland tour and he’s a considerably bigger man since then. Obviously, he’s in a pushing competition there in the front row. “He’s worked really hard, even from the Six Nations to the summer tour, he looked even in better shape again and it’s a great sign of a guy because he’s in that position where he’s trying to put on size. It can be hard work at times when you’re playing games and training. “Players know good players. Johnny (Sexton) would have always said that (Clarkson) is a very good footballer, and paid him compliments about his all-round game. He’s very comfortable on the ball. He had a few good, tough carries (in Tbilisi), particularly early in the game. Like all these guys they just need time in the saddle. “There’s plenty of things from the game he needs to work on, a little bit on maul defence, but he gets a chance now to go and do it again and show that he can improve.” Clarkson made his Leinster debut five years ago and by his own admission he wasn’t ready. He isn’t patient by nature. “It was frustrating. I made my debut quite early. There were a few injuries. I probably got thrown in before I’d shown I was ready. “The fact that I got a taste of that so early, I didn’t have to wait so long to break through. It’s been frustrating. There have been a few lows.” He continued: “At the end of the 2023 season, I had a run of games (for Leinster) where the scrums went really badly. It was during the Six Nations (and then) we went to South Africa, I got absolutely destroyed. “(It’s the) worst place to go if you’re low on confidence. That was probably the lowest. Since then, I’ve been building nicely.” It taught Clarkson resilience. The lessons were occasionally painful, but the quality of the person and the player ensured he made progress. The rehabilitation process was overseen by Cian Healy, Andrew Porter, Tadhg Furlong and Rabah Slimani in Leinster training. “You’re scrumming against (them), you must learn. When you do get to the standard it gives you confidence for the matches.” Psychologically it allowed Clarkson to shed any doubts. The last couple of years he’s kicked on, winning his first Ireland cap against Argentina last November having originally been brought into the squad as a training panellist. Injuries within the squad provided the opportunity, but Clarkson grabbed it with both hands. In Lisbon he will win his eighth cap, a tally he’s accumulated in eight months. He’s had to remain patient too. “Tadhg (Furlong) and Slim (Rabah Slimani) got the nod for those few European games. I was getting the matches in between and felt like I was putting a lot of pressure on myself to play well. It wasn’t happening and I was feeling a bit low about it. The Glasgow game was when I felt that was probably my best game. “Different things are expected of you (with Ireland). I want to put my hand up here. These are probably lesser profile games for the public but it’s important for me that I can come in off the back of playing well for Leinster and translate it to playing well (for Ireland). “You’re not just going to walk in having played well on the outside. Obviously, they have the lads that they can trust, and they’ve been in the system for years.” He’s earning that faith and trust, game by game. And maybe one day very soon, like Top Cat, Clarkson can become “the indisputable leader of the gang”. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Why I moved out of Temple Bar after 25 years: ‘I feared our home would become uninhabitable’

It was a chilly night in Dublin on July 1st, 1996, when soprano Virginia Kerr appeared on the crow’s nest balcony of The Ark children’s cultural centre in Meeting House Square to deliver a soulful rendition of Seán Ó Riada’s arrangement of Mná na hÉireann. Her star turn was followed by a concert on the stage featuring Anuna, Shaun Davey and The Corrs to inaugurate Ireland’s presidency of the European Union and celebrate the completion of this new public space in the heart of the city. The Temple Bar project was on a roll, with its sophisticated mix of renovated historic buildings and stylish contemporary interventions testifying to the Europeanisation of Dublin. The Ark, designed by Group 91’s Michael Kelly and Shane O’Toole, was installed behind the retained facade of a 1728 Presbyterian meeting house on Eustace Street, with a stage that could play to the square by raising horizontal hinged, slatted doors invented by Spanish architect and engineer Santiago Calatrava. There was something surreal about sitting out in Meeting House Square on balmy summer nights to watch movies projected on to a screen rolled down over the facade of the new Gallery of Photography, with everyone getting a plastic cape in case of rain. It didn’t feel like Dublin at all. Only a few years previously, the new square had been a surface car park, as was Temple Bar Square, while Curved Street – bisecting the urban block between Eustace Street and Temple Lane – was a pair of derelict sites. Group 91, the consortium of 13 talented younger architects who won a competition for the Temple Bar Architectural Framework Plan and then divvied up the plum cultural projects among themselves, were showered with awards for their work, and some of them went on to win accolades abroad. Architects, planners, urbanists and geographers flocked to Dublin, hailing what had been achieved in this 10-hectare chunk of the city’s historic core as one of the finest urban renewal projects in Europe. [ The real Temple Bar: Thriving cultural quarter or ‘a violent post-apocalyptic place’?Opens in new window ] And we were in right the middle of it all. My partner Eamon Slater and I (with help from some friends) had queued for a week in February 1995 to make sure of getting what estate agents would call a “duplex penthouse” on the upper floors of a renovated 1840s warehouse building at the corner of Temple Lane and Cecilia Street. I had been writing in The Irish Times about the vital need for people to live in the city centre, so the time had come for me to put my money where my mouth was. Temple Bar Properties, the State agency set up to oversee the renewal and development of the area, was selling apartments on a “first come, first served” basis, so queueing became de rigueur – though the length of time we did it for set a new record. The sale of our previous home, a lovely end-of-terrace house on Casimir Road in Harold’s Cross, and an EBS mortgage enabled us to pay £195,000 for this 124sq m apartment, and there were generous tax incentives that made it feasible. We were so full of optimism about the future of Dublin then. At last, things were going in the right direction. People were moving into town, populating the upper floors of buildings, whether renovated or newly built. And during that first summer in Temple Bar when the sun shone every day, it was a bit like Barcelona. Nearly everywhere in the city centre, there was something new to marvel at and celebrate. It seemed that pre-Celtic Tiger Dublin had truly become a European capital city. It was such a privilege to walk out of our building – The Granary – and find everything within easy reach. There was a newsagent’s across the street, an internet cafe on our ground floor, plus all the shops on Grafton Street and Henry Street. And good restaurants like Fitzer’s and Trastevere on Temple Bar Square, Nico’s and Frères Jacques on Dame Street, the Clarence Hotel’s Tea Room and Eden on Meeting House Square, where there used to be a wonderful food market every Saturday. Premier among the area’s cultural offers was the Irish Film Institute (IFI), installed by O’Donnell + Tuomey Architects in the former Quaker meeting house on Eustace Street. It was so close that we could be sitting in its cinema seats within five minutes of leaving “the flat”, as we always called it. Whenever I gave walking tours of the area, I would always bring groups through it, noting the metaphorical roll of film in the middle of the corridor leading in from its entrance to the central roof-lit courtyard foyer. Our apartment had an east-west orientation, with loading bay doors opening out into Curved Street. After The Ark opened as Europe’s first purpose-built children’s cultural centre, we would see excited primary school kids making their way there, walking in pairs with a teacher at the front and another bringing up the rear. That was a charming image of the daytime Dr Jekyll ambience of Temple Bar, by contrast with the after-dark, drink-fuelled Mr Hyde persona that it acquired over time. Earmarked in the 1970s for development as a mega transportation centre, CIÉ had bought up lots of buildings in the area and made the mistake (from its viewpoint) of letting them on short-term leases at affordable rents to artists and galleries, funky clothes shops, bookstores, cafes, pizzerias, community resource centres, recording studios, performance spaces and other activities that generated a “Left Bank” bohemian atmosphere, even in the midst of endemic urban decay. [ From the archive: Thirty years of Temple Bar: A cultural quarter or overblown drinking space?Opens in new window ] By 1987, Charles J Haughey could see its potential, famously pledging that he “wouldn’t let CIÉ near the place”. And so, in 1991, Temple Bar Properties – initially headed by Paddy Teahon, then assistant secretary general in the Taoiseach’s department, and later by Laura Magahy – was set up with a mission to create a “bustling cultural, residential and small business precinct that will attract visitors in significant numbers ... building on what has already taken place spontaneously in the area”. There was significant funding from Brussels for what was planned as “Dublin’s Cultural Quarter”, but the money was coming from the EU’s tourism programme – and the easiest way to increase footfall and “put bums on seats” was to facilitate the development of pubs and restaurants. Within the first five years, almost an acre of drinking space was added to the area, turning it into “the Temple of Bars” and drawing revellers from all over Europe on Ryanair flights to enjoy the “craic” in Dublin. In April 1997, two years after moving in, I flagged in The Irish Times that Temple Bar was turning into Dublin’s version of Sachsenhausen, the entertainment zone of Frankfurt in Germany, where nearly every building on its quaintly cobbled streets is either a bar, a restaurant, a nightclub or a tourist trinket shop: “The main drag, along Temple Bar and East Essex Street, is thronged at weekends by drinkers on a seemingly endless pub crawl. The atmosphere can be unsavoury, even dangerous.” [ The future of Temple Bar: Dystopian wasteland or ‘thriving cultural scene’?Opens in new window ] Gates had to be erected around Meeting House Square in 1997 to close it at night because of fears that it would be trashed. Given that one of the primary goals of the Temple Bar project was to create new public spaces, this in itself was an admission of failure – and an official acknowledgment that we have a real problem in Ireland with our “public realm”. Over the years since, policing in the area has been light touch, with an increased Garda presence only after serious incidents happen. In 1998, the Dublin City Development Plan was amended to ensure that there would be a suitable mix of day and night-time activities so that pubs and other licensed premises would not dominate cultural, residential and retail uses in the area. But this was quietly dropped in 2005, probably because Temple Bar had become such a key element in the State’s tourism offer that the need for balance was seen as an impediment to its “success”. Increasingly, the residents were marginalised. At its peak in 2011, there were around 2,000 people living in the Temple Bar area – mainly in the west end, between Parliament Street and Fishamble Street. From 2015 onwards, the number was eroded as many apartments that had been occupied by long-term renters were turned into tourist short-lets via Airbnb, the Key Collection and other platforms. Day after day, we would see (and hear) tourists trundling wheelie bags through the cobbled streets to find flats they had booked that used to be people’s homes. Noise was a persistent problem. Not so much street noise, but heavily amplified music from pubs, venues and nightclubs. As chair of an informal group, Temple Bar Residents, I spent a lot of time making “observations” on planning applications or enforcement complaints to Dublin City Council and appeals to An Bord Pleanála. And turning up in the District Court to object to the renewal of music and singing licences for abusive pubs blasting out noise with doors wide open and even external loudspeakers. Proposals to change the licensing laws so that late bars and nightclubs could stay open until 6am if they chose to do so – in response to the Give Us The Night lobbying campaign by DJs, publicans and other vested interests – filled us with dread and required a serious investment of time and effort in making submissions to the Night-time Economy Taskforce, the Department of Justice and others, stressing the need for an effective European-style noise control regime to protect city centre residents. [ ‘A lot of local leaders lost patience with Dublin’: Give Us The Night campaign renews the fight for a level playing fieldOpens in new window ] The final straw for us came in January 2022 when we heard loud dance music emanating from a premises next door that used to be occupied by Shan, an Indian restaurant, which had been turned into the DL Bar. When I went in to find out what was happening, there was a DJ with decks playing at 88dB according to my decibel meter, and a crowd bopping on the floor in front of a fully stocked bar. If this racket was to continue night after night, I feared that our home would become uninhabitable. We managed to put a stop to it. But we were getting older and there was no lift in The Granary nor any space to install one, so the stairs would have defeated us in the longer term. So we put the flat up for sale in an off-market transaction and got a good price for it, which enabled us to buy a beautiful new apartment in deepest, leafiest Blackrock with views south towards Three Rock Mountain. Monty Python’s catchphrase sprang to mind: “And now for something completely different.” Having made the move in November 2022, we’ve got used to everything being at a distance rather than close at hand. One social downside of being in “the burbs” is that friends no longer call in casually, as they used to do so often when we lived in the city centre; now they have to plan a trip. We still go into town for a variety of reasons, but don’t miss living there because the tranquillity out here is beyond measure. A bit like Temple Bar during the Covid lockdowns, really. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Letters: Housing is not as complex as we’re led to believe – if focus is taken off wealth

There are no signs of our chronic housing shortage being fixed any time soon The observations on the Government’s latest ‘plan’ to tackle the housing crisis are welcome, though they will most certainly fall on deaf ears (‘Bringing back the bedsit? Housing Minister James Browne’s ‘radical’ new apartment plan’, The Indo Daily, July 11). The danger now is that discuss­ion of the issue is stifled by being conducted in the false context that solving the housing shortage is complex. It is no such thing. It requires only that those with their hands on the levers of power approach the issue with the sole focus of ensuring an adequate supply of fit-for-purpose housing, rather than straining every sinew creating and sustaining a source of wealth for the chosen few. Jim O’Sullivan, Rathedmond, Co Sligo I feel I must apologise to the Irish nation in advance. I intend to barbecue tomorrow. I realise this virtually guarantees the immediate collapse of the high-pressure system currently blessing our shores. The gods of weather, as we know, are petty and vindictive, and nothing tempts their wrath quite like the sight of someone confidently wheeling out a barbecue, charcoal at the ready, burgers defrosting, with dangerous optimism. Still, hope springs eternal, and the delicious Armagh delicacy, vegetable roll, is already sitting in the fridge. I ask only for forgiveness – and perhaps a brief, merciful window of sunshine between 1pm and 3pm. Enda Cullen, Tullysaran Road, Armagh Your editorial is spot on (‘Make the most of this welcome weather, we don’t see it too often’, July 11). Even when we see the sunshine, we don’t always feel its warmth with that annoying cold east wind that seems to shadow us for most of the year. Sunshine is the best daily medicine for our body, mind and soul. So soak it in to a factor of 50 and let those shadows fall away behind you. Aidan Roddy, Cabinteely, Dublin Education Minister Helen McEntee has announced the establishment of a Commission of Investigation into sexual abuse in all day and boarding schools. I attended Willow Park and Blackrock College as a boarder in the 1960s. Sadly, I experienced many years of physical and mental abuse. It is very disappointing that corporal punishment, suffered by so many in this country, has not been included in this investigation. Any kind of abuse, be it sexual or otherwise, stays with victims for the rest of their lives. Brian McDevitt, Glenties, Co Donegal I concur with the gist of your editorial (‘Talking about peace prizes as bombs fall is in appalling taste,’ July 10) that Benjamin Netanyahu’s nomination of Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize is distasteful. Israel has always enacted a system of oppression, colonialism and hege­mony in historical Palestine. Its policies were intended to spur territorial fragmentation, segregation, displacement of indigenous people, dispossession of lands and properties and the utter revocation of political, social, cultural, religious and economic rights. Until Israel dismantles its repugnant apartheid system and addresses the underlying causes of this intractable conflict, peace will remain a mirage. Dr Munjed Farid Al Qutob, London The time, effort and energy that went into the construction of the bonfire in Moygashel ahead of the commemorations of The Twelfth, as well as the placards and ‘migrant boat’ on the top, must have been considerable (‘Act that fuels racism – outrage as ‘migrant boat’ placed on top of loyalist bonfire in Co Tyrone’, Irish Independent, July 9). It is not the first bonfire controversy, and is unlikely to be the last. One wonders if it is time to bring down peace walls, do away with segregated schooling and deploy a concerted effort at cross-border relationship-building and foster community civic engagement in the true spirit of the Good Friday/Belfast Agreement. Stephen O’Hara, Carrowmore, Co Sligo There is no doubt that life moves pretty fast. If one does not stop and look around once in a while, one could miss it. Someone recently said they were just minding their own business when all of a sudden 1975 was 50 years ago. Even though we are passing through life, we should never stop having fun. John O’Brien, Clonmel, Co Tipperary The heading of your editorial of July 4 (‘In Trumpian world, our rich ties to US need to be solidified’) is somewhat contradicted by the reference in July 8’s ‘Donald Trump now unhappily president of the US’. Somewhat undiplomatic, don’t you think? Of course, it is in line with utterances from our Government and media. All of this doesn’t look like consolidating our ties with the US. Generally, is it not time to promote balanced and factual reporting on the US, not dependent on biased reporting constantly lamenting Trump’s election? Do we not care enough to seek accommodation rather than confrontation? Mary Stewart, Donegal town RTÉ says the council is giving out free factor-50 in Cork city parks. We don’t want to rub the Rebels up the wrong way, nor do we want them getting any redder. Ed Toal, Galway Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news

Title: How much did a Bono self-portrait sell for? – and the growing trend of investing in wristwatches

One would almost think, that with the ubiquity of smart phones and other devices with prominent digital displays of time, wristwatches would have become a thing of the past. Not so, it seems. During the Covid-19 pandemic, there was a significant increase in demand for high-end watches - almost ironically give that with lockdowns, there was a sense of time standing still. Noting that many people had more disposable income during Covid, “some people saw it as a good time to make an investment in a watch,” says Sophie Duff, jewellery valuer with Adams Blackrock, the Irish auction house that recently relocated to 17 Kildare Street, Dublin. The auctioneer’s current jewellery timed online auction – which ends on Thursday, July 17th from 7pm - has a few stand-out watches among the lots. Perhaps the most prominent of the watches in Adams Blackrock’s forthcoming auction is the Patek Philippe “Golden Ellipse” 18 carat yellow gold man’s watch, dated 1988 (€7,500-€8,500). “This model allows Patek to flaunt its expertise in the field of watchmaking, particularly in the beautifully textured Milanese bracelet strap,” explains Duff. Patek Philippe is one of the world’s most luxurious watchmakers. The Geneva-based company has an on-site museum which chronicles the 500-year history of watchmaking. It includes exhibits of 2,500 watches including a range of its own pocket and wristwatches since it began making watches in 1839. Incidentally, the Irish Museum of Time in Waterford city also has displays of Irish-made wristwatches and the best collection in the world of Irish-made pocket watches, from the 18th to 20th century. Another interesting watch at the Adams Blackrock auction is the Chopard “Happy Sport” stainless steel diamond-set lady’s wristwatch (€1,800-€2,000). “Chopard are known for their iconic ‘Happy Diamonds’, a design feature where loose diamonds appear to float within the piece,” explains Duff. Adams Blackrock, which was recently acquired by Belfast-based Ross’s auctioneers and valuers, offers dual-currency bidding, with buyers able to submit bids in euro or sterling. Items are also on view in both auction houses in advance of their monthly auctions. [ Belfast-based watchmaker Nomadic moves with the times to reinvent retail experienceOpens in new window ] Ken Israel, head of watches at Adam’s Fine Art Auctioneers, 26 St Stephen’s Green, Dublin, says there is a strong and consistent demand for vintage Patek Philippe watches. “In our latest sale [May, 2025], a beautiful Patek Philippe model no 3940 J achieved €40,000, demonstrating the ongoing appetite for refined dress watches,” says Israel. He adds that Cartier watches are also in demand, particularly those designed from the 1930s to the 1970s. “These early watches represent a golden age of design and craftsmanship, that is now being rediscovered and reappreciated,” says Israel. More specifically, he suggests that pre-1973 models, especially those cased by Edmond Jaeger and featuring Jaeger or early European Watch and Clock (EWC) company movements, are particularly sought after by collectors. According to Israel, collectors are more educated now and digging deeper in the history of each brand. “This is reviving interest in forgotten references that combine mechanical excellence with striking aesthetics,” he explains. There will be watches in Adam’s next jewellery auction on September 9th. Duff from Adams Blackrock agrees that customers – male, female, old and young - know what model they are looking for. “We get a lot of interest in Cartier watches too – particularly models from the 1990s and 2000s that are no longer in production,” she explains. Generally speaking, Duff says, customers are more interested in bracelet-style watches, rather than those with a leather strap. Omega watches are also in demand. And although neither Ross nor Adams Blackrock have sold an Omega Seamaster – famously worn by the James Bond characters since 1995 - she says customers do make reference to it quite a bit. Fans of 007 will no doubt be familiar with the product-placement of these luxurious watches, which superseded other high-end brands Rolex and Seiko, worn by previous James Bond characters in the decades before 1995. O’Reilly’s Fine Art Auctioneers on Francis Street, Dublin, notes two other strands of interest in watches outside the vintage and designer watch market. These are outdoor watches, such as the Tag Heuer models, which range from classic watches and racing-themed chronographs [watches which incorporate a stop watch function] to water-resistant sports models from brand such as Raymond Weil and Longines. “Pocket watches – often offered with their accompanying gold chain made from 9 or 18 carat gold – are de rigueur for gentlemen who wear three-piece suits,” says Natasha Bernon from O’Reillys. Its next auction, on July 23rd, features an early 20th century 18 carat (ct) gold pocket watch (€1,200-€1,800). The auction also includes a lady’s Rolex Cellini cream face wristwatch with Roman numerals. It has an 18ct gold case, clasp and buckle on its black leather strap. (€3,000-€4,000). “With no VAT on pre-owned items, you can find iconic brands at a fraction of the retail cost and all our watches are carefully inspected by our specialists to ensure authenticity and quality,” says Bernon. adamsblackrock.com; ross.com; patek.com; adams.ie; oreillysfineart.com Estimate €1,200-€1,500 Hammer price €1,700 Auction house Whyte’s Estimate €300-€500 Hammer price €440 Auction house Whyte’s Estimate €300-€500 Hammer price €1,050 Auction house Whyte’s Estimate £70,000-£100,000 Hammer price £115,000 (€135,000) Auction house Bonhams Sylvia Thompson, a contributor to The Irish Times, writes about health, heritage and the environment Keep up to date with fashion news and trends for you and your home.
