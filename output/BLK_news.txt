Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning If Wednesday was so-called Liberation Day in the United States, Thursday was tariff reaction day in Ireland and other parts of the European Union. Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe warned of the possible hit to employment and tax revenues of an extended trade war at a briefing on first quarter exchequer returns, which at least showed a healthy rise in tax revenues for the State. Barry O’Halloran has the details. In our long read on the implications of Donald Trump’s tariffs, Cliff Taylor offers sharp insight into how the US, the EU and the Irish economies will react. Hugh Dooley, meanwhile, gathered reaction from a number of leading Irish food and drink exporters to the United States. Some see it as Brexit mark two, with others eyeing a pivot to different markets, and all of them still trying the process the full implications of Donald Trump’s moves. Larry Fink heads BlackRock, the world’s biggest money manager. In an interview with Joe Brennan in Dublin, he said the US faces the risk of tipping into a brief recession in the coming months but added that Donald Trump’s policy of cutting government costs and red tape would boost growth over the longer term. Tom Keogh makes the popular Keogh’s Crisps and the US accounts for 15 per cent of its volume. While tariffs are a threat to his Dublin business he is hopeful that the company can continue to offer its products at a competitive price while also pivoting towards other markets, including Canada. Hugh Dooley spoke to Tom Keogh. Our Interview of the Week is with Microsoft president and vice chair Brad Smith, who says the tech giant wouldn’t be the success that it is today “if we hadn’t forged this partnership with Ireland” some 40 years ago. He spoke with Ciara O’Brien on a recent visit to Dublin. In her weekly Work feature, Margaret E Ward explores whether conflict in the workplace can actually be good for innovation and results. Is Ireland really suffering a tourism collapse? Recent data from the Central Statistics Office suggests it has fallen off the proverbial cliff so far this year but some industry figures have been scratching their heads at the results. Jim Deegan is professor of tourism policy, director of the National Centre For Tourism Policy Studies and a member of the Economics Department at University of Limerick and offers a view on how we compile our figures for an industry that is hugely important to the economy. Almost 90 per cent of Irish businesses have suffered some form of financial loss and commercial disruption as a result of a cyberattack in the past five years, new research has found.

Will Fidelity flip BlackRock’s crypto dominance anytime soon? Fidelity Investments is making waves in the crypto space once again, expanding its digital asset offerings beyond Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). In a significant move, the brokerage firm has launched a crypto-focused Individual Retirement Account (IRA), allowing U.S. investors over 18 in eligible states to directly invest in Bitcoin [BTC], Ethereum [ETH], and Litecoin [LTC]. With this latest initiative, Fidelity will continue to bridge traditional finance with crypto, offering investors a new gateway into digital assets. Fidelity’s new crypto IRA product comes at a time when financial advisors are increasingly incorporating digital assets into their client portfolios. In fact, according to a recent survey by TMX Vetta Fi, 57% of advisors plan to expand their allocations to crypto ETFs, with a strong emphasis on crypto equity ETFs. That being said, Fidelity’s crypto IRA options offer investors a flexible path to secure their retirement. Custodied by Fidelity Digital Assets and stored in cold wallets, this IRA product comes with zero fees and supports Roth, traditional, and rollover IRA options. The Fidelity Crypto Roth IRA provides tax-free growth potential, while the Fidelity Crypto Traditional IRA allows for tax-deferred growth. Additionally, the Fidelity Crypto Rollover IRA offers tax-deferred growth for those rolling over existing retirement accounts. This gives users a stress-free solution for integrating crypto into their long-term financial plans. Needless to say, Fidelity’s performance in the ETF market has been impressive, with its spot Bitcoin ETF, FBTC, recording $118.8 million in inflows. It even surpassed BlackRock’s IBIT, which saw $115.9 million in outflows on 2 April. However, its spot Ethereum ETF is yet to attract any significant flows, according to Farside Investors. With Fidelity now expanding its crypto offerings, it even filed to list a Solana [SOL] ETF on the Cboe Exchange, signaling its growing commitment to the digital asset space. Additionally, reports suggest that Fidelity’s digital assets division is preparing tests for a potential stablecoin venture. However, no immediate plans for release have been announced yet. This strategic move positions Fidelity to remain a key player in the evolving crypto landscape. Especially as market dynamics continue to shift.

Impact would be different on different sectors however there is a real risk of all round slowdown in global economies and specifically in US economy which could impact on overall growth across the globe. We are still evaluating impact individually on various sectors and portfolio companies however we are cautiously watching the developments and would do realignments as necessary”. Post the new governor coming in, the RBI’s stance has been reasonably dovish and responsive to the market concerns especially regarding liquidity in the system. Steps taken including the OMOs have resulted in benchmark G-sec rates rallying by ~25-30 bps in this short span of time. Having said that, the upcoming policy would be tricky from the perspective of a volatile global economic scenario with the US imposing a series of tariffs on most of their trading partners including India. The short to medium term impact of the same is expected to be inflationary which may potentially lead to US rates rising. That in turn may put upward pressure on Indian G-sec as well. Hence the RBI may decide to hold rates for now and let the “tariff tantrum” play out. 1.

Source: Reuters The President of the United States has announced more hawkish-than-expected reciprocal tariffs on the trade partners of the US. Per our provisional calculations of the announced 27% reciprocal tariffs on India, could lead to 40bps drag on FY26E YoY nominal GDP growth at the worst. The covid-19 shock is testament to the fact that supply chains do not reorient quickly even when there is a relative comparative cost advantage. As such, our biggest worry at this point would be lower global growth led by US & China. If tariffs continue longer, we see a certain end to ‘US exceptionalism’ and an expansionary Fed, as growth risks may overshadow inflationary concerns. If RMB devaluation discussions emerge strongly, it may be a key global event to watch out for. US services activity moderates; trade deficit narrows The ISM Services PMI fell sharply to 50.8 in March 2025 from 53.5 in February, well below forecasts of 53. The reading pointed to the softest expansion in the services sector since June last year. In a separate release, US trade deficit narrowed to $122.7 billion in February 2025 from a record high of $130.7 billion in January Layoffs announced by U.S. employers surged in March Global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas said on Thursday that planned job cuts increased 60% to 275,240 last month, the highest level since May 2020. Challenger said it had over the past two months tracked 280,253 planned layoffs of federal workers and contractors impacting 27 agencies. Another 4,429 job cuts were from the downstream effect of cutting federal aid. India says studying impact of 27% US tariff India said on Thursday it was studying the impact of the 27% tariff slapped by the U.S. on its imports and vowed to push for a trade deal this year, signalling a conciliatory tone despite failing to get relief from President Donald Trump’s trade policy. New Delhi is also considering helping export sectors hurt by the new tariffs, an Indian trade ministry source to Reuters said. RBI maintains FPI investment caps in govt securities, corp bonds for FY26 The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) maintained the existing caps of 6 per cent for government securities, 2 per cent for state government securities and 15 per cent for corporate bonds for the current year starting April 1. The general limit for foreign investment in govt bonds would continue to be Rs 2.79 trillion ($32.71 billion) for April-September and Rs 2.89 trillion for October-March. Fitch Cuts China Rating on Weakening Finances, Debt Concerns The cut takes China’s long-term foreign currency default rating to ‘A’ from ‘A+’ with a stable outlook, Fitch said in a statement on Thursday. China’s Finance Ministry responded with a strong rebuke, describing the decision as biased and not reflective of reality. Asian markets Asian markets opened on a negative note as the US markets saw biggest drawdown since Covid crash. The concerns on China is likely to exert downside on the region’s asset classes. However, downside on the USD, Brent, and US yields may cap the downside.

It is now trading within a narrow range of 23,140-23,350, and a breakout in either direction is essential to determine the market’s next move. Early indications from GIFT Nifty point towards a potential retest of its previous session’s low; while BankNifty is facing resistance at 51,600; while on the flip side, the level of 50,900 will provide the support. In sectoral movement, IT sector has decisively broken through its long-term trendline and previous support zone, signaling a shift to negative trend. On the other hand, the PSU Banking sector has shown positive momentum, with several stocks breaking through their respective range, making them worth monitoring. Despite the overall bearish sentiment, certain stocks, such as Angelone, Astral, GMDC, Tejas Network, and Torrent Power, have shown strong breakouts, but we will observe how they are performing in the opening trade.

However, while a recovery was observed, intraday volatility remained subdued, keeping traders cautious. Buyers managed to retain dominance throughout the session, with every minor dip being quickly absorbed. Yet, the index continued to oscillate within a well-defined range, creating a stiff resistance ceiling and a strong base, reflecting a lack of decisive direction in the market. Currently, Nifty has established robust support at the Fibonacci 0.382% retracement level of 23,141, signalling it as a strong demand zone at lower levels. The price action suggests a deadlock between bulls and bears, with repeated failures to break key support or resistance levels. Additionally, the index continues to trade below its 200-day EMA, a crucial technical barrier in the near term. With no firm breakout on either side, Nifty remains in a sideways trajectory, stuck in consolidation for the seventh consecutive session. On the technical front, RSI remains below 60, indicating a lack of bullish momentum. This setup points toward a continued consolidation phase, where key support and resistance levels dictate the price action. On the downside, support has shifted to the 23,100–23,000 zone, aligning with the 20 & 50-day EMAs, reinforcing this area as a critical demand zone. The Nifty ended the session at 23,250.10, slipping 0.35% (82.25 points), reflecting a cautiously optimistic sentiment amid upcoming macroeconomic events. With volatility likely to spike around the RBI’s monetary policy announcement, traders are closely watching for a directional breakout. Until then, the index is expected to remain range-bound, navigating a choppy and consolidative phase. Options Market Insights Derivative data signals a mildly bullish undertone, with put writers outpacing call writers, hinting at growing bullish sentiment. The 23,500 strike witnessed heavy call writing (47.34 lakh contracts), solidifying it as a formidable resistance zone. Conversely, substantial put writing at 23,000 (65.14 lakh contracts) highlights strong buyer interest at lower levels. The 23,000–23,100 range has evolved into a demand zone, supported by aggressive put writing, while the 23,300–23,500 range remains a supply zone, as steady call additions continue to act as an overhead barrier. The Put-Call Ratio (PCR) climbed from 0.87 to 1.07, suggesting a shift toward optimistic positioning. With Max Pain at 23,250, bulls have been absorbing bearish attempts, hinting at potential upward pressure in the near term. Volatility Trends India VIX, the market’s fear gauge, eased 0.89% to 13.60, indicating diminished uncertainty. As long as VIX remains below 15, market conditions are likely to stay relatively stable, keeping volatility in check. Market Outlook Despite ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties, Nifty absorbed selling pressure well, forming a solid base at support levels and staging a gradual recovery despite muted intraday momentum. With both call and put writers strategically placing positions at key levels, market indecision remains dominant. The failure to break below support has boosted optimism, leading to renewed long positions. However, the index’s position below the 200-day EMA continues to present a major technical hurdle. RSI staying under 60, along with Nifty’s adherence to its 0.382% Fibonacci retracement level, reinforces a defined trading range, where both bulls and bears are actively defending their zones. The 23,500–23,350 region has become a strong supply zone, with persistent call writing flipping previous support into resistance. On the downside, 23,200–23,000 remains a crucial support area, backed by significant put additions and psychological importance. A decisive breakout above 23,300 could trigger bullish momentum, but with call writers maintaining a firm stance and steady put writing at lower levels, consolidation is likely to continue. As long as Nifty trades within 23,500–23,000, a buy-on-dips and sell-on-rise strategy remains favourable. However, a break above 23,300 could ignite short-covering, leading to further upside potential.

In early trading today, the Nikkei 225 index was down 1.9% at 34,058.23, following a drop of 2.77% on Thursday. Meanwhile, the broader Topix index fell by 2.81%, having experienced a loss of 3.08% the day before. - Agencies Global shock as Trump imposes sweeping tariffs, sparking threats of retaliation and calls for negotiation worldwide. Aditi Nayar, Chief Economist, Head - Research & Outreach, ICRA Limited On India, the reciprocal tariff rate set by the US is 27%, which while quite high, is lower than some other Asian countries such as China (34%), Vietnam (46%), Thailand (37%), Bangladesh (37%), Taiwan (32%), etc. Notably, several items were excluded from the country-specific ad valorem rates. Our early assessment is that the impact of the tariff announcements up to today is negative for some sectors such as steel, non-ferrous metals, auto components and cut and polished diamonds. In our view, this poses a mild downside risk to our growth forecast. However, we suspect that the relative tariff scenario is going to continue to evolve as the year progresses. For now, we are maintaining our baseline GDP growth forecast of 6.5% for FY2026. As a result, we continue to expect the MPC to reduce the repo rate by 25 bps next week, based on the expectation of a moderation in the CPI inflation to 4.2% on average in FY2026. A final rate cut of 25 bps may be forthcoming in the June or August 2025 policy review, based on the evolving growth inflation dynamics India's electronics industry aims to leverage tariff advantages over China and Vietnam, emphasizing the need for strategic trade agreements. India's IT sector resilient to US tariffs, emphasizing AI, cybersecurity, and enterprise tech solutions, but reciprocal tariffs may pressure industries. US President Trump's reciprocal tariffs based on trade deficits, not actual rates, as experts reverse engineer the methodology.

This group brings together the best thinkers on energy and climate. Join us for smart, insightful posts and conversations about where the energy industry is and where it is going. Post Athena Intelligence is a data vendor with a geospatial, conditional, profiling tool that pulls together vast amounts of disaggregated wildfire and environmental data to generate spatial... Across industries, there is a redefinition of value occurring. Traditional financial metrics—centered around earnings, return on assets and financial capital—are increasingly inadequate in the face of systemic risks like climate change, biodiversity loss, and intensifying wildfires. For electric utilities operating in fire-prone landscapes, the path forward is clear: build resilience by understanding and integrating natural capital into core business decisions. Natural Capital IS Financial Capital According to a report by Blackrock, more than half of global GDP—roughly $58 trillion—is moderately or highly dependent on nature. For utilities, this dependence is direct. Power lines traverse forests, transmission infrastructure crosses watersheds, and vegetation management now represents one of the largest operational expenditures in wildfire-prone regions. In short, utilities don’t just impact nature—their economic viability depends on how they interact with it. The first industry to recognize this was agriculture - where weather volatility directly impacts their product quantity and quality. Athena Intelligence's origins are in AgTech and harvest projection. Our understanding of vegetation, terrain and weather trends gives us a unique perspective on your challenges with wildfire. Until recent changes in accounting requirements, the value of this “natural capital”—forests, biodiversity, water, and land—was largely invisible on balance sheets. This is changing. Some public companies have secured billions in sustainability-linked loans by embedding environmental performance into financial strategy. The same logic applies to utilities: the better a utility understands its relationship with nature, the better it can access capital, attract investors, and work with groups like Blue Forest. As utilities develop and refine Wildfire Mitigation Plans (WMPs), there is an opportunity to go beyond CYA-compliance, while reducing expenses. A terrain aware and nature-focused approach aligns wildfire mitigation with ecosystem stewardship— reducing flammable fuel loads, and supporting biodiversity—all while protecting critical infrastructure and communities. Initiatives like the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) are already influencing capital flows. Similar to how climate-related risks are increasingly priced into a utility's bonds, nature-related risks are beginning to shape investor expectations. BlackRock’s own research acknowledges that natural capital is not just an ESG issue—it’s a material financial risk. (TNFD Guidance for Water Utilities was issued January 2025.) Utilities that proactively assess and disclose their natural capital dependencies and impacts will be better positioned in capital markets. Those that don’t risk being left behind, especially as insurance markets tighten and cost of capital increases in high wildfire risk zones. For other industries, the global economy is shifting from an “output economy” focused on production and profit to an “impact economy” where consumers seek brands focused on organic production, customer wellbeing and health. The utility equivalent is resilience, sustainability and long-term viability. For your team, this shift is both a challenge and an opportunity. By redefining success to include nature, community, public health and water quality—not just financial performance—utility executives can lead their organizations toward a more climate-resilient future. This includes: Embedding wildfire and nature risk into financial models and board-level strategy. Recognizing and reporting on ecosystem services such as forest health, water quality, and biodiversity. Disclosing material natural capital dependencies and impacts in the context of today's cost savings and the longer-term public health savings by avoiding the impact of wildfires. Aligning wildfire mitigation investments with community resilience. The tools, frameworks, and investor interest are already in motion. What’s needed now is leadership at the local level. As the stewards of critical infrastructure and vast service areas, utility executives have both the responsibility and the opportunity to redefine what resilience looks like in the 21st century. That starts by valuing nature—not just as a risk to be managed, but as a form of capital to be protected, enhanced, and accounted for. Boston Consulting Group just did a paper on this topic. It starts: As we progress through the second half of this decade, corporate climate action is becoming an increasingly vexing challenge. Evidence is mounting that the tangible impacts of climate change are being felt now, and stakeholders are demanding action. As 2030 climate targets approach, companies are increasingly having to integrate their climate action into their strategic capital allocation decisions. Unfortunately, achieving these targets is proving harder and more expensive than anticipated, partly due to rising project and capital costs in the post-COVID era. Adding to the pressure, the stakes and compliance costs are escalating. Heightened scrutiny from the ACCC and ASIC, coupled with recent legislation on Mandatory Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, requires companies to have credible plans and assess risks across a range of uncertain, and often unknowable, future scenarios. It’s getting complicated.

Title: NYTimes: Trump Deportations Will Raise Wages
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/immigration/2025/04/03/nytimes-trump-deportations-will-raise-wages/
Time Published: 2025-04-03T21:43:50Z
Full Content:
President Donald Trump’s deportations may give a 17 percent wage gain to American construction workers, according to the New York Times. The wage gain is predicted by a New York Times article that described how cheap migrant labor helped a builder prepare a $2.65 million home for sale to wealthy Americans. Without immigrant workers, Mr. Anderson’s labor costs could jump by 17 percent, adding $116,000 to his budget, the article lamented: A shock to the labor market by a loss of workers through deportation and the fear of deportation could potentially drive up wages … Without immigrant workers, [builder Nathan] Anderson’s labor costs could jump by 17 percent, adding $116,000 to his budget. “Why is that so bad?” said a puzzled Steven Camarota, the research director at the Center for Immigration Studies, adding: In this particular example … someone in the top 1 percent or 1/10 of 1 percent can afford that house, but they’re going to have to pay some more for it. Yet aat the same time, working class Americans– bricklayers, concrete workers, carpenters, what have you — are going to make more money. So it seems like a really good redistribution of income from the very top to more middle-income people. That would be good. The $2.65 million house was priced at almost six times the average cost for a new home in Arizona. The New York Times reporter, Ronda Kaysen, explained how the cost of the building’s foundation, for example, would rise by 20 percent: Last September, once the architectural drawings were complete, the building permits approved and the site prepared for construction, a crew arrived to lay the foundation, costing about $59,000. On the busiest days, as many as eight workers were on site. Some days, as few as three or four. Almost 70 percent, or $40,000, of the foundation budget, went to labor. About 90 percent of the crew were immigrants. Without them, [Anderson’s] labor costs could swell to $49,800. The newspaper’s admission of 20 percent pay cuts may be a gross underestimate of the economic damage. In 2018, for example, Blaine Taylor, a U.S. construction worker, told Breitbart News that construction wages in California were roughly $45 an hour in the late 1980s. By 2018 — nearly two decades after illegal aliens began flooding the industry — wages were standing at just $11 an hour, he said. The New York Times article illustrates the widespread recognition in media outlets and banking reports that President Joe Biden’s mass-migration policy cut wages for Americans while President Donald Trump’s deportation policy is raising wages for Americans. “A reduction in labor supply means upward pressure on wages,” Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist with Capital Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch on January 23. “The implication of what’s happening with deportations … is that we should expect continued wage growth in 2025” in construction, Matt Saunders, vice president of building products research at John Burns Research and Consulting, said mid-March. “Low-wage migrant workers might depress wage gains for other low-wage workers,” the JP. Morgan investment firm said March 26. For a decade, Breitbart News has tracked these admissions, which were rare until the election of Joe Biden in 2020. The admissions rapidly expanded once business groups began to argue in Biden’s term that low-wage migration could reduce inflation from housing and other sources. That self-serving argument marked a sudden reversal from the prior self-serving insistence that migration had a negligible impact on Americans’ wages. Many left-wing reporters have persuaded themselves to tout the business groups’ new anti-inflation argument for cheap immigrant labor, said Camarota: There’s still the perception that business interests are in the Republican Party, and as such, it’s very tempting for [pro-migrant] reporters to say, “Look, you’re screwing your own people here — Republicans want this immigration!” It lets the reporters who are generally progressives say “We’re concerned about businesses and we’re concerned about the availability of labor they have, and we’re looking out for this big part of your Republican constituents. Why aren’t you listening?” Unfortunately, what it suggests is a lot of reporters [have] a deep concern for the plight of immigrants, not the wages of working class Americans. Camarota’s narrative is illustrated by another New York Times article on March 3. The impact [of deportations] is being felt not only in immigrant homes and communities, but also in the industries that rely on immigrants as a source of willing and inexpensive labor, including residential construction, agriculture, senior care and hospitality. American consumers will soon feel the pain. “Businesses across industries know what comes next when their work force disappears — restaurants, coffee shops and grocery stores struggling to stay open, food prices soaring, and everyday Americans demanding action,” said Rebecca Shi, chief executive of the American Business Immigration Coalition. The reporter in the construction article explained how she came up with the estimated wage gains: Mr. Anderson sat down with The New York Times and estimated how his labor costs might change without immigrant workers, based on his personal experience, and using this house as a model. The Times also applied national and regional labor trends to his calculations, and analyzed construction industry work force demographics from census survey data. Given that Trump policies have affected both documented and undocumented immigrants, we did not differentiate between the two groups. The reporters’ narrow focus on claimed labor shortages also hides the impact of migration on productivity numbers or employers’ willingness to fund and train the millions of alienated men who have fallen out of the economy, said Camarato. “Employers can respond to [wage gains] by changing their recruitment practices, but also adopting more productive production, such as [the use of] more pre-fabrication than trying to build everything on site,” he said. “Labor-saving devices and techniques that increase productivity, ultimately, would be very good for [national] growth and prosperity,” he said. The same economic trend is visible in the white-collar sector, where the H-1B program has been used by investors, executives, and Indian hiring managers to divert wages and opportunities away from millions of American college graduates. The inflow of mixed-skill visa workers has also stalled corporate productivity and innovation, so denying massive gains to shareholders and tax collectors. So far, Trump’s deputies have not curtailed the counterproductive H-1B program. But some political and economic leaders argue that labor shortages will boost productivity and innovation. The promise of cheap labor is ” a drug that too many American firms got addicted to … [and] globalization’s hunger for cheap labor is a problem precisely because it’s been bad for innovation,” Vice President J.D. Vance told an audience of investors in mid-March. “I can argue, in the developed countries, the big winners are the countries that have shrinking populations,” BlackRock founder Larry Fink said at a 2024 pro-globalist event hosted by the World Economic Forum in Saudi Arabia. He continued: That’s something that most people never talked about. We always used to think [a] shrinking population is a cause for negative [economic] growth. But in my conversations with the leadership of these large, developed countries [such as China, and Japan] that have xenophobic anti-immigration policies, they don’t allow anybody to come in — [so they have] shrinking demographics — these countries will rapidly develop robotics and AI and technology … If a promise of all that transforms productivity, which most of us think it will [emphasis added] — we’ll be able to elevate the standard living in countries, the standard of living for individuals, even with shrinking populations. “The key question you have to ask when it comes to immigration is, who do you favor? Owners of capital or workers?” said Camarota. “In general, a larger share of [national income] has been going, over time, to owners of capital. And I think it’s one of the sources of dissatisfaction, indirectly, for the working class,” he said, adding: “Less immigration then is most definitely good for the working class, including the immigrant working class, already.” Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.

Title: Financial technology startup Plaid closes $575M investment at $6B valuation

UPDATED 17:41 EDT / APRIL 03 2025 by Maria Deutscher Plaid Inc., a startup that provides software for connecting financial applications with one another, has raised $575 million in fresh funding. The raise was led by a group of new investors that included Franklin Templeton, Fidelity and BlackRock. Plaid detailed in its announcement of the round today that several returning backers chipped in as well. The company’s outside funding now stands at about $1.3 billion. Plaid is worth $6 billion post-money, less than half the valuation it received following a funding round in 2022. However, the company’s valuation is higher than the $5 billion that Visa Inc. would have paid to buy it in 2020. The acquisition fell through after regulators raised antitrust concerns. Many financial applications require the ability to interact with users’ bank accounts. An expense tracking tool, for example, must retrieve information about recent purchases to measure spending. Other services require the ability to make payments and manage investments. Connecting an application to bank accounts is a highly complicated process. Different banks configure their systems in different ways, which requires developers to learn the nuances of each financial institution’s software. There’s also the matter of complying with financial regulations and fending off cyberattacks. Plaid offers a platform called Link that eases the task. It provides prepackaged integrations with more than 12,000 financial institutions, which removes the need for developers to build everything from scratch. Link can add bank account connections to web, desktop and mobile apps. The company also offers a second version of the platform called Modular Link. It allows developers to more extensively customize the interface through which users connect their bank accounts to an app. A software team could, for example, redesign the interface pane that displays error messages. After connecting to a bank account, financial services can use Plaid’s technology for a range of tasks. The software is capable of retrieving information about the user’s purchases and investments. It’s also possible to make a bank transfer or configure recurring payments for a subscription. Plaid’s platform is used by thousands of customers, including Zillow Group Inc., Flexport Inc. and other major tech firms The software maker says that those companies use its technology to support hundreds of millions of consumers. According to TechCrunch, Plaid’s latest funding round follows a year in which its revenue climbed 24%. The company also moved closer toward profitability by returning to positive operating margins. It will use most of the new capital to provide liquidity for employees. The funding round is expected to be Plaid’s last before it goes public. However, the company reportedly doesn’t plan to list its shares in the foreseeable future.

Among the topics discussed in meetings conducted this week, the SEC heard arguments on in-kind redemptions and staking for crypto ETPs. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Crypto Task Force held separate meetings on April 1 with representatives from BlackRock and the Crypto Council for Innovation’s (CCI) Proof of Stake Alliance to discuss regulatory issues related to crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs). According to memos about the meetings, BlackRock discussed the in-kind redemptions for crypto ETPs traded in the US. At the same time, the CCI included staking on ETPs among the topics discussed with the regulator. BlackRock’s attendees included senior representatives from regulatory affairs, product engineering, ETF capital markets, and federal policy. During its session with the Crypto Task Force, BlackRock presented a document detailing existing workflows and the role of market participants supporting the cash model used in ETPs. The firm also addressed how these systems could apply to potential in-kind models for future crypto-based funds. Separately, the SEC met with members of the Proof of Stake Alliance under the Crypto Council for Innovation. The group, composed of representatives from firms such as a16z, Paradigm, Consensys, Alluvial, Lido Labs Foundation, and Marinade, discussed staking-related topics and their implications for crypto ETPs. The agenda included reviewing various staking models, including liquid, custodial, and delegated non-custodial staking. Participants also presented staking-as-a-service industry principles intended to inform the regulatory treatment of validator operations and user participation in proof-of-stake networks. The discussion also touched on how staking rewards, validator responsibilities, and service provider relationships factor into the risk profile and valuation of potential staking-enabled crypto ETPs. The SEC’s engagement with BlackRock and the Proof of Stake Alliance signals continued institutional interest in advancing regulatory clarity for crypto financial products. The discussions follow an earlier meeting held on Feb. 5, during which the SEC’s Crypto Task Force met with representatives from Jito Labs and Multicoin Capital to evaluate the potential inclusion of staking within crypto ETPs. Participants, including Jito Labs CEO Lucas Bruder and Multicoin Capital managing partner Kyle Samani, argued that staking is essential to proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains such as Ethereum and Solana. They noted that excluding staking from ETPs could diminish investor returns and compromise the functional utility of PoS assets. Jito Labs and Multicoin Capital representatives proposed two models to address the SEC’s concerns. The “Services Model” allows partial staking through third-party validators while maintaining liquidity for redemptions, while the “Liquid Staking Token Model” enables ETPs to hold liquid staking tokens. While no regulatory outcomes were disclosed, the meetings form part of the SEC’s ongoing review process as it evaluates technical and legal frameworks regarding crypto ETPs.

© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy With more big industrial real estate tenants looking to own the spaces they use, a prominent off-price retailer put down a quarter of a billion dollars for one of its distribution centers in Southern California as its business grows. Burlington, formerly known as Burlington Coat Factory, paid more than $257 million to acquire an 889,445-square-foot industrial warehouse from the world’s biggest asset manager, BlackRock. Burlington has been the sole tenant at the Inland Empire facility since it was completed in 2019. Colliers (CIGI)’ Mark Zorn and Cory Whitman represented Burlington and announced the deal for 21600 Cactus Avenue in Riverside, Calif., while CBRE (CBRE) represented BlackRock. Burlington’s move from tenant to owner comes as it expands its operations. The publicly traded company opened 101 new stores in 2024 and plans to open another 100 locations this year. The deal also demonstrates the demand for and the value of new warehouse development in the nation’s biggest market for logistics and industrial space. “The Inland Empire industrial market continued to see elevated demand in Q4 2024, with leasing activity surpassing 10 million square feet for the third consecutive quarter,” Zorn said in a statement. “Burlington’s commitment to this location is a testament to the Inland Empire’s status as a leading industrial market.” Gregory Cornfield can be reached at gcornfield@commercialobserver.com.

Time Published: 2025-04-03T19:53:06Z

Share this article BlackRock and the US Securities and Exchange Commission met this week to discuss potential changes to crypto exchange-traded product workflows, including transitioning to in-kind redemptions for digital asset funds. The closed-door meeting, held on Monday, April 1, with the SEC’s newly formed Crypto Task Force, focused on the structure and mechanics of crypto ETFs. BlackRock’s team is understood to have discussed in greater depth the potential for in-kind redemptions, a model the firm has already filed for in its spot Bitcoin ETF. In-kind redemptions allow authorized participants to exchange ETF shares directly for the underlying asset, such as Bitcoin, instead of cash, improving efficiency and reducing costs. The meeting signals that such redemptions may be gaining regulatory traction. The conversation comes as BlackRock’s crypto exposure continues to grow, with over 574,000 BTC held in its IBIT fund and more than 1.1 million ETH in its Ether ETF. Senior representatives from BlackRock’s regulatory, product, and ETF teams participated in discussions on adapting existing ETP workflows to support in-kind systems. Since approving spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, the SEC has mandated cash-only redemption models, citing custody and compliance risks. Nasdaq’s filing for BlackRock’s in-kind redemption model states that such a structure would align crypto ETFs more closely with traditional commodity-based ETFs.

Title: BlackRock’s BUIDL fund pays $4.17M dividends in March, surpasses $25M in total payout

The dividends paid in March are nearly double the previous all-time high of $2.1 million, registered in July 2024. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) distributed $4.17 million in dividends during March, marking the largest monthly payout for a tokenized Treasury fund. According to a report by BUIDL’s issuer, Securitize, the record-setting distribution brings BUIDL’s cumulative dividend payments to $25.4 million since its inception, reflecting increasing institutional interest in on-chain exposure to traditional financial products. Additionally, Securitize noted that the March record is roughly 2x larger than the previous $2.1 million peak registered in July 2024. The fund, which tokenizes a money market strategy comprised of US Treasuries and cash equivalents, provides daily dividend payouts Monday through Friday, giving investors near real-time yield accruals directly on-chain. Tokenized US Treasury funds are emerging as a foundational layer in on-chain finance. By providing verifiable, yield-bearing backing, they offer alternatives to crypto-native stablecoins. The sector is the second-largest in tokenization, with nearly $5 billion in size. BUIDL’s assets under management (AUM) reached an all-time high of $1.93 billion on March 27, less than a month after crossing the $1 billion threshold. According to data from rwa.xyz, its rapid growth places it among the largest real-world asset (RWA) products on public blockchains, trailing only four stablecoins in market capitalization. A key driver of BUIDL’s AUM expansion is Ethena Labs’ synthetic dollar, USDtb, which uses the fund for 90% of its backing. As of the latest figures shared by Ethena Labs, USDtb has $1.29 billion in exposure to BUIDL, accounting for 67% of the fund’s total market value. USDtb, designed to maintain price stability through a delta-neutral strategy, allocates reserve capital into BUIDL to earn yield from US Treasury exposure. This structure has made BUIDL a critical component in Ethena’s stablecoin design, directly linking traditional fixed-income instruments to crypto-native applications. Notably, MakerDAO’s Spark will hold a vote on April 3 to decide whether the protocol should follow its plan to invest $500 million in BUIDL. This would boost the fund’s market size even further, making participation in investments by DeFi protocols represent 74% of current numbers. BUIDL has been expanding its offering to various blockchains. After its launch on Ethereum, the fund expanded to Arbitrum, Polygon, Optimism, Avalanche, Aptos, and Solana more recently. This multi-chain deployment is part of Securitize’s strategy to make institutional-grade financial products natively accessible across decentralized environments, facilitating integrations with protocols and wallets across ecosystems. Yet, $1.72 billion of BUIDL shares are issued on Ethereum’s blockchain, nearly 90% of the fund’s size.

Title: Plaid’s $575 Million Round Signals Strength Despite Valuation Drop and Delayed IPO

Informa PLC's registered office is 5 Howick Place, London SW1P 1WG. Registered in England and Wales. Number 8860726. Tracking fintech, banking & financial services innovations since 1994 Financial data network Plaid announced it has brought in $575 million in a round led by new investor Franklin Templeton, with existing investors NEA and Ribbit Capital, as well as new investors BlackRock and Fidelity, also contributing. The Venture Round is a sale of common stock; Plaid has directly issued the new shares to raise capital. In a company blog post announcement, Plaid CEO and Co-Founder Zach Perret said that the funds will be used “to address employee tax withholding obligations related to the conversion of expiring restricted stock units (RSUs) to shares, and to offer some liquidity to our current team.” While today’s funds increase Plaid’s total funding to $1.3 billion, the round revealed a decreased valuation for the California-based fintech. Once valued at $13.4 billion during fintech’s brief hype days of 2021, Plaid’s valuation is currently less than half that, at $6.1 billion. In explaining the significant gap in valuation to the Financial Times, Perret said, “In 2025, tech multiples have massively compressed between the time that we raised last and today. What I will say is that the fundamentals of the business underneath are dramatically stronger than they were in 2021. Revenue is much higher.” Plaid’s $575 million comes at a time of growth for the company. Not only did the fintech expand its product suite, but it also saw an increase in organizations building with its account connection tools. In 2024, Plaid boasted positive operating margins, saw a revenue increase of more than 25%, and experienced an increase in both the number companies and markets it serves. As a result, more than 1 in 2 Americans have used Plaid. ​If you are wondering when Plaid plans to IPO, you’re not alone. A company spokesperson told TechCrunch that Plaid will not go public this year, but it plans to continue tracking towards a public listing. “An IPO is certainly a part of the longer-term plan. We have not attached a specific timeline to it,” Perret told the Financial Times. “As I’ve said in the past, it will not be this year.” Plaid’s decision to hold off on an IPO may also be a strategic move given the evolving state of open banking in the US. Unlike regions such as the UK and EU, where open banking is well-established and governed by clear regulatory frameworks such as PSD2, the US market remains in flux. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is currently working toward finalizing its proposed Personal Financial Data Rights rule under Section 1033 of the Dodd-Frank Act, but the lack of formalized standards has created uncertainty for data aggregators like Plaid. By delaying its public debut, Plaid may be seeking to ride out regulatory headwinds and position itself on more solid ground once clearer guidelines are in place. In addition to regulatory clarity, Plaid may also benefit from a recognition and understanding from mainstream consumers, many of whom have never heard the term “open banking.” Once regulations go into effect, banks will slowly begin in educate consumers on the benefits of open banking, and the concept of the value that Plaid brings will come to light. This regulatory clarity, combined with consumer understanding, could improve investor confidence and support a stronger valuation when the company ultimately decides to go public.

Title: BlackRock chief sees risk of brief recession in US amid Trump tariffs
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/04/03/blackrock-chief-sees-risk-of-brief-recession-in-us-amid-trump-tariffs/
Time Published: 2025-04-03T16:59:31Z

Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, said the US faces the risk of tipping into a brief recession in the coming months, after its president, Donald Trump, unleashed a range of tariffs on the world this week. However, he said in an interview with The Irish Times in Dublin on Thursday that the new administration’s policy of cutting government costs and red tape would boost growth over the longer term. The possibility of a downturn in the US is “not insignificant” in the next few months, said Mr Fink, who has led the growth of BlackRock into an institution with $11.6 trillion (€10.5 trillion) of assets under management since he co-founded it in 1988. “At the same time, as the president’s policies kick in in relation to deregulation and streamlining permitting [for various projects], we could see a real growth agenda that offsets some of the recessionary short-term pressures,” he added. The US president outlined on Wednesday a raft of tariffs being phased in over the next week, including a baseline charge of 10 per cent on imports, rising to 20 per cent for the EU, 30 per cent on China and 46 per cent on Vietnam. Stock market indices across Asia, Europe and Wall Street fell on Thursday – wiping $1.7 trillion off the value of companies listed on the S&P 500 index by midday in the US alone – as investors digested the sweeping tariff announcements and potential for retaliation. Gold, seen as a safe haven in times of turbulence, reached a fresh record of almost $3,168 an ounce. US government bond yields – or market interest rates – also fell as investors bet the US Federal Reserve will accelerate interest rate cuts this year to prop up the economy. Yields on European government bonds also dipped. Mr Fink said a US trade war with Europe and other trading partners does not need to follow, as Mr Trump is merely seeking to reciprocate part of what other countries are imposing on imports from the US. He added that Europe must work now to become more competitive. “There does not need to be a true trade war,” he said. “The question is: is there any validity to what the US is doing and saying? Should we have more symmetry in our trading agreements? That’s all. That’s what the reasoning is.” When asked if he agreed with Mr Trump’s approach, he answered: “It’s not for me to agree. But I understand the logic behind it.” Mr Trump said that the new tariffs were “approximately half” of what its trading partners “have been charging us”. That halved figure includes “the combined rate of all their tariffs, non-monetary barriers and other forms of cheating,” he added. Ireland’s pharmaceutical sector which accounts for 60 per cent of exports from the State to the US, has so far avoided the new EU duty. However, Tánaiste Simon Harris said in the Dáil on Thursday that “we shouldn’t fool ourselves that there aren’t further plans in relation to sector specific measures, including pharma”. The EU is “preparing for further countermeasures” to protect its interest, but focused, for now, on trying to negotiate with the Trump administration, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said. Taoiseach Micheál Martin said Ireland said: “It is important that our response is considered and measured. Any action should be proportionate, aimed at defending the interests of our businesses, workers and citizens.” “A confrontation is in no one’s interests,” he added.

Title: Could Panama Throw a New Wrench Into BlackRock’s Ports Deal?

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Join the leading maritime news network Photo: Matt Ragen/Shutterstock April 3 (Reuters) – BlackRock could hit another roadblock in its attempt to secure control of two flagship ports near the Panama Canal once the Central American country releases an audit on a 25-year concession granted to Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison. Final signature of the deal in Panama, part of a broader $22.8 billion transaction between a BlackRock-led group and CK Hutchison including over 40 ports in 23 countries, is expected to be delayed as criticism grows in China, sources told Reuters last week. The deal’s definitive documentation was initially expected to be signed by April 2, BlackRock and CK Hutchison said last month when they announced the deal. As China’s market regulator begins an antitrust review on the deal, Panama’s government is requesting documents from CK Hutchison, a telecoms-to-retail conglomerate owned by tycoon Li Ka-shing, to complete an audit on the concession. Panama’s Maritime Authority also asked BlackRock and CK Hutchison to provide details of their deal, which must ultimately be green-lit by Panama. The deal includes 90% of the Panama Ports Company, which operates the Balboa and Cristobal ports at either end of the Panama Canal. The Panama ports audit was announced in January by the Comptroller General office as “the most important” of a series of reviews of key infrastructure concessions in Panama. Comptroller general Anel Flores said last week that results are expected in the coming ‘days or weeks.’ Flores has criticized previous audits, including one completed before CK Hutchison’s concession was renewed in 2021, saying they were limited to confirming the fulfillment of operational goals. “We’ll begin a severe, strong audit of those books and company,” he said earlier this year. Flores has also complained about the ‘poor yield’ of the contract for Panama and the slow delivery of documents requested from CK Hutchison. In February, Panama’s Attorney General released a binding opinion finding that the port contract was unconstitutional. Panama’s Supreme Court will have the last word on that. If the Comptroller General finds irregularities in the concession renewal or the Supreme Court declares the contract to be unconstitutional, the concession could be revoked, complicating the BlackRock-CK Hutchison deal and possibly creating grounds for international arbitration, lawyers and experts have said. U.S. President Donald Trump has celebrated the BlackRock-CK Hutchison deal, while China and pro-Beijing voices have criticized it, thrusting the firms involved and the Panamanian ports into the fray of the U.S.-China trade war. However, any hurdles to the deal increase the risk of a hardening of Trump’s policy towards the canal. Since taking office in January, Trump has escalated his threats of controlling places he says could better serve U.S. interests, like the Panama Canal and Greenland. The ports are not part of the canal. However, American officials and politicians have said CK Hutchison’s control of them, along with other concessions to Chinese firms in Panama, represents a security risk for the canal’s operation. CK Hutchison has said the sale of the ports was purely commercial and unrelated to politics. Panama says the canal is operating in a fair and secure way, granting equal access to vessels from all origins. Pro-Beijing media have published a series of commentaries criticizing CK Hutchison’s deal, depicting it as a betrayal of China and a “perfect cooperation” with the U.S. strategy to contain China. The pressure on CK Hutchison has deepened concerns that Hong Kong’s edge as a financial hub will erode further amid geopolitical tensions. The purchase is in line with BlackRock’s recent investment drive in infrastructure, and it secures the fund manager a strong position near an essential global trade hub. The broader deal including many other ports worldwide could give BlackRock control of 10.4% of global container throughput, making it the world’s third largest port operator, Chinese state media reported. The deal has also been described as helping BlackRock and CEO Larry Fink win political capital with Republicans, who in some states have restricted or banned BlackRock from managing retirement or treasury funds over the company’s policies on environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) investing. Some Republicans were reconsidering BlackRock bans after Trump praised the deal.

More business profit, income report, budget planning, bank card, savings refund abstract metaphor. The economy is slowing. And if you believe that these tariff-tapping brakes are going to land us in a recession, these muni bonds (with tax-equivalent yields up to 12.4%) are for you. This is the time to recession-proof our retirement holdings. The new administration appears to want to get a slowdown “out of the way” early. Atlanta’s GDPNow forecast says the economy is already shrinking: Fed GDPNow Forecast Meanwhile the latest University of Michigan consumer sentiment report shows that confidence is falling fast. The index dropped to 57.9 in March—its lowest level since November 2022. Back then we were emerging from a sharp and painful 10-month bear market. Are we slipping into the bears’ claws again? If so, municipal bonds are an attractive income play. “Don’t fight Bessent” is the new cry from investors as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent bets the house on lower long-term interest rates. Munis traditionally rise as long rates fall, a common feature of recessions. Plus, munis offer big tax breaks. Let’s start with tax-free federal income options. Vanilla investors reach for iShares National Muni Bond ETF (MUB) and its 4.4% tax-advantaged yield. For high earners this is the equivalent of a 7% pre-tax dividend. Not bad. But we know better than to settle for a popular ETF. Closed-end funds tend to provide higher yields and discounts to boot. Our Contrarian Income Report favorite Nuveen AMT-Free Quality Municipal Income Fund (NEA), for example, yields 7.4% before tax breaks. For top earners, this equates to a tax-equivalent dividend up to 12.4%. NEA also trades at a 5% discount to its net asset value (NAV). Which means we can buy its portfolio of munis for 95 cents on the dollar. This discount window is a feature (not a bug!) of CEFs, which have fixed pools of shares and often trade at discounts to their NAVs. Live in a high-tax state? There are state-specific muni funds, too. Here are 10 CEFs to consider: 10 State Muni Bonds California buyers of Nuveen California Quality Municipal Income Fund (NAC) are paying just 95 cents on the dollar for their state-specific munis. These bond distributions then get a pass from Uncle Sam and Governor Gavin Newsom for a tax-equivalent yield over 17%. Muni bonds also tend to be safe. With default rates around 0.1%, they are the most secure fixed income plays beyond US Treasuries (which are currently bulletproof, at least from a default standpoint, thanks to our global printing press and world reserve currency.) And state “rainy day funds”—financial reserves for slowdowns—have reached historically high levels, touching $164 billion recently. This cushion helps secure the creditworthiness of state-specific munis. From a price gains perspective, munis are no longer the slam dunks they were in late 2022. I was pounding the table then to buy for the yields and upside. Today, it’s more about the safety because the price upside from here is likely limited. Why the measured outlook? First, while long rates have come down, there may be a floor nearby due to persistent inflation. Inflation data continues to come in above the Fed’s stated long-term target. As I write, the 10-year Treasury trades for 4.3%. Inflation is running at 2.8%. The coupon seems fair, especially given the Treasury Secretary has $9 trillion in debt to refinance this year. Second, there are risks to the tax benefits. The Biden administration’s 2025 budget proposal included a potential impact on muni exemptions. Past proposals have suggested capping tax benefits for high-income earners, key customers for these bonds. BlackRock Taxable Municipal Bond Trust (BBN) is a “Goldilocks” muni play for those of you with concerns about the tax code changing against munis. BBN yields 6.7% and will see an inflow of cash if federal or state tax privileges come under pressure. Not only that, but also BBN can be had for 96 cents on the dollar, thanks to its 4% discount to NAV. How are we handling our munis at CIR? We added NEA in October 2022 when the bond market was bottoming. The fund remains a Buy, but a cautious one—we are keeping eye on the political and inflationary risks to this fund and our two other muni positions. A taxable alternative like BBN is a potential income pivot, if necessary. We contrarians will keep it in mind. In the meantime, enjoy these fat tax-equivalent yields and their discounts.

Title: Bitcoin At Risk Of Institutional Capture, Warns Jack Dorsey

In a “21 and 21” rapid-fire interview with Haley Berkoe at San Francisco’s Presidio Bitcoin workspace, Jack Dorsey—CEO of Block and former Twitter chief—cautioned that BTC’s growing popularity among major financial institutions could threaten the open ethos that gave rise to the world’s largest cryptocurrency. “It probably harms it a bit,” Dorsey said when asked about institutional investment in Bitcoin. Yet he acknowledged that large-scale involvement is practically inevitable, adding, “I think it’s obvious that we’ll see more of it, and I hope that more people take on the principles of what made Bitcoin successful in the first place.” Speaking on the emergence of institutional giants like BlackRock, Dorsey emphasized the permissionless nature of Bitcoin: “To be able to work on a money transmission protocol that’s entirely open […] that has converted the likes of a BlackRock or these major institutions that we railed against in the past—and now they have to turn their attention to it—and yet you still don’t need their permission to build on it […] where else can you find that?” Dorsey’s comments came during a conversation that spanned everything from his early interest in “the old cypherpunks” to the projects Block is building to strengthen the core infrastructure. He highlighted ongoing work on an “open source mining rig and chipset,” as well as Bitkey, a self-custodial wallet, and Block’s integration of BTC into Cash App. One of Dorsey’s main concerns is that Bitcoin might end up sidelined if it focuses too narrowly on serving as a store of value. “I think it fails through irreverence—like it just fails to be relevant to people on a daily basis,” he remarked. According to him, ensuring widespread use for payments is key to making BTC indispensable. “If it just ends up being store of value and nothing more, I don’t think it gains relevance at all. I think it has to be payments for it to be relevant on the everyday,” Dorsey said, warning that otherwise Bitcoin risks “just not showing up in people’s lives” and slipping into obscurity. A noted Bitcoin advocate, Dorsey nonetheless believes that focusing solely on the Lightning Network—a leading Layer 2 solution—could limit BTC’s evolution. “I think we can do better than Lightning,” he said, clarifying that while Lightning “isn’t bad,” it’s merely one option. “I don’t think we just want to settle with having one Layer 2,” he explained, emphasizing that Bitcoin benefits most from experimentation in payments and other applications. Dorsey consistently returned to the importance of open-source development, urging companies to fund Bitcoin Core and other community-driven projects without exerting control. “Having some sort of granting ability to open-source developers is important,” he said, praising initiatives such as Spiral—a BTC-focused division of Block—along with independent grant programs like Brink and OpenSats. He also mentioned the emerging role of artificial intelligence and its interplay with BTC, envisioning a future where agents could seamlessly transact on behalf of users. “It’s all about who you’re asking permission from,” he said. “Development goes faster if you have to ask for less permission.” The setting for the interview, Presidio Bitcoin, underscores Dorsey’s belief in bringing real-world communities together to foster deeper engagement. “I think this is great because it is a bridge between Silicon Valley and all the energy down there, and Bitcoin,” he noted, highlighting the need for physical spaces where ideas can germinate into tangible projects. From building more accessible wallets to reinforcing the permissionless nature of Bitcoin, Dorsey sees plenty of work ahead. When asked what single thought he would leave with newcomers, he insisted that nobody should rely on one person’s word—his included—before diving into the space: “Don’t listen to anyone’s single thought about Bitcoin,” he said. “What makes Bitcoin special is it’s permissionless. You don’t need anyone’s permission to build what you want to see.” At press time, BTC traded at $83,523. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: “This Is Existential”: Billionaire Cancer Researcher Says Covid & Vaccine Likely Causing Surge In Aggressive Cancers

Time Published: 2025-04-03T14:00:00Z
Full Content:
Editor Health Tyler Durden, ZeroHedge Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong – a transplant surgeon-turned-biotech billionaire renowned for inventing the cancer drug Abraxane – has issued a startling warning in a new in-depth interview with Tucker Carlson. Soon-Shiong, founder of ImmunityBio ($IBRX) and owner of the Los Angeles Times, claims that the COVID-19 pandemic, and the very vaccines developed to fight it, may be contributing to a global surge in “terrifyingly aggressive” cancers. In the nearly two-hour conversation, the Los Angeles Times owner leveraged his decades of clinical and scientific experience to outline why he suspects an unprecedented cancer epidemic is unfolding. This report examines Dr. Soon-Shiong’s background and assertions, the scientific responses for and against his claims, new data on post-COVID health trends, and the far-reaching implications if his alarming hypothesis proves true. Soon-Shiong is a veteran surgeon and immunologist who has spent a career studying the human immune system’s fight against cancer. He pioneered novel immunotherapies and even worked on a T-cell based COVID vaccine booster during the pandemic. In the interview, he draws on this background to voice deep concern over rising cancer cases, especially among younger people – something he describes as a “non-infectious pandemic” of cancer. He tells Carlson that in 50 years of medical practice, it was extraordinarily rare to see cancers like pancreatic tumors in children or young adults, yet recently such cases are appearing. For instance, Soon-Shiong was alarmed by seeing a 13-year-old with metastatic pancreatic cancer, a scenario virtually unheard of in his prior experience. “I never saw pancreatic cancer in children… the greatest surprise to me was a 13-year-old with metastatic pancreatic cancer,” Soon-Shiong told Carlson, adding that he’s seen examples of very young patients (even children under 11 with colon cancer) and unusual surges in aggressive diseases like ovarian cancer in women in their 30s. These personal observations of more frequent, aggressive cancers in youth led him to probe what might have changed in recent years. “We’re clearly seeing an increase in certain types of cancer, like pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer… colon cancer… in younger people.”— Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong According Soon-Shiong, the COVID era is the obvious change – and suggests that both the SARS-CoV-2 virus infection and the widespread vaccination campaigns could be key drivers behind this cancer spike. He emphasizes the massive scale of human exposure to the virus and its spike protein (via infection or vaccination). “I don’t know how to say that without saying it. It scares the pants off me because I think what we may be, I don’ think it’s virus versus man now, this is existential. I think when I talk about the largest non-infectious pandemic that we’re afraid of, this is it.” “Billions of people – literally billions – had the COVID virus. Over a billion got the spike protein vaccine,” said Carlson, adding “So that’s like, we’re talking like a huge percentage of the Earth’s population, unless I’m missing something.” “Now you understand what keeps you awake at night and kept me awake at night for two years, two and a half years,” Soon-Shiong replied, suggesting that exposure to both is silently undermining the immune system’s natural defenses against cancer on a global scale. Soon-Shiong frames COVID-era cancers as potentially virally triggered or exacerbated. In the interview, he described cases of “virally induced cancers” in clinics during the pandemic – patients whose cancers may have been kicked into overdrive by the cascade of inflammation and immune stress associated with COVID-19 (Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong: You’re Being Lied to About Cancer, How It’s Caused, and How to Stop It). COVID infection causes a massive inflammatory response, and some cancers are known to exploit inflammation to grow. TUCKER: “a lot people have pointed to both COVID, the virus, and to the mRNA COVID vaccines as potential causes. Do you think that they’re related?“ SOON-SHIONG: “The best way for me to answer that is to look at history. What we know about virally-induced cancers is well-established. We know that if you get hepatitis, you get liver cancer. Hepatitis is a virus infection. We know if you got human papillomavirus, HPV, you get cervical cancer.” We know that certain viruses directly cause cancer (e.g. HPV, Epstein-Barr), so it’s not unprecedented for a virus to play a role in oncogenesis. While SARS-CoV-2 is not a known oncovirus, Soon-Shiong worries its indirect effects – chronic inflammation, immune exhaustion, or “suppressor cells” that emerge in the wake of infection/vaccination – could be accelerating tumor development. “The answer is to stop the inflammation…clear the virus from the body,” he argues, positing that until we eradicate lingering virus and restore immune balance, we may see mounting cancer cases. In sum, Dr. Soon-Shiong’s claim is that the pandemic has set the stage for an explosion of aggressive cancers: the COVID virus itself (especially if it persists in survivors) might suppress immune surveillance, and the mRNA vaccines “that didn’t stop it” might inadvertently contribute to an immunosuppressive environment. These effects, in his theory, could be unleashing cancers that the immune system would ordinarily have kept in check. Watch: Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong is a surgeon who made billions inventing cancer drugs. He says that Covid, and the vaccines that didn’t stop it, are likely causing a global epidemic of terrifyingly aggressive cancers.(0:00) Why Are Cancer Rates Rising in Young People?(6:16) What Is… pic.twitter.com/5QO8AWLtXx A number of clinicians and researchers have reported similar worrying observations, though these remain largely anecdotal at this stage. One prominent voice echoing Soon-Shiong’s concern is Dr. Angus Dalgleish, a veteran oncologist and professor at St. George’s, University of London. In late 2022, Dalgleish wrote to the BMJ’s editor after noticing that some cancer patients who had been stable for years experienced “rapid progression of their disease after a COVID-19 booster.” He cited cases of individuals who were doing well until shortly after vaccination – new leukemias, sudden appearance of Stage IV lymphomas, and explosive metastases in patients who had post-vaccine bouts of feeling unwell. “I am experienced enough to know that these are not coincidental,” Dalgleish wrote, noting that colleagues in Germany, Australia and the U.S. were independently seeing the same pattern. This frontline testimony aligns with Soon-Shiong’s fear: something about the immune system post-vaccination might be removing restraints on latent cancers. Dalgleish specifically pointed to short-term innate immune suppression after mRNA vaccination (lasting for several weeks) as a plausible mechanism. Many of the cancers he saw were ones normally held in check by immune surveillance (melanomas and B-cell cancers), so a temporary post-vaccine drop in immune vigilance could allow a tumor growth spurt. He also alluded to “suppressor gene suppression by mRNA in laboratory experiments” – a reference to preliminary studies that found the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein might interfere with key DNA repair or tumor-suppressor proteins in cells. These lab findings (while not yet confirmed in living organisms) lend some biological plausibility to the idea that spike exposure could affect cancer-related pathways. Beyond individual doctors, some research is probing links between COVID and cancer behavior. For example, a 2022 study in Frontiers in Oncology explored how SARS-CoV-2 proteins interact with cancer cells. It found that the virus’s membrane (M) protein can “induce the mobility, proliferation and in vivo metastasis” of triple-negative breast cancer cells in the lab (Frontiers | SARS-CoV-2 M Protein Facilitates Malignant Transformation of Breast Cancer Cells). In co-culture experiments, breast cancer cells exposed to the viral protein essentially became more aggressive and invasive. The researchers concluded that COVID-19 infection “might promote…aggressive [cancer] phenotypes” and warned that cancer patients who get COVID could face worse outcomes. While this is one specific context (breast cancer cells and one viral protein), it underpins Soon-Shiong’s general concern: the virus can directly alter the tumor microenvironment to the cancer’s advantage. Another line of evidence involves latent viruses and inflammation. Doctors have documented unusual reactivations of viruses like Epstein-Barr (which is linked to lymphomas and other malignancies) during both COVID-19 and post-vaccine immune reactions. Such reactivations hint at a period of immune dysregulation that might also let nascent cancer cells slip past defenses. Or course,fact-checkers and medical authorities argue that there is no credible evidence of vaccines causing meaningful immune suppression. “There isn’t evidence to date that COVID-19 vaccines cause cancer or lead to worsening cancer,” one infectious disease expert told FactCheck.org, though they do acknowledge rare side effects like myocarditis or blood clots were found, but not cancer. While the scientific community debates mechanistic links between COVID and cancer, independent analysts have been parsing population-level data for unusual patterns. One notable effort is by Phinance Technologies, a research firm co-founded by former BlackRock portfolio manager Edward Dowd. Phinance has been analyzing excess mortality and disability data since the pandemic, looking for signals of broad health impacts in the aftermath of COVID and mass vaccination. Their findings reveal concerning trends, especially among younger, working-age populations, that lend some weight to Dr. Soon-Shiong’s general warning of a post-COVID health crisis (though not specific to cancer alone). Phinance’s “Vaccine Damage Project” examined the U.S. population aged 16–64 (essentially the workforce) and stratified outcomes into four groups: no effect, mild injuries, severe injuries (disabilities), and death. Using official government databases (the CDC, Bureau of Labor Statistics, etc.), they estimated how each category changed starting in 2021 – when vaccines rolled out and COVID became widespread. The results are sobering. According to Phinance’s analysis, by the end of 2022 the U.S. had experienced approximately 310,000 excess deaths among adults aged 25-64 (a ~23% increase in mortality in that group over normal expectations). Notably, they argue that after mid-2021, with vaccines available and the virus itself becoming less deadly (due to immunity and milder variants), COVID-19 should not have been causing such high excess death rates. Therefore, those 310k “unexplained” deaths in 2021–2022 could represent an upper bound on vaccine-related fatalities or other pandemic collateral damage. Even more striking is the data on new disabilities. Phinance found that from early 2021 through late 2022, about 1.36 million additional Americans (age 16–64) became disabled – a 24.6% rise in disability in that cohort, far above historical trend. This jump in disabilities among the workforce correlates in time with the vaccine rollout (and was disproportionately higher in the labor force than among those not working). The analysts note that the healthiest segment of the population (employed working-age adults) saw a greater relative increase in disabilities after Q1 2021 than the older or non-working groups. This is unusual, since typically health shocks hit the elderly hardest – but here something was impacting younger, healthy people to a significant degree. Phinance investigated further and found a tight relationship between the cumulative number of vaccine doses administered and the rise in disabilities in 2021-22. In fact, for the 16–64 population, they computed a ratio of about 4 new disabilities per excess death in that period, suggesting many survivors were left with lingering health issues even if they didn’t die.

Title: Trump’s “Reciprocal Tariffs” Escalate Economic War Against the World

Time Published: 2025-04-03T13:36:19Z

It has been driven forward by two interconnected objectives. On the economic front, it seeks to extract hundreds of billions of dollars in tariff hikes, ultimately paid for by US companies and consumers, to shore up the ever-worsening trade and financial position of the US, while weakening its global economic rivals, particularly China, to improve its trade position. It also aims to enhance US military capacity by using tariffs to force companies, foreign and domestic, to increase the level of their operations on American soil, much of which is needed to supply the military. Under the new regime, the US will impose “reciprocal tariffs” on a range of countries. The tariff is not determined by the tariff actually charged on US exports. Rather, a number has been assigned to each of the countries involved. This includes not only the tariff charged on US exports, but all measures such as subsidies, regulations, bio-security measures for agricultural products, and the value of the currency, which the US considers to have the same effect as a tariff in discriminating against the US. The reciprocal tariff to be charged has been set at half that number. Thus, for China, a key target of the new regime, the number assigned to it by US economic officials is 67, and the reciprocal tariff will be 34 percent. This will be on top of the 20 percent tariff already imposed on Chinese goods, bringing the total tariff level to 54 percent. One of the immediate effects of the tariff hike, set to come into effect on April 9, will be a major price increase for a vast range of goods made in China and purchased by American consumers. The European Union, which Trump has denounced as an organisation set up to “screw” the US, has been assigned the number 39, and the tariff impost will be 20 percent. Southeast Asian countries—a number of which have become a center of manufacturing operations for many companies seeking to escape the effect of trade bans on China—will be hit even harder. The tariff for Thailand will be 36 percent, Malaysia 24 percent and Vietnam 46 percent. The tariff for South Korea, already hit by the 25 percent tariff on “foreign-made” cars, which came into effect at midnight, will be 25 percent. And the list goes on. All countries not hit with a “reciprocal tariff” will have a 10 percent tariff imposed on their exports, in a measure aimed, in part, at preventing companies from transferring some of their operations to countries not specifically targeted by the US. Now there is nowhere in the world they can go. Trump began his presentation of the new tariff regime in the White House Rose Garden with his now customary rant against the rest of the world. “For decades, our country has been looted, pillaged, raped, and plundered by nations near and far, both friend and foe alike,” he said, remarking later that in some cases friends had been worse than foes. “For years, hard-working American citizens were forced to sit on the sidelines as other nations got rich and powerful, much of it at our expense, but now it’s our turn to prosper.” However, the repeated claims by Trump that the tariff measures are going to produce a new golden age for the US are a fiction. They will not bring down inflation but raise prices on a vast range of goods. The auto tariffs are set to raise prices on cars from anywhere between $3,000 and $10,000. Thousands of jobs will be lost, and any new plants set up in the US will be highly automated, with a small labour force to cut costs. Furthermore, the so-called “American-made” is non-existent. Every car in the world, including in the US, is the product of a complex international division of labour. For example, the Ford F-150 pickup truck, one of the standard bearers for what is regarded as an “American” car, comprises thousands of parts imported from all over the world. Trump claims the new tariff regime is a magic cure-all that is going to both pay down US government debt and reduce the trade deficit. But estimates of the expected tariff revenue, according to Capital Economics, are that at most, it will bring in around $800 billion. The interest bill alone on the US debt, now at around $36 trillion and rising, is $1 trillion every year as it fast becomes the biggest item in the budget. The trade policies of the Trump administration are internally contradictory. On the one hand, it wants to expand US export markets by weakening the value of the US dollar, thereby making American goods cheaper in world markets. But maintenance of its reserve currency status, which Trump regards as an existential issue for the US—losing it, he has said, would be the equivalent of losing a war—depends on a strong dollar. Moreover, however much Trump harks back to President William McKinley and his tariff regime at the turn of the 20th century, the US economy has long outgrown its national borders and is dependent on an expanding global economy. But the global economy, already experiencing some of the lowest growth in decades, is now about to take another major blow. According to calculations published earlier this week in the Financial Times, the overall hit to the world economy could be in the order of $1.4 trillion if, as is virtually certain, there is retaliation. On top of this, there is growing nervousness in financial markets—already in a fragile condition because of the rise in global debt—both of governments and corporations. This was expressed in the letter by Larry Fink, the chief executive of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset management firm, to shareholders this week. He said, “protectionism has returned in force” and that in his conversations, people were “more anxious about the economy than at any time in recent memory.” Recent memory, it should be noted, includes the global financial crisis of 2008 and the financial crisis of March 2020, which saw the freezing of the US Treasury bond market. Trump is imposing the sweeping tariff regime under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, passed under the Democratic Carter administration, which gives him the power to declare a national emergency if there is an “unusual and extraordinary” threat from outside the US that impacts national security, foreign policy or the economy. The so-called Fact Sheet issued by the White House said the national emergency was the result of the large and persistent trade deficit. It was $918 billion in 2024, an increase of 17 percent from the previous year. The White House statement made clear that military considerations are a central driving force of the new tariff regime. The “reciprocal tariffs” are directed against countries “with which the US has the largest trade deficits,” but virtually every time economic matters are raised in the document, they are linked with military issues. It said that “pernicious” economic policies and practices of trading partners undermined US ability to produce goods for the public “and the military, threatening national security.” “‘Made in America’,” it declared, “is not just a tagline—it’s an economic and national security priority of this administration.” US stockpiles of military goods were “too low to be compatible with national defense interests,” and developments in bio-manufacturing, batteries and microelectronics had to be made “to support defense needs.” Explaining the focus on non-tariff barriers, particularly with regard to China, it said they had not only undermined US competitiveness but threatened “US economic and national security by increasing our reliance on foreign-controlled supply chains for critical industries, as well as everyday goods.” The Fact Sheet outlined the central core of the economic war. “Today’s IEEPA Order,” it said, “also contains modification authority, allowing President Trump to increase the tariff if trading partners retaliate or decrease the tariffs if trading partners take significant steps to remedy non-reciprocal trade arrangements and align with the United States on economic and national security matters.” In other words, get in line or you will be hit—and even harder if you lift a finger. The tariff measures are not just a preparation for war—they are certainly that, and in earlier times could have been considered an act of war. Today, the lines between the states of war and peace are blurred, as the war on the economic front is tied directly to the expansionist drive of US imperialism—the threats to make Canada the 51st state, the ongoing operations to take over Greenland, and the increased bombing of the Houthis in Yemen, to name just a few. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Ribbit Capital, NEA, Fidelity Management & Research Co, BlackRock, and Franklin Templeton joined the round, which will give some Plaid employees the chance to cash out restricted stock that expires at the end of 2025. Plaid CEO Zach Perret tells CNBC that the firm has seen "substantial" growth over the last year but that the valuation drop is part of wider market conditions. Says Perret: “The reality is our business is much stronger and revenue has grown quite substantially. The profitability of business has gotten quite a lot better, and yet we are impacted by market multiples, as many companies are.” He adds that while an IPO is still the plan, "we still have a lot of internal work to do. We're not ready, which is why we didn't consider it right now." Founded in 2012, Plaid helps consumers connect their financial accounts from over 12000 providers to more than 8000 fintech providers. The firm's 2021 $13.5 billion valuation came months after it was forced to abandon a $5.3 billion takeover by Visa after the US Justice Department moved to block the deal over competition concerns.

Title: Volatile Markets Drive Crypto Industry To Innovative Further

ByLawrence Wintermeyer ByLawrence Wintermeyer, Contributor. Recession stock market financial chart on a trading board background. There are concerns about an impending recession in the United States, with JP Morgan raising its probability to 40 percent, up from 30 percent at the beginning of the year, and Goldman Sachs raising the probability to 20 percent. The “Trump bump” has waned with the U.S. stock markets down since the start of 2025, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq leading the sell off down nearly 8 percent. Following “liberation day” where President Trump announced new tariffs on U.S. imports, a new era of trade competition has markets selling off and many economists predicting a rise in U.S. inflation. The President, said he expected his plans on tariffs, at the highest level in more than a century, would create problems in the financial markets but usher in a “a booming economy.” Last month in relation to tariffs, the U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called the market drop a “healthy correction.” Similarly, Kevin Hassett, head of the National Economic Council, said, “There are a lot of reasons to be extremely bullish about the economy going forward. But for sure, this quarter, there are some blips in the data.” Crypto markets, which are highly correlated to tech stocks, have shed over $1 trillion in the past weeks. Crypto veterans know volatility is a fundamental aspect of market dynamics. During transient market conditions, experienced crypto allocators and developers return to the trenches and focus on driving crypto innovation. Extended periods of market volatility often present opportunities for investing in and building new and better crypto products. The crypto economy beyond BTC and ETH can often lack a solid grounding as liquidity circulates from one narrative to another. Instead of generating revenue from businesses with strong fundamentals, shifting capital reserves can often obstruct the industry’s sustainable growth. The memecoin market has shrunk by over 57 percent, from $125 billion in December 2024 to $53 billion in March 2025. Investors’ primary activity has been rotating capital allocation as $485 million flowed out of Solana to Ethereum, Arbitrum, and BNB Chain in February 2025. Byron Gilliam, market strategist and uber-industry pundit at Blockworks says, “Memecoins are not stocks, of course, they’re lottery tickets — some of which do pay off.” Gilliam highlights the memecoin launchpad pump.fun has generated $600 million of revenue in its short 14-month existence and users don’t have much to show for it: Of the 8.7 million tokens launched, only four now have market caps above $100 million. The memecoin market is driven mainly by retail investors. The Dow Investing Versus Gambling chart lays out the continuum of expected returns to uncertainty that most serious financial professionals involved in allocating capital to and developing the crypto and digital asset ecosystem are at pains to point this out. Lotteries are the last stop on the uncertainty axis, following casino gambling. There is a strong argument that memecoins are not cryptoassets, per se. Investing Versus Gambling Roshan Dharia, CEO of Echo Base, a crypto holding company, has elaborated on the retail investor’s plight within the crypto domain saying, “No doubt Memecoins have been instrumental in onboarding the crypto-curious, however, to build a sustainable financial market, the crypto industry must stay focused on building products with real economic utility that solve real world problems. “Memecoins make for great press, but traditional financial institutions are focused on how crypto creates efficiency and transparency in a way that unlocks new value. That value has long been inaccessible but on blockchain rails... everything changes." Utility is an important aspect of attracting people to crypto and creating new revenue channels for on-chain companies. The other important aspect is ensuring safety for retail investors, especially after the $1.4 billion Bybit hack. According to a CertiK report, there were 760 security breaches with $2.36 billion lost in 2024, a sharp 31 percent year-on-year (YoY) rise. These vulnerabilities expose the risk of investors within the crypto industry and the need to build highly secure crypto products. CertiK co-founder and ceo, Professor Ronghui Gu commented, “Hackers are using increasingly sophisticated techniques, and it is now more important than ever for blockchain businesses and projects to proactively invest in robust security measures. The Bybit breach is a wake-up call for the entire industry. Security is not simply a competitive edge - it is a shared responsibility." Mooly Sagiv, CEO and co-founder of Certora, explained, “As the crypto industry matures, hackers will find more sophisticated ways to siphon off funds. The onus lies with companies to develop safer products for users. Incidents like the Bybit hack erode investor confidence, and stakeholders must take all necessary precautions to initiate a trust-building exercise.” As the speculative frenzy settles down for a while, companies have the window to focus on building safe crypto products with real use cases. VCs have been doing this for a long time and continue to do so during market volatility. NFTs and the metaverse didn’t feature among the popular crypto narratives of 2024 in any dimension including mindshare. They were remnants of the past crypto bull market cycle, forgotten amidst memecoins and the AI token frenzy. Yet, according to a Galaxy report, VCs invested the largest share of capital in categories like NFTs, metaverse, and gaming in Q4 2024. The reality is that people like to gamble, play the lottery, and enjoy gaming. These multi-billion dollar U.S. industries, $65 billion, $100 billion, and over $100 billion annually respectively, are growing (globally), and in many instances, and are being transformed by Web3 technologies. It is an important point to bring to attention, especially as it relates to technology innovation and investment where gaming is a leading category of VC investment. VCs often don’t follow a mindshare-based investing strategy. Instead, they identify categories with immense potential and invest early to reap dividends when the industry matures. For instance, in Q4 2024, the majority of capital for NFTs, DAOs, and metaverse went to early-stage companies and projects. According to Ronald Yung from RaveDAO, “NFTs were once perceived primarily as digital collectibles or icons of the last bull cycle, but their real value lies in their evolving utility. At RaveDAO, we’ve integrated NFTs beyond art—leveraging them for event ticketing as proof of attendance and participation. “While the market sentiment around NFTs has shifted, the underlying technology remains a powerful tool for authentication, access control, and community engagement. The solution itself isn’t going anywhere — it’s simply adapting to real-world applications.” Similarly, VCs had identified AI’s transformative potential long before ChatGPT became a household name, and AI tokens dominated investor mindshare. AI funding has grown steadily from just $670 million in 2011 to $36 billion in 2020. VC capital inflows into emerging tech remain strong. In Q1 2025, AI funding outpaced crypto venture funding by a huge margin, continuing a historically preferential investment trend. Although the traditional AI space attracts more funds, blockchain-based AI startups have also started getting capital investments recently. Rowan Stone, CEO of Sapien, said, “There’s still an enormous gap between legacy AI and crypto-AI investments, with institutional capital favoring the former, but bringing together two emerging categories, like crypto and AI to build frontier consumer-focused tech will likely drive more revenue growth and attract new investments. “There’s more we can accomplish to build a smart AI-driven global ecosystem if we continue to develop good products within the crypto-AI sub-domain.” The investment patterns show that VCs have identified more “future-proof” segments and deployed capital accordingly for long-term market growth. The Trump administration’s assurance that the American economy will experience a transitory period is a promise greatly supported by America’s leading Technology and Information sector. The Technology and Information sector is the third largest U.S. services sector and contributes around 10 percent of GDP (~$2.4 trillion), behind the second, Healthcare & Social Assistance – around 18 percent of GDP (~$4.5 trillion), and the number one services sector leader, Financial Services, which contributes around 20 percent of GDP (~$5 trillion) - the U.S. is the home of the global capital markets. The American market boom is anything but over for the Financial Services sector, according to Larry Fink, the chairman and ceo of Blackrock, in his Annual Report. In fact, it’s just getting started. Historically, markets in transition always presented enormous scope for innovation. The ongoing market transition also provides a good reminder to strive for innovation without getting distracted by daily stock market moves. Warren Buffet, arguably history’s most successful fundamental investor, advises us to, “Remember that the stock market is a manic depressive.” In a recent CNBC interview, he said "When valuations swing wildly, always focus on the underlying quality — opportunities abound in the chaos." Always stay rational.

Title: ‘Flood The Market’—‘Major’ Fed Flip Predicted To Blow Up The Bitcoin Price

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. Bitcoin and crypto prices have dropped after U.S. president Donald Trump followed through with his threatened "Liberation Day" of global trade tariffs—dropping an “atomic bomb” on markets. The bitcoin price has fallen back after climbing in the run up to Trump’s tariff announcement as traders scramble to parse the so-called reciprocal tariffs (and stay ahead of a serious new threat). Now, as the chief executive of BlackRock warns bitcoin could end the U.S. dollar’s world’s reserve currency status, traders are betting the Federal Reserve will be forced to cut interest rates to stave off a U.S. recession—something that could see the market “flooded” with dollars. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell is having to recalculate the need for interest rate cuts after ... More U.S. president Donald Trump followed though on his threat of global trade tariffs—potentially playing havoc with the bitcoin price. Short-term interest-rate futures are showing a 70% chance of a Fed interest rate cut when it meets in June, up from about 60% before the tariffs were announced. Recession fears have seen traders have boost bets the Fed will restart its interest rate cutting cycle this summer and deliver a total of three quarter-point reductions to the policy rate by October, it was reported by Reuters. Trump’s so-called “Liberation Day” barrage of trade tariffs have pushed the probability of a U.S. recession to over 50% on prediction markets Polymarket and Kalshi. "Remember—tariffs are dovish, and big tariffs are very dovish," Joseph Wang, operator of the research portal Fedguy.com posted to X. In a closely-watched Wednesday announcement, Trump slapped 10% tariffs on most goods imported to the U.S., as well as even higher duties on dozens of countries. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has dropped as Donald Trump sparks fears of recession and the Federal Reserve ... More suspends its planned interest rate cutting cycle. Last September, the Fed’s surprise 50 basis point interest rate cut helped kick off the bitcoin price rally that fed into Donald Trump’s election victory in November. “I still believe bitcoin can hit $250,000 by year-end because now that the [U.S. Treasury secretary Scott Bessent] has put [Fed chair Jerome] Powell in his place, the Fed will flood the market with dollars,” Arthur Hayes, a cofounder of crypto derivatives pioneer BitMex, wrote in a blog post. “If my analysis of the Fed’s major pivot from quantitive tightening to quantitive easing for treasuries is correct, then bitcoin hit a local low of $76,500 last month, and now we begin the ascent to $250,000 by year-end. Of course, this is not an exact science, but using the gold example, if I had to place a bet on whether I thought bitcoin would hit $76,500 or $110,000 first, I would bet on the latter.” Last month, Powell warned the risk of recession is rising—something BlackRock’s head of bitcoin and crypto has predicted could be a “big catalyst” for the bitcoin price.

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Plaid, which connects bank accounts to financial applications, has sold about $575 million worth of common stock at a $6.1 billion post-money valuation, the fintech company confirmed to TechCrunch. The valuation is about less than half of the $13.4 billion that San Francisco-based Plaid was valued at when it raised a $425 million Series D in April 2021 in a round led by Altimeter Capital. A spokesperson acknowledged the decrease, saying it was “simply a reflection of the contraction of multiples across the market.” Indeed, higher interest rates have led to lower valuations for many startups that last raised at the top of the high cycle in 2021. Still, Plaid’s new valuation is about 15% higher than the $5.3 billion Visa was going to pay for the company before that acquisition deal fell apart in January of 2021 due to regulatory concerns. Plaid will not go public in 2025 but it is a milestone the company continues “to track towards,” according to the spokesperson. In October 2023, Plaid named former Expedia exec Eric Hart to serve as its new chief financial officer. The fact that it appeared to be eyeing an IPO — albeit with no timeline — drew attention. Today, the company maintains that it is “well-capitailized.” “Plaid’s business is in a great position and we’re optimistic about the opportunity ahead,” the spokesperson said. Franklin Templeton led the “oversubscribed” raise, which also included participation from new backers Fidelity Management and Research, BlackRock, and others in addition to existing investors NEA and Ribbit Capital. Plaid characterized the transaction as “not a Series E,” but rather a sale of common stock, which involves a company directly issuing new shares to raise capital. This is different from a secondary share sale, which occurs when existing shareholders sell their shares to other investors, without the company receiving any new capital. The proceeds of the round will be used to address employee tax withholding obligations related to the conversion of expiring RSUs (restricted stock units) to shares, and to offer some liquidity to its current team via an employee tender offer, CEO and co-founder Zach Perret (pictured above) said in a blog post. While the company did not break down how much capital exactly was going toward each initiative, a spokesperson told TechCrunch the majority of the secondary sale was going toward the conversion of the RSUs that will be expiring in the coming years. “We raised the capital to cover the RSU expiry issue and there is a small tender for employees, but it is not the entirety of the round,” the spokesperson said. Restricted stock units are typically issued to employees through a vesting schedule after they achieve required performance milestones or upon remaining with their employer for a particular length of time. This raise comes on the heels of what Perret described as a “record-setting year on revenue, a return to positive operating margins, and a meaningful increase in the companies and markets” Plaid serves. He didn’t provide hard revenue figures, saying that revenue grew over 25% in 2024 and that the company was approaching “sustained profitability.” In a shareholder letter viewed by TechCrunch, Perret also wrote that new products represented more than 20% of Plaid’s ARR in 2024, “compounding at 93% annually.” Founded in 2012, Plaid got its start as a company that connects consumer bank accounts to financial applications but has since been gradually expanding its offerings to also include lending, identity verification, credit reporting, anti-fraud, and payments. Being a multi-product company has led to traction beyond the traditional fintech customers it started out serving. President Jen Taylor told TechCrunch last June that enterprise and traditional financial institution growth was “starting to outpace the rest of its business.” Overall, Plaid saw “a big upswing in the number of enterprises” it serves in 2024, Perret wrote in the shareholder letter. The company counts Citi, Robinhood, H&R Block, Invitation Homes, GoFundMe, Zillow, and Rocket as “key customers.” Perret also wrote: “Our goal is to build software that makes the financial system easier and better for everyone. Our products are the bedrock upon which many of the most well-known financial brands are built – companies like Affirm, Chime, Robinhood, and SoFi.” Plaid has raised about $1.3 billion in funding over its lifetime. Presently, it has 1,200 employees across the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the EU.

Title: Plaid Raises $575 Million In Funding At $6.1 Billion Valuation

ByJeff Kauflin ByJeff Kauflin, Forbes Staff. Plaid CEO Zach Perret is raising money to cover an upcoming tax bill and to let employees sell some of their Plaid stock. San Francisco-based Plaid, whose main business is helping fintechs and other companies connect to consumers’ bank accounts, is raising $575 million in a deal that values it at $6.1 billion, down more than 50% from the $13.4 billion it reached in 2021. The investment is being led by large asset management firms including Franklin Templeton, Fidelity Management and Research and BlackRock, with venture capital firms NEA and Ribbit also investing. A spokesperson for the 12-year-old company says most of the proceeds will be used to cover tax liabilities that will come due over the next few years, when employees’ restricted stock units (RSUs)—a form of equity compensation where a business promises to grant you stock at a future date–vest and convert into common stock. Plaid will use a “small portion” of the $575 million fundraise to buy back stock from employees in a tender offer, letting them cash out a small part of their Plaid stock, according to a spokesperson. After Plaid pays for its coming tax liability and the employee tender offer, it will use whatever is left of the $575 million to help fund its business, though it expects that to be “a minimal amount.” Have a story tip? Contact Jeff Kauflin at jkauflin@forbes.com or on Signal at jeff.273. Stripe took a similar step in March 2023 with a $6.5 billion tender offer that allowed employees to sell their private shares in the company, and it has done at least two more tender offers since then. In recent years, Plaid has expanded beyond its core bank-account-linking features into three new lines of business: credit-risk analytics, fraud prevention and pay-by-bank. That has helped reverse the growth slowdown the company saw in 2023, when it expanded just 12%. In 2024, its revenue rose 25% and exceeded $300 million, and its gross profit margin was roughly 80%, according to a person familiar with its business. The company still wasn’t profitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis. The fintech market has improved notably since it began on a downward trajectory in 2022. In the first quarter of 2025, fintechs raised roughly $10.3 billion in funding globally, according to CB Insights, the highest quarterly total since the first quarter of 2023. Digital bank Chime and buy-now, pay-later giant Klarna are planning to go public over the next few months, but Plaid is unlikely to try to IPO this year. “Our hope is that we will get there in the next couple years, but no plans for a 2025 IPO,” Plaid CEO Zach Perret told Bloomberg in January. Last month, The Information reported that Plaid was planning a fundraise at a valuation of roughly $6 billion.

Many people could be left disappointed when they open their IRA statements in the coming days — and President Donald Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs threaten to make things even worse. The S&P 500 fell 5% in the first three months of 2025, marking its worst quarter since 2022, while the Nasdaq Composite slumped 10% as stocks like Tesla plunged 36%. Those declines have taken a bite out of many people's investments in the stock market, and could disrupt their retirement plans if they continue. "For the small investor, the decline in value will be devastating, particularly for retired baby boomers" who draw their incomes from their retirement accounts, Peter Ricchiuti, a senior professor of finance at Tulane University's Freeman School of Business, told Business Insider. The sell-off is partly in reaction to Trump's topsy-turvy tariffs in recent weeks, which have made it "impossible" for business owners to make decisions, Ricchiuti said. The former investment manager, who once oversaw Louisiana's $3 billion portfolio as the assistant state treasurer, said that running a company has become a "game of Whack-A-Mole" because everyone is trying to guess which industry will be hit next. Trump unveiled tariffs of at least 10% on imports from virtually all foreign countries on Wednesday, with higher rates for nations with a large trade deficit with the US. Goods from China, the number-two exporter to the US after Mexico, will be subject to a 54% tariff from April 9 if nothing changes. The news sent the S&P down almost 5% on Thursday, as key constituents Tesla and Nvidia tumbled by about 6% and 8% respectively. Tariffs push up costs for companies and prices for consumers, while uncertainty discourages hiring, expansion, and spending. Those forces slow corporate earnings growth, eroding valuations and sending stocks lower, Ricchiuti said. Strategists at Goldman Sachs cut their S&P 500 forecast last week, citing the incoming tariffs as their main rationale. They predicted the index would decline a further 5% this quarter and gain 6% over the next 12 months, down from 0% and 16%, respectively. One pressing concern is that Trump ratcheting up import taxes will cause countries around the world to retaliate by imposing reciprocal tariffs on imports from the US. Ricchiuti said that's one reason why tariffs never succeed in leveling terms of trade and instead act as "prosperity killers." During Trump's first term, he imposed sweeping tariffs on goods ranging from steel and aluminum to solar panels and washing machines, and broad-based duties on imports from China. The tariffs led to material price increases and reductions in Americans' real income, studies have found. Another worry for investors and everyday Americans alike is that if tariffs lead consumers to cut back on spending and companies to retrench, overall economic growth could suffer. Ricchiuti flagged there is mounting concern on Wall Street that Trump's trade battles will "cause a recession or even the much-feared stagflation." BlackRock CEO Larry Fink described the national mood in his yearly letter on Monday.

An unexpected bright spot in the months following Trump’s election victory was his repeated support for some kind of agreement with China. Under Biden, the two most powerful countries in the world had seemed headed for certain conflict, and Trump’s campaign bluster promised even worse tensions. But now Trump was claiming that the two countries “can, together, solve all of the problems of the world,” and China was discreetly sending out feelers about what it could offer to bring off such a deal. Then suddenly, the whole tenor of the relationship abruptly changed. On March 4, China’s Foreign Ministry said: “If the US is determined to fight a tariff war, a trade war—or any other kind of war—China will meet the attack and fight to the finish.” Two days later, the ministry doubled down on the theme, promising that, “no matter if it’s a cold war or a hot war,” the US will not win. The events of March 4 lay bare the reasons that Trump is, at one and the same time, tantalizingly close to his proclaimed goal of world peace and alarmingly close to sending the relationship with China spiraling into conflict. Trump’s antipathy toward the global order, now inspiring an unprecedented attack on the post-Cold War institutions that once sustained American power, is both the reason he can offer such a deal and a source of deep disquiet in Beijing. Deciphering this tension is the key to understanding not just Trump’s China policy but his whole foreign policy agenda. What led to the sudden shift in Chinese rhetoric? Earlier on March 4, alongside 25 percent tariffs on Mexico and Canada that were soon suspended, Trump unceremoniously imposed on China his second across-the-board 10 percent tariff increase in as many months. Like the first one, he justified this one with an absolutist demand—difficult both practically and politically—that China immediately suppress the production of all fentanyl precursor chemicals. Just weeks into his second term, Trump has already quietly levied larger tariffs on China than across the entire world-shaking trade war of his first term—and those first-term tariffs are still in place. Also on March 4, Hong Kong firm C K Hutchison announced that it would sell its overseas ports business—including its two (of five total) Panama Canal ports—to US asset firm BlackRock. While both companies insisted that the sale was a normal commercial transaction, the context of Trump’s repeated condemnation of a “Chinese” presence in the canal was lost on no one. China is now considering how it might prevent the sale from going forward. In his address to Congress that same night, Trump bragged about the ports sale but otherwise barely raised the issue of China. His repeated threats against the territorial integrity of various allies, though, must have raised questions within the sovereignty-obsessed Chinese leadership. Despite these misgivings, Beijing has continued to express its interest in negotiations. After all, Trump’s mercantile sensibility and his disdain for the sacred cows of American geopolitical primacy allow him to take seriously Chinese interests and consider a settlement that could work for both powers. This marks a sharp contrast with Biden’s foreign policy team, who imagined they could avoid conflict with China by conducting rudimentary diplomatic routines even as they steadily exacerbated the pressures toward conflict. The core Biden strategy was to build up US alliances around the principle of excluding China while offering concessions to countries in the Global South if they joined such an exclusionary regime. Convinced of their own righteousness, the administration had difficulty recognizing how such an approach looked from Beijing. Trump, in contrast, recognizes a kindred spirit in Xi Jinping, who shares his own priorities of commercial success and authoritarian control. Unlike Biden’s foreign policy team, Trump does not seek strategic advantage over every space of geopolitical power in the world, so he is less likely to exacerbate Beijing’s fears of encirclement or its anxiety that Taiwan could be permanently separated. Moreover, Trump conceptualizes the economy as a market, where those with bargaining power squeeze profit out of those who lack it, rather than a supply chain, in which power accumulates at strategic nodes associated with scarce goods or technologies. This, too, makes agreement with Beijing more likely, since Trump places less priority than Biden on strangling China’s access to technology or demanding deep changes to China’s political economy. All of this substantiates the hope that the US and China could conclude an agreement capable of breaking the momentum toward conflict. More than Trump’s hunger to see himself as a dealmaker, his whole mode of reasoning establishes the conditions for mutual accommodation between the two powers. Yet both the style and substance of Trump’s leadership also pose a significant threat to that potential. Despite a more pliable set of officials staffing his second than his first administration, the trademark chaos of the first term is just as evident today. That is profoundly unnerving to Beijing, characteristically stuck on protocol and obsessed with stability. Illustrative of the diplomatic pitfalls of such disorganization is that, even after two rounds of punishing tariffs, the administration still can’t explain what it actually wants from China. The shift in Chinese rhetoric in part registers exasperation. However, the most dangerous part of Trump’s foreign policy is not the erratic diplomacy but what seems to be the unifying line running through all the vacillations. Whether threatening to annex neighbors, smashing up the world humanitarian system, shredding the rules of global trade, or actively supporting the nativist opposition across a number of allies, the common thread of all the administration’s early foreign policy moves is open hostility to what remains of the institutions and ideology of neoliberal globalization. Ben Ehrenreich Jeet Heer Dave Zirin Books & the Arts / David Klion For four decades, this so-called liberal international order secured America’s position as global hegemon by convincing elites in other countries that they too could gain from free market reform, corporate power, political liberalization, and US suzerainty. But in part because the system failed an increasingly large number of Americans and in part because it constrained the naked exercise of force, the Trump administration now aims to eradicate it. Chinese leaders may be perfectly happy to see hypocritical American paeans to democracy and the rule of law despoiled. The danger is that those same leaders are deeply invested in other core institutions of the system—those parts that secure stability for commerce, promote economic development, and legitimize governing elites. Contrary to the portrayal that dominates DC thinking, in which China is thought to be bent on destroying the rules-based international order so that it can bully weaker countries for gain, China is in fact a cautious and conservative status quo power. It is hostile to those parts of the global system that undermine the political regime’s claims or that represent the unilateral use of force, but the rules of world trade, the prerogatives of state sovereignty, the smooth operation of multilateral institutions to address transnational problems, and the right to development for every country are all basic commitments in state policy. The official line that Chinese foreign policy seeks “win-win cooperation” is based on the (often unreliable) assumption that all these principles are mutually beneficial. Polemical depictions of China come much closer to describing the aims of Trump’s foreign policy than Xi Jinping’s. Ironically, the Trump administration might accept the DC portrayal of Chinese goals as accurate but unobjectionable—surely all great powers would squeeze their neighbors if the artificial constraints of global order were removed. They may believe that they can make Beijing an attractive offer: no longer trying to cut China out of the system and instead simply destroying the system, after which the great powers will be free to work out among themselves how to divide the spoils. If the United States builds an exclusionary sphere of interest in the Western Hemisphere, China could make peace with that because it could prey on countries in its own sphere to make up for lost tribute. We do not know whether anyone in the administration has gone this far in working out the consequences of their current path. But the logic of US actions is great-power predation pushing in the direction of closed imperial blocs. Such an outcome is a nonstarter with China—not just because Beijing would not trust the US to leave it enough space for its own depredations, but because it considers parts of the liberal international order crucial to its own success.
