MUMBAI: Jio Financial Services is not letting its late entry into the financial services space deter it from aiming for the top. Backed by the Jio brand, data support from parent companies, and learnings from peers, the non-banking financial company (NBFC) hopes to become a “constructive disruptor”. “For us, in financial services, we hope to be what I call ‘constructively disruptive’,” managing director and chief executive officer Hitesh Sethia said at the Mint BFSI Conclave 2025 on 12 December. “One has to be price competitive because that is true value for the customer. We will have to play on the advantage of cost and scale.” Jio Financial Services is the holding company for several businesses: NBFC Jio Credit Ltd, Jio Payments Bank Ltd, wealth management joint venture Jio BlackRock Investment Advisers Pvt Ltd, and asset management joint venture Jio BlackRock Asset Management Pvt Ltd, among others. Sethia said pricing competitiveness will come not through a price war but via cost engineering at scale, underpinned by technology. “We have the advantage to set everything from a zero base. If we are able to do that with today's modern technology, with the brand and capital that we have, there is a good chance we have in creating value for customers and capturing value for shareholders,” Sethia said. “That is an equation that can be solved.” He highlighted that Jio Financial’s late entry allows it to incorporate lessons from decades of industry data across timing the market, product segments, customer segments, and distribution channels. “Technology can certainly make a lot of products DIY (do-it-yourself). It can also digitize the distribution channel, make that intelligent and far more efficient. That is happening as we see.” The NBFC had assets under management (AUM) worth ₹14,712 crore as of end of September, while the AUM of the AMC business was at ₹15,980 crore across nine funds. The wealth management, broking and insurance businesses are still in the incubation phase. Demerged from Reliance Industries and listed in 2023, Jio Financial underwent a management and business overhaul to grow its loan book across home loans, loans against property, loans against mutual funds, loans against shares, and supply chain finance. Sethia, appointed CEO in November 2023, considers Jio Financial both a startup and a late entrant, but one blessed with two things most startups take years to build: brand and capital. “We were born with two things, which most startups take many years to build,” Sethia said, adding that the goal now is to build a “stable, steady” financial institution which is able to “last decades and weather the cycles that come with lending”. The plan is to start with secured loan products and later look at other loan products that “may be needed”, he said. Partnerships form a cornerstone of Jio Financial’s strategy. The company has 50:50 joint ventures (JVs) with BlackRock for asset management, wealth management, and broking. It has another 50:50 JV with Allianz Insurance for reinsurance, and has signed non-binding agreements with Allianz to enter life and general insurance. The company is also leveraging the Jio ecosystem. “We are present in MyJio, which is a part of the Jio telecom company. The MyJio app has a few hundred million monthly active users. That gives us a funnel for Jio Finance as well. There is clearly a case for collaboration between industries,” he said, citing the example of telecom and e-commerce with financial services. “In an eventual scale, we expect to be a full-scale service firm. We will span across the entire length and breadth of the country,” Sethia said. With Jio Payments Bank’s banking correspondent network, Jio Financial already has over 200,000 touchpoints nationwide and 18 million mobile app users. “The game has to be expanding the market rather than trying to eat up just the existing market share,” said Sethia, who sees opportunity in taking wealth management services to people in the ‘the middle of the pyramid’ as well as offering better services to people at the 'top of the pyramid'. Sethia emphasized simplifying financial services, meeting evolving customer expectations, and moving from a “digital first to intelligent always” approach. “Simply put, financial services has to work like Wi-Fi. When you need it, it is available and when you don't, it's quiet in the background.” Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

Title: Warner Bros. is blockbuster finale to $4.5 trillion M&A haul
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/12/15/mergers-acquisitions-4-5-trillion-warner-bros-second-highest-year-ever/
Time Published: 2025-12-15T23:27:32Z
Full Content:
Dealmakers are heading into the final weeks of 2025 on a $100 billion cliffhanger. Paramount Skydance Corp.’s hostile bid to snatch Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. from under the nose of Netflix Inc. encapsulates the themes that have shaped a banner year for mergers and acquisitions: renewed desire for transformative tie-ups, massive checks from Wall Street, the flow of Middle East money and US President Donald Trump’s role as both disruptor and dealmaker. Global transaction values have risen around 40% to about $4.5 trillion this year, data compiled by Bloomberg show, as companies chase ultra-ambitious combinations, emboldened by friendlier regulators. That’s the second-highest tally on record and includes the biggest haul of deals valued at $30 billion or more. “There’s a sentiment in boardrooms and among CEOs that this is a potential multi-year window where it’s possible to dream big,” said Ben Wallace, co-head of Americas M&A at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. “We’re at the beginning of a rate-cutting cycle so there’s anticipation that there will be more liquidity.” Beyond Netflix’s purchase of Warner Bros., this year’s blockbusters include Union Pacific Corp.’s acquisition of rival railroad operator Norfolk Southern Corp. for more than $80 billion including debt, the record leveraged buyout of video game maker Electronic Arts Inc., and Anglo American Plc’s takeover of Teck Resources Ltd. to reshape global mining. “When you look around and you see your peers doing these big deals and taking advantage of the tailwinds, you don’t want to be left out,” said Maggie Flores, partner at law firm Kirkland & Ellis LLP in New York. “The regulatory environment is in a position that is very conducive to dealmaking and people are taking advantage of it.” The tally also shows a level of exuberance in certain pockets that some advisers and analysts worry is unsustainable. Global trade tensions are ongoing, and market observers are increasingly warning of a selloff in the white-hot equity markets that have underpinned the M&A resurgence. Top executives at Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley have all flagged the risk of a correction in the months ahead, in part tied to concerns about an overheated artificial intelligence ecosystem, where huge amounts of investment have juiced technology stocks. “These equity returns are really coming out of AI, and AI spend is not sustainable,” said Charlie Dupree, global chair of investment banking at JPMorgan. “If that pulls back, then you are going to see a broader market that isn’t really advancing.” The AI buzz led to some the year’s standout transactions. Sam Altman’s OpenAI took in major investments from the likes of SoftBank Group Corp., Nvidia Corp. and Walt Disney Co., and a consortium led by BlackRock Inc.’s Global Infrastructure Partners agreed to pay $40 billion for Aligned Data Centers. In March, Google parent Alphabet Inc. framed its $32 billion acquisition of cybersecurity startup Wiz Inc. as a way to provide customers with new safeguards in the AI era. “Everyone needs to be an AI banker now,” said Wally Cheng, head of global technology M&A at Morgan Stanley. “Just as software began eating the world 15 years ago, AI is now eating software. You have to be conversant in AI and understand how it will affect every company.” The technology sector more broadly has already notched a record year for deals, thanks to a series of big-ticket takeovers across public and private markets. The trend extended to the White House over the summer, when the US government took a roughly 10% stake in Intel Corp. in an unconventional move aimed at reinvigorating the company and boosting domestic chip manufacturing. It was one of the clearest indications of Trump’s willingness to blur the lines between state and industry and insert himself into M&A situations during his second term, particularly in sectors deemed mission critical. His administration also acquired a stake in rare-earth producer MP Materials Corp. and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has hinted at similar deals in the defense sector. Trump has separately been positioning himself as kingmaker on high-profile transactions. The government secured a so-called golden share in United States Steel Corp. as a condition for approving its takeover by Japan’s Nippon Steel Corp., and the president recently signaled he’ll oppose any acquisition of Warner Bros. that doesn’t include new ownership of CNN. “The Trump administration’s approach to merger regulation today is markedly different compared to the first time around,” said Brian Quinn, a professor at Boston College Law School. Quinn said he couldn’t think of a member of the Republican Party from 15 to 20 years ago who would now believe the US government “is involved in the business of picking winners.” To be sure, bankers will be wondering if they could have achieved more in 2025 had it not been for the chaotic period earlier in the year, when deals were put on hold after Trump’s trade war hobbled markets. And in a sign that persistent economic challenges are still impacting some parts of M&A, the number of deals being announced globally remains flat. Many small and mid-cap companies have lagged the broader stock market and are opting to pursue their own strategic plans instead of weighing inorganic options, according to Jake Henry, global co-leader of the M&A practice at consultancy McKinsey & Co. “They’re thinking ‘I’m better off just operating my business and getting there.’ It has to be an explosive offer for them to come to the table,” he said. Meanwhile, private equity firms, whose buying and selling is a key barometer for M&A, are still having a harder time offloading certain assets because of valuation gaps with buyers. This has had a knock-on effect on their ability to raise funds and spend on new acquisitions. But bankers are starting to see a recovery here too as interest rates come down and bring more potential acquirers to the table. “What’s motivating sponsors more than anything is their need to return cash to investors,” said Saba Nazar, chair of global financial sponsors at Bank of America Corp. “We have been in bake-off frenzy for the last couple of months.” Dealmakers began the year whispering of M&A records under Trump’s pro-business administration. While they will just miss out on the milestone in 2025, there is a strong sense on Wall Street that those early bumps only delayed the inevitable. Brian Link, co-head of North America M&A at Citigroup Inc., said that after ‘Liberation Day’ in April, he expected to spend more time figuring out the impact of tariffs on different business and how to adjust around that. “That has not been the case,” he said. “Unless fear creeps back into the market, there doesn’t seem to be anything in the near term that’s going to change the dynamic here.”

Title: PME Pensioenfonds Terminates $5.9B BlackRock Mandate
URL: https://www.ai-cio.com/news/pme-pensioenfonds-terminates-5-9b-blackrock-mandate/
Time Published: 2025-12-15T21:19:51Z
Full Content:
PME Pensioenfonds, a Dutch pension fund with $70 billion in assets, has terminated a $5.9 billion equity mandate with BlackRock due to the manager’s misalignment with the fund’s environmental, social and governance framework, the fund announced on Monday. According to the release, PME began reviewing its relationship with BlackRock as early as January, following the firm’s departure from the Net-Zero Asset Managers Initiative, a collective of asset managers who sought to achieve net-zero portfolio emissions by 2050. The initiative paused operations following the departure of BlackRock, which was among the most prominent asset managers to leave. “As part of our strategy to invest for a good pension, we make deliberate choices about the companies included in our equity portfolio,” PME’s announcement stated. “We aim for a portfolio with a limited number of stocks, enabling us to better understand our investments and pursue an improved balance between risk, return, and sustainability. Implementing this strategy also means we carefully select and evaluate our external asset managers.” In 2022, PME began defining its ESG goals, evolving the goals into an ESG framework and later an ESG index portfolio it called the portfolio of tomorrow, in which “every company is selected based on deliberate choices aimed at achieving solid returns and supporting a living world,” PME stated. Never miss a story — sign up for CIO newsletters to stay up-to-date on the latest institutional investment industry news.  Following PME’s evaluation of BlackRock, the pension fund decided to end its relationship with the $11.5 trillion asset manager. “BlackRock has provided PME with high-quality services for many years in managing part of our equity portfolio,” PME stated. “We value that collaboration and the contribution they have made in managing our investments. However, PME also considers which external managers best align with our vision and the principles of the Portfolio of Tomorrow.” Going forward, PME will only rely on two asset managers to manage its equity investments—UBS Global Asset Management and MN, an investment manager based in The Hague, Netherlands. The move to two managers for the equity portfolio also will lower the pension fund’s costs, according to PME. “BlackRock has been entrusted by clients in the Netherlands and around the world to manage more sustainable and transition assets than any other asset manager. These clients see us as their partner of choice for achieving their investment goals, including their net zero objectives,” a BlackRock spokesperson wrote via email. “We manage more than €350 billion in total for our Dutch clients and are proud of our continued growth in the country. We are grateful for the opportunity to have served PME and its members for more than a decade.” PME is the latest European allocator to terminate a mandate due to ESG misalignment. PFZW, the Dutch pension fund for the care and welfare sector, terminated BlackRock—as well as AQR Capital Management LLC and Legal & General Investment Management—in September. In March, AkademikerPension, the Danish pension for academics, terminated a 3.2-billion-Danish-Krone ($503 million) mandate with State Street due to ESG misalignment, and U.K.-based defined contribution master trust The People’s Pension terminated a 28-billion-pound ($37.42 billion) mandate, also with State Street, due to misalignment with the pension fund’s sustainable investing policy, awarding the business to Invesco and Amundi. The termination of these European mandates showcases the tightrope that asset managers like BlackRock must walk regarding ESG factors—some investors and lawmakers deem BlackRock to be uncommitted to ESG goals, while others have criticized the firm for the opposite reason. In the U.S., the manager has lost mandates, including a fixed-income mandate from the Indiana Public Retirement System, due to its ESG commitment. “PME’s decision reinforces a clear shift in how asset owners are responding to climate risk,” said Alasdair Docherty, a sustainable finance and data analyst at the Norway-based Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, in a statement. “Large pension funds increasingly see climate change not as a moral issue but as a systemic financial threat to long-term portfolio values, and they expect their managers to act accordingly.” In November, New York City Comptroller Brad Lander called for the city’s $308.3 billion pension system to drop BlackRock, Fidelity and PanAgora Asset Management for failing to meet the system’s climate expectations from its managers. “Stewardship failures are now being treated as a material mandate risk,” Docherty continued in his statement. “For asset managers, particularly in the U.S., retreating from climate stewardship may once have felt like the path of least resistance, offering short-term relief from political and commercial pressure. Increasingly, that looks less like pragmatism and more like a strategic miscalculation.” Related Stories: Dutch Pension PZFW Terminates BlackRock, AQR, L&G Mandates Amidst Portfolio Reshuffle NYC Comptroller Calls for City Pensions to Drop BlackRock, Fidelity, PanAgora BlackRock AUM Surges Past $13T, Alts Investments Double Tags: BlackRock, PME Pensioenfonds « Trump Issues Executive Order Seeking to Curb Proxy Advisers’ Influence

Title: Anchorage Digital deepens RIA market push by acquiring unit of Securitize

The deal folds adviser-facing tools into Anchorage’s platform while allowing Securitize to remain focused on tokenizing real-world assets. Anchorage Digital, a federally chartered digital asset bank, acquired Securitize’s investment adviser platform as it seeks to expand its reach among institutional investors amid the growing adoption of digital assets. Anchorage announced on Monday that it has completed the acquisition of Securitize For Advisors (SFA), a lesser-known unit of Securitize, a company best known for tokenizing real-world assets. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. SFA is designed for registered investment advisers (RIAs); before the acquisition, it already relied on Anchorage for custody of client assets. By bringing the adviser platform in-house, Anchorage consolidates custody, trading and adviser-facing tools within a single platform, rather than operating across separate systems. Anchorage is an institutional crypto platform that operates a federally chartered digital asset bank in the United States. In March, it was selected by Cantor Fitzgerald as a custody partner for Bitcoin (BTC). For Securitize, the sale enables the company to focus more on its core tokenization business, according to Carlos Domingo, the company’s CEO. Securitize has been accelerating its real-world asset strategy and is moving forward with plans to go public through a special purpose acquisition company sponsored by Cantor Fitzgerald. In May of last year, it raised $47 million in a funding round led by BlackRock. Securitize is behind BlackRock’s tokenized money market fund, known as BUIDL. Related: Anchorage Digital adds HYPE staking support through Figment partnership Nathan McCauley, co-founder and chief executive of Anchorage Digital, said registered investment advisers are “driving one of the most important waves of crypto adoption,” likely referring to growing institutional adoption of digital assets through spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) RIA involvement has been building for several years. Momentum began to shift in 2020, when the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency allowed federally chartered banks to custody digital assets, giving advisers a compliant pathway to gain exposure. Broader participation followed the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024, which lowered operational and regulatory hurdles for advisers and accelerated mainstream access. The funds align with existing RIA infrastructure, including broker-dealers and custodians, making allocation easier for institutional investors. Even after early adoption, RIAs still control access to sizable portions of the market that have yet to enter the digital assets space. “The reason that we’re here today is because of the retail channels adopting crypto ETFs and crypto more broadly,” Federico Brokate, an executive at crypto issuer 21Shares, told Cointelegraph. “The next category is RIAs, and this is where we need to see the majority of ETF flow over the next five years.” Related: SEC staff gives guidance on how securities laws could apply to crypto Cointelegraph is committed to providing independent, high-quality journalism across the crypto, blockchain, AI, and fintech industries.

Title: Anchorage Digital Acquires Securitize Platform in Major Crypto Wealth Management Consolidation

© 2025 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Anchorage Digital has acquired the Securitize For Advisors platform, strengthening its position in crypto wealth management for registered investment advisors as both firms pursue distinct institutional strategies. The first federally chartered crypto bank in the US, Anchorage Digital, has acquired the Securitize For Advisors (SFA) platform from tokenization specialist Securitize, tightening its grip on the growing market for crypto wealth management tools aimed at registered investment advisors (RIAs). The move comes as Anchorage ramps up its regulated stablecoin and custody business, while Securitize doubles down on large-scale tokenization and public-market plans. The company is taking over SFA, a crypto wealth management platform built for RIAs that has grown deposits and assets under management more than 4,500% over the past 12 months, according to their announcement. The business already had 99% of client assets custodied at Anchorage Digital Bank, making the acquisition a consolidation of an existing relationship rather than a new strategic bet. More details about the terms were not disclosed. A meaningful expansion of Anchorage Digital’s wealth management offering: Anchorage Digital has acquired the Securitize for Advisors business unit from @Securitize, expanding our wealth management capabilities with SFA’s platform, vision, and team. pic.twitter.com/q3cQHMpzir — Anchorage Digital (@Anchorage) December 15, 2025 The SFA acquisition comes in a year when Anchorage has stepped up activity around regulated stablecoins, such as USDtb and USDGO, additional asset support, and infrastructure partnerships. The firm recently moved to expand its custody universe by adding support for 25 additional digital assets for institutional clients, while maintaining a valuation above $3 billion from its last round. On the product side, Anchorage is building out stablecoin operations and institutional DeFi access, including work on Genius Act-compliant stablecoins and integrations that enable clients to tap on-chain liquidity in a regulated environment. The firm is also launching Anchorage Digital Ventures, a new venture arm targeting Bitcoin BTC $86 562 24h volatility: 0.6% Market cap: $1.73 T Vol. 24h: $43.12 B DeFi, real-world assets (RWAs), and decentralized identity projects that fit its institutional client base. All of this sits on top of its status as the only crypto-native firm with a federal banking charter and key licenses, including New York’s BitLicense. For Securitize, selling SFA allows management to refocus on its core business of bringing real-world assets on-chain. The company reports more than $4 billion in tokenized assets under management and works with managers including Apollo, BlackRock, Hamilton Lane, and KKR to issue tokenized funds and private credit products. In January, Securitize and Apollo rolled out the ACRED tokenized private credit fund across multiple chains, using Wormhole as an interoperability layer to move assets between networks. Regulatory expansion has become central to Securitize’s strategy. The firm recently secured full regulatory approval to operate a tokenized securities trading and settlement platform in the European Union, positioning it as the only player running licensed tokenization infrastructure in both the US and EU. Securitize now plans to go public via a SPAC deal at a $1.25 billion valuation and has indicated it will tokenize its own equity as part of the process. The Anchorage-SFA combination gives RIAs a more direct, regulated path into digital assets, with one provider covering custody, execution, and front-end tools under a federal banking charter. This move could simplify compliance and operational risk management for advisory firms that have so far relied on fragmented service providers or avoided crypto allocations altogether.

President Donald Trump weighs in on foreign relations during a presser at the White House. President Donald Trump has directed U.S. officials to help to facilitate a "lasting and durable peace" between Ukraine and Russia, with officials touting the "very, very strong" package presented for negotiations in Berlin over the weekend. Fox News Digital participated in a briefing with U.S. officials Monday morning to discuss ongoing discussions in Berlin with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, his team, and European security officials. ZELENSKYY VISITS FRONTLINE UKRAINIAN CITY WEEKS AFTER RUSSIA CLAIMED IT TOOK CONTROL U.S. officials met with Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian delegation Sunday for nearly six hours, and spent more than two hours with them Monday.

(Pavlo Bahmut/Ukrinform/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Officials said Trump’s goal is to "stop the Russians from moving west." "President Trump's very focused on reaching a conclusion to this conflict that really stops the Russians from from moving west," one official said. "Under President Bush, Russia moved west. Under President Obama, Russia moved west. Under President Biden, Russia move west. President Trump really wants to see this as an agreement that ends that, for good." Officials also discussed the economic situation for Ukraine, noting that asset manager BlackRock has assembled a team, pro bono, to begin working on the matter, in coordination with the World Bank. "We went extensively through all the different financial borders that Ukraine currently faces," an official said. "What President Trump is trying to do is to save Ukraine as a country and make sure that they then have the ability to be, from a military perspective, security perspective, and then make sure that they can become viable." The official said the Europeans involved in discussions expressed "several times that they see Ukraine as critical for their security," and that they "need Ukraine to be financially viable and strong in order for it to be a good partner."

(Vyacheslav Prokofyev, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP) But the officials said that "security guarantees were the major focus of the discussions." "It was a very specific, palpable conversation around how to deter any further incursions and to punish — or address — any further incursions," an official said. "I think Ukrainians would tell you, as will the Europeans, that this is the most robust set of security protocols they have ever seen." EUROPEAN TALKS RESHAPE UKRAINE’S PEACE PLAN AS ZELENSKYY REFUSES TERRITORIAL CONCESSIONS The official touted the current package as "very, very strong." "Hopefully the Russians are going to look at it and say to themselves, that’s okay, because we have no intention of violating it," the official continued. "But violations are going to be addressed with this security package." The official added: "The Europeans now know that we mean business, and the Ukrainians know it too." The package will ensure "oversight" and "deconfliction," along with "anything that will make the Ukrainian people feel safe." "It’s just that strong," the official said. Officials said that the basis of the agreement is to have "really, really strong Article Five guarantees." Officials said that President Donald Trump has been "very, very clear" that he is "not looking to put pressure on Ukraine." (Al Drago/Reuters) "We believe the Russians, in a final deal, will accept all these things which will allow for a strong and free Ukraine," an official said. "Russia has indicated they would be open to Ukraine joining the E.U., which would be, I think, the biggest expansion of the Euro-free zone since the Berlin Wall — this would be two huge wins for them." Officials said that Trump has been "very, very clear" that he is "not looking to put pressure on Ukraine." "He has done his best to help define these issues and whatever decision they ultimately make on their territorial issues around these other outstanding issues will be up to them," the official said. UKRAINE'S ZELENSKYY YET TO READ PEACE PLAN, TRUMP SAYS Meanwhile, the officials touted the conversations with the European community, specifically the Germans, the English, and the French. "I can’t say enough good things about them," one official said. "Everyone has been dug in to end this conflict. Hopefully we are on the path to peace." Another official said this is a "full U.S.-European effort to try to come up with the strongest package possible in order to see if we can go back to Russia with something that can close this out." The official added that President Donald Trump’s focus on the deal has been to ensure "robust security so that this war really ends and that this will not happen again." (Yuri Gripas/Abaca/Bloomberg via Getty Images) The official added that Trump’s focus on the deal has been to ensure "robust security so that this war really ends and that this will not happen again" and to reach an agreement to deal with "all of the economic issues for Ukraine so that they have a bright and prosperous future." The official also said Trump hopes that Russia can "get back into the global economy so that they have incentive not to go back to war in the future." The U.S. officials said Monday conversations are ongoing, but touted the "multiple different solutions" they have presented that can "bridge the gap between the parties." CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP "We have moved considerably closer in narrowing the issues between the Ukrainians and the Russians," one official said. "It is a really good faith effort." "Are we prepared to go to Russia if needed? Absolutely. Are we prepared to go to Ukraine if needed? Absolutely," the official said. "We are under instructions to do what it takes to help facilitate, on behalf of President Trump, a lasting and durable peace between Ukraine and the Russian Federation," the official continued.

Title: MSC Emerges as ‘Leading Contender’ to Acquire ZIM, Report Says
URL: https://sourcingjournal.com/topics/logistics/msc-zim-leading-contender-bid-hapag-lloyd-acquisition-takeover-israel-mediterranean-shipping-company-1234794026/
Time Published: 2025-12-15T19:22:43Z
Full Content:
By Glenn Taylor Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) is reportedly in the mix to be the new owner of container shipping competitor ZIM. According to a report from Israeli business publication Calcalist, the world’s largest ocean carrier submitted a bid to ZIM’s board of directors to acquire the fellow shipping company. A previous report from another Israeli publication, Globes, said MSC had expressed interest in an acquisition while indicating that another major carrier, Hapag-Lloyd, had put in its own bid. Hapag-Lloyd has never confirmed the report. The Calcalist called MSC, the “leading contender” for the bid. Last month, ZIM’s board of directors confirmed that it put the company under strategic review after rejecting a prior takeover over from a group co-led by CEO Eli Glickman. The board is currently undergoing a proxy fight, with a minority investor group aiming to replace three board directors. Sourcing Journal reached out to MSC. MSC and ZIM already have a slot-swapping and vessel-sharing partnership, launching their own trans-Pacific cooperation in February. Under that three-year partnership, the carriers share vessels across six weekly services between Asia and the U.S. East and Gulf Coasts, with some stops at select Mexican and Caribbean ports. ZIM also had a prior arrangement with MSC from Asia to the Pacific Northwest. The ZIM North Pacific line stops at Yantian, Shanghai and Qingdao in China, and then South Korea’s Port of Busan, before crossing the Pacific Ocean to reach Canada’s Port of Vancouver. Related Stories Topics EU Scrutinizes MSC's Planned Stake in Barcelona Port Terminal Topics US Navy Taps Palantir to Speed Up Shipbuilding With AI 'Ship OS' ZIM’s shares increased nearly 6 percent in Monday morning trading on the report. MSC has more container-carrying capacity than any other ocean carrier, with its estimated 967 vessels able to transport nearly 7.1 million 20-foot equivalent units (TEUs), according to container shipping research database Alphaliner. That makes up a 21.3 percent of total market share by TEU. ZIM, on the other hand, carries the 10th most capacity at 704,000 TEUs, a 2.1 percent share of the fleet. Neither of the companies are part of the three major vessel-sharing alliances—the Ocean Alliance, the Premier Alliance and the Gemini Cooperation. A sale of ZIM is likely to have some barriers despite the board’s strategic review. ZIM’s workers’ committee clamored for Israel’s Transportation Minister Miri Regev to block the Hapag-Lloyd sale after the Globes report came out. The employees argue that foreign control could endanger Israel’s supply chain and potential national security in the event of another war. The committee’s main concern is that 98 percent of Israel’s trade goes by sea, with the workers harping that ZIM was the only ocean carrier that stopped at the country’s ports regularly throughout its war with Hamas. Selling to Hapag-Lloyd set off bells and whistles for the committee, given that the state investment wings of the Qatari and Saudi Arabian governments collectively own more than 20 percent of the German shipping company. MSC is privately owned, with the majority of shares held by the Italy-based Aponte family. While the ownership group doesn’t have ties to countries with tenuous relationships with Israel, any potential foreign buyer is still going to generate scrutiny. Israel’s government has a “golden share” in ZIM, which is likely to play a role in any potential transaction to a foreign entity. This mechanism is designed to protect the country’s interests in private companies deemed essential for national security and transportation. The provision gives the government veto powers over potential acquisitions if more than 24 percent of the company is sold. With its golden share, the government requires ZIM to have a majority-Israeli board, an Israeli chairman and a fleet of 11 ships available for state use in emergencies. According to the Calcalist report, ZIM employees are also concerned about potential layoffs should a foreign buyer acquire the company and consider relocating its headquarters abroad. The rumors also come as MSC is seeking to push through a $23 billion proposed acquisition of 43 ports worldwide from Hong Kong-based port operator CK Hutchison. The shipping company is partnering with BlackRock in the deal, but it is still hanging in regulatory limbo due to various contentions from China and Panama. That deal would shift two critical ports on the opposite sides of the Panama Canal under MSC’s ownership, which Panama Canal officials argue could put its operating neutrality at risk due to heavy concentration under one carrier. China has held the deal up under antitrust review, and has held gripes with a U.S. entity having control over the Panama Ports.

BlackRock is ramping up its digital asset strategy with a wave of new hires aimed at expanding its crypto and blockchain-related products globally, amid growing institutional interest in tokenized and onchain assets. In a job posting board, the $10 trillion asset manager said it is hiring for seven digital asset positions, six based in the United States and one in Singapore. The move follows BlackRock's head of digital assets, Robert Mitchnick, posting about the open roles on LinkedIn last week. One of the positions in the U.S. focuses on expanding BlackRock’s iShares digital asset ETF lineup. The "Vice President/Director, Digital Assets Product Strategist" job listing seeks a candidate to scale existing products, including its crypto ETFs, and help extend them to institutional and wealth management clients. Currently, BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has $70 billion in assets under management. The same role also mentions building “next generation products with strong commercial appeal,” pointing to the firm's ambition to go beyond traditional investment wrappers. The Singapore-based role is more expansive. There, BlackRock is looking for a leader to shape its digital asset strategy across Asia, where regulatory clarity and demand from institutional investors are accelerating. The job involves setting commercial targets and identifying “first-mover big bets” in the region that align with global priorities. A multi-year business plan is part of the brief. The hiring push adds to BlackRock’s growing presence in crypto markets. The firm made headlines last year with the launch of its spot bitcoin ETF, which helped drive record flows into crypto investment vehicles. Beyond ETFs, the firm is also expanding its asset tokenization strategy. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has spoken publicly about the potential of tokenized assets to modernize capital markets by increasing transparency and settlement efficiency. Last year, it launched a tokenized fund on the Ethereum blockchain and has invested in infrastructure providers, such as Securitize, to explore how public blockchains can support regulated financial products. A representative for BlackRock could not be reached for comment. CORRECTION (Dec. 15, 20:48 UTC): Corrects headline and story throughout to clarify details of BlackRock's search for candidates in crypto roles.

Title: JPMorgan launches new crypto fund for wealthy investors — after Jamie Dimon called bitcoin a ‘fraud’ and ‘Ponzi scheme’
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/12/15/business/jpmorgan-launches-new-crypto-fund-for-wealthy-investors/
Time Published: 2025-12-15T17:23:08Z
Full Content:
JPMorgan Chase — whose CEO Jamie Dimon once dismissed bitcoin as a “fraud” and likened cryptocurrencies to a “Ponzi scheme” — is diving further into crypto with a money-market fund that’s based on blockchain. The bank’s asset-management division, which handles $4 trillion, will start the Wall Street giant’s first tokenized money-market fund — this one on the Ethereum network — with $100 million of its own money, the Wall Street Journal reported. The fund — called the My OnChain Net Yield Fund, or MONY — will be opened to outside investors on Tuesday, but it’s not aimed at the masses: The minimum investment is $1 million, and individuals need at least $5 million in investments to qualify. Institutions need at least $25 million. A money-market fund is like a safe savings option that invests in short-term debts from governments or companies, earning a bit more interest than a regular bank account. A fund is referred to as “tokenized” when those assets are turned into digital tokens on a blockchain, a giant online record-keeping system that does not need a central bank or company to manage it. Ethereum is one of the main blockchain networks. Investors can buy into the fund through JPMorgan’s online portal and get digital tokens in their crypto wallets, which are like digital storage for online money. They can use cash or USDC, a stablecoin that holds a steady value tied to the US dollar, issued by Circle Internet Group. The fund pays interest and dividends daily, just like traditional ones. This move comes after the Genius Act passed earlier this year, setting rules for stablecoins and sparking more tokenization of stocks, bonds, funds, and real estate. “There is a massive amount of interest from clients around tokenization,” John Donohue, head of global liquidity at JPMorgan Asset Management, told the Journal. “And we expect to be a leader in this space and work with clients to make sure that we have a product lineup that allows them to have the choices that we have in traditional money-market funds on blockchain.” Money-market funds have grown popular, with total assets at about $7.7 trillion now, up from $6.9 trillion at the start of 2025, according to the Investment Company Institute. Stablecoins have a market value of over $300 billion, according to data compiled by CoinGecko. Tokenized funds appeal to crypto users because they earn yields while staying fully on the blockchain, avoiding idle cash in stablecoins that do not pay interest. For managers, it reduces costs and speeds up deals. Some funds serve as collateral on crypto exchanges, helping to attract new clients to digital assets. JPMorgan’s move highlights a shift in its approach to digital assets, despite past criticisms from Dimon, its long-serving chief executive.

In January 2023, he called bitcoin “a hyped-up fraud, it’s a pet rock,” and once branded crypto tokens “decentralized Ponzi schemes.” The veteran banker has said blockchain technology itself is real and useful, separate from cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Other firms are doing similar things. BlackRock runs the biggest tokenized money fund with over $1.8 billion. In July, Goldman Sachs and Bank of New York Mellon teamed up to create tokens for funds from BlackRock, Fidelity, and others. JPMorgan recently tokenized a private-equity fund for rich clients. Companies like Robinhood, Kraken, and Gemini launched tokenized stocks and exchange-traded funds for investors outside the U.S. earlier this year. Advertisement

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. JPMorgan is set to offer clients access to a tokenized money market fund as part of Wall Street's latest crypto push. The bank announced that its asset management arm will launch a tokenized money-market fund that will run on the ethereum blockchain. My OnChain Net Yield Fund (MONY) will be supported by Kinexys Digital Assets, the bank's tokenization platform. MONY will hold short-term debt and issue daily interest payouts in the same way traditional money market funds do. The key difference lies in the fact that its shares will exist on the ethereum blockchain network, and investors can redeem them using either cash or the USDC stablecoin. The new fund, which The Wall Street Journal reported will be offered to wealthy clients and institutions, will have a minimum investment of $1 million. Its launch is the latest crypto move from the bank, which also recently tokenized some private equity investments in October. It's also the latest crypto push from Wall Street broadly. Asset management titans, including Franklin Templeton, Fidelity, and BlackRock, have also been offering crypto investments and blockchain solutions for clients. JPMorgan will commit $100 million of its own capital to the fund before officially opening it up to investors on December 16. Despite some skepticism from CEO Jamie Dimon over the years, the bank has made inroads into crypto and has been recently bullish on the price of bitcoin. JPMorgan analysts said recently that bitcoin could buck its latest downtrend and reach $170,000 in 2026. Asset tokenization has been in focus in 2025, with platforms like Robinhood framing it as a means of trading more efficiently or potentially gaining exposure to private investments. The passing of the GENIUS Act, meanwhile, has offered support for stablecoins, a key component for tokenized funds like MONY. Jump to

Title: Trump could announce a new Fed chair before Christmas: Here’s what you need to know about the leading candidates
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/12/15/fed-chairman-candidates-hassett-warsh-waller-rieder/
Time Published: 2025-12-15T16:08:21Z
Full Content:
The White House has run a very public campaign for the nomination of the next chairman of the Federal Reserve. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has been open about how swiftly he would like to see a name chosen and shared with the public, while President Trump has been transparent about the individuals in contention. One motivation for the candor is a bid to shift focus away from current chairman Jerome Powell, who has grated on the Oval Office by refusing to cut rates as fast as Trump might have liked.With this in mind, Bessent in particular has lobbied to announce the Fed nomination sooner rather than later, even saying the announcement could be made before Christmas. With 10 days to go, that now seems unlikely, and the president has indicated the decision will instead be made in early 2026.Even over the weekend, The Wall Street Journal reported Trump is eyeing two candidates in particular—Kevin Hassett and Kevin Warsh—for the job. Here’s what you need to know about the top contenders, and what their on-record opinions have been about the running of the Fed. Kevin Hassett has been seen broadly as the frontrunner in this race. As director of the White House National Economic Council (NEC), Hassett claims he speaks with President Trump daily, and his appointment to the NEC suggests that Trump already values his outlook. Hassett knows how to work with politicians, particularly Trump. From 2017 to 2019 he served as chairman of the president’s Council of Economic Advisors, and then was enlisted by the White House to serve as a senior advisor on the coronavirus pandemic. He has also worked with a roster of Republican politicians, serving as John McCain’s chief economic advisor in 2000, adviser to George W. Bush in 2004, and to Mitt Romney in 2012. The conservative economist has also worked within the Fed before, in the 1990s, though not in decision-making or senior positions, unlike some of his rivals. Hassett’s allegiance to the White House raises questions for investors, who generally prefer central banks that are firmly independent of politics. Like his peers, Hassett has expressed a dovish outlook on rates, which aligns with President Trump’s way of thinking. The economist has also said he would take the views of the Oval Office directly to the Fed, while maintaining that it won’t sway the internal due diligence of the institution. Speaking on Face the Nation yesterday, Hassett said: “I think he has very strong and well-founded views about what we ought to do. “But in the end, the job of the Fed is to be independent and to work with the group of people that are on the Board of Governors, at the FOMC, to drive a group consensus on where interest rates should be … with the guidance of the Fed chair. But in the end, it’s a committee that votes. “And I’d be happy to talk to the president every day … until both of us are dead because it’s so much fun to talk.” Previously, Hassett led polls by a significant margin according to odds site Kalshi. However, in recent days, he has lost some of that steam and now sits at a 50% likelihood. Picking up steam is Kevin Warsh, who now sits at odds of 40% on Kalshi. Warsh has experience that spans the private sector, Capitol Hill, and senior roles within the Federal Reserve. The Stanford alumnus began his professional career at Morgan Stanley in 1995, before leaving in 2002 to serve in the administration of President George W. Bush. Bush then nominated Warsh to the Fed’s Board of Governors in 2006. During this term, the Harvard alumnus served as the Board’s representative to the Group of Twenty (G-20) and as an emissary to the emerging and advanced economies in Asia. Warsh left the Fed in 2011 and since then has served as a board member to UPS and Coupang, as well as acting as economic advisor to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). He is also a partner at Duquesne Family Office, the family office of legendary investor Stanley Druckenmiller. Warsh is, like Hassett, dovish—but does not have the perception of being so closely linked with the White House. He made his differences with the Fed clear before his name was touted chairman. Explaining his position in a WSJ op-ed last month, Warsh argued that “AI will be a significant disinflationary force” and that “inflation is a choice, and the Fed’s track record under Chairman Jerome Powell is one of unwise choices. The Fed should re-examine its great mistakes that led to the great inflation. It should abandon the dogma that inflation is caused when the economy grows too much and workers get paid too much.” He added: “The Fed is an institution whose reach has extended far beyond its grasp. Fundamental reform of monetary and regulatory policy would unlock the benefits of AI to all Americans. The economy would be stronger. Living standards would be higher. Inflation would fall further. And the Fed will have contributed to a new golden age.” With the above in mind, Warsh wants to pull the Fed toward the “backseat” role that Treasury Secretary Bessent has recently begun lobbying for. On the sidelines of the IMF earlier this year, Warsh reportedly said: “The central bank should find new comfort in working without applause and without the audience at the edge of its seats.” Chris Waller is a familiar face to markets as he is a current member of the Fed’s board, beginning in December 2020 and ending in 2030. Governor Waller’s name began circulating as a candidate given his departure from consensus voting on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) earlier this year, advocating the more dovish route, which Trump said would be necessary to secure a nomination. Waller has also been optimistic about Trump’s policies, which may impact monetary policy, for example, saying the effect of tariffs has been “small so far.” While Waller is a distinguished academic analysts have questioned whether the White House’s attention to Waller stems largely from his dissent from the wait-and-see stance of the Fed more broadly. Back in July, when Waller and fellow Governor Michelle Bowman (also briefly seen by some as a potential chair) dissented from a decision to hold the base rate, UBS’s Paul Donovan observed: “Fed Chair Powell tried to present the two dissenting views as being rationally based, but investors are bound to suspect that the rationale amounted to little more than an excited jumping up and down and shouting ‘pick me, pick me’ in the general direction of the White House.” Waller currently has Kalshi odds of 6%. Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of Global Fixed Income at BlackRock, is an outsider also on the list of candidates. Rieder has had a successful career in the private sector, including a stint at Lehman Brothers between 1987 and 2008, as R3 Capital Partners’ CEO and President, and is now responsible for managing $2.4 trillion at BlackRock. Rieder has gained exposure to public sector bodies, having served as vice chairman of the Borrowing Committee for the U.S. Treasury and as a member of the Fed’s Investment Advisory Committee on Financial Markets. The exec’s odds aren’t great, sitting at 2%—that’s behind even Scott Bessent, who has repeatedly said he doesn’t want the job, both publicly and to President Trump himself. Of course, investors have been surprised by President Trump before, so the odds must be taken with a pinch of salt. Rieder has been saying what the Oval Office wants to hear, continually advocating for rate cuts this year and arguing the economy is approaching normalcy. Rieder hasn’t been as outspoken in his criticism of the Fed—or its leadership and past decisions—as some of the other candidates vying for the job, but has shared a bullish view on the economy, which coincides with Trump’s calls for cuts. What may have piqued the attention of Fed supporters is that Reider has previously warned analysts against viewing the Fed as a safety net, which purists will appreciate, given the argument that the Fed should focus on its mandate rather than financial markets. Back in 2020, Rieder told the Long View podcast: “I think [the Fed has] been amazingly thoughtful about how they’ve addressed these markets, and being thoughtful and innovative about how they do it. But I don’t believe in the thesis away from Treasuries and mortgages that you just follow the Fed willy-nilly, because the Fed is not trying to move prices in a certain area, certainly not in credit.” He continued: “I hear it all the time, where people say, “You know, I’m buying (for example) investment-grade credit”–which by the way, we’re buying as well but in a slightly different way. But people say, “Gosh, if the Fed is in that, they are going to make sure that market holds up well.” I’m not sure I really believe that … I think there is too much overzealousness that, gosh, I’m going to be okay as long as the Fed is there without doing the credit work. I hear it all the time.”

Title: Dame Dash FULLY Broke … They’re Auctioning Off His ‘Media Empire’!

Time Published: 2025-12-15T15:43:21Z

Damon Dash’s long, painful financial unraveling just hit another brutal chapter. Media Take Out has learned that Dash is set to watch his film catalog go up for auction in New York City on December 30, 2025, as two states line up to grab whatever money they can from his massive bankruptcy case. A federal judge has authorized the U.S. Marshals Service to auction off copyrights tied to Poppington LLC, Damon Dash’s media company. That means films like Honor Up, Too Honorable, and Welcome to Blackrock are officially headed to the chopping block. The order comes after years of legal drama, unpaid judgments, and mounting debt that finally caught up with the Roc-A-Fella cofounder. The auction will start with a minimum bid of $300,000, though the final price could climb depending on interest. One of the most notable titles is Honor Up, which was executive produced by Kanye West and starred Dash himself alongside Cam’ron and Stacy Dash. Once seen as a passion project, the film is now just another asset being liquidated. Dash filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in September, listing more than $25 million in liabilities and a jaw dropping $4,350 in assets. His debts include roughly $19 million in unpaid taxes, nearly $400,000 in back child and spousal support, and multiple civil judgments that have followed him for more than a decade. While bankruptcy is usually meant to pause collections, the court ruled that assets already seized by the Marshals were fair game. That cleared the way for the auction to move forward. Both New York and New Jersey are now aggressively trying to collect. New Jersey filed a secured claim for nearly $4 million, backed by a statutory lien on all of Dash’s property and earning over 10 percent interest. New York came in even harder, filing a claim for more than $8.6 million in unpaid income taxes. Both states positioned themselves early so they can get paid first from whatever money the auction brings in. Creditors like filmmaker Josh Webber also hold serious leverage. They can submit a “credit bid,” meaning they could claim the film rights in exchange for the money Dash already owes them. If that happens, other creditors could be left with nothing. Webber already scored big once before. Back in November 2024, Dash lost his one third stake in Roc-A-Fella Records after failing to pay an $823,000 judgment to Webber over the film Dear Frank. That auction ended with a $1 million winning bid from a representative of New York State, which used the purchase to chip away at Dash’s massive tax bill. Once hailed as one of hip hop’s sharpest business minds, Damon Dash is now watching his legacy assets get sold piece by piece to satisfy debts. And with two states and multiple creditors circling, December 30 could mark one of the final dismantlings of what used to be a hip hop empire. Tags ·Dame Dash

The private fund, dubbed My OnChain Net Yield Fund, or “MONY,” will be seeded with $100 million of the bank’s capital before it can be accessed on Tuesday by individuals with at least $5 million in assets or institutions with $25 million or more, the bank said. MONY, which requires an investment of at least $1 million, represents JPMorgan’s continued experimentation with digital assets, following the debut of its Kinexys Digital Assets platform a year ago. JPMorgan said its MONY fund is available on its Morgan Money platform. The bank said investors are able to earn a yield while holding the fund’s associated token on-chain, mirroring the functionality of BlackRock’s “BUIDL” fund. When BlackRock debuted its $1.8 billion fund last March, the Wall Street heavyweight also tapped Ethereum. JPMorgan said that the debut of its MONY fund underscores “the industry’s growing shift toward tokenization of assets on public networks,” noting that money-market funds have historically provided investors with liquidity and stability, in addition to yield. In a statement, John Donohue, head of global liquidity at JPMorgan Asset Management, said that the bank expects other Globally Systemically Important Banks (or G-SIBs) “to follow our lead in providing clients with greater optionality in how they invest in money market funds.” BlackRock’s BUIDL fund is available on eight different networks, including Solana, according to data provider RWA.xyz. The fund’s ability to operate across multiple blockchains is enabled by tokenization specialist Securitize and interoperability protocol Wormhole. Franklin Templeton debuted the first mutual fund on-chain in 2021, which is called the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund. In addition to Ethereum and some layer-2 scaling networks, Franklin Templeton’s fund is available on Avalanche, Stellar, and Aptos. JPMorgan has made a series of announcements with regards to an expanding line on crypto-focused products in recent weeks. Last month, it proposed structured notes tied to Bitcoin’s price, while reportedly debuting a deposit token on Coinbase’s Base. Although the bank’s latest was aimed at Ethereum’s ecosystem, the JPMorgan recent activity suggests a multi-chain approach. For example, the bank recently arranged the issuance of commercial paper on Solana on behalf of institutional crypto firm Galaxy Digital.

Title: Most Influential: Pavel Durov
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2025/12/15/most-influential-pavel-durov
Time Published: 2025-12-15T15:00:00Z
Full Content:
As CEO of billion-user messaging app Telegram, Pavel Durov may stand as the most pivotal figure in bona fide mass adoption of cryptocurrency for many observers. This feature is a part of CoinDesk's Most Influential 2025 list. By embedding the wallet for the TON blockchain into its popular messaging app, Telegram aims to remove some of the most cumbersome elements of interacting with crypto, such as remembering seed phrases and registering on an exchange. In short, Durov wants to make Telegram the biggest mass-market crypto on-ramp, offering digital asset services through an interface that's as simple as sending a message. In 2025, Telegram garnered attention from no less a prospective investor than the world's largest asset manager, BlackRock. Telegram raised $1.7 billion via convertible bonds in a tender offer, which closed in late May, that drew the interest of investors including BlackRock, Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth fund Mubadala and hedge fund Citadel. Durov is known as a staunch advocate of privacy and free speech, which formed part of his motivation for the creation of Telegram in 2014. However, his reputation sometimes precedes him when it comes to law enforcement agencies. In August of 2024, French authorities confiscated his passport and imposed a travel ban on him following preliminary charges related to complicity in drug trafficking, money laundering and fraud through Telegram. When he recovered his passport in March this year, the TON token jumped 20% on the news. While Durov and Telegram, in general, may remain controversial, according to some observers, 2025 also saw the app demonstrate a determination to crack down on unlawful use of its platform, which would otherwise tarnish it with the brush of crime, fraud, and so on. This year, Telegram shut down illicit crypto-centric marketplaces Xinbi and Haowang, formerly Huione, in partnership with blockchain sleuths Elliptic. The two marketplaces were thought to have processed transactions worth over $40 billion combined on Telegram since 2021.

Title: Number of road deaths so far this year passes total figure for 2024

The number of deaths on Irish roads so far this year has passed the total figure for 2024, according to provisional data from An Garda Síochána. There have been 180 road deaths to date as of Monday, 16 more compared with the same period last year. The fatalities include 70 drivers, 30 motorcyclists, 42 pedestrians, 20 passengers, 14 cyclists, two e-scooter drivers or passengers and a pillion passenger. There were 174 road deaths in 2024, including 72 drivers, 17 motorcyclists, 35 passengers, 33 pedestrians, 12 cyclists and three e-scooter drivers or passengers. There has been a 76 per cent increase to date in the number of motorcyclist deaths compared to last year. Three people died in two road crashes in Co Tipperary over the weekend, while a woman driver, aged in her 70s, also died over recent days after she was hospitalised following a single-car crash in Co Kerry last Wednesday. Susan Gray, founder of the Parc road safety and victim support group, said the annual increase in road deaths was “very worrying”. “We’re into the most dangerous time of the year, the festive period. People are being reminded but still the figures are going up and a lot of them are young people,” she said. “To think that families are preparing for Christmas and may even have presents under the tree, will now be visiting their loved ones at graves. I can’t get that out of my head. It’s just heartbreaking and there is just so much more that could be done by the Government and the Road Safety Authority [RSA].” [ PR campaigns are not enough to stop people dying on our roads. Here is what we need to doOpens in new window ] Ms Gray’s husband Steve died after being knocked down by an unaccompanied learner driver on St Stephen’s Day 2004 in Inishowen, Co Donegal. The RSA said the rise in road fatalities underscores the “urgent need” for continued vigilance and collective action. The State agency said it remains “unwavering” in its commitment and efforts to prevent crashes, improve road safety and promote behaviours and measures that can save lives on roads. Seán Canney, Minister of State at the Department of Transport with responsibility for road transport, said he was “devastated that the numbers are so high this year”. “It is important we take stock of what we’re doing individually on the roads and what we’re doing in terms of providing safety, enforcement. We will renew all our efforts to make the roads safer,” he told The Irish Times. Mr Canney also said he had confidence in the RSA but that there was “more to do” around “messaging to people”. [ Concerning rise in Irish road deaths and lack of impactful responseOpens in new window ] An Garda Síochána is conducting an enforcement operation on the roads throughout the Christmas period, which began on December 1st and will continue until January 5th, 2026. Last week, 147 people were arrested for driving under the influence of either alcohol or drugs, with more than 3,265 drivers detected for speeding offences. A driver was found to be travelling 101km/h in a 50km/h zone on Newtownpark Avenue in Blackrock, south Co Dublin. Another motorist was discovered driving 118km/h in a 60km/h zone in Stranorlar, Co Donegal, with a separate driver travelling 201km/h in a 120km/h region in Kinvara, Co Galway. More than 600 vehicles were seized by gardaí for a range of offences under the Road Traffic Act 1961. About 330 fixed-charge notices were issued for using a mobile phone while driving and 85 fines handed out for failing to wear a seat belt. An Garda Síochána said the Christmas period was one of the busiest on Irish roads and when road users are at the highest risk of being involved in a fatal or serious crash. “Members of An Garda Síochána are out day and night across the country as part of our enforcement campaign and will intercept drivers who are putting their lives and the lives of others at risk,” it said. The Department of Transport said 2025 has been a “very difficult year” on Irish roads. It said road safety remains a “core priority” for the Government, with Budget 2026 providing €1.72 billion for “national, regional and local roads, alongside safety-focused measures”.

Title: Venezuela is where Trump aims to annihilate our adversaries

Venezuela is swiftly becoming ground zero of President Trump’s America First reshaping of US foreign policy. The United States seized the oil tanker Skipper off the country’s coast Wednesday, capping off months of heightened tensions. The sanctioned vessel has carried crude for Iran and had an estimated 1.1 million barrels on board. On the surface, the pressure’s been over ridding Caracas of illegitimate President Nicolás Maduro. Ditto ending government-sponsored narco-terrorists using Venezuela as a transit hub and safe haven to smuggle Colombian cocaine and other illicit drugs to North America and the Caribbean. But confronting Maduro is far more about Team Trump reasserting US dominance in the Western Hemisphere. Trump’s intended recipients? Beijing, Tehran and Moscow. His message? Hands off. Trump signaled his reassertion of the Monroe Doctrine was coming just days before taking office in January. While the mainstream media obsessed about his comments about Greenland and the Panama Canal, they missed his point. He was warning about China’s short- and long-term intentions to create economic and military strangleholds on the Americas. This includes President Xi Jinping’s designs to dominate the Northern Sea Route by declaring China a “Near-Arctic State” in 2018. Nominally, the declaration was about “developing shipping, carrying out scientific research and exploiting the region’s oil, gas, minerals, fisheries and other resources,” as the Wall Street Journal reported. But it’s really about Beijing boxing the United States out of the Arctic, especially as its sea lanes open up due to polar warming. Hence Trump’s emphasis on the importance of Greenland in defending the NSR and his welcomed October announcement that the Coast Guard is purchasing 11 new icebreakers. Xi is playing the same strategic game in the Panama Canal. Chinese companies control the key Pacific and Atlantic ports of Balboa and Cristóbal. Under the Trump administration’s aegis, a memorandum of understanding was signed in March for US-based BlackRock to acquire the ports. Beijing, however, has delayed the closing, citing national security interests. And at the end of the world in South America, Xi is seeking to acquire port facilities in Punta Arenas, Chile, to dominate the Drake Passage. Team Trump essentially seeks to end any great-power competition in the Americas — particularly China’s efforts to militarily dominate sea passages in the Arctic, Panama Canal Zone and Antarctica. Given the National Security Strategy’s proclamation of the “Trump Corollary” to the Monroe Doctrine, we now know how America intends to check and eventually end Chinese, Russian and Iranian malevolent activities in the Western Hemisphere. It aims to preserve freedom of navigation in the Americas; eject crippling Chinese Belt and Road Initiative investment in Latin America and the Caribbean and replace it with American capital; and marginalize malign actors such as Maduro in Venezuela while rewarding US allies. It’s a heavy lift. Through 2024, cumulative direct Chinese foreign investment in Latin America and the Caribbean stood at $8.53 billion, per Enrique Dussel Peters at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. China’s Development Bank and its Export-Import Bank had lent the regions more than $120 billion as of 2023. Notably, Venezuela tops that list at $59.2 billion. Brazil — a founding member of Beijing-dominated BRICS — is next at $32.4 billion, with Jamaica the largest Caribbean recipient of Chinese bank loans at $1.6 billion. Significantly, Jamaica is a major “hot spot” of trafficking illicit drugs from Venezuela to the United States, Mexico and Canada, per the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. Team Trump views confronting Venezuela as the best means of countering growing Chinese influence in the Americas. Caracas is Beijing’s crown jewel in South America. Eighty percent of Venezuelan oil exports “went directly and indirectly to China through little-known intermediaries,” Reuters reports. That’s code for shadow oil fleets. Such as Skipper, the oil tanker seized falsely flying Guyana’s flag. The United States sanctioned the vessel in 2022 for transporting oil for Iran to support Hezbollah militants in Lebanon and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ Quds Force. Iran is undeterred and doubling down on defying Trump in Venezuela. Petroleos de Venezuela and the National Iranian Oil Refining and Distribution Company signed a deal to improve fuel output at the Paraguaná Refining Center to end Caracas’ “reliance on US refinery technology,” Reuters reports. Russia lurks in Venezuela as well. President Vladimir Putin — hypocritically, given his complaints of NATO aid to Ukraine in his backyard — has supplied the country with military aid, training and investment since the days of Hugo Chávez in the early 2000s. The two countries signed a 10-year Treaty on Strategic Partnership and Cooperation in October. Putin reaffirmed his support for Maduro in a telephone call Thursday. The Kremlin is not ready to capitulate to Trump in Venezuela. Nor is Maduro, who appears to believe he can outlast Trump despite the largest buildup of US forces in the Caribbean since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis and new Trump administration sanctions on him, his family and business cronies. Maduro’s obstinance could cause the standoff with Washington to become kinetic. US military strikes on Venezuelan ports, army bases and airports used in staging and trafficking illicit drugs may be in the making. Trump’s newly enshrined Trump Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine hangs in the balance. It’s unlikely the president will stand down. Maduro is overestimating his position and underestimating Trump’s resolve. María Corina Machado, who escaped Venezuela last week to accept her Nobel Peace Prize, stands at the ready to succeed the corrupt Maduro as president. The question is: When do US demonstrations translate into action? Trump cannot allow Maduro to stand in the way of Washington re-establishing strategic security in the Americas. Venezuela is the necessary first step. Diminishing Beijing, Tehran and Moscow throughout the hemisphere is the worthy goal. Mark Toth writes on national security and foreign policy. Col. (Ret.)

Title: JPMorgan expands blockchain push with tokenized money-market fund on Ethereum

JPMorgan Chase is preparing to deepen its push into blockchain-based finance through a tokenized money-market fund on Ethereum, according to a Wall Street Journal report published on Monday. The bank has not formally announced the product, but the report suggests JPMorgan is moving closer to offering onchain versions of traditional cash-management tools as institutional interest in tokenization grows. The reported initiative comes as large investors look for ways to deploy idle cash more efficiently while maintaining regulatory compliance. With about $4 trillion in assets under management, JPMorgan’s reported plans highlight how tokenization is evolving from experimental pilots into investment products associated with major global balance sheets. The proposed fund would enter a fast-growing segment of digital finance where money-market products are increasingly viewed as a bridge between traditional markets and blockchain infrastructure. The fund, known as My OnChain Net Yield Fund, or MONY, has been seeded with $100 million from JPMorgan’s asset management division, the Wall Street Journal stated. The product is expected to open to external, qualified investors this week, although no official confirmation has been issued by the bank. The minimum investment is set at $1 million, keeping the fund focused on institutional participation rather than retail investors. MONY is designed to operate in line with conventional money-market funds, holding short-term debt instruments and paying interest on a daily basis. Investors would be able to redeem their shares either in cash or through Circle’s USDC stablecoin, reflecting the growing use of regulated stablecoins in institutional settlement and liquidity management. JPMorgan has built the reported fund on Kinexys Digital Assets, its in-house tokenization platform, with Ethereum selected as the underlying blockchain, according to the Wall Street Journal. Tokenized funds record ownership onchain, allowing faster settlement, real-time visibility, and continuous trading beyond standard market hours. These features are attracting attention from asset managers, trading firms, and treasury desks seeking operational efficiency while continuing to rely on low-risk instruments. Tokenized money-market funds are also increasingly used within decentralised finance ecosystems as reserve assets and as collateral for trading and asset management. JPMorgan’s reported plans place it alongside other large financial institutions that have already launched tokenized money-market products. Franklin Templeton introduced its BENJI fund in 2021, becoming one of the earliest traditional asset managers to adopt blockchain-based fund infrastructure. BlackRock followed in 2024 with its BUIDL fund, developed with tokenization specialist Securitize, which has since attracted about $2 billion in assets, according to data from RWA.xyz.

Title: JPMorgan just crossed a dangerous line with Solana that major banks have strictly avoided until now

JPMorgan issued $50 million in commercial paper on Solana with USDC settlement, but most institutional tokenization remains proof-of-concept scale without displacing traditional workflows. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. JPMorgan recently issued $50 million in US commercial paper for Galaxy Digital on Solana, with Coinbase and Franklin Templeton as buyers. The bank created an on-chain USCP token, settling both issuance and redemption cash flows in USDC rather than bank wires. Both issuance and servicing of the deal ran entirely on blockchain rails. As a template, JPMorgan intends to extend to more issuers, investors, and security types in 2026. The announcement follows a pattern. Institutional on-chain issuance headlines recur every few months, such as Siemens' €300 million digital bond, Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon's tokenized money market funds, and BlackRock's BUIDL crossing $2.85 billion for the first time. Each is presented as a breakthrough. The challenge is separating structural progress from proof-of-concept theater. The value is in tracing what actually happened: asset type, settlement finality, counterparties, permissions, and whether the design choices change future issuance behavior or remain confined to one-off pilots. JPMorgan has run tokenized debt experiments before, but on private infrastructure. In April 2024, the bank facilitated a municipal securities offering for the City of Quincy on its permissioned platform. It issued commercial paper for OCBC on its proprietary distributed ledger. The Solana trade is not the first tokenized debt deal, but it is the first time JPMorgan's stack crosses into a public chain with real-world corporate paper, a brand-name issuer, and buyers who also operate in the crypto ecosystem. The shift from permissioned to public infrastructure matters because it changes who can participate and how assets move. Permissioned platforms limit access to pre-approved entities and keep settlement inside a controlled environment. Public chains expose tokenized assets to broader liquidity, composability with other on-chain instruments, and integration into crypto-native collateral and lending protocols. The JPMorgan deal deliberately crosses that line, settling in USDC on Solana rather than in bank deposits on a private ledger. R3's partnership with the Solana Foundation reinforces the trend. R3's Corda platform already supports roughly $10 billion in tokenized assets for clients, including Euroclear, HSBC, and Bank of America. Integrating Solana as a public chain option for tokenized shares and funds signals that institutions are treating public blockchains as production infrastructure, not just sandbox environments. Tokenized Treasury and money market funds reached approximately $7.4 billion by July 2025, up roughly 80% year-to-date, driven by BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, and Janus Henderson's Anemoy products. These tokens increasingly function as collateral in crypto derivatives and lending, not just as yield-bearing cash parking. Data from rwa.xyz shows tokenized Treasuries surpassed $9 billion in 2025, with BlackRock's BUIDL alone reaching $1 billion in total value locked mid-year and growing to approximately $2.85 billion by October. Additionally, Circle's USYC recently surpassed $1 billion in assets, fueled by its partnership with Binance to use tokenized fund shares as collateral for trading. Most of that growth sits in funds and collateral tokens that live inside walled gardens. BUIDL is limited to qualified institutions and is mainly used as collateral on institutional or large crypto venues. Franklin's BENJI fund is registered under the 1940 Act and allows investors to fund with USDC, but the fund's shares remain constrained by mutual-fund rules. Goldman and BNY Mellon's tokenized MMF work allows institutions to subscribe and redeem via tokenized rails, while keeping the official record and most settlement in traditional infrastructure. The JPMorgan/Galaxy commercial paper deal sits at a different intersection: a mainstream corporate borrower issuing on a public chain, settling into a crypto-native dollar instrument, with investors spanning both traditional finance and digital-asset platforms. That combination is rare enough to warrant scrutiny. Reading tokenized issuance announcements requires a repeatable evaluation framework. Five questions reveal whether a deal changes market structure or remains a one-off experiment. First, what is the asset? Is the blockchain token the legal security itself, or just a representation? Siemens' €300 million bond is issued natively as a digital security with no paper certificate. The JPMorgan/Galaxy commercial paper is conventional CP from a legal standpoint, but with its lifecycle events of issuance, servicing, and eventual redemption mirrored on Solana through the USCP token. The distinction determines whether the blockchain record is authoritative or auxiliary. Second, how does the cash leg settle, and where is finality? Most of the experiments in 2024 and 2025 settle either in central bank money on a permissioned ledger or in fiat via traditional rails. The JPMorgan/Solana deal is one of the first in which issuance and redemption settle into a crypto-native dollar instrument (USDC) on a public chain for a mainstream corporate borrower. That creates settlement finality on-chain rather than relying on off-chain payment confirmation. Third, who is allowed to hold and move the asset? The $7.4 billion in tokenized Treasury and MMF products is held by professional or crypto-savvy investors, with limited mainstream distribution. BUIDL is restricted to qualified institutions. Franklin's BENJI fund is a 1940 Act-registered fund, but mutual fund rules still constrain it. The permission structure determines whether the token can flow freely or remains gated by investor accreditation, KYC, or platform restrictions. Fourth, can the token be reused as collateral, and does DLT solve a real pain point? JPMorgan's Tokenized Collateral Network has demonstrated the use of tokenized money market fund shares as on-chain collateral, with benefits including near-instant repo settlement, atomic delivery-versus-payment, and improved collateral mobilization across fragmented silos. IOSCO's 2025 tokenization report notes that only a small number of tokenized MMFs have been used as collateral for crypto transactions to date, specifically citing BUIDL as one example. The question is whether the token unlocks new collateral velocity or replicates existing workflows on a different infrastructure. Fifth, does the deal connect to enabling policy changes, or does it rely on regulatory forbearance? In late 2025, the OCC issued Interpretive Letter 1188, confirming that national banks may engage in “riskless principal” crypto transactions as part of their banking business. Interpretive Letter 1186 clarified that banks can hold native tokens such as ETH or SOL on their balance sheets to pay network fees and test blockchain platforms. In January 2025, the SEC rescinded Staff Accounting Bulletin 121, which had forced banks to treat custodied crypto as a balance-sheet liability. That regulatory combination makes it plausible that a major bank uses public chains and tokenized MMFs or Treasuries as collateral and settlement assets in production, rather than confining experiments to permissioned environments. The JPMorgan/Galaxy commercial paper scores as follows: the asset is conventional CP with on-chain lifecycle mirroring, not a native digital security. Settlement finality in USDC on Solana removes reliance on bank wires but introduces a dependency on the stablecoin issuer. Counterparties include Galaxy Digital as issuer and Coinbase and Franklin Templeton as buyers, all entities with both traditional finance and crypto infrastructure. The token's permission structure is unclear from public reporting. Whether it is freely transferable on Solana or restricted to authorized holders determines whether it can flow into broader DeFi protocols or remains a closed loop. The deal's collateral reuse potential depends on whether the USCP token can be posted as margin or used in on-chain lending. JPMorgan's existing Tokenized Collateral Network suggests the bank is building toward that capability, but the Solana CP issuance does not yet demonstrate it. The policy backdrop is supportive: OCC guidance now permits banks to intermediate crypto transactions and hold gas tokens, and the SEC's SAB 121 rescission removes a custody accounting barrier. That makes the Solana deal less of a regulatory stretch than it would have been in 2024. The recurring headlines about institutional tokenization create a pattern-recognition problem. Each announcement is framed as transformative, but most remain confined to proof-of-concept scale, permissioned platforms, or asset classes that already have deep traditional infrastructure. The JPMorgan/Solana deal crosses into public chain territory with a recognizable corporate issuer and USDC settlement, but the commercial paper market is already highly liquid and efficient. The question is not whether tokenization is technically feasible, but whether it changes issuance behavior. The 2026 test is whether tokenized debt and cash instruments start displacing traditional workflows at scale. That requires four conditions: regulatory clarity on custody and settlement finality, interoperability standards that allow tokens to move across platforms without fragmentation. Additionally, it needs sufficient liquidity in on-chain venues to compete with traditional order books, and a demonstrated collateral-velocity advantage that justifies the operational overhead of running dual infrastructure. The OCC and SEC moves in 2025 address the first condition. R3's Solana integration and JPMorgan's public-chain expansion suggest progress on the second. The third and fourth remain open questions. Tokenized Treasuries at nearly $9 billion represent a rounding error in the $28 trillion Treasury market. BUIDL's $1.8 billion is meaningful in crypto terms but negligible in global money markets. The tokenized instruments need to prove they are not just another wrapper product, but a genuinely superior collateral and settlement stack. JPMorgan's explicit intention to extend the Solana template to more issuers, investors, and security types in 2026 suggests the bank views the deal as infrastructure building, not PR. Whether that proves accurate depends on adoption beyond the initial cohort of crypto-native investors and whether the tokens can be reused as collateral in production lending and derivatives markets. The framework outlined above provides a way to evaluate each subsequent announcement against those criteria, separating structural progress from one-off experiments that generate headlines but do not change market behavior.

JPMorgan Chase, a global bank with $4 trillion of assets under management, is rolling out a tokenized money-market fund on Ethereum, pushing deeper into blockchain-based finance amid growing demand from institutional clients. The move marks JPMorgan’s first tokenized money market fund, making it the largest GSIB, or Global Systemically Important Banks, to launch such a vehicle on a public blockchain, according to a press release shared with CoinDesk. The fund, dubbed My OnChain Net Yield Fund (MONY), is seeded with $100 million from the bank’s asset management division and is set to open to external, qualified investors this week, the Wall Street Journal reported first. The global bank joins a wave of high-profile financial giants launching tokenized funds on blockchain, with money-market funds leading the charge. Franklin Templeton was among the first traditional finance firms with its BENJI fund in 2021. Then, BlackRock started its BUIDL fund in 2024 with tokenization specialist Securitize, attracting $2 billion in assets to date, per RWA.xyz data. These vehicles allow investors to park idle cash on blockchains to earn a yield — like with a money market fund but with faster settlement times, around-the-clock trading and real-time visibility into ownership. Increasingly, they are also used as a reserve asset for decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and as collateral in trading and asset management. The asset class has grown to $9 billion from $3 billion in a year, RWA.xyz data shows. The broader tokenized asset market is projected to grew to $18.9 trillion by 2033, BCG and Ripple said in a report. "There is a massive amount of interest from clients around tokenization, John Donohue, head of global liquidity at JPMorgan Asset Management, told WSJ. JPMorgan built MONY on Kinexys Digital Assets, the bank's in-house tokenization platform. The product will likely serve as a test case for expanding the bank’s lineup of onchain offerings. "Tokenization can fundamentally change the speed and efficiency of transactions, adding new capabilities to traditional products," Donohue said in a statWe believe that financial products will increasingly transact this way, and we’re excited about the opportunities this creates for our clients and for the whole industry.” Donohue said. Like traditional money-market funds, MONY is set to hold short-term debt instruments and pays interest daily. Investors can redeem shares using either cash or Circle's USDC stablecoin.

Things like mortality rising higher than births in some parts of the country, antibiotic resistance creeping up, disability claims rising, sickness absence climbing… — tern (@1goodtern) December 9, 2025 This recent post on the Twitter/X, which if true, might lead one to believe that such pandemic panic contributes to the geoeconomic panic infecting the world today. Seeing as there has been an acceleration in the geopolitical and geoeconomic breakdown in recent years, largely emanating from the world’s heart of neoliberal capitalism in the US, as well as its (also neoliberal capitalist) vassals and proxies, how much of a role did/does the pandemic play? While that might be impossible to quantify, if we subscribe to the theory that bellicosity derives, at least in part, from crises of capitalism, then if COVID-19 is causing or is contributing to crises of capitalism, then there is likely to be a connection. Evidence of COVID-19 Contribution to Crises of Capitalism Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic the US-led “West” was already in the midst of a capitalism crisis. Source: Michael Roberts’ Blog. COVID has only served to deepen it. A November brief from npj Primary Care Respiratory Medicine highlights the following: …microeconomic impacts, which are estimated at an average annual burden of $1 trillion globally and $9000 per patient in the USA, with some individuals covering substantial out-of-pocket expenses. Annual lost earnings in the USA alone are estimated at approximately $170 billion. Long COVID was associated with increased unemployment, financial distress, and work impairment for up to three years post-infection. Multiple other studies in the past year show how the pandemic has hammered productivity. See here, here, here. Additionally, the pandemic might have deepened what is described as a birth rate crisis in advanced economies. While declining birth rates can have ecological benefits, they cause alarm among the capitalist class due to negative effects on economic growth. While many of these economic trends were already present before the pandemic, COVID-19 accelerated them—or at least accelerated the fear of them. Similarly, while many of the billionaires now driving the US policies in response to these crises were already psychopaths, COVID further broke their brains—if not the virus itself then fear of what it meant for their power. Evidence that Increased Belligerence Is Result of Crises of Capitalism, Which Are Worsened by COVID-19 If one subscribes to the view that capitalist expansion (i.e., the neverending need for growth) will eventually lead to attempts at empire building in order to facilitate such expansion, then the argument is that the US-led “West” needs to do something to kickstart another growth and profitability wave. From economist Michael Roberts: This ‘golden era’ came to an end in the 1970s, when the profitability of capital fell sharply (according to Marx’s law) and the major economies suffered the first simultaneous slump in 1974-75, followed in 1980-2 with a deep manufacturing slump. Keynesian economics was exposed as a failure and economics returned to the neoclassical idea of free markets, free flow of trade and capital, deregulation of state interference and ownership of industry and finance, and the crushing of labour organisations. Profitability was (modestly) restored in the major economies and globalisation became the mantra; in effect the expansion of imperialist exploitation of the periphery under the guise of international trade and capital flows. But again, Marx’s law of profitability exerted its gravitational pull and from the turn of the millennium, the major economies experienced a fall in the profitability of their productive sectors. Only a credit-fuelled boom in finance, real estate and other unproductive sectors disguised that underlying crisis of profitability for a while (the blue line below shows the profitability of US productive sectors and the red line, the overall profitability). Source: BEA NIPA tables, author calculation But eventually this culminated in the global financial collapse, the Euro debt crisis and the Long Depression; further enhanced by the impact of the pandemic slump of 2020. European capital has been left in tatters. And US hegemony now faced a new economic rival, China, after its stupendous rise in manufacturing, trade, and more recently technology, unaffected by economic crises in the West. This is arguably what we are seeing playing out in conflicts across the globe today as the US uses its empire in an attempt to open up new markets. Why is the US trying regime change in Venezuela? Trump said back in 2023 that it’s about the oil. And here’s the current Director of National Intelligence back in 2019: Oil lobbyists have “unprecedented access” to Trump’s administration—meanwhile Pence/Bolton continue their crusade for regime change in Venezuela, the world’s richest oil reserves. The height of swamp politics. #PeopleBeforeProfits #ServiceBeforeSelf https://t.co/jlbip5u8tV — Tulsi Gabbard 🌺 (@TulsiGabbard) April 4, 2019 And it’s not just oil. Nobel Peace Prize winner María Corina Machado who argues for the bombing of her home country recently told the Miami Business Forum the following: “For the U.S., we will turn this criminal hub into a security shield in the heart of the Americas. We will open Venezuela for foreign investment, I am talking about a 1.7 trillion dollar opportunity, not only in oil and gas, … but also in mining, in gold, in infrastructure, power. We will open markets, we will have security for foreign investment, and a massive privatization program that is waiting for you”. Why does the US and its European vassals want to dismantle the Russian Federation? A major driver has always been to relive the heyday 1990s when the US’ best and brightest sucked hundreds of billions of dollars out of the country with devastating results (the number of Russians living in poverty jumped from two million to sixty million in just a few years and life expectancy plummeted among other catastrophes). There are, of course, other reasons, but those too have to do with crises of capitalism wrapped up in the pandemic. At the time Project Ukraine became a war, the EU had been in a prolonged (largely self-inflicted) economic crisis for years. The bloc’s emergency 750 billion euro COVID recovery program was supposed to stitch the union back up again, but it has underwhelmed, and instead much of the bloc elite have turned to war in a desperate bid for economic growth and to keep the union train on the tracks. That is summarized here by Wolfgang Streeck: A possible solution for the coming fiscal crisis of an EU warfare state might be member states allowing the Union to issue its own debt—which would, however, also require changes in the Treaties. It is fair to assume that von der Leyen’s out-of-thin-air fiscal commitments in the context of the Ukrainian war were, and are, aimed exactly at getting member states to grant the EU this right to incur debt, constitutive for a modern state. Indeed, that right has long been demanded by advocates of European supranational centralization and integration. An EU borrowing capacity would give member states access, outside of national state budgets and therefore invisible to national voters, to the favorite medicine of underfunded capitalist states, public debt. Keeping national contributions to the European Union low by allowing the Union to debt-finance part of its expenses would amount to another, more advanced, form of political level-shifting. Fascist Solutions in Silicon Valley Back in the US, during the early days of COVID the seeds were planted for the new imperial strategy we’re seeing today. Marc Andreessen, the billionaire who co-founded the venture capital firm a16z and, before that, played a role in the invention of the modern web browser, was a driving force behind the elite Signal group chats that began to look for solutions to their problems back in 2020. According to Semafor, those chats included other billionaires and members of companies that now play dominant roles in America’s efforts to remake the country and the world into technomonarchies. The chats were filled with billionaire grievances—that they were being underappreciated and shackled—and conviction that they knew the best way forward for humanity. As Semafor notes, “The Group Chat Era depended on part of the American elite feeling shut out from public spaces, and on the formation of a new [Silicon Valley] conservative consensus.”1 They were reportedly most concerned with “power.” That makes sense if you subscribe to the teachings of monarchist pundit Curtis Yarvin who was reportedly lionized in the Andreessen-led Signal chats. Here’s Quinn Slobodian on Yarvin’s vision for the future: Right-wing accelerationists imagine existing sovereignty shattering into what Yarvin, writing under the pen name Mencius Moldbug, calls a “patchwork” of private entities, ideally governed by what one might call technomonarchies. Existing autocratic polities like Dubai serve as rough prototypes for how nations could be dismantled into “a global spiderweb of tens, even hundreds, of thousands of sovereign and independent mini-countries, each governed by its own joint-stock corporation without regard to the residents’ opinions.” These would be decentralized archipelagoes: fortified nodes in a circuitry still linked by finance, trade, and communication. Think of the year 1000 in Middle Europe but with vertical take-off and landing taxis and Starlink internet. Yarvin expressed the essence of the worldview recently when he enthused over Trump’s proposal to ethnically cleanse the Gaza Strip and rebuild it as a US-backed colony securitized as an asset and sold to investors—as he called it, “the first charter city backed by US legitimacy: Gaza, Inc. Stock symbol: GAZA.” We are now seeing ongoing attempts to create this vision—whether in Gaza, guarding the billionaire pet project in Honduras, “Freedom Cities” in the US, the embrace of the UAE in yet another genocide, or in the deepening of an American political economic system which guarantees profits for the monopolistic weapons and tech surveillance sectors through endless war at home and abroad. Again much of these symptoms were already present in the US, but why did the pandemic produce this concerted effort from the Silicon Valley and other billionaires to double down? They were, after all, already billionaires who already control much of what passes as social planning in the US. These chats took place even before their arch nemesis Lina Khan began modest efforts at the Federal Trade Commission to rein in Silicon Valley and other billionaire rapaciousness. What were they so fearful of? What was evident to us all back when the powers that be still cared about the pandemic was presumably also evident to them. They saw the US struggling with shortages, unable to even produce personal protective equipment, and it scared them. It drove home the point that the US global position was weakening. Now, the lords of Silicon Valley and finance might be chiefly responsible for that development, but in their telling it’s because they haven’t been given enough power. One only needs to take a look at Andreessen’s April 2020 screed titled “It’s Time to Build”, which became something of a rallying cry for the technomonarchists, for a glimpse into this mindset. Whether they really believe it or it’s just opportunistic power-grabbing matters little; what does is that so far they have been successful, which is bad news for everyone, including them. The second obvious factor would likely be the growth crisis mentioned above and how COVID had the potential to make it worse. They were also horrified by what they saw as power shifting to the peasants via more generous, albeit temporary, safety net benefits and work-from-home policies. Tim Gurner might be Australian, but I believe he provided one of the more candid omissions of the billionaires’ views in this clip: Gurner Group founder Tim Gurner tells the Financial Review Property Summit workers have become “arrogant” since COVID and “We’ve got to kill that attitude.” https://t.co/lcX3CCxGuj pic.twitter.com/f9HK2YZRRE — Financial Review (@FinancialReview) September 12, 2023 Of course, these billionaire fears played the major role in the “return to normalcy” (for the peasants) push. But Andreessen and friends didn’t stop pushing there. They are part of a larger plan. Edward Ongweso Jr. looks past all the bubble talk at how AI is integral to the US plan of securing hegemonic primacy in the 21st century—regardless of whether the bubble bursts or not. The whole piece is well worth a read, but here a few key pieces: …“the final act of a three-act play” of US imperial management, featuring an evolution from “dollar diplomacy” to “oil diplomacy” to “compute diplomacy” centered around deploying our state apparatus and capital to preserve global hegemony… …the United States could manufacture a “sovereignty crisis” with some hysteria about compromised datacenters and Chinese chips—the only cure, then, is the American option: US-made chips (Nvidia), US-controlled cloud architecture (Microsoft/Amazon), US-controlled financing (BlackRock, Emirati investment firm MGX), and so on. …What political vehicle will meet the task for building this new order? One candidate is the burgeoning coalition that we can describe as the Compute Axis: 1) Silicon Valley and its capital-intensive dream of building God out of sand; 2) Trump and his brigands—concerned with transactional relationships, deregulation, and imperial plunder; 3) the sovereign capital of Gulf sovereigns. There’s certainly no guarantee it’ll work, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t going to try. In the meantime, what does it mean for the peasants? The tech bro takeover must continue “because China…” Picture CCP-controlled Chinese AI running the world. How does that make you feel? https://t.co/yxQZ9es5MB — Marc Andreessen 🇺🇸 (@pmarca) February 6, 2025 To “win”, America just must turn over all — as opposed to the large majority— of its capital allocation decisions to a bunch of billionaires chiefly concerned with cementing their grip on power. That’s always the common theme. In order to “build” to “win” there must be no regulations, and AI must be supported to the moon. These policies are already teed up for Democrats 2028 in the form of “abundance,” which when you really boil it down is just the flip side to same coin that is Trump’s current all-in AI approach: the technomonarchists must be given everything they need and want and they will deliver us to their idea of victory. Despite the current tech-friendly reign, Silicon Valley titans are still having a rough go of it. And the great irony is that they’re accelerating America’s demise: Isn’t one of the most obvious features of China’s success that it’s built on capacity to discipline its capitalist firms – including the “inevitable chiselers in their ranks.” Brings to mind this observation from FDR, seemingly lost to Western posterity. https://t.co/IAzOdHlbtK https://t.co/8QCfeZHE3q pic.twitter.com/U8GJ4SoOpA — Nikhil Pal Singh (@nikhil_palsingh) November 30, 2025 What the recent events from Venezuela to Gaza to the streets of the US demonstrate, however, is that unless decision-making power is taken away from the techmonarchists, the world is in for a whole lot more hurt—both at home and abroad. We likely would have gotten to this breakdown point regardless, but the COVID-19 pandemic, rather than serving as moment for reflection, cooperation, and as Andreessen put it, an opportunity to “build,” tragically became a moment of acceleration with US and Western elites doubling down on nearly all dystopian fronts. As they face more setbacks, why would the next response be any different? *** Notes Let me post a little criticism: when you say that when Covid started the west was in the midst of a productivity crisis, and then illustrate it with a profitability graph. I have lot of issues with measures of productivity in terms of money value but in any case two different concepts are productivity and profitability. This does not mean any criticism on the thesis of the article. For that I would need further thinking but something has been clear to me these years: The Ukraine war might have started sooner if there had not been an interfering pandemic. The pandemic delayed it for a while. Looks like I mixed up text and graphs there. Thanks for pointing out. Fixed. I am going to take a theme of predation today, after Michaelmas’s response to a comment that I made in comments yesterday. Predation is, in a sense rational, even if immoral. What we are witnessing is another stage of predation by humans. The expropriation of wealth isn’t something new, and what is going on now is the expropriation of wealth from the working class, poor, and, incidentally, the middle classes. Gurner isn’t a rarity — he’s vulgar capitalism in all its glory. The technological change going from software to web browsers to platforms to AI is causing a redistribution in power. People like to talk about Gutenberg, movable type, the Reformation, and power. Hannah Arendt was as skeptic of the Reformation because she considered it as an excuse to confiscate wealth: From The Human Condition, published in 1958: “For the enormous and still proceeding accumulation of wealth in modern society, which was started by expropriation— the expropriation of the peasant classes which in turn was the almost accidental consequence of the expropriation of Church and monastic property after the Reformation—has never shown much consideration for private property but has sacrificed it whenever it came into conflict with the accumulation of wealth. Proudhon’s dictum that property is theft has a solid basis of truth in the origins of modern capitalism; … ” Meanwhile, the response from much of middle-brow Anglo-America is beggar thy neighbor and cheering on the predation, much as mobs sacked the churches in the Low Countries during the Reformation. So the essay by Conor Gallagher is an excellent diagnosis. If we go by the Reformation, we are in for thirty, forty, fifty years of ideological / religious wars. The populations of parts of Europe like Alsace were reduced to mere thousands. Because the predators want to wreck the state, the state is the way out. Ironically. Yet war is the health of the state, so people like Trump, Hillary Clinton, Ursula von der Leyen are symptoms of degradation. And besides their love of war, they hate the working class and know nothing of industrial production or the traditional arts and crafts. PS: I do have a quibble, so I will quibble. I disagree with a word here: “Similarly, while many of the billionaires now driving the US policies in response to these crises were already psychopaths, COVID further broke their brains—if not the virus itself then fear of what it meant for their power.” Nope. They are not psychopaths. They are predators. They are more or less rational, even if driven by their fears. Think about MacBeth. He isn’t crazy. He and the Lady decide to murder for predation and profit. So if we simply get rid of all these immoral people problem solved? I don’t think so. And I believe the point of Macbeth is that predation makes him crazy. Power corrupts but the corruption in turn is self limiting. So here’s suggesting that all the tech futurism is merely vaporware by people in denial about their own humanity and a desire to create a kind of religion out of technology. It’s not new at all but simply the same old thing. Tuchman called it the March of Folly. So here’s suggesting that all the tech futurism is merely vaporware by people in denial about their own humanity and a desire to create a kind of religion out of technology. Add to this the expectation of immortality or at least living to 150 because of said tech futurism Or having your brain implanted in a robot ala dick cheney. To dig a little deeper into Macbeth, it’s not his desire for the wealth and power of the King that ‘makes him crazy’, but the conflict between that – largely forced on him by his wife – and his inherent sense of right and morality “Too full of the milk of human kindness,” as she says of him. Don’t forget it’s Lady Macbeth that has to finish the job and then suffers her own crisis of conscience – “Out, damn spot” – before being driven to suicide. It’s ‘the milk of human kindness’ that’s missing today. MACBETH Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck, Till thou applaud the deed. Come, seeling night, Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day, And with thy bloody and invisible hand Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond Which keeps me pale. Light thickens And the crow makes wing to the rooky wood; Good things of day begin to droop and drowse, While night’s black agents to their preys do rouse. Thou marvell’st at my words; but hold thee still. Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill. So, prithee, go with me. I shall quibble back, and posit the possibility that you have to be a psychopath in order to be okay with predating upon your own species. These techno-bros behave like the love children of characters from Atlas Shrugged and The Great Gatsby, surrogated inside sundry succubi. I fervently wish that they would just take their Ill-gotten gains and just GO. To Mars, Elysium, their island bunkers, wherever …. Ugh. I guess I’m just cranky this morning… Erm, in France was the French Revolution that confiscated church property to support the new government. Then bishop Talleyrand read out the decree and was pretty shortly excommunicated. It was returned to the church in the Restoration. So this can hardly be seen at least there as expropriation from the peasants, since the Revolution also resulted in destruction of land records and land reform. Some of the Church’s lands were returned during the Restoration. But any lands sold or auctioned off between 1789 and 1815 were lost. The buyers–mainly well-to-do peasants and bourgeois–got to keep them. Napoleon insisted that the Church agree to this as part of his Concordat (1801). Up until then the market value of those properties had been depressed because of chronic uncertainty (thanks to the political situation) over whether the Church might or might not get them back. Needless to say, this provision of the Concordat boosted the property values and made Napoleon extremely popular with the proprietaires. “mobs sacked the churches in the Low Countries during the Reformation” I don’t know about the Low Countries, but I have run across the history of iconoclasm in Wittenberg, the “birthplace” of the Reformation. Luther was on the lam, hiding out at Elector Frederick’s place, because the pope had put him under the ban. Back in Wittenberg, the leadership of the Reformation was taken up by Andreas Bodenstein von Karlstadt, Luther’s colleague at the University of Wittenberg. Karstadt, as he’s commonly called in Lutheran writings, was an enthusiastic iconoclast who took very seriously the prohibition against images in the Ten Commandments as they appear in Exodus 20. Karlstadt and his followers went about breaking windows and destroying statues with such abandon that Luther came out of hiding to put a stop to the madness. Luther’s views won out among Lutherans, and Karlstadt was forced into what became the Radical Reformation where he had plenty of company as an iconoclast. Church decoration, Luther taught, was a matter of adiophora, Greek for “indifferent things.” Accordingly, one can find Lutheran churches with empty crosses and no statues or Lutheran churches like the one my spouse grew up in with a cross with corpus behind the altar and even a statue of Mary behind the baptismal font. The reason for Karlstadt’s destruction was not the same as the fervor of Spanish anarchists’ for looting the Spanish Roman Catholic churches that had hoarded wealth for centuries even when surrounded by hungry people. The anti-clericalism of the Anarchist Revolution (or one might say anticipatory counter-revolution) in Barcelona in 1936 is brought out by the movie Libertarias. where a monseigneur is is taken out and shot summarily. As the tough female anarchist explains to a shocked new recruit, “It’s a revolution, not a fiesta.” This is all fine as a general statement of COVID-19’s exposure of what neoliberal financialization and deindustrialization have done to the ‘West’ and a piece of agitprop about Silicon Valley oligarchs’ aims. But I think Naked Capitalism had a more useful analysis by political scientist Tom Ferguson and a colleague last month — Tom Ferguson and Nick French: Red Tech’s Political Power, Its War on Labor and the Environment https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2025/11/tom-ferguson-and-nick-french-red-techs-political-power-its-war-on-labor-and-the-environment.html More useful because more specific. Ferguson and his colleague detail — based on their research and interviews — exactly why ‘Big Tech’ on one side and its political enemies on the other side currently have the positions they do, what specific parties hope to gain, what they’re doing, and then isn’t afraid to draw some conclusions. Starting with, as Yves said, that ‘Silicon Valley’s .. opposition to unions…(is) not out of the traditional desire to crush wage rates but to roll (over) all opposition to their campaign to remake society.’ And Ferguson gets specific from there. ‘A possible solution for the coming fiscal crisis of an EU warfare state might be member states allowing the Union to issue its own debt—which would, however, also require changes in the Treaties.’ That is half the story. If you are going to raise what will be hundreds of billions of dollars of debt, then you are going to need collateral. And the guys at The Duran say that this will be in the form of the EU being able to levy taxes. Maybe 1% at first – like a VAT or a GST – but then could eventually will go to five, ten or twenty percent. It could even be said that the real reason for raising all those debts is to enable EU taxation. No doubt Ursula will bring it in under an emergency decree or something dispensing with a vote of the EU member States. How will the tax be enforced? Will Ursula also create an EU police force for this? I would imagine they would set up an EU taxation office and taxes would be collected at point of sale along with any taxes that individual EU States would collect. These would be electronically be sent on to Brussels. So maybe she would also create an equivalent of the IRS as well. No-one wants to take on the IRS after all- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G56VgsLfKY4 (22 secs) Why do you think she’s so intent on building a EU “army”. She’s alot of things but dumb enough to think any military force that Europe could manage to kludge together in the next few years would stand any chance against Russia is unlikely. So why does she want it? Simple to unleash on member states if they get out of hand, if the population gets a little to riled up, starts general striking, or maybe voting the wrong way, maybe they want to leave the EU. Yes the support of an unwinnable war, militarization,raising EU debt etc, its all about the last attempt to bring about the Federal Europe dream. Given the supine ‘leaders’ of the major nations it might work, although the odds are probably on an acrimonious split of many leaving the old ‘coal and steel’ members standing. If the Euro is to persist as an international currency, this is inevitable. It should have been part of the original project, if they had been honest (beyond their capacity). If there is no democratic ascent to the taxation, it will be the last thing the Commission ever does before it is replaced by either sovereign seizure by the Council, or the EU falling apart. I’ve been wondering lately about general mal-investment gumming up the economy. In classical terms, businesses need X technology to raise productivity and pay their debts, but the big investors invest everything into Y technology instead, which turns out to be a dead end. Productivity stagnates, businesses turn into debt-ridden zombies, and the big investors start looking for another dumb idea hail-mary to recoup their losses. Work-from-home and Zoom didn’t make offices more productive, Door Dash didn’t make restaurants more profitable, streaming didn’t save Hollywood, and nothing happens on Meta. If all that money had been thrown into infrastructure, logistics, energy, agriculture, or whatever, or even just giving the old guard at the job more time to train the new hires, things would surely be better. “”As America, we now have two choices: win in AI, including win in open source AI. Or let China win in AI, all over the world. I believe it is critically important that we win. Kneecapping American AI, and American open source AI, to protect Big Proprietary AI is asking to lose.”” Frankly I would rather China won than these guys. Thanks for resurrecting the excellent passage from FDR, Connor. If anything, I think FDR was being excessively gracious by allowing good motives on the part of the wealthy elites who are trying to control society. Of course, people will always self-describe their actions as being well intentioned, but one should not take their word on this. Wealthy elites always feel a great sense of entitlement, coming from a belief that (a) great wealth is a marker for great intelligence and ability, and (b) intelligence and ability entitle one to make decisions for an entire society. Particularly in the current era (I can’t speak for earlier eras) it’s been striking how ordinary and lacking in ability members of the wealthy elite class have been. Even in the rare case where an elite excels in a narrow technical skill, they invariably lack the generalized ability to see farther than others in a broad sense and to draw the proper conclusions from what they see, which is the hallmark of intelligence. Our descent into rule-by-the-wealthy in the last few decades explains a lot of what’s been going on, I think. It’s the opposite of a meritocracy. One nit-pick with the sources cited by Conor: the expression “Long Depression” is a well-established historical term designating the profound economic crisis that raked (mainly) Europe and North America from 1873 to 1896. The “Great Depression” is of course what happened in the period 1929-1939. I have seen the term “Long Recession” used to describe the economic crisis following the great financial crash of 2008. The economic crisis of the 1970s had nothing to do with the failure of Keynesian economics – it was really all about the oil shocks. But the Keynesian thing certainly paved the toward 40+ years of accelerating neoliberalism and inequality. Your email address will not be published.

SambaNova has also engaged with other potential investors, having signed preliminary agreements with them. This acquisition could significantly enhance Intel’s AI capabilities by incorporating SambaNova’s specialised chip designs into its portfolio. In 2021, SambaNova was valued at $5bn in a funding round led by SoftBank Group’s Vision Fund 2. Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. The potential acquisition aligns with Intel’s strategy to strengthen its position in the AI sector, where customised chip solutions are increasingly important. Founded in 2017 by Stanford University professors, SambaNova concentrates on developing advanced AI chips that compete with Nvidia’s offerings. Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, who serves as chairman of SambaNova, has been integral since its inception through his venture capital firm Walden International. Walden led a $56m Series A funding round for SambaNova in 2018. Based in Palo Alto, California, the company has attracted investment from prominent entities including SoftBank Vision Fund 2 and BlackRock. In November 2025, SambaNova partnered with OVHcloud to enhance ultra-low latency inference solutions aimed at rapid processing across sectors such as financial trading and cybersecurity. This collaboration seeks to address the growing demand for faster data processing capabilities that are crucial in high-stakes environments where every millisecond counts. The partnership aims to unlock a wide range of use cases, potentially improving operational efficiency and reducing latency-induced errors in critical applications. By leveraging SambaNova’s technology, OVHcloud expects to deliver more responsive and reliable AI-driven solutions to its clients across various industries. Additionally, SambaNova secured an agreement in October 2025 with Infercom to deploy its SambaManaged platform for Europe’s first sovereign Inference-as-a-Service offering.

* Banks are 'cost winners' of AI boom, BlackRock says * European banks remain undervalued, despite strong rally * AI could add $340 billion annually to global banking, McKinsey By Joice Alves LONDON, Dec 15 (Reuters) - After a stellar 2025, investors expect shares in European banks to keep heading higher in 2026, supported by strong earnings and, crucially, cost savings stemming from artificial intelligence. As fears of a recession and interest rate cuts from the European Central Bank have subsided, investors have turned even more positive towards European banks, revising up their expectations for the sector, despite a complicated backdrop. Meanwhile, AI has emerged as a new force drawing investors to European lenders' shares, partly because a dearth of technology companies in the region has forced many to hunt for AI beneficiaries in old-economy markets. Banks have started to use AI to improve operational efficiency and fraud detection, as well as to reduce staff costs. "European banks could be a real beneficiary of AI," said Helen Jewell, chief investment officer for fundamental equities at BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, with about $12 trillion under management. "A lot of the AI story has been focused on the revenue winners, but we also know that when it comes to AI, there is a beneficiary from the cost winners," she said at a press event. UBS said in a note to investors they see AI as a key source of potential upside to banks' near-term valuations and longer- term earnings. But that comes with risks. Warnings over AI-related exuberance and the risks of a dot-com style bust have come from various sides, including the International Monetary Fund and the Bank of England. And risks aren't only AI-related. The ECB said euro zone banks face 'unprecedentedly high' risk of shocks including geopolitical tensions, shifting trade policies, climate-related crises and even a dollar squeeze for banks exposed to the volatile U.S. currency. Yet investors have snapped up bank stocks in earnest. Societe Generale shares have rallied 140% this year, Commerzbank 125% and those in Barclays rose almost 70%. An index of European bank stocks is up more than 60%, on top of the 25% gain in 2024 and more than four times better than the pan European index. Investors also view them as relatively cheap, particularly when compared with U.S. banking shares. European bank stocks currently trade around 1.17 times their price-to-book value, some 40% below their 2007 peak and below the 1.7 times of their U.S. rivals, according to LSEG data. EARNINGS EXPECTATIONS JUMP In terms of costs, Goldman Sachs said in a note that costs would grow at a compound annual rate of only 1% between 2025 and 2027. The U.S. bank also sees efficiency continuing well into 2026, with banks' cost/income ratios improving by 130 basis points year on year, meaning companies are expected to spend less to generate income. Consulting firm McKinsey estimated last year that AI could bring the global banking industry as much as $340 billion a year in additional value, with a drop in operational costs of 20%. Even if AI implementation savings take years to fully emerge, it will be a big enough shift to drive greater expansion in valuations, UBS said. Last month, analysts raised their net revisions for the sector by the most since May 2023, and 12-month forward earnings growth expectations jumped to the highest since 2023, according to IBES data. Growth in bank lending to euro zone firms is still running near its highest since mid-2023, according to the most recent ECB data. Credit growth to businesses was unchanged at 2.9% in October - just below August's 3%, the most since May 2023 - compared to the previous month, while loan growth to households accelerated to a 2-1/2-year high of 2.8% from 2.6%. BlackRock's Jewell expects European banks to return 20-25% of market value to shareholders over the next three years via dividends and share buybacks. "If you put together valuation and ... the shareholder remuneration, you still have an asset class that is quite attractive," Equita co-head of research Domenico Ghilotti said, adding that merger activity is another driver underpinning the sector. The takeover of Mediobanca by state-backed Monte dei Paschi di Siena was one of the biggest in the sector this year, transforming Italian banking. Other deals could be on the way. "What we are seeing is economic resilience within Europe, and that means that even if we do see more rate cuts, that economic resilience... will be good for European banks," BlackRock's Jewell said.

Title: This New Bitcoin Futures ETF Could Be Pulling All-Nighters

A new proposed ETF would hold bitcoin only after markets close. Lilly Riddle lilly@thedailyupside.com Wall Street has a new nighttime routine, and it’s not about remembering to wear a retainer. A new ETF would hold bitcoin products only during overnight hours after the markets close, shifting into short-term US Treasuries during the day, according to a filing last week with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The goal is to capitalize on bitcoin’s performance during the night and slumps during the day. The strategy, called the Nicholas Bitcoin and Treasuries AfterDark ETF (NGHT), is the latest intersection of digital assets and traditional finance. But some experts warned that the fund may let traders take advantage of the predictable and forced buys and sells. “[W]e took a 24/7 permissionless asset and somehow invented a night-shift ETF for it,” a crypto influencer wrote on X using the handle Blackthorne. “The real alpha is not owning time slices of bitcoin, it’s front‑running the tourists who think they can.” The idea behind the strategy is that investors would have higher returns by only trading bitcoin assets at night. For example, if an investor held the iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) only during after-hours trading, performance would be up 222% since January of last year, according to data from Bespoke Investment Group. In the same filing, Nicholas Financial also proposed a fund that would factor in time of day to its trading strategy, called the Nicholas Bitcoin Tail ETF (BHDG). The company’s other funds, however, have had mixed results this year: Crypto All Day, Every Day. Crypto strategies — from memecoin funds to crypto indexes — are flourishing under a new, laxer regulatory environment, with the SEC recently signaling its support for new spot crypto products. “I think the industry is maturing,” head of sector and industry research at VettaFi Roxanna Islam told ETF Upside. “Advisors and investors are seeing the value of diversification within the crypto space, not just using it to make single asset bets. So issuers are starting to look to diversify more among their crypto holdings.” With the average cost of health care regularly outpacing inflation, Americans are struggling to afford it. The fund is State Street’s way of tapping the retail market, but it might be the last new dominant S&P 500 entrant. A new legal standing for marijuana could help change how ETFs track and invest in the cannabis industry. The company is planning to add 10 target-maturity ETFs. Vanguard and State Street have also moved to fill out their bond-ladder lines. With more than $1.4 trillion in flows and more than 1,000 product launches, it’s safe to say the industry is booming. Wanna bet? ETFs aren’t for gambling, but a rise in risk-on products could prove irresistible to a population obsessed with sports betting. After a dive, the company’s stock is still up 8% in 2025, while both long and short leveraged ETFs are down. The world’s largest asset manager and issuer of the biggest crypto ETF is expanding into staked Ethereum. Is there room for anyone else? Active fixed-income strategies accounted for nearly half of ETF inflows so far this year. Niche strategies, like buffer ETFs, could play a larger role in deal activity. Its price is up 100%, significantly ahead of gold’s surge, and the (very) few silver ETFs on the US market have benefited. The company’s flagship ETF, QQQ, is just shy of enough votes to approve its reclassification as an open-end fund. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: Barclays Sees ‘Down-Year’ for Crypto in 2026 Without Big Catalysts

Barclays expects a more tepid year for crypto in 2026, with trading volumes trending down and investor enthusiasm waning. In a wide-ranging year-end report published Friday, the bank flagged a difficult backdrop for digital asset exchanges like Coinbase (COIN), citing unclear catalysts for renewed activity and a slow start to token adoption efforts. Retail-facing exchanges, which benefited from surging trading interest during the crypto bull runs of prior years, are now facing a more subdued environment. Barclays analysts noted that trading volume in spot markets — key revenue drivers for companies like Coinbase and Robinhood (HOOD) — has cooled sharply. Without a clear spark to reignite demand, volumes may remain muted. "Spot crypto trading volumes [...] appear to be trending towards a down-year in FY26, and it is not clear to us what might reverse this trend," the analysts wrote. Crypto markets tend to move on big events: policy announcements, product launches or political changes. Barclays pointed to past bursts of activity, like the March 2024 spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) inflows or the pro-crypto presidential win in November as key drivers of short-term spikes. But in the absence of such events, the bank sees structural growth as lacking. One area that could stir the market is regulation. Barclays highlighted the pending CLARITY Act, legislation that would help define the line between digital commodities and securities and clarify which U.S. agency — the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or the smaller Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) — regulates which assets. While not a guaranteed market mover, the bill could ease operational uncertainty for crypto companies and investors alike. If passed, it could open the door for clearer product launches, especially in tokenized assets. Coinbase remains a focal point in Barclays’ analysis. While the company is expanding into derivatives and tokenized equity trading, the bank sees headwinds from shrinking spot volumes and rising operating costs. "COIN has a number [of] growth initiatives as well as recent acquisitions that could start to become more impactful," the report stated. Nevertheless, analysts revised their price target for the stock down to $291, citing a more conservative earnings outlook. Tokenization continues to gain attention from both crypto-native and traditional finance firms. BlackRock (BLK), Robinhood (HOOD), and others have been piloting products in this space. But Barclays cautions the trend is early-stage and unlikely to materially impact earnings in 2026. Meanwhile, the U.S. political environment has turned more favorable for digital assets following recent elections. However, Barclays sees much of this optimism already priced into the market. Any legislative movement, like the CLARITY Act, would need to pass through the Senate and survive possible legal challenges before having any practical impact. In sum, 2026 may be a transitional year for crypto. With declining retail activity and no immediate tailwinds, companies are focusing on long-term bets like tokenized finance and compliance upgrades. Whether those investments bear fruit next year or further out remains uncertain.

HPS, which is owned by the world's biggest asset manager, is among the parties in discussions with CVC Capital's Global Sports Group about a major debt financing deal, Sky News learns. City editor @MarkKleinmanSky Sunday 14 December 2025 12:27, UK A division of Blackrock, the world's biggest asset manager, is in talks to provide hundreds of millions of pounds of funding to a company which owns stakes in Six Nations Rugby and the women's professional tennis tour. Sky News has learnt that HPS, the global private credit giant, is among the parties negotiating with CVC Capital Partners over the financing of its Global Sports Group (GSG) holding company. The talks, which are not exclusive, would see HPS help provide firepower for the CVC-backed vehicle to make further acquisitions to expand its portfolio. Chaired by Marc Allera, the former BT Group consumer boss, GSG holds stakes in Premiership Rugby, the top flights of French and Spanish football and the international volleyball tour. In recent weeks, Mr Allera has outlined his ambitions to acquire further global sports properties. HPS, which was acquired by Blackrock for $12bn late last year, is said to be serious about becoming involved in GSG. Other parties with whom CVC is in discussions include Ares Management, which is interested in providing both debt and equity to GSG, according to insiders. Sharp inflation slowdown leaves door to interest rate cut wide open Pound tumbles after inflation falls by more than expected | Money blog Christmas cheer for Britain's biggest chemical plant, but there are two distinct problems Any new financing package was expected to be secured on favourable terms for the CVC-controlled group because of the underlying credit quality of the assets in the portfolio. Sky News revealed during the summer that CVC had engaged a trio of banks to explore plans for a refinancing of what was at the time referred to internally as SportsCo and which has since been renamed Global Sport Group. The portfolio also includes an Indian Premier League cricket franchise, several of which are currently exploring sales at valuations of well over $1bn. Goldman Sachs, PJT Partners and Raine Group are advising on the refinancing of GSG, which has been set up to optimise CVC's investments in the sector. The deal is expected to allow CVC to remain invested in its sports portfolio for longer, while also paving the way for the sale of a minority stake in SportsCo or a future initial public offering. Having made billions of dollars from its ownership of Formula One motor racing - one of the most lucrative deals in the history of sport - CVC has bought stakes in leagues and other assets spanning a spectrum of elite sporting assets over the last two decades. Its investment in the media rights to La Liga - Spain's equivalent of the Premier League - is expected to generate a handsome return for the firm, although a comparable deal in France has faced significant challenges amid broadcasters' financial challenges in the country. CVC's backing of global sports properties is intended to position it to maximise their commercial potential through new media and sponsorship rights deals, as well as their expansion into new formats aimed at drawing wider audiences amid rapid shifts in media consumption. In rugby union, its acquisition of a stake in Premiership Rugby's commercial rights was hit by the pandemic and the subsequent financial pressures on clubs which saw a number of the league's teams forced into insolvency. CVC, which bought into Premiership Rugby in 2019, owns a 27% stake in the league. Its sporting assets will continue to remain autonomous and independent of one another, despite the new umbrella holding entity. One expected benefit of the SportsCo approach would be the sourcing of new investment opportunities, with CVC being linked to a bid for one of the new European NBA basketball franchises which is expected to be sold in the coming months. Global sports properties have become one of the hottest growth areas for private capital in recent years, with firms such as Ares, Silver Lake Partners and Bridgepoint all investing substantial sums in teams, leagues and other assets across the industry. CVC and Blackrock declined to comment.

Title: Vanguard Executive Compares Bitcoin To A ‘Digital Labubu’ Even As Firm Allows Client Access To Crypto ETFs

A senior Vanguard executive has asserted that Bitcoin is a purely speculative asset, likening it to a collectible toy, even as the Wall Street behemoth opened the door to crypto-tied exchange-traded funds. Speaking during Bloomberg’s ETFs in Depth conference in New York on Thursday, Vanguard’s global head of quantitative equity, John Ameriks, said that Bitcoin lacked the cash flow and compounding traits the company sought when evaluating long-term investments. According to Ameriks, Bitcoin still resembles a speculative collectible rather than an asset meant to build long-term wealth. In fact, he characterized the world’s largest and oldest crypto as a “digital Labubu,” referencing the viral plush collectibles. “It’s difficult for me to think about Bitcoin as anything more than a digital Labubu,” the exec postulated, highlighting what he called the lack of clear evidence that the underlying blockchain technology provides long-lasting economic value. Bitcoin has long been likened to speculative manias and collectibles, including Dutch tulip bulbs and Beanie Babies. Detractors have pointed to those analogies to contend that Bitcoin’s price gains have been spurred more by speculation than by real-world use cases. Despite Ameriks’ dismissive view, he suggested that Bitcoin could find real-world use cases beyond market speculation in the future in scenarios of high inflation or political instability. The comments from Ameriks followed Vanguard’s announcement earlier this month, allowing its 50 million clients to access funds holding cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ether, Ripple’s XRP, and Solana. “We allow people to hold and buy these ETFs on our platform if they wish to do so, but they do so with discretion,” Ameriks noted, adding that even with that access, Vanguard will not offer clients “advice as to whether to buy or sell or which crypto tokens they ought to hold.” Vanguard had previously said it would steer clear of crypto-related products, including the spot BTC ETFs offered by rivals BlackRock and Fidelity. The firm’s decision to now allow digital assets on its platform demonstrates how the worlds of traditional finance and cryptocurrency are continuing to merge. Despite begrudgingly reversing course, Vanguard does not intend to roll out its own crypto ETFs. This is notable given that spot BTC funds have become BlackRock’s biggest revenue drivers.

Title: Bitcoin To Retest $85,000 Mark In Coming Days – Here’s Why

Amid a steady price rebound in the Bitcoin (BTC) market, popular market analyst with the X username KillaXBT is predicting another significant correction in the forthcoming days. In an X post on December 12, KillaXBT outlines a cautious market insight that suggests Bitcoin is headed for a price pullback. According to the renowned analyst, the premier cryptocurrency has consistently recorded an 8% price decline after the 14th day of the last five months. KillaXBT describes this observation as the 14th Pivot, which now holds important implications for Bitcoin in the short term. Since hitting a price bottom of $80,000 in late November, BTC has formed an ascending channel, recording a steady series of higher lows and higher highs. However, KillaXBT’s projection is expected to break this channel, potentially halting the nascent uptrend. Going by the recurring price pattern, the analyst states Bitcoin investors should anticipate a minimum 5% price decline after the 14th of December, hinting at a potential retest of the 85,000-$86,000 price zone. Given the asset’s broader bullish market structure, such a move may represent nothing more than a short-term pullback. However, the prolonged correction seen earlier in Q4 has already set a precedent, leaving room for another phase of deeper downside should momentum weaken. In another X post, KillaXBT shares more bearish projections of the Bitcoin market. This time, the seasoned analyst predicts the crypto market leader will hit a price bottom of $48,905 despite recent price gains. KillaXBT’s bottom target represents Bitcoin’s price as of the approval of the BlackRock IBIT ETF, alongside 11 other Bitcoin Spot ETFs in January 2024. This projection is likely due to the common rationale that the present bullish run has been heavily supported by institutional inflows. Notably, the Bitcoin Spot ETFs have been central to these institutional inflows, boasting total net assets of $119.18 billion. The BlackRock IBIT holds over half of this traction as the undisputed market leader with $71.03 billion in net assets and $62.68 billion in cumulative net inflows. If Bitcoin were to return to its pre-ETF approval price levels, it would imply an estimated 46% decline from current market prices. Such a move would likely signal a sharp reversal in institutional positioning, suggesting that sustained ETF outflows, rather than retail capitulation, could emerge as the primary catalyst for a renewed crypto winter. At press time, Bitcoin continues to trade at $90,348, reflecting a 2.18% decline. Featured image from Pexels, chart from Tradingview For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Ripple’s Brad Garlinghouse Shares Key Institutional Signal, Makes Bold XRP Prediction For 2026‬

Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has outlined what he considers one of the clearest signs that institutional capital is finally entering the crypto market, despite recent volatility. Speaking at Binance Blockchain Week alongside Solana Foundation President Lily Liu and Binance CEO Richard Teng, Garlinghouse said XRP ETFs have already raised over $700 million in just a few weeks. According to Ripple’s CEO, that surge reflects pent-up demand from institutions that previously avoided the asset due to a lack of U.S. regulatory clarity. Garlinghouse emphasized that the shift in U.S. policy has been dramatically under-priced. With the world’s largest economy representing 22% of global GDP, the removal of long-standing regulatory hostility marks a critical turning point. Major financial firms, including Franklin Templeton, BlackRock, and even Vanguard, which once refused to touch crypto, are now entering the space. That situation fuels Garlinghouse’s strongest optimism for 2026. That said, Brad Garlinghouse noted that crypto still represents just 1–2% of the global ETF market. He dismissed concerns about short-term ETF outflows and declared there is “no chance” the asset class remains this small by 2026. For Ripple’s institutional brokerage arm, the trend is already visible: firms that stayed sidelined due to risk aversion or regulatory uncertainty are now beginning to “crawl, then walk, then run.” Moving on, Garlinghouse said the recent market turbulence has not scared institutions. “Definitely not,” he told the panel, arguing that volatility is pulling more interest in rather than pushing capital out. On the payments front, the Ripple CEO highlighted the company’s growing stablecoin business, which recently surpassed a $1 billion market cap and has secured approvals in Abu Dhabi, Dubai, and the DIFC. The company is seeing accelerating demand for stablecoin-based treasury flows, boosted further by upcoming U.S. legislation such as the GENIUS Act. Moreso, Ripple’s acquisition of GTreasury is reinforcing that momentum. Looking ahead, Garlinghouse expects meaningful U.S. regulatory legislation to pass in the first half of 2026, setting up what he believes could be a transformational year for XRP and the broader market.

Title: Vanguard Exec Likens Bitcoin to ‘Digital Labubu’ Even as Firm Opens ETF Trading Access

Vanguard’s global head of quantitative equity, John Ameriks, said bitcoin BTC$86,672.60 still resembles a speculative collectible more than an asset meant to build long-term wealth, comparing it to a “digital Labubu,” the plush toy that has become a popular collectible. Ameriks’ words came during Bloomberg’s ETFs in Depth conference in New York on Thursday, where he said bitcoin lacks the income, compounding, and cash-flow traits Vanguard seeks when it evaluates long-term investments. His dismissive stance comes as Vanguard just opened its platform to crypto exchange-traded funds, allowing its 50 million clients access to regulated investment vehicles from rivals like BlackRock and Fidelity. The asset management giant's begrudging embrace of crypto is a reversal of long-time skepticism towards the entire asset class. For years, Vanguard stood against offering cryptocurrency products to clients, reiterating that it saw digital assets as highly speculative and unaligned with its core investment philosophy. That view, according to Ameriks, apparently hasn’t changed. As a result, Vanguard does not plan to launch its own crypto-focused ETFs. The decision is notable as bitcoin ETFs have become BlackRock’s top revenue source. Still, after Vanguard saw crypto ETFs and funds “have been tested through periods of market volatility, performing as designed while maintaining liquidity,” the firm opened its brokerage platform to these products. Even with that access, Vanguard will not advise clients on whether to buy or sell crypto assets or which tokens to hold, Ameriks said. Ameriks said bitcoin could eventually show non-speculative value in certain conditions, such as high inflation or political instability, but he argued the evidence is still limited. “You’ve still got too short of a history,” he said.
