Posted on 11/25/2025 9:34:18 AM PST by DFG There is “a very good chance” that President Trump names a replacement for Fed Chair Jerome Powell by Christmas, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Tuesday. Bessent, who has been leading search efforts for a new Fed leader, told CNBC he still has one interview left and is not ready to speculate on who might succeed Powell, whom Trump has said he’d “love” to fire. “I think there’s a very good chance that the president will make an announcement before Christmas,” said the Treasury secretary. “But it’s [Trump’s] prerogative, whether it’s before the Christmas holidays or in the new year. But I think things are moving along very well.” Finalists for the role reportedly include National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, current Fed Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, and Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock. Trump has been eager to replace Powell – whose term expires in May 2026 – after months of blasting the Fed chairman for not slashing rates quickly enough. Last week at the US-Saudi Investment Forum in Washington, DC, Trump said Powell has “mental problems” and he would love to “fire his ass,” but Bessent is holding him back. As the audience of investors, tech bros and foreign leaders laughed, Trump urged Bessent – who was in the crowd – to “work on this guy,” adding: “The rates are too high, Scott. And if you don’t get it fixed fast, I’m going to fire your ass, okay?” “If you were in the room, he was joking,” Bessent told CNBC on Tuesday. “We’ve gotten to this point where monetary policy has gotten very complicated, and it’s more than just cutting rates.” (Excerpt) Read more at nypost.com ...

Low rates raise inflation and encourage borrow & spend. 2 posted on 11/25/2025 9:42:06 AM PST by Angelino97 [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: DFG “We’ve gotten to this point where monetary policy has gotten very complicated, and it’s more than just cutting rates.” I'm certainly no expert, but I see the entire global economic system as a complete house of cards. It's all debt. There is no way out. We just limp and limp and limp forward. It's going to come crashing down at some point. They will try to force us to a cashless CBDC system as a way to magically make debt go away, but I don't think that's going to work. It's all "gotten very complicated". 3 posted on 11/25/2025 9:47:11 AM PST by ClearCase_guy (Democrats seek power through cheating and assassination. They are sociopaths. They just want power.)

It's all "gotten very complicated". 3 posted on 11/25/2025 9:47:11 AM PST by ClearCase_guy (Democrats seek power through cheating and assassination. They are sociopaths. They just want power.)

Title: Trump could make a decision on a new Fed chair 'before Christmas.' See who's on the short list

Every time Brent D. Griffiths publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. President Donald Trump is checking his list of potential Federal Reserve chairs twice. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who has been leading the search, said that Trump could name his nominee to replace Fed Chair Jerome Powell by Christmas. "I think there's a very good chance that the president will make an announcement before Christmas," Bessent told CNBC in late November. "But it's his prerogative, whether it's before the Christmas holidays or in the new year. But I think things are moving along very well." No matter who Trump selects, Bessent said he wants a less prominent central bank. "I think it's time for the Fed just to move back into the background, like, it used to do, calm things down and work for the American people," Bessent said. Powell's term expires next May, but hasn't stopped the White House from aggressively searching for his replacement. Here are the five finalists. Before joining Trump's orbit, Kevin Hassett advised a succession of Republican presidential nominees on economic policy, including George W. Bush, John McCain, and Mitt Romney. Just before Thanksgiving, Hassett briefly lost his lead among the contenders on leading prediction markets. After a Bloomberg News report said he was the frontrunner, Hassett shot back up into first on Kalshi and Polymarket. As of November 25th, he has a double-digit advantage on both platforms. During Trump's first term, Hassett served as director of the president's Council of Economic Advisors. He returned to the White House during the COVID-19 pandemic and was severely criticized for publishing a model showing coronavirus deaths hitting zero by May 15, 2020. In October 1999, Hassett cowrote with journalist Jason Glassman "Dow 36,000: The New Strategy for Profiting From the Coming Rise in the Stock Market." Some economists have heavily criticized the book, largely because the index took more than 22 years to reach that threshold. Fed Gov. Christopher Waller told Fox News that he thought his most recent conversation with Bessent went well. "I talked to Scott about 10 days ago. We had a nice, a great, meeting," Waller told Fox Business in late November. Waller said that the White House is looking for someone with "experience." It's not clear what experience that entails, but of the reported finalists, only three have experience serving on the central bank. "I think they are looking for someone who has merit, experience, and knows what they are doing in the job, and I think I fit that," he said. Just before Thanksgiving, Waller briefly dethroned White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett as the favorite of leading prediction markets. Waller's lead was short-lived as Hassett quickly supplanted him. Waller, a longtime regional Fed official, was seen as a convention pick when Trump nominated him to the central bank in 2019. Simultaneously, Trump also nominated Judy Shelton, a former campaign advisor and a Fed critic. The fight over Shelton's nomination soon spilled over onto Waller's. In December 2020, the Senate confirmed Waller 48-47, the narrowest margin for any Fed governor since 1980, per The New York Times. In July, Waller joined Gov. Michelle Bowman (another Trump first-term pick) in opposing the Fed's decision not to cut interest rates, the first dual dissent in more than 30 years. Trump told reporters in September that Hassett, Waller, and Warsh were "the top three" to replace Powell. Back in his first term, Trump reportedly considered Warsh to lead the Fed before he chose to nominate Powell in 2017. Warsh spent his early years at Morgan Stanley, working as a specialist in mergers and acquisitions. President George W. Bush nominated him to the Fed in 2006 after Warsh served as an economic advisor in the Bush White House. Drawing on his Wall Street ties, Warsh played a pivotal role in the central bank's response to the 2008 global financial crisis. When he left the Fed in 2011, the Times called him the Fed's chief liaison to Wall Street. From the sidelines, Warsh has echoed Trump's criticism of Powell, calling for "regime change" at the Fed. "The specter of the miss they made on inflation, it has stuck with them," Warsh told CNBC in July. "So one of the reasons why the president, I think, is right to be pushing the Fed publicly is we need regime change in the conduct of policy." In 2018, Trump appointed Federal Reserve Gov. Michelle Bowman to the central bank. After confirmation, she was reappointed in 2020. In June, she was narrowly confirmed as the vice chair of supervision. Bowman started as an intern for Sen. Bob Dole. During the George W. Bush administration, she held posts at FEMA and the Homeland Security Department. She was vice president at Farmers and Drovers Bank in Kansas, her family's bank, before becoming the state's top banking official. In September 2024, Bowman became the first Fed governor to vote against an interest rate decision since 2005. In July, she again voted against holding rates steady, though this time Waller joined her dissent. There's also a big Wall Street name on Trump's shortlist. Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock, has spent decades on Wall Street, dating back to his time at Lehman Brothers. Rieder is responsible for managing roughly $2.4 trillion in assets, per BlackRock. He's served as a member of the Fed's Investment Advisory Committee on Financial Markets. Trump's shortlist at one point reportedly had almost a dozen names. CNBC previously reported that the following are no longer under consideration: David Zervos, Managing Director and Chief Market Strategist at Jefferies; Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan; former St. Louis Fed President James "Jim" Bullard; Fed Gov. Philip Jefferson; and Marc Sumerlin, a former economic advisor to President George W. Bush. Former Fed Gov. Larry Lindsey told CNBC that he withdrew from contention. Jump to

A Dublin-based Chinese businessman has been jailed for seven years and nine months over a money-laundering operation connected to an international €10 million “zombie” iPhone fraud. Chengwen Guo (43), who was described in court as the “Irish representative of a transnational crime organisation”, pleaded guilty at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court to theft and money-laundering offences on dates between 2021 and 2022. Guo, of Ivy Exchange, Parnell Street, Dublin, owned a number of mobile phone shops called Murray Mobile, with eight stores in locations including Blackrock, Dundrum, Sutton Cross, Ranelagh and Newbridge. Guo has one previous conviction for having a false passport at Gatwick Airport in the UK, for which he received a custodial sentence of 13 months, the court was told. The court heard three sums of money seized in January 2022 included €6,515 found in an Audi Q7 car registered to Guo; €143,245 at his home address; and €20,700 at Murray Mobiles on Main Street in Dundrum, Dublin 14. Three Rolex watches were also found when gardaí searched his Parnell Street apartment in Dublin. His Audi has yet to be seized, the court heard. Judge Martin Nolan described Guo as “a very energetic man” who had engaged in “very substantial criminal misbehaviour”. “This man deserves a severe custodial sentence,” said Judge Nolan. The judge said it was “white-collar deviance”. The judge said “there was a gap there” and “the situation was found out”. The court was told the fake or “zombie” phones from China were exchanged under warranty for genuine iPhones which were then sent to countries outside of the EU for resale. The court heard 10,158 phones provided to Guo were last active mostly outside Ireland. The total retail value of the Apple products was €10,262,617. Det Sgt Robert Madden of the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau told the court that representatives from Apple Corporation were in court for the hearing. The scheme operated on the basis of the Apple warranty on its phones. The fraud involved sending in fake iPhones for repair and then claiming a replacement under Apple’s one-year warranty scheme. These fake phone components would come from China and would be assigned the EMEI number of a genuine iPhone when sent for repair. The replacement genuine iPhones would then be sent to Hong Kong for resale to countries outside the EU. The court heard Guo also sold counterfeit Apple products such as power chargers, charging cables and phone cases in his shops. In July 2021, counterfeit Apple goods, including 15 damaged iPhones and sim trays, were found after a package was sent to Ireland addressed to “Johnny Cheng” – which the court heard was a name the defendant used in Ireland for its simplicity rather than his Chinese name – at Murray Mobile in Main Street, Dundrum. Gardaí commenced an investigation and searches of all eight Murray Mobile shops took place on January 10th, 2022. Last month, Guo’s co-accused, who was an employee of Fonfix, a tech repair business in Sandyford, south Dublin, was jailed in the same court. Lukasz Lupa (45) of Kukukcza, Wagrowiec, Poland was given a 4½-year prison sentence after pleading guilty to two counts of facilitating a criminal organisation on dates between June 5th, 2019, and September 3rd, 2021, under section 72 of the Criminal Justice Act, 2006. Lupa had claimed he did not know what he was doing was illegal and received little financial benefit for his part in the warranty fraud. Det Sgt Madden said Apple realised that the number of units Guo was sending in was unusually high. He told Eoin Lawlor SC, prosecuting, the phones would not power on and a diagnostic could not be performed on them. The phones were submitted without proof of purchase in the name of a company that runs a legitimate business and was not at fault, the court heard. Guo received brand new phones and was getting €30 to €40 per unit. Diana Stuart SC, defending, told the court in mitigation that Guo has four children. One is in boarding school in the UK and one is in boarding school in Ireland. He also has a child in university in Edinburgh. His wife’s day-to-day living expenses amount to €1,000 a week, Ms Stuart told the court. Judge Nolan said the appropriate global sentence was one of seven years and nine months.

Title: Mother killed in attack near her Cork home had ‘inbuilt generosity’, funeral told

Mother of four Stella Gallagher had an “inbuilt generosity” and was always giving of herself and helping others, mourners at her funeral mass have heard. Her brother-in-law, Alan Gallagher, spoke with emotion as he delivered a eulogy to mourners, led by Ms Gallagher’s husband, Brian, and their daughter and sons, Ciara, Conor and Mark, at her funeral mass in Cork city on Tuesday. Ms Gallagher (59) was fatally injured and her 63-year-old husband suffered serious injuries when they were attacked near their home at Shrewsbury Downs in Ballinlough, Cork, on November 17th. Alan Gallagher told mourners at a packed Our Lady of Lourdes Church how he had asked his brother, niece and nephews what memories they had of Ms Gallagher and they said: “Stella had 30 wonderful years of life with her family.” He said: “Stella loved meeting people and chatting with them, whether her many relatives, cousins and second cousins, or someone she had just met. She loved going on outings with people, whether for a hike in the country or to a film or on a shopping trip. “She had an inbuilt generosity and was always doing things for others or giving them things. If you mentioned in passing you liked something, the next time you saw her she’d have bought them for you or baked them for you or whatever. “It was the same when Stella was cooking food. When cooking for two people, she cooked enough for six. If you mentioned you had to go into town later, she’d get her car keys and offer to drop you in.” Mr Gallagher recalled the great pleasure and joy his sister-in-law derived from her involvement with the Togher Community Garden and the Cork Health Education Project Choir, based in nearby Blackrock, with whom she sang. “Stella was an excellent baker, and got pleasure from giving you scones or sourdough bread or apple tarts and she’d come in after losing track of time in her garden, delighted to be able to present you with her harvest of blackcurrants or potatoes or beetroot or whatever was in season. “Stella seemed to know the name of every flower and every tree, and on a recent visit to JFK Arboretum in Wexford she was like a child in a sweet shop. “We are so grateful to have shared our lives with this lovely person. We love you, Stella, and we always will.” Celebrant Msgr Gearóid Dullea told mourners when people were confronted with death they experienced a maelstrom of emotions, and he said the shock and sadness over Ms Gallagher’s death spread far beyond her family and the community in Ballinlough. “Stella’s shocking death has brought a great pall of darkness, not only over the Gallagher and Griffin families, but also on so many others – Stella’s colleagues from her work in Eli Lilly, the local communities in Ballinlough and Ballinspittle and over many friends.” Taoiseach Michéal Martin, who lives nearby in Ballinlough and spoke last week of how devastated the Gallagher family must be, was represented at the funeral his Aide de Camp, Comdt Joe Glennon. Ms Gallagher’s eldest son, David Gallagher (25), of Shrewsbury Downs, Ballinlough, is due to reappear at Cork District Court on Wednesday. He was charged last week with his mother’s murder and with assault causing harm to his father, Brian Gallagher, at Shrewsbury Downs on November 17th.

Title: Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says there’s ‘very good chance’ Trump names new Fed chair by Christmas

Time Published: 2025-11-25T15:38:35Z
Full Content:
There is “a very good chance” that President Trump names a replacement for Fed Chair Jerome Powell by Christmas, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Tuesday. Bessent, who has been leading search efforts for a new Fed leader, told CNBC he still has one interview left and is not ready to speculate on who might succeed Powell, whom Trump has said he’d “love” to fire. But White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett is reportedly seen by advisers and allies of Trump as the frontrunner, sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. “I think there’s a very good chance that the president will make an announcement before Christmas,” said the Treasury secretary. “But it’s [Trump’s] prerogative, whether it’s before the Christmas holidays or in the new year. But I think things are moving along very well.” Finalists for the role reportedly include Hassett, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, current Fed Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, and Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock. Trump has been eager to replace Powell – whose term expires in May 2026 – after months of blasting the Fed chairman for not slashing rates quickly enough. Last week at the US-Saudi Investment Forum in Washington, DC, Trump said Powell has “mental problems” and he would love to “fire his ass,” but Bessent is holding him back. As the audience of investors, tech bros and foreign leaders laughed, Trump urged Bessent – who was in the crowd – to “work on this guy,” adding: “The rates are too high, Scott. And if you don’t get it fixed fast, I’m going to fire your ass, okay?” Sign up to receive On The Money by Charlie Gasparino in your inbox every Thursday. Please provide a valid email.

Never miss a story. “If you were in the room, he was joking,” Bessent told CNBC on Tuesday. “We’ve gotten to this point where monetary policy has gotten very complicated, and it’s more than just cutting rates.” Hassett appears to agree with Trump’s view of the economy, including that interest rates need to come down. He told Fox News during an interview on Nov. 20 that he would “be cutting rates right now” if he were the Fed chairman because “the data suggests that we should.” Hassett has also criticized central bankers for losing control of inflation. Fed officials, meanwhile, have been split on whether to cut interest rates further after two consecutive quarter-point cuts at the September and October meetings, down to the 3.75% to 4% range. Markets rebounded after New York Fed President John Williams said Friday there is room for “further adjustment in the near term” to interest rates. Traders are currently betting on 83% odds of a quarter-point cut at the Dec. 10 meeting, according to CME FedWatch. But Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan on Friday called for holding rates “for a time,” and Boston Fed President Susan Collins said she was “hesitant” about the next policy move since “restrictive policy is very appropriate right now.” Philadelphia Fed President Anna Paulson said she’s approaching the December meeting “cautiously.” But Fed Governor Stephen Miran has said he would vote for a quarter-point cut if that meant the difference in getting lower rates. He has previously dissented in favor of a larger cut. Meanwhile, Bessent said he is hoping for the next chairman to bring the role into a new era. “I think we’ve got to kind of simplify things,” he said Tuesday. “I think it’s time for the Fed just to move back into the background, like, it used to do, calm things down and work for the American people.” Advertisement

Title: Best Crypto to Buy as Ondo Finance Puts $25M Into YLDS Tokenized Fund
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/best-crypto-to-buy-as-ondo-finance-makes-25m-tokenized-fund/
Time Published: 2025-11-25T14:50:53Z

Quick Facts: Ondo Finance just injected $25M into YLDS, a yield-bearing stablecoin issued by Figure Technology Solutions, to diversify the assets backing its tokenized U.S. Treasury fund. YLDS will join an exclusivist portfolio which also includes assets from BlackRock, Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton. It’s a textbook signal that serious capital is leaning further into tokenized Real-World Assets (RWA) and crypto-backed lending as a core part of modern market infrastructure. The winners are likely to be the tools and tokens that sit directly on those flows. So, as interest for RWAs grows, the best crypto to buy next focuses less on hype and more on who is building the plumbing. With that lens, three projects stand out in the current market: Best Wallet Token ($BEST) as a next-gen wallet layer onboarding everyday users, SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) as an AI-plus-Web3 content economy play, and XRP ($XRP) as the institutional cross-border backbone to fuel efficient crypto transfers. As tokenized treasuries, yield-bearing stablecoins, and onchain credit markets expand, the bottleneck is no longer just liquidity – it’s UX and security. Best Wallet steps in to solve this issue with a mobile-first, non-custodial wallet that aims to capture 40% of the crypto wallet market by the end of 2026. The $BEST token provides in-app utility for holders using this wallet layer. For example, $BEST unlocks first-stage presale access in the Upcoming Tokens portal. Here, early buyers can check vetted presales with a simplified purchase flow, effectively turning the wallet into a vetted deal-launchpad for emerging opportunities. Economically, the presale has already raised over $17.4M with $BEST sitting at $0.025995, signaling meaningful traction at seed-stage valuations. Based on Best Wallet’s value proposition, our price prediction for $BEST puts the token at $0.072 by the end of 2025. That makes up for a 175% ROI potential for EOY investment. In a favorable market context, the numbers can go higher, especially if Best Wallet sees mainstream adoption. Note that the presale only has three days left, so slots are running out. Buy $BEST today before the presale ends. While DeFi chases yields, the $85B content-creation industry is quietly shifting toward models where creators actually own their output and audience data. SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) targets that gap by merging Web3 payments with AI-native tools, giving creators both lower platform fees and more control over monetization. The presale has already raised over $1.3M+ at a token price of $0.057025, suggesting early conviction in the thesis that creators will follow better economics. Given that the project is planning to onboard the top 2,000+ highest-earning creators, we expect SUBBD to see massive post-launch adoption. From a growth-sector perspective, SUBBD is a leveraged bet on AI + creator monetization rather than just number-go-up memetics. As onchain finance broadens, attention remains the most scarce resource – SUBBD is building rails to tokenize it. Buy $SUBBD from the official presale today. On the institutional side of this market shift, XRP ($XRP) sits in a privileged position. XRP is designed specifically for fast, low-cost cross-border payments and liquidity provisioning for financial institutions, settling transactions on the XRP Ledger in around 3-5 seconds with minimal fees suitable for high-volume flows. $XRP is also a top-five cryptocurrency by market cap and a leading asset in the blockchain-based payments sector, making it a more mature, lower-volatility way to express a view on the continued growth of onchain settlement rails. The project’s profile lines up directly with the kind of tokenized treasuries and yield-bearing stablecoin activity Ondo’s move highlights. As more traditional finance players look for instant, global settlement of tokenized assets, they need enterprise-grade infrastructure, which Ripple has spent years building – from compliance tooling to bank integrations and payment corridors. In November 2025, Ripple raised $500M at a $40B valuation to expand institutional XRP use and deepen its footprint in payments. Find $XRP on Binance today. This is not financial advice.

Title: 21Shares taps Standard Chartered for custody as TradFi tightens grip on crypto
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/standard-chartered-21shares-crypto-custody-shift
Time Published: 2025-11-25T14:37:56Z

Standard Chartered will provide digital asset custody for 21Shares, signaling deeper expansion into crypto by traditional financial players. Update (Nov. 26, 2025, at 8:30 am UTC): This article has been updated to add commentary by Alistair Byas-Perry, head of EU investments and capital markets at 21Shares and Julian Sawyer, CEO of Zodia Custody. Major bank Standard Chartered announced fund manager 21Shares has selected it as its digital asset custodian, potentially moving away from a crypto-native partner. According to a Monday announcement from Standard Chartered shared with Cointelegraph, the bank will provide crypto custody services to 21Shares, which offers multiple exchange-traded crypto products. Margaret Harwood-Jones, the bank’s global head of financing and securities services, said the collaboration allows them to “to extend our expertise into the fast-evolving digital asset ecosystem.” However, 21Shares already had a crypto-native custody partner. In late June 2024, the fund manager partnered with crypto-native custodian Zodia Custody to hold its assets. Zodia Custody was co-founded by Standard Chartered in 2020 and operated as a wholly owned subsidiary, indicating that the bank wanted to avoid direct involvement in crypto at the time. Julian Sawyer, CEO of Zodia Custody, said that the company views Standard Chartered’s appointment “as a positive sign of the industry’s continued maturity.” He also explained that “Standard Chartered’s custody offering employs Zodia Custody’s underlying technology and risk frameworks.” The move comes as more traditional financial institutions roll out crypto services, often with reputational advantages over crypto-native competitors. Still, Alistair Byas-Perry, head of EU investments and capital markets at 21Shares, told Cointelegraph that this is not a shift from existing partners. Instead, “adding Standard Chartered simply expands our multi-custodian model.” He said: Byas-Perry also said that “21Shares continues to work with leading crypto-native custodians.” He explained that the fund manager chose Standard Chartered “because of their global reputation, regulatory footprint, and risk-management standards” and added: Byas-Perry explained that “some institutions prefer working with names they already know, while others rely on crypto-native specialists.” Still, he believes that 21Shares’ “job is to support both.” Standard Chartered had not answered Cointelegraph’s request for comment by publication. Related: BlackRock quietly accumulated 3% of all Bitcoin. Here’s what that means Standard Chartered said 21Shares will work with its newly established digital asset custody service based in Luxembourg. The announcement follows the bank’s mid-July launch of a trading service that allows institutions and corporations to trade major cryptocurrencies. 21Shares’ global head of product development, Mandy Chiu, said the collaboration is “an important milestone in our continued mission to bring institutional-grade infrastructure to the digital asset ecosystem.” She pointed to the bank’s reputation in traditional finance as an advantage. Other major banks have taken similar steps. In September, US multinational financial services firm US Bancorp reentered the crypto space by relaunching its digital asset custody services aimed explicitly at investment managers. This follows the company’s launch of its custody service in 2021, which was subsequently shut down due to unfavorable regulations. Mid-August reports also note that Wall Street giant Citigroup is weighing plans to offer cryptocurrency custody and payment services. In July, Germany’s biggest bank, Deutsche Bank, was also reported to be planning to allow its clients to store cryptocurrencies — amid a broader trend in the nation. Related: US Federal agencies outline key risks for banks eyeing crypto custody That trend has stirred debate within the industry, as crypto-native institutions face intense competition. In October, Martin Hiesboeck, head of blockchain and crypto research at crypto financial services platform Uphold, said that large Bitcoin (BTC) wallets moving their assets into ETFs is “another nail in the coffin of the original crypto spirit.” The comment follows Robbie Mitchnick, BlackRock’s head of digital assets, saying that the company had already facilitated more than $3 billion worth of real Bitcoin to ETF conversions. He added that holders recognize “the convenience of being able to hold their exposure within their existing financial adviser or private-bank relationship.” Magazine: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in stablecoin fight Cointelegraph is committed to providing independent, high-quality journalism across the crypto, blockchain, AI, and fintech industries.

Title: BlackRock’s $400 Million Bitcoin Move Sparks Liquidity Alarm | US Crypto News

Written byLockridge Okoth Edited byMohammad Shahid Welcome to the US Crypto News Morning Briefing—your essential rundown of the most important developments in crypto for the day ahead. Grab a coffee as markets enter an unusual phase where large players are repositioning and liquidity is tightening. Against this backdrop, the timing of one major transfer has raised fresh questions about what might be coming next for Bitcoin. BlackRock quietly moved 4,471 BTC to Coinbase Prime, hours before the PPI report. The move comes as its flagship Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, logged record monthly outflows. BlackRock just deposited another 4,471 $BTC($390.8M) to #CoinbasePrime.https://t.co/qmuDIrPHc6 pic.twitter.com/3CqgyHozVC The timing has ignited a new debate: Is the world’s biggest asset manager preparing for a deeper US liquidity shock? Arkham data shows the same wallet has fallen from a $117 billion peak to $78.4 billion, losing more than 30% of its value over the past month. The transfer occurs at a time of increasing stress across Bitcoin markets, with analysts like Crypto Rover noting that BlackRock’s move could exacerbate selling. Meanwhile, the timing ahead of the US PPI has also raised concern. Meanwhile,VanEck’s Matthew Sigel sees the Bitcoin price’s ongoing struggle as primarily a macro dynamic, calling it an “overwhelmingly a US-session phenomenon. “…The driver: tightening US liquidity and widening credit spreads as AI-capex fears collided with a more fragile funding market,” he stated. This aligns with recent stress across equities, credit, and rate-sensitive assets. Traders are watching whether the November PPI print, due just after the BTC transfer, signals further tightening. However, ARK Invest’s Cathie Wood argues the current liquidity pressure is temporary. “The liquidity squeeze that has hit AI and crypto will reverse in the next few weeks,” she said. The Ark Invest executive cited a 123% surge in Palantir’s US commercial business, calling it evidence that enterprise adoption is accelerating despite macro headwinds. The blockchain activity comes as BlackRock’s IBIT posts its worst outflow month on record, over $2 billion this month. Analysts highlight it as the biggest withdrawal wave since launch. “…After months of steady inflows, the outflows reflect rising caution as Bitcoin falls ~22% over the past month and 7% year-to-date,” wrote Walter Bloomberg. However, ETF analyst Eric Balchunas pushed back on the panic, stressing that context is being lost. According to the analyst, the majority of investors are sticking around despite the outflows. That’s bc it never had outflows bf! All told the “record” is 3% of aum. The real story (that you def won’t see in ALL CAPS let alone in the media at large) is 97% of investors are sticking around despite not starting the -35% fire. https://t.co/2p0c5gJIji He also highlighted the collapse in short interest, ascribing plummeting IBIT short interest to traders who tend to short into strength and cover in downturns. In other words, despite headlines screaming about “record outflows,” the majority of institutional holders appear to be staying put. BlackRock’s IBIT ETF Flow Data.

November 25, 2025 (Bloomberg) -- Private markets will generate more than half of the money-management industry’s revenues by 2030, an increase that reflects the intensifying competition among firms to expand in private debt and equity and infrastructure, according to PwC. “The winners won’t be those who gather the most assets, but those who rewire the fastest,” Albertha Charles, global asset and wealth management leader at PwC UK, said Monday in a report that surveyed 300 global firms and investors. The asset- and wealth-management industry will take in about $432 billion in revenue from private assets in 2030, exceeding the totals for traditional actively managed investments and for passive products, the consultancy found. In 2024, private assets accounted for 44% of total revenue, with traditional investments making up most of the industry total, according to PwC. Still, private markets have become increasingly crowded. Many traditional fund houses — including Franklin Resources Inc., Invesco Ltd. and State Street Corp. — have acquired or partnered with private-markets firms recently to gain a foothold. BlackRock Inc. has spent more than $25 billion since the start of 2024 to grow in private credit and infrastructure and compete with the likes of Blackstone Inc., Apollo Global Management Inc. and Ares Management Corp. Related:Rowan Says People ‘Lost Their Minds’ Over Private Credit Fears The asset management industry is also facing unrelenting fee pressure on traditional stock, bond, money-market and multi-asset funds, with almost 60% of institutional investors surveyed by PwC saying they’re likely or very likely to replace a manager solely for cost reasons. As a result, fees are expected to decline across active and passive strategies, even while costs remain stubbornly high. “Traditional cost-cutting has barely made a dent,” PwC said. “Diversifying into new asset classes and expanding into new markets add cost and complexity.” Fast forward five years, though, and technology will help drive profits in an industry with ever-narrowing margins, according to PwC. “Asset managers see AI integration and automation as the most important actions they’re taking today to transform and future-proof their business models for 2030,” the firm said in the report.

November 25, 2025 09:12 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, Nov. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Strategic Intelligence: Artificial Intelligence in Financial Services 2025" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.This report provides an overview of the current state of artificial intelligence (AI) innovation in the financial services industry. It examines the forecasted size of the AI market, delving into specific types of AI spend (such as generative AI, computer vision, and agentic AI). The report lists different ways of utilizing AI to combat fraud, cyberattacks, evolving regulation, bad user experience, growing volumes of transactional data, and new attack vectors. It provides new case studies of innovative uses of AI within the industry, while providing company profiles of the leading AI adopters and specialist vendors across the insurance, banking, payments, and wealth management industries.AI adoption in financial services has ramped up significantly in the last few years. Financial services firms have long adopted generative AI tools for customer service and improved decision making, yet sustained direct profitability remains far off. The recent boom of agentic AI investment has necessitated financial services companies to reconsider all of their AI pilots, to govern deployments like product launches: require return on investment gates, scale what demonstrably pays, and sunset what does not. Financial services firms must adopt AI to improve cybersecurity and fraud prevention in the face of adaptive cyberattacks, new attack vectors, and rising insider threats.Report Scope Reasons to Buy Key Topics Covered: 1.

Title: 'Shocked, stunned' - locals gather for Gallagher funeral

Time Published: 2025-11-25T13:19:18Z

The funeral mass of a 59-year-old woman who died after an attack near her home in Ballinlough in Cork city earlier this month has heard that she brought "goodness and beauty to this world". Family, friends and members of the local community gathered at Our Lady of Lourdes Church in Ballinlough today for the funeral mass of Stella Gallagher. Her husband Brian Gallagher, who was also injured in the attack, was at the mass along with the couple's adult children Ciara, Conor and Mark. Brian Gallagher was among the pallbearers who carried the coffin out of the church at the conclusion of the service for burial at St Michael's cemetery in nearby Blackrock. Alan Gallagher, a brother-in-law of Stella Gallagher, said a few words on behalf of his brother Brian during the requiem mass. Mr Gallagher said Stella had 30 wonderful years of life with her family. "When I asked them what some of their good memories of Stella were, they looked back at me and said they were all good. She was a joy to be around and great fun. She was game for anything and would go anywhere and have a good time." Mr Gallagher emphasised that Stella loved meeting people and chatting with them. "Whether her many relatives, cousins and second cousins, or someone she had just met. She loved going on outings with people, whether for a hike in the country or to a film or on a shopping trip." Mr Gallagher also recalled the activities that made Stella "really light up with joy" including singing, gardening and baking. "We are so grateful to have shared our lives with this lovely person. We love you, Stella, and we always will." Mr Gallagher closed his eulogy with a few lines by American short story writer Raymond Carver. "And did you get what you wanted from this life, even so? I did. And what did you want? To call myself beloved, to feel myself beloved on the Earth." Meanwhile, Monsignor Gearóid Dullea, co-parish priest in Ballinlough, told mourners that the death of Stella had left her loved ones "broken hearted" and "bewildered". He stated that her "shocking death" had brought a "great pall of sadness" not only over the Gallagher and Griffin families but also on the wider community. "Stella’s colleagues from her work in Eli Lilly, the local communities in Ballinlough and Ballinspittle, her friends and the Togher Community Garden and her fellow singers in the SHEP choir. Stella’s death has shocked us, stunned us and shaken us. "Stella was deeply loved as wife, as mother, as sister, as daughter-in-law, as sister-in-law, as aunt, as cousin, as friend. She was a positive person, often humming a song, with a quiet religious faith," he said. Offertory gifts included apples representing Stella’s love of gardening, sourdough signifying her enjoyment of baking, sheet music arising of her fondness for music and a gift box symbolising her generous and giving nature. Monsignor Dullea celebrated the mass alongside Fr Gerard Dunne and Rev Alan Marley, both of whom were representing University College Cork. Taoiseach Micheál Martin was represented by his Aide de Camp, Commandant Joe Glennon. © RTÉ 2025. RTÉ.ie is the website of Raidió Teilifís Éireann, Ireland's National Public Service Media.

Title: Crypto ETF flows: BTC sees $151M outflows as ETH and SOL funds thrive

The cryptocurrency sector remains weak as bearish sentiments prevail. Indeed, recent price drops, muted trading activities, and worries about short-term recoveries have seen many investors adopt a defensive bias. Exchange-traded funds flow data reflects this uncertainty, with Bitcoin recording massive withdrawals as altcoin products hold steady. Let us find out more. BTC spot ETFs had a rough session on Monday, with net outflows totaling $151 million, according to SoSoValue. That signals deteriorated interest in these financial products, which have played a key role in institutional crypto adoption. Meanwhile, Fidelity’s FBTC stood out as it posted positive ETF flows of $15.49 million on Monday amidst the broader retreat. On the other hand, BlackRock has struggled lately, with iShares’ outflows surpassing $2.2 billion so far in November. Meanwhile, the mixed ETF outflows come as the Bitcoin price experiences notable downward pressure. The bellwether crypto is trading at $88,190, down from late last month’s high above $115,500. While investors remain more conservative about Bitcoin, Ethereum thrived. Data shows Ether ETFs attracted $96.67 million in inflows yesterday, with BlackRock’s ETHA dominating at $92.61 million. Ethereum seems to thrive as Bitcoin struggles, as narratives like the latest attacks on Strategy by JPMorgan magnified uncertainty in BTC-based financial products. Institutions are seemingly migrating to Ethereum, possibly indicating renewed trust in its unique role in powering scaling solutions, decentralized apps (dApps), and support for new infrastructure. ETH is changing hands at $2,925 after gaining 3% the past 24 hours. It lost more than 2% the past week. Solana held its ground, attracting net inflows of $57.99 million on November 24. The altcoin has seen positive ETF flows since its debut, highlighting steady institutional demand. For instance, Bitwise’s Solana spot exchange-traded fund surpassed $500 million AUM last week. Solana experienced amplified institutional interest due to its robust network that prioritizes scalability, speed, and security. The team spent the past years rewriting Solana’s reputation, darkened by previous network outages. Now, the blockchain exhibits a thriving developer community, booming app usage, and Solana-based tokens. With these factors, Solana has carved a unique lane in the blockchain industry. SOL is trading at $138 after soaring 5% in the last 24 hours. The altcoin lost nearly 30% of its value over the past month. Meanwhile, Solana inflow confirms investors looking beyond price performance while prioritizing long-term potential. Meanwhile, the latest ETF flow statistics highlight a split market. Investors are now exploring crypto offerings beyond Bitcoin. Institutional investors are no longer treating all cryptocurrencies the same. They’re now evaluating every project based on solid catalysts, narratives, and momentum.

Title: What happened to crypto market today – Mild recovery, but where is smart money?

Rebound on bid support, smart money still on the sidelines. Despite a mild rebound, extreme fear shows that broader capital hasn’t entered the crypto market today, keeping smart money cautious. Bullish signs like rising whale holdings and institutional interest in DOGE/XRP ETFs indicate the market still has upside potential. The crypto market today registered a mild rebound. Bitcoin [BTC] retested $88,000, sparking debate over whether it has bottomed or if selling pressure is still weighing on the market. Ethereum [ETH] followed, climbing back above $2,800. All in all, has the market turned bullish? On the macro side, nearly $50 billion flowed into the crypto market over the last 24 hours. Notably, $30 billion of that went straight into Bitcoin. That’s 60% of inflows, a sign that traders are still favoring BTC over altcoins, keeping this cycle BTC-led. The result? The Altcoin Season Index slipped by 3 points to 39. In short, the minor rebound of the crypto market today isn’t broad-based. The inflows seemed to be too concentrated, making it premature to call a market bottom yet, with the TOTAL index already down 0.38% intraday. Source: TradingView (TOTAL/USDT) Simply put, the overall market participation has been cautious. BlackRock, for example, has been selling aggressively, moving 2,822 BTC and 36k ETH into Coinbase Prime. On the ETF side, inflows for both BTC and ETH have been flat, showing that big money isn’t jumping in yet. Reinforcing this, the Fear and Greed Index ticked up just 2 points to 12. However, it’s still in “extreme” fear, matching market positioning, with 95% of 24-hour liquidations in the crypto market today coming from longs. Despite bearish signals though, the crypto market today did see some signs of optimism. On the institutional front, Grayscale’s Dogecoin [DOGE] and Ripple [XRP] ETFs grabbed attention, reinforcing confidence in digital assets. Backing this trend, a prominent analyst challenged the idea of a market top. For one, 560k BTC flowed off CEXs, pushing reserves to an eight-year low. Meanwhile, whales holding over 10k BTC hit a five-month high – A sign that even in a risk-off environment, buying pressure didn’t quite disappear. Source: TradingView (BTC/USDT) In short, the crypto market today jumped on bid support. Alas, with institutional catalysts still missing, inflows concentrated in BTC, fear at extreme levels, and the Altcoin Season Index slipping, broader capital hasn’t entered yet. This is keeping smart money on the sidelines for now. So, while the crypto market today sparked some hope, it’s too early to call a bottom. The bright side – Bullish signals may be still intact, driving the rebound, with a market top nowhere in sight.

Title: Ondo turns to Figure’s stablecoin with $25M investment to back tokenized fund

The investment broadens Ondo Finance’s onchain Treasury reserves and comes amid a renewed push into crypto-backed lending across fintechs, lenders and exchanges. Ondo Finance bought $25 million worth of YLDS, a yield-bearing stablecoin issued by Figure Technology Solutions, to diversify the assets backing its tokenized US Treasurys fund. The company said Monday that YLDS will be added to a reserves portfolio that already includes tokenized Treasury products from major asset managers, including funds issued by BlackRock, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton and WisdomTree. Designed for institutional investors, the Ondo Short-Term US Government Bond Fund (OUSG) offers onchain exposure to Treasurys with 24/7 redemptions and an estimated annual return of 3.68%. The tokenized fund had about $777 million in total value locked (TVL) as of this writing. Figure runs lending and capital-markets infrastructure on the Provenance blockchain, and has originated more than $19 billion in loans across home-equity lines, mortgage products, and crypto-backed credit. The deal follows Figure’s completion of its Nasdaq IPO earlier this year. According to DefiLlama data, its YLDS stablecoin has a market capitalization of around $100 million. Ondo Finance is a US-based platform founded in 2021 that tokenizes traditional financial assets. In October, the company expanded its tokenized asset lineup to BNB Chain, adding more than 100 tokenized Wall Street stocks and exchange-traded funds onchain. On Wednesday, the platform received regulatory approval from the Liechtenstein Financial Market Authority (FMA) to offer tokenized stocks in Europe. Figure’s stock price was up nearly 4% in early trading on Monday, according to Yahoo Finance data. Related: Ondo Finance to SEC: Hold off on Nasdaq’s tokenized securities plan Crypto-backed lending is gaining traction globally, and the trend has accelerated in 2025 as more lenders revive and expand crypto-collateralized loan products. In July, Block Earner introduced Bitcoin-backed home loans in Australia, offering borrowers cash worth up to half a property’s value, with the crypto collateral safeguarded by Fireblocks. On Tuesday, stablecoin issuer Tether announced an investment in Ledn, a platform that provides Bitcoin-backed consumer loans. In the third quarter, Ledn reported originating over $390 million in BTC-backed loans. Centralized exchanges are also expanding into this space and broadening their offerings beyond Bitcoin (BTC). On Thursday, Coinbase rolled out Ether-backed loans for US customers, letting users borrow up to $1 million in USDC against their Ether (ETH) holdings. Coinbase’s onchain lending markets have handled about $1.28 billion in loan originations since launching earlier this year, according to Dune data.

For more information, please contact: Sequana Medical Investor relationsE: IR@sequanamedical.com T: +44 (0) 797 342 9917 About Sequana Medical Sequana Medical NV is a pioneer in treating fluid overload, a serious and frequent clinical complication in patients with liver disease, heart failure and cancer. This causes major medical issues including increased mortality, repeated hospitalizations, severe pain, difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care, they become ineffective, intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options, resulting in poor clinical outcomes, high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing "diuretic resistant" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload, and are intended to deliver major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients, while reducing costs for healthcare systems. The Company received US FDA approval for the alfapump System for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis in December 2024, following the grant of FDA Breakthrough Device Designation in 2019. In Sequana Medical's POSEIDON study, a landmark study across 18 centers in the US and Canada, the pivotal cohort of 40 patients implanted with the alfapump showed at 6 and 24 months post-implantation the virtual elimination of therapeutic paracentesis and an improvement in quality of life1,2. Sequana Medical is commercializing the alfapump through a specialty commercial team initially targeting US liver transplant centers – 90 of these centers perform more than 90% of US liver transplants annually. In August 2025, CMS announced that it approved the New Technology Add-on Payment for the alfapump when performed in the hospital inpatient setting as of October 1, 2025. Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure published in European Journal of Heart Failure in April 2024 support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE, a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study, have been successfully treated with DSR, resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements3. The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board approved the start of the randomized MOJAVE cohort of up to a further 30 patients, which is dependent on securing additional financing. Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent, Belgium. For further information, please visit www.sequanamedical.com. Important Safety Information: For important safety information regarding the alfapump® system, see https://www.sequanamedical.com/wp-content/uploads/ISI.pdf.

Wall Street funds, including BlackRock , have been cutting MicroStrategy exposure because the original “high-beta Bitcoin proxy” trade has broken down and the risk/reward on MSTR now looks worse than just owning Bitcoin or Bitcoin ETFs directly. A mix of aggressive dilution, leverage, governance concerns, and looming index/mandate issues has turned what was a clean proxy into something closer to a complex, quasi-closed-end Bitcoin fund with rising structural risks.

© 2025 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Arthur Hayes predicts Bitcoin may dip below $80K before the Fed ends QT on Dec 1. Market liquidity shows early signs of improvement. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes says macro liquidity trends are showing early signs of improvement. Hayes believes that this could probably lead to a Bitcoin BTC $89 833 24h volatility: 2.6% Market cap: $1.80 T Vol. 24h: $67.83 B price recovery, while staying confident that liquidity conditions would improve after the US Federal Reserve ends quantitative tightening (QT) on December 1. Crypto industry veteran Arthur Hayes noted that Bitcoin may continue to trade below the $90,000 level in the near term. He also flagged the possibility of one final BTC price move toward the low-$80,000 range. However, he believes the $80,000 level is likely to hold as support. minor improvements in $ liq:– fed qt stops dec 1, this wed will prob be last fall in b/s– us banks increased lending in nov we chop below $90k, maybe one more stab down into low $80k's but i think $80k holds. might start nibbling, but leave the bazooka until the new year — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) November 24, 2025 Despite the pullback, Hayes indicated he is considering small accumulation but plans to delay larger purchases until early next year. Hayes says macro liquidity trends are showing early signs of improvement, while highlighting two key developments. The first is that the U.S. Federal Reserve is scheduled to halt quantitative tightening on December 1. The other big improvement is that U.S. banks increased lending activity in November. Both hint at greater liquidity, which could benefit risk-on assets like BTC and digital assets. In a similar prediction, market research firm Swissblock noted a sharp decline in its “Risk-Off Signal,” indicating that the most intense phase of selling may have passed. The firm added that any remaining weakness is likely to appear as a smaller, secondary wave, potentially signaling seller exhaustion. This ultimately signals a shift towards buying momentum ahead. As per data from CoinShares, digital asset investment products recorded US$1.94 billion in outflows last week, extending the four-week total to US$4.92 billion. This marks the third-largest continuous outflow period since 2018. Bitcoin accounted for the largest share, with US$1.27 billion exiting the asset during the week, amid the BTC price correction. However, the report noted a partial reversal on Friday, when the asset saw US$225 million in inflows. Last week, BlackRock Bitcoin ETF saw record outflows, leading the pack. The early trading hours on Monday, November 24, show that the fund continues to bleed further. BlackRock just deposited another 2,822 $BTC($243.59M) and 36,283 $ETH($101.72M) to #CoinbasePrime.https://t.co/qmuDIrPHc6 pic.twitter.com/cAFKd0xDCY — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) November 24, 2025 Ethereum ETH $3 024 24h volatility: 2.8% Market cap: $365.68 B Vol. 24h: $23.07 B also faced significant pressure, with US$589 million withdrawn. Last week, the altcoin saw outflows representing 7.3% of its total assets under management (AuM). Disclaimer: Coinspeaker is committed to providing unbiased and transparent reporting.

BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE: BLK) and AccessFintech (AFT), a leading data and workflow collaboration network for financial markets, today announced a strategic partnership. 0 24 November 2025 Be the first to comment This content is provided by an external author without editing by Finextra. It expresses the views and opinions of the author. Through Aladdin®, BlackRock’s technology platform that unifies the investment management process, the firms will aim to deliver bilateral connectivity and real-time post-trade collaboration between the global buy-side Aladdin platform community, and the 250+ capital markets and asset servicing institutions already connected to AccessFintech’s Synergy Network. “This partnership is a major milestone in our mission to unlock capital market efficiency at scale,” said Sarah Shenton, CEO of AccessFintech. “We’re proud to deepen our relationship with BlackRock and bring the power of our Synergy Network to Aladdin platform clients. This integration will enable interoperable, secure, and intelligent workflow across the investment lifecycle—delivering tangible benefits to the buy-side and enhancing collaboration for brokers, custodians and agent bank participants.”A New Standard for Post-Trade Collaboration The integration between AccessFintech and the Aladdin platform seeks to enable secure, API-first connectivity between buy-side firms and their sell-side, asset-servicing, and market-infrastructure counterparties. Benefits for Aladdin clients include:• Real-time visibility into trade lifecycle events and collaborate directly with brokers and custodians to resolve exceptions and reduce fails;• Access to real-time, cross-asset, multi-region data and AI-driven predictive analytics without changing existing infrastructure;• Accelerated remediation processes and reduce operational risk across securities, private markets (loans), and derivatives (swaps). Sell-side participants and asset servicers gain a powerful new channel to engage with the global network of buy-side firms on the Aladdin platform, enabling faster resolution and prevention of exceptions and providing transparency for better decision-making to improve client outcomes. “BlackRock has accelerated its strategy in partnership with AccessFintech, integrating real-time data across the post-trade and asset servicing lifecycle. This delivers more efficient workflow, greater interoperability, and improved risk management,” said Michael Debevec, Head of Global Investment Operations at BlackRock. “Our partnership extends these benefits to the wider Aladdin community, helping clients achieve higher operational performance and capacity throughout the investment lifecycle with a broader ecosystem of collaborators, enhancing the client experience.”Strategic Investment to Accelerate InnovationBlackRock has separately made a strategic capital investment in AccessFintech designed to support the company’s next phase of growth, including product innovation, global expansion, and deeper ecosystem integration. The investment reflects a shared commitment to a more connected, data-driven capital markets infrastructure. “BlackRock shares our vision for what advanced technologies can do to transform the post-trade landscape,” added Shenton. “This investment will accelerate our efforts to bring to market the innovations that continue to drive alpha for our clients.”Terms of the investment were not disclosed.

Title: A massive tech update will bring faster, cheaper trading to Wall Street. Get ready for stocks on a blockchain

Time Published: 2025-11-24T15:00:00Z
Full Content:
In early 2021, an army of retail traders made massive bets on meme stocks and briefly melted down the market. Trading volume swelled to such a huge extent that popular brokerage Robinhood had to halt buy orders for stocks like GameStop for a few days in order to escape a liquidity crisis. At the time, the situation led to claims of a conspiracy, but the reason for the meltdown was more mundane: Wall Street’s creaky infrastructure could not settle trades fast enough. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev and others called for an overhaul, and since then there has already been progress, as stock trades now settle a day sooner than in 2021. But the financial industry is also pushing ahead with a more radical solution: turning stocks into digital assets that can be traded and settled instantly on a blockchain. It is not just crypto firms and fintech players leading this charge for “tokenization.” Big banks like J.P. Morgan are also using blockchains to facilitate trades in certain assets and, in doing so, transforming the financial ecosystem more broadly. Already, tokenization—which Tenev has described as a “freight train” poised to eat Wall Street—has brought fundamental changes to how stocks and other assets are traded. The potential upsides to tokenization are huge, but significant questions remain over how to implement it. Meanwhile, some fear the coming train could undermine some protections for individual “retail” investors and destabilize a U.S. equities market whose reliability has for decades been the envy of the world. The tokenization wave isn’t the first push to overhaul Wall Street’s under-the-hood operations. In the 1970s, traders confronted what became known as the “paperwork crisis,” which saw stock markets, drowning in orders, shut down mid-week simply to keep up with recordkeeping. Repeated work stoppages finally led to a computer-based solution. “Once upon a time there were leather-bound journals that said who owns all the stock,” explains Robert Leshner, a former economist who now runs the tokenization firm Superstate. “Then, people said, ‘This is too hard, let’s not update anymore,’ so they decided to create a legal fiction that assigned ownership of all the stock to the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation,” or DTCC. The DTCC regime, which has been in place for decades, means it’s no longer necessary to record every single share transfer. Instead, the clearinghouse keeps track of the stock held by different brokerages on behalf of their customers and settles up transactions between those brokerages the next business day. Under this system, the brokerages nominally own the stock, but all the rights that attach to it—dividends, voting privileges, and so on—remain with the customers. The system has worked pretty well over the decades, and for those who insist on doing things the old-fashioned way, DTCC means they can still demand physical copies of their shares. (This option is popular with “GameStop truthers,” who believe reverting to paper will thwart a Wall Street conspiracy against retail investors.) Now, though, the current DTCC system of “T+1”—in which the clearinghouse closes out trades the next business day by reconciling accounts among brokerages—has come to feel outdated in an age when so much business is conducted instantly and around the clock. This has prompted companies like Leshner’s Superstate to offer a faster alternative. The startup is working with companies to issue versions of their shares that trade on a blockchain, an arrangement under which the firms don’t have to rely on intermediaries to hold or track their stock. It also means stock trades can be settled instantly, while allowing firms to interact with their shareholders more directly. Outside the U.S., tokenized assets are already helping investors avoid big trading commissions and invest in private companies like SpaceX Other firms are approaching tokenization in a different fashion. Robinhood, for example, doesn’t help firms tokenize their stocks, but instead takes stocks available on the open market and offers them in a blockchain “wrapper” as a sort of derivative. These offerings are currently available only in Europe, where stock owners can buy and sell the “Stock Tokens” alongside assets like Bitcoin. Retail investors unfamiliar with tokenization may be surprised, and possibly alarmed, to discover that a company they own is trading in the crypto-verse. For now, at least, it’s not something to worry about.Currently, even tokenization boosters say the new blockchain system will exist alongside the old one rather than replace it. So why do all this in the first place? For the average investor who trades only from time to time, the arrival of tokenized assets won’t mean much. Active traders, though, will appreciate the move to blockchain, since it opens the door for more trading after hours and on weekends. The new regime will also be appealing to institutional investors, since it will free up collateral that might otherwise be tied up waiting for settlement. “Imagine you’re a hedge fund and want to buy $1 million of Tesla stock,” says Johann Kerbrat, SVP of Robinhood Crypto. “You buy it on Friday, so you don’t have the money anymore, but you don’t get the shares in your account until Monday. So for three days, you can’t do anything.” It’s not just stocks being tokenized. BlackRock’s BUIDL fund, working with Superstate’s tokenization rival Securitize, offers access to money-market funds and U.S. Treasuries via blockchain, and has already grown to $2 billion in assets under management. Meanwhile,J.P. Morgan is offering tokenized versions of private equity assets on its in-house Kinexys blockchain, in part because the process makes capital calls easier to track and manage. This is likely just the beginning. Rob Hadick, a partner at venture capital firm Dragonfly Capital, notes that other realms of finance like credit and fixed income are still conducted primarily in pre-digital fashion, with some transactions still made official by means of a fax. A switch to tokenization could enable such transactions to settle faster and more reliably. Hadick says it will also produce savings for banks and brokerages since it will reduce the ranks of back-office staff and disrupt specialized middlemen who handle tasks like loan origination and servicing fees. Meanwhile, for traders of all sorts, tokenized assets will be easier to move across brokerages or post as collateral. It is still early days, especially in the U.S., where the Securities and Exchange Commission has yet to give the green light to tokenized equities. As of mid-November, the total value of such assets worldwide was about $660 million, according to research site RWA.xyz; the most popular ones include tokenized versions of index-tracking ETFs and Big Tech stocks such as Tesla, Nvidia, and Alphabet. But that nascent state hasn’t stopped brokerages from pushing forward, including crypto shop Kraken, whose tokenized versions of select U.S. stocks are doing a brisk trade in markets like Brazil and South Africa, where traders still pay hefty commissions that can amount to 10% or more, even as such fees have largely been eliminated in the U.S. Robinhood, meanwhile, got its hands on shares of privately held OpenAI and SpaceX, and has given away tokenized versions of them to European customers. As for the DTCC, it would be easy to assume the clearinghouse opposes the tokenization wave. Quite the opposite: According to two sources familiar with the company, the outfit is eager to move into blockchain, partly because it offers a potential way to expand into private markets. Asked for comment, the DTCC did not provide details but did suggest it is embracing the technology. “DTCC believes in the power and potential of tokenization to evolve and modernize market infrastructure. We are actively working to enable capabilities that further our products and services,” said Brian Steele, DTCC’s president of clearing and securities services. Not everyone is convinced a rush to tokenization is a good thing. Those urging caution include Citadel Securities, which has asked the SEC to adopt a go-slow approach. According to a source close to the firm, the trading giant fears that some crypto-aligned firms want to use the rulemaking process around tokenization to gain exemptions from long-standing consumer protection obligations. The person also expressed concern that a rapid shift could undermine trust in a U.S. equities market that is the biggest in the world and has been fine-tuned for decades. This concern may not be unfounded. Already, there have been notable discrepancies between the prices of traditional shares of a company’s stock and the prices of tokenized versions offered by the likes of Kraken. Meanwhile, it’s unclear if every firm offering tokenized equities has put in place adequate guardrails when it comes to custody and fiduciary obligations to the customer. What happens, for instance, in the event of a crypto firm going bankrupt while holding tokenized shares of a customer’s stock? And while every financial institution appears to view blockchain as the technology of the future, they may not agree as to which blockchain. Robinhood, among others, is relying on the open-source Ethereum chain to build out its tokenization business, while J.P. Morgan appears wedded to its own proprietary chain. According to Hadick, the venture capitalist, this situation could slow adoption, since, he says, other big firms like Goldman Sachs will be reluctant to rely on a blockchain controlled by a rival. Hadick adds, though, that any impasse is unlikely to last long, since “one thing blockchains do well is coordinate trust.” This article appears in the December 2025/January 2026 issue of Fortune with the headline: “Get ready to own a tokenized portfolio.” This article is part of Fortune’s 2025 Investor’s Guide.

MAGA Liz Wolfe | 11.24.2025 9:30 AM Trumpworld schism: On Friday night, MAGA Queen Marjorie Taylor Greene announced her resignation from Congress. "I've always represented the common American man and woman as a member of the House of Representatives, which is why I've always been despised in Washington, D.C. and just never fit in. Americans are used by the political industrial complex of both political parties, election cycle after election cycle, in order to elect whichever side can convince Americans to hate the other side more," the Georgia Republican said in her resignation video: My message to Georgia's 14th district and America.Thank you. pic.twitter.com/tSoHCeAjn1 — Marjorie Taylor Greene ???????? (@mtgreenee) November 22, 2025 Greene struck predictably populist America First notes ("Americans' hard-earned tax dollars always fund foreign wars, foreign aid, and foreign interests") and mapped her disagreements with the president ("H1Bs replacing American jobs, AI state moratoriums, debt for life 50 year mortgage scams, standing strongly against all involvement in foreign wars, and demanding the release of the Epstein files") while touting her loyalty. Read her full statement here. The Reason Roundup Newsletter by Liz Wolfe Liz and Reason help you make sense of the day's news every morning. Until recently, Greene and President Donald Trump seemed to be thick as thieves. But the Epstein files tore them asunder, with Greene positioning herself as an ardent advocate for full transparency while Trump (until recently) refused to go along. The president, pissed off by Greene's adamance, disavowed her and started publicly musing about how someone should mount a primary challenge, calling his once-loyal acolyte a "ranting lunatic." The Epstein issue wedged the door open for Greene to raise more grievances with Trump, especially the idea that he's been getting distracted from his domestic agenda and hasn't delivered much financial relief to the American people. The conflict came to a head during the recent government shutdown. "I don't see political party lines," said Greene, discussing health care and the many Americans who could soon see premiums spiking. Greene criticized her own side for having no workable plan in place to prevent these higher costs. "I don't know what happened to Marjorie," said Trump recently. "Nice woman, but I don't know what happened. She's lost her way, I think." Many of her constituents are still behind her. "I feel like she has stood her ground," Meredith Rosson, a 43-year-old paralegal and the chairwoman of the Republican Party in Chattooga County, told The New York Times. The Republican Party in Floyd County, also in Greene's district, issued a statement of "unwavering support" for Greene as soon as she announced her resignation. "She's realized, 'I need to do what's right for my community and for people who are mostly in the middle ground,'" cocktail bar/gun store owner Brandon Pledger told the Times. Scenes from New York: "Violent crime is overwhelmingly the work of a small group of repeat offenders—that is, it is highly concentrated. The remedy, as [James Q.] Wilson argued half a century ago in his classic book Thinking About Crime, is not social engineering but incapacitation: keeping the violent few from striking again," argues Tal Fortgang in City Journal. "In 2022, the New York Times reported that 'nearly a third of all shoplifting arrests in New York City…involved just 327 people,' or 0.004 percent of the population, who had been 'arrested and rearrested more than 6,000 times.'"

Landlords in Foxrock, Co Dublin, are commanding the highest average rents in the State at almost €4,000 a month, latest data from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) shows. Renting a home in the south Dublin neighbourhood in the first quarter of this year would set a household back an average of €3,718 a month, said the CSO. Areas in south Dublin had the top 10 highest rents at the start of the year, with Goatstown in second place (€3,104 per month), followed by Dalkey, Killiney, Glenageary, Sandymount, Booterstown, Blackrock, Ballsbridge and Donnybrook, where average rents were €2,547. Outside Dublin the highest rents were in Greystones and Delgany, both in Co Wicklow (€2,331 and €2,077 per month), Bishopstown, Co Cork (€2,043) and Barna, Co Galway (€1,961). Across local authority housing, there was a 6 per cent increase in rents on average over the 12 months to September 2025. The rental figures, drawn from Residential Tenancies Board statistics, are among a wealth of information collated on the CSO’s housing information hub, including property prices, housing commencements and completions, planning permissions and vacant dwellings numbers. Property prices continued to increase this year compared with last, though by almost twice as much outside Dublin (9.4 per cent) as in the capital (5.3 per cent). On new homes, the number of dwellings granted planning permission was down 13 per cent – from 8,513 units in the third quarter of last year to 7,447 in 2025. However, the number of dwelling completions was up 13 per cent in the first three quarters of the year, standing at 24,325, compared with the same period in 2024. There were 177,600 people working in the construction industry. Among these, 67 per cent mainly worked on new housing developments or renovations. Average hourly labour costs for the sector were €34.22 in third quarter of this year, up from €30.85 in the second quarter of last year. Data shows that home heating fuels of choice are changing. As of the third quarter this year the most common main heating fuel across all dwellings was gas (35 per cent), followed by heating oil and electricity. For homes built since 2015 however, the most common heating fuel was electricity. Homes constructed from 2020 to the third quarter of this year were 93 per cent electrically heated, with 6 per cent using gas and less than 1 per cent using oil. Statistics on building energy ratings (BERs) show Kildare had the highest proportion of A-rated homes (28 per cent), followed by Meath (27 per cent) and Dublin county (27 per cent), while the lowest were in Leitrim and Cork city (both 5 per cent). The highest proportions of G-rated dwellings were in counties Roscommon and Leitrim (11 per cent). [ ‘I don’t think Balbriggan was ready for this amount of people’: The challenges facing a Dublin commuter townOpens in new window ] In the Dublin postal districts, the highest proportions of A-rated homes were in Dublin 18 which includes Foxrock, Sandyford and Stepaside (43 per cent), Dublin 13 including Sutton and Howth (31 per cent), and Dublin 20 including Chapelizod and Palmerstown (28 per cent). The lowest level of A ratings in the capital was 7 per cent in Dublin 7, which includes Cabra, Phibsborough and Smithfield. In the last three months of 2023, the estimated national vacancy rate was 3.3 per cent based on low to zero electricity consumption in a dwelling. The local authorities with the highest vacancy rates this period were Leitrim (8.5 per cent), Roscommon (6.5 per cent) and Mayo (6.4 per cent).

Title: Crypto is getting punched in the face again—but this is no 2022

Jeff John Roberts is the Finance and Crypto editor at Fortune, overseeing coverage of the blockchain and how technology is changing finance. It’s getting ugly out there. On Friday, Bitcoin’s latest swoon saw it fall to $82,000, marking a drop of around 32% from its all-time high of $126,000. That high came just last month, but it now feels like a distant memory as exchanges liquidate over-leveraged traders, and retail buyers curse the day a cousin gave them that tip about Bonk coin. So just how much lower will prices drop? There’s a good chance that $82,000 is not the bottom. While prices have rallied in the last few days, with Bitcoin trading around $86,000 on Monday morning, it’s easy to envision scenarios where it drops to $70,000 or lower. A jolt of dour macro-economic news or a major scandal (more on that in a second), and we could be right back in Crypto Winter. As for how we got here, it’s pretty clear that Oct. 10 was the catalyst for the current malaise. That was the day that saw around $19 billion of forced liquidations—underscoring the perils that go with allowing crypto cowboys to leverage their positions by as much as 100x. That wipeout, in turn, spooked the many institutional investors that rushed into the sector amid the euphoria that came with President Donald Trump’s favorable regulatory policies. It turned out that it was just as easy for them to rush out again. The crypto industry’s painful financial month, one of its worst on record, is also bad for its already-tarnished reputation. Longtime haters will be keen to jump in with the familiar narrative that crypto is little more than a nest of fools and swindlers, and that it’s the Sam Bankman-Fried era all over again. That view, however, is mistaken. The crypto collapse of 2022, which saw Bitcoin fall as low as $16,000, was indeed touched off by a wave of fraud. The villains included not only Bankman-Fried, but figures like stablecoin scammer Do Kwon and Alex Mashinsky, who ran a “trusted” centralized platform for crypto deposits. Conversely, there is no major scandal driving crypto’s current woes—though we could, of course, see some nasty stuff get exposed if prices keep falling. All of this, though, can make it easy to overlook just how much bigger the crypto industry is today, and how much its underlying infrastructure has matured. Sure, some institutional investors have gotten cold feet about buying tokens, but there are a lot of very big names—think BlackRock and now Citadel Securities—which have made clear they are in for the long haul. The fact of the matter is that blockchain technology is simply superior to the legacy software that most of the financial system relies on, and Wall Street is ready for an upgrade. This process is just beginning, and it will ensure ongoing adoption of marquee crypto projects like Ethereum and Solana. It also won’t be long until DeFi systems become interwoven with the broader financial system. As my lawyer pal Marvin Ammori noted, the daily trading volume on the DeFi exchange Uniswap is equal to a month of trading volume on Kalshi, which is being treated as the hottest thing in town. The bottom line here is that crypto is taking its lumps right now, but things are not as bad as they seem. The downturn will serve to wash some of the worst grifters out of the industry, and force those left to step up and prove they are building something of value. This will happen but it could be a while before we see Bitcoin at $126,000 again. Jeff John Roberts jeff.roberts@fortune.com@jeffjohnroberts Another TradFi convert: Citadel Securities, the market making giant owned by mega-billionaire Ken Griffin, is investing $200 million into Kraken. The deal suggests Citadel, which had previously avoided crypto, sees a future in tokenization. (Fortune) SPACs smacked: A bid by Pomp to take his DAT public through a reverse merger got rebuffed when the partner vehicle called off the deal on the grounds it was bad for shareholders. Other would-be crypto SPACs are also facing skepticism—a far cry from 2021 when the gimmick was widely used to enrich insiders at the expense of retail investors. (Bloomberg) Jamie debanks Jack: Strike CEO Jack Mallers complained on Twitter that JPMorgan Chase terminated his accounts over unspecified “concerning activity,” leading crypto figures Bo Hines to complain that the outspoken Bitcoin maxi had been debanked. (Decrypt) Dirty money bonanza: A major global news investigation found at least $28 billion worth of criminal funds from pig butchers, North Korean hackers and others have flowed into Binance, OKX and other exchanges in the last two years, in part from ask-no-question storefronts. (New York Times) DePIN drone network: The sector known as decentralized physical infrastructure has been in the dog house since the Helium debacle. Now a drone-tracking startup wants to build out its network by selling $949 sensors and paying out a new type of token for contributing to its network. Sure, but why not just use stablecoins instead? (Fortune) Former JPM exec and noted ‘permabull’ Tom Lee takes the main character crown this week for his bullish or perhaps delusional assurances that everything is great, even as his leading Ethereum DAT is badly underwater. Points for staying on message, Tom. The timeline is suddenly full of McDonald’s memes—a mainstay of bear markets as crypto bros joke about being so ruined they have to sling fries. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Saudi Aramco Weighs Raising Billions Of Dollars From Its Biggest Disposals Yet

Saudi Aramco is considering plans to raise billions of dollars by selling a range of assets, people familiar with the matter said, deals that could rank as its most significant disposals ever. The firm is weighing the sale of a stake in its oil export and storage terminals as part of the plans, the people said, declining to be identified as the information is confidential. Banks have been asked to pitch for roles on feasibility studies for the disposals, which could fetch more than $10 billion, they said. Aramco is eying options including raising fresh equity from the deal, the people said. It could also pursue a structure similar to the recent $11 billion lease transaction with a group led by BlackRock Inc.’s Global Infrastructure Partners for assets linked to the Jafurah gas project, they said. That sale drew interest from firms around the world and bankers have since pitched several asset disposal plans given increasing demand from investors, one of the people said. Aramco’s terminals business is seen as a lucrative asset and the company could kick off a formal sales process as soon as early next year, the person said. At the same time, the oil giant is considering selling part of its real estate portfolio, some of the people said. Those assets will also likely be worth billions of dollars and will be seen as attractive at a time when the kingdom is advancing plans to allow foreign ownership. Discussions are at an early stage and no final decisions have been made. Representatives for Aramco didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Aramco’s main oil storage and export infrastructure is located at Ras Tanura on the Persian Gulf and the company has similar terminals on the Red Sea. Internationally, the firm owns stakes in product terminals in the Netherlands and leases crude as well as product storage at main trade hubs in Egypt and at Okinawa in Japan. Oil prices have dropped by roughly a fifth this year and while that decline has somewhat been tempered by higher output, Aramco has delayed some projects and looked to sell assets to free up cash for investments. The deals now being considered would mark a step up from previous transactions that were focused on stakes in pipeline infrastructure. The world’s biggest oil exporter is a lynchpin of the Saudi economy. Revenue from energy sales and the firm’s hefty dividend payouts help support the kingdom’s expensive economic revamp, some elements of which have been hamstrung by growing costs. Meanwhile, Aramco is continuing to invest in big-ticket projects like Jafurah, which is set to start production this year and reach full capacity in 2030.

Title: 6 Affordable ETFS for Dividend Aristocrats

Company dividends are a crucial part of a stock’s total return. These ETFs track firms with strong records of quarterly payouts. The Daily Upside Staff squad@thedailyupside.com The old proverb that warns against judging a book by its cover dates at least to ancient Rome, and it applies to subjects far beyond its literal meaning, including investments. It’s easy for retail investors to grow mesmerized by the surface-level performance of hourly, daily or even annual, ups and downs of the market. While those shifts tell more than the cover story, it’s still only part of the story, and dividends can be another critical indicator of, and contributor to, value. Over the past century, payments comprising a portion of cash proceeds from operations have made up 31% of the S&P 500’s total return on a pro-forma basis, according to S&P Global Research. (The statistic includes hypothetical returns for some periods, since the index itself wasn’t created until 1957.) During some decades, such as the 1940s and 1970s, dividends have made up more than half of returns, and thanks to the miracles of compounding, they can drive investors’ gains exponentially higher. Compound for Pound Including dividends, the S&P 500’s return from January 1930 to February 2025 would have been 9,584 points, compared with just 278 points excluding the payouts, according to the data. Investors seeking to take advantage of such multiples don’t have to find high-dividend stocks on their own: A number of exchange-traded funds offer simplified access. They’re not all created equal, however. The following list highlights six funds that pair attractive price-to-earning ratios with holdings known for dividend quality, ranked from lowest to highest. While there’s only one ETF on the market that focuses solely on dividend aristocrats, companies that have raised dividends for 25 consecutive years or more, each of the funds offers access to firms with a strong payout record: Digital asset treasury companies are grappling with the law of diminishing returns in the midst of a cryptocurrency swoon. What’s next? Despite concerns ahead of the busiest season for retailers, projections show Americans are ready to open their wallets. Nvidia faced “the tough task of meeting high earnings expectations and high skepticism around AI capex,” per analysts at Bank of America. Bitcoin has so far fallen 20% from its 2025 peak this cycle; in previous bear markets, it fell as much as 30% to 40%. The cult hero/curiosity has launched a social media broadside against the AI trade that has fueled this year’s market rally. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon and Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick warned of an equities drawdown on Tuesday at a summit in Hong Kong. Metsera on Tuesday called Novo Nordisk’s new $10 billion offer “superior” to rival Pfizer’s bid of $8 billion. The company has been one of the top beneficiaries of Trump administration policies, with US revenue climbing 68% year-over-year in Q2. Still in the “early innings of its growth story,” Robinhood has morphed from an app with crowdsourced stock advice to a financial ecosystem. Life is notoriously tough for those on the bottom rung of the Wall Street ladder, where weeks can stretch up to 100 hours. Disclosures by two regional lenders last week set off a mini-panic about bad loans on the books of small and medium cap banks. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: Crypto treasuries facing $130 billion value reckoning as ETFs reshape market

EFT impact and "crypto-per-share" focus redefine corporate treasury strategies in the crypto market. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Investors long paid premiums for Digital Asset Treasury firms, seeing them as practical substitutes for holding Bitcoin when direct access was limited. That approach worked when regulated channels were scarce and corporate balance sheets offered the closest approximation to holding the asset itself. But according to Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise Asset Management, the conditions that once supported those valuations have fundamentally changed. In a valuation framework released on Nov. 23, Hougan argued that the $130 billion sector now faces a structural shift. While the forces pushing DATs below the value of their crypto holdings, illiquidity, operating costs, and execution risk, are constant across the model, the factors that can lift valuations above parity are limited and uncertain. The natural state of a passive treasury, he wrote, is a discount. Hougan’s analysis challenges the assumptions that fueled the rise of companies such as Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) and Metaplanet Inc., which built investment cases around holding large quantities of Bitcoin. His model treats spot-value parity as the starting point and subtracts three predictable valuation drags. The first is illiquidity. Bitcoin held inside a corporation cannot be redeemed directly by shareholders, and the friction between ownership and access typically results in a discount. Hougan described this gap as the price investors assign to delayed or constrained delivery of the underlying asset. The second is operating expense. Public companies incur recurring costs, including compensation, audits, custody arrangements, and legal services. Those expenses reduce net asset value on a continuous basis, meaning a dollar of Bitcoin held by a corporation is inherently worth less than a dollar held directly. The third is execution risk. Investors must account for the possibility that management will misallocate capital, misjudge markets, or face regulatory setbacks. Because the probability is non-zero, markets generally factor this risk into pricing. Hougan wrote: “Most of the reasons they should trade at a discount are certain and most of the reasons they might trade at a premium are uncertain…Expenses and risk compound over time.” Taken together, these factors form the baseline markdown that applies to most DAT structures before any upside levers are considered. The downward pressure on DAT valuations has intensified with the expansion of spot Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded funds. Before ETF approvals, corporate treasuries served as the primary entry point for institutions and retail investors seeking regulated exposure without the custody complexity. That scarcity allowed some DAT stocks to trade well above their underlying holdings. The introduction of spot ETFs removed that structural advantage. BlackRock Inc., Fidelity Investments, and other issuers now offer low-fee products that track Bitcoin and ETH directly, with intraday liquidity and daily creations and redemptions. Nate Geraci, the president of NovaDius Wealth, called spot ETFs “DAT killers,” arguing that they closed the regulatory arbitrage that once justified premium pricing. Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst Eric Balchunas added that ETFs perform the same function as DATs “with good tracking,” providing cleaner exposure while avoiding the overhead of a corporate structure. He acknowledged that some institutions can hold only equities or bonds, which gives companies like MicroStrategy residual appeal. Still, he noted that this group is “not enough for a bunch of them to thrive.” With the premium model eroding, Hougan argues that a DAT’s valuation now depends on its ability to increase crypto per share. Only four strategies reliably support that objective: issuing debt to buy more crypto, lending assets for yield, using options strategies, and acquiring assets at a discount. Issuing debt is historically the most powerful tool, particularly when credit markets are favorable and Bitcoin is appreciating. If the asset consistently outperforms the interest burden, shareholders can achieve accretive gains. But the strategy relies on timing, balance-sheet strength, and access to capital markets. Lending, structured products, and options generate incremental returns but introduce counterparty or strategy risk. Mergers and acquisitions can increase scale, lowering financing costs and expanding the set of transactions a DAT can pursue. Hougan said “scale matters” because larger firms can access cheaper capital and better deal flow. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley expects these pressures to accelerate consolidation. “We’re in the early innings of what DATs will become,” he said, predicting that surviving firms will evolve into operating companies that buy private crypto businesses and generate revenue rather than relying solely on treasury appreciation. Considering this, Hougan concluded: “Going forward, I think there will be more differentiation. A few will execute well and trade at a premium, and many will execute poorly and trade at a discount. This model is one way to think about which is which.” The move toward more disciplined valuation coincides with losses across Bitcoin treasury stocks. Research from 10X Research estimates that retail investors lost about $17 billion in recent months as markets repriced corporate holdings. The firm attributed these losses to the collapse of what it described as “financial alchemy,” where share issuance created the appearance of expanding upside until volatility erased the effect. Data from CryptoRank indicates sector-wide dispersion. Treasuries with high operating costs, limited scale, or large sell-side overhangs have underperformed, while firms focused on crypto-per-share expansion have been more resilient. Taken together, these shifts suggest that DATs must now compete directly with ETFs on cost, liquidity, and transparency. The period in which corporate balance sheets commanded automatic premiums is no longer supported by market structure. For the largest players, the challenge is proving they operate businesses rather than functioning as static balance-sheet vehicles. Firms that cannot offset expense drag or grow crypto-per-share are likely to trade at structural discounts, while those adopting active strategies may retain a valuation advantage. As ETFs capture a larger share of institutional flows, the market is sending a clear signal: simply holding Bitcoin is no longer enough. A DAT must demonstrate it can generate value beyond its treasury, or its equity will reflect the underlying arithmetic. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change Quote of the Week: “Science cannot solve the ultimate mystery of nature” — Max Planck Number of the Week: ~4.5 mm/year v. 1-2 mm/year THIS WEEK: By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP) Scope: This TWTW begins with an essay by SEPP director David Legates rebutting a claim that today’s complex global climate models accurately forecast climate. TWTW discusses a version of uncertainty proposed by John Ridgway. TWTW discusses Ross McKitrick’s paper of a statistically acceptable way of climate fingerprinting. Then, TWTW discusses an essay and a speech by two commentators on UK energy policy. TWTW closes with an effort by the UNFCCC to impose censorship. ********************* General Patterns v. Specific Details: NOAA research scientist Nadir Jeevanjee claims that today’s complex global climate models accurately forecast climate. As evidence, he offers five forecasts for which the early simple models in a lab of the U.S. Weather Bureau were accurate. The laboratory became the NOAA-financed Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory at Princeton. Jeevanjee claims that the report by five independent scientists (John Christy, Ph.D., Judith Curry, Ph.D., Steven Koonin, Ph.D., Ross McKitrick, Ph.D., Roy Spencer, Ph.D.) published by the Department of Energy in July 2025 claimed that the complexity of current global climate models as the primary reason why the models cannot be trusted. Jeevanjee gave five major examples why current models can be trusted. Writing for the Cornwall Alliance, climatologist David Legates rebutted each example. As posted in WUWT, Legates states [the graph is not shown here but is in the text, boldface added]: Okay, let’s revisit history—because those who can’t remember history correctly are destined to get it wrong. First, we need to get one fact correct. The recent Department of Energy report did not simply cite the complexity of climate models as the primary reason they cannot be trusted. It goes into detail as to why current climate models cannot be trusted: namely, they cannot reproduce current conditions. For example, models are not capable of determining the equilibrium climate sensitivity to increasing carbon dioxide concentrations. As shown in this graph from the DOE report, they tend to ‘run hot,’ or overstate surface warming. [graph not shown here] They also overstate warming of the tropical troposphere, and their simulation of stratospheric cooling is inconsistent. With regards to the tropical troposphere, the excessive warming was noted as a problem in the first United States National Climate Assessment and has been noted in every Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report since. This problem has become more extreme over time—i.e., simulations from later models, despite decades of ‘improvements’ costing billions of dollars, deviate farther from observations than earlier models—and its spatial extent now encompasses the entire globe. But the article asserts that early climate model forecasts about global warming were correct decades before the forecasts could be evaluated. It concludes, ‘it is this track record of success that gives us confidence in interpreting the changes we’re seeing now, as well as predicting changes to come.’ It then lists five forecasts the early models made that underscore how well even those early models could reproduce Earth’s climate. Now, let’s give credit where credit is due, but let’s not reward models for getting the basics of climate correct. In other words, models should not be praised for figuring out that the Poles are cold and the Equator is warm. They should not be given credit for simulating the Hadley Cell circulation or demonstrating that oceans have a moderating effect on climate, for examples. These basic premises of climate are obvious and must have been a product of the simulation; otherwise, the models would have been discarded before they were even published. So, let’s test the article’s evaluation of the models. Forecast number 1: early models correctly simulated surface global warming from increased carbon dioxide. Yes, but this was obvious long before the first models were created. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, and thus the more of it added to the atmosphere, the higher surface temperature should rise. Way back in 1896, Svante Arrhenius (1859–1927) showed that an increase in carbon dioxide would increase global temperatures. The question always has been, and still is, how much should the temperature rise from, say, a doubling of carbon dioxide? Early models argued that the temperature rise would be between 2.0 and 3.5 degrees Celsius. These numbers are actually closer to reality than estimates provided by later model simulations, but they are still higher than data-driven estimates using historical and paleoclimate data. Verdict? Early models would have been discarded if they had simulated cooling or had no effect. That they simulated warming from increased greenhouse gases is no proof of their reliability. Forecast number 2: the models predicted stratospheric cooling from adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. This should also have been relatively obvious. If outgoing terrestrial radiation is being intercepted by more carbon dioxide at the surface, and some of it is radiated back to the surface, then less will reach the stratosphere and, consequently, the stratosphere should cool. Again, the question that demands an answer is, ‘How much cooling?’—and even current climate models cannot simulate this correctly or consistently. Forecast number 3: Arctic amplification. The Conversation suggests that it was surprising that the early models accurately predicted that rising carbon dioxide concentrations would warm the Arctic more than the Tropics. But that was no surprise at all. Given a warming planet, the Arctic will warm faster than the Equator due to six factors. Therefore, a greater warming of the Arctic was obvious to climatologists even before the first climate model was created. That models simulate it is no big feat. Forecast number 4: land-ocean contrast. The article notes that the coupled atmosphere-ocean model ‘led to a slew of insights, including the observation that land generally warms more than ocean, by a factor of about 1.5.’ While this may sound impressive to the uninitiated, climatologists have long known the moderating effect of the oceans, again due to their high specific heat. Consider San Diego and Dallas, at about the same latitude of 33 degrees north. The annual temperature range in San Diego is about 8 degrees Celsius, while that in Dallas is about 22 degrees—a factor of almost three. Extending any transect to both coasts indicates that the annual temperature range—and the diurnal temperature range, for that matter—increases with distance from the coast. To anyone who understands the Earth’s climate, the central Plains have a much greater temperature range than either coast, for example. So, why would this have been a novel finding back in 1979? Any competent climatologist would have known this, so it must have been a basic component of any climate model worth its salt at the time. Forecast number 5: delayed warming of the Southern Ocean around Antarctica. This issue arises from the supposedly novel fact that the Arctic has a greater warming signal than that of the Southern Ocean. But why is that surprising? The change in albedo is not as great in Antarctica, since there is little land area exposed by melting snow and ice, while there is much in the Arctic. Sea ice dynamics differ considerably in the Southern Hemisphere, and the loss of sea ice isn’t as dramatic to warming Antarctica. Moreover, the Southern Ocean is bounded by a hemisphere of ocean, which has a moderating effect on the climate as mentioned earlier. Thus, important contributions to Arctic warming are not present in the Southern Ocean, and so we would have expected the Southern Ocean to be different from the Arctic. The take-home message? If early climate models missed any of these supposed climate novelties, climate modeling wouldn’t have gotten off the ground. What early climate modeling showed was that the basics of climate could be replicated with simple mathematical approximations. But that’s the basics. The details are that climate is still very complex, and while the general patterns can be simulated accurately, specific details as to how climate varies spatially and how it is likely to change under various scenarios are still a far-off challenge. The article concludes: ‘Climate models have their limitations, of course. For instance, they cannot predict regional climate change as well as people would like. But the fact that climate science, like any field, has significant unknowns should not blind us to what we do know.’ I agree, but I would also note that we were not blind to these facts before the advent of climate models. Syukuro Manabe deserves credit for demonstrating that the basics of climate can be reproduced with a rudimentary computer program run on early computers. But the fact remains that current model simulations still deviate significantly from real-world observations. And let’s not lose sight of the fact that early climatologists understood quite a bit about how the Earth’s climate works. Yes, there were climatologists before the climate modelers, and they knew an awful lot about the Earth’s climate. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy. ********************* Uncertainty: As David Legates writes above, the global climate models are highly inconsistent and generally greatly overestimate the warming of the atmosphere. Modelers often dismiss criticism of the inconsistency and the overestimate as the result of “initial conditions.” If the initial conditions are accurate, part of the inconsistency in modeling results can be attributed to initial conditions, but the overestimates may be from the use of the wrong data to detect the greenhouse effect. In two essays posted on Judith Curry’s Climate Etc. and one in Climate Scepticism (English spelling) John Ridgway addresses the issues of uncertainty. In the second essay posted in Climate Etc. “Natural Selection of Bad Science. Part II,” Ridgway discusses “Distinguishing Two Dimensions of Uncertainty” by Craig Fox and Gülden Ülkümen. The issues arise from the fact that modeling is not measurement and the efforts to attach probability estimates on a range of modeling results are without any foundation in classical probability and statistics. For example, if modelers state the results are a of range of 1.5 – 4.5°C, they don’t have a sound statistical basis for attaching probabilities to these estimates. In a long post on Curry’s website, Ridgway address this issue and efforts to minimize it. He states: “…the problem didn’t go away, and we now live in a world where it is common practice for climate scientists to confuse epistemic and aleatory uncertainty by trying to treat the spread of model outputs as if dealing with a measurement problem that can be characterized using probability distributions. It’s possible that some climate scientists are simply unaware of the issue, but many others deliberately ignore it because they recognize the expedience of pretending that the epistemic uncertainties involved can be analyzed as if they were aleatory.” [Boldface added.] Here Ridgway introduces terms that may be from philosophy: “epistemic uncertainties” and “aleatory uncertainties.” Epistemic uncertainty arises for a lack of knowledge (incomplete understanding in a model) and possibly could be resolved by gathering more data or better data. Aleatoric uncertainty arises because of the unpredictable, random nature of the physical system (randomness and noise). This uncertainty cannot be resolved by more and better data. The distinction is useful because it may be helpful to address issues that arise when global climate modelers dismiss criticisms of the inconsistency of their work as resulting from “initial conditions.” For example, turbulence is a vexing problem in fluid dynamics that no one has solved. Turbulence can be considered an aleatory uncertainty, it is random. In climate modeling, turbulence will produce different results with different initial conditions. However, the use of surface-air temperature data for modeling is not an aleatory uncertainty. It is the wrong data to use if one is forecasting the influence of greenhouse gases that exist in the atmosphere. Further, surface-air data is subject to many other human influences that have no relationship with greenhouse gases, such as the urban heat island effect, roadways, runways, landscape changes, etc. The variation between surface-air temperature trends and atmospheric temperature trends cannot be dismissed as aleatory uncertainty, random. The differences are epistemic, lacking appropriate knowledge. Yet the appropriate knowledge exists but is ignored by the global climate modeling community. There is no justification for saying the difference is the result of initial conditions. Under Problem number 1: The converted meteorologist in “More on the Uncertainty Monster” Ridgway writes: “’Internal variability, part of the natural variability of the climate system, can be estimated from high-resolution simulators, but it is only a tiny part of total uncertainty. Over centurial scales, it is negligible compared to our combined uncertainty of the behavior of the icesheets, and the marine and terrestrial biosphere.’ As a consequence, the road to improved forecasting is markedly different for the two challenges. For meteorology, improvement is traditionally gained by using simulations of greater fidelity and granularity, powered by extra computer and physical perturbation ensembles of increasing size. For climate science, the solution lies more in gaining a greater understanding of the complexities and feedbacks involved and how they operate in the long term. The distinction is essentially that which exists between variability and incertitude, and hence between the aleatory and epistemic approaches. However, there is always a danger that an individual steeped in the traditions of the former may not be able to fully adjust when engaged in the latter. If Monte Carlo simulations and similar stochastic sampling techniques have proved immensely effective within their realm, the temptation might be to believe that the realm of the epistemic could be similarly tamed. One individual who may fit this description is Professor Tim Palmer, an academic who has done as much as anyone in pioneering and finessing the techniques that underpin modern-day weather forecasting. In his book, The Primacy of Doubt, these successes are described in chapters such as ‘Chaos, Chaos Everywhere,’ ‘The Geometry of Chaos,’ ‘Noisy, Million-Dollar Butterflies’ and ‘The Two Roads to Monte Carlo.’ However, in the chapter ‘Climate Change,’ he states the following when discussing climate change multi-model ensembles: ‘This provides a natural ‘ensemble of opportunity’ to study climate change. It is an example of the so-called multi-model ensemble mentioned in Chapter 5. Each model differs from the others in the precise computational techniques used to solve the Navier-Stokes equation, and, more importantly, in the parameterization formulae for unresolved processes.’ There is nothing in the above to suggest that the aleatory sampling techniques he had described in Chapter 5 (Monte Carlo simulation) are anything other than fully applicable to the ensembles he now describes. And yet, Chapter 5 was predominantly about the modelling of variability, whereas now we have moved on to matters of incertitude, as characterized by models of varied structure. Just to reinforce the suspicion that Palmer sees nothing wrong with the adoption of aleatory methods to treat such epistemic uncertainty, on page 121 he reproduces a histogram showing the various estimates of climate sensitivity resulting from an ensemble of differently structured models. Over this he fits a probability distribution curve, seemingly unconcerned that this takes no account of the histogram’s decidedly non-stochastic representation of the space of possible model structures. This is precisely the normative practice to which I have referred above, and yet there is no hint in his book that he sees it as a pragmatic (albeit sub-optimal) expedient, or as a probabilistic treatment adopted only for the benefit of the policymakers. Indeed, he goes on to justify its legitimacy by reference to the concept of the ‘wisdom of the crowds.’ But this is a concept that only applies when the crowd acts entirely independently and is statistically representative. Of course, neither of these conditions apply to the currently available ‘crowd’ of climate models.” Ridgway identifies a major problem with the ensemble method advocated by Tim Palmer and widely used today – the method mixes different types of uncertainties some of which can be resolved with better data while others cannot. Additionally, Palmer writes some ideas of what his technique can resolve that are farfetched. Ridgway writes: “Armed with an ensemble of such models, Palmer sees great potential in tackling the epistemic uncertainties appertaining to our shared future: ‘Of course, such a digital ensemble twin would not only be able to tackle the socioeconomic problems of climate geoengineering, it should be able to provide credible estimates of future migration, future conflict, future health risks, future food supplies, the future health of the oceans and so on.’ Of course? It is far from obvious to me that a reliable ‘model of global society’ can be created by extending a stochastic model designed to forecast the outcome of a system’s variability.” Under “Problem number 2: The denial of subjectivity” Ridgway writes about “Personalist” interpretation of uncertainty that has no bearing in physical science. Physical science deals with verifiable, objective properties independent from one’s individual beliefs. The essays are useful in identifying types of uncertainties, some of which may reduce with more data or the use of appropriate data. Other uncertainties, such as turbulence, probably cannot be reduced even with better and faster computers. The knowledge does not exist. Additionally, our understanding of the formation and dissipation of clouds is lacking. For Ridgway’s essays, see links under Challenging the Orthodoxy and for aleatoric uncertainty see https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/aleatoric-uncertainty ********************* Climate Fingerprinting: Ridgway discusses Extreme Event Attribution (EEA) where probabilities are assigned that increasing carbon dioxide (global warming) increases the probability of a particular event (usually a natural disaster) occurring. Earlier, Allen and Tett (1999) claimed that the work satisfied the conditions of the Gauss-Markov theorem and the estimates are BLUE, [the Best (minimum variance), Linear, Unbiased, Estimator] for the calculation of the coefficient of the desired variable. Writing in the same Journal, Climate Dynamics, Ross McKitrick (2022) showed that the method did not produce BLUE results; the results were not unbiased and consistent estimates of the desired coefficient. A major problem is the lack of consistency of the error term, heteroscedasticity. In discussing Ross McKitrick’s latest work, John Robson writes: “A lot of observers including us have long suspected that the IPCC’s knack for always finding CO2 responsible for everything was probably an artifact of dodgy statistical practice rather than real-world effects. [Ross] McKitrick’s new analysis confirms our suspicions and adds to the evidence that in the real world outside climate models CO2 is not the control knob on global climate and natural variability matters a lot more than we’ve been told. And confirms our suspicions that far from being ‘settled,’ rigorous and, oh yeah, ‘simple,’ climate science neglects basic tools of the trade from the statistical to the testing of hypotheses to try to disprove them not to confirm them at all costs.’ See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy. ********************* In the Mire: In “Fixing the electricity system” Andrew Montford of Net Zero Watch addressed a main problem in the UK – the high and increasing cost of electricity to consumers and industry. His essay begins with [boldface added]: “The UK has the highest industrial electricity prices in the developed world, despite paying only average prices for gas. Independent research shows that years of high energy costs have made the cost-of-living voters’ top concern, fueling public anger and political polarization. Yet even sceptics of the renewables agenda often misunderstand the core problem. Cutting subsidies alone will not lower prices. As Octopus Energy and E.ON told Parliament’s Energy Security and Net Zero Committee, even if gas prices halved or fell to zero, electricity bills would still rise. But why? The reason lies in so-called ‘non-commodity costs’ – the cost of managing a grid rather than of generating the power. Because renewables are weather-dependent, spatially diffuse, and often located far from where power is needed, and moreover because they undermine the economics of the gas-fired fleet – vital for when the wind is not blowing – these costs are soaring. Energy experts, including Professors Dieter Helm and Gordon Hughes, have argued that such system costs are now the main driver of bills and – unlike with thermal power systems – will keep rising as more renewables are added. Cancelling subsidies might bring short-term relief, but, as long as intermittent generation grows, balancing and capacity market costs will escalate. Britain cannot reduce the cost of living, revive productivity, or restore economic growth without fixing its electricity system. To do this, UK politicians must confront not only subsidies, but the physical and contractual structures that make energy permanently expensive.” Energy consultant Kathryn Porter had a similar, grim question “How do we keep the lights on with 12 GW net firm capacity at risk of retirement by 2030?” in a speech to the Institution of Power Engineers. Paul Homewood summarizes key points with: “A total of 56 GW, facing peak winter demand of 48 GW. That capacity cannot be guaranteed 24/7, so 50 GW is more realistic. Moreover that 7 GW of batteries, plus 2.7 GW of pumped storage can only supply for an hour or so – enough to meet peak demand, but worthless for longer periods. As a result, we are already totally dependent on imported power at the times when wind power cannot meet demand. But the real value of Kathryn’s analysis is that she has identified how much gas power capacity we could potentially lose in the next few years. Not only is 12 GW at risk of closure by 2030, but another 6 GW could go by 2035.” See links under Questioning European Green. ********************* Literacy Through Censorship: The 30th Conference of Parties of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) concluded November 21, a new threat has emerged to modern civilization – UN censorship. Jo Nova links to a November 12 UN press release that states: “The Global Initiative for Information Integrity on Climate Change today launched the Declaration on Information Integrity on Climate Change at COP30, establishing shared international commitments to address climate disinformation and promote accurate, evidence-based information on climate issues. The Declaration commits signatories to promote the integrity of information related to climate change at international, national, and local levels, in line with international human rights law and the principles of the Paris Agreement. Drafted in collaboration with civil society members of the Global Initiative Advisory Group, the Declaration has been endorsed by ten countries so far – Brazil, Canada, Chile, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Spain, Sweden, and Uruguay. ‘Climate change is no longer a threat of the future; it is a tragedy of the present,’ said President of Brazil Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in Belém. ‘We live in an era in which obscurantists reject scientific evidence and attack institutions. It is time to deliver yet another defeat to denialism.’” Charles Rotter has additional views on the subsequent: “Declaration on Information Integrity on Climate Change.” See links under Censorship. ********************* Number of the Week: ~4.5 mm/year v. 1-2 mm/year. A paper in Nature Communications, Earth & Environment states: Over the past three decades, satellites have provided continuous, accurate measurements of sea level on near-global scales. Here, we show that since satellites began observing sea surface heights in 1993 until the end of 2023, global mean sea level has risen by 111 mm. In addition, the rate of global mean sea level rise over those three decades has increased from ~2.1 mm/year in 1993 to ~4.5 mm/year in 2023. If this trajectory of sea level rise continues over the next three decades, sea levels will increase by an additional 169 mm globally, comparable to mid-range sea level projections from the IPCC AR6. The reported satellite estimates are inconsistent with tidal gauge measurements taken at geological stable locations. Ole Humlum reports: “Tide gauges along coasts indicate a typical global sea level increase of about 1-2 mm/yr. Coastal sea level change rate last 100 year has essentially been stable, but with periodic variations.” See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy and Defending the Orthodoxy – Bandwagon Science.

VanDeveer, Professor of Global Governance & Human Security, The Conversation, Nov 14, 2025 [H/t Bernie Kepshire] The world has affordable renewable energy technologies with which to replace coal-fired electricity generation. Shifting to renewable energy also has added benefits: It’s much less harmful to the health of those who live and work nearby than mining and burning coal is. [SEPP Comment: Mining cobalt and lithium is clean and healthy?] Biden EPA Official: Trump’s EPA Is Knee-Capping U.S. Energy Dominance By Cynthia Giles, Real Clear Energy, Nov 19, 2025 Importing countries want oil and gas that hit three key benchmarks: reduced emissions from production and distribution, a robust system to curtail super-emitters – which are responsible for as much as 50% of emissions – and reliable monitoring and reporting so emission claims can be verified. That’s what EU rules require, and what other big importing countries are quickly moving toward.

Not modern satellite imagery, not historical data, not even the meteorological literature available before the book was published. If anyone still doubts how easily Solomon’s interpretation can be disproved, consider this: a single infrared satellite image is enough to show why her core assumption—that Corner Camp and Scott’s Last Camp always experience storms together—is scientifically untenable.

An unhealthy dose of unreality By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Nov 19, 2025 Not just a new plan, a new model. Or a plan to come up with a model. Not that they don’t have a bunch of words hovering in the shape of a plan: “the GFI [Green Finance Institute] is proposing a new model of so-called structured coordination that it’s dubbed “transactions to transitions.” COP30 is the world’s biggest trade show By David Wojick, CFACT, Nov 17, 2025 On the funny side, a few COPs ago, the UN started asking registrants about their ties to oil and gas companies. There turned out to be well over a thousand per COP, which is as many, or more than, the number of negotiators. I am sure a lot of oil and gas deals get started here. In fact, at COP28, the COP president, himself an oil executive, got yelled at for talking about making such deals. On that Flood of Fossil Fuel Lobbyists at COP30 How dare they! By Jit, Climate Scepticism, Nov 22, 2025 [H/t Bernie Kepshire] Probably, if you screwed your eyes up tightly, you could make out about half of the 1600 as having more than the most tenuous connection to fossil fuels.

Its history is littered with floods every bit as bad as this week’s. It might seem a daft place to build a town, but the Normans built the castle and town specifically because of those three rivers, allowing them to exert control over the river crossings. Since then, it continued to thrive because of its communication links. #HaveItBothWays: Drought in the UK By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Nov 19, 2025 Whether the UK gets wetter or drier in the future, you can rest assured that climate science predicted it and you’re to blame either way.

Lowering Standards The BBC: My Part In Its Downfall By Iain Macwhirter, The Daily Sceptic, Nov 14, 2025 As critical friends like the former BBC politics presenter Andrew Marr and the former defence correspondent Mark Urban have pointed out, there is now a generation of activist-minded graduates running BBC programs who think that they should, like broadcasters in wartime, be taking sides. They think the BBC should be promoting social justice, opposing environmental catastrophe and depriving anti-immigrant populists of the oxygen of publicity. Only they cannot do this and still be the BBC proper. Iain Macwhirter, a former BBC political correspondent and TV presenter, is a columnist for the Times and the author of Disunited Kingdom. Oh heh heh that transition By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Nov 19, 2025 The International Energy Agency [IEA], which does seem to have become the International Anti-Energy Agency recently, has the good grace to admit that zealotry had overwhelmed judgement.

From Eschenbach: If you want to monitor the AMOC, measure it directly. Don’t use proxy tea leaves from a noisy, complex region, filtered through biased models, and call it a “superior fingerprint.” Climate Scientists Claim That Global Warming Is Going To Cause A New Ice Age? By Tyler Durden, Zero Hedge, Nov 18, 2025 [H/t S.J. Cvrk] One thing that is true is that global cooling would be more dangerous to the Earth than global warming. The most recent Ice Age was a devastating event that is projected to have killed up to 150,000 non-microbe species. On a grand scale of Earth-time, we have barely exited that disaster which ended 11,000 years ago.

By Francis Menton, Manhattan Contrarian, Nov 15, 2025 So, they have actually calculated that the attempt to reach “net zero” emissions on the statutorily-mandated schedule will cost consumers an extra $42 billion per year by 2040. They don’t give us numbers for other years, but presumably other years would be comparable. So, figure, $42 billion per year. Let’s say that that is slightly different from wind and solar being “cheaper” than our existing fossil fuel infrastructure. The true source of civilization’s future is energy wisdom By Ronald Stein, Armando Cavanha, & Yoshihiro Muronaka, America Out Loud News, Nov 17, 2025 For an engineer, the distinction between efficiency and saving is fundamental. Efficiency is a design challenge: achieving a task with the minimum input through better engineering. Saving, on the other hand, is often a behavioral practice: using less through habit or restraint. Non-Green Jobs Wirtschaftlicher Selbstmord [Economic Suicide] By Willis Eschenbach, WUWT, Nov 20, 2025 Adjusted for population size, that’s as if in six months every single factory worker in North Carolina lost their job. The Germans thought they could run a post-industrial society on hope, regulations, and a few clouds of solar panels—but you can’t repeal the laws of economics, any more than you can run a steel mill on good intentions. Now the bill is coming due. Funding Issues An unhealthy fixation By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Nov 19, 2025 It is to some people, apparently. The same ones who think it’s all fun and games for some otherwise undistinguished politician to redo the Industrial Revolution and get it better this time… until someone loses a pension fund. The Political Games Continue A momentary outbreak of sensibleness in Australia By Jo Nova, Her Blog, Nov 21, 2025 A new day dawns Downunder For the first time in years, the Opposition doesn’t sound like a schoolgirl (well, not all the time). And, suddenly the government has realized they shouldn’t go burning $2 billion on a COP31 All of this pain has achieved nothing. When the Coalition left office, emissions were 28 per cent below 2005 levels. Today they are just 28.7 per cent below 2005 levels. Labor talks tough on climate but has delivered virtually no emissions reductions and higher costs. This is abject policy failure.

There is only one answer to the problem of looming blackouts – begin immediately on a large-scale rollout of new CCGT power stations. If we do that, of course, there is no economic value in building any further wind and solar capacity, so AR7 and future CfD rounds need to be cancelled.

They’ve sent a Special Rapporteur, Astrid Puentes Riano, to join three cases in Federal Courts in an amicus curiae role. She is here to cast a spell and see if she gets lucky and scores some shake-down-money in reparations. It was only a few months ago the International Court of Climate Justice (ICJ) declared that nice weather was a “human right”, thus supposedly allowing the whole world to sue everyone else, ad infinitum for bad weather. Energy Issues — US Rising Electricity Prices: The Missing Link By Jonathan Lesser, Real Clear Energy, Nov 20, 2025 The reality is that many factors are contributing to rising electricity rates, especially the rapid increases that households and businesses have experienced over the last five years. But the various studies have overlooked a key factor: the changing mix of generating resources, as traditional fossil fuel and nuclear plants have been replaced by wind and solar ones. When Energy Is Done Right, a Rising Tide Will Lift All Boats By Gary Abernathy, Real Clear Energy, Nov 18, 2025 As China launches an AI Manhattan Project, US AI Support is buckling under High Energy Prices By Eric Worrall, WUWT, Nov 21, 2025 Developing the technology alone is not enough. The USA didn’t start the current AI push. The University of Toronto developed the critical breakthrough which made the current AI revolution possible in 2012. But aside from some Canadian islands of research excellence, Canada is not a serious player in the AI race. Canada’s obsession with green energy and moribund economy gave the USA the edge – an edge the USA is now in danger of losing to China.

It would replace a Biden administration-era plan that proposed just three offshore lease sales, all in the Gulf of Mexico, between the years 2024 and 2029. Nuclear Energy and Fears A Nuclear Resurgence, But Major Obstacles Remain By Steve Goreham, Master Resource, Nov 20, 2025 Artificial intelligence needs 24-hour, 7-day, always-on power, which intermittent wind and solar can’t provide. Companies that have committed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions view nuclear as a zero-emissions source to power AI. Today, natural gas is the preferred onsite electricity source for new data centers in the US. Over 200 gas-fired power plants are in planning or under construction nationwide, including more than 100 new gas plants in Texas alone.

By Dane Gregoris, et al., Enverus Intelligence® Research, 2025 From report: 2025 Will Be the Year of DAC, EVS and Advanced Nuclear Reactors From Proctor: EIR said installed U.S. power capacity is forecast to grow 57% by 2050, with the next quarter-century defined by three eras: rapid solar energy growth (2025–2035), coal replacement (2035–2040), and steady nuclear expansion (2040–2050). [SEPP Comment: Appears to be a promo piece. Question continuation of “rapid solar energy growth” and DAC (direct air capture of carbon dioxide and subsequent storage).] Solar’s Next Chapter: Beyond Incentives By Fox Swim, Power Mag, Nov 16, 2025 The ITC [Investment Tax Credit] may be coming to an end, but the momentum it created endures. The future of solar now depends on innovation, transparency, and adaptability to thrive no matter what policies are put in our way. Renewable energy is cheaper and healthier – so why isn’t it replacing fossil fuels faster? By Jay Gulledge, The Conversation, Nov 17, 2025 [H/t Bernie Kepshire] A decade ago, the cheapest way to meet growing demand for electricity was to build more coal or natural gas power plants. Not anymore. Solar and wind power aren’t just better for the climate; they’re also less expensive today than fossil fuels at utility scale, and they’re less harmful to people’s health. Yet renewable energy projects face headwinds, including in the world’s fast-growing developing countries. I study energy and climate solutions and their impact on society, and I see ways to overcome those challenges and expand renewable energy – but it will require international cooperation. [SEPP Comment: Another professor who does not understand the importance of reliability in modern society.] Sunnova: Autopsy of a ‘Green’ Failure By Robert Bradley Jr., Master Resource, Nov 18, 2025 Led by the toothy Enron-ex John Berger (who made millions of dollars at the expense of just about everyone else, including taxpayers), Sunnova is yet another case study of business failure under political capitalism (versus free-market capitalism). Alternative, Green (“Clean”) Vehicles Ever Diminishing Vehicles We’re winning so hard, it hurts By JIT, Climate Scepticism, Nov 18, 2025 [Bernie Kepshire] The final figure shows the total car production in the UK, as reported by the SMMT, whether for domestic supply or export, by month. I think I see a trend there. If you put a line through the data since the ZEV [Zero-Emissions Vehicle mandate] began, the slope is -6500 cars per month per year. That puts the UK car industry as extinct by 2035. Health, Energy, and Climate Counting the Dead: Media Drama Warps Reality By Chuck Dinerstein, MD,, ACSH, Nov 14, 2025 Link to article: Does the news reflect what we die from? What do Americans die from, and what do the New York Times, Washington Post, and Fox News report on? By Hannah Ritchie, Tuna Acisu, and Edouard Mathieu, Our World in Data, Oct 6, 2025 From Dinerstein: The data exposes a sobering truth: the media landscape no longer reflects the statistical reality of the world but the emotional reality of what captures attention. Headlines reflect not the greatest dangers to our lives, but the strongest reactions of our hearts When the media amplifies the rare and sensational, it warps our collective sense of risk, steering fear and policy toward the exceptional instead of the everyday. From Hype to Evidence: Rethinking Microplastic Pollution in Our Foods By Chuck Dinerstein, MD, ACSH, Nov 17, 2025 Public concern about microplastics has grown rapidly—often outpacing the evidence. The European Food Safety Agency’s comprehensive review shows that while microplastics can indeed be released from food contact materials, the quantities are far lower than many early studies suggested, and most data on nanoplastics are still unreliable or missing altogether. Much of the apparent risk has been amplified by inconsistent testing methods, contamination, and the misidentification of non-plastic residues as plastic particles. This does not mean we should dismiss the issue. It means we should keep it in proportion. The science to date tells us that microplastic release from everyday packaging is a real but limited phenomenon, not a looming public health crisis. A healthy dose of reality By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Nov 19, 2025 Like those at the Globe & Mail who just wrote “For the health of Canadians, the health care sector must decarbonize now”. Right, that’s the priority. Millions of Canadians have no family doctor, and the population faces some of the world’s longest waits for essential surgeries. Other News that May Be of Interest The Congressional Minerals Mandate By Rich Nolan, Real Clear Energy, Nov 17, 2025 Why the chemtrail conspiracy theory lingers and grows – and why Tucker Carlson is talking about it By Calum Lister Matheson, The Conversation, Nov 14, 2025 [H/t Bernie Kepshire] Conspiracies are dramatic and exciting, with clear lines of good and evil, whereas real life is boring and sometimes scary. The chemtrail theory is ultimately prideful. It’s a way for theorists to feel powerful and smart when they face things beyond their comprehension and control. Conspiracy theories come and go but responding to them in the long-term means finding better ways to embrace uncertainty, ambiguity and our own limits alongside a new embrace of the tools we do have; logic, evidence and even humility. BELOW THE BOTTOM LINE Satellite-Borne Mirrors Would Light Up the Skies at Night to Boost Solar Power By Bonner Russell Cohen, Real Clear Energy, Nov 19, 2025 The orbital dynamics of rapidly moving satellites — orbiting the Earth at a speed of 4.7 miles per second — further undermine the efficiency of “sunlight on demand.” “To a static location on the ground, as computed by astronomers Michael J. I. Brown and Matt Kenworthy, that means each satellite will be within 1000 km [621 miles] of a given location on the ground for no more than 210 seconds (or 3.5 minutes) per orbit,” Siegel adds. “And you’d need thousands of them, all reflecting sunlight to the same location on the ground, to generate any power at all.” COP30 On Fire! By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Nov 20, 2025 Video Doctors dance at COP30 to demand a fossil fuel phase-out Video from AP, Via WUWT, Nov 19, 2025 A group of Canadian doctors danced to hip-hop at the U.N. climate talks in Brazil, calling for a global phase-out of fossil fuels. They say clean energy isn’t just a climate issue, it’s a public health one. Friday Funny: COPs 1-30 – A perfect record of failure By Anthony Watts, WUWT, Nov 21, 2025 ARTICLES NO ARTICLES THIS WEEK Subscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email. Type your email… Subscribe “Yes, but this was obvious long before the first models were created. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, and thus the more of it added to the atmosphere, the higher surface temperature should rise.” Conclusion by inference. About as basic a violation of the scientific method as is possible, Sorry David, but in Immediately conceding the central ground of the dispute, the plot has been lost Some here may not forgive me the analogy, but what was done here is as though an atheist in a dispute began with, ‘yeah, the bible is true, but …’ One should study David Dibbell’s video showing the ERA5 Reanalysis Energy Conversion in the Atmosphere, to gain the critical view of increased carbon dioxide. Spoiler alert: the energetic impact of all emitted CO2 is about 10% of the width of the zero-tick, in a energy-dynamic traversing (+/-)10,000 W/m^2. The climatological effect of CO2 is revealed to be indistinguishable from zero. And climate model uncertainty? The physical theory deployed in climate models is critically deficient. A model tuned to speciously reproduce a warming trend will successfully extrapolate the future trend so long as the trend continues. Empirical extrapolations are not predictions in any scientific sense. As Chris Essex long ago noted, tuned parameters are ad hoc conservation laws that have no basis in physics. They impose climate stasis. Ad hoc laws and deficient theory make both simulations of future climate and air temperature projections themselves physically meaningless, no matter model statistical skill in extrapolation. The models are utterly unreliable – a fact already known. Pace David, but in hard ball, one doesn’t concede a home run. Thanks, Pat – I had the exact same issue with Dave’s analysis of ‘Forecast number 1’ last week: https://wattsupwiththat.com/2025/11/19/just-how-good-were-the-early-climate-models/#comment-4133138 Thanks right back, Frank. So far as I can see, your view is dead-on. But the article asserts that early climate model forecasts about global warming were correct decades before the forecasts could be evaluated. That is much like claiming that a Volkswagen has an acceleration identical to a Ferrari. It is a qualitative assessment recognizing that both can gain speed over time, but purposely ignores that the quantitative increases over time are very dissimilar. Qualitatively, they share a positive slope; however, quantitatively the accelerations are very different. Alarmists commonly wave their arms around to attract attention, but then fail to provide measurements to support their claims. It is said that mathematics is the language of science. Innumerate claims supported only by poorly-defined ‘lawyer words’ demonstrate that the claims are not supported by science. Something cannot be right and wrong at the same time. One or the other must be right, not both at the same time. The defining characteristic of a change like warming is the rate of change of the temperature with respect to time, which is the instantaneous change defined as the slope or the tangent to the temperature function at a particular time. I would submit that “early climate model forecasts” were not correct. Some were so wrong quantitatively as to be absurd. To claim that they all were correct suggests that those making such a claim never took a calculus class. The collection of early forecasts, all being quite different, serves to prove that nobody knew what they were talking about, even as late as 1988 when Hansen produced several different scenarios, all giving different results based on different assumptions. The only conclusion justified by the qualitative claims is that Earth has been warming for about 20,000 years and will probably continue to for at least a similar length of time. However, quantitatively, warming 1 degree C over the next century is not the same as warming 10 or 20 degrees in the same amount of time. It is sophistry to suggest that they are the same. Xeno’s Paradox has similarly been proven to be illogical by calculus. “…the world’s most viewed climate website” – Fred Pearce The Climate Files: The Battle for the Truth about Global Warming “…invaluable” – Steven F.
