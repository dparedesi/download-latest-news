The ₹2,150-crore IPO is entirely a fresh issue by the company, with no offer-for-sale component. Against an offer size of about 17.71 crore shares, the IPO received bids for 11.82 crore shares, subscribing 0.67 times. The IPO will close on May 23. The price band for the offer has been pegged at ₹85-90 per share, and investors can bid for a minimum of 166 equity shares. The offer is being made through the book-building process, wherein not more than 50 per cent of the offer shall be available for allocation on a proportionate basis to qualified institutional buyers, not less than 15 per cent for allocation to non-institutional bidders, and up to 35 per cent of the offer to retail investors. While the quota for non-institutional investors, generally referred to as HNIs, was subscribed 1.44 times, the retail portion elicited 0.48 times subscription and the institutional quota 0.42 times. Ahead of the IPO, Belrise Industries on Tuesday garnered ₹645 crore from anchor investors. The company informed the bourses that it had allocated 71,666,665 shares at ₹90 per share to anchor investors. The investors who participated in the anchor book include foreign institutions such as BlackRock, Capital Group, M&G, and Pinebridge, and domestic institutions such as ICICI Prudential MF, HDFC MF, Nippon India MF, ValueQuest, and Bajaj Allianz Life. The proceeds from the fresh issue, to the extent of ₹1,618.13 crore, will be used for repayment or prepayment, in full or in part, of certain borrowings availed by the company, and for general corporate purposes. Belrise Industries Ltd (BIL) is an automotive component manufacturing company, offering a diverse range of safety critical systems and other engineering solutions for two-wheelers, three-wheelers, four-wheelers, commercial vehicles, and agri-vehicles. Its product portfolio includes metal chassis systems, polymer components, suspension systems, body-in-white components, and exhaust systems, among others. BIL’s products are largely agnostic to vehicle powertrain types, reflecting its ability in catering to both electric vehicles and internal combustion engine vehicles, thus positioning it favourably to adapt to the growing electric vehicle market. The company specialises in precision sheet metal pressing and fabrication (i.e., the process of joining sheet metal components to create unified structures for assembling vehicle subsystems and bodies), and had a market share of 24 per cent in the overall two-wheeler metal components segment in India as of March 31, 2024, in terms of revenue (Source: CRISIL Report). Belrise has a long-standing relationship with OEMs such as Bajaj Auto Limited, Honda Motorcycle & Scooter India Private Limited, Hero MotoCorp Limited, Jaguar Land Rover Limited, and Royal Enfield Motors Limited, among others. Belrise Industries’ revenue from operations increased by 13.70 per cent to ₹7,484.24 crore for the financial year 2024, from ₹6,582.50 crore for the financial year 2023, primarily attributable to an increase in product sales and higher prices of raw materials and components. Profit after tax for FY24 stood at ₹310.88 crore. For the nine months ended December 31, 2024, revenue from operations stood at ₹6,013.43 crore, and profit after tax stood at ₹245.47 crore. Axis Capital Limited, Jefferies India Private Limited, HSBC Securities and Capital Markets (India) Private Limited, and SBI Capital Markets Limited are the book-running lead managers, while MUFG Intime India Private Limited is the registrar to the issue.

The rebound is buoyed by renewed risk appetite from investors as President Trump has toned down his trade war rhetoric, seeking deals with trading partners after slapping them with sizable tariffs. Still, Bitcoin has more room to run, according to the experts—with some industry observers predicting a $200,000 top. Others are predicting even higher jumps, whether they're expected later this year or beyond. Here’s a look at some of the massive targets that crypto experts have placed on Bitcoin lately. Adam Back, Blockstream CEO: $500,000 to $1 million this cycle Blockstream boss and Bitcoin legend Adam Back spoke to Decrypt last week, and predicted the biggest and oldest digital coin would hit $500,000 to $1 million this cycle. In an interview, the computer scientist said that the price of BTC was surprisingly low at this point after last year’s halving, considering all the institutional money involved. "I think if you get a new all-time high, it could quickly become a lot higher,” he said. Standard Chartered: $200,000 this year British bank Standard Chartered’s digital assets research team is bullish, to say the least. The bank’s Global Head of Digital Assets Research Geoffrey Kendrick has repeatedly said that the virtual coin would soar this year—despite Trump tariffs and other geopolitical factors—and is predicting a $200,000 high by the end of 2025. His reasoning? U.S.-based investors wanting a non-sovereign asset. "We expect a strategic asset reallocation away from U.S. assets to trigger the next sharp upswing in Bitcoin in the coming months," he said in April. Even more bullish is the analyst's outlook for the next few years: $500,000 per coin by the time President Trump leaves office at the start of 2029. Bernstein: $200,000 this bull run Investment firm Bernstein has also bet on Bitcoin's price hitting new highs, with analysts at the firm regularly saying that institutional money will be the main driver. The firm expects companies to snap up $330 billion in Bitcoin over the next five years. "The Bitcoin genie is out of the bottle, and it is hard to reverse this course," Bernstein analysts said last year before crypto-friendly President Trump won the U.S. election. Bernstein analysts in 2024 and this year have forecast that BTC's price will end 2025 at $200,000. Arthur Hayes: $150,000 in 2025 Billionaire entrepreneur Arthur Hayes is known for his outlandish predictions—even once referring to long-term forecasts as "pretty shit." Still, the former BitMEX boss knows his macro and has predicted intense central bank money printing to push BTC's price to the moon. Similar to Standard Chartered, he thinks investors will want to leave American assets behind. "Bitcoin is the perfect and only lifeboat for global capital that must leave America and elsewhere," he wrote in a recent blog post, predicting a $150,000 high this year. Tim Draper: $250,000 this year Billionaire investor Tim Draper recently went as far as to say that companies that didn't hold BTC on their balance sheets were being "irresponsible." The Silicon Valley venture capital investor and founder of Draper Associates said earlier this month that by the end of 2025, he believes Bitcoin will hit $250,000, noting a "gravitational pull toward Bitcoin." BlackRock's Larry Fink: $700,000… eventually BlackRock boss Larry Fink, who has massively helped institutions get involved in buying BTC with the launch of the popular iShares Bitcoin Trust, said that the coin could hit $700,000. Speaking in January at the World Economic Forum in Davos, the CEO of the world's largest asset manager said that if institutions like sovereign wealth funds continued to make even small allocations to the asset, the orange coin's price would rocket upwards. But the Wall Street titan did add that he wasn't promoting the cryptocurrency with his bullish bet. Brian Armstrong: Multi-millions… at some point The CEO of America's biggest crypto exchange Coinbase forecast in January that Bitcoin will be worth "multiple millions”—at some point in the future. Brian Armstrong, who founded the San Francisco, California-based exchange in 2012, said that nation-state adoption would help propel the asset that high. "I think over time we'll see Bitcoin get into the multiple millions price range," he said. Still, Armstrong, whose firm has contracts with the U.S. government, added that BTC has a long way to go before rising that high.

Title: Mike Novogratz Says Weakening Dollar, Widening Deficit and America’s Deteriorating Financial Situation ‘Very Good’ for Bitcoin and Crypto

The chief executive of crypto asset manager Galaxy Digital says America’s current financial situation is bullish for Bitcoin (BTC) and crypto. In a new interview with Bloomberg, Novogratz says that many factors have contributed to the rise of digital assets, including President Donald Trump and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink’s embrace of the sector. “It started with Larry Fink. When he got orange-pilled, the largest asset manager in the world said ‘this is a real asset,’ at least Bitcoin, that everyone should be a part of and lots of other companies… followed suit. And that was kind of round one of institutions coming in. But really it was the shift of approach from the Gary Gensler SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) to this Trump Administration which has just embraced our industry, and that freed up the animal spirit, both here and abroad.” However, Novogratz goes on to say that America’s current uncertain fiscal situation is ultimately good for the top crypto asset by market cap and the digital assets industry in general. He says the Trump administration’s failure to significantly lower the debt-to-GDP ratio has been a boon for the asset class. “We’re in a really hard position as a country… We have this kind of debt, yield curves are selling off everywhere, the dollar is under pressure, and that all is very good for Bitcoin and crypto assets as well.” BTC is trading for $108,961 at time of writing, just below a new all-time high.

As hedge funds trimmed their Magnificent Seven positions in the first quarter, they increasingly turned their attention toward some other stocks. In Goldman Sachs' Hedge Fund Trend Monitor published May 20, the firm highlighted 20 stocks that an increasing number of hedge funds added to their holdings in that period. That heightened interest could be a sign that the stocks are primed for strong returns in the months ahead, the bank said. "Historically, stocks with the largest increase in the number of hedge fund investors ('Rising Stars') have typically gone on to outperform sector peers during the quarters following their rise in popularity," said the note, authored by a team of strategists led by Ben Snider, a managing director. The utilities, financials, and consumer discretionary sectors each had five stocks on the list. Two have AI exposure: Sempra and Kinder Morgan. The average market cap of the 20 stocks on the list is $17 billion. We've listed the stocks below, along with their net gain in the number of funds that own them.

Title: Bitcoin ownership surpasses gold in the US as 50M Americans hold BTC
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/bitcoin-ownership-surpasses-gold-in-the-us-as-50m-americans-hold-btc/
Time Published: 2025-05-21T15:13:56Z
Full Content:
Bitcoin has officially outpaced gold in US ownership, marking a significant pivot in the country’s investment landscape. According to a new report released on 20 May by Bitcoin investment firm River, roughly 50 million Americans now own Bitcoin, compared to 37 million who own gold. This data underscores the rise of Bitcoin as a preferred store of value, reshaping traditional notions of economic security and reserve asset status. As Bitcoin ownership expands, it’s increasingly seen not just as a speculative instrument, but as a fundamental part of US financial infrastructure. The River report notes that the United States is the global leader in Bitcoin adoption, with 40 percent of all Bitcoin-related companies headquartered in the country. American firms also hold 94.8 percent of all Bitcoin owned by publicly traded companies worldwide, reflecting significant institutional backing. This dominance is supported by a robust ecosystem comprising crypto-focused startups, spot ETF launches, and policies promoting digital asset development. Regulatory momentum in Washington has further strengthened Bitcoin’s foundation in the financial system. Recent discussions around treating Bitcoin as a potential strategic reserve asset suggest growing political acceptance. Several politicians have floated the idea of the US government maintaining a Bitcoin reserve, signalling institutional confidence amid rising concerns over the US dollar’s long-term stability. The shift toward Bitcoin is occurring alongside broader macroeconomic concerns. Moody’s recent downgrade of the US credit rating—ending over a century of top-tier ratings—has reinforced the appeal of decentralised alternatives. Investors increasingly view Bitcoin as a hedge against fiscal instability and inflation, particularly given its fixed supply and decentralised governance model. Bitcoin also offers practical advantages over gold in the digital age. The ease of storage, cross-border transfer, and liquidity make it an attractive option for both individual and institutional investors. This is particularly relevant in an era where digital finance is becoming the norm and where traditional safe-haven assets like gold face logistical and accessibility limitations. While Bitcoin is gaining legitimacy as a reserve asset, it remains a volatile asset class. Unlike gold, which has maintained relatively steady valuations over time, Bitcoin has experienced frequent price swings—something that may deter more risk-averse investors. Nonetheless, the market appears to be increasingly tolerant of this volatility, especially as long-term returns continue to outperform traditional assets. Institutional support also plays a key role in this shift. Major asset managers such as BlackRock are incorporating Bitcoin into their portfolios, further validating its status. Meanwhile, crypto ETFs and custodial services are helping to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the digital asset space, making it easier for Americans to gain exposure to Bitcoin without navigating complex self-custody solutions. As Bitcoin ownership grows, it reflects not just a shift in preference, but a broader transformation in how Americans perceive financial security and resilience. The trend is still developing, but the numbers now place Bitcoin squarely ahead of gold—at least in terms of how many Americans are betting on it.

Title: Welcoming Jon Xu and Andrew Miklas as YC’s Newest General Partners

Time Published: 2025-05-21T15:00:00Z
Full Content:
by Garry Tan5/21/2025 Over the last few batches, visiting partners Jon Xu and Andrew Miklas have become two of the most trusted voices in the YC community. They were both founders in YC’s Summer 2010 batch, and now, 15 years and two industry-shaping companies later, they’re back in a new role: General Partners at YC. As visiting partners, Jon and Andrew have already made a big impact, working closely with hundreds of founders across multiple batches. Now, as full-time General Partners, they’ll play an even bigger role in selecting, advising, and supporting the companies we back. They bring deep technical experience, firsthand startup grit, and a strong track record of helping early-stage companies grow – all of which makes them a perfect fit for YC’s mission to help ambitious founders build enduring companies from the earliest stages. Jon is the co-founder and former CTO of FutureAdvisor (YC S10), one of the first robo-advisors to make quality investment management accessible to a broader consumer audience. After the company was acquired by BlackRock in 2015, Jon continued to lead product and engineering, building an enterprise-grade robo-advisor platform for large financial institutions. His background gives him unique expertise both in building high-trust consumer products and B2B platforms for regulated industries. Andrew co-founded PagerDuty (YC S10, NYSE:PD), which became the backbone of digital operations for thousands of businesses. As founding CTO, he designed the original product and its high-availability architecture, and scaled the engineering team to 70+ people. After PagerDuty, he became an early-stage investor at s28 Capital, supporting companies like Clerk, CaptivateIQ, and Teleport. Andrew brings deep experience in building resilient systems and scaling engineering teams from zero to impact. At YC, we’re always looking for ways to meet the needs of the most ambitious founders. Adding Jon and Andrew to our team strengthens our bench of technical leaders who’ve built durable companies – and who know what it takes to turn early-stage ideas into something world-changing. We’re lucky to have them, and our founders will be even luckier.

Title: Crypto’s Market Penetration Tipping Point

You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. The digital assets market has transformed from a niche experiment into a global force reshaping finance, commerce, and technology. In May 2025, the global crypto market is valued at $3.05 trillion, growing at a pace on par with the internet boom in the 90s. Historical adoption curves for technologies like the internet and smartphones demonstrate that 10% penetration often marks a tipping point, after which growth accelerates exponentially due to network effects and mainstream acceptance. Digital assets are now on this trajectory, driven by rising user adoption, institutional investment and innovative use cases. After years of public uncertainty, a pivotal milestone may be achieved this year: cryptocurrency user penetration can surpass the critical 10% threshold, estimated to reach 11.02% globally in 2025 by Statista, up from 7.41% in 2024. The chart below compares the early user adoption curves of cryptocurrency and the internet. It highlights that crypto is growing at a significantly faster rate than the internet did in its early years. With crypto expected to cross the 10% threshold of adoption in 2025, it is important to note that the 10% mark is not arbitrary —- it’s a well-documented tipping point in technology diffusion, rooted in Everett Rogers’ diffusion of innovations theory. This model shows that adoption shifts from early adopters (13.5%) to the early majority (34%) at around 10–15% penetration, marking the transition from niche to mainstream. Crossing 10% market penetration triggers rapid growth as infrastructure, accessibility and social acceptance align. Two very recent examples of this are the smartphone and the internet. For cryptocurrencies, surpassing 10% penetration in 2025 would signal a similar inflection point, with network effects amplifying adoption — more users increase liquidity, merchant acceptance and developer activity, making crypto more practical for everyday transactions like payments and remittances. In the U.S., 28% of adults (approximately 65 million people) own cryptocurrencies in 2025, nearly doubling from 15% in 2021. Additionally, 14% of non-owners plan to enter the market this year, and 66% of current owners intend to buy more, reflecting significant momentum. Globally, two out of three American adults are familiar with digital assets, signaling a sharp departure from its earlier speculative reputation. These figures underscore the growing mainstream acceptance of digital assets, aligning with the post-10% adoption surge observed in other transformative technologies. Crypto’s economic impact spans remittances, cross-border trade, and financial inclusion, particularly in Africa and Asia, where it empowers the unbanked. Several factors are propelling crypto past the 10% threshold: Institutional and business involvement is accelerating digital assets’ mainstream integration. Major financial players like BlackRock and Fidelity are going all in on crypto services and have launched crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with 72 ETFs awaiting SEC approval in 2025. Businesses are adopting crypto payments to cut fees and reach global customers, particularly in retail and e-commerce. Examples include Burger King in Germany accepting bitcoin since 2019 and PayPal’s 2024 partnership with MoonPay for U.S. crypto purchases. Platforms like Coinbase Commerce and Triple-A, alongside partnerships like Ingenico and Crypto.com, enable merchants to accept crypto with local currency settlements, reducing volatility risks. DeFi activity has increased significantly in Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, and Eastern Europe. In Eastern Europe, DeFi accounted for over 33% of total crypto received, with the region placing third globally in year-over-year DeFi growth. Despite its momentum, digital assets face hurdles: Still, the trajectory is promising. Bullish sentiment and crypto-friendly regulators, coupled with ETF momentum and payment integrations, underscore this trajectory. If innovation continues to balance out with trust, digital assets are likely to follow the internet and smartphone playbook — and grow even faster.

Title: World’s Largest Alternative Asset Manager Discloses Modest Stake In BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF In First-Ever Crypto Bet

Blackstone, which considers itself to be the “world’s largest alternative asset manager,” has dipped its toes into crypto, purchasing shares in BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). According to a May 20 filing, Blackstone bought just around $1.08 million worth of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), despite boasting approximately $1.2 trillion in assets under management. Blackstone reported holding 23,094 shares of IBIT at the end of the fiscal quarter ending March 31. The IBIT shares were added to Blackstone’s Alternative Multi-Strategy Fund (BTMIX), which holds $2.63 billion worth of assets, as per Google Finance data. This is the first time the asset manager has disclosed investing in anything crypto-related. Despite IBIT’s outstanding performance, it appears that Blackstone is not yet ready to commit substantial capital to investing in the apex crypto. It’s worth mentioning that Blackstone has largely steered clear of crypto. Back in September 2019, Blackstone co-founder and CEO Stephen Schwarzman said he liked the blockchain technology but thought its use for money was “pretty odd.” “[I was] raised in a world where someone needs to control currencies,” he noted at the time. Schwarzman further admitted he wasn’t much of a fan of Bitcoin, citing difficulties understanding the technology. BlackRock’s IBIT has drawn in a net inflow of over $46 billion since it went live on Wall Street in January 2024, signaling institutions’ persistent confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted in a recent post on X that BlackRock is now the second-biggest Bitcoin holder globally, trailing only the mysterious BTC inventor Satoshi Nakamoto. Balchunas believes the asset manager is poised to surpass Satoshi’s holdings by next summer. The pundit reckons that if the Bitcoin price climbs to $150,000 in the coming months, it could spark a “feeding frenzy” among financial advisors, which would help BlackRock attain this milestone even more quickly.

Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning As the Dublin Airport passenger cap row rumbles on, the Government has been asked to consider a “high speed bus network” for the Shannon catchment area as part of a strategy to wrest aircraft traffic from Dublin Airport. As Mark Hilliard reports, in a letter outlining the need for a fundamental rethink of aviation policy across the island, Shannon Airport Group chief executive Mary Considine also argued the west of Ireland terminal would probably see a rail link before the capital. Meanwhile Hugh Dooley reports that three of Ireland’s regional airports are set to share nearly €8 million in government funding to fund capital development projects. The funding will support 33 capital investment projects improving the safety and security at Kerry, Ireland West, and Donegal airports, as well as sustainability efforts at a cost of €7.82m. Thinking about getting a new mortgage? The days of the only option being the big banks are well and truly behind us. In Money Matters, Joanne Hunt takes you through the options.

Title: US Ambassador to Israel: 'America is your friend—we stand with Israel against evil'
URL: https://www.israelnationalnews.com/news/408688
Time Published: 2025-05-20T20:10:15Z
Full Content:
In a defiant and impassioned address in Tel Aviv, US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee declared that the alliance between Israel and the United States is not only unshaken—it’s indivisible. Speaking to an audience of Israel’s top economic leaders, Huckabee rejected any notion of drifting ties between the nations. Framing Iran as the common source of regional threats, he vowed unwavering US support for Israel. "To anyone who says that the paths of Israel and the US are going their separate ways, that there is a conflict between them or that they are moving away from each other, I say: that is not what is happening. The only thing that was separated in this part of the world was the Red Sea, when Moses parted it in two to allow the Israelites to pass. I came here today in the name of friendship and gratitude," declared the US Ambassador at a festive reception held in his honor by the Ministry of Finance and the Israel Securities Authority on Tuesday evening, in the presence of the heads of the economy. Huckabee added that he "prays that God will cross the Red Sea again and allow the kidnapped to return home." “I realize that as I stand here tonight there are enemies poised to do any and everything they can to destroy you, to take you down and to take your future and your hope away. But they won't be able to do it. On all sides, whether it's Hamas, Hezbollah or the Houthis. I've said several times this week, it doesn't matter who brings the plate of hate to Israel to try to destroy you. We know where the kitchen is. The kitchen from which all of these really deadly disease dishes come from is from Iran and you're standing up against this evil monster, who for 46 years has said they're going to destroy you. But then they say once they're finished with you, they come after us. You're the appetizer, we're the entrée. Americans need to understand that the reason it matters what you do is because how you handle this threat is how we will ultimately have to handle this threat. Your enemies are our enemies and I hope it's always true that your friends are our friends. I say this from the bottom of my heart, America is your friend. We're your partner. We will stand with you. We must. We can't afford to pay the alimony of the divorce. So I hope you like us; you're stuck with us and I hope Americans will always love you because we feel like we're stuck with you too. God bless you.” Huckabee emphasized that "we (the US and Israel) are partners, we are not just stakeholders cooperating to advance their own selfish interests. Israel is not just our business partner, we also benefit from Israel's economic strength." He also noted "the strength of the Israeli economy in the midst of war, against all the international pressure, and frankly, against the backdrop of international madness." Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich also addressed the strength of relations between the countries: "We believe that the coming period will be a new high in relations between Israel and the US: an economic partnership that will bring more investments and more cooperation, regional moves that will position Israel as a strategic center connecting the Middle East, Europe and Asia, and an ideological infrastructure of a connection between tradition and innovation and freedom." Smotrich noted that Huckabee is "not just an ambassador of a country but a true friend" of Israel. "The Israeli economy has stood a huge test and emerged from it stronger than ever," said Smotrich. "The Israeli shekel is stronger today than on the eve of the war. This is not just the result of market trends - it is an international expression of confidence in the strength of Israeli society, in our political stability, and in the economic policy we are leading. The Israeli stock exchange has provided some of the highest returns in the world, thus proving that despite the war - the future here is bright. Investors understand better than politicians and commentators and they believe in Israel and the fast future that awaits it. And they are right.. The Chairman of the Israel Securities Authority, Seffy Zinger, said that "one of the main factors for the strength of the Israeli capital market is its deep integration with global markets, and especially with the American capital market. The financial ties between us are deep and strong." Zinger recounted a recent meeting in the US with American investors: "What particularly caught their attention was the performance of the Israeli stock exchange compared to global markets. The Tel Aviv-125 index yielded a return of almost 30% in 2024, almost as much as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq indices. This is an especially impressive achievement, given the fact that it took place during the most difficult and complex war in Israel's history. I told those investors: Don't invest in Israel just out of love. Invest in it because it's a good investment." In addition to Smotrich and Zinger, the event was attended by other heads of the economy, including Bank of Israel Governor Prof. Amir Yaron, Finance Ministry Director General Ilan Rom, Israel Stock Exchange Director General Itai Ben Ze'ev, Competition Authority Director Michal Cohen, Capital Market Authority Commissioner Amit Gal, Bank Leumi CEO Hanan Friedman, Phoenix CEO Eyal Ben Simon, Zvi Stepak, co-owner of the investment house Meitav-Dash, BlackRock Israel CEO Anat Levin, venture capitalist Michael Eisenberg, co-founder of the Aleph Fund, businessman Gideon Tadmor, Bank of Jerusalem CEO Yair Kaplan, and former minister and venture capitalist Yizhar Shai, whose son Yaron Shai fell on October 7, and who decided to leverage the pain to establish 1,500 startups to commemorate those murdered and fallen on October 7 and in the Swords of Iron War. Minister Smotrich said that he came to the event from Mount Herzl, where Yosef Yehuda Chirak, who fell yesterday in Gaza, was laid to rest. He said that Huckabee and he met just two days ago with Yehuda Eliyahu, head of the Settlement Directorate at the Defense Ministry, and Chirak’s father-in-law.

Title: BlackRock’s IBIT becomes second-largest Bitcoin holder behind Satoshi Nakamoto

BlackRock's IBIT poised to potentially overtake Satoshi Nakamoto's Bitcoin holdings by next summer. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has become the second-largest holder of Bitcoin as of May 20, surpassed only by the infamous wallet of Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of the flagship crypto. According to data compiled by crypto analyst Shaun Edmondson, IBIT currently holds 636,108 BTC, representing over 3% of Bitcoin’s total capped supply of 21 million and nearly 57% of Nakamoto’s estimated 1.12 million BTC stash. With this, BlackRock now holds more Bitcoin than Binance, the largest crypto exchange by trading volume, and Strategy, the largest corporate holder of the bellwether asset. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas suggested that, depending on how Bitcoin performs in the market, the ETF’s Bitcoin holdings could overtake Satoshi’s by next summer. He added that the timeline could accelerate if the asset’s price approaches $150,000. He said such a surge might prompt widespread institutional demand, particularly from financial advisors reallocating client assets into Bitcoin exposure. Since its launch in January 2024, IBIT has become a dominant player in the Bitcoin ETF space. The fund has consistently outpaced other ETFs in inflows and asset growth, including traditional vehicles such as gold ETFs. Its rise has been fueled by growing demand from institutions and retail investors seeking regulated exposure to Bitcoin. According to data from Sosovalue, BlackRock’s IBIT held $66.9 billion in net assets as of May 19, making it the largest Bitcoin ETF by value. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential. He imparts insights on a range of topics like DeFi, hacks, mining and culture, underlining transformative power.

Title: The Significance of Jamie Dimon’s Reluctant Bitcoin Surrender
URL: https://time.com/7287164/jpmorgan-chase-bitcoin-jamie-dimon/
Time Published: 2025-05-20T18:55:24Z
Full Content:
Correspondent JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon at the Global Markets Conference in Paris on May 15, 2025. Correspondent JPMorgan Chase’s CEO Jamie Dimon has long been one of Bitcoin’s most vicious skeptics. In 2017, he said he would fire any employee who traded Bitcoin for being “stupid,” and called it a “fraud.” Last year, he called the cryptocurrency a “pet rock.” But this week, Dimon announced that JPMorgan Chase would allow its clients to buy Bitcoin. He said it with a grimace on his face, speaking at JPMorgan Chase’s investor day, and rattled off a list of criticisms shared by other Bitcoin cynics, including that the currency facilitated sex trafficking and terrorism. But he conceded that his clients could do what they wished with their money. “I don’t think you should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke. I defend your right to buy Bitcoin. Go at it.” Advertisement Advertisement The decision marks a significant symbolic and practical victory for the Bitcoin community, which, despite its anti-establishment beginnings, has sought institutional acceptance. Dimon, a heavyweight of traditional finance, has consistently used his perch to discourage regular investors and other financial leaders from getting involved. But he has also often been called a pragmatist—and his shift on Bitcoin reflects a changed political climate and mounting client demand. Read More: Why Trump’s Meme Coins Have Alarmed Both Crypto Insiders and Legal Experts Dimon’s decision arises from a year of mounting competition and interest in Bitcoin from other large firms. The entwining of Bitcoin and traditional finance kicked off in January 2024, when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission reluctantly gave the green light for Bitcoin ETFs—investment vehicles which allow people to bet on Bitcoin’s price without actually holding it—to enter the market. Billions of dollars immediately flowed into these ETFs, proving their value to major financial institutions like BlackRock. That summer, Morgan Stanley allowed its wealth advisors to sell Bitcoin ETFs to clients, and Goldman Sachs purchased $418 million worth of them. Then, Donald Trump won the presidency, sending crypto hype into overdrive. On the campaign trail, Trump won over many crypto fans for accusing Biden of choking off the industry. Trump then pledged to make the U.S. the “Bitcoin capital of the world.” Since his election, Trump has thrown both his government influence and personal brand behind cryptocurrency efforts. And the banking sector has been significantly impacted. In his first week in office, Trump repealed SAB 121, a Biden-era accounting rule which discouraged banks from handling crypto assets. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency then rescinded their anti-crypto guidance, leaving much greater discretion to the banks on how to deal with digital assets. Many banks jumped in. Goldman Sachs amassed a stockpile of over $1 billion worth of Bitcoin ETFs. The CEOs of Bank of America and Morgan Stanley both expressed interest in offering crypto products. Dimon could have stuck to his guns and kept JPMorgan out of it. But the bank—which is the biggest in America, with over $3 trillion in assets worldwide— risked losing high-net-worth individuals and institutional clients seeking to diversify their portfolios at a moment of extreme financial volatility. So now, JPMorgan customers will be allowed to buy Bitcoin, he said on Monday. He added, however, that the bank would not custody Bitcoin, necessitating a trusted third party. Dimon’s decision could bring about further change. His capitulation could serve as a powerful signal to other holdouts in traditional finance. And JPMorgan’s massive customer base could bring in a new wave of Bitcoin investors. Crypto Twitter, unsurprisingly, gleefully celebrated his about-face. “Jamie Dimon has bent the knee,” Cory Klippsten, the CEO of Swan, wrote on Twitter. © 2025 TIME USA, LLC. All Rights Reserved.

Title: 3 Terrible Companies To Lose $5 Billion in Federal Green Energy Loans

Energy & Environment Jeff Luse | 5.20.2025 1:37 PM In the last days of the Biden administration, the Energy Department dolled out billions of dollars for politically favored green energy projects. The Trump administration is looking to claw this funding back. The Energy Department is getting ready to "cancel seven major loans and loan guarantees that had been conditionally approved under the Biden administration," reports Semafor. This action will cancel approximately $5 billion worth of funding for a transmission project by a New Jersey utility company, a loan program for low-income homeowners to install rooftop solar panels by Sunnova, and a Monolith Nebraska factory to produce low-carbon ammonia. The remaining four projects, which collectively received over $3 billion, include three battery factories and a plastics and recycling facility, which "were already previously cancelled by their companies because of other various headwinds," according to Semafor. The three active projects that will have their federal loans axed have faced their own share of problems. In September 2023, Sunnova received a $3 billion partial loan guarantee from the Energy Department's Loan Programs Office (LPO) for Project Hestia—a program that would make residential rooftop solar, battery storage, and virtual power plants "available to more American homeowners." Hestia was expected to provide loans to as many as 115,000 homeowners in the United States and Puerto Rico for these technologies, while creating "3,400 good-paying, high-quality American jobs." After receiving the federal loan, Sunnova came under fire for its alleged history of predatory practices and scamming elderly clients, which led to subsequent congressional scrutiny. In April, Sunnova began filing for bankruptcy. The company recently said it was no longer planning to use the programming funding and was working with the Energy Department to return the remaining guarantees. Monolith received a $953 million conditional loan guarantee from the LPO to accelerate its clean hydrogen and carbon utilization project in Nebraska. The company, which has received backing from BlackRock and NextEra Energy and was valued at over $1 billion in 2022, creates hydrogen fuel with renewable energy (which can be used to make ammonia in fertilizers) and carbon black. Despite the federal funding and private sector support, The Wall Street Journal reported in September 2024 that the company was "running short on cash and facing project delays." The third project facing the ax is New Jersey's Clean Energy Corridor, "a project to upgrade and expand transmission infrastructure to accommodate planned generation in New Jersey to meet growing electricity demand." Run by Jersey Central Power & Light Company, the project received a conditional loan guarantee of up to $716 million in January to support the state's goal of "introducing 11,000 MW of offshore wind-generated electricity by 2035." When First Energy, which owns Jersey Central, first announced the project in 2022, Danish energy company Orsted was planning two large wind projects off New Jersey's coast. The projects were canceled in 2023. Another New Jersey offshore wind project was recently halted after the Environmental Protection Agency rescinded the project's environmental permits. Despite these project cancellations and the LPO's history of questionable and risky investments, it does not appear that the office is going away soon; Energy Secretary Chris Wright recently told lawmakers that his agency would use the LPO to advance nuclear energy projects. Assuming Wright fully cuts billions of dollars worth of wasteful projects and narrows the agency's scope to only fund nuclear power projects, it's possible that the LPO's budget—which ballooned to over $400 billion under the Biden administration—could meaningfully shrink. Still, a meaningfully reduced budget is not enough. With the national deficit climbing to over $28 trillion in debt held by the public, taxpayers can no longer afford to support the federal government's fantasy that it should be a green bank.

ByJennifer Jacobs Dungs ByJennifer Jacobs Dungs, Contributor. The modern black sports car ,3d ,render. Yet arguably, it is being disrupted but not from these players. But we will get to that later. The automotive industry is complex, capital-intensive, and highly competitive. It has been a long road to get where we are today. Ford was one of the first automakers in the USA to be formed in 1903, when 12 investors raised $28,000. In Europe, Daimler was formed around the same time in 1890 and sold the first contemporary automobiles, the Mercedes, in 1901. Since then, the Big Three, General Motors, Stellantis (formerly Chrysler), and Ford Motor Company have long dominated as the American car companies. In Germany, the Big Three have been Volkswagen, Daimler and BMW. A lot can be said about the positive progress and impact these companies have had on the GDP, job creation, and innovation. But when comparing this to the progress in market capitalization, there is a disconnect. The new kids on the block Shanghai,China-April 3rd 2024: Chinese customers at Xiaomi ev store test SU7 electric car Today the market cap for the USA ‘Big Three’ companies summed together is roughly $112 billion and for the German ‘Big Three’ it is $140 billion. This pales in comparison to the not-so-new newcomer (founded in 2003), Tesla, which has a market cap larger than all of those 6 companies combined, at ~$800 billion (even with the recent turmoil). And has survived the valley of death around ‘scaling’ and impressively sold ~1.8 million vehicles in 2023 (of the 17M global EVs sold). BYD was founded in 1995 and designed and sold their first car in 2005. This, similar to Tesla, is nearly 100 years after the first car companies in Michigan and Germany were formed! Yet, BYD has a market cap of ~$107B, equivalent to more than 2 of the 3 ‘Big Three’ in the USA or Germany. Xiaomi was founded even later, in 2010, focused on smartphone devices, and only in 2021 was Xiaomi automobile founded. They recently just reached their 100,000th unit of their first production vehicle, the SU7. This pales in comparison to the production numbers at Volkswagen, where ~9M vehicles were produced in 2024. Yet Xiaomi has a market cap of nearly 3x that of Volkswagen. Surviving the valley of death How have these new kids on the block survived and apparently thrived, when so many others have not. Starting from the beginning, starting a new automotive OEM is monumental and requires billions – up to $1 billion alone for the vehicle R&D. Production of a new vehicle can cost between $1 billion and $5 billion (e.g., one capable of producing 20,000+ cars annually), tooling can add another $1 billion. This is all before the supply chain, sales and marketing, and working capital. To put it in perspective, new full-scale OEMs would need to raise $10-$20 billion to just join a ticket to the party. And surprisingly – or maybe not so, Tesla did exactly that. It did not hurt that Elon Musk was able to personally invest, he contributed $70 million since 2004 and this helped keep the company afloat during critical times such as the 2008 financial crisis. Turns out this was a good investment, as in November 2024, the shares of Tesla soared again reaching $1 trillion (valued more than Toyota, Ferrari, Porsche, GM, and Ford combined) and continued to increase until January, 2025 – but due to several months of turmoil it has fallen ~32%. And there is uncertainty about the future. Unicorn failure GENEVA, SWITZERLAND - FEBRUARY 26: A Lucid Air Pure fully electric EV car is displayed during the ...

This year’s Show will be a smaller affair with just four major manufacturers confirmed to attend. (Photo by John Keeble/Getty Images) There have been other companies successful in fundraising ~$1 billion, but their success has not followed the same path. Arrival, the British electric vehicle startup, raised over $1.3 billion during its development and was valued at $13 billion before going into bankruptcy. And this all happened before delivering a single electric van. Rivian raised a $1.3 billion round led by T. Rowe Price in 2019 and a $2.5 billion round in 2020, with major backers such as Amazon, Ford, and BlackRock. In total, Rivian raised over $10 billion prior to its IPO in 2021. It has a market cap of ~$13 billion. Recently, it created a joint venture with Volkswagen Group combined with a total investment of $5.8 billion. But in 2024, Rivian sold only ~51,600 vehicles. Lucid raised over $1 billion from Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) in 2018, and more recently another $1.75 billion to secure runway for 2025. It has a market cap of ~$7 billion. Yet again in 2024, it sold only ~10,241 vehicles. Adding contrast again, GM sold ~6 million vehicles in 2024 worldwide and in their peak sold 10 million in 2016. It is safe to say that these newcomer OEMs are still in the scaling phase. And there are several other newcomer OEMs who have recently had a stop in the road, filing bankruptcy or are shortly before doing so. This includes companies like Faraday Future, which raised $2 billion since its founding in 2014. It has not formally declared bankruptcy but has consistently struggled with funding shortages and scaling production. Fisker Inc. raised significant funds, including through a SPAC merger in 2020 that brought in approximately $1 billion, but was not able to scale. There are other players such as Canoo, Lordstown Motors and Electric Last Mile Solutions, all raising significant cash – but somehow not enough to survive “the death valley curve”. According to Joan Magretta, award-winning contributor to the Harvard Business Review and author, it could be as simple as ensuring the growth ambitions align with the right business model. This makes a lot of sense as the growth ambitions help secure the initial VC funding with a compelling vision and narrative, which led to many companies reaching unicorn status with valuations exceeding $1 billion. But often the start-up underestimates the costs associated with the challenges of scaling an OEM and eventually just runs out of cash. This is the nut that needs to be cracked. Being the fast fish is key to success LEIPZIG, GERMANY - MAY 6: Workers assemble the new all electric Porsche Macan at the Porsche ... More assembly plant on May 6, 2024 in Leipzig, Germany. The electric Macan is Porsche's second electric car after the Taycan. The company also offers two hybrid cars. (Photo by Jens Schlueter/Getty Images) But there is immense value in helping to ensure that new players do not just come on to the field, but stay to play, and disrupt – as they can help push the boundaries of innovation as shown in the software race and how Chinese newcomers are revolutionizing the customer experience. They can accelerate sustainability as shown with Tesla, which doubled down on an all-electric fleet from day 1. And can increase competition and consumer choice. Mobility is the backbone of economic growth, social connectivity, and sustainable development. It ties together commerce, urbanization, and technology. And this is true both in Europe and the USA with it representing about 14 million jobs and ~7% of the GDP and 10 million jobs and ~3% of GDP, respectively. In order to stay competitive, the Western incumbents have started considering to join forces with the newcomers (as shown with VW Group and Rivian). But this alone will likely not be enough. For newcomers to establish themselves and achieve commercial viability, they need a supportive ecosystem that fosters growth. Access to venture capital funding, state grants, loans, and tax incentives can provide the necessary financial boost. Beyond financial backing, technical expertise is critical. New OEMs must leverage experienced development and manufacturing partners to properly implement their innovations, scale production efficiently and take off into the right direction. Strategic investments from industrial players and tech giants can offer private growth capital that ensures long-term sustainability. It was nearly 10 years ago but couldn’t be more true today as stated by Klaus Schwab, WEF, “… it is not the big fish which eats the small fish, it’s the fast fish which eats the slow fish.” And in the automotive industry, it is time to do what cars do best - speed up!

Title: Irish Life, Amundi and BlackRock picked to run Ireland’s auto enrolment pot

Irish Life Investment Managers (ILIM), Amundi and BlackRock have been selected to manage assets in the State’s incoming automatic-enrolment pension scheme. It is expected these companies will complete contract negotiations this summer, well in advance of the commencement of the auto-enrolment regime, known as My Future Fund, in January, the Department of Social Protection said in a statement on Tuesday. ILIM had €131 billion of assets under management (AUM) at the end of last year. Amundi is Europe’s largest asset manager, with €2.24 trillion of AUM in December, while BlackRock is the world’s largest, with $11.6 trillion. Amundi has a significant presence in Ireland, with about 380 employees, stemming from its 2017 purchase of Dublin-based Pioneer Investments in 2017. BlackRock opened an office in Dublin, home to one of the world’s largest funds hubs, in 2011, and has subsequently grown its headcount to more than 140 employees. [ Looming launch of auto-enrolment pensions means no honeymoon for incoming ministerOpens in new window ] “My Future Fund is a transformative initiative that will revolutionise how people save for their retirement,” said Minister for Social Protection Dara Calleary. “This is a landmark policy and these investment management companies, who have been selected after a competitive procurement process, will play a huge role in ensuring that My Future Fund is a success and represents good value for money for all future participants.” The Department of Social Protection has in recent weeks launched a search for a chief executive of the National Automatic Enrolment Retirement Savings Authority (Naersa), which will oversee the administration of the AE scheme. AE will capture about 800,000 workers in the State that are not currently part of a pension plan. The appointee to the €215,000-a-year role will be expected to “bring vision, strategic leadership and effective management across all the functions of the Naersa in order to ensure that it discharges its functions efficiently and effectively to the benefit of its estimated 800,000 participants and Irish society more generally,” according to an information booklet for candidates. May 29th has been set as the closing date for applications. The AE scheme is expected it will hold more than €20 billion of assets on behalf of beneficiaries within 10 years, rising potentially to more than €300 billion over 30-40 years, according to the booklet. First proposed by then government Fianna Fáil minister Séamus Brennan in 2006, AE has been through years of delays and false dawns. However, enabling legislation was finally enacted last July and Indian group Tata Consultancy Services was signed up in October to build and run the AE system. The department is in the middle of procuring three investment managers to handle the assets in the fund. Under the terms of the Irish scheme, which applies to workers aged between 23 and 60 who earn at least €20,000 per annum across one or more jobs, employers and employees will each initially contribute 1.5 per cent of gross earnings to their pension pot, with the government adding a further 0.5 per cent. The contributions are due to increase in stages over 10 years, reaching 6 per cent, 6 per cent and 2 per cent, respectively.

Title: From Dublin bank official to medal-winning gardener at Chelsea: Billy Alexander on turning his side hustle to gold

Billy Alexander of Co Kerry-based Kells Bay House and Gardens knows what it’s like to go from boom to bust to bloom. The former assistant bank manager at AIB was awarded a gold medal for his fern collection at the Chelsea Flower Show, for decades of work with ferns. It his not his first Chelsea rodeo. This is his fourth medal at “the pinnacle of horticulture”, as he puts it. In 2018 he won silver gilt, followed in 2021 by gold for his display of ferns. In 2023, he won gold again, along with Best in Show. “Every rodeo gets better,” he says as he’s interviewed over the phone while selling a €30 specimen to a customer from his Chelsea stand. He’s got a cool head on his shoulders. But rewind more than 20 years ago and the Blackrock, Co Dublin native and former banker used to cycle home from his day job as a banking clerk at AIB bank centre to his house in Leopardstown, where he spent his evenings on his knees becoming a “compulsive gardener”. Tree ferns are his thing. He was first introduced to the plant type by Aunt Cora, a friend of his mother’s who, before she died in her early 50s, became like “a surrogate mother” to the then 20-something. “She bought me a tree fern, a Dicksonia antarctica”. The passion prompted him to start a hobby business selling plants, while not yet giving up on the day job. Alexander encountered Kells Bay for the first time when he drove southwest to deliver some plants to its former owners. The 19th-century hunting lodge overlooks the Iveragh Peninsula and is set on 60 acres of historic subtropical garden. “It was a nirvana of plants,” he recalls. The tree fern forest that sealed the deal. Home to an extraordinary collection of naturalised tree ferns, its oldest specimen of Dicksonia antarctica – known as the garden’s “mother tree fern”, is believed to have single-handedly spored the hundreds of others that now flourish in the protected microclimate of Kells Bay’s primeval forest. Leveraging his three-bed semi in Leopardstown and three apartments he owned, he made an offer of €2 million on the property, first directly to the owners and then through their agent. About a year later they came back to say that they’d accept it, but by then he didn’t have the money. “I don’t have €2 million, but I can give you €1.5 million, he recalls saying. It was accepted. This was 2006. “It wasn’t easy, but it was possible – but impossible now,” he says. After the boom came the bust. He had to deal with vulture funds, but “little by little the dream got better”, he says. [ Best in show: Irish dahlia growers compete in the UKOpens in new window ] He and his wife Penn now work the property together. She’s from Thailand and the resident chef, and B&B costs about €140 to €150 per person. They’re travelling to her native country in October and will visit the area that borders China to see scheffleras, tropical evergreen shrubs, in the wild. Also in his travel plans is a research trip to Uganda to see Lobelia that is native to the Mountains of the Moon Massif. Alexander has also visited Highgrove House, family residence of King Charles III and Queen Camilla, several times. He had his daughter Aisling with him on the stand when the king presented him with his medal. Even the logistics of the Chelsea show are an enormous undertaking. His stand, in the Grand Pavilion, is 120sq m in size and features more than 100 different species of ferns. Every plant in it was lovingly transported to the London showgrounds by Hutton Transport last week, in a 40-foot temperature-controlled truck. Alexander set the temperature to eight degrees Celsius, to “put the plants to sleep” for the 48-hour journey. He selected 26 of the 50 specimens he grew to be able to make those choices, having nurtured them for two years in advance of this May event. “You need to be able to do quality control, so you need twice the amount,” he explains. He will sell some of his stock, but much of it will make the return journey to west Kerry. And how much does it cost to stage such a show? “It’s sort of like the Olympics,” he says. “They give you a small stipend for your expenses.” The stipend amounts to about £300 (€356). But the actual cost of exhibiting comes close to about €50,000. Alexander’s stand has been sponsored by Wilde Aparthotels.

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. With Bitcoin (BTC) surging back above the $105,000 mark and nearing its record high set in January, market expert Doctor Profit has outlined bullish predictions for the leading cryptocurrency. In a recent post on social media platform X, he detailed the dynamics he believes will drive Bitcoin toward new highs. Since hitting $77,000, Doctor Profit identified $100,000 as the first significant target, which has now been achieved. Looking ahead, he sees the next breakout target between $116,000 and $120,000. His confidence stems from several positive indicators, including a strong bullish divergence observed on the daily chart—a technical signal often associated with forthcoming price increases. He emphasized that daily divergences tend to have a higher success rate than those seen on longer time frames. Additionally, Doctor Profit pointed out that the funding rate is currently stable, with no over-leveraged positions in the market. He noted that BTC recently broke out of a significant double bottom formation and is now testing previous highs. A critical factor in his outlook is the substantial accumulation by US exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which are reportedly purchasing Bitcoin at a rate eight times greater than its current mining output. This aggressive accumulation phase, according to Doctor Profit, indicates institutional interest remains robust, even as retail traders have largely stayed on the sidelines during recent volatility. The analyst also highlighted that the strongest retail buying occurred around the $90,000 mark, which also represents a liquidity hotspot. Should the market revisit this level, he sees it as an optimal entry point, perfectly positioned at the bottom of the established trading box. Looking ahead, Doctor Profit anticipates volatility, particularly in light of Moody’s recent downgrade of the US credit rating from AAA to AA1—the first major downgrade since S&P’s similar action in 2011. Historical context suggests that such downgrades can lead to swift market corrections. In August 2011, following a downgrade, markets dropped by 5.5% in a single day. Doctor Profit believes that Bitcoin could similarly dip into the $90,000 range to capture liquidity before rebounding. Despite potential short-term fluctuations due to the downgrade, Doctor Profit maintains a bullish outlook for Bitcoin, reiterating his target of $116,000 to $120,000. He noted that the market had largely priced in the downgrade, and historically, stocks have rallied following such events. With major institutions, including BlackRock, increasing their Bitcoin purchases in the exchange-traded fund arena, Doctor Profit sees no signs of weakness in the market, pointing to further price gains for the market’s leading cryptocurrency. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $105,400, marking a 12% increase over the past two weeks and a nearly 24% increase over the past month. Year-to-date, the cryptocurrency has gained 60%, lagging behind XRP’s gains of over 300% in the same period.

Title: Monzo’s pivot from cool to corporate: ‘freshness is not about gimmicks’

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Monzo, Britain’s biggest digital bank, is still synonymous with its neon debit cards, extensive use of emojis, and free spending abroad. But it’s no longer just trying to be cool; it’s trying to become a major financial institution. That shift, from an upstart fintech beloved by millennials to a mature, sustainable business, is what makes this year a likely turning point. In a sit-down with this editor last week — despite signs that Monzo is preparing to go public, along with new reports that something is in the works — Monzo CEO TS Anil wouldn’t confirm that Monzo is listing this year. He suggested the building blocks are in place, though: profitability, product breadth, and just the right amount of AI. The numbers help tell the story. Monzo posted its first annual profit last year. In its 2024 annual report, it claimed 9.3 million personal account holders and more than 400,000 business customers. It’s also no longer reliant on interchange fees and overdrafts; lending, subscriptions, and business banking are now meaningful revenue streams. All this comes after a period marked by regulatory scrutiny and leadership turnover, developments that forced the company to grow up fast. Under Anil — a banking veteran who joined Monzo in 2020 and soon after took over as CEO from co-founder Tom Blomfield — Monzo is still flashy. Those hot coral cards remain a must for many younger banking customers. It has also become more disciplined about its growing product lineup. Monzo’s customers can now invest in mutual funds powered by BlackRock, for example, and track their existing mortgages from other lenders in their Monzo app. They can also use Monzo in the U.S., though most Americans have yet to hear of the brand. The question is whether that’s a problem, considering Monzo started amassing beta customers in the country six years ago. Certainly, it seemed fair to ask if Monzo needs to penetrate the U.S. market to become the global powerhouse that Anil is envisioning. During our sit-down, Anil suggested that’s not the case. He said that one in five adults in the U.K. now banks with Monzo — in other words, there is market share Monzo has left to gain in its own backyard. (According to Anil, Monzo added 300,000 new users in April alone.) When questioned about U.S. expansion and the competitive landscape, Anil downplayed the challenge. “I think there are a few universal truths that apply,” he said. “Most people feel anxiety about their money, and that anxiety is independent of affluence … The second thing that holds true is that the incumbent industry has been built off of arbitraging customers and leveraging, in some fashion, customers’ ignorance. Those are the insights that are helping us create the best features that would make sense in the U.S.; that’s the way we intend to double down.” During our talk, we also discussed whether Monzo could itself be construed as a legacy player in the not-too-distant future. After all, the company is now 10 years old, and AI is changing everything. We wanted to know whether Monzo worries about the rise of AI-native banks. “Gosh no, we’re not a legacy player,” Anil said. “We continue to operate at the bleeding edge of technology.” What would worry him, he continued, is if he “saw signs of complacency in terms of adopting new technology, or at least a curiosity about it. Those would be like bright, flashing red warning signs for me, but that’s the opposite of the company that we are.” As for the IPO that’s reportedly in the works, Anil said: “To tell someone in the media ‘don’t believe everything you read in the media’ is kind of like a dicey move to make, but yeah, please don’t believe everything you read in the press. We will be a great public company one day. We haven’t decided either when or where, let alone with whom.” If you’re curious to learn more, including about how Monzo keeps its marketing fresh, how it’s using AI, and the ways its engineers handle the adoption of new tech, watch our full chat below.

Title: Eamon Ryan: Why has it taken so long to develop a greenway for Dublin Bay?

For more than 30 years, people have been campaigning for a safe walking and cycling route around Dublin Bay. It could transform our city, connecting northside and southside and restore the environment I grew up in, where children were much more free to wander and explore. It has been championed by many organisations and has a variety of names: the Sutton to Sandycove cycleway, the Coastal Trail or Dublin Bay Greenway. But its history tells a sad story of a lack of political will that is stopping us from fulfilling the true potential of our city. I remember in the mid 1990s heading out to Bull Island on a protest cycle organised by the Dublin Cycling Campaign. We were full of hope, only to be frustrated when a local resident opposing the plans had the ear of an influential councillor, and progress was delayed for years. Now the northside section is introduced, I don’t think a single person would want us to go back. Around the same time, we argued with Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council to compulsory purchase a sliver of land beside Blackrock Dart station to remove one of the worst bottlenecks on the route. We were told it would take too long, and asked to be patient and allow an alternative approach to see the light of day. We are still waiting for that to this day. Fifteen years ago, things changed for the better when, despite budgetary hard times, money was allocated for the first proper greenway between Newport and Achill. It was built quickly and at low cost because local people wanted their children to be able to meet their neighbours without having to navigate the dangerous main road. A few years later, the 46km Waterford greenway became a similar success story and every council started to consider what might be possible. Under the last government, they were allocated the staff and funding to develop their plans. Transport Infrastructure Ireland was given the responsibility of connecting up a national greenway network, and the National Transport Authority had the key role of approving projects and allocating budgets. Their orders were to prioritise local needs, deliver at speed and avoid over-engineering solutions in order to keep costs down. During Covid, the best example came when the mix of a visionary community group, an enthusiastic council and a great local authority official built out the coastal cycle route between Blackrock and Sandycove. They did it in record time and at minimal cost, transforming Dún Laoghaire for the better. It would make you cry. Half a century to deliver a three-metre track along the 22km it takes to get around the bay However, things fell back again when Dublin City Council tried to emulate the same approach in Sandymount, only for the High Court to stop the trial. What made it worse was the chilling effect the decision had in every council across the country and that it took four years for the Court of Appeal to reverse the judicial decision in April. At last, it seemed that the Strand Road section was ready to be built. With Dublin Port also promising a safe route from Clontarf to the East link bridge by next year, an end-to-end Dublin Bay Greenway finally seemed to be at hand. However during the interim period, some Dublin City Councillors appear to have lost their nerve. They and some residents are arguing we should await the introduction of flood protection works before building the cycle path, which will likely delay things for another 20 years. It would make you cry. Half a century to deliver a three-metre track along the 22km it takes to get around the bay – and all that delay because our political system is so attentive to local opposition, while the silent majority opinion that wants change remains by its very nature unheard. Public officials and regulators read the political temperature in a similar way and hold back on making hard decisions. Whatever you do, do nothing, becomes the order of the day. But what happened in Dún Laoghaire shows what is possible. The Dublin authorities are starting to deliver other game changing pathfinder projects and slowly but surely are improving things along the canals, Liffey, Tolka and Dodder. By joining up these various initiatives, we can reach a tipping point where Dublin once again becomes a great city to cycle and walk around and the perfect place to raise a child and call your home. Recent developments in Limerick, where a cycleway will connect the three universities, and on the Waterford Quay – where a sustainable transport bridge is about to be installed, which will link the existing greenway to the Waterford to New Ross greenway – give similar cause for hope. But you cannot force local authorities to make the necessary decisions. However, greater targeting of the active travel budget can change political dynamics. Those councils willing to build with ambition, speed and low-cost solutions should get most of the funding. Those who don’t should be asked to come up with more ambitious greenway plans and a plan to make it happen quickly. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

PR TIMESのご利用について 資料をダウンロード BounceBit Ltd CeDeFiインフラストラクチャ・プラットフォームであるBounceBitは、BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund（BUIDL）を活用した初の構造化利回り戦略を成功裏に実行し、リアルワールド資産（RWA）の暗号資産金融への統合において新たなマイルストーンを打ち立てました。本戦略はBounceBitのトレジャリー管理フレームワークを強化すると同時に、今後リリース予定の製品群「BB Prime」の概念実証として機能します。 このRWA資産を基盤とした初の構造化投資商品では、BUIDL を革新的に活用しています。BUIDL は、BlackRock が運用し総資産20億ドル超を誇るトークン化された短期米国債ファンドです。適格デジタル証券プラットフォームである Securitize を通じてトークン化され、SEC（米国証券取引委員会）規制下のブローカー・ディーラーである Securitize Markets, LLC によって販売されています。投資家は法規制を遵守しながら、ドル建ての利回りを得ることが可能です。 この戦略の中核を担うのが、BUIDL を担保に用いて実行する3カ月間のデルタニュートラル・アービトラージ戦略（BTC先物のベーシス取引とオプション取引）です。本商品の構造では、アービトラージによる年率約20％の利回りと、BUIDL が本来持つ約4.25％の米国債利回りを組み合わせることで、合計で最大約24％の実効APY（年利換算利回り）を実現します。従来のステーブルコイン担保型戦略と比較して、基礎担保の資本効率が大幅に改善される点が大きな特徴です。 本戦略では、以下の点を可能にする新しいアーキテクチャを採用しています。 積み重なる利回りの獲得：米国債とアービトラージ双方のリターンを組み合わせながら、どちらも損なわない設計 機関投資家レベルのリスクモデル：資本効率を最適化 スマートコントラクトの自動化：運用の透明性とオペレーションの完全性を担保 「これにより、従来の金融市場から得られる利回りと暗号資産におけるアービトラージの収益を同時に享受できる初めての機会が生まれました」と、BounceBitの創業者兼CEOであるジャック・ルー（Jack Lu）は述べています。「世界的に著名な資産運用会社と協業することで、CeDeFiインフラによるRWAの活用方法を再構築し、西側基準の資産とアジアのダイナミックなトレーディング環境を結びつけることを目指しています。」 この戦略が成功を収めた背景には、BlackRock が提供する高品質の基盤資産と、Securitize による堅固なコンプライアンス体制があります。BounceBit の CeDeFi スタックは、カストディアンとトレーディング・プラットフォーム間での資産移転をスムーズに実行できるよう設計されています。 今後ローンチ予定の「BounceBit Prime」プラットフォームは、RWA を基盤とした統合型の利回りソリューションの提供を専業で行う初のプラットフォームになります。流動性の制限や実需の乏しさなど、RWA 分野が抱える主要な課題に対応することを目指しています。BlackRock の BUIDL や Franklin Templeton の Benji Fund などが初期のラインアップとして予定されており、450Mドル超のCeDeFiエコシステムによって支えられる BounceBit Prime は、機関投資家や暗号資産ネイティブ投資家に対して透明性と高効率の利回り商品を提供する計画です。ローンチに関する詳細は、近く発表される予定です。 BounceBit についてBounceBit は、CeDeFi（中央集権型と分散型を融合した金融）の中核インフラ構築に取り組んでいます。機関投資家向けの利回り商品、リステーキング・アプリケーション、RWA（リアルワールド資産）統合を提供します。BounceBit Chain は、Bitcoin（BTC）と独自トークン $BB によるデュアルトークン型 PoS Layer1 で運営されており、ビットコイン並みの高いセキュリティとEVM（Ethereum Virtual Machine）との完全互換性を兼ね備えています。 Website : https://www.bouncebit.io/ X (旧Twitter) : https://x.com/bounce_bit すべての画像 このプレスリリース内で使われている画像ファイルがダウンロードできます 0フォロワー Copyright © PR TIMES Corporation All Rights Reserved.

Title: The Perils of Founder Worship
URL: https://clsbluesky.law.columbia.edu/2025/05/20/the-perils-of-founder-worship/
Time Published: 2025-05-20T04:05:46Z
Full Content:
In the world of startups, founders are often elevated to near mythical status – the force poised to disrupt entire industries. This adulation can grant founders extraordinary latitude in corporate control, especially in innovative and unregulated sectors like tech or crypto. However, when this reverence turns into “founder worship,” especially under the guise of doing good, it blinds investors and stakeholders to the absence of basic corporate governance. The consequences can be disastrous. The rise and fall of FTX and its founder Sam Bankman-Fried (“SBF”) offer a cautionary tale – one where charisma, weak governance, and the veneer of altruism obscured its lack of corporate discipline. It is a stark illustration of what can happen when governance norms are subordinated to a visionary founder. At the heart of the FTX scandal lies a troubling paradox: The “do-gooderism” that made SBF a household name and the darling of the venture capital world also amplified founder exceptionalism and deferred governance in the name of innovation. In essence, FTX highlights the dangerous interplay between founder worship and a specific kind of moral narrative that led to a company operating without fundamental corporate safeguards and meaningful checks on the founder’s authority. The rise of effective altruism (“EA”), a philosophical and social movement that emphasizes evidence-based philanthropy and the strategic use of wealth to maximize social good, permeates elite universities and the tech ecosystem. SBF’s association with EA lent him credibility and moral capital, particularly among sophisticated investors like Sequoia Capital, BlackRock, and Thoma Bravo LP. In theory, EA is aligned with ethical principles – encouraging rich individuals to donate substantial portions of their income to causes that yield the greatest impact. The reality, however, was that EA served as a moral halo for SBF, evidence of his integrity and commitment to the greater good. SBF’s disheveled appearance reinforced the impression that he was intensely focused on building the first one trillion-dollar startup solely for EA goals. This impression created trust in SBF, which substituted for governance. FTX’s legitimacy was bolstered not by its compliance with best practices but by its founder’s supposed noblesse oblige, which was based on his commitment to EA. Venture capital-backed startups operate in a unique legal environment where private ordering allows early-stage companies to structure governance, allocate rights, and implement oversight according to their own preferences. The flexibility accorded to private companies contrasts with the discipline expected of public companies, where ownership and control are clearly separated and heavily regulated. In many ways, this flexibility allows startups to move fast, take risks, and innovate. Over time, oversight mechanisms such as investor board seats, staged financings, and protective provisions typically create checks. However, when a founder commands cultural and financial capital, as did SBF, these checks may be non-existent. Enamored by mission-driven founders, investors sometimes abdicate their responsibility to control and manage the startups through the board of directors and to vote on corporate policies. The promise of massive returns can distract the most seasoned venture capitalists to the extent that they ignore red flags. By deferring or waiving such checks, a company whose corporate governance is based on private ordering can falter or even collapse. In the case of FTX, a founder-centric structure, coupled with mythical “do gooderism,” became a shield against scrutiny and ultimately led to the company’s demise and SBF’s criminal conviction. FTX was not subject to even the most basic corporate controls. Financial audits, effective board oversight, and internal compliance mechanisms were absent. Investors overlooked these red flags based on SBF’s visionary status and mission-driven narrative. The failure was structural. Although there is nothing inherently wrong with believing in a founder’s mission, the law must be agnostic to motives, and governance safeguards must be applied at the appropriate times. As FTX shows, private ordering has its natural limits. Faith in founders is no substitute for the timely implementation of legal guardrails to ensure startups do not engage in crime or fraud. By cloaking SBF in moral credibility, he was allowed to operate with little to no constraints, which ultimately led to the implosion of FTX. To prevent the next FTX, we should tighten the boundaries of private ordering. There are several reforms worth considering: It is tempting to dismiss FTX and SBF as anomalies in an otherwise functional private ordering system. But the conditions that enabled FTX’s meteoric rise and precipitous fall are embedded in the culture of venture-backed startups where there is a bias toward disruption over discipline. Startups cannot be allowed to circumvent legal norms just because they are mission-driven. Founder worship should not override the legal structures that protect investors, employees, and the public. The FTX saga underscores that private ordering has limits. Ultimately, its success depends on the timely implementation of corporate governance measures to ensure legal accountability.

Title: BlackRock’s BUIDL To Power BounceBit’s New RWA Yield Strategy Platform

Financial infrastructure firm BounceBit is tapping into BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) for a new real-world assets (RWA) yield strategy tool. According to a new press release from BounceBit, the collaboration mixes traditional finance with blockchain infrastructure, allowing investors to leverage traditional yields with crypto derivatives trading. Per the announcement, the strategy involves executing Bitcoin (BTC) and stablecoin trades with BUIDL as collateral. BounceBit says the trading strategy could raise total annual percentage yield (APY) for investors by 24%. BUIDL is a BlackRock private fund, which is tokenized by Securitize and made available through its Securitize Markets. According to a post to the social media platform X, the strategy is “the first active use-case for tokenized treasuries.” Says Jack Lu, Founder & CEO at BounceBit, “This innovative approach demonstrates what is possible when investors simultaneously capture both U.S. dollar yields and funding rate arbitrage returns, potentially creating opportunities for institutional investors seeking sustainable USD-denominated yield generation across market cycles.” Last month, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) said that the tokenization of RWAs on blockchains will develop stronger links between crypto and traditional finance (TradFi). In a paper on the financial stability risks of crypto, BIS analysts say that RWAs – or the tokenization of traditional assets on distributed ledgers – are creating an increased connection between TradFi and decentralized finance (DeFi).

Title: The Business Roundtable is MIA Against Trump’s Attacks

U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney in the Oval Office at the White House on May 6, 2025 in Washington, DC. President Donald Trump recently attacked Walmart, the biggest private sector employer in the United States and the largest retailer in the world. Douglas McMillon, CEO of Walmart warned that the Trump Administration’s tariffs could drive cost increases. In response, President Donald Trump took to social media. “Walmart should STOP trying to blame Tariffs as the reason for raising prices throughout the chain. Walmart made BILLIONS OF DOLLARS last year, far more than expected,” seethed the President. “Between Walmart and China they should, as is said, ‘EAT THE TARIFFS,’ and not charge valued customers ANYTHING. I’ll be watching, and so will your customers!!!” Advertisement Advertisement The rebuke comes the very same week that Trump chided revered Apple CEO Tim Cook for manufacturing in India and is merely the latest in a long line of attacks on some of America’s most iconic businesses. So far during his second term, Trump has lashed out at companies such as Amazon, Bank of America, and Boeing. And organizations including AT&T, Harley-Davidson, and Merck have not been immune to Trump’s wrath. However, business leaders are yet to collectively, and definitively, stand up to him. Many completely non-political CEOs saw their firms suffer Trump-initiated stock plunges as they made prudent decisions on how to guide their companies around reckless universal trade sanctions. As Trump’s tariff tantrums threaten to plunge the American economy off a cliff—amidst significant price increases, large layoffs, plummeting business and consumer confidence, and frozen capital investments across industries—CEOs know they need to speak truth to power. But we’ve heard from dozens of Fortune 100 CEOs that they are having a hard time breaking through to President Trump, and conveying the very real dangers facing their businesses, their shareholders, their employees, and their communities. Furthermore, even though 90% of CEOs agree that tariffs are backfiring, they are fearful that if they speak out on their own, they will turn into the next targets of a capricious, vindictive President—as Walmart found out the hard way. Trump fears collective action, and relies on pitting rivals against one another through a divide-and-conquer approach. When business groups stand by in passive inaction when individual CEOs get pummeled, they cede the moral and strategic imperative to Trump’s impulsive whims—ultimately leaving business leaders twisting in the wind. Some trade groups, such as the Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, and the Chamber of Progress—along with other specialized industry groups from the automotive sector to the pharmaceutical industry—have tried to pick up the pieces. However, there are many who wonder why the Business Roundtable, a D.C.-based lobbying firm and association of more than 200 leading CEOs, seems to be missing in action. Indeed, why have they not played a greater role in catalyzing collective action beyond putting out perfunctory statements and purported behind-the-scenes lobbying? This muted response follows other high-profile disappointments from the Business Roundtable in the Trump era, including during his first term. In August 2017, following Trump’s horrifying defense of neo-Nazis who attacked peaceful counterdemonstrators at a rally in Charlottesville, Va., the American business community stood together. The highly-regarded CEO of Merck, Ken Frazier led the charge. In his resignation letter he wrote, “As C.E.O. of Merck and as a matter of personal conscience, I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism.” The son of a well-read custodian, Frazier grew up in North Philadelphia and became one of few black Fortune 500 chief executives. Trump predictably attacked him, which immediately backfired. Over the next several days, CEOs who had once shunned politics came to Frazier’s vocal defense, including the heads of Walmart, Intel, BlackRock, and IBM. When Frazier exited the President’s Business Advisory Group, he set off a high-profile stampede of exits. Frazier’s peer CEOs walked out in solidarity, triggering the disbanding of the two of President Trump's business advisory councils: the Manufacturing Council and the Strategy and Policy Forum. At the time, many CEOs were frustrated that the Business Roundtable remained relatively passive—especially amidst an era of perceived antitrust politicization, with Trump deputies holding up the Time Warner-AT&T deal on specious grounds for 18 months. Similarly, when in November 2020, President Trump refused to acknowledge his electoral defeat, 22 CEOs, frustrated with inaction by the Business Roundtable, asked me to convene an immediate Zoom call for 100 of the nation’s largest CEOs. All showed up—from pharma to finance, advertising to airlines, consumer goods to consulting. During this “Chamber of Conscience” meeting, these business leaders stood up for the importance of certified elections and also certified the truth—meeting for four sessions through the presidential transition under the banner of Business Leaders for National Unity. That silence of the Business Roundtable is a far cry from why it was created. I personally knew the highly engaged, politically diverse founding generation of Business Roundtable members—ranging from Reginald Jones of GE, Clifton Garvin of Exxon, Irving Shapiro of DuPont, George Weyerhaeuser of his eponymous timberland firm, Al Casey of American Airlines, Roger Smith of GM, Jim Burke of Johnson & Johnson, and Roy Vagelos of Merck—and they set up the Business Roundtable explicitly as a vehicle for collective action for CEOs to tackle public policy issues. As Trump attacks our nation’s most iconic enterprises, the Business Roundtable needs to return to its founding principles, purpose, and moral clarity so that CEOs are not left dangling in the wind all alone and defenseless while Trump picks them off individually. CEOs grappling with how to break through to a mercurial President as they watch their enterprises and the broader economy teeter off the ledge know there is strength in collective action—lest they become Trump’s next target. © 2025 TIME USA, LLC.
