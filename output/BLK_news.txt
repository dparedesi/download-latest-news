We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Weight Loss Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN) stands against the other weight loss stocks. Most people have at some point sought to include weight loss and physical exercise in their daily life. The weight loss and fitness market is quite substantial worldwide since improving one's fitness can have direct physical and psychological benefits. Over one billion people worldwide—650 million adults, 340 million adolescents, and 39 million children—are obese, according to the WHO. A novel class of weight-loss medications that don't include strict exercise regimens or diets seems to be revolutionary. People who are overweight or obese can lose 15% to 20% of their body weight with the aid of these ground-breaking medications. According to Andy Acker, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors, "This may be the largest opportunity we've ever seen in the pharmaceutical industry." Weight-loss medications are undoubtedly well-liked. Investors are drawing comparisons between the leader in artificial intelligence chips and the US pioneer in weight-loss drugs. Given this increase in demand, Morgan Stanley Research has raised its forecast for the worldwide obesity medication market from $77 billion to $105 billion by 2030. Branded obesity medications brought approximately $6 billion in 2023. According to Forbes, the most prescribed Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 GLP-1 agonist in 2023 was Semaglutide, the market leader for obesity medications and the generic form of Ozempic, Wegovy, and Rybelsus. It accounted for almost 88% of all new prescriptions. At present, the FDA has approved just three GLP-1 medications for weight control: tirzepatide, liraglutide, and semaglutide. By 2030, the GLP-1 market is expected to grow to $100 billion, driven equally by obesity and diabetes, according to JP Morgan Research. Thirty million GLP-1 users, or around 9% of the population, may be in the US by 2030. The rising demand for obesity drugs will have a broad effect, helping industries like biotech but creating challenges for others like the food and beverage industry. According to Chris Schott, a Senior Analyst specializing in the U.S. Diversified Biopharma industry, “GLP-1s have been used to treat T2D since 2005, starting with the approval of Byetta, with follow-on products continually improving on efficacy. The most recent, Ozempic and Mounjaro, offer significant advantages over previous products and have accelerated class growth,” “Indeed, the newest generations of GLP-1s and combos lead to 15-25+% weight loss on average, well above prior generations of products.” Some are praising the most recent generation of GLP-1 pharmaceuticals as "miracle drugs" for the treatment of obesity. However, because GLP-1s are expensive and have limited insurance coverage, not all obese people can use them. According to Jonathan Gruber, a professor of economics and the chairman of MIT's economics department, the annual cost of treating 40% of obese Americans at the current rate—roughly $15,000 per person—would surpass $1 trillion. That's almost the same as the government spends on the entire Medicare program. That's a staggering figure. According to a study released in the Annals of Internal Medicine, the use of GLP-1 medications, including semaglutide, for weight loss has increased over the last ten years, while it has dropped by about 10% among those with type 2 diabetes. The researchers warn that the ensuing extended drug scarcity may limit the treatments' availability to diabetics. Dr. Yee Hui Yeo, a clinical fellow in Cedars-Sina's Karsh Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, emphasized that it is crucial to ensure that diabetic patients have access to GLP-1 therapies as the demand for obesity medications increases. According to the FDA, growing demand is the cause of the shortages. The European Medicines Agency warned that the GLP-1 medicine shortage is a "major public health concern" that is unlikely to be resolved in 2024, indicating that the shortages affect more than only the US. According to NPR, shortages have made it difficult for those with diabetes to get their prescriptions, and some have had to reduce the medications they can use. The potential of GLP-1 medications, which were first created to treat diabetes but are currently being used to treat obesity, was covered by the panelists on "Weighing the Future of Obesity Drugs," which included Julia Angeles of Baillie Gifford, Debra Netschert of Jennison Investments, and Gentry Lee of Fayez Serofim. Netschert highlighted ongoing efforts to further reduce injection frequency and minimize adverse responses, as well as the development of GLP-1 medicine delivery from weekly dosages to multiple daily injections. Despite their exceptional efficacy, Netschert noted that due to supply limits, 1.5 million of the 110 million eligible patients in the US are now receiving therapy with GLP-1 medications. In their disagreement over who should foot the bill, Netschert pointed to significant insurance and Medicare/Medicaid reimbursements, while Angeles asserted that most patients pay cash. According to Netschert, up to 700 million people globally might require these medications outside of American borders. Notably, the panel found that GLP-1 medications were approved more quickly in the United Kingdom than in any other country, indicating their perceived value. The UK payors are generally stringent. Since the market for obesity medications is still in its infancy, it would be a good idea to add several weight reduction stocks to your watchlists. For this list, we scanned through holdings of weight loss ETFs and online rankings to form an initial list of 20 weight loss stocks. From that list, we picked 12 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund holders as of Q3 2024, based on data tracked by the Insider Monkey database. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42 AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN) is a British-Swedish multinational biopharmaceutical company specializing in developing and manufacturing treatments for diseases such as cancer, respiratory conditions, cardiovascular issues, and autoimmune disorders. Its product portfolio includes biologics, vaccines, and prescription drugs like Tagrisso for lung cancer, Farxiga for diabetes and heart failure, and Symbicort for asthma and COPD. The company is among the largest pharmaceutical companies worldwide. AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN) is advancing in the weight loss and obesity treatment market with innovative drug candidates. AZD5004, an oral GLP-1 receptor agonist licensed from Eccogene, offers a convenient alternative to injectables. Phase I trials demonstrated safety at lower doses, with patients experiencing 5.8% weight loss and improved glucose levels. Now entering Phase IIb trials, AZD5004 is expected to generate $800 million in sales by 2032 due to its favorable tolerability and simplified manufacturing. These developments make AZN one of the best weight loss stocks on our list. AZD6234, a long-acting amylin receptor agonist, targets gastric emptying and appetite suppression, catering to patients intolerant to GLP-1 therapies. Phase I results showed weight loss with manageable side effects. The corporation is exploring its use in combination with AZD9550, a GLP-1/glucagon dual agonist, to enable once-weekly dosing and fat-selective weight loss, enhancing patient convenience and treatment efficacy. By developing oral treatments and combination therapies, AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN) aims to broaden its market presence and meet diverse patient needs in obesity care. As of Q3 2024, 42 hedge funds held shares in the company as tracked by the Insider Monkey database. The largest shareholder in the company was Fisher Asset Management with holdings worth $816.5 million. Analysts hold a consensus Strong Buy rating on the stock. Overall AZN ranks 9th on our list of the best weight loss stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of AZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

In the third quarter of 2024, the company reported a net loss of $24.9 million, or $0.22 per share, an increase from the same period in 2023. This rise in losses was mainly due to higher research and development (R&D) and general and administrative (G&A) expenses. For the nine months ending September 30, 2024, the net loss totaled $74.5 million, or $0.69 per share, driven by similar factors. R&D expenses increased to $22.8 million in Q3 2024 from $18.4 million in Q3 2023, due to higher costs in drug manufacturing, salaries, benefits, and regulatory services. G&A expenses rose to $13.8 million from $8.9 million, largely driven by stock-based compensation, legal and patent services, and third-party consultancy. Despite these higher expenses, Viking Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:VKTX) significantly improved its financial position, with cash holdings of $930 million as of September 2024, up from $362 million at the end of 2023.

Title: Ethereum’s (ETH) Comeback Could Push Its Price to $5000 By the End of 2024, Rival also Positioned for a 31x ROI in 6 Weeks

Most Widely Read Newspaper Kindly share this story: Analysts are now predicting that Ethereum could rise back into the cryptocurrency market’s limelight and surpass its previous all time high of $4,850 in 2024. There are a number of factors driving this optimistic view including substantial market activity and increased institutional entreaty. With this, the accompanying RXS token, which targets real world assets (RWA) is also taking shape, setting the scene for impressive returns during the presale. Ethereum’s Meteoric Rise: Will ETH Hit $5,000 and Beyond in 2025? In the last few months, Ethereum (ETH) has been on an incredible rebound, taking off from a low of about $2,500 in October, to near $4,000 by the time we enter December. A number of key developments in the Ethereum ecosystem have been blamed for this surge. Also notable, the total value locked (TVL) in Ethereum’s decentralized finance (DeFi) projects set new all time highs, suggesting there’s a lot of activity and confidence amongst users. In addition, spot ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs) injection also pulled in huge inflows to invigorate Ethereum’s market position. If Ethereum can hold ground and surge past these key resistance levels, analysts say it’s not unrealistic to see the digital asset reach $5,000 within the next few months. On the technical indicators side, ETH is still bullish as the digital asset remains above key moving averages that indicate that buying interest is likely to persist. Also, different experts in the market have the positive sentiment that Ethereum could be soaring to newer all time highs as far as early 2025. https://x.com/rovercrc/status/1865691790369554473 RXS and Ethereum: The Dynamic Duo Transforming Crypto Investment in 2025 Of course, Ethereum is taking the most attention, but the new token RXS, features its own innovative solution to integrating real world assets into the blockchain space. Runs on the Ethereum network and seeks to fill the gap between classic finance and the decentralized finance space by tokenizing real life physical assets. Therefore, RXS can be considered as a potentially lucrative investment opportunity due to its unique value proposition. RXS is currently in presale and has already made impressive traction. In the next stage, the token price is $0.125, yet before Stage 9 of its presale finishes, it will soar to $0.150. This asset backed token has raised over $25 million on the presale, demonstrating strong investor confidence and demand for this asset backed token. Analyst believe RXS stands for a significant price appreciation in the short term, estimating the ROI up to 31 times in six weeks. https://twitter.com/rexasfinance/status/1857692542290059502 Cryptocurrency market overall is on an uprise, lead from the investor’s interest and developments in the crypto regulatory space. Since institutional players are still entering the market, cryptocurrencies like Ethereum or projects like RXS will have the opportunity to gain from this injection of capital. However, major institutional investor purchases on Ethereum, such as from BlackRock, have propped up Ethereum’s recent price movements. Those endorsements not only furtherWebView the long term potential of Ethereum, but also drive retail investors to enter the space. Additionally, the demand for ETH is likely to rise, too, as more people participate with Ethereum’s ecosystem through decentralized applications (dApps) and NFTs. The fact this adoption is growing, however, will be critical to sustain upward price momentum and could fuel substantial prop up to see $5,000. This inherent synergy is bound to grow between these two tokens, as RXS continues its presale journey on the Ethereum blockchain. As a result of this infrastructure, Ethereum becomes RXS’s starting point as they take a new approach to asset management based on tokenization. This relationship strengthens RXS’s credibility and appeal to investors that are already well accustomed with Ethereum’s ability. As ETH and RXS are expected to make considerable gains in early 2025, with ETH likely to surpass new all time highs and RXS potentially multiplying its value, the upcoming period is looking very exciting for cryptocurrency investment. Conclusion: A Promising Outlook Ethereum and RXS looks to be in good shape as we head into 2025. Investors are closely watching Ethereum’s movement as the crypto is primed to break out above $5,000, aided by strong market dynamics coupled with institutional support. At the same time, RXS is developing into a compelling solution for those who seek to take advantage of creative financial offerings associated with actual world assets.

Title: Bitcoin Hits Record High Against Gold: What It Means For BTC Price?
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-hits-record-high-against-gold-what-it-means-for-btc-price/
Time Published: 2024-12-17T05:30:37Z
Full Content:
Amid its historic price action, Bitcoin (BTC) has quietly hit a new all-time high (ATH) against gold. The insight was highlighted by veteran trader Peter Brandt in an X post. Brandt’s analysis revealed that the BTC-to-gold ratio has reached a new ATH of 32.19 ounces of gold per BTC. In his post, the seasoned trader also took a subtle dig at long-time gold advocate Peter Schiff, a vocal Bitcoin critic. For those unfamiliar, the BTC-to-gold ratio measures Bitcoin’s performance relative to gold, showing how many ounces of gold are needed to purchase one whole BTC. This metric underscores Bitcoin’s growing dominance as a store of value. Brandt further noted that the next target for Bitcoin is 89 ounces of gold per BTC, suggesting significant room for Bitcoin to grow against the precious metal. This aligns with the broader narrative within the crypto industry that Bitcoin is poised to challenge gold’s $15 trillion market cap. It’s worth recalling that Brandt previously predicted Bitcoin would rise 400% relative to gold by 2025. Back in October, he projected that BTC could reach the equivalent of 123 ounces of gold based on historical market patterns. A recent report by trading firm Bernstein added weight to this narrative, forecasting that Bitcoin is on track to replace gold as the preferred safe-haven asset within the next 10 years. As of now, BTC boasts a market cap of $2.11 trillion, steadily closing in on gold’s dominance. Similar forecast was made by one of the earliest Bitcoin advocates, Eric Voorhees. The CEO of ShapeShift crypto exchange made a bold prediction, saying that unlike gold or oil, BTC’s digitally-programmed supply scarcity will drive its price upwards. Additionally, Nate Geraci, President of the ETF Store, predicts that Bitcoin-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could surpass gold ETFs in total assets under management within the next two years. Supporting this outlook, data from SoSoValue indicates that cumulative net inflows into all spot BTC ETFs currently stand at $35.6 billion, compared to gold ETFs, which sit at $55 billion. With BTC surpassing the pivotal $100,000 price level, speculation has grown regarding President-elect Donald Trump’s approach to digital assets. Industry experts believe that Trump may prioritize Bitcoin adoption early in his second term, further boosting BTC’s price. Data supports this optimistic view. According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, the number of BTC whales – wallet addresses holding more than 1,000 BTC – has skyrocketed since Trump’s election victory. This optimism is further fuelled by speculation surrounding a potential US strategic Bitcoin reserve. Prominent financiers argue that if the US were to create such a reserve, China and other nations would likely follow suit to remain competitive. At press time, BTC trades at $106,909, up 3.7% in the past 24 hours.

Title: Does BlackRock own 30% of farmland in Ukraine?! | Tech ARP

Time Published: 2024-12-17T02:23:41Z

Does BlackRock now own 30% of farmland in Ukraine?! Take a look at the viral claim, and find out what the facts really are! Some people are claiming or suggesting that BlackRock now owns 30% of farmland in Ukraine! Wide Awake Media / 1minuterantzz (deleted) : [Ukraine] was one of the biggest agricultural and farming producers globally… Now, 30% of its farmland has been sold off.” “And that has been sold off to three companies… The major shareholder and owner of those three companies… is BlackRock.” “So BlackRock effectively now owns 30% of the farmland in Ukraine.” “Meanwhile, by complete coincidence, laws and new taxes have been brought in in the UK, which… are going to lead to pockets of our farmland having to be sold off… The only way [farmers] can pay those taxes is to sell off… their land.” “Who are they going to sell it to? Big corporations.” “I wonder, could that possibly be BlackRock? Or could it possibly be the now biggest private land owner in the whole of the USA, Bill Gates?” Recommended : Did NATO announce plan for sneak attack on Russia?! This is yet another example of fake news circulating on TikTok and X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, and here are the reasons why… BlackRock does not own 30% of farmland in Ukraine BlackRock is a public-listed company, and that means its assets and accounts are not only audited and publicly disclosed, they must also publicly announce material information, which would include buying up large swathes of farmland in any country. If BlackRock does indeed own 30% of farmland in Ukraine, it would be a matter of public record, and would likely have sparked some outrage in Ukraine. Yet, there are no records of BlackRock purchasing or owning 30% of farmland in Ukraine. Unsurprisingly, people making these claims have never provided any evidence BlackRock purchased or owns 30% of farmland in Ukraine. Ukraine forbids foreign ownership of farmland It would be impossible for BlackRock, or any foreign company, to purchase farmland in Ukraine, as Ukrainian law forbids foreign ownership of farmland! As The Sofia Globe explained: Ukraine’s Land Act states in its article 1 that “land is the prime national asset and is under the special protection of the state.” According to the law agricultural land in the country can be owned only by Ukrainian citizens, companies whose ownership is wholly in the hands of Ukrainian citizens, as well as by local councils and the state. Article 130 prohibits foreign citizens, stateless persons or legal entities from acquiring shares in companies or being members on organisations that own agricultural land. The law says also that those restrictions on land ownership can only be removed through a referendum. Between 1992 and 2021 a moratorium on the trade in agricultural land was in place in Ukraine. It did not allow any land sales, even between Ukrainian citizens. Recommended : Is Biden Admin planning to transfer nuclear weapons to Ukraine?! Even after the moratorium on the sale of agricultural land was lifted in 2021, only Ukrainian citizens and companies could buy or sell farmland. This was confirmed by the US State Department’s 2021 investment climate report on Ukraine: Foreign and domestic private entities can engage in all forms of remunerative activity, with some exceptions: foreign companies are restricted from owning agricultural land, producing bioethanol, and some publishing activities. It is therefore impossible for BlackRock, or any foreign entity, to own 30% of all farmland in Ukraine. Ukraine would have to change its law before any foreigner, or foreign company, can buy agricultural land in Ukraine. Even China could only lease Ukrainian land Even China could only lease 3 million hectares (7.4 million acres) of Ukrainian agriculture land in 2013, for about $2.6 billion per year. And it did so by leasing land owned by Ukrainian government-controlled agricultural company KSG Agro. The farmland would be used mainly to grow crops and raise pigs for the Chinese market. I should point out that massive lease involved less than 10% of farmland in Ukraine. It would be impossible for any country or entity to lease 20% to 30% of farmland in Ukraine without public disclosure. Needless to say – there are no reports of BlackRock leasing large swathes of Ukrainian farmland either! Ukraine invited BlackRock to invest in post-war reconstruction In May 2023, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with BlackRock’s leadership. The Ukrainian government invited the asset management company to participate in an investment fund for the future reconstruction of Ukraine. The investment fund not only involves other multinational companies like JP Morgan, and McKinsey, it does not involve foreign ownership of Ukrainian farmland. In addition, this fund is to meant to rebuild Ukraine after the war with Russia ends. In short – even if BlackRock participates in this Ukraine reconstruction fund, it won’t give the company ownership of 30% of farmland in Ukraine.

Nearly 100 national security officials published a letter calling for a “thorough vetting” of Gabbard, and it was addressed to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and soon-to-be Majority Leader John Thune. Former Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman criticized Gabbard’s views on the Russia-Ukraine war, former head of U.S. counterintelligence Joel Brenner blasted the nomination as “an insult to our intelligence agencies,” and former Senior CIA officer Melvin Gamble said her nomination “should worry any American who cares about keeping our country safe.” But these very same people are part of the cohort of intelligence officials President-elect Donald Trump has signaled he wants to remove from power. FP4A & nearly 100 national security leaders call on the Senate to thoroughly vet Tulsi Gabbard’s nomination for Director of National Intelligence. Her qualifications & past statements raise serious concerns about her ability to serve in this critical role. Full letter here ⬇️ — Foreign Policy for America (@FP4America) December 4, 2024 “This is a perfect example of why President Trump chose Tulsi Gabbard for this position,” Gabbard’s transition spokeswoman Alexa Henning told the Daily Caller. (RELATED: ‘National Security’ Officials Who Endorsed Harris Tied To Intel Agencies, Defense Contractors) “These unfounded attacks are from the same geniuses who have blood on their hands from decades of faulty ‘intelligence,’ including the non-existent weapons of mass destruction. These intel officials continue to use classification as a partisan weapon to smear and imply things about their political enemy without putting the facts out.” U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee to be Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard (R) walks with Sen.

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) Much of the group’s criticism levied at Gabbard centered around her 2017 meeting with then-Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Much of that criticism has been absent for Democratic California Rep. Nancy Pelosi, who also met with Assad in 2007. Sherman, for her part, previously criticized Trump for attempting to remove U.S. troops from Syria in 2018. Asaad fled the country and escaped to Russia after the oppositional coalition Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) overthrew his regime last week. HTS is considered a terrorist organization by many of the world’s governments, including the United States. The group’s leader, Abu Mohammed al-Golani, was previously a leader of an al-Qaeda affiliate in the country. The Daily Caller is working to be your voice in the swamp.

She was his Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs and played a key role in negotiating the Iran nuclear deal. The Obama administration unfroze nearly $2 billion in assets for the Iranian regime in 2016. Rose Gottemoeller, Joel Brenner, and Brian P. McKeon all served in the Obama administration and slammed Gabbard’s nomination. President Obama launched a CIA program in 2013 aimed at removing Assad, but it was ultimately a failure, and Trump ended the program in 2017. Gabbard called Assad a “brutal dictator” in an interview with CNN in 2019, and has defended the meeting as a means of preventing America from being involved in foreign entanglements. “He’s a brutal dictator. Just like Saddam Hussein. Just like Gaddafi in Libya,” Gabbard told CNN. Far from hurting Tulsi Gabbard’s confirmation chances, this week’s events prove out her contention a decade ago that Al Qaeda would be the chief beneficiary of regime change in Syria. The leader of HTS is a designated terrorist and former leader of Al Nusra. — Michael Brendan Dougherty (@michaelbd) December 8, 2024 Some of the officials opposing Gabbard’s nomination are affiliated with organizations focused on combating “disinformation” in elections. Sherman currently serves as a senior fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Belfer Center. Former Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security, John Tien, also signed the letter and is a senior fellow at the Belfer Center. The Belfer Center was involved in the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Agency’s (CISA) training seminars on election “disinformation,” according to a CISA “Disinformation in 2020” YouTube video. The CISA relied on the Center’s “Defending Digital Democracy Project” (D3P), which is led by former Army intelligence officer Eric Rosenbach, and Hillary Clinton and Mitt Romney’s former campaign managers. The Belfer Center also partnered with The National Democratic Institute (NDI) and The International Republican Institute (IRI) to tackle “misinformation in elections,” both of which are funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), according to USA Spending. 6.

Additionally, the Executive Director of Foreign Policy for America, Andrew Albertson, worked in the USAID’s Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI). Multiple Foreign Policy for America members are also tied to Princeton University’s Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, which recently held a discussion with never-Trump neoconservative Bill Kristol. In September 2024, it had an event on “free and fair elections” about “threats of foreign interference, disinformation, [and] political violence.” Former Chief of Staff of the Commission Security and Cooperation in Europe, Alex T. Johnson, signed the letter and was senior policy advisor for Europe and Eurasia at George Soros’s Open Society Foundations until February 2019. Aside from ties to left-wing organizations combating “disinformation,” some of the members are linked to defense contractors or groups funded by them.

Ambassadors Anthony Stephen Harrington and Kenneth S. Yalowitz are both fellows and signed the letter opposing Gabbard’s nomination. John D. Butler, another official listed on the letter, was previously on the board of Lockheed Martin. Rose Gottemoeller, who stated Gabbard has “serious red flags,” is a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for National Peace’s nuclear program. Carnegie received funding from Boeing and Soros’s Open Society Foundations, according to its 2023 report. Former Ambassador Kenneth S. Yalowitz and former Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Annie Pforzheimer, who signed the letter, are both members of the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR). The CFR is funded by Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman in addition to Blackrock, various banks, and tech giants like Google, according its list of corporate members. Well, if national security experts oppose @TulsiGabbard… Say no more! I’m voting to confirm @TulsiGabbard https://t.co/iZIxqnHHvi — Mike Lee (@BasedMikeLee) December 6, 2024 Another official, former Deputy Secretary of State for Management and Resources Brian P. McKeon, is Senior Director of the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement. Classified documents from then-Vice President Joe Biden were discovered at the Penn Biden Center office in 2022. (RELATED: GOP Senators Who Could Block Tulsi Gabbard’s Confirmation Took Huge Checks From Defense Industry) Last Monday, however, hundreds of veterans endorsed Gabbard’s nomination and lauded her military service. “As a Member of Congress and as a civilian, Tulsi has been a stalwart advocate for veterans’ health concerning toxic exposures and cancer care as a result of our fellow veterans’ military service. Tulsi’s life exemplifies a rare blend of selflessness, courage, and leadership—qualities desperately needed to reform and strengthen our intelligence community,” their letter reads.

Title: Jim Cramer on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD): ‘I Think It’s A Buy Ahead Of The Meeting’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Bold Predictions About These 15 Tech Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against the other tech stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. Like all of us, Jim Cramer is always wondering what's next for the stock market. So far, the year has seen AI continue to dominate the market, accompanied by the Federal Reserve and the 2024 US Presidential Election. Now, with the election over and investors pondering over the incoming administration's tariff policies, like us, Cramer is also focused on the Federal Reserve. The reason why the Fed and tariffs are related is because the latter can cause inflation to force the former to keep interest rates higher for longer. While it tries to decipher what's ahead for AI, Wall Street is also wondering about the pace, magnitude, and frequency of the Federal Reserve's 2025 interest rate cut cycle. This nervousness is reflected in bond yields touching 4.38% on Friday, and asset manager Apollo Global warning that four key inflation indicators appear to be reaccelerating. As per Apollo, the Core CPI, the Core PCE, the Supercore CPI, and the Supercore CPE have all started to rise again. In Mad Money aired last week, Cramer also had the Fed in mind. Cramer, in his show, commented on the nervousness in the market. The television show host wondered why the stock market wasn't responding to semiconductor stocks doing well. He started out by sharing that "I hate the endless focus on the Fed. By everybody. Because it detracts you from benefiting from long-term performance for your stock portfolio." This is because Cramer believes that "every little signal from the Federal Reserve brings out predictions, causing many people to sell good stocks when they are freaked out." He did add that the economic data shows that there will be dissent at the Federal Reserve when it comes to further reducing interest rates at the upcoming December meeting. Cramer shared that "while I don't think the data is cool enough to be positive about the prospects of more cuts for now, I also don't want you to make decisions purely on what the Fed does. Contrary to popular belief, there's more to investing than monetary policy. And I wish everyone knew that. They don't." On the topic of tariffs, Cramer had plenty to share in November. He started out by analyzing the performance of the benchmark S&P index between mid-2017 and the start of 2020. Cramer pointed out that "this is where we start to get the real tariff action from the first Trump administration." He shared that "Trump imposed tariffs on steel, aluminum, solar panels, and washing machines among other goods." While "all these helped the industries in question . . .the broader market didn't like that we were triggering a global trade war." Cramer pointed out the index's performance between January 22nd and December 24th, 2018 to bolster the view that tariffs weren't great for the stock market. However, before you write them off, consider his remarks. According to Cramer, during this time period, "the S&P 500 lost 18% of its value. Of course, some of that is because the Fed got much more aggressive about raising interest rates through this period. Taking them up. a 100 basis points that year. But it definitely wasn't just the Fed. You can see from the chart that virtually every time we got more tariffs, the S&P would roll over, every time China retaliated, we'd sell off." Yet, according to Cramer, "once the Fed decided to stop tightening at the very end of 2018, the S&P was finally able to find a floor." Following this, the market "rebounded like crazy" as part of a "bullish trading cycle, one that continued until Covid hit in 2020. Long story short, the market couldn't handle the trade war when the Fed was tightening. But as soon as the Fed started easing, all those losses evaporated." Using charts from Jessica Inskip, Cramer compared the last intersection of the Fed and Trump tariffs with today's environment. He outlined that the "Fed is now our friend." Why is that so? Well, according to Cramer, as soon as the Fed stopped tightening, the market "stopped reacting as aggressively to the trade war." He shared that Inskip believes that "something like a trade war can certainly hurt us badly when the market's already trending bearishly. But if we've got a bullish trading cycle like we do right now, then she's not worried as long as we can maintain this cycle." So, as Cramer remains cautiously optimistic about the stock market's future, we decided to see how his views about stocks have stood the test of time. Our Methodology To make our list of the 15 stocks Jim Cramer has made bold predictions about, we compiled his statements about top tech stocks and ranked them by the date the statements were made. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A close up of a complex looking PCB board with several intergrated semiconductor parts. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 104 Date of Cramer's Comments: 10-04-24 Chip designer Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)'s CEO Dr. Lisa Su was nominated as Time Magazine's CEO of the year in December. In October, Cramer was also full of praise for the executive who has capitalized on Intel's troubles to carve out a place for it in the data center industry and grow PC market share. According to him: “Not to be outdone, Lisa Su, the CEO of AMD, will hold an analyst day and it’s entitled Advancing AI 2024. It starts at noon. Today, when the stock was plummeting, I told investing club members at my 10:20 morning meeting that Su’s presentation could show this charitable trust holding in a whole new light, even as they’ve been raising their AI sales forecast quarter after quarter after quarter. I think it’s a buy ahead of the meeting, although the stock did run eight points after we talked about it at the morning meeting.” Since his remarks, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)'s shares have lost a whopping 22%. The bearishness is built on the firm's third-quarter earnings and a BofA downgrade. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)'s stature as a growth stock meant that when it guided $7.5 billion in revenue for the current quarter, which was in-line with analyst estimates, investors were spooked that it would be unable to capitalize on AI growth. Then, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)'s shares fell by 5.6% after BofA downgraded it to Neutral from Buy and slashed the price target to $155 from $180 as it grew wary of a growth in PC sales in 2025. Overall AMD ranks 13th on our list of the tech stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Venture capital in the U.S. has moved to artificial intelligence (AI) companies at an “unprecedented” rate, HSBC Innovation Banking said Monday (Dec. 16). The scale of capital invested in AI companies by U.S. venture investors is approaching that allocated to the rest of the venture market, the firm said in a Monday press release outlining findings from Innovation Horizons, its latest quarterly outlook for the U.S. technology sector. Forty-two percent of U.S. venture capital was invested into AI companies in 2024, up from 36% in 2023 and 22% in 2022, according to the report. The report also found that as of 2024, 20 AI companies have each raised $2 billion or more. “Venture capital has always gravitated toward transformative industries, but the level of consolidation we’re seeing within one category is unprecedented,” HSBC U.S. Innovation Banking Head Dave Sabow said in the release. “The radical change this investment will fuel places us in the dawn of ‘The Agentic Age,’ an era where autonomous artificial intelligence capabilities fundamentally redefine how we communicate, work and interface with digital and physical worlds.” Investment giant BlackRock said Dec. 7 that it expects 2025 to be a big year for infrastructure and cybersecurity, with the AI boom playing a major role in those investments. “It’s still very early in the AI adoption cycle,” Jay Jacobs, BlackRock’s U.S. head of thematic and active ETFs, told CNBC in a Dec. 7 report. Jacobs added that AI firms need to build out their data centers and that protecting that data will likely be a wise investment. The HSBC report came on the same day that SoftBank said it will invest $100 billion in the U.S. over the next four years, focusing on AI and related infrastructure. HSBC Innovation Banking also found in its report that R&D spending from the so-called Magnificent 7 companies totaled more than all the dollars invested in U.S. startups in 2024, according to the release. The Magnificent 7 are Tesla, Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta, Apple, Amazon and Alphabet. The firm also said in the release that it expects the U.S. tech sector to see new waves of growth and tailwinds for returns resulting from expected changes in the acquisition market, deregulation and fiscal policies that stimulate economic activity. We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: Vera Wang, WHP Global Discuss New Chapter for the 35-year-old Lifestyle Brand

Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily Vera Wang and WHP Global's Yehuda Shmidman talk about new opportunities in global markets and sectors like hospitality. News Director “It’s exciting. Who would have thunk it?” said Vera Wang Monday morning after a deal for WHP Global to acquire her 35-year-old luxury lifestyle brand was revealed. In a telephone interview with Wang and Yehuda Shmidman, chairman and chief executive officer of WHP Global, the two spoke animatedly about plans for the future, and where they see the business headed. Hospitality was high on Wang’s list of growth opportunities. Wang said she wasn’t necessarily actively looking for an investor, but “probably I’ve been searching to expand my brand throughout my whole career and my whole company life.” You May Also Like Related Articles Eye Scoops W Hotels Taps Chloë Sevigny, Miranda Makaroff for New Brand Campaign Business Features Inside Graphic Image and GiGi New York's Unique Manufacturing Facility “I’ve got to be honest: I felt it was the perfect time for Yehuda and for me and for our brand — the synergy and his belief in me. They are in a full growth mode, and I mean it. Frankly, I know that we’ve generated a lot of branding over the past six or seven years, and I think it’s the perfect time for me to execute in ways that I could not have done before. With their enormous support, this gives me an opportunity to grow in a way that I could never have done on my own,” said Wang. Founded in 1990, Wang’s brand today generates over $700 million in annual retail sales across categories including women’s apparel, bridal, men’s tuxedos and suiting, fine jewelry, fragrance, and home, among others. “In all fairness, you need financing and a level of expertise, and also energy, in the sense of desire and passion. All these things are things that Yehuda has in spades,” said Wang. WHP Global is a global management firm that was cofounded by Shmidman in 2019 with the help of funds managed by Oaktree Capital Management, Ares Management, Solus Alternative Assets Management, and BlackRock. Its portfolio of brands runs the gamut from Bonobos, Joe’s Jeans, Rag & Bone and G-Star to Anne Klein, Joseph Abboud, Isaac Mizrahi, Warners, Toys “R” Us and Babies “R” Us. Shmidman told WWD: “This is the quintessential ‘1 + 1 equals 5.’ What Vera built is one of a kind, what the Vera Wang brand is is one of a kind and Vera Wang is a legend and one of a kind. We’re combining with an infrastructure of over $7 billion in sales, and we’re active in over 50 countries,” he added. Shmidman said he and Wang have been talking about going global in Latin America, Asia and the Middle East, to which Wang interjected: “We’ve been global, people don’t really realize that. We’ve been in China for 25 years. We’ll have eight freestanding bridal stores with our partner in China. [There are seven right now]. We have had seven stores in Japan for probably 20 years.” For the past 35 years Wang said her business has been self-financed, although she has had retail partners. In 2006, Wang held acquisition discussions with companies such as Liz Claiborne Inc. and St. John, before striking a lucrative licensing deal with Kohl’s for Simply Vera, Vera Wang in 2007. Wang, a shrewd negotiator, is known for taking her time before striking deals. Asked what attracted him to the Vera Wang brand, Shmidman gave a one-word answer: “Everything.” He said he’s admired and studied the brand for some time. “Vera’s already built the brand in many countries, and there’s still so much more growth potential. When you think of the global industry of fashion and what Vera Wang represents to people and the emotional connection to people, this is all about the future. It’s all about what we can do together,” he said. He said Wang will not only continue as founder and chief creative officer of her brand, but she will be “an important shareholder of WHP Global.” Citing opportunities for the brand, Shmidman said when one thinks about the DNA of Wang’s business, everyone will say bridal. “There are so many aspects of fashion already built, and more to come, and of course, there’s home, but there’s more,” he said. Wang added that she’s been in hard home and soft home for years, with a thriving business in sheets and towels, “not only at Kohl’s but at Macy’s.” She also has a licensing deal with Waterford Wedgwood. “The future of that is still gift registry and bridal registry and the amount of product we continue to create in crystal, plates, bone china, and silver. All these things have been going on forever,” said Wang. Wang revealed that one of the biggest opportunities in their plans is hospitality. “That’s one of the most important categories that I could never tackle. I’ve had piecemeal offers,” she said. Wang said she’s had a branded suite at the Halekulani in Hawaii for over 15 years. And there were times in her life when she almost did a deal in Singapore for a Vera Wang hotel and chapels for weddings. “I’ve had a lot of stuff going on for 35 years, it was never was the right time and situation for me. But my first concern always was my core company and competency. This [deal] enables me to begin to explore other areas that I could never possibility get to,” said Wang. Wang said she’d like to do hotels, some which could be bridal-oriented and some style-oriented. She likes to be local and bring a modern style sensibility to whatever country she’s in while respecting their heritage. “I’ve had so much experience in Italy and France, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Taiwan, Bangkok…. I just feel there’s a lot to offer there. Of course, bridal is a bit of a tease, but I think it’s a very important part of hospitality. I don’t know a hotel opening right now that doesn’t want to attract a huge event. There are very few that are bigger than bridal,” she said. Asked if she’d like to sign a license for high-end ready-to-wear, Wang was game. “That could happen, right, Yehuda? That will happen,” said Wang. Shmidman added, “The reality is the opportunities are almost endless in the best of ways. What begins in bridal extends to all fashion, expands to all home, lifestyle, and now you’re the first person to hear about the vision into hospitality.” Asked if the Vera Wang staff will remain intact, Shmidman said that they’ve signed the deal but haven’t closed yet. All the details and particulars will be forthcoming post-closing, which is expected in the new year. When he was specifically asked about his modus operandi when he takes over a company, such as Rag & Bone, and whether the infrastructure remains intact, Shmidman said it does. “Everything is about growth; what is amazing that it’s already built and how do we expand and grow?” He said WHP in the past six years has gone from zero to over $7 billion. “With Vera and other initiatives I wouldn’t be surprised if we surpass $8 billion next year.” The company has five offices around the world. Wang believes she has created a company that’s unique for a fashion company. “It’s emotional. We are an emotional company. We dress women on the most important days of their lives for their public — their friends, their family, their relatives. I don’t mean that giving birth to your first child isn’t emotional, I’m saying for your most public moment. When you think of the amount of weddings I have done at all price points, over 35 years, I can honestly say as an ex-skater, that I win the Olympic gold medal for the amount of weddings I attended, the amount of brides I have dressed. We’re truly based on a sense of romance and a sense of commitment and optimism. The most optimistic thing you do is to get married,” said Wang. Wang said she’ll continue to pursue deals at both the high-end and for stores such as Kohl’s and Zales. She just signed new initiatives with Jared and Zales, and has new fragrances in the works with Coty. “This is an opportunity for me to flex what’s it’s taken for me to build a company. I had no investors, and I did this self-funded, and I had no partners until now. And you know better than I how difficult it is,” said Wang. She said this is her 55th year in fashion, she just had her 75th birthday, and this is her 35th year in business. “These three milestones were this year,” said Wang, who had to leave the call because she had to take a call with the White House. Asked what that was about, she said, “I have no idea. It’s anybody’s guess.” Consultants think the acquisition makes sense for both parties. Robert Burke, chairman and CEO of Robert Burke Associates, said, “They [WHP] are really trying to go after a premium brand portfolio like Rag & Bone, G-Star and Joe’s Jeans. What’s unique about Vera’s business is that she’s always been very focused on being a lifestyle brand and a brand that has the potential for licensing. She was very early on with the mattress deal and the Lenox tabletop. She tapped into that bridal market and realized it was multifaceted. If she couldn’t make it, she partnered with someone who could. “She’s still the most internationally recognized label in bridal, hands-down. I think there’s still a great deal of room for her brand to grow,” said Burke. Andrew Jassin, managing director of Jassin Consulting Group, said, “Stuart [Kreisler, director of Jassin Consulting Group] and I have had a long relationship with Vera Wang. We are the ones that created the licenses for fine jewelry, and wine and prosecco, as well as with some other extensions. Though Vera Wang has many successful licensing partnerships, we believe that Vera Wang has been relatively conservative in its licensing. I think it is a brilliant move by WHP; Vera Wang is a truly global brand with incredible consumer connectivity. WHP will extend the Vera Wang bandwidth via their professional licensing and management team. This is a win-win for everyone involved.” Sign up for WWD news straight to your inbox every day Get all the top news stories and alerts straight to your inbox.

Title: 10 business leaders who spearheaded industry-transforming change in 2024
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/transforming-business-executives-creating-change-media-tech-finance-transportation-2024-12
Time Published: 2024-12-16T19:48:03Z

Innovation and business go hand in hand — and that's constantly on enterprise leaders' minds, regardless of their industry. Executives must understand how technological advancements, systemic barriers, and generational shifts are affecting their growth, then strategize accordingly. Business Insider's annual list of people transforming business highlights these leaders who work in media, finance, technology, transportation, and labor. The WNBA's first female commissioner, Cathy Engelbert, is spearheading a transformation in the sports sector with her focus on fan engagement and equity among players. In finance, Leon Sinclair is leveraging data and analytics to reshape the world of alternative investments at Preqin, where he's an executive vice president. Mike Hopkins, the head of Amazon's Prime Video and MGM Studios, is forging an ad-focused entertainment-business strategy that could redefine how content is made and consumed in the digital age. Below, in alphabetical order by first name, are the 10 business leaders our reporters and editors credit with shaking up and remolding their industries. Employers often say they prefer to hire employees who act like owners. As the executive director of the nonprofit Ownership Works, Miller aims to get employers to act on that ethos. "It's not credible to ask employees to feel, think, and act like owners if you don't give them a financial ownership stake," Miller said. Since its founding in 2021, Ownership Works and its corporate partners have shared $570 million in wealth across six companies and worked with more than 160,000 workers at 113 companies. One way Miller seeks to convince business owners of the merits of employee shareholding is by showing them how it can improve the bottom line. She pointed to a time an employee in an Ownership Works company helped their employer save money by replacing a component costing $100 with a 3D printed part that cost just a few dollars. "They often know where the company is losing money or making a mistake or where things could be better," Miller said. "And they often have ideas for how to fix the problem. It's just nobody ever asked them to." Miller's career in employee ownership grew out of an interest in community development. Early in her career she helped a nonprofit in Hawaii create farming cooperatives, and she worked with another nonprofit to convert small businesses into worker cooperatives. Miller said she wanted to find scale, so she approached Pete Stavros, KKR's cohead of private equity. Stavros first experimented with employee ownership at a garage-door manufacturer in 2015, leading to some of KKR's best results. He was looking to spread that model further. After announcing the creation of Ownership Works with a $10 million donation, Stavros hired Miller as his first employee. Now it's her job to help the company's 25 private-equity partners, including KKR and Apollo, institute plans in their portfolios. She does this in part by partnering with accountants, lawyers, and professional-services firms to make it easier to create these plans, acting as an employee-ownership consultancy. The organization also collects and shares metrics of success, such as hundreds of millions of dollars in grants to employees and decreasing turnover and higher profits at companies with employee ownership. She's helping the nonprofit expand beyond private equity. Ownership Works recently worked with the cold-storage company Lineage to give $100 million in IPO proceeds to its employees and create a stock-ownership plan. Miller believes that expanding employee ownership could significantly narrow the wealth gap and reduce financial insecurity. Sadoun said he mostly received pushback when, in 2017, he told creative agencies that the future of creativity was commerce and AI. "It's funny when you look at what happened now," Sadoun, the chief executive of the French advertising giant Publicis Groupe, told BI. Back then, Sadoun faced a daunting task. He had just taken over as the third-ever leader of the 91-year-old company, home to the storied agencies Leo Burnett, Saatchi & Saatchi, and Publicis Conseil, which had created iconic advertising like the Marlboro Man, Tony the Tiger, and "Labour Isn't Working." But Publicis was languishing behind its competitors having lost key clients like McDonald's. Financial growth was anemic. Sadoun embarked on a plan to turn Publicis from a communications partner to a company that could help clients transform their businesses. He sought to break down silos between Publicis' various agencies and help them retool around a bet on "personalization at scale," advanced by the biggest acquisition in its history: the 2019 purchase of the data marketing firm Epsilon for $4.4 billion. "The financial market did not like that," Sadoun said. Neither did many of Publicis' own employees, particularly the Don Draper-esque creatives who were maddened that an outsize focus on data and programmatic ads meant the Parisian company would lose its je ne sais quoi. Competitors mocked Publicis' multimillion-dollar investment in creating an AI platform. Sadoun and Publicis are having the last laugh. At about $27 billion, Publicis' market capitalization is the largest of any individual advertising-agency holding company. It's forecast to end the year with the largest annual revenue, too, with the combination of its data and media offerings representing about half of its sales. While 2024 was a cause for celebration, it faces challenges ahead: This month, its rival Omnicom announced a deal to acquire Interpublic Group that would create the largest ad-agency network. Sadoun described Publicis' award-winning campaign for the French telco Orange as a good outward representation of its modernized offering to marketers. The commercial begins with stars from the French men's national football team flaunting their skills. The reveal — using VFX and deepfake technology — is that the stars of the ad were in fact from Les Bleues, the women's national team. Sadoun credits his leadership team and employees for Publicis' turnaround. He has a more personal hope for his own legacy. In 2022, Sadoun had an operation to remove a tumor in his neck that turned out to be cancerous. Unusually for the CEO of a public company, he disclosed his diagnosis before he underwent treatment: grueling rounds of chemo and radiotherapy that would affect the jet-setting executive's ability to travel. He was flooded with messages revealing that many people were hiding their chronic illnesses from their employers and colleagues. The following year, Sadoun helped launch the Working with Cancer Pledge, which encourages companies to commit to offering more recovery-focused working environments. More than 600 companies have signed up, and the initiative was promoted with a splashy Super Bowl ad bought and created by Publicis last year. "My one mission in life now, apart from my family, is to erase the stigma of cancer in the workplace," Sadoun said. 2024 was a transformative year for the WNBA. It said that attendance increased by nearly 50% year over year and that ratings on ESPN were up by 170% from last season, fueled in part by its rookie stars like Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese. Sponsorship deals have boomed, bringing in advertisers newer to the sports world like Bumble and Skims. Presiding over its astronomical growth is Engelbert, a former Deloitte CEO who became the league's commissioner in 2019. The league has been planting the seeds of its growth for a while. It gained attention by playing during the pandemic in a bubble. It raised $75 million from investors, allowing it to invest in marketing and fan engagement. And it landed sponsorships on its own, separate from the NBA. External factors like the rise of "name, image, and likeness" deals and social media also helped draw attention to the sport. "The thing that was overlooked is that Rome wasn't built in a day," Engelbert told BI. "We didn't do this overnight." One emphasis was on improving the fan experience by meeting spectators where they were, such as updating the app to look more like TikTok, Engelbert said. The WBNA is a big brand now, and with its growth has come scrutiny. Engelbert took heat when she didn't directly condemn threatening comments on social media toward players but likened the situation to a rivalry between male players in the 1970s. She later apologized, promising to do better. "We've been debriefing around a lot of things that happened this year," Engelbert told BI, adding that the league was looking at beefing up security and mental-health resources. "The vitriol our players, me, we all get, we're going to try to tackle that multidimensionally." Engelbert also wants to talk about the flip side. "There's a huge negative to all the vitriol, but there's also people caring about the league like they haven't before," she said. "Apathy's the death of a brand, and there's no more apathy." The WNBA, which is majority-owned by the NBA, remains unprofitable; several outlets described sources as saying it was on track to lose $40 million or more this season. The WNBA declined to comment. Increased sponsorship and media rights will be crucial to keeping up the W's momentum and getting in the black. In a big start, the women's league recently struck an 11-year, $200 million media-rights deal, up from its current deal of $60 million a year. Engelbert also has her sights set on global expansion, starting with the WNBA getting its first Canadian franchise next year. Corporate sponsorships are catching up to the rise of women's sports. Engelbert is ready to capitalize, with stats to appeal to the bottom line. "There's a little scratching and clawing to make sure the old view of the WNBA is not the current view," she said. "Our fans are actually likely to buy from you. So we say this is a good business decision for you." Almost 20 years ago, while she taught at Princeton, Li, known as the "godmother of AI," tested the hypothesis that everything humans could see could be categorized and labeled. This idea built off her graduate research focused on object recognition. Li harnessed the power of crowdsourcing to pioneer ImageNet, a database of 15 million images that became the foundation of computer-vision and deep-learning research. Li has continued advancing this research. This year, she and the leading AI researchers Justin Johnson, Christoph Lassner, and Ben Mildenhall launched World Labs, a startup that aims to take AI beyond large language models. It's valued at $1 billion. With $230 million in funding from investors like Andreessen Horowitz, AMD Ventures, and Nvidia's NVentures, World Labs is seeking to explore AI applications in the two-dimensional plane of pixels and in 3D worlds with spatial intelligence. In December, World Labs dropped its first AI project: a tool designed to turn any image into a 3D model. Since her initial research breakthroughs, Li has testified before Congress about applying responsible ethics to AI and has advocated the inclusion of more women and people of color in the field. "Language is important but, as humans, much of our ability to understand and interact with the world is based on what we see," Li wrote in an op-ed article in The Economist in November. She believes spatial intelligence — which can help with developing robots that look after older adults, or extra hands for a surgeon — is what truly human-centered AI will look like. She's now a codirector of Stanford University's Institute for Human-Centered AI and serves as the Sequoia Capital professor of computer science at Stanford. Li has also worked as a vice president and chief scientist of AI and machine learning at Google Cloud. Huang is becoming the stuff of legend. He has a reputation as a genius, a visionary, and a workaholic. Bosses everywhere want to know his every theory of management to replicate even a fraction of his success. That's because Nvidia has gone from a niche tech firm to one of the most valuable companies in the world in a little more than two years. After decades of toiling out of the limelight, providing the video-gaming industry with graphics chips to render complex, ever-changing imagery but not gaining much name recognition beyond it, Nvidia burst into broader consciousness in 2022, after ChatGPT came to the market. Word quickly spread that the company had for years been buying thousands of Nvidia graphics processing units — it turned out that the kind of computing they're best at is similar to the demands of artificial intelligence. Huang actually donated OpenAI's first eight GPUs, delivering them himself. But Huang anticipated the connection between his chips and AI long before then — he just didn't know how it would materialize. Huang, 61, was born in southwestern Taiwan. He studied electrical engineering at the University of Oregon and Stanford. He had a few jobs in the semiconductor industry, including at Nvidia's major competitor AMD, until he founded Nvidia at 30 with Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem. Despite the recent spotlight on him now, Huang has staying power. He's one the longest-serving tech CEOs, with more than 30 years at the helm. In a recently published memoir, Morris Chang, the founder of Nvidia's most important supplier, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, described offering Huang the CEO job at TSMC. Even now that Nvidia has a market capitalization of more than $3 trillion, Huang sees his work as far from finished. "I watched Jensen make these kinds of bets that are far-reaching, where there's a lot of ambiguity as to when it's going to happen or not," Rev Lebaredian, a vice president of omniverse and simulation technology at Nvidia, told Business Insider this year. Huang is usually right. The journey to enter 2025 with hundreds of foundation models chasing ChatGPT started for Nvidia in about 2006. The next big journey may be self-driving cars and robots, or something else entirely. Some investors still worry that when it comes to Nvidia, what goes up must come down. But investors also believe that if anyone can see or make the future, it's Huang. Sinclair, who grew up in the market town of Rugby in the middle of England, didn't picture a career in finance. "We never really spoke about money around the dinner table or anything like that because there was never any of it," the 42-year-old told Business Insider in an interview. Now Sinclair is helping demystify private markets and powering its growth through data. With civil service in mind, he studied political science at Loughborough University and joined England's Department of Health shortly after graduating in 2004. But Sinclair, a competitive basketball and track athlete, quickly tired of the bureaucracy and craved a faster-paced work culture. After six months, he left for a research-analyst position at Intercontinental Exchange, the operator of major stock exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange and clearinghouses. The finance novice was eager to catch up and learn as much as he could about debt products and subprime markets. He left in 2010 for the data provider Markit, well before the firm merged with IHS and was acquired by S&P Global. Throughout his two-decade career he has maintained a sense of intellectual curiosity, describing himself as one of the most avid readers of industry news among his peers. Drawn to the complexity of private markets, he pivoted away from credit to build IHS Markit's private-equity and debt division. In 2023, he joined the private-markets-data powerhouse Preqin. "You see some of the most innovative companies in the world, and you work with some of the most innovative funds in the world who are deploying capital into just really interesting spaces," he said. Sinclair oversees how Preqin addresses the needs of fund managers, investment banks, and placement agents, representing some 3,000 front-office teams, trying to navigate the opaque industry of private markets. Preqin says the asset class has more than doubled to $16.8 trillion in assets under management over the past five years. Preqin's data can be used, for instance, to target limited partners for fundraising or create customized benchmarks to better convey performance to investors. Private markets are becoming more transparent as providers like Preqin find ways to combine publicly available and proprietary data, Sinclair said. In June, his division launched a data tool to analyze deals across 6,500 funds. This aggregated data can be used to back up valuations in negotiations or identify which financial factors, such as revenue growth or debt pay-down, contributed the most value to a successful deal. The firm's insights are set to become more widely available, as BlackRock is set to acquire Preqin for $3.2 billion. Sinclair said it's easier for individual investors to participate in private markets than ever before, pointing to the growth of data products and favorable regulatory developments. But he added that having options isn't the same as understanding them. "There's a massive amount of education to do. Alternatives have a totally different vocabulary, a different way of thinking about performance, a different way of thinking about risks to the types of products," he said. "I think there's also an obligation of the industry to build the right analytical tools, the right educational tools, datasets to bring the mass affluent along on that journey." The electric-vehicle market has experienced tremendous upheaval in the past year, and car companies are scrambling to understand today's EV buyers. At Ford, Gjaja, the chief operating officer of the Model e electric division, is tasked with navigating the money-losing division through huge changes in demand and customer profiles. After years of growth in the EV segment driven by wealthy early adopters, car companies face the challenge of selling these expensive and complex vehicles to more-regular customers. Ford split its gas and electric divisions in 2022 in a bid to speed up EV development. The company's EV strategy has changed a few times since then, but Ford still breaks out its financial performance: So far in 2024, the Model e division has lost $3.6 billion. In his operations role, Gjaja is trying to reverse those losses by working with Ford's dealers to improve customer experiences and perceptions. Before joining Ford in 2022, Gjaja was a senior partner at Boston Consulting Group, where he worked with clients in retail, technology, and automotive, among other industries. He's putting those years of consulting experience to work as Ford tries to bridge the gap between the wealthy early adopters behind the initial success of vehicles like the Mustang Mach-E and the F-150 Lighting and the more-practical customers who more often leave the lot with a hybrid. While higher prices have turned off some of these new EV shoppers, Gjaja said at an automotive conference in September that this cohort was considering a lot more than sticker price — including their distance from the nearest charger, the cost of charging, battery life, and resale values. Gjaja argued that simply discounting electric cars wouldn't be enough to convince shoppers and certainly wouldn't solve Ford's profitability problem in its Model e division. Instead of focusing on "functional economics," Gjaja said, he examines the "behavioral economics" of EV adoption. He said the journey from what he called an EV denier to a long-term convert could take up to three years. "My job is to figure out how to sell and market a vehicle that people don't appreciate its value until they own it for three years," Gjaja said. Amazon is a retail and cloud powerhouse, and thanks to Hopkins, it's become a media powerhouse, too. Under Hopkins, Amazon now offers not just a wide variety of TV and films but some of the biggest sports franchises like the NFL and the NBA, and even news. Amazon spent $18.9 billion on video and music in 2023, up by 14% from 2022. According to the data firm Ampere Analysis, sports is a growing part of Amazon's entertainment outlay, accounting for 14.3% in 2024, up from virtually nothing five years ago. Amazon's entertainment offerings help keep people subscribing to Prime, the free-delivery service that includes Prime Video and other benefits. But it's also becoming a moneymaker in its own right. In January, Amazon shook up the streaming-ads market when it turned on ads in Prime Video, driving down ad prices for competitors like Netflix while giving Amazon a big shot at the $28.8 billion pie that EMARKETER has forecast will be spent on streaming-TV ads this year. Morgan Stanley has estimated the move could bring in $3.3 billion in revenue this year, on top of Amazon's existing ad business, worth $47 billion in 2023. And with NFL and other streaming rights, Amazon is muscling in on traditional TV networks' turf and training viewers that it's the place to go for live sports. It's even dipped a toe in news, the last stronghold of traditional TV, with a Brian Williams-hosted election-night special. Hopkins' hire in 2020, along with the NBC entertainment vet Jennifer Salke's two years earlier, was a big signal that Amazon was serious about establishing itself as a key player in entertainment. Hopkins is a product of legacy and digital entertainment, having been the chairman of Sony Pictures Television and the CEO of Hulu. At Amazon, he oversaw the $8.5 billion acquisition of the film studio MGM and pushed the company's entertainment studio to expand into broader fare. Prime Video also makes money by fulfilling its promise of being a one-stop shop for viewers by selling subscriptions to other companies' apps like Max, Starz, and, in its most recent flex, Apple TV+. "What we're trying to build is a next-generation entertainment service," Hopkins recently told Bloomberg. Prime Video captured just 3.7% of TV viewing in November, well behind Netflix (7.7%) and YouTube (10.8%), per Nielsen. Despite some wins, like the popular show "The Boys" and the buzzy film "Saltburn," it has a way to go in becoming a consistent hit factory. Still, since most people don't pay for Prime Video as a stand-alone service, it doesn't have the churn problem that dogs other streamers. As part of Amazon, Prime Video is also insulated from some of the financial pressures affecting other entertainment companies. Hopkins is still bringing financial discipline to bear, however. Amazon cut hundreds of jobs across Prime Video and MGM Studios teams early in 2024. Hopkins recently told Bloomberg that the advertising ramp-up was a factor in pursuing NBA rights and that he expected Prime Video to be profitable "very soon." Since 2021, Varkey has been the president of the Mayo Clinic Health System, a network of 16 community hospitals and 45 multispecialty clinics across more than three dozen communities in Minnesota and Wisconsin. The facilities serve rural areas where care can otherwise be difficult to access. Varkey, who comes from a family of physicians, said her work focused on reaching patients without ready access to the sprawling Mayo Clinic campus in Rochester, Minnesota, and its world-renowned medical expertise. Varkey told Business Insider that part of her focus was finding new ways to incorporate technology so that more people can obtain care and administrative burdens can be reduced. That includes using artificial intelligence to help with diagnosing conditions and using technology so that clinicians can manage complex chronic conditions virtually. The efforts also include introducing a mobile clinic that can go where routine and preventive care is needed and even provide wireless internet access so patients can confer with specialists. The clinic, which travels across southern Minnesota, offers virtual or in-person appointments. It has two exam rooms and a laboratory. "So now you have preventive exams, specialist visits that are occurring in very remote areas," she said. Varkey said Mayo Clinic Health System was also trying to bring medical expertise to rural residents through programs that connect small local clinics with specialists from hub sites or from Mayo's Rochester campus. Small clinics, she said, might have only a single nurse practitioner — nothing like the variety of disciplines a larger facility would have. "It's been very exciting to watch, and patients have really appreciated it as well," Varkey said. Another effort to meet patients where they are is the organization's hospital-at-home program. Varkey said remote monitoring technology helped these patients remain with family and be more comfortable than they'd be in a medical facility. "You get the same Mayo care," she said, adding that the approach had been popular with patients. Varkey, who also holds an MBA from the University of Minnesota, returned to Mayo in 2021 after serving as the president and CEO of Yale New Haven Health Northeast Medical Group. From 2001 to 2013, Varkey held leadership positions at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, including associate chair of the Department of Medicine, medical director of Ask Mayo Clinic, and program director of the Preventive Medicine Fellowship. Varkey said the expanding capabilities of AI and discoveries in genomics and molecular medicine were "taking healthcare to the next level — and very fast." While those developments are exciting, Varkey said, they shouldn't distract from the primary goal of patient-centered care. Kapila likes to stay ahead of the game. During the first 10 years of his career, the computer-science graduate completed four certifications each year while working as a tech consultant for firms like Nasdaq and Sallie Mae. While working at the hedge fund Citadel in the mid-2000s, he took MBA classes at night at Northwestern University. "Everything in this field changes so quickly," he said. "Things change in finance and things change in tech at an ever increasing pace." Now Kapila is a copresident and chief operating officer of Parametric, a pioneer of direct indexing with $570 billion in assets under management. He joined Parametric in 2019 after rising up the ranks at BlackRock, overseeing portfolio construction management for its widely used Aladdin platform. Kapila moved to a much smaller firm to have a bigger impact. "It was an opportunity to kind of look at what Parametric has done well, think about how to build on the success, but then also take advantage of what's happening in the technology space and rethink how Parametric could operate, let's say, five years from that point," he said. His move was well timed. There has been a boom in direct indexing, a tax-savvy investing strategy of buying individual securities modeled off an index like the S&P 500. Two years after Kapila joined Parametric, Morgan Stanley acquired Parametric's parent company, Eaton Vance. Thanks to a wave of similar acquisitions, Parametric faces well-capitalized competitors such as BlackRock's Aperio and Franklin Templeton's Canvas. Industry stalwarts like Fidelity and upstarts like Envestnet also want a piece of the action. Kapila said Parametric, founded in 1987, has experience and scale on its side. "I will say that given the technology trends, sometimes it's easy to come in and have a solution. It's much, much harder to have a scalable solution that will serve clients when the demand spikes," he said. "We're managing over 200,000 accounts for our clients. The level of scale, I think, often is a breaking point for some of the newer entrants." To stay ahead of the competition, Kapila is pushing Parametric to develop more automated products, such as Radius, which launched this year. Radius constructs fixed-income and equity portfolios and runs simulations to identify the best selections for portfolio managers. Kapila described it as a "turning point" for Parametric. "This is the first time we've had a product that's really end-to-end running in that automated platform manner with a person reviewing and approving and intervening as necessary," he said. He plans to launch more cloud-native tools, which are easier to scale and manage, for other asset classes in 2025 and 2026. Parametric is also bringing its tax-savvy strategies to active management, launching Custom Active this summer. Rather than modeling portfolios off indexes, clients can pick equities off strategies from its asset-management partner Lazard or sports-league sponsors. "Those are examples where we can provide a tax overlay and help people get the advantages of direct indexing while managing to an active model," Kapila said. "There's a demand for that, and it's early days," he added, "but I think that's really what's playing out." Jump to

Ethena Labs is announcing the launch of a new US dollar-pegged stablecoin that will be backed by BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL). According to a new announcement from the Arthur Hayes-backed crypto protocol, the new stablecoin, USDtb, will be Ethena’s second stablecoin offering, following the project’s flagship stablecoin USDe. USDtb differs from other stablecoins in that it will be backed by a fund backed by one of the world’s largest and most trusted asset managers, BlackRock. In October of this year, multiple reports tied BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, with the idea of using BUIDL, the crypto asset related to the firm’s tokenized mutual fund, as collateral for trading derivatives contracts. BUIDL, which launched in March of this year, is a tokenized money-market fund designed to offer a stable value of $1 per token built on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain that offers “blue-chip” yields. As stated by Robert Mitchnick, BlackRock’s head of digital assets, in a press release issued by Securitize, BlackRock’s brokerage partner, “[BUIDL] is the latest progression of our digital assets strategy. We are focused on developing solutions in the digital assets space that help solve real problems for our clients.” Generated Image: Midjourney Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 11 Best Aerospace and Defense Stocks to Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG) stands against the other best aerospace and defense stocks to buy. According to a report by Dinan Capital Advisors, the aerospace and defense industry's EBITDA multiples increased by around 8% on average during the third quarter of 2024. Within the industry, the Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) segment stood out with the highest EBITDA multiple of more than 19%. The robust performance in the sector was driven by increased government spending, AI defense implementation, and increased global travel. As per the report, the global market size of the aerospace and defense sector is estimated to grow from $1 trillion to around $1.5 trillion during the next decade. There are various factors contributing to growth within the industry. Firstly, the defense sector is experiencing significant expansion due to the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine. This rising defense demand resulted in a record defense order backlog of $747 billion, indicating an 11% increase year-over-year. Moreover, the Senate Armed Services Committee has projected that Congress will finalize the FY25 US defense budget at approximately $833 billion, exceeding last year's spending limits. In addition to increased defense spending, which is one segment of the overall aerospace and defense industry, international air traveling is also improving. According to a report by FlightGlobal, the global passenger traffic grew by 7.4% subsequently during the third quarter. Although the profitability of the global airline industry is still down by around $1.7 billion year-over-year, the subsequent growth in passengers indicates an ongoing recovery.

Mitchell Reiss, American diplomat and distinguished fellow at the Royal United Services Institute appeared on a CNBC interview on November 7 to discuss how the defense sector will perform under President-elect Donald Trump. He said that the United States government is expected to increase its defense spending under President Donald Trump. Currently, defense spending is at its lowest level since 1998 and the geopolitical situation is more dangerous than the said year. Reiss thinks that the president will double down on some of the initiatives from his first term. Trump sees China as a United States adversary and he sees Israel and Saudi Arabia as stabilizing forces in the Middle East and will want to build upon the Abraham Accords. He also thinks that the president will call upon its European allies to increase defense spending. While Reiss expects the United States' defense spending to increase, he also noted that a third of the NATO countries are still not hitting the 2% mark in terms of their defense spending. Considering the geopolitical tensions between Russia and Ukraine, European countries would also naturally pivot towards increasing their defense spending. Reiss believes that if someone is interested in defense stocks there is a lot of growth potential within the industry.

To curate the list of the 11 best aerospace and defense stocks to buy right now, we used the Finviz stock screener. Using the screener we aggregated a list of companies working in the aerospace and defense industry and sorted them by market capitalization. Next, we sourced the number of hedge funds holding each company from Insider Monkey’s Q3 2024 database. The list is ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 71 TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG) is a company that designs, produces, and supplies specialized parts for aircraft. These parts are essential for both commercial and military airplanes. It specializes in highly engineered components which are sold as replacement (aftermarket) parts and to Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). One of the key competitive edges of the company comes from its range of proprietary aerospace components which are mainly sold in the aftermarket. Management has shifted its focus to the aftermarket segment as it generates more margins, as a result around 90% of its net sales for fiscal 2023 came from this segment. In addition, TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG) has also been concentrating on expanding its proprietary product portfolio and has taken some bold steps toward this goal. For instance, management acquired SEI Industries and CPI Electron Device Business during the current fiscal year. Both companies have a line-up of specialized products catering to the aerospace and defense sectors. During the fiscal third quarter of 2024, the company surpassed its revenue guidance by posting $2.05 billion, up 17.3% year-over-year. Its net income was also encouraging and improved by 31% during the same time to reach $461 million. Management has also revised its full-year EBITDA guidance from $3,995 million to $4,095 million to an updated range of $4,100 million to $4,160 million. It is one of the best aerospace and defense stocks to buy right now. Mar Vista Strategic Growth Strategy stated the following regarding TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG) reported another earnings beat-and-raise during its fiscal third quarter as it continues to benefit from a surge in global travel, surpassing pre-pandemic levels. The airlines posted no significant change in aircraft order or delivery patterns despite overcapacity issues. Both Boeing and Airbus remain in a holding pattern on producing and delivering new units due to manufacturing quality and labor issues (strike) in the case of Boeing and supply chain challenges in the case of Airbus. This plays directly into the hands of TransDigm’s most profitable business, commercial aerospace aftermarket, as load factors remain high, and take-offs and landings continue to grow beyond pre-pandemic levels. Moreover, the company announced a significant special dividend to be paid in October 2024. Even with this payment, TransDigm has over $5.5 billion of capital to execute its acquisition strategy in what should be a robust M&A market in 2025.” Overall, TDG ranks 3rd on our list of best aerospace and defense stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential of TDG to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TDG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

According to a report by Dinan Capital Advisors, the aerospace and defense industry's EBITDA multiples increased by around 8% on average during the third quarter of 2024. Within the industry, the Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) segment stood out with the highest EBITDA multiple of more than 19%. The robust performance in the sector was driven by increased government spending, AI defense implementation, and increased global travel. As per the report, the global market size of the aerospace and defense sector is estimated to grow from $1 trillion to around $1.5 trillion during the next decade. There are various factors contributing to growth within the industry. Firstly, the defense sector is experiencing significant expansion due to the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine. This rising defense demand resulted in a record defense order backlog of $747 billion, indicating an 11% increase year-over-year. Moreover, the Senate Armed Services Committee has projected that Congress will finalize the FY25 US defense budget at approximately $833 billion, exceeding last year's spending limits. In addition to increased defense spending, which is one segment of the overall aerospace and defense industry, international air traveling is also improving. According to a report by FlightGlobal, the global passenger traffic grew by 7.4% subsequently during the third quarter. Although the profitability of the global airline industry is still down by around $1.7 billion year-over-year, the subsequent growth in passengers indicates an ongoing recovery.

Mitchell Reiss, American diplomat and distinguished fellow at the Royal United Services Institute appeared on a CNBC interview on November 7 to discuss how the defense sector will perform under President-elect Donald Trump. He said that the United States government is expected to increase its defense spending under President Donald Trump. Currently, defense spending is at its lowest level since 1998 and the geopolitical situation is more dangerous than the said year. Reiss thinks that the president will double down on some of the initiatives from his first term. Trump sees China as a United States adversary and he sees Israel and Saudi Arabia as stabilizing forces in the Middle East and will want to build upon the Abraham Accords. He also thinks that the president will call upon its European allies to increase defense spending. While Reiss expects the United States' defense spending to increase, he also noted that a third of the NATO countries are still not hitting the 2% mark in terms of their defense spending. Considering the geopolitical tensions between Russia and Ukraine, European countries would also naturally pivot towards increasing their defense spending. Reiss believes that if someone is interested in defense stocks there is a lot of growth potential within the industry. An aircraft maintenance team in a hanger working on a modern business jet.

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. As a levered bet on Bitcoin, which itself is one of the most volatile assets to ever exist, MicroStrategy (MSTR) shares are in the limelight these days, with investors and analysts alike honing in on the company's ever-increasing BTC holdings, which then serve to precipitate a circular "tail wags the dog" effect on the price of the world's preeminent cryptocurrency. MicroStrategy has acquired 15,350 BTC for ~$1.5 billion at ~$100,386 per #bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 46.4% QTD and 72.4% YTD. As of 12/15/2024, we hodl 439,000 $BTC acquired for ~$27.1 billion at ~$61,725 per bitcoin. $MSTR https://t.co/SaWLNBVkrl — Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) December 16, 2024 In what has, by now, become a fairly predictable pattern, MicroStrategy announced on Monday that it again increased its Bitcoin holdings last week, spending ~$1.5 billion to acquire 15,350 BTC, which increases the size of its total holdings to 439,000 BTC. MicroStrategy's ever-increasing Bitcoin stash in an overall bullish crypto market could unlock a significant milestone for the company in 2025, courtesy of a recent accounting change spearheaded by the FASB. To wit, the FASB's Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 23-08, which went into effect on the 15th of December 2024, posits that entities holding crypto assets must use the fair value (market-based) approach to revalue those assets for each reporting period, with the resulting gains and losses incorporated within the net income for the pertinent period. This means that, in an environment where Bitcoin's price continues to increase in a consistent fashion, MicroStrategy is likely to record significant quarterly gains. BREAKING: Bitcoin hits $107,000, a new all time high. — unusual_whales (@unusual_whales) December 16, 2024 As of the time of writing, Bitcoin has notched another all-time high of $107,000, precipitated by expectations that President-elect Trump will approve a strategic Bitcoin reserve on his very first day in office. Beyond these extrinsic factors, BlackRock recently recommended an optimal multi-asset portfolio allocation of between 1 and 2 percent to Bitcoin. For context, global reserve assets are currently valued at ~$900 trillion. A theoretical 2 percent allocation to Bitcoin can easily boost the cryptocurrency's price to $900,000. The only requirement left for $MSTR to enter the S&P 500 is to have positive earnings over the SUM of the previous 4 quarters. On a theoretical basis once FASB is implemented in Q1 2025 and with a $BTC price of $120,000 and no increase to their $BTC holdings, $MSTR will have… pic.twitter.com/4LJUCweADU — James Van Straten (@btcjvs) December 15, 2024 This brings us to the crux of the matter. For MicroStrategy shares to qualify for an inclusion in the S&P 500 index, the company has to show positive earnings on a cumulative basis for a period that covers the previous 4 quarters. MSTR has yet to satisfy this significant requirement. However, with ASU 23-08 in effect now, and paired with an environment where Bitcoin's price continues to increase, MicroStrategy can show a net income of $25 billion for Q1 2025, which should qualify it for the inclusion in the S&P 500 index, assuming an average Bitcoin price of $120,000 for the period and no additional significant BTC purchases. Bear in mind that the high-flying stock has now been added to the Nasdaq 100 index, unlocking significant passive inflows. Some posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Title: BlackRock Identifies 1% to 2% as Optimal Bitcoin Allocation
URL: https://www.ai-cio.com/news/blackrock-identifies-1-to-2-as-optimal-bitcoin-allocation/
Time Published: 2024-12-16T17:30:50Z

If an institutional investor wants to incorporate bitcoin in a multi-asset portfolio, what is an appropriate allocation? A white paper from the BlackRock Investment Institute, “Sizing bitcoin in portfolios,” identifies a 1% to 2% allocation to bitcoin as reasonable. Any higher, and bitcoin would account for too much risk. The paper stated that a 1% to 2% allocation to bitcoin lifts the digital currency’s share of portfolio risk to 2% to 5%, in line with the average “Magnificent Seven” tech stock, which contributes approximately 4% of portfolio risk, based on current index weights. As bitcoin’s allocation in a portfolio increases, its estimated contribution to risk becomes outsized, compared with those large-cap tech stocks. For example, a 4% allocation to bitcoin would account for 14% of portfolio risk, according to the paper. Therefore, the white paper stated that an allocation to bitcoin of less than 2% would introduce a different source of return and risk, while managing risk exposure. The paper’s authors—Samara Cohen, BlackRock’s CIO of exchange-traded-fund and index investments; Paul Henderson, a senior portfolio strategist; Robert Mitchnick, head of digital assets; and Vivek Paul, global head of portfolio research—wrote that bitcoin cannot be compared to traditional assets and that the main driver of the price of bitcoin will be an increase in adoption. Bitcoin is less correlated with major risk assets in the long term, with a very low correlation between bitcoin and equity returns, the authors wrote. Never miss a story — sign up for CIO newsletters to stay up-to-date on the latest institutional investment industry news.  Institutional ownership of bitcoin could possibly dampen the asset’s volatility, but mass adoption could also dampen future returns, according to the paper. “Broad adoption could also mean bitcoin loses the structural catalyst for further sizable price rises,” the paper stated. “The case for a permanent holding may then be less clear-cut and investors may prefer to use it tactically to hedge against specific risks, similar to gold.” BlackRock noted the high volatility of the asset. Since 2015, there have been six times when bitcoin saw a drawdown of more than 70% from its previous high, including twice—in 2015 and 2019—when the asset had a drawdown of more than 80%. “Taking all this into account, we do see a case for including bitcoin in multi-asset portfolios—provided you believe it will become more widely adopted in the future and are comfortable bearing the risk of potentially rapid price plunges,” the paper stated. Bitcoin is becoming easier to own; several firms, including BlackRock, have launched ETFs which track the price of bitcoin. These bitcoin ETFs have seen $10 billion in inflows since the U.S. election on November 5, according to data from Bloomberg. In total, more than $100 billion has flowed into these ETFs, according to the white paper. Some asset owners have included bitcoin ETFs in their portfolio, including the State of Wisconsin Investment Board, which allocated $160 million to two such ETFs, one from Grayscale and one from BlackRock.

So the Bitcoin revolution, the revolution will be televised. So, starting off. First, what is Bitcoin? Why does it matter? So I think the 1st important critical thing is trying to consider and think you know what is Bitcoin we’ve all heard about in the news we heard about Bitcoin as being a Ponzi scheme, a pyramid scheme. And honestly, my mom has gone through her fair share of Ponzi schemes like she she got suckered by the whole Amway scam. I think the reason why Bitcoin is so important and critical is, Bitcoin is like the early days of the Internet. So if you go into a time machine and you could tell somebody in the past, okay, you know, in the days before email existed. Right? So okay, once one day, you know, everyone’s gonna have a supercomputer in their pocket. They’re using it to check all their bank statements. You’re going to be able to use your camera on your phone to scan your you know your checks, your bank account balances. You can use this to send money and messages and videos to everyone on the planet. Instantly everyone would have thought you were crazy.and I think one of the biggest misconceptions about Bitcoin. So a constructive way of thinking about bitcoin is trying to figure out what bitcoin is not. ￼My personal opinion is, I do not think that Bitcoin is actually cryptocurrency. I think currency is the Us. Dollar, and I think one of the biggest problems about the whole field of crypto and cryptocurrency is everyone is like a crypto anarchist, which means that they want to see the Us. Government and all the governments on the planet fail, and they can essentially live in peace and silent without interference from the Government. Yet, you know, obviously, at the end of the day, it’s nice to have public streets. It’s nice to not get robbed in the streets. And actually, I think one of the biggest misconceptions about Bitcoin is. People think that Bitcoin is trying to replace the Us. Dollar. But my personal thought is, Bitcoin is going to be a supplement to the Us. Dollar. Essentially, I thought this a long time ago that essentially Bitcoin is digital gold to hedge against inflation, which means, as our money, our Us. Dollars, or our euros, or our local currencies become devalued. The upside is, our Bitcoin will become more valuable. I think the best analogy that I got was from chairman of microstrategy mstr Michael saylor, essentially thinking that Bitcoin is is not digital currency, but digitalreal estate. So I think this analogy is better, because nobody’s on their zillow, you know, 20 times a day, checking their home prices right? And this is my mad Max Post Apocalyptic perspective. So imagine the future where there’s, you know, essentiallythere’s this like nuclear fallout. And you know.there’s no inhabitable places anywhere. And let us say, there’s only 21 million single family homes left on the planet for anybody to live. Obviously, sooner or later, you know, people are going to want somewhere to live. And so I think the best analogy, I think, is Bitcoin as digital real estate, which means that with digital real estate. You know, a lot of people are like– I want to quickly make money off of Bitcoin. But how do I make money off of it? It’s kind of like the early days of real estate. So if you bought Manhattan in the 1600s, you know, how do you monetize it? And I still think that we’re in the very, very early days of bitcoin and institutional adoption, which means you’re going to start to see New Bitcoin products come out. So some simple thoughts. So we’ve all heard stories of Scumbag San Francisco based scumbag landlords, you know, charging an arm and a leg for their tenants, and we all hate the landlords, I think with Bitcoin we’ll become the new digital landlords, which means effectively, we will in the future be able to like rent out our Bitcoin. And you know, let’s say we have one bitcoin right, and it’s and then I think that the personal math I like to do in my head is thinking that one Bitcoin is equivalent to one single family home. So I currently live in Los Angeles, in Culver City. It’s kind of insane. A single family home. I’ve even seen some in my neighborhood for 4.4 million dollars. The average Median household single family home is around 1.7 million dollars. So in my personal mind, where I think Bitcoin is a trillion times more valuable than physical real estate land, because you could always make more of it. It’s not a real scarcity. A single family home, and the price of a Bitcoin should be pegged to another. So in my mind I still think of a Bitcoin at least 1.11.7 2.1, maybe even 4.4 million dollars a coin. And I think this is a very very fascinating idea, because also, you know, people say, Oh, but Bitcoin is not real. Money is yeah, but like our dead, shiny rocks. Aka. Gold money either, or is fiat currency, you know pieces of paper. You cannot eat pieces of paper to to live. And I think one of the most interesting things I learned about the philosophy of money is that essentially all money is just existing in the minds and souls of men, the value for men, is all essentially subjective. Money is not “real”, but subjective. Now, what makes Bitcoin so fascinating to me is that it’s the 1st time in human existence, you had a hard cap supply of money. So, for example, people often talk about gold, right? So the issue with gold is at the time it was the least bad form of money, because it was very, very scarce. It was difficult to find. It’s difficult to mine and transport. Yet there was lots of good properties of gold. It’s, you know, essentially it kind of lasts forever. Aesthetically, it looks beautiful, the nice yellow color of gold mimics that of the sun, and you know, at least back in the day, let’s say you had gold coins it could easily fit in your front pocket whatevers. But now things become a lot more difficult because we’re living in the 21st century, the 22nd century you know, we would have flying car drone robo taxi, self driving car waymos. It’s like, Why are we still using an antiquated digital framework of modern day banking swift code accounts? If you’ve ever tried to send money, you know, from the Netherlands to South Korea, to Nigeria, to Lagos whatever you find that the the whole SWIFT system is kind of like a bunch of gangster mafiosas like even my mom is currently living in South Korea. Example if I want to just send my mom a small sum of money, it is insane, ￼ it takes like three or four days, and the wire transfer fees like 55 bucks, I hate this. This should be done instantly. Therefore the thought of bitcoin, being able to quickly and effectively and securely transfer value across time and space without a trusted intermediary is a big big deal, a big big revolution. So why does Bitcoin matter? It’s kind of like asking somebody why does clean water matter so one of the things I love about Michael Saylor, and I highly recommend watching all of his videos. @wsaylor. It’s essentially Twitter or X or michael.com. He uses this analogy of sewer water. So let us say, every all 8 billion people on the planet are all drinking sewer water, and people are dying of dysentery, and people are saying, I don’t get it, you know I exercise, you know. Iyou know I eat healthy exercise every day, but I’m still dying of dysentery. My kids are dying of dysentery, and so the whole issue is that if you’re drinking sewer water, no matter how healthy your lifestyle is, how virtuous you is. It don’t matter. You’re going to be, you know, dying of dysentery, or perpetually sick. And so, if we think about these physiological terms, and apply it to Bitcoin and money and digital capital. This becomes really fascinating because my personal thought and you know, also, I grew up in a family of poverty, poverty, meaning that I thought I was going to be homeless at least 2 or 3 times. My dad was perpetually addicted to gambling with the rent money. So what a lot of people don’t understand about growing up in poverty, and prosody is that the logical strategy that you never know when your dad is going to steal your money and gamble it away, and therefore the smart strategy is actually to spend it all right now! Because you never know when he’s going to look in your piggy bank, your personal checking account that your mom put away for your college, or even take your hard earned $3000 as a 15-year-old bus boy at your mom sushi restaurant, lying that you’re going to invest in some business, leaving to LA for about a month, gambling it away, and coming back empty. When I think about it, this is actually super sad. Once again when I was like super super young like two years old, my mom tried to make me a savings account, like one of those checking or savings investing accounts for kids, and she might’ve had a nominal amount of money in it, like 200 or 250 bucks or something. And she told me the sad news is that one day when she checked up on it she discovered that the money was gone. Essentially my dad even stole away that $250 from my child savings account for college, once again feed his gambling addiction. So once again, as a kid growing up, I never had this ethos or tactic of saving. Because we literally cannot come every dime that my mom made was fun into paying for groceries and rent. Therefore I like a 15-year-old kid, my thought was I’m going to take every single penny, I can immediately go out buying some new sneakers, you know, buy some cool clothes, and I literally had $0 in my bank account. So I think the pernicious, vicious cycle of inflation is. You cannot blame people for not saving up capital for their future if the money itself is deflating at such a rapid pace, and so I personally think that you know Bitcoin is like giving every single person on the planet like unlimited free Fiji water, or the best alkaline hipster water whatever water you want. Essentially giving people clean water. Anda lot of people say, Yeah, but Bitcoin is not real money. It’s a okay. So I think this is a big this is a big shift for me also, personally. My personal thought is, Bitcoin is actually more important than money. So we should not think about money. We should think about capital. I think capital is a lot more robust and strong as a concept. So, for example, capital comes from Cap CAP. Like upon your head. K-ap. Essentially it came from the head of oxen. So if you read the Iliad, the Odyssey essentially, every time you want to appease the gods, you have to sacrifice a hectacomb, Hecta means 100 a hundred head of oxen to appease the gods. And you know, obviously, that’s very expensive, like, can you imagine, if you know you sacrificed a hundred Lamborghinis to appease the gods, it would be quite expensive endeavor. Right? And so, capital. We all live under Capitalism — it doesn’t matter if you’re living in Europe, Africa, Asia, America, China, and also one thing that people don’t understand is, I think, what a lot of these people, maybe 4 or 5 years ago, China is going to take over. China’s not going to take over. China is dependent on America, and effectively, the Chinese Yuan the CNY is essentially effectively pegged to the Us. Dollar and the Us. The US is essentially the world. Reserve currency and capital is what we seek, not money. Talking about currency, so currency is like, you know, buying a Starbucks Frappuccino, or buying a in and out Burger. Right? That’s like money currency, right? Capital is essentially long storm, long term, store of value. So it’s building generational wealth. So one of my favorite songs from Kanye West is the off the grid songs that we off the grid grid grid this for my kid, kids, for when my kids, kids have kids. And I think this is also the big thing is a lot of millennials, nowadays, I think the disincentive to have kids is because there’s so much fear mongering about the the future is gonna become uninhabitable, you know boil the seas or whatever. So there’s not going to be a future. So essentially, there’s a strong sense of pessimism. But Bitcoin, to me is like solidified optimism, which means that the future is going to be glorious and great. And you know, even having Seneca right now, think about his future kids, kids, kids, or my future kids, kids, kids.It brings me so much joy. Because the simple strategy, you just keep stacking Bitcoin until you die, and then you hand it on to your kids. Your kids give it to their kids kids. It’s like, if you owned, you know, a hundred penthouses or 10 square blocks or 20 square blocks in Manhattan, on the main island. Do you ever sell that to buy a Lamborghini? No! That’s not what one does, or liquefy it all into us dollars and brag about how many billions of dollars you have in your bank account. Nope, that’s not the goal– you want to build capital. And traditionally it’s been real estate. But once again, real estate was a good idea. In the 16 hundreds, 17 hundreds, 18 hundreds, 19 hundreds, or 2000s. But then the subprime mortgage meltdown proved that, you know maybe it’s not always the best idea. Real estate can go down. And I think the hard thing is, people say, Yeah, but you know, real estate, you know, essentially, everyone needs somewhere to live, and it’s historically, the value of real estate is always going to go up forever. Now people say that the tricky thing is the pace of monetary inflation is around 15%. The best thing is to either chat Gpt or Google The M2 Money Supply. And essentially what you will find isthat the money supply is essentially a metric in which the Us. Government, or any other government on the planet, includes the euro and stuff. They keep printing more currency. And the reason why then this becomes an issue is that if you have more currency in the system that means the individual value of each unit is going to go down. I call this the shake Shack Burger incident. So me and Seneca we used to always buy a single burger, patty, for $1.49, $1.50 … and one day we come and they say no it is $2.50, a party. Why this makes no sense is like, yeah, we just increased the minimum wage to $20 an hour from $15 an hour. $20 an hour for fast food, and the hard thing is with minimum wage. You cannot rewind the the hands of time. If you suddenly said that the minimum wage is only $17 an hour, there will be riots. The streets would not be not be good. So we’re all photographers, you know, street photographers, whatever. And the hard thing with digital is in our minds, digital is infinite and free. So, for example, I could take a copy of Mozart’s 5th Symphony, or whatever, as an mp3, file, and I could copy and distribute it a trillion times with 0 marginal cost right? So this is where the notion of cyber becomes more interesting. And I’ll think about like, you know, cyber punk thinking about cyber truck. It’s essentially once again, mathematically, cryptographically, that the hard science and the hard math is there can never be more than 21 million coinsin existence come up forever. Even if you took all the quantum ultra computers on the planet, times it by 20, you still could not produce more bitcoins. It’s just how it works right? One Bitcoin is like one cyber-ox, and it’s immortable, immortal, indestructible. It’ll give you life forever. And there’s only gonna be 21 million of them in the future. And now and so this is your chance to get one for an extreme discount. Let’s even say let’s say you want to buy a single family home. Let’s say it costs a million euros or whatever. Right? So if I could tell you today that you could buy a single family home for only $100,000 or €100,000 you’d be like, wow, that’s that’s the deal of a century. That’s you’re still getting a 90% discount. And my personal thought is Bitcoin is far more valuable than real estate, because in the next 20-30 years, when essentially all the all the baby boomers, The Gen. Xers die off, and it’s the millennials and Gen. Z’s. And, alphas! When we millennials take over, what’s interesting is that we don’t really care about physical real estate anymore. We will care about digital cyber real estate which is bitcoin. ￼￼ So my personal story, how did I get into Bitcoin? So it might seem a little bit random. It’s like, Okay, ERIC, you’re super famous for photography, street photography like, how do you get to Bitcoin like? It’s like, so random, right? But actually, it’s not very random at all, because, you know, if you’ve been following me carefully, you know the whole time, I’ve always been talking about living minimalistically, frugally, Spartan lifestyle, whatever’s. And you know now that you know I’m pretty stacked with a bitcoin and microstrategy stock mstr. Funny enough, I’ve personally found that my lifestyle habits haven’t changed much after getting super rich, I mean, I’m a little bit more generous, maybe, like, you know, took out a friend last night to all you eat Korean barbecuepaid for her bill didn’t really even flinch. Even a random aside, my best friend and my best man Justin, told me this when we were like in our early 20s, when we finally got good paying jobs whatever, is that the greatest joy is being able to eat out and not really feel the pain associated with having to eat out because we both grew up poor. ￼ I still remember even when I was undergraduate at UCLA, after our KYRIE club meeting, we would all go out to eat, and then I would see all the other guys ordering these really expensive $15 Korean barbecue gogi plates, (this was in 2006, when you could still buy a foot-long sub sandwich for five bucks￼), and $1.99 tacos, and $1 tacos, and me trying to save money, would force myself not to eat even though I was hungry, and my friends would ask me if I was hungry and I would lie, and say I wasn’t, while my stomach was still grumbling. ￼ So my personal thought with Bitcoin is, I personally wanted monetary freedom, and so long story short, so I’ll never forget this moment. So I’m born 1988. Went to UCLA as an undergrad — my roommate at the time, Kevin. It’s our junior he’s on Reddit, and I’ll never forget we’re in our studio apartment. I think I was distracted. I was doing something else. He was like Eric, you know. He’s on some subreddit, and he’s like. “Oh, Eric, this thing called Bitcoin, and there’s this one dude who just bought two domino’s pizzas for like 10,000 bitcoins. We should just get like a hundred bucks worth of bitcoin, and just see what happens.” I then responded “￼Eh, seems like a scam” and disregarded it. No this is one bitcoin was like less than a penny, so even if me and Kevin and my roommate Kevin, just bought a hundred bitcoins at the time for funsies, right? And I had a hundred bucks right? We would each be worth at least 1.2 billion dollars. If I had bought $100 worth of bitcoin at the time, once again we would each have about $1.2 billion in our checking accounts. Today, I’m like, man. This was like the worst mistake of my life, right? But everything has happened as it should have happened. You know. Maybe if I had become a billionaire I’d just become some degenerate, you know. Cocaine addict on some beach somewhere in in Hawaii, and then Seneca would never been born. I would have never done my photography, world travels, whatevers. Then my reintroduction to Bitcoin was kind of more recently when moving to LA. The cost of living is so expensive, and you know every I don’t know a single person who doesn’t want financial freedom. A long story short, I 1st heard about Bitcoin again, kind of earlier than when I was living in Vietnam around 2017, 2018, and at the time I didn’t really need Bitcoin, because our living expenses were so cheap. It was $320 bucks a month for a brand new studio apartment, fully furnished up, uplighting and the jazz right? And even at the time, passively, the income we’re making. Let’s say it’s a $1000- $2,000 a month. Let’s say it’s not even that much right, but like our whole total expenses, living expenses like maybe $600-700 a month, so I had the epiphany I’m like, I’m never going to run out of money. So already, at the age of 26 in my mind, I mentally retired rightand just more for funsies. I met this guy named Bing in Singapore. Heard about this thing called Digibyte. Dgb, I don’t even think they’re around anymore. But at the time I’m like, Okay, I want to buy some bitcoins, buy some digibyte. How do I do this? And at the time Coinbase seemed like the best option, because it was the simplest, most minimalist to me it looked like the paypal for for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. For fun I bought about $25,000 worth of bitcoin, which, and Bitcoin was only about $7,000, $6,999 a bitcoin. So that was around 3.5 bitcoins. ￼ I then traded some bitcoin for digibyte, and I kept some bitcoin in my Coinbase account. Then the next few years I essentially saw the waves and the crashes and the dogecoins and stuff like that. And essentially, I just kind of woke up to my guts and found out that Bitcoin was a real deal. Some strange analogies is to me Bitcoin is almost like a newWorld economic religion, I mean, people who follow Bitcoin are like fanatic. They’re zealous about it. They follow Michael Saylor like he’s like you know the prophet. You know the next prophet of Bitcoin right? And it’s always good to invest in religions or to invest in cults like the cult of Tesla, Elon Musk apple, Steve Jobs. Whatevs, right? Now obviously, I have financial independence now, and the only reason I’m teaching this workshop or sharing this information is, I almost feel like it’s my ethical imperative. Once again, if you could have discovered internet in the early days, or clean drinking water, I would feel that it would almost be a disservice if I did not share this information with others. So everyone’s always about like, okay, so what is the Bitcoin gonna be worth? So there’s the open source model. Michael Saylor, I think, helped create it. It’s called the Bitcoin 21 model, I think. Right? So 21 years from now his base case is that Bitcoin is going to be $13 million a Bitcoin. Bear case, $3 million a Bitcoin. The bull case is $49 million a Bitcoin, and note, this was in 2024 in July before Trump was announced as President, and he is ultra super pro crypto and bitcoin and also worth following, is his son Eric Trump, ironically. His name is also Eric also the funny thing. There’s a bunch of Eric’s actually in the world of Bitcoin, Eric Kim Eric Semler, of semler scientific, this other Etf guy who works for Bloomberg. His name is Eric Balconus, or something like that. Essentially, we have an all Republican trump, pro bitcoin pro crypto, President and cabinet, whatever right? What is really fascinating about Michael Saylor’s predictions for the future price of bitcoin is that when it was only $65,000 a bitcoin, and we were a bit uncertain about what the future of bitcoin and the president and the government would look like. The last four years, we were all fighting an uphill battle, because the former administration was adamantly anti-crypto and anti-bitcoin. Gary Gensler who seems like a smart guy, was for some reason really anti-bitcoin and crypto? ￼￼ And so these were all written by Michael Saylor’s predictions before we had the most pro bitcoingovernment of all time. So all these numbers, I think, should be inflated. So my personal thought is, I think, for the next 4 years once Trump takes office, January 20, 2025. I think this will be the craziest, best Bitcoin Bull Run of all time the next 4 years. So currently, Bitcoin’s been going up around 60% to 62% arr annual rate of return. And I think once Trump takes office, and I’m pretty sure he’s gonna buy the 1 million Bitcoins, or whatever for the strategic American Reserve. And also I think Eric Trump, his son, is committed to having Bitcoin be at least a million in Bitcoin. So let’s see. So my personal prediction, right? So I think Bitcoin will grow by at least 120% arr over the next 4 years. So let’s say, Bitcoin is worth around $100,000 right now. So by next year, let’s say it’s $250,000 the year after that, let’s say it’s $750,000, let’s say the year after that it’s like $1.2 million. So I think we’re on track to hit a million a bitcoin in 4 years about 10x gain. So just do the math from then. Currently as an account measure, I now equate one bitcoin being worth one cyber truck, assuming that a cyber truck is currently around $100,000. So the smart strategy is to take your hundred thousand dollars and invest it into bitcoin today, and you’ll see that becoming $1 million in four years. ￼ What that means is sell your cyber truck for $100,000, buy bitcoin, otherwise you have just done spent $1 million on your cyber loser truck. Now, people are always asking, okay, this, you know, Bitcoin reserve strategy, you know, like, how is? And why is America going to buy the Bitcoins? Right? So we’re essentially out of physical land and real estate. Now we have to go to cyberspace right? And it seems kind of silly, like something out of a sci-fi film. But the truth is, they’re currently the war we’re having with China and Russia. It’s it’s not physical war per se. It’s actually cyber war. So cyber security is the big big money maker. Even cyber penetration testing. Right? I think Gmail is trying to get like all these malicious actors trying to attack the Gmail servers like a million times a minute. Something crazy, right? And if you look at the history of America, right? So, Manhattan, 1600s, the price of Manhattan. It was essentially stolen from the natives. Right? 60 guilders, right Louisiana purchase, you know, to fund Napoleon, California. Also kind of stolen from the the local Mexicans right? And also Alaska right. The the payoff was great, right, and so essentially the Bitcoin Act, the Cynthia Lummis Bill, she’s trying to get the States to buy at least a million bitcoins right? And you know even a Michael Saylor is much more aggressive. He’s like no America should at least purchase maybe 5 or 6 million bitcoins, which is 20 to 25% of the whole Bitcoin supply. And all America has to do is a free trade. They just need to sell their gold and then buy Bitcoin. And in a recent interview that I was listening from Saylor.super fascinating, is like essentially what he said was the super evil genius strategy of America selling her gold reserves and buying Bitcoin is that if that’s the case,we demonetize our enemies. You know, gold capital reserves. So then suddenly, the the gold of the Russians, the Chinese, will go to 0, and then everyone’s going to rush into Bitcoin. And if America owns Bitcoin, it’s a good sign for the future. And also another big thing I want to talk about. Why does America have the best economy on the planet?So we essentially gave birth to Apple Amazon, Facebook, the magnificent 7 stocks, Netflix. And you know, people talk about China. It’s like. Okay, I don’t know a single rich mainland Chinese oligarch who doesn’t want to send their kids to the States to Harvard or Yale or Princeton, you know, buy a nice house in Palo Alto, the Bay area, or even Vancouver. No rich mainland Chinese person actually wants to be in China, but because of capital controls, they’re kind of stuck. So once there’s going to be a mad rush to Bitcoin. That means that you, your family, your whole squad, is going to prosper now. My friend Dante had a question about storage. So I think the hard thing with storage is okay. So how do you say this?This is my personal philosophy. The reason I do not personally trust cold storage for myself or more of these self custody options is that I know that I am very forgetful, and my biggest fear is, let’s say, I forget my passcode, or whatever is right to the Bitcoins. And or let’s say, my kids, kids can forget it right? Then boom like, you’re gonna be out like a hundred 1 million dollars. Right? So that’s that’s not fun, right? And so personally, I think the easiest is to just, you know, store it on the cloud. So, using a trusted custodian, whether it be coinbase. I think fidelity has their own services now. And the you know honestly, it seems like Coinbase is probably the best option,,, coinbase.com, or you just download your iphone ipad. Whatever right is that you could also get a link with your biometric apple id data, whether it be face id or thumbprint. Whatevs right? So this way, it just feels much more secure. So for me, I would prefer an 80 to 85% optimal thing that is kind of dummy proof rather than take the 100% secure option which, because of user error, I might fail, and something that I personally learned is in terms of technology. And all these things in betweenseeking the simplest, most straightforward optionthat is least complicated is often the best solution. And the reason I would be very, very wary of a lot of these people promoting, you know, buying their hardware wallets. Whatever right, everyone has a buck to make. Everyone has a bitcoin to make. Everyone wants to make a few satoshis here and there. So they’re trying to fear monger us. Oh, you’re gonna you know, Coinbase going to get hacked. And I’m like, no, I don’t think it is. It’s like, you know, back. It’s like essentially a Us. Government backed institution, you know, it’s essentially it’s traded on the the the US Stock Exchange. It’s a American based company. I would not trust anything outside of the States. If you’re super, you know, quant genius, autistic genius, then do all the cold storage stuff. But if in doubt, just the simplest thing is, coinbase seems to be the best. Okay, so this is kind of my free money hack. So I call this microstrategy, strategy, mstr microstrategy versus bitcoin. And okay, so it’s very, very simple. So this becomes a philosophical debate. To say it short.I think the ultimate goal is to own Bitcoin, he or she, or the entities which own the most Bitcoin shall win. And so for me, philosophically, you know, let us say that you could own, you know, 20 bitcoins, or you could own 2 million dollars worth of micro strategy. Mstr. Stock. Right?10-20, 30 years from now, right? With MSTR you’re going to actually outperform Bitcoin. You’re actually going to make more money from microstrategy stock than Bitcoin. So Bitcoin, historically, has been 60% to 62% ARR annual rate of return MicroStrategy is almost double that 120 to 125 ARR. So if you actually want to maximize your returns, you just buy microstrategy stock mstr. The issues is, you know let us say that Michael Saylor gets shot. He gets killed. He dies in a Cybertruck self driving accident whatever. Right? Then, it’s probably not going to be the world’s best future for microstrategy. So it’s actually much more risky. If you want the least risky option, just put all your money into Bitcoin. And some millennial living strategies. Right? So the the simplest strategy I have, I call it the Spartan strategy. This is why I personally follow. Is you essentially try to live as minimally and frugally and sparse as you can, and just put literally 90% of your income into bitcoin. And a free money hack I discovered. So, for example, let’s say you have $150,000 or €150,000. Right? And you know I’m not 100% sure how it works if you’re a European. Anyways what you do is you buy microstrategy stock. So let’s say you buy, you know, $100,000 or $150,000 worth of it right? And Mstr, and you use fidelity, or robinhood, or whatever trading app you have. Right. And the strategy is simple. Let us say the base case is $150,000. Let’s say your microstrategy stock value then goes up to $200,000. Right?You sell $50,000 worth of it, and then you just transfer that to your bank account, and then your bank account is linked with your coinbase account. Then you just buy the Bitcoin — rinse and repeat. So very, very impressive over the last 3 months, I started with initial seed capital of around $150,000 in microstrategy stock, off of that $150,000 right and I haven’t even touched my principal. I yielded $242,000off of that initial $150,000. Once again I didn’t touch any of my principal. So essentially I made a free $240,000 dollars … in just 3 months! And also for traditional Roth, Roth, Ira retirement accounts. I put everything into microstrategy stock, and it had already like 3x’d. For example, My roth, Ira, just kind of randomly was like was $78,000, and then the course of 3 months it’s like now, $230,000. It peaked at around $300,000. So it’s going to be a good future. So the the very simple strategy– cut and reduce your expenses to a bare minimum. ￼So let us say you’re able to get down your living expenses to let’s say you know, $5,000 bucks a month or €5,000 a month. Right? the point isn’t to just make a bunch of money and just go out and buy the Lambo. The the goal is actually to continue to live frugally. If anything live more frugally. So the funny paradox here is that when people say they want to become a millionaire, but they’re really mean to say is I want to spend $1 million. ￼ But the funny thing is the second you go out and you spend $1 million, you then become worth zero dollars. So actually, the game then is to stack your capital indefinitely and to see your numbers go up forever. And then the hilarious thing assuming that you’re like some sort of greedy money rich person, you actually continue to live as frugally as possible, and not touch your capital. ￼￼￼ I think one of the wise ways to think about money is like heat loss. For example, if you’re super effing cold, do you want to seal up the window windows and the spots of your house which loses heat. The same thing is with money and capital. You want to stop the capital loss. ￼So for example, the number one thing is the whole vehicle thing!￼ Never ever ever ever ever purchase any vehicle that requires premium gas. This is like the stupidest mistake of all time.￼ You continue driving your old Toyota Prius, and just pour all of your money in Bitcoin, because really the truth is and this is my philosophical thought is, there’s almost nothing worth on the planet purchasing.Besides, Bitcoin is my philosophical thought. The only thing worth purchasing on the planet is bitcoin. ￼ ￼Also some even more super smart economic leverage. Instead of paying an arm and a leg for rent in La or New York. Brooklyn, you just move to like Southeast Asia. So if you move to Southeast Asia, you can live like a king, for like $300-500 bucks a month. Right? You just put all your money to Bitcoin. So even if you had a modest savings, right, let’s say you had like $200,000, and you have microstrategy stock.Let’s say every month of the month is rent is due, and the expenses are due right? You just sell a small portion of that stock, and it’s going to go up. So my thought on the next 4 years, microstrategy, assuming it’s around 2x Bitcoin. I think Bitcoin is going to go up 120% ARR. I think microstrategy is going to double that 240% ARR. So just do the math. At the end of every single month in which expenses are due, let us say it’s like $1000 bucks or something… You just sell $1000 worth of bitcoin or microstrategy stock to just afford your lifestyle. ￼ But ultimately my personal thought is whatever excess, money and capital you have just put it onto Bitcoin. So the microstrategy then ends up becoming the engine or the turbocharger or the cash cow. You milk it, and you shave the cream off the top, and then you buy Bitcoin with it. So I think the reason why to me Bitcoin is such a fascinating thing, and very exciting, is essentially Bitcoin is digital photography. Peter Diamandis, the X prize guy. Right? You know, he talks a lot about kodak film. You know the iphone and disruption.So actually, intuitively, as photographers and digital photographers, we should actually understand bitcoin. You know, this disruptive power about digital photography. So obviously, you have the hipsters with their mustaches and their flannels, you know, talking about the virtues of film photography. But the truth is, digital photography is like a quadrillion times better than film photography. And also currently, in the year 2025, incomingdigital photography is actually superior to film photography. In the early days of digital ,,, digital photography sucked. But now, at this point, digital photography is far superior to any sort of film photography, and the only reason you should shoot film in today’s world is either as like a practice to appreciate the joys of photography. So the philosophical approach. Or you know, you’re trying to be some sort of like, you know, snobby fine art photographer and overcharge money for your photos. Then you shoot film.Because honestly, the the fine art market, they’re always going to overvalue film photos over digital photos, because it’s more complicated. It’s more strange, right? So in the art, in the art world, the more complicated, abstruse, and complicated, you can make your art the better. But for us,where we care about practical things, yeah, think about Bitcoin. So think about the iphone iphone pro versus your mom’s kodak Browning camera. I think the the thought is obvious. Okay. Very simple. Just download the coinbase app. Buy Bitcoin. If you don’t want to actually own Bitcoin, you just want to make a ton of money, just buy microstrategy stock MSTR, and use your traditional accounts. And I still think that this is the biggest thing is that everyone wants to become a millionaire, right?But you know what I think people want to do isthey don’t want to earn like, okay, okay.people want to spend a million dollars.They don’t want to actually save and build a million dollars right? And so if you think about, you know, money andcapital digital capital, I think about like Lego bricks, right? I just went to Legoland. Senecall is great. So let us say thateach bitcoin, or dollar or 1 million dollars like these. Let’s say these are Lego bricks right? The goal is, you want to build your Lego Tower brick thing as tall as possible. You don’t ever want toget rid of your bricks and throw into the trash. That’s essentially what consumerism is. And this is actually another big philosophical thing I discovered is, what’s the difference between capitalism and consumerism. Consumerism is actually the exact opposite of capitalism. Capitalism is about accumulating wealth.building your capital and not spend it right. Even one of my favorite Kanye quotes is like why people make money don’t spend it. But I’d rather buy 80 gold chains go ignorant, right ignorant. And so the pernicious thing that happens in a lot of communities, especially poor communities. Right? I’ve seen this happen with my own eyes. Right?Happens to Korean people. It happens to everybody, right? Is that you know you live in a crappy apartment in K. Town with 20 other dudes. Yet you drive the brand new Bmw. And you’re not building any sort of generational wealth. Right? And so essentially, yeah, you want to build the capital and not spend it. And essentially, you want to start to intelligently leverage your capitalto give to your future kids or your descendants, or whatever you want to do. Now, the hardest thing about Bitcoin is stomaching the volatility so volatile, mean. Just it goes up, it goes down, and then, like honestly for most people, it’s going to give them like 5. 100 heart attacks over right nowI think of a Bitcoin kind of like nuclear energy, sonuclear energy in the untamed formed is obviously toxic could cause the next Fukushima whatevers right? But if you have a bunch of smart people, engineers, nuclear physicists working in a controlled manner, right? It’s like the greatest benefit to society, because to humanity, because essentially, you’re giving people free electricity forever. Right? AndI think my personal thought is the volatility is a future not above. So the reason why Bitcoin goes up and down the sideways so much all the time, and you can have huge swingsis because you could trade a 24, 7, 365 on the weekends in the evenings. Right?It still befuddles me that in the year 2024, 2025 like. Why is it that you know, after 5 pm. You know Eastern time, or on the weekend Saturday, Sunday like, why did they close the market? So what if there’s another Cuban missile crisis. It makes no sense right?And also the reason why it’s so volatile is that it’s actually the mostdesirable commodity on the planet. And there’s all these people with these weird Bloomberg machine terminals, whatever they are, always pegging everything to the Bitcoin. So a lot of people ask about ethereum dogecoin webs, right. I think Bitcoin is the only true.Everything else is the false prophets. Everything else is the false coins. The immaculate conception of Bitcoin and Satoshi.I think this is actually a big deal, because anything that is not Bitcoin, you know, ethereum and the like. They they need some sort of spokesperson, or, you know, individual to prop up the value right, whereas Satoshi, he invented it, he disappeared forever. Now the reason why this is such a big deal is thatevery other crypto thing which is not Bitcoin.It does not have a hard caplike you could print more ethereums. You could print more. Whatever tokens you cannot print more bitcoins, and that’s that’s the big thought.So. Volatility is vitality. Eric Kim. I actually didn’t say that. Sorry. That was actually Michael Saylor. I typed that in wrong. But essentiallyyou know, volatility is vitality, and the more volatile the more energy the power you have, the more vitality you have. So once again, people think of volatility as being risk. That is actually not the case. Bitcoin is going to go up forever, but it’s going to be like an extreme roller coaster and go up down, but with extreme swings it’s extreme performance. Soyeah, volatility is not risk. Volatility is just going up and down a lot, but essentially over a long enough time span. It’s going to go up forever.So I borrowed a lot of slides quite liberally from Michael Saylor. Some of these are from his recent Microsoft. Pitch. And yeah, just go. michael.com go to his presentations looking at yourself. So I’ll just make some quick points. Soessentially, currently, Bitcoin is like a 2 trillion dollar asset class right? And this is also from Jesse Myers once in a species.com. And the reason why this is important is currently you know. Let us say the whole world’s economy is 900 trillion dollars, right? Andwhat we have our eyes on is real estate. So real estate is, you know, most people don’t really just use real estate as a place to live right? Otherwise, you just rent. People use it for a long term store of value. So, for example, if you’re a really really rich family from New York City, you own, like 10 square blocks in Manhattan, and, you know, does your descendants sell, you know.a square block to buy himself a few Ferraris. No, that that would be a bad strategy. So the the tip I have for any single person trying to build intergenerational wealth. Keep it simple. Only one rule. You don’t sell the Bitcoin. If you face extreme poverty or financial distress, I don’t know. Become an Uber driver or something. Pay the bills, but don’t sell the Bitcoin.and currently I think we’re going to see is Bitcoin is just going to take over the gold market, which is 16 trillion dollars, maybe the cars and collectible art market.Now, a big thought is this is from Michael Saylor once again, is thatall these assets on the planet.Some of half of it is to provide utility. Right? So, for example, you know.let’s say you need you need somewhere to live right? No so that provides utility right? But then, again, some of it is to preserve capital right? Andas a 36 year old millennial nowadays. The pressures. Oh, you got to buy a single family home today, right? But the the reason I get so sus of people saying you should buy a house is that they’re like, oh, you essentially need somewhere to live. You’ll build capital. Blah! Blah, right? You don’t want to give money to land, but it’s like no, you only need one reason like you would only ever buy a single family house. If let’s say you really like having a backyard and a garage, or what is right. But it’s really nota money making thing, because homeownership is like a trillion, times more expensive than you would otherwise think, and as a consequence, with a single family home, even if the price is going up rightat best, you might be breaking, even if not, you know, slowly bleeding yourself. Because, let’s say, real estate is on average, going up 10% a year, right? The money supply the inflationary. M 2 supply is 15% a year. So you’re actually kind of losing money.So the big thought is once again, you know.the optimistic thought is eventually all these long term sort of things are going to become digital capital. I still think about this, the Warren Buffett. They’re all gonna die. And then, when we, you know, take the take the mantle. What’s gonna happen the next 20 years, even if you’re 80 years old right now? 81 years old. Shout out.You know, I think I’m optimistic. We could live to be 100 20. So yeah, this is definitely the next wave. You’re not going to want to miss right? And you know, currently a lot of millennials. People like everyone wants to buy the Lambo or the Ferrari.You’re you’re going to lose the value of it in about 3 years. You want to live forever.So these are some kind of conservative growth estimates, according to Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin 24 model. So in about 21 years, and this was still pretty conservative. Right? Bitcoin is going to become a 280 trillion dollar, you know thing right? So going from 2 trillion to 200 trillion, so at least 10 x. So you’re conservatively, you’re going to see your money at least 10 x in 21 years, which is pretty cool. Right? It’s not going to take over all these other things. It might, but it might not.Now people always ask.what is Bitcoin backed by? So I did the maths right and based on what other people say, too essentially the Bitcoin network. If you took all the apple Amazon aws servers, Meta.combine them all times 20, you could still not hack the Bitcoin network in in terms of the raw power that goes into powering. Think about like 20 nuclear power reactors powering the thing right? And also people don’t understand is there’s already been 850 billion dollars of quote, real money investment thing follow Blackrock. They just recently recommended most of theiryou know, owners to allocate at least 2% of their portfolio into Bitcoin, which is kind of a big deal. Look about what Larry Fink says. Blackrock is like what they own. What 40 trillion dollars of assets around the planet. They’re they’re kind of a big deal. And also it’s a network effect. So you remember, in the early days of Facebook. It was only it was only university students with the Edu address were allowed to join in. Then they opened up to everybody, and the network effect of Facebook is thatif you have Facebook and I have Facebook, then Facebook instantly becomes more valuable to both of us, because I can now share my photos with you, whatever’s right. But then, if your friends friends also have Facebook, it becomes much more valuable to everything. Same thing goes with facetime right. The reason why I got you know I used to be a Diehard android dude. Now I’m like all icloud everything. It makes life so much easier. You get your mom an iphone. Now you get facetime imessage. It makes life way better.And so Bitcoin is going to be the same thing as more and more people are going to continue to download Coinbase or Whatevs. And also my optimistic thought is, if Apple doesn’t want to become irrelevant, it’s I’m very certain the next 5 to 10 years. Apple is going to have their ownBitcoin storage thing in your icloud account. It makes sense right. They have apple pay. They have the apple wallet. Essentially.apple is the new bank. And so now, when they do like a you know, a 3 device authentication for your bitcoins through your iphone, your ipad and your macbook pro whatevers.It’s actually it might actually be one of the most safe ways to store your bitcoins.Also things to think about. If you’re a traditional investorso there’s this notion called the cost to capital cost to capital that Michael Saylor says a lot. I might be getting this wrong. Butessentially the S. And P. 500 right?on average, is like 14 to 15% return year over year. Right? So if you’re not making at least 15% or over 15% a year, you’re essentially losing your bleeding money. So real estate gold bonds is kind of a losing bet, right? And so the magnificent 7 which all the big tech stocks 28%, a little bit better, right? But look at Bitcoin. It’s like 62% year over year. And it’s kind of the obvious bet, right?And even if you think about you know, everyone’s talking about Nvidia Tesla. You know what is right.I think the reason why the mainstream media they don’t like to talk about micro strategy is that it’s still a little bit too weird and bizarre. And it’s not as buzzworthy as AI, because, okay, people like to think of this like evil Terminator AI, the video going to take over the world and find it right. But nobody is like Bitcoin, likeBitcoin is not an android walking around 2 feet, taking over the planet right? So people actually don’t like to talk about Bitcoin. And for so long people thought that Bitcoin was a Ponzi scheme right. No one ever thought that AI was a Ponzi scheme. So the video always catches the headlines. But look at microstrates, look at the best performing stock on the human unit in the human universeover 3 x. That of Nvidia, which is already impressive, and Nvidia is already destroying Tesla by a massive margin as well. Right? SoI mean? That’s that’s pretty obvious, right?Even Donald Trump watches a Nashville presentation. He quotes Michael Saylor directly, says, Never sell your Bitcoin. Apparently Eric Trump, the son of Donald Trump has known Michael Saylor for 20 years. I’m not sure if that’s true or not, but if that’s the case.I’m like a hundred percent certain that. You know, Michael Saylor essentially has the left ear of Donald Trump.And yeah, it’s it’s a it’s a very good thing.So if you want to plug and create your own models. Google, the Bitcoin, 24 model. It’s on Githubplug in your own assumptions.And this is the big thing that I have my eyes set on. So currently, you know, it’s December right? And everyone’s waiting for the trump to get into the office January 20.th So this is a tricky thing. So I used to be Super Anti Donald Trump, right? Because I could care less about politics and stuff like that right? Andbutone Donald Trump became super super pro bitcoin. I started to listen and start watching all his interviews and looking like honestly the you know, I’m from the Bay Area like Liberal Democrat, my whole life right? And actually, I kind of realized, wow, the the left leaning media is kind of the they’re kind of the evil ones here. And Donald Trump, he seems actually kind of like a cool, nice nice nice guy, right?And the big thought is.there’s no, there’s not going to be a World war 3. What is right? And Bitcoin, under the trump administration is gonna explode, and it’s gonna be thethe greatest 4 years of prosperity of all time, and this once again coming from like a super left leaning liberal. So this is a good thought so. Anyways. Let us say, you know.America leads the charge in the crypto Bitcoin revolution. Right? And yeah, I thinkassuming that America really wants to control the future. I think the America purchasing 6 million bitcoins is not fully out of this this planet. Right?So some thoughts on building personal family wealth.So the reason why I think this is kind of a big deal is thateveryone wants to build wealth right. Everyone wants to be intelligent with their investing. It doesn’t matter if you’re a nonprofit, a charity, a church, Mother Teresa, like every single organization, will always need money. Capital. If you have an endowment, you know, for Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stanford Brown University. Whatever even the Uc. Is right, everyone needs money and capital right.and I don’t like to think too much about the macro, because I’m not an institutional investor. I just think about myself, my family, my best friends, my squad. Right? So the goal is building personal family wealth and how to intelligently invest. So a lot of people talk about timings. Oh, when should I buy Bitcoin? Should I time it the high. Then people take out these charts and these candlesticks, which is all just witchcraft and pseudoscience don’t follow any of that.Essentially the thought is.anytime is a good time to buy Bitcoin if it’s high, low, Middle, whatever. We’re going to keep buying the top forever. So recently I bought some more Bitcoin at $100,000. Right then it dipped down to 90,000 to 88,000 hit 103,000 again, and so I’m pretty sure that in 1020 years I’m going to be buying Bitcoin at 1 million, a Bitcoin, 10 million dollars a Bitcoin, 55 million dollars a Bitcoin, whatever is right, and because if you do the simple math, just think at least 4 years ahead, right? So if I could tell you with 100 certainty that Bitcoin is going to be 1.2 million a Bitcoinin 4 yearsas long as you’re buying it for less than a million dollars a coin. You’re going to be in the green like it’s it’s kind of a a good bet, right? And actually, also, ironically, my personal thought ischasing gains is a good thing, but also it’s it’s a good idea to not get quote greedy in the sense of maximizing your gains. So so, for example, right like, what’s the difference between getting a 38% yield and a 32% yield like the the difference is nominal. Don’t don’t worry so much about maximization, because even a lot of what I thought my trades were bad2 years ago ended up being right. So as investors, we have to think at least 410-20-3040 years ahead of us. So don’t worry so much about the the short termso practical and pragmatic investing strategies right? So once again, so if I had a simple blueprint, sosome some simple thoughts.there’s lots of different blends. You could do this, you could. You could be super simple. Just 100 to Bitcoin, buy it on Coinbase what is right, and just keep stacking forever.100 legitimate. That’s the Bitcoin Maximus opposed the triple, triple Maxi, the triple Maximalist approach. If you just need to pay the bills whatever, and still stack the Bitcoins. My personal suggestion is put 80% of your wealth into Bitcoin and 20% of your wealth into micro strategy Mstr stock. And once again. This is this is what you do. So let’s say, for simplicity of math. Let’s sayLet’s say you have a million dollars or a hundred $1,000, or you use whatever kind of a number you want, right? So put 20% that to microstrategy stock whenever it goes upbeyond the principal, sell some of that stock and put that into micro strategies. Sorry. Put that into Bitcoin, and or use that money to just pay your your bills. So once again what I personally did right?$150,000 working capital into micro strategy Mstr stock. And let’s say, when it goes from worth $150,000 to $160,000. I’ll sell $10,000 worth that stock. That $10,000 gets deposited to my checking account, which is linked to my coinbase. Then I’ll just buy $10,000 worth of bitcoin right? Or, if you need that, $10,000for living expenses. Let’s sayyou need $3,000 to pay your rent. You take $3,000 of that to pay your rent, and you put the other 7% of that into Bitcoin.also some other definition. What’s the difference between being an investor, a trader versus speculator?So an investor, we want to be investors. We want to think about (102) 030-4050 years ahead of us. A trader is a bunch of these, like 20 year old. High testosterone degenerates, you know, single, you know, maybe addicted drugs, or whatever right, who just want to like look cool. I made a billion dollars in a month by using all these complicatedstatistical models. Blah! Blah! Right? But you don’t. You don’t want to be a trader because essentially it’snobody could time the market. Not even God could time the market right. And what a speculator is people who invest in meme coins. So a meme coin is like buying a Dogecoin or shiba Inu, that the reason why these are not you should not do this is that it is extremely dangerous. You’re going to lose all your money, and it requiresa charismatic leader to support it. So Dogecoin, right? Dogecoin is essentially elon musk coin right?But if one day Elon musk tweets. Ha! Ha! Doge was just a joke all along, right. It’s not worth anything. The value of it will pump it to 0, or if once again. Elon dies in a you know a robo taxi accident. The value of dogecoin is going to go to 0, whereas if Elon Musk dies, you know Bitcoin is going to still keep going up forever. So speculator is meme coins beyond bitcoin us Bitcoiners. We’re we’re investors.So you know, somebody also asked about, you know, monetary inflation right? So there’s this thing called the M. 2 monetary supply of the the rate rate inflation.And once again you’re going to have to exceed at least 13% to 15% tonot lose money. So, for example, let us say, you have a billion dollars of us dollars in your checking account. Right? You’re going to be bled to death. Right? So in a year, your 1 billion dollar is going to shrink to 750 million down to 500 million, to 350 million. And essentially, you’re going to get a point where your money is worthless.And already we see this right now. So currently, the price of real estate, single family homes is exploding. But this is my critical view. How much of that is that the value of a single family house is higher versus our Us. Dollars are just simply worthless. Right? So if you just do the same simple maths, right?So let us say that. You know, minimum wage goes from $15 an hour to $20 an hour overnight for Mcdonald’s worker. Right? That means instantly. You see, 25% inflation. So your 1 million dollars in the bank is now worth only 750$1,000. So yeah, once again. The real real rich people. They store less than 1% of their wealth inUs. Dollars in their checking account like, you’re not gonna have Jeff Bezos bragging to other people that he has 10 billion dollars of us dollars in their checking account. No, it’s it’s all going to be in you know, stocks, or, you know, real estate. And actually, ideally, Bitcoin. Cyber cyber capital.So yeah, that’s that’s essentially the the end of my presentation. When in doubt, just buy more Bitcoin! ALL OPEN SOURCE EVERYTHING! EK IDEAS

© 2024 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy As Marc Norman, associate dean of NYU’s SPS Schack Institute of Real Estate, kicked off the proceedings for Commercial Observer’s second annual Breakthrough Awards Breakfast, he neatly summarized the depth of the challenges faced by all those nominated for these awards — and, for that matter, for all who endeavor to close deals and create new properties in an industry that has been besieged by obstacles in recent years. “The deals nominated today represent for me and our students at Schack an amazing series of case studies in how complex transactions get done in a dynamic political, policy, and economic environment,” said Norman. “The structure of this event is something I love, because it shows us excellence across all asset classes and sectors, deal sizes, and financing types. This crew of finalists represents a kind of best-in-class, and shows us the way in innovating and moving forward in a very tough market — really the toughest market — New York City.” And this, illustrating the resilience and ingenuity at the heart of the industry, is in many ways the primary purpose of the Breakthrough Awards. “Our Commercial Observer Breakthrough Awards have become an important way of recognizing and celebrating the critical deals, transactions, projects and teams that are leading the industry forward despite market challenges,” said Observer Media CEO James Freiman. “In a challenging economic landscape, it’s easy to get distracted by the many hurdles the industry faces, but each of the Breakthrough Award finalists and winners have demonstrated best-in-class work and the innovation and ingenuity needed to overcome those obstacles.” The prestige of these awards had a clear and marked impact on all those nominated. “Knowing that Rosenberg & Estis is recognized along with other top-notch law firms as one of the elite firms representing the real estate industry, in what is a very competitive business and in the world’s most competitive city, is at the same time gratifying and humbling,” said Michael E. Lefkowitz, managing member at Rosenberg & Estis, one of the evening’s nominees for Law Firm of the Year. “These types of industry recognition events are excellent opportunities to showcase Rosenberg & Estis’ talents, and well as to get to know a bit more about the amazing achievements and successes of other players in the real estate industry.” Kicking off the evening’s deals and transactions segment, the night’s first award, for Retail Transaction of the Year, went to Kushner, Fortress Investment Group, GreenBarn Investment Group, and Rithm Capital for their $415 million financing of Monmouth Mall in Eatontown, N.J. The financing will be used to transform the former mall into an open-air town center featuring 900,000 square feet of retail and restaurant space. “I want to thank our partners Fortress and GreenBarn on our amazing Monmouth Square project in Eatontown,” said Kushner CEO Laurent Morali. “And to our amazing team at Kushner, represented here by so many, I love all of you and I love working with all of you. Thank you so much.” Industrial Transaction of the Year was awarded to Turnbridge Equities, Dune and Cushman & Wakefield for Otto Environmental Systems’ 61,000-square-foot lease at 807 Bank Street in Brooklyn. “Biggest thanks to Turnbridge and Dune for their incredible collaboration in bringing this innovative, eco-friendly solution to life,” said Rico Murtha, a managing director at Cushman & Wakefield. “With its forward-thinking design and low carbon footprint, this breakthrough embodies the future of sustainable technology in industrial facilities. We are thrilled for Otto to commence its war on rats in the streets of NYC!” Residential/Multifamily Transaction of the Year, intended to recognize the breakthrough deal or transaction advancing the residential and/or multifamily markets, was awarded to Blackstone and Wells Fargo. The award represented the latter’s role as buy-side M&A adviser and lead financing provider for Blackstone for the $10 billion acquisition of AIR Communities, which included a $2.65 billion term loan and $4 billion in SASB CMBS transactions. Life Sciences Transaction of the Year was awarded to Breakthrough Properties for its 15-year, 230,000-square-foot lease with Pfizer Oncology at the premier life sciences campus Torrey View in San Diego. “In this transaction,” said NYU’s Norman, “Pfizer drives its commitment to accelerating breakthroughs for cancer patients utilizing two state-of-the-art facilities at these buildings.” Then, a special award for Structured Debt Transaction of the Year was presented to Blackstone. “In March of this year, Blackstone Real Estate Debt Strategies acquired a $1 billion performing senior mortgage loan portfolio from German lender Deutsche PBB,” said Norman. “The portfolio consists of 11 loans secured against performing multifamily, office and hospitality assets across the U.K. and U.S. Blackstone Real Estate Debt Strategies acquired the entire portfolio on an all-cash basis. So we want to congratulate the team at Blackstone for the 2024 Structured Debt Transaction of the Year Breakthrough Award.” Shifting the focus to specific projects, the Sustainability Project of the Year was awarded to Bank of America for its financing of a $35 million construction loan for The Helios Project, a transformative, solar-powered, 186-unit affordable housing development in Virginia’s Henrico County. “Bank of America was thrilled to work with the Spy Rock Real Estate Group and Crescent Development team on an innovative project that will help revitalize Richmond by delivering much-needed high-quality housing,” said Sam Buzzelli, vice president of community development banking for Bank of America. “The Helios will feature an on-site solar array that generates solar power to operate the property while eliminating tenants’ electricity costs. This was our first project with the development team, but we’re glad to already be working together again.” The award for Adaptive Reuse Project of the Year, awarded for “the repurposing of a building that’s designed to, or has resulted in, a positive impact for the greater real estate community,” according to Norman, went to GFP Real Estate and TPG Real Estate for acquiring and transforming 222 Broadway from a 750,000-square-foot office tower into an 800-unit residential building. Norman referred to the winning project as “an amazing example of adaptive reuse.” “We are deeply honored to receive Commercial Observer’s 2024 Breakthrough Award for Adaptive Reuse Project of the Year alongside our partner, TPG, for our work on 222 Broadway,” said Brian Steinwurtzel, co-CEO and principal of GFP Real Estate. “This recognition is a testament to our shared vision and dedication to reimagining and revitalizing urban spaces. Thank you to Commercial Observer for this prestigious recognition, and congratulations to all the other winners who are shaping the future of our industry.” Design and Development Project of the Year was awarded to Pacific Retail Capital Partners for developing District Galleria, a $2.5 billion transformation of a regional shopping mall into a dynamic mixed-use, transit-oriented district in White Plains, New York. The Public-Private Partnership of the Year award then went to RXR and the City of New Rochelle for the opening of the luxury residential tower Two Clinton Park in New Rochelle, N.Y. “Thanks to Commercial Observer for recognizing this public-private partnership,” said Joseph Graziose, executive vice president of RXR, where he is head of construction and development. “It’s being awarded in 2024, but it’s 10 years in the making, a true testament to what the private and public sectors can do when they put their heads together.” Next up, Tech Advance of the Year was awarded to Savills for the development of the generative AI tool Savills GPT, which was developed in collaboration with OpenAI. “Thank you so much for the recognition for this, especially amongst such wonderful and amazing technology partners,” said Sarah Dreyer, executive vice president and chief information officer at Savills. “We’re really taking a collaborative and innovative approach to what we’re doing with our AI with our technology partners, and we’re excited to share more about it.” The next three awards rewarded firms advancing key asset classes through innovative approaches to design, development, financing and marketing. The award for Innovation in Residential went to Avdoo & Partners Development for the development of Bergen, a residential building designed by Taller Frida Escobedo and featuring 105 residences along with 14,513 square feet of indoor and 11,943 square feet of outdoor amenities. “We’re really excited to be part of such a strong group of peers that were nominated for this award today,” said Krystyn Gatto, Avdoo’s COO. “As you all know, it takes a great deal of effort from a really strong team to be able to make these projects come to life. It was a really unique opportunity to have 400 feet of linear frontage in Brooklyn, which is not very common, and create an urban oasis. Thank you so much for the award.” The Innovation in Industrial Award went to Alterra IOS, the investment platform for Alterra Property Group, for the redevelopment of 6110 Passyunk Avenue in Southwest Philadelphia from a 5-acre industrial outdoor storage site into a state-of-the-art soil remediation facility. The Innovation in Office Award then went to RXR for its RXO tenant experience program. “The RXO program is about elevating the tenant experience,” said Dave Gise, senior vice president and head of hospitality and amenities at RXR. “I wish my entire team was here today with me, but they’re actually elevating the tenant experience on site. So thank you. This means a lot.” The team awards kicked off with Gensler winning as the Top Architecture Team of the Year for its work on projects including Disney’s new headquarters, Google’s St. John’s Terminal, and IBM’s flagship office in New York. “It’s really our pleasure and honor to be a part of such an amazing world-class real estate community, and to help rebuild the fabric of New York,” said Amanda Carroll, managing director and principal at Gensler. “We’re really proud of our physical impact on the city of New York.” Top CRE Financier of the Year (Banks) was awarded to J.P. Morgan Chase based on more than $120 billion in multifamily loans, over $22 billion committed to affordable housing, and $173 billion in total commercial real estate loans in 2024. “We’ve carved out a unique niche as a development lender — a transitional lender — in an area which a lot of banks are not competing in these days, and we’re trying to fend off a lot of these non-bank lenders who are here today to be recognized as well,” said Jeremy Hellinger, a managing director at J.P. Morgan Chase. “We appreciate the amazing team and amazing clients that made this easy.” As a perfect follow-up to his comment, the award for Top Financier of the Year on the Non-Bank side went to Tyko Capital for projects including the provision of the $357 million construction loan for the Flatiron Building conversion project, a $527 million loan for the St. Regis Residences in Miami, and a $555 million long-term, permanent loan for 830 Brickell, Miami’s first new stand-alone office tower in over a decade. “We started in the advisory business as an unknown commodity 14 years back,” said Adi Chugh, Tyko’s founder & CEO. “And I got up one day and said, ‘We’re done with this business. We’re pivoting.’ And everybody said, ‘We are with you.’ Not one employee left. In 15 months, we’ve been able to deploy more than $5 billion.” The final award of the night, Law Firm of the Year, was presented to the Real Estate and Land Use teams at Kramer Levin for handling billions of dollars of transactions for clients such as BlackRock, The Carlyle Group, Mount Sinai Hospital, NYU Langone Medical Center, The Nederlander Organization, Vornado Realty Trust and The Walt Disney Company, among many others. “I want to thank Commercial Observer for the honor, and for bringing greater transparency to our industry,” said Jay Neveloff, partner and chair of the real estate practice at Kramer Levin. “I want to thank my team, which I am incredibly proud to be part of. And I want to thank the other law firms that were recognized. It’s terrific when you have law firms you can collaborate with to get things done efficiently and in the right way.” In the face of a tumultuous and uncertain period for commercial real estate, the Commercial Observer Breakthrough Awards shined a positive light on the state of the industry, and left attendees with a sense of hope and promise for the future. “The general spirit of the room and the fact that it was a sold-out event,” said Freiman, “all indicate that there is a strong confidence in the market as we head into a new year.” Read the latest edition of the Commercial Observer online!

Manage your account German opposition leader Friedrich Merz, who hopes to become the next chancellor, is a millionaire ex-corporate lawyer who promises a return to his CDU party's conservative roots as an alternative to the far right. Now that centre-left Chancellor Olaf Scholz has lost a confidence vote following the dramatic collapse of his three-party coalition, Merz may soon get his chance after decades of waiting in the wings. Although he has never held government office, polls say Merz is the favourite to win the February 23 election. Merz, a 69-year-old Roman Catholic, hails from the rural Sauerland region of North Rhine-Westphalia and is the top candidate of the Christian Democratic Union and its Bavarian allies the CSU. A long-time rival of the CDU's centrist ex-chancellor Angela Merkel, Merz has criticised her legacy, from her open-door policy to migrants to her insistence on maintaining dialogue with Russia. Merz is a pro-business economic liberal, who published a book in 2008 titled "Dare More Capitalism", a passionate advocate of transatlantic ties and the European Union, and a defender of traditional social values. First elected to the Bundestag three decades ago, Merz took over the CDU leadership on his third attempt after its 2021 election defeat and was confirmed as its chancellor candidate in September. Firmly on the right of the CDU, Merz has backed a tougher immigration policy and law and order stance and pledged to reverse marijuana legalisation and Germany's phase-out of nuclear power, as he seeks to win back voters who have drifted to the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD). - Seeing red - Merz has sparked anger by labelling the sons of Muslim immigrants "little pashas" and accusing some Ukrainian war refugees of "social welfare tourism", before later apologising. In recent months he has led the charge in raining down withering criticism on Scholz's government, blaming its "wrongheaded" policies and "green-tinted interventionism" for the woes of Germany's stuttering economy. He is rhetorically skilled and visibly enjoys a good political scrap. The news magazine Der Spiegel said he also tends to take conflicts personally and is given to fits of anger, writing that "if Merz were a bullfighter, he would probably hold the red cloth in front of his stomach". Scholz too has tried to portray his rival as a "hothead" who would play "Russian roulette" with Moscow, by sending long-range missiles to Ukraine. Nonetheless, according to news weekly Die Zeit, the old-school conservative is "currently the CDU's answer" to the recent electoral successes of the AfD, which is polling at close to 20 percent. - Hobby pilot - Merz was born on November 11, 1955 and has been married for more than 40 years to Charlotte Merz, a judge. They have three adult children. Merz, who at 198 cm (6ft 6 in) stands out in a crowd, is a licensed pilot who sometimes flies his own private jet. Trained as a lawyer, he was elected to the European Parliament in 1989 and then to the Bundestag, where his mentor was the CDU's powerful late finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble. But Merz lost out in a power struggle against Merkel, who took over the CDU leadership in 2002 as the party struggled to rebuild after Helmut Kohl's chancellorship ended in a slush fund scandal. Merkel went on to become Germany's second-longest serving post-war chancellor while Merz -- humiliated, and his influence greatly diminished -- opted for a hiatus from politics. He left parliament in 2009 and for over a decade pursued a successful career in the private sector. He worked as a corporate lawyer, built up a personal fortune and held senior positions on the boards of US investment firm BlackRock and multiple other companies. His business world success and wealth have left him open to charges of being out of touch with most German voters -- a claim he has rejected by insisting he belongs to the "upper middle class". ilp-sr-jsk/fz/giv Wrapping up their own investigation on the Jan. 6 2021 Capitol attack, House Republicans have concluded it's former GOP Rep. Liz Cheney who should be prosecuted for probing what happened when then-President Donald Trump sent his mob of supporters as Congress was certifying the 2020 election. The findings issued Tuesday show the Republican Party working to reinforce Trump's desire to punish his perceived enemies including Cheney and members of the Jan. 6 committee that the president-elect has said should be in jail. President-elect Trump dropped a round of ambassador nominations on social media Tuesday night, naming Herschel Walker and Nicole McGraw as nominees to serve in the Bahamas and Croatia. Our poll, the first post-election poll specifically focused on trust in government, reveals that while voters are less trusting of the government as a result of the election, they believe the government will be more effective and can get things done. There was “a lot of lying from the president-elect” but one comment stood out, said Daniel Dale. Instead, death and destruction in Ukraine has actually intensified since Donald Trump won the election last month. President-elect Trump’s attorney unsuccessfully asked a federal judge to move forward with his lawsuit against journalist Bob Woodward over published audio tapes of interviews the famed Watergate reporter conducted with Trump for a 2020 book. U.S. District Judge Paul Gardephe, an appointee of former President George W. Bush who is overseeing the case, denied the… Head of RT Margarita Simonyan, a decorated state TV propagandist and Kremlin insider, has spilled not only Russia’s hopes and dreams for Donald Trump’s second term in office but also Moscow’s strategy for suckering him in. She believes that Russian President Vladimir Putin has an irresistible sway over Trump and will extract the desired outcome—but only if they meet face-to-face, without any influence or interference from other American power brokers, à la Helsinki, where the two men held discus After more than two decades in power and countless lives lost, Bashar al-Assad has fled to Moscow with his family. But when regimes collapse and bloodthirsty dictators end up abroad, what happens next? Just as tyrants themselves differ, so does their time in exile. President-elect Trump sought to thread a needle during his Monday press conference at Mar-a-Lago, pushing back at suggestions that his incoming administration would be dangerously radical, even as he avoided any whiff of actual backsliding. The version of Trump who appeared before reporters at his Florida resort was — at times — tonally different from… A federal appeals court judge has withdrawn his intention to retire, depriving President-elect Donald Trump of the ability to make an influential circuit court nomination and enraging Senate Republicans. Syrian leader Bashar Assad issued what appeared to be his first public statement since he was ousted and fled with his family to Russia more than a week ago. When Bernard Jones Jr. and his wife, Doris, built their dream home, they didn’t hold back. With water, electricity, clean air and food, they felt ready for any disaster, even a nuclear blast, at their bucolic home in California’s Inland Empire. Critics warn these bunkers create a false perception that a nuclear war is survivable. The president-elect has teased it before, albeit under the cover of "jokes." "Get it together, America." President-elect Trump labeled former Canadian Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland’s behavior as “totally toxic” and argued it is detrimental to the country’s dealmaking with the U.S. shortly following her resignation from the post. “The Great State of Canada is stunned as the Finance Minister resigns, or was fired, from her position by Governor Justin Trudeau,” Trump… The pair worked together at PayPal. "I feel like I sold all these students a load of garbage." A former White House chef spilled the tea on Donald Trump’s favorite meals—and why the president-elect may have a healthier diet than many Americans think. Chef Andre Rush, who also worked as a chef in the White House for the likes of Trump, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama, told Politico’s West Wing Playbook that the upcoming 47th President of the United States likes to keep his meals simple and isn’t the biggest fan of snacking. While Trump is notably a fan of the classic Amercan Iran's supreme leader said Tuesday that Israel and the United States were "completely wrong" to imagine the Tehran-backed axis of resistance had collapsed with the ouster of Syria's longtime strongman."They are completely wrong." The Supreme Court turned back an appeal Monday from Peter Navarro, the former White House official who is set to return in Donald Trump's second term after serving prison time on contempt of Congress charges. It comes after the Justice Department sued Navarro, saying he had retained presidential records on an unofficial email account he used during his previous White House tenure under Trump. The government says the records must be turned over to the National Archives. "This can’t be legal," said an X user. "Why does this administration want to weaken the United States?" Donald Trump is reportedly eyeing a Democrat as his top contender to lead FEMA. Federal authorities including the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security say these sightings are mostly not drones at all. It's part of a "striking pattern," said Ayman Mohyeldin. President-elect Donald Trump on Monday suggested that he may reverse President Joe Biden's recent decision to allow Ukrainian forces to use American long-range weapons to strike deeper into Russian territory. Trump called the decision made by Biden last month “stupid." With the loosening of the restrictions, Biden gave Ukraine long-sought permission to use the Army Tactical Missile System provided by the U.S. to strike Russian positions hundreds miles from its border. Russian troops were loading a truck at the entrance to the port they control in the Syrian city of Tartus on Monday, while Islamist fighters manned a nearby checkpoint.There Russian troops could be seen on Monday sand and rubble into a truck at their first checkpoint. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene continues to speculate wildly about the drones. Donald Trump's niece also pinpointed the "most depressing thing" about her relative's imminent return to power. Trump is calling on President Biden to "stop selling the wall," but the White House said it is following the law for unused wall pieces. Brandon Gill's alarming comments came a day after President-elect Donald Trump appeared with Daniel Penny at the Army-Navy football game. Twelve Western countries have agreed measures to "disrupt and deter" Russia's so-called shadow fleet of vessels in order to prevent sanctions breaches and increase the cost to Moscow of the war in Ukraine, Estonia's government said on Monday. The measures were agreed by Germany, Britain, Poland, the Netherlands, the five Nordic nations and the three Baltic states, said Estonia, where leaders of the 10-nation Joint Expeditionary Force were due to meet on Tuesday. WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President-elect Donald Trump said on Monday he had a "very good talk" with Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, about the war in Gaza and reiterated his threat that "all hell is going to break out" if Hamas does not release its hostages by Jan. 20, the day Trump takes office. "As you know, I gave a warning that if these hostages aren't back home by that date, all hell is going to break out," he said during a press conference in Palm Beach, Florida. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said he is “ready to catch my breath” as he prepares to leave his post with President-elect Trump taking over next month. Trump has tapped former Rep. Sean Duffy (R-Wis.), a former Fox Business host who first came to fame on MTV’s “Real World,” host to replace Buttigieg. Buttigieg was asked… ‘We stand ready to utilize every tool at our disposal—whether through state law enforcement or the National Guard—to support President Trump in this vital mission,’ 26 governors say in letter Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) said on Tuesday that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. told him he has come to an agreement with President-elect Trump on the issue of abortion, concluding the matter will be left to the states to decide. Speaking to reporters after his meeting with Trump’s pick to lead the Department of Health and… Donald Trump is feeling emboldened in his war on journalism. Former Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.), a former military pilot, said Sunday that all of the mysterious drone sightings he has seen video of have been airplanes. “Honestly, every video I’ve seen — and I’ve spent the last couple of days looking at every one of these videos — every video I have seen on Twitter,… Donald Trump Jr may be the most MAGA member of his family apart from his father, but some of his inner circle apparently fear his new girlfriend’s credentials don’t quite match up. American warplanes could be kept from joining the fray of a conflict with China for days or weeks, analysts have concluded. In 1940, British forces attacked the fleet of its former ally in French Algeria, killing nearly 1,300 French sailors. Donald Trump has alleged there was jury misconduct in his New York hush money criminal trial. Prosecutors called it "unsworn, unsupported, hearsay." Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez had been gunning to be the ranking member on the House Oversight Committee. The locals had no idea what it was the Israelis dropped on the Syrian military base at Bimalkah. They just knew it produced a series of almighty and rather terrifying explosions.

Title: House Committee Says It Finds Evidence of ‘Climate Cartel’

The House Judiciary Committee said it’s found “substantial evidence of collusion and anticompetitive behavior” by the financial industry to “impose radical ESG-goals” on US companies. An interim report published by the Republican-led committee said “a cartel” of financial firms and climate activists sought to replace Exxon Mobil Corp. board members in 2021 after the company declined to make a series of climate pledges. “Unfortunately, the pressure campaign against Exxon Mobil isn’t an isolated incident,” the committee wrote. “Through coordinated shareholder pressure campaigns at US companies, the climate cartel seeks to use the trillions of dollars it manages to impose its agenda on the US economy and drain it of affordable energy.” Far from igniting strategic turmoil, the actions against Exxon led by a firm called Engine No. 1 coincided with a massive upturn in the company’s fortunes. The oil giant made record profits in 2022 and its stock outperformed rivals as crude prices bounced back from the pandemic. Exxon now has plans to produce more oil and gas by 2030 than at any time since the 1970s, and also spend $30 billion on low-carbon ventures like carbon capture, hydrogen and lithium. The judiciary committee, chaired by Ohio Republican Jim Jordan, singled out groups including Climate Action 100+ and the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero for leading what they described as a climate crusade. The committee said its investigation is ongoing. The claims by the House Judiciary Committee are “completely false,” said a spokesperson for CA100+, adding that the group “doesn’t control how shareholders vote, nor has it ever done so.” Last month, BlackRock Inc., Vanguard Group Inc. and State Street Corp. were sued by a group of states led by Texas for allegedly breaking antitrust laws by boosting electricity prices through their investments. BlackRock and State Street both pushed back against the allegations. State Street, for example, said the suit is “baseless and we look forward to presenting the facts through the legal process.” Vanguard declined to comment when contacted after the suit was filed on Nov. 27. The committee’s report is the latest salvo against environmental, social and governance investing. And the expectation is that President-elect Donald Trump will add his support to the GOP’s attacks against ESG.

Title: From $45,000 to $500,000, here's the bull and bear case for bitcoin in 2025

Bitcoin has been on a tear in 2024, surging 145% year-to-date and breaching the psychological $106,000 in recent days. The volatile cryptocurrency has been a polarizing asset, but with an incoming Trump administration, combined with the launch of bitcoin ETFs earlier this year, it seems more and more investors are starting to embrace bitcoin. But not everyone is bullish, and there are some on Wall Street who still see a coming correction in 2025. Here are the biggest bear and bull cases for the token next year. Chief global strategist Peter Berezin of BCA Research expects bitcoin to crash in 2025. Berezin, who is bearish on risk assets broadly for next year on the expectation that a recession will hit, said that bitcoin will finish 2025 at around $45,000, marking a decline of 57% from current levels. With his bearish outlook, Berezin said gold would finally outperform bitcoin in 2025, as investors seek safe-haven assets amid a period of economic weakness. To that point, he argues that bitcoin is not a store of value like gold, but is instead simply a high-beta play on technology stocks. The strategist provided the chart below, which shows the strong correlation between the price of bitcoin and the ProShares UltraPro QQQ 3x Shares ETF. The three-times levered ETF seeks to track daily movements in the Nasdaq 100 Index. Since 2018, the price of bitcoin has closely tracked the fund, with both assets trading about 650% higher in that time. Thus, a crash in tech stocks brought on by a bear market in 2025 would also spark a steep drop in the price of bitcoin. Way on the other end of the spectrum of bitcoin forecasts is Fundstrat's Tom Lee, who is highly bullish on the coin for next year. The strategist said the cryptocurrency is on track to soar 140% in 2025 to $250,000. However, the crypto could soar even higher if the Trump administration establishes a national bitcoin reserve. According to Lee, there are two tailwinds for bitcoin heading into the new year. The first is the halving price cycle for the cryptocurrency, which tends to be bullish for the price of bitcoin in the year following a halving event. The last bitcoin halving occurred on April 20 with another scheduled every four years. A halving reduces the amount of bitcoin that miners are rewarded for solving cryptographic problems by half, limiting the supply of new crypto coming to market. With new supply slashed, the price should rise if demand stays constant or increases. The second factor that is bullish for bitcoin in 2025 is "friendlier government regulations," Lee said in his outlook note last week. President-elect Donald Trump is viewed as a close ally to the crypto space, and his recent administration picks, like Paul Atkins for SEC Chairman, have been cheered by the market. And there could be even more upside for bitcoin in 2025 if a US strategic reserve is announced and implemented. "Our Head of Digital Assets Strategy, Sean Farrell, believes that a US Bitcoin Strategic Reserve adds upside to Bitcoin as much as $500,000 in 2025," Lee said in a Monday note. That target represents a 381% increase from current levels. Finally, Lee highlighted that a recent white paper from BlackRock recommends a 2% portfolio allocation to bitcoin for investors. The recommendation could spark further institutional adoption of bitcoin and fuel demand for the crypto, helping push the price higher.

Title: Germany is heading for federal elections – here’s what you need to know

Follow: Germany, Europe’s largest economy and normally a pillar of stability, is facing snap elections next year after Chancellor Olaf Scholz lost a vote of confidence. His government collapsed in November in a budget dispute but his coalition had been unsteady for months. Scholz lost the vote, which he called himself as a step toward securing an early national election, with 394 ballots against him, 207 in his favor and 116 abstentions. With the election date set for February 23 next year, here’s what’s at stake. There will be seven major parties for which Germans will vote. Four of the seven have made official announcements about their Kanzlerkandidaten – candidates for chancellor. The ever-present two dominant parties of German politics, the Christian Democrats (CDU) and Christian Social Union (CSU), unofficially known as the Union, make up one grouping. The Social Democrats, or SPD, form another. Given the German system of proportional representation, the government tends to be formed in a coalition, usually headed by the CDU/CSU or the SPD. The winner looks for a partner to form a majority. Since 2021, Scholz’s SPD had governed in an uneasy coalition with the liberal Free Democrats Party (FDP) and the Green Party. In the 16 years before Scholz’s three-party coalition, the CDU, under Angela Merkel, had relied on both the SPD and the FDP as partners in different governments.

The far-right Alternative for Deutschland party (AfD) has seen strong performances in regional elections give it a national boost. The party’s co-leader, Alice Weidel, is its Kanzlerkandidat. She is known for slick talking and populist policies, particularly on migration. She’s an ardent supporter of upholding traditional German values, famously saying “no one touch my schnitzel!” – a reference to the popular dish. The Green Party should also be considered one to watch. It is unlikely to gather enough votes to be the biggest party, but nonetheless could play an important role in the formation of the next government. The Greens will be led by Robert Habeck, currently the nation’s Economics Minister. The three other major parties will be the Free Democrats; the BSW, a left-wing socialist group named after its leader, Sahra Wagenknecht; and lastly Die Linke, a left-wing political party. All three have yet to officially announce their candidates. Barring a major and unexpected reversal in the polls, Merz of the CDU/CSU is highly likely to be Germany’s new chancellor. National opinion polls currently have the CDU/CSU way out ahead of the others, with 32% of support from those surveyed. The AfD are currently polling in second place with 18%, the SPD in third with 16%, and the Greens with 14%. Merz is not a newcomer to German politics, but this is his second iteration as a politician. Between 1989 and 1994, Merz was a member of the European Parliament (MEP) for Germany. He subsequently became a member of the Bundestag, or German parliament, representing the CDU there until 2009. He then left politics to work as a corporate lawyer, where he sat on many supervisory boards, including at investment giant BlackRock. Merz represents the constituency of Hochsauerlandkreis in the Bundestag, the region in which he was born, and currently lives in his hometown of Brilon. He is also widely reputed to be a millionaire and has a private pilot’s license. Merz made two failed attempts to become CDU head in 2018 and 2020. In 2021 he returned as a member of the Bundestag, for the first time in 12 years, and subsequently went on to secure the nomination as head of the CDU, officially taking over in September 2022. Related article Zelensky accuses German chancellor of opening ‘Pandora’s box’ with Putin He is known for having shifted the CDU to the right, with a tougher stance on migration, and a strong economic mind. During his bid to become party leader, he campaigned on not being a Merkel-style heir, unlike his challengers, thus marking the end of the centrist policies of the CDU during her era as chancellor. Leonie von Randow, a political reporter at German broadcaster WELT TV who will be covering the election campaign, told CNN that Merz “knows a thing or two about the economy, and that is obviously something that many people care about. Many people hope (he) can move things forward.” Merz is a very strong proponent of backing Ukraine as it fights Russia’s full-scale invasion. He has been a vocal supporter of giving Ukraine German-made Taurus missiles, weapons that could be used to attack Russian targets far beyond Ukraine’s front lines. Scholz, by contrast, has consistently refused to supply them to Kyiv. Merz made a surprise trip to the Ukrainian capital earlier this month, where he urged European nations to form a “common vision” for peace in Ukraine, especially given the impending arrival of US President-elect Donald Trump in the White House. The economy is going to play a central role in the election, particularly given its sluggish performance under Scholz. In recent days the German Central Bank has revised down predicted growth forecasts by 0.2%, stating that “the German economy is set to stagnate in the winter half-year 2024-25 and only begins to make a slow recovery over the course of 2025.” Connected to the debate on the economy will be a focus on reviving the country’s important automotive industry. The Central Bank has said that problems within the industry are “structural,” and are thus exacerbating the drag on the economy. Major companies including Volkswagen, one of world’s largest car manufacturers, are facing major layoffs and plant closures. Arguments over immigration will also be critical in this election, particularly as parties look to lure votes away from a surging AfD, which has made it a core issue. “The election is probably coming at a very good time for the AfD… this is a moment when many people are generally very unhappy with the government, so they kind of want to make a point and vote for an extreme party to show how unhappy they are,” von Randow told CNN. Scholz reintroduced checks on borders with neighboring European nations in recent months, a move many saw as him trying to curry favor with voters who may be turning towards the populist AfD. The collapse of the Assad regime in Syria will also play into the national debate. Germany took in more Syrian migrants than any other European nation during its civil war. Campaigning around how each party would handle immigrants has already started. It is very hard to see an outcome where the CDU/CSU and Friedrich Merz do not emerge victorious. Their lead appears cemented and unassailable, but the major question surrounds the formation of a stable government. The CDU/CSU are unlikely to win an outright majority of the 630 seats up for grabs. That means they will have to form a coalition with one (or more) of the other parties. The question is who? Should the AfD perform as the opinion polls suggest, it would mark a major sea change in German politics. Since its formation in 2013, the party has never gained more than 94 seats. It finished as the fifth biggest party in 2021 and third largest in 2017. While the AfD will see themselves as potential kingmakers, the CDU/CSU may be unwilling to give them such a prominent voice in running the country. That leaves the SPD, with whom they have worked previously, particularly in the Merkel era. Or, they could look further left towards the Greens, but that also may come with a clash of principles and policies, given their more left-leaning nature. Either way, the federal election looks likely to leave the SPD and Scholz deeply humbled, and entering into a period of self-reflection. “It is probably the end of his political career,” von Randow told CNN.

Title: Here’s Why US Manufacturers Can’t Quit China

Graphic of Made in America Sign with Freight Ship from China US manufacturers face increasing pressure to divest from China due to threats of mounting tariffs and geopolitical instability, but the reality is, most can’t decouple. Trade wars notwithstanding, the US simply can’t quit China. But, that’s not for lack of effort. There has been a trend over the last six-plus years toward shifting manufacturing activities away from China. According to a 2023 report published by Boston Consulting Group (BCG), Harnessing the Tectonic Shifts in Global Manufacturing, US goods imports from China declined by 10% from 2018 through 2022 in inflation-adjusted terms, they rose by 18% from Mexico, 44% from India, and 65% from the ten countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.* Graphic from 2023 Report from BCG - Harnessing the Tectonic Shifts in Global Manufacturing - Change ... [+] in US goods imports, 2018 - 2022 Wage inflation, or rising labor costs was the initial driver for companies to turn away from China. According to the ​​US China-Business Council, China has not been considered a low labor cost production base in over ten years. Thus, labor-intensive and cost-sensitive industries like textiles have been moving out of China, to countries like Vietnam and Bangladesh, since the mid-2010s. But over the last six years, a cascade of other factors have bubbled to the surface, signaling to US companies, the China party is over and it is time to “break up”. First, in 2018, geopolitical factors intensified, with President Trump’s imposition of tariffs on almost all Chinese exports. Then, in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic exposed underlying weaknesses in the global supply chain as factories shut down and ports were closed, logistics networks that were essential for critical goods such as medical supplies, semiconductors and consumer goods were disrupted and freight costs surged due to high demand (The cost to ship a container from China to the west coast of the US increased ten-fold from around $2,000 to over $20,000 in the first nine months of 2021). Next, in 2022, the Russia / Ukraine conflict led to an increase in the price of commodities like oil, gas and grain, which China imports from Russia, leading to volatility in its domestic production costs. What’s more, escalating security breaches, including China sending spy balloons into US territory in 2023 and hacking major telecommunication providers in 2024, made already strained geopolitical tensions worse. According to a House Committee report on Homeland Security released in October 2024, the FBI opens new cases to counter the Chinese Communist Party's espionage and intelligence operations roughly every 12 hours. And finally, China’s ongoing military drills threatening to annex Taiwan have a direct impact on: (1) US national security interests, because the US sees Taiwan as part of an “island chain” of allies (along with Japan, South Korea and the Philippines); and (2) US economic interests, since Taiwan is a major manufacturer of semiconductor microchips and IT hardware equipment for US companies like Nvidia, Qualcomm and Apple. Needless to say, many companies have been “de-risking” their supply chain by diversifying into more stable regions in Asia, and near-shoring to Mexico and Central America. The automotive industry, particularly electric vehicle production, has seen substantial reshoring activity. The semiconductor industry has also significant reshoring activity, spurred by national security concerns and government initiatives such as the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 (CHIPS Act). I spoke with Scott Ellyson, Chief Executive Officer of East West Manufacturing (East West), a global engineering and manufacturing services company based in Atlanta, Georgia, to gain an “inside look” at how his company’s supply chain has shifted in recent years. Scott Ellyson, Chief Executive Officer East West was initially founded in 2001, with the goal of leveraging manufacturing arbitrage globally to help clients reduce overall cost and increase competitiveness - and that meant initially setting up shop in China - in the Shenzhen region. The company, which produces thousands of products for Fortune 100 and 500 companies, including medical equipment like defibrillators and ventilators, electric motors, robotics, exercise equipment and HVAC / cooling devices, has since expanded operations to nine sites in seven countries. Ellyson explained that the decision to establish manufacturing operations in a particular region is complex, and depends on several key factors. And, low cost labor is not actually the most important consideration (which makes sense since China has not been a low labor cost production region for several years). More critical factors include: access to raw materials and a network of suppliers, skilled labor, distribution and logistics infrastructure and tax incentives. For example, East West was able to shift certain production capacity from China to Vietnam in 2002, because rubber was readily available in Vietnam and it wasn’t a very complicated supply chain. And, the company has been able to deepen its operations after identifying additional resources uniquely available in Vietnam. “Raw materials are typically the main driver in my experience,” Ellyson explained. Ellyson elaborated that they have also acquired a facility in Costa Rica, for medical manufacturing, in part because Costa Rica has a free trade agreement with both China and the US, so raw materials and components can be imported, and finished products can be exported, without tariffs. However, the logistical costs there are very high, so “we focus on small products with value density” in that region where you can “air freight in, air freight out, without major expense.” East West also has two facilities in Juarez, Mexico. Ellyson shared that for products that have a high amount of mechanical components like plastics and metal, it is a pretty “immature supply-chain” and the costs are 15-20% higher than Asia. But, some of this is offset by better lead-time from final assembly to delivery (one week vs. one month or more); lower freight costs ($2-4K to drive a truck over the border vs. $6-7K to ship a container from Asia); and low tariffs due to the free trade agreement through the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or the USMCA. And so with such a clear rationale and demonstrable efforts to decouple from China, why can’t we just “break up” already? Understanding why China has a chokehold on the US and many multinational companies has a lot to do with the government’s creation of special economic zones (SEZs) in the 1980s that were designed to attract foreign investment, spur innovation and accelerate industrial growth. The first SEZs were considered experiments because previously China was a “closed” economy, where the government controlled almost all aspects of production, prices, and resource allocation, effectively isolating itself from the global market and limiting private enterprise and foreign trade. Sunset in Shenzhen, China For example, the city of Shenzhen was once a small fishing village of 30,000 before it was designated as one of the first SEZ in 1980. Now, Shenzhen, which was ranked as a top ten global finance center in 2024, is home to multinational tech companies like Huawei and Tencent (maker of Wechat) and in 2023 was listed by Forbes as one of the top 10 cities with the most billionaires, is considered by some to be “China’s Silicon Valley”. The Shenzhen experiment illustrates what happens when you bring together dense clusters of suppliers, logistical infrastructure (including highways, railroads, and ports), skilled workers, economic investment and tax incentives. In fact, it has been estimated by the World Economic Forum that 90% of the world's electronics are made in Shenzhen, including mobile phones, televisions, air conditioning units, and drones. The other major piece that gives China its competitive edge is the access to critical raw materials (CRMs) such as cobalt, titanium, lithium, magnesium, and rare earth elements, either by mining them directly or importing them from other countries and refining them. In 2022, the US Geological Survey published a list of 50 mineral commodities critical to the US economy (and national security) and China is the primary source of 26 of the 50 minerals. These CRMs are used in a variety of sectors, including energy production, communication technology, transportation, and national defense and are essential for everything from mobile phones and computer hard drives, to batteries for electric vehicles, as well as precision-guided missiles and high-tech ammunition. Leading Import Sources (2019–22) of Non-fuel Mineral Commodities where US was Greater Than 50% Net ... [+] Import Reliant As a consequence, US companies are heavily reliant on Chinese companies to source component parts, and manufacture products more cost effectively. Boeing has stated China has a component role on every current Boeing commercial airplane model — the 737, 747, 767, 777 and 787 Dreamliner; and that more than 10,000 Boeing airplanes currently fly throughout the world with parts and assemblies built in China. Apple has been relocating factories into Southeast Asia and India, but still relies on several Chinese-made components in its products, such as acoustics, glass, connectors, and display panels. Apple also assembles the majority of iPhones, iPads and MacBooks and other accessories in China (in Shenzhen, Chengdu, and Zhengzhou), through its contract manufacturing partner, Foxconn. And, while Tesla manufactures its vehicles for the US market in the US, forty percent of Tesla’s EV battery suppliers are Chinese companies. Ellyson of East West drilled down on the economic realities of the supply chain trickling back to China, elaborating that they had two plant closures in North Carolina in 2024, which were a direct result of the 25% tariffs imposed by President Trump in his first term. He shared, “we were one of the largest electronics assemblers east of the Mississippi and many of the components have to come from Asia…there is no domestic source,” so when faced with already higher labor costs in the US, combined with the rising cost of important component parts due to the tariffs, “we had to move most of those assemblies to Costa Rica and Mexico.” I also spoke with Cres Ferrell, Managing Partner at ReNEW Manufacturing Solutions (ReNEW), which is a "Build-to-Print" machining and fabrication company with five locations, all located in the US. He explained that nearshoring to Mexico, is really just the “China backdoor.” Map of US - Mexico Border ReNEW produces machinery parts for large Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) – mostly using carbon steel, including components for railcars, locomotives, and heavy construction equipment. However, they are constantly negotiating with their OEM customers that want to cut costs by moving to Mexico. Just across the border, Chinese companies have set up shops and are “importing steel at a 70% discount to US steel” and then the OEMs can import product to the US, tariff-free, under the USMCA. As a consequence, ReNEW has to remain competitive by creating operational efficiencies through automation and by extension, reducing spend on US labor. With so much fragmentation of the global supply chain, it begs the question, what can and should be manufactured and assembled right here in the USA, at competitive prices. Ferrell emphasized that there is opportunity in the machining and fabrication industry, explaining that there are actually 200,000 component parts of a locomotive but there is a huge shortage of skilled labor because technical trades like welding, for example, are no longer taught in high school as a vocation. Both Ellyson and Ferrell agree that there are certain products that can be prioritized for US manufacturing, such as complex or new technology that requires a lot of precision, validation and hands-on, high-touch support and expertise. It’s an important step in the right direction that the Biden administration did pass three massive pieces of legislation funneling trillions of dollars and/or tax incentives toward US innovation and industrial productivity, that have ultimately fueled a manufacturing renaissance across the US. Since 2021, over $2.1 trillion has been allocated by the government to pro-manufacturing initiatives through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, and the CHIPS Act. And according to Blackrock, as of November 2023, the private sector has pledged an additional $614 billion towards the production of semiconductors, electric vehicles, and batteries. But, it will require much more capital and investment to build up the US manufacturing ecosystem similar to the SEZ model in China, and it may take decades to develop. In the meantime, “Made in China”, whether directly or indirectly, is the sobering reality that we face. * The ten countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations are: Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily After a string of high-end design collaborations and design exhibits between Paris and Miami, the biotechnology company is ready to present its first furniture pieces covered in Reishi. Senior Correspondent, Home and Interiors MILAN — Just over a year after Mycoworks’ Reishi, a new material grown from mycelium, debuted its first full fashion look at the Buro Stedelijk museum space in Amsterdam, it’s ready to take on the world of interiors. The first furniture pieces covered in Reishi are being made by the French family-run firm Ligne Roset and will hit the market in 2025, the California-based company told WWD. “We are so ready to enter that world. We are already here. For interior design, there are so many possibilities and we’re working with architects on private mansions and hotels as we speak,” said the firm’s senior vice president of sales Frederick Martel. Related Articles Fashion Scoops Loro Piana to Stage Exhibit in Shanghai Fashion Features The School of Fashion Design in Boston Names New Executive Director Mycoworks has been working with Ligne Roset, which was founded in 1860, for the past five years. Martel added that the collaboration has tested Reishi’s performance on an industrial level to understand if it will one day be able to meet market demands. Among those tests was putting 220 pounds in weight on top of a chair cushion made of Reishi and repeating that test 20,000 times. You May Also Like Other collaborations have followed, in Europe and North America, Martel said, declining to mention names. In 2021, Mycoworks rose to the international fore after it covered Hermès’ Victoria shopper bag with its high-end mycelium leather. Over the past year, the biotechnology company founded in 2013 by artists Phil Ross and Sophia Wang has been actively pushing Reishi into the broader design world and is gearing up to see Reishi-covered furniture sold on the wider market. During Design Miami Paris in October, Mycoworks enlisted seven French designers and artists to create seven products including folding screens, desks and lighting fixtures out of Reishi. At the Alcova space during Design Miami, Stockholm’s Studio Tooj introduced the Duk side table made with Reishi using cutting-edge craftsmanship. At the carbon-positive Populus hotel in Denver, 700 sheets of Reishi were used to construct a dramatic tapestry as its main centerpiece. Reishi is made of mycelium, which is the root structure of mushrooms. It is first grown in a sheet before it is harvested and finished into a soft material in Spain. Mycoworks, which is based in Emeryville, Calif., on the eastern edge of San Francisco Bay and to the north of Silicon Valley, is also amping up its industrial capacity. Last year it cut the ribbon on its first commercial-scale Fine Mycelium production plant in South Carolina. Spanning 136,000 square feet, the factory is equipped to employ more than 350 people, which was envisioned to facilitate an influx of orders estimated at “millions of square feet of Reishi per year,” the company said at the time. “This is the moment the luxury industry has been waiting for; a plastic-free, leather-like material that offers undeniable beauty and performance — at scale,” said Patrick Thomas, former chief executive officer of Hermès who now serves as a Mycoworks board member. “Now that the challenge of supply has been solved, brands will move quickly to commercialize items made with Reishi,” he said at the time. Mycoworks’ proprietary Fine Mycelium production process cultivates mycelium in a controlled environment, harnessing its natural growth to create smooth sheets of Reishi, it contends, that meet the luxury industry’s performance standards. One of Reishi’s major selling points is that it is easily made in perfect geometric rectangles and therefore more efficiently cut without waste, versus the 40 to 70 percent estimated for leather production, according to Martel. Since Reishi’s introduction the company has partnered with major brands across the luxury, fashion, home furnishings and automotive industries. In addition to Hermès and Ligne Roset, it has collaborated with General Motors. The latter has been a partner for several years and is emblematic of Mycoworks’ endeavors in the auto industry. Last July, Reishi was used for the interiors of the electric concept car Sollei, unveiled by Cadillac. The company has a diverse roster of investors that includes family-run businesses, venture capital firms, Decarbonization Partners, which is a Blackrock joint venture with Singapore firm Temasek, and VIPs like Natalie Portman. In July 2022, Mycoworks revealed $125 million in Series C financing, with a pool of investors that included Prime Movers Lab, SK Networks, Mirabaud Lifestyle Impact and Innovation Fund, in addition to other new and existing investors with track records in the biotech space. Across the board, alternative material firms have been a target by venture capital businesses and fashion firms alike. In 2019, Chanel acquired a minority stake in green chemistry company Evolved by Nature, as part of its strategy of developing sustainable materials. Formerly known as Silk Inc., the Boston-based firm focuses on designing and developing biomaterials-based products for industries ranging from personal care to textiles and medical devices. Its Activated Silk technology, consisting of natural silk in liquid form, provides a nontoxic alternative to chemicals in products.

Hit your long-term targets. Earn up to 16% per year on digital assets. Share this article Ethena Labs has launched USDtb, a new stablecoin backed by BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL). The stablecoin maintains a peg to the US dollar, holding 90% of its reserves in BUIDL issued by BlackRock. It was developed in partnership with Securitize, a leader in real-world asset tokenization. “In light of the rapidly accelerating demand for different stablecoin options, we saw a clear opportunity to provide a new product that offers users an entirely different risk profile from USDe without them having to leave our trusted ecosystem,” said Ethena founder Guy Young. The new stablecoin operates independently from Ethena’s flagship USDe token and can be used like any other stablecoin, allowing seamless and unrestricted transfers. USDtb will be available on multiple networks including Ethereum mainnet, Base, Solana, and Arbitrum through LayerZero integration. Ethena has been one of the fastest-growing DeFi protocols, attracting nearly $6 billion in user funds since early 2024. The introduction of USDtb is a strategic move by Ethena to further stabilize USDe, particularly during bearish market conditions, according to the company’s press release. USDe is Ethena’s flagship stablecoin, offering a steady $1 peg while providing users with an attractive 27% annualized yield under current conditions. Ethena’s Risk Committee has approved USDtb as a USDe backing asset, enabling the protocol to reallocate reserves to USDtb during periods of negative funding rates. Beyond its operational goals, Ethena’s governance token, ENA, has gained significant attention recently. Over the weekend, President-elect Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial purchased $500,000 worth of the token, sparking a 25% rally before ENA’s price eventually stabilized. At press time, ENA is trading at $1.21 with a market cap of $3.5 billion. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account? Create one Create your account Already have an account?

Nature and technology abstract concept, robot hand and natural hand covered with grass reaching to ... [+] each other, tech and nature union, cooperation, 3d rendering The boom of Artificial Intelligence has accelerated, revolutionized, and redefined industrial landscapes across the board. Clean tech is expanding in tandem, pushing the limit of innovative technologies. While each sector independently holds enormous – and in many cases untapped – potential, their combined power to accelerate the clean energy transition is especially promising. But as with any widespread technological advancement, growing pains often mark the start of a new era. Originally designed to generate centralized energy, the demands being put on our 20th century grid have expanded. The outdated system must now adapt to a multi-directional flow of electricity as clean energy efforts pull from alternative sources. That is where Green AI comes in. Set to tackle climate change, it promises to redefine energy systems with innovative solutions that prioritize sustainability and efficiency. Solar panels and wind turbines generating renewable energy for green and sustainable future. In 2022, the US Energy Information Administration predicted that by 2050, 44% of power will come from renewables — more than double the 21% achieved in 2023. In the EIA’s 2023 outlook, which takes into account the impact of the IRA, the prediction increased to a majority. To achieve this, a modernization of the grid is inevitable. The United States Department of Energy discussed this in its report, AI for Energy: Opportunities for a Modern Grid and Clean Energy Economy. Optimistic findings suggest that AI can unlock opportunities to accelerate a 100% clean energy future in the US. Real-time data will support the integration of renewables into the grid, while mitigating risks and anomalies that contribute to the $150 billion annual burden of power outages in the US. The United States is not the only country outgrowing the old model, with members of the Trans-European Networks for Energy adding smart electrical grids as one of three priority thematic areas. To support such targets, Slovenia and Croatia have successfully pioneered a cross-border smart grid initiative, improving accessibility and integration of renewable energy. Continuing towards a fully integrated European energy market, France and Germany have also launched a project to structure a cross-border energy optimization project. Regulation of critical infrastructure, like grids, is paramount to ensure safety, security and reliability of new technologies. Addressing this, the European union’s new AI Act will look to ensure robust risk management systems are in place. For grid application, this means AI models need to be rigorously validated, ethically implemented and in full compliance with power grid governance standards. In the US, the incoming administration’s regulatory stance on AI remains unclear. However, this ambiguity presents a significant opportunity to put in place a global, unified approach that enables innovation, while ensuring the right safeguards are in place. Aerial of power grid plant. Beyond the grid, other aspects of our infrastructure also demand innovation and regulation. With the age of hydropower facilities in the U.S. averaging over 70 years, the need for predictive maintenance has become increasingly urgent. Advancements in AI through the US Department of Energy’s Argonne National Laboratory are now enabling energy providers to forecast wear and tear as well as providing them with a prognosis on expected lifespan. AI also supports ushering in new infrastructure at various stages of the energy value chain from business development, construction, production and consumption to health and safety and corporate social responsibility. For example, AI can optimize the placement of renewables like hydropower dams, wind farms, solar panels and electric vehicle charging stations. It can go on to streamline the distribution of energy, optimize pricing, and aid with energy compliance standards by processing data from population, traffic and grid availability figures. Contributing to autonomous vehicle development, AI can improve safety and efficiency while reducing traffic accidents and energy consumption. AI applications are also being used in agriculture to enable precision farming, providing valuable insights into crop health, soil conditions, and irrigation needs, enabling farmers to make better use of resources, and reduce environmental impact.

From our homes to industrial settings, Building Management Systems are integrating AI capabilities to cut out needless energy use. AI-powered sensors can predict our daily power usage patterns to optimize heating, cooling and ventilation, as well as lighting, water management, and fire safety. Other AI solutions combine data with real-time emission figures from drones or satellites to detect bottlenecks and opportunities for optimization. But placing greater demand on our data centers is putting increasing pressure on the grid. According to Morgan Stanley Research, by 2027 AI's power demands may equal Spain’s 2022 energy consumption. Without careful management, this added energy demand could hinder sustainability efforts. Engineer manager check and control automation robot arms machine in intelligent industrial factory ...

This optimistic vision has spurred the emergence of Green AI, a cause championing AI-driven solutions to achieve a more sustainable, clean-energy future. However, realizing this requires a collective commitment to action from businesses and governments alike, ultimately ensuring that the energy consumed by data centers and machine learning is clean. Without this, we will create more CO2 to abate CO2. It would be like chasing our own tail. Together with the modernization of energy infrastructure and clear, stable regulation, these efforts can turn the promise of Green AI into a reality. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: Ethena Rolls Out Stablecoin Backed by BlackRock's BUIDL Token

Red-hot decentralized finance (DeFi) project Ethena said Monday it is rolling out its new stablecoin that aims to help stabilize the protocol's flagship USDe token when crypto markets turn bearish. The USDtb token aims to keep a steady $1 price and holds 90% of its reserves in BUIDL, the tokenized money market fund issued by asset management behemoth BlackRock and tokenization firm Securitize. "In light of the rapidly accelerating demand for different stablecoin options, we saw a clear opportunity to provide a new product that offers users an entirely different risk profile from USDe without them having to leave our trusted ecosystem,” Ethena founder Guy Young said in a statement. Ethena is one of the fastest-growing DeFi platforms this year, attracting nearly $6 billion of user funds since its public launch in early 2024. The protocol's flagship token USDe, marketed as a "synthetic dollar" with a steady $1 price, generates yield to investors by shorting bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and solana (SOL) perpetual swaps and farming the funding rates. This investment strategy offers lofty yields – currently 27% annualized – when crypto markets are in bull mode, but can quickly turn unprofitable when things turn bearish with persistently negative funding rates. The new offering will allow Ethena close the underlying derivatives positions behind USDe and divert the backing assets to USDtb during periods of negative funding rates and mitigating risks, the Ethena team explained. The protocol also aspires to get USDtb accepted as collateral in the future for margin trading on centralized exchanges. Read more: Tokenized Treasuries: A Game-Changer for Collateral in Crypto Markets Ethena enlisted Copper, Zodia Custody, Komainu, and Coinbase Institutional as custodians for USDtb, according to a press release. Liquidity providers for the token include Jump, Cumberland, Amber Group, GSR Markets and SCB Limited. Ethena also applied with the new USDtb stablecoin for Sky's, formerly MakerDAO, so-called Tokenization Gran Prix program that aims to invest up to $1 billion funds in tokenized real-world asset (RWA) products. The protocol's governance token recently garnered the attention of President-elect Donald Trump DeFi project World Liberty Financial, which purchased some $500,000 worth of tokens on Saturday, blockchain data showed. ENA subsequently rallied 25% over the weekend before paring some of the advance on Monday.

Title: Wamco Clients, Staff Head for Exits as Ken Leech Heads to Court
URL: https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/wamco-clients-staff-head-for-exits-as-ken-leech-heads-to-court-11734353491083.html
Time Published: 2024-12-16T12:51:30Z
Full Content:
(Bloomberg) -- Outwardly, all is upbeat at Western Asset Management, which has invited its staff and clients to celebrate the New Year by watching the Rose Parade from Wamco’s balconies in Pasadena, California, and cheer on the firm’s flower-bedecked entry, “Float Like a Butterfly.” The parade’s theme is “Best Day Ever!” The same can’t be said today for Wamco’s star bond trader, Ken Leech. He’s scheduled to appear in a Manhattan federal court Monday on fraud charges that have convulsed the investment firm and rippled through its owner, Franklin Resources Inc. Pension funds and other big clients have yanked vast sums since an investigation into his trading was disclosed in August — about $65 billion so far, with more withdrawals in the works. Inside Wamco, the staff is trying without much guidance from above to keep the firm operating while fretting about whether they should be exiting, too, according to more than a dozen people with knowledge of the situation. Jim Hirschmann, Wamco’s leader for more than two decades, has been rarely seen at the Pasadena headquarters, and Jenny Johnson, Franklin’s chief executive officer, has commented only briefly in public since Leech was charged. “It’s a difficult situation,” Johnson acknowledged last week at a Bloomberg conference in London. “There is never much upside to talking about a government investigation publicly.” Wamco abruptly replaced Hirschmann, 64, as CEO this month and moved him into the newly created post of chairman. The change came after US authorities accused Leech, Wamco’s former co-chief investment officer, of routinely waiting until late in the day to assign profitable trades to accounts that generated the most revenue, saddling other customers with losers. Franklin Impact The indictment late last month is a huge setback for Franklin, which had counted on the 2020 purchase of Wamco’s parent, Legg Mason, to broaden its business and stem persistent outflows of assets. Active managers like Franklin have been steadily losing ground to low-cost purveyors of index funds. Bloomberg Intelligence said at the time of the deal that it might be “key to Franklin’s survival.” Instead, the acquisition — which permitted Wamco to continue operating independently from Franklin — has turned into a financial and reputational fiasco. Franklin has already taken a roughly $390 million writedown on Wamco’s mutual fund business, and it’s facing an exodus of money along with the specter of its marquee manager appearing in a federal courtroom. The stock is down more than 25% this year. Hirschmann hasn’t been accused of wrongdoing in the federal cases. “Western Asset is a global company with offices across multiple continents,” said a Wamco representative. “As any CEO would, Jim spent a portion of his time traveling to other Western offices and meeting with clients across the globe.” Leech is on leave from Wamco and plans to fight the charges, which his lawyer says are unfounded. One Person Johnson portrayed the affair as isolated — “it was one person,” she told the conference attendees — and said Franklin is cooperating with investigators. She’s counting on Wamco’s remaining staff to turn things around. “The most important thing is that we still have a lot of clients invested in Western Asset,” Johnson said. “So we have made sure that we insulated the investment team from a lot of what’s going on with the investigation, so that we can ensure that they’re managing clients’ money and staying focused on that.” For some, it’s already too late. Defectors from the client list include the Marin County Employees’ Retirement Association, a customer for more than two decades with about $340 million. Almost $1 billion left with the Illinois Municipal Retirement Fund. Hundreds of millions more was pulled by the Ohio Bureau of Workers’ Compensation, the Chicago Teachers’ Pension Fund, the Dallas Employees’ Retirement Fund and the Anne Arundel County retirement system. Some who remain, including the Fresno County Employees’ Retirement Association in California, are interviewing replacements. Selling Pressure Employee ranks are fraying, too. At least two department leaders have left, and rival asset managers are being inundated by resumes from Wamco staffers, according to some of the people familiar with the situation. The mood at Wamco is tense and the lack of direction so marked that a full takeover of operations by Franklin would be a welcome outcome, said some of the people, who asked for anonymity to protect their jobs and relationships. Staffers are showing up to work early in the morning knowing they’re probably just going to have hit the “sell” button to raise the cash needed to pay off clients who are leaving, some of the people said. The discontent is no small matter for an asset manager like Franklin. “People can walk out the door,” Johnson said at the Bloomberg conference. “It’s not like a lot of other types of businesses.” On the day of Leech’s indictment, Hirschmann and two senior executives wrote to clients saying Wamco had upgraded compliance systems and was “taking steps to invest in key personnel in our investment team and broader support functions, with an eye toward retention, to ensure continuity of the high-quality service you have come to expect.” Some executives who learned of their bonuses in recent weeks also were informed about a retention package, the people said. Others wonder if they will be offered similar encouragement or if it’s worth it to stay, given the concern about getting tainted by Wamco’s woes. Leech’s Expertise Interviews with people who’ve worked with Leech portray him as an exalted figure internally and externally, in part for his mastery of markets and love of history. He shunned the spotlight, resisting interviews and television spots. Instead, he led the firm’s investing group, coming up with views on economies and bonds around the world from the US to Mexico to Russia, on inflation and on the health of financial firms. What he liked to do was trade — and often. Starting early enough to catch the market open in New York, Leech himself would place dozens of trades a day, sometimes in his own office away from the trading floor or at home, the people said. Insiders would sometimes wonder what Leech was up to, only later finding him on the trading floor or calling an assistant around the end of the day with instructions about which accounts got his trades. Other traders used the company’s technology systems instead to accomplish that task. What Leech didn’t do, according to court filings, was follow the company’s own compliance training — and US law — that call for promptly allocating trades. For 34 months, authorities claim, Leech “cherry-picked” the winning trades based on first-day gains and losses, giving more than $600 million of them to the most profitable accounts for the firm and the ones benefiting his own wallet. The disfavored clients allegedly got over $600 million of losing wagers. His attorney, Jonathan Sack, says the allegations “ignore key facts, including the fundamental differences between distinct fixed-income strategies and the irrelevance of first-day performance to managing these strategies.” What’s more, he says, Leech didn’t benefit from the alleged misconduct. Hirschmann’s Leadership While Leech was the trading brain, Hirschmann, who started a year before Leech in 1989, was the client and sales guy who helped propel the firm to prominence, especially in the 1990s and early 2000s. Hirschmann hasn’t been a big presence at the firm for a while. He’d regularly be on the road with clients or traveling on his private plane, according to some of the people interviewed. When he was at the Pasadena headquarters, he’d arrive in his own special van and ascend to his fifth-floor office on a private elevator few others used. Hirschmann rarely stepped foot on the trading floor, the people said, but he focused on physical aspects of the office, personally choosing carpet colors for Wamco meeting rooms and snacks sold in the cafeteria. One employee in London remembers how all the window blinds had to be pulled to the same level when Hirschmann visited. The fall has been dramatic for Wamco, a bond manager so prestigious that it once rivaled the likes of Pacific Investment Management Co. and BlackRock Inc. Founded in 1971, Wamco was one of the original West Coast fixed-income firms that rode a bond bull market for decades. Money flowed in from investors across the US and abroad and bonuses were lavish. Leech himself recently got almost $30 million a year. By the time Johnson bought Wamco parent Legg Mason in 2020, Wamco was the crown jewel and Leech the star manager. The purchase included a promise of autonomy for Wamco that expires in 2025. Tighter Ties Some of that independence is already being reeled in. Johnson and Hirschmann told a company town hall — via video rather than in person — that middle- and back-office functions would be integrated more fully into Franklin. New firmwide technology is on the way, and Wamco insiders are speculating about whether the new regime portends changes for the actual trading and investment desks. In calls with larger clients, Franklin reps now outnumber Wamco managers, the people said. They’re being peppered with questions about Wamco’s future, potential job cuts and who will pay for lawsuits and whatever fines are imposed. Given the sums involved, legal action against the company may follow. Fernando Vinzons, CIO for the Chicago Teachers’ fund, which pulled $550 million, said it’s “evaluating all available options.” For his part, Hirschmann said in a Dec. 3 memo that the firm is looking forward to introducing clients to Tom Gahan, his replacement as CEO. But the public announcement from Franklin didn’t include an interim period that typically comes with a leadership change. Hirschmann’s handoff, the company said, was “effective immediately.” “Jim has been pivotal in building Western Asset and his commitment to the business has not changed,” a Wamco spokesperson said. As for the upcoming parade, Wamco has been in Pasadena for decades and participating in the event is part of the firm’s sense of civic duty, the spokesperson said. The invitation says guests can arrive as early as 6:30 a.m. for a breakfast buffet to watch the marching bands, equestrians and the firm’s float roll by, and celebrate “the opportunities for renewal that each new year brings.” The RSVPs are due today. --With assistance from Francine Lacqua.

More legislation on crypto could be coming Lawmakers in more states can expect to see bills in 2025 to make them crypto-friendly as analysts say crypto is becoming a powerful lobby, bitcoin miners build new installations and venture capitalists underwrite a growing tech sector that caters to cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, a new crypto-friendly federal government under Trump and Congress could consider legislation from Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyoming, to create a federal bitcoin reserve on which states can piggyback. A bill introduced last month in Pennsylvania's House of Representatives sought to authorize the state's treasurer and public pension funds to invest in bitcoin. It went nowhere before the legislative session ended, but it caused a stir. “I had a friend who is a rep down the road text me, ‘Oh my god, I’m getting so many emails and phone calls to my office,' more than he ever did about any other bill,” said the measure's sponsor, Republican Mike Cabell. Cabell — a bitcoin enthusiast who lost his reelection bid — expects his bill to be reintroduced by a colleague. And leaders of bitcoin advocacy group Satoshi Action say they expect bills based on their model bill to be introduced in at least 10 other states next year. But what about public pension funds? Keith Brainard, research director for the National Association of State Retirement Administrators, said he doesn’t expect many public pension fund investment professionals, who oversee nearly $6 trillion in assets, to invest in crypto. Pension fund professionals take risks they deem to be appropriate, but bitcoin investing has a short track record, might only fit into a niche asset class and may not fit the risk-to-reward profile they seek. “There might be a bit of dabbling in bitcoin,” Brainard said. “But it’s difficult to envision a scenario in which pension funds right now are willing to make a commitment.” In Louisiana, Treasurer John Fleming helped make the state the first to introduce a system by which people can pay a government agency in cryptocurrencies. Fleming said he's not trying to promote cryptocurrency, but rather sees the step as a recognition that government must innovate and be flexible in helping people make financial transactions with the state. He said he would never invest his money, or the state's, in crypto. Fleming recalled meeting with a bitcoin lobbyist recently and came away unconvinced that bitcoin makes for a good investment. “My concern is that at some point it’ll stop growing and then people will want to cash in,” Fleming said. “And when they do, it could tank the value of a bitcoin.” In Pennsylvania, Treasury Department officials said they have the authority to decide for themselves if cryptocurrencies meet the agency's investment standards under state law and don't need new legislation. Still, a highly volatile asset is ill-suited to the agency's need for predictability, considering it writes millions of checks a year. The overwhelming majority of the roughly $60 billion it invests at any given time is in short-term, conservative investments designed for an investment period of months, officials there said. Pension boards, which invest on a 30-year time horizon, may already hold small investments in companies involved in mining, trading and storing cryptocurrencies. But they have been slow to embrace bitcoin. That could change, said Mark Palmer, managing director and a senior research analyst at The Benchmark Company in New York. Pension boards got investment tools they like this year when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the first exchange-traded funds that hold bitcoin and, in October, approved listings of options on those funds, Palmer said. Many “are likely in the process of getting up to speed on what it means to invest in bitcoin and kicking the tires, so to speak, and that’s a process that typically takes a while at the institutional level,” Palmer said. Several major asset managers like BlackRock, Invesco and Fidelity have bitcoin ETFs. Some states already are investing in crypto In May, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board became the first state to invest when it bought $160 million worth of shares in two ETFs, or about 0.1% of its assets. It later scaled back that investment to $104 million in one ETF, as of Sept. 30. A spokesperson declined to discuss it. Michigan's state investment board later reported about $18 million in bitcoin ETF purchases while a candidate for New Jersey governor, Steven Fulop, said that if elected he would push the state's pension fund to invest in crypto. Fulop, the Democratic mayor of Jersey City, just across the Hudson River from Manhattan, has been preparing for months to buy bitcoin ETF shares for up to 2% of the city's $250 million employee pension fund. “We were ahead of the curve," Fulop said. “And I think that’s what you’re eventually going to see is this is widely accepted, with regard to exposure in all pension funds, some sort of exposure.” ___ Follow Marc Levy on X at: https://x.com/timelywriter.

Title: What's Driving BNY Mellon Stock's Outperformance?

POLAND - 2024/12/05: In this photo illustration, the BNY Mellon company logo is seen displayed on a ... [+] smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Piotr Swat/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Custody banking giant BNY stock (NYSE: BK) has had a solid year, rising by 57% since early January, almost 2x the return of the S&P 500 over the same period, aided by a surge in asset prices globally. In comparison, BNY’s peer BlackRock (NYSE: BLK) is up 34% year-to-date. With the potential easing of regulations under President-Elect Trump, banks could benefit. See What’s The Outlook For U.S. Bancorp Stock? So what’s happening with BNY stock? While the stock has done well this year, it has seen considerable volatility over the last few years. Returns for the stock were 41% in 2021, -19% in 2022, and 19% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could BK face a similar situation as it did in 2023 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a recovery? BNY, whose key businesses include custody, treasury services, markets, wealth, as well as investment management, outperformed the street estimates in the third quarter of 2024. Total revenue was up 5% year-over-year to $4.6 billion. The gains come as the company has expanded assets under custody and administration by 14% year-over-year to $52 trillion, followed by an 18% rise in Assets under Management to $2.1 trillion, led by higher asset valuations as well as inflows. This helps BNY given that it generates fees based on the amount of assets that clients keep with the bank. Overall, fee-based revenue rose about 5% compared to last year while net interest-related revenue grew by 3%, led by improved investment securities portfolio yields as well as balance sheet growth. Profits grew at an even quicker pace. Earnings per share stood at $1.50, up 22% year-over-year as non-interest-related expenses remained roughly flat compared to last year, as the company has been streamlining its operations to cut costs while focusing on higher-margin businesses. So what lies ahead for BNY stock? The markets have generally been bullish post the U.S. election, with Donald Trump set to assume the presidency for a second term. Investors are betting that the Trump administration’s focus on deregulation could translate into a more lenient approach to financial oversight compared to the Biden administration. This could help banks such as BNY in a couple of ways. For instance, lower compliance costs which could boost profitability. Moreover, higher potential economic growth, coupled with lower interest rates, should bode well for asset prices, helping custody banks like BNY. Trump has also been in favor of tax cuts, which could also help the bottom lines of banks. We have a $76 per share price estimate for BNY, which is roughly in line with the market price.

Title: CMA launches probe into BlackRock’s £2.55bn acquisition of Preqin
URL: https://www.techmonitor.ai/data/cma-preqin-blackrock-investigation/
Time Published: 2024-12-16T09:55:02Z
Full Content:
The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has announced an investigation into BlackRock’s £2.55bn acquisition of UK-based private markets data provider Preqin. The British competition watchdog is assessing whether the deal, announced in June 2024, could potentially lead to a significant lessening of competition within the UK market. On 3 December 2024, the CMA issued an invitation for public comments seeking input on how the transaction might impact competition in the country. This marks the initial stage of the regulator’s review process under the Enterprise Act 2002. Stakeholders have until 17 December 2024 to submit their views. The CMA officially commenced its initial assessment phase on 16 December 2024. By 12 February 2025, the regulator is expected to announce whether the transaction will progress to a more detailed Phase 2 investigation. The inquiry is part of the CMA’s broader mandate to ensure mergers and acquisitions do not harm competition, restrict consumer choice, or create monopolies within UK markets. The acquisition will see global asset management giant BlackRock integrating Preqin’s extensive private markets data and research capabilities into its technology platform, Aladdin. Preqin, an independent data provider, delivers insights to over 200,000 users worldwide, including asset managers, insurers, pension funds, and banks. The UK-based firm’s data spans 190,000 funds, 60,000 fund managers, and 30,000 investors in the private markets sector. The company, which is projected to generate £240m in recurring revenue in 2024, has experienced an annual growth rate of approximately 20% over the past three years. BlackRock’s aim is to leverage Preqin’s offerings to strengthen its position in the fast-growing private markets data segment, a key area for investors seeking alternatives to traditional public markets. In addition, the integration of Preqin with eFront, Aladdin’s private markets platform, is expected to unite data, research, and investment workflows to support fund managers and investors across fundraising, deal sourcing, portfolio management, accounting, and performance analysis. The BlackRock-Preqin deal is the latest in a series of high-profile cases reviewed by the CMA. In November, the CMA assessed Google’s partnership with AI start-up Anthropic, determining that it did not warrant further investigation. This followed its abandonment of similar merger investigations into deals struck by Microsoft with AI startups Mistral and Inflection. Earlier this month, the regulator also approved the merger of telecom giants Vodafone and Three, subject to stringent conditions designed to protect consumer interests.

Title: BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Put Options at $30, $35 Price Levels See Volume Spike

Title: BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Put Options at $30, $35 Price Levels See Volume Spike

Time Published: 2024-12-16T09:31:12Z

Surging volumes in put options linked to BlackRock's Nasdaq-listed spot bitcoin ETF (IBIT) could be interpreted as bearish sentiment. That's not necessarily the case. On Friday, more than 13,000 contracts of the $30 out-of-the-money (OTM) put option expiring May 16 changed hands as the ETF rose 1.7% to $57.91, according to data from Amberdata. Volume in the $35 put option expiring Jan. 16, 2026, topped 10,000 contracts. Most of the activity probably stems from market participants looking to generate passive income through "cash-secured put selling" rather than outright purchase of the options as bearish bets, according to Greg Magadini, Amberdata's director of derivatives. A put seller, offering insurance against price drops in return for a premium, is obligated to purchase the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific expiration date. (That's opposed to the buyer of the put, who has the right but not the obligation to sell the asset.) That means savvy traders often write OTM puts to acquire the underlying asset at a lower price while pocketing the premium received by selling the put option. They do so by continuously maintaining the cash required to purchase the asset if the owner of the put option exercises their right to sell the asset. Hence, the strategy is called "cash-secured" selling of puts. In IBIT's case, sellers of the $35 put expiring in January 2026 will keep the premium if IBIT stays above that level until expiry. If IBIT drops below $35, the put sellers must buy the ETF at that price while keeping the premium received. The sellers of the $30 put expiring in May next year face a similar payoff scenario. "The $35 Puts for Jan 2026 traded +10k contract with an IV range of 73.52% to 69.94%, VWAP at 70.75% suggests net selling from the street… potentially Cash Secured put selling flows (for traders who missed the rally)," Magadini said in a note shared with CoinDesk. Saxo Bank's analyst suggested cash-secured put selling as the preferred strategy in Nvidia early this year. Overall, IBIT call options, which offer an asymmetric upside to buyers, continue to trade pricer than puts. As of Friday, call-put skews, with maturities ranging from five to 126 days, were positive, signaling relative richness of implied volatility for calls. The bullish sentiment is consistent with the pricing in options tied to bitcoin and trading on Deribit. On Friday, IBIT recorded a net inflow of $393 million, representing the majority of the total inflow of $428.9 million across the 11 spot ETFs listed in the U.S, according to data tracked by Farside Investors.

Title: Is Tilray Brands (TLRY) Among the Best Cannabis Stocks To Invest In?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 11 Best Cannabis Stocks To Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Tilray Brands, Inc. (NASDAQ:TLRY) stands against the other best cannabis stocks to invest in. The history of cannabis cultivation in America dates back to the early colonists, who grew hemp for textiles and rope. The plant was also widely used as a patent medicine during the 19th and early 20th centuries, described in the United States Pharmacopeia for the first time in 1850. Several political and racial factors led to the criminalization of cannabis in 1937 with the passage of the Marijuana Tax Act, but its legal status is now finally changing in many places. READ ALSO: 20 States with the Highest Weed Consumption in the US The United States of America is the country that consumes the most weed in the world. As we mentioned in our article – 30 Cities with the Highest Weed Consumption in the US – the American legal cannabis industry fared well in 2023 as legal sales across the 38 states that allow some form of regulated marijuana reached $28.8 billion, a 10.3% increase from the previous year. Meanwhile, the legal cannabis industry also added 22,952 new jobs last year – a sign that the national business climate has somewhat stabilized following the turmoil of the previous two years. According to the 2024 Vangst Jobs Report, there were over 440,445 jobs supported by legal cannabis nationwide as of early 2024, an increase of 5.4% from 2023. The increasing legalization of cannabis and rising acceptance of its use for medical purposes are the key factors fueling the industry. Growth is also expected to come from new markets. One such example is Nebraska’s vote in favor of legalizing medical marijuana last month. As of the writing of this article, 24 states have legalized recreational weed in America, in addition to the District of Columbia. However, possessing or selling marijuana remains a crime under federal law, punishable by prison time and fines. In a significant setback for America’s legal cannabis industry, Florida voters rejected a ballot measure to legalize recreational marijuana in November. The measure, known as Amendment 3, got 55.9% support, failing to meet the required 60% threshold. This was despite historic levels of funding, a rigorous advertising campaign, and even an endorsement from President-elect Donald Trump. Florida, with its population of 20 million people, is already home to the country’s largest medical marijuana market, boasting an annual revenue of $2 billion. The Sunshine State is also a popular tourist destination (especially during spring break) and attracts more than 140 million tourists every year. If Amendment 3 had been passed, Florida was expected to become a $6 billion cannabis market by 2026. Through the Smart & Safe Campaign, Florida’s cannabis companies and individual donors collectively contributed more than $150 million to get legalization enacted into law, with most of it coming from the largest medical marijuana operator in the state. On the other hand, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who aggressively campaigned against Amendment 3, spent an estimated $50 million of taxpayer money on radio and television ads to successfully convince enough voters to reject the measure. Meanwhile, hedge fund billionaire Ken Griffin also came out against legalization and donated $12 million to the Vote No On 3 campaign. This setback inevitably had an impact on cannabis stocks, which witnessed a downturn following the news of the rejection. Amplify Alternative Harvest ETF, the first US ETF to target the global cannabis industry, has fallen by almost 30% since November 4, closing at $2.33 on December 13, 2024. Florida voters will now have to wait for two more years before cannabis legalization can get back on the ballot. A laboratory with white-coated technicians carefully measuring out cannabis extracts. To collect data for this article, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds and picked the top 11 companies operating in the cannabis sector with the highest number of hedge fund investors. When two or more companies had the same number of hedge funds investing in them, we ranked them by the revenue of their last financial year instead. Following are the Best Cannabis Stocks According to Most Hedge Funds. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 16 The New York-based Tilray Brands, Inc. (NASDAQ:TLRY) has a highly diversified global portfolio – operating in more than 20 countries with businesses in medical adult-use cannabis, beverages, spirits, wellness products, and a vast array of consumer-connected lifestyle brands. The core business of Tilray Brands, Inc. (NASDAQ:TLRY) is cannabis and it is the number one cannabis business in Canada, the leading medical cannabis business across Europe, and the top branded hemp business in North America. The company has lately been very active in acquiring other industry players to expand its presence and the strategy seems to be paying off. For example, its acquisition of Redecan in June 2023 has helped it gain a strong footing in categories like pre-rolls, oils, and capsules. As a result, Redecan has now moved up to the number six position in Canada as reported by Hifyre data, and now the brand is also launching in Australia. Moreover, in September, Tilray entered the lucrative US THC beverage market with a range of Delta-9 THC mocktails and seltzers through its newly formed Tilray Alternative Beverages business unit. Tilray Brands, Inc. (NASDAQ:TLRY) forayed into the alcohol sector last year when it acquired eight beer and beverage brands from Anheuser-Busch InBev for an undisclosed amount, making it the 5th largest craft beer business in the US with a 4.5% market share. To further strengthen its craft portfolio, the company announced in August that it had agreed to acquire another four craft beer brands from Molson Coors – Hop Valley Brewing Company, Terrapin Beer Co., Revolver Brewing, and Atwater Brewery. This venture seems to be bearing fruit, as Tilray Brands, Inc. (NASDAQ:TLRY)’s alcohol business now accounts for 28% of its revenue. Overall, the company’s beverage segment, including craft beer, spirits, non-alcoholic beers, and other drinks grew 132% in net revenue YoY during the fiscal Q1 of 2025. With 16 hedge fund investors tracked by IM at the end of Q3 2024, Tilray Brands, Inc. (NASDAQ:TLRY) was also included in our list of the Best Beer Stocks to Buy Now. Overall, TLRY ranks 2nd on our list of the best cannabis stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential for TLRY to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Cramer on Delta Airlines (DAL): Best of Breed with Premium Revenue Boost

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Talked About These 6 Airline Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) stands against the other airline stocks that Jim Cramer has talked about. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently discussed the current state of airline stocks, many of which have seen impressive gains in recent months. “I always say that these typically make better trades than investments, they're very different. So, after this kind of run, my gut tells me maybe to ring the register before the music stops and the light comes on. But I’m also open to the idea that maybe things, things can change. If there's reason to believe that the airlines are suddenly less cyclical, less boom and bust, then maybe this time really is different.” Cramer identified a few key factors driving the surge in airline stocks. Earlier this year, the airline sector was weighed down by concerns over consumer spending. While these concerns have not entirely dissipated, the Federal Reserve’s rate cuts have reduced some of the pressure. Cramer pointed out that while consumer spending has cooled from last year’s levels, travel has remained a consistent area of demand. He said that consumer sentiment has also been improving over the past few months, providing further support for this view. READ ALSO Jim Cramer Discussed 18 Companies That Hit $100 Billion in Market Cap in 2024 and 10 Best Jim Cramer Stocks to Buy According to Analysts One of the most significant positive changes for the airline industry, according to Cramer, is the resurgence of business travelers post-pandemic. Business travelers tend to be less price-sensitive than leisure travelers, which provides a reliable revenue stream for airlines. He went on to say: “I'm much more impressed by some big structural change in the industry that many people aren't noticing. The single most important positive development for the airline over the past few months is the fact that domestic airline capacity has stopped going up as much as in previous years.” He said that after the pandemic, airlines began ramping up their route offerings to capitalize on the surge in demand, known as the revenge travel boom. However, as Cramer explained, this expansion of capacity has historically been problematic for the industry. During boom periods, airlines add too many routes and flights, but when demand slows, they are left with excess capacity, which erodes their pricing power. This, in turn, leads to lower profitability. In contrast, Cramer observed that since the first half of 2024, the airlines have been much more disciplined, with capacity growth slowing considerably. While capacity grew around 7% in the first half of the year, it appears that in the second half, the growth will be in the low single digits. Cramer also pointed out that part of the reason for this newfound capacity discipline is that many low-cost carriers, which have been a major driver of supply growth in the past two decades, are now struggling. So, can airline stocks continue their upward trajectory? Cramer believes the strength in the sector can persist as long as the airlines maintain their discipline with capacity management. However, he expressed some uncertainty about how long this trend will last. For now, though, he said that the airlines are saying the right things, with all the major players appearing to act in concert in a way Cramer has never seen before. “In the end, the airline stocks have been white hot for months now, in part because the economy's doing better, but mainly because the industry stopped adding new planes willy-nilly and it finally gave them pricing power. The bottom line: As long as the airlines don't add too many new flights, I think the major carriers like United, Delta, and American, they can keep on flying.” For this article, we compiled a list of 6 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on December 9. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 57 Cramer said that Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) is “best of breed” and noted that the stock has gained quite a lot in the past several months. “We need to talk about the remarkable run in the airline stocks over the past few months… Delta Airlines… we consider the best of breed, has soared nearly 70%.” Delta (NYSE:DAL) is a major provider of air transportation services, catering to both passengers and cargo across a wide range of domestic and international routes. During its Investor Day, the airline projected strong sales growth in 2025, anticipating a boost in revenue due to a solid economy and continued demand for premium and international travel. The company expects revenue to grow in the mid-teens in the coming year, though it also anticipates that costs, excluding fuel, will rise. Premium products have become an increasingly important source of revenue for it. The company reported that its premium offerings, including premium seats and its loyalty program, account for 57% of its overall revenue. In comparison, main cabin seating now represents 43% of Delta’s earnings. The company has also set a target to see sales from premium seats alone surpass revenue from coach seats by 2027. Delta (NYSE:DAL) President, Glenn Hauenstein, has previously discussed improvements in the company’s capacity management in previous statements to investors. He noted that the excess capacity observed during the summer months began to improve by August, helping to boost revenue trends as the airline entered the fall season, typically a quieter period for travel. Overall, DAL ranks first on our list of airline stocks that Jim Cramer has talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of DAL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than DAL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Talked About These 6 Airline Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL) stands against the other airline stocks that Jim Cramer has talked about. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently discussed the current state of airline stocks, many of which have seen impressive gains in recent months. “I always say that these typically make better trades than investments, they're very different. So, after this kind of run, my gut tells me maybe to ring the register before the music stops and the light comes on. But I’m also open to the idea that maybe things, things can change. If there's reason to believe that the airlines are suddenly less cyclical, less boom and bust, then maybe this time really is different.” Cramer identified a few key factors driving the surge in airline stocks. Earlier this year, the airline sector was weighed down by concerns over consumer spending. While these concerns have not entirely dissipated, the Federal Reserve’s rate cuts have reduced some of the pressure. Cramer pointed out that while consumer spending has cooled from last year’s levels, travel has remained a consistent area of demand. He said that consumer sentiment has also been improving over the past few months, providing further support for this view.

Business travelers tend to be less price-sensitive than leisure travelers, which provides a reliable revenue stream for airlines. He went on to say: “I'm much more impressed by some big structural change in the industry that many people aren't noticing. The single most important positive development for the airline over the past few months is the fact that domestic airline capacity has stopped going up as much as in previous years.” He said that after the pandemic, airlines began ramping up their route offerings to capitalize on the surge in demand, known as the revenge travel boom. However, as Cramer explained, this expansion of capacity has historically been problematic for the industry. During boom periods, airlines add too many routes and flights, but when demand slows, they are left with excess capacity, which erodes their pricing power. This, in turn, leads to lower profitability. In contrast, Cramer observed that since the first half of 2024, the airlines have been much more disciplined, with capacity growth slowing considerably. While capacity grew around 7% in the first half of the year, it appears that in the second half, the growth will be in the low single digits. Cramer also pointed out that part of the reason for this newfound capacity discipline is that many low-cost carriers, which have been a major driver of supply growth in the past two decades, are now struggling. So, can airline stocks continue their upward trajectory? Cramer believes the strength in the sector can persist as long as the airlines maintain their discipline with capacity management. However, he expressed some uncertainty about how long this trend will last. For now, though, he said that the airlines are saying the right things, with all the major players appearing to act in concert in a way Cramer has never seen before. “In the end, the airline stocks have been white hot for months now, in part because the economy's doing better, but mainly because the industry stopped adding new planes willy-nilly and it finally gave them pricing power. The bottom line: As long as the airlines don't add too many new flights, I think the major carriers like United, Delta, and American, they can keep on flying.” For this article, we compiled a list of 6 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on December 9. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 54 Highlighting that United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL) stock has risen over the past month, Cramer also noted its management’s comment on capacity management. “United is up an astounding 159%… Let's consider the case of United Airlines, best performer. When the company reported second-quarter results in July, they noted that the capacity had grown 8% year-over-year that quarter, reflecting the industry-wide trends. But they also said that they believed that that trend was ending. United explained that the industry would be removing unprofitable capacity in the second half of the year, especially in the fourth quarter. In October, when United reported… CEO Scott Kirby… very proudly said, I'm gonna quote it, ‘The inflection we spoke about on our last call has happened and we're seeing unprofitable capacity begin to exit the market, leading to the expected domestic yield improvement.’ The company's chief commercial officer, Andrew Nocella then added, ‘United's domestic capacity in 2024 was shaped with the expectation that the industry would remove unprofitable capacity in earnest in Q4. As a result, United expanded slower than most during the first three quarters of the year when capacity dynamics were less favorable. But importantly, our timing is right, tilting our growth to the quarter where the industry conditions would be the best.’ I can't believe that these guys are saying this stuff.” United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) operates as a major provider of air transportation services, offering both passenger and cargo services. According to the airline, domestic passenger revenue per available seat mile (RASM) showed a slight year-over-year improvement in both August and September, marking a significant recovery from earlier in the quarter when it had been down by 4%. Management attributed this positive shift to the maturation of capacity added in 2022 and 2023, which helped drive the improved RASM results. Looking ahead, management expressed optimism regarding United’s performance in Latin America, citing the ongoing capacity rationalization by low-margin airlines in the region. They expect this trend to benefit the airline’s operations in the coming quarters. Additionally, United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) management noted that revenue trends also improved across most geographic areas, helped by the industry’s capacity rationalization and a decline in fuel prices, which provided some relief to cost pressures. Overall, UAL ranks 2nd on our list of airline stocks that Jim Cramer has talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of UAL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than UAL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: 2024 was big for bitcoin. States could see a crypto policy blitz in 2025 in spite of the risks

The new year will usher in the bitcoin-friendly administration of President-elect Donald Trump and an expanding lobbying effort in statehouses HARRISBURG, Pa. -- The new year will usher in the bitcoin-friendly administration of President-elect Donald Trump and an expanding lobbying effort in statehouses that, together, could push states to become more open to crypto and for public pension funds and treasuries to buy into it. Proponents of the uniquely volatile commodity argue it is a valuable hedge against inflation, similar to gold. Many bitcoin enthusiasts and investors are quick to criticize government-backed currencies as prone to devaluation and say increased government buy-in will stabilize bitcoin's future price swings, give it more legitimacy and further boost an already rising price. But the risks are significant. Critics say a crypto investment is highly speculative, with so much unknown about projecting its future returns, and warn that investors should be prepared to lose money. Only a couple public pension funds have invested in cryptocurrency and a new U.S. Government Accountability Office study on 401(k) plan investments in crypto, issued in recent days, warned it has “uniquely high volatility” and that it found no standard approach for projecting the future returns of crypto. It has already been a landmark year for crypto, with bitcoin hitting $100,000, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approving the first exchange-traded funds that hold bitcoin and crypto enthusiasts being cheered by Trump's promise to make the United States the “bitcoin superpower” of the world. Lawmakers in more states can expect to see bills in 2025 to make them crypto-friendly as analysts say crypto is becoming a powerful lobby, bitcoin miners build new installations and venture capitalists underwrite a growing tech sector that caters to cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, a new crypto-friendly federal government under Trump and Congress could consider legislation from Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyoming, to create a federal bitcoin reserve on which states can piggyback. A bill introduced last month in Pennsylvania's House of Representatives sought to authorize the state's treasurer and public pension funds to invest in bitcoin. It went nowhere before the legislative session ended, but it caused a stir. “I had a friend who is a rep down the road text me, ‘Oh my god, I’m getting so many emails and phone calls to my office,' more than he ever did about any other bill,” said the measure's sponsor, Republican Mike Cabell. Cabell — a bitcoin enthusiast who lost his reelection bid — expects his bill to be reintroduced by a colleague. And leaders of bitcoin advocacy group Satoshi Action say they expect bills based on their model bill to be introduced in at least 10 other states next year. Keith Brainard, research director for the National Association of State Retirement Administrators, said he doesn’t expect many public pension fund investment professionals, who oversee nearly $6 trillion in assets, to invest in crypto. Pension fund professionals take risks they deem to be appropriate, but bitcoin investing has a short track record, might only fit into a niche asset class and may not fit the risk-to-reward profile they seek. “There might be a bit of dabbling in bitcoin,” Brainard said. “But it’s difficult to envision a scenario in which pension funds right now are willing to make a commitment.” In Louisiana, Treasurer John Fleming helped make the state the first to introduce a system by which people can pay a government agency in cryptocurrencies. Fleming said he's not trying to promote cryptocurrency, but rather sees the step as a recognition that government must innovate and be flexible in helping people make financial transactions with the state. He said he would never invest his money, or the state's, in crypto. Fleming recalled meeting with a bitcoin lobbyist recently and came away unconvinced that bitcoin makes for a good investment. “My concern is that at some point it’ll stop growing and then people will want to cash in,” Fleming said. “And when they do, it could tank the value of a bitcoin.” In Pennsylvania, Treasury Department officials said they have the authority to decide for themselves if cryptocurrencies meet the agency's investment standards under state law and don't need new legislation. Still, a highly volatile asset is ill-suited to the agency's need for predictability, considering it writes millions of checks a year. The overwhelming majority of the roughly $60 billion it invests at any given time is in short-term, conservative investments designed for an investment period of months, officials there said. Pension boards, which invest on a 30-year time horizon, may already hold small investments in companies involved in mining, trading and storing cryptocurrencies. But they have been slow to embrace bitcoin. That could change, said Mark Palmer, managing director and a senior research analyst at The Benchmark Company in New York. Pension boards got investment tools they like this year when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the first exchange-traded funds that hold bitcoin and, in October, approved listings of options on those funds, Palmer said. Many “are likely in the process of getting up to speed on what it means to invest in bitcoin and kicking the tires, so to speak, and that’s a process that typically takes a while at the institutional level,” Palmer said. Several major asset managers like BlackRock, Invesco and Fidelity have bitcoin ETFs. In May, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board became the first state to invest when it bought $160 million worth of shares in two ETFs, or about 0.1% of its assets. It later scaled back that investment to $104 million in one ETF, as of Sept. 30. A spokesperson declined to discuss it. Michigan's state investment board later reported about $18 million in bitcoin ETF purchases while a candidate for New Jersey governor, Steven Fulop, said that if elected he would push the state's pension fund to invest in crypto. Fulop, the Democratic mayor of Jersey City, just across the Hudson River from Manhattan, has been preparing for months to buy bitcoin ETF shares for up to 2% of the city's $250 million employee pension fund. “We were ahead of the curve," Fulop said. “And I think that’s what you’re eventually going to see is this is widely accepted, with regard to exposure in all pension funds, some sort of exposure.” ___ Follow Marc Levy on X at: https://x.com/timelywriter. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events
