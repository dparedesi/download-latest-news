Title: Aave Labs Announces App Release On Apple’s Platform: Features And Expectations
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/aave-labs-announces-app-release-on-apples-platform/
Time Published: 2025-11-18T04:00:41Z

Aave Labs, the developer behind the decentralized cryptocurrency lending platform Aave (AAVE), announced on Monday its intentions to launch a new app on Apple’s App Store. According to a report from Fortune, this new product is designed to function similarly to a traditional savings account, but with higher yields than those offered by traditional finance banks. Users can earn a minimum interest rate of 5% on their deposits, which can be funded through bank accounts or debit cards. The app will utilize stablecoins alongside the Aave protocol to offer these financial services. Aave has established itself as a key player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and crypto lending sectors, boasting over $3.23 trillion in cumulative deposits, nearly $1 trillion in total originated loan volume and $ billion in total interest paid, according to the platform’s website. While DeFi protocols often provide users with higher interest rates compared to conventional banking, they also carry heightened risks, such as the potential for hacks and the absence of government backing. However, Stani Kulechov, the founder and CEO of Aave Labs, assured users of the protocol’s safety. He pointed out that Aave has never encountered an exploit in its five-year history, emphasizing the dual layers of security related to both the market economics and the software code, which has been audited by multiple companies. The forthcoming launch of the Aave app arrives at a time when the gap between traditional financial institutions and crypto-native firms is closing. Major players like BlackRock are adopting Bitcoin (BTC) through the exchange-traded fund (ETF) sector. Stripe has integrated stablecoins into its offerings, and JPMorgan Chase has been actively developing blockchain solutions. In response, crypto firms are increasingly focusing on attracting mainstream customers. The US crypto exchange Kraken, for example, has newly introduced its own payments app, while various others are working to create bank-like products using stablecoins. Kulechov remarked, “Typically, DeFi has been accessible to very savvy, professional users. The next step for DeFi is to bring more direct access for consumers.” Kulechov, a figure in the DeFi movement since launching the protocol in 2020, has expanded the company’s offerings to include a crypto wallet, a decentralized stablecoin, and a protocol for social media. In October, the firm made headlines by acquiring the stablecoin company Stable Finance for an undisclosed amount. Kulechov noted that the acquisition also enhanced their consumer-focused experience, allowing the team to move more swiftly and improve their product offerings. While the broader crypto market continues its downtrend, the price of AAVE saw a 2% uptick following the announcement. At the time of writing, it was trading at $171.87 per token.

Title: VanEck Solana ETF goes live, Grayscale DOGE ETF expected on Monday

The flood of crypto ETFs has begun, with VanEck’s Solana ETF launching on Monday, and many more ETFs expected to go live over the next week. VanEck has launched the US’s third exchange-traded fund (ETF) featuring Solana staking, as more altcoin-tied funds are set to enter the market soon. The VanEck Solana ETF (VSOL) launched on Monday, joining similar funds from Bitwise and Grayscale that debuted late in October and have jointly seen over $380 million in inflows. Like Bitwise and Grayscale’s ETFs, VSOL offers staking yields, where Solana (SOL) is locked up on the blockchain to earn rewards. It has also waived its 0.3% fee until Feb. 17 or until it reaches $1 billion in assets in a bid to compete. Asset managers have been flooding the market with crypto ETFs after the Securities and Exchange Commission changed its listing standards in September, allowing for faster approvals that don’t require an assessment of each fund. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said on Monday that the Fidelity Solana ETF (FSOL) is set to launch on Tuesday, competing with three existing similar funds that charge a 0.25% fee. “Easily the biggest asset manager in this category with BlackRock sitting out,” he added. Balchunas said he expects a Dogecoin (DOGE) ETF from Grayscale to launch on Nov. 24, based on an amended regulatory filing earlier this month kicking off a 20-day period where it can launch if the SEC doesn’t respond. The Grayscale Dogecoin Trust (DOGE) is a conversion from its existing fund and would trade on the New York Stock Exchange, which must still file to list the ETF. “We’ll see, won’t be 100% till exchange notice, but based on SEC guidance, it looks good,” Balchunas added. Related: XRP traders hope fresh wave of ETF launches will restore the bull trend If Grayscale’s fund launches next week, it’ll be the first Dogecoin ETF in the US that will be able to directly hold the memecoin. Asset issuers REX Shares and Osprey Funds jointly launched a DOGE ETF in mid-September, registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which limits its investment to a wholly owned offshore subsidiary that holds the cryptocurrency. Bitwise could also see its spot Dogecoin ETF launch late next week, after a change in its regulatory filing for the product on Nov. 6 triggered a 20-day launch timer, unless the SEC intervenes.

Title: It’s 21st anniversary time for World of Warcraft!

NEXT | Get in the Thanksgiving spirit with these super cute Turkeys! Unless you were paying attention when you logged into World of Warcraft yesterday, you may have easily been able to miss that it’s anniversary time again — which means the return of a lot of the things from the 20th anniversary celebration is back for a second run. The biggest difference is that now the game is 21 years old! Congratulations to World of Warcraft on being old enough to drink in bars in the United States. Frankly, the idea I’ve been playing that long makes me need a drink, but instead, let’s run down what you’ll find as part of the anniversary! Once again, the big open area outside of the Caverns of Time has been turned into an activity-filled celebration area. You’ll find a similar setup to last year, including the experience and reputation buff — you get 10% to both just for logging in, and an additional 10% for completing various activities around the celebration. (Shouldn’t that be 11% at this point?) Interestingly, Legion Remix characters are also getting the default 10% bonus, enabling fully maxed out Timerunners to have 410% bonus experience during the anniversary. Why not make it a tiny bit more ridiculous? Many of the same activities from last year are present, as well — Mount Mania, Storytime with Lorewalker Cho, the transmog contest, world bosses ravaging Tanaris, that thing in Silithus with Chromie, it’s all here. If you missed out on any of the Secrets of Azeroth event, that seems to be back again with no timegating at all, so you can just zoom right through it. You’ll also find that the Blackrock Depths raid is back — in LFR difficulty, at least. A lot of the rewards from last year are back, as well as ways to earn the Bronze Celebration Tokens you’ll need to buy them, so if you missed out on any rewards like the high-definition Tier 2 sets and you’ve been kicking yourself about it for a year, now’s your chance! Also, it was a late addition to the party, but the Trader’s Gilded Brutosaur and its $90 USD price tag has returned to the cash shop. While it was originally tied to the 20th Anniversary, now it appears it’s come back for this one, so don’t let FOMO trick you into buying it — we may have years of Brutosaurs to come. There are also a couple of new things to pick up for anniversary aficionados. Traeya, who sells the high-definition Tier 2 armor sets, now also sells a Loyal Watchman cosmetic gear set that will make you look like the guard you’ve always dreamed about being, for a grand total of 230 Timewarped Badges for the entire set. Additionally, Notary Grably — the goblin who had a whole array of expansion-themed titles for purchase — has added Khaz Algar Enthusiast for 100 Timewarped Badges. And… that’s it! There are only a couple things missing entirely this year, and some of them are not entirely a surprise. One is Storekeeper Reginald, who sells you items from prior anniversary events; his dialogue last year hinted that he’d only return every five years, and he’s true to his word, apparently. Also not present is Bobadormu, who you may have already noticed sells the same exact goods (such as scaling classic gear and Season of Discovery class exclusive item replicas) during Classic Timewalking — since he’s tied to that event, and not the anniversary, he’s missing this year. One surprising thing missing, however, is any version of the Blackrock Depths raid that isn’t LFR. Moira is present, but does not offer to send players into Normal and Heroic Blackrock Depths, and the vendors you would normally exchange Timewarped Relic Coffer Keys with after the raid are also missing. It may be that the harder version was meant to be exclusive to the 20th anniversary, but it’s slightly disappointing to not see this return — it was hard as nails last time on Heroic, and I’m sure some players would love to take another swing at the higher difficulty of this raid. For now, we’ll just have to wait and see if Blizzard switches it back on! Blizzard Watch is a safe space for all readers.

Turn-based tactics RPG Demonschool and a new SpongeBob game lead this week's latest Xbox games. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Another new week is here, with another wave of games soon to populate the Xbox storefront. This is something of a quieter week, with fewer "heavy hitters" as the big first and third-party titles have mainly launched in preparation for the holidays. Still, there are some games worth noticing, including Necrosoft's Demonschool, an eerie turn-based tactics role-playing game set on a strange island filled with monsters. Demonschool was initially supposed to arrive back in September, but was delayed due to the sudden arrival of Team Cherry's highly anticipated Hollow Knight: Silksong. If you missed last week's titles, be sure to check them out as well. Now, here are all the new games launching on Xbox this week, listed below. So, there you go, that's the new games on the Xbox store this week. Personally, I'm mainly just expecting to continue mopping up Achievements in titles I've been playing for the last couple of weeks, but I do want to check out Demonschool.

Title: Harvard now owns nearly half a billion dollars worth of Bitcoin, filings show

Harvard is home to top intellectuals, famous alumni, and, more recently, a sizable hoard of Bitcoin. The university has more than $442 million dollars in the BlackRock-issued ETF called iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which provides exposure to the cryptocurrency in the form of stock, according to filings released on Friday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In 2025, major companies and institutions have lined up to invest in crypto, including those from Wall Street, Silicon Valley, and increasingly, the Ivy League. Brown University has also disclosed roughly $14 million in crypto ETF holdings. Harvard has more money in the Bitcoin ETF than it does in any other stock, including its stakes in mainstay companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, and Amazon. While half a billion dollars in IBIT is nothing to sneeze at, it accounts for less than 1% of the university’s nearly $57 billion endowment. Harvard did not respond to a request for comment about its decision to invest in Bitcoin. Eric Balchunas, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, posted on X on Friday that Harvard’s investment in IBIT was “as good a validation as an ETF can get.” The fund Harvard invested in is one of the first spot crypto ETFs to launch in the U.S. When it went public in January 2024, it marked the end of a more than decade-long battle between the crypto sector and the SEC. It was also the first time that U.S. investors could invest in Bitcoin through their brokerage accounts, rather than through crypto exchanges. Even with a recent slump in Bitcoin prices, IBIT’s total market cap is well over $70 billion. Although Harvard’s $442 million stake in BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF is yet another sign of crypto’s growing institutional acceptance, a year of wins for the industry hasn’t translated to a big price increase for Bitcoin. In the last year, Bitcoin has gone up less than 0.5%, a fraction of the S&P 500’s 13% rise during that time. Bitcoin shot up to its all-time high price of almost $126,000 last month but is down roughly 27% to less than $92,000.

Title: Inside Commercial Observer’s 2025 Fall Finance Forum

© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy Some of the biggest names in commercial real estate finance discussed the state of capital markets during Commercial Observer’s National Finance Forum, as the conversation touched on an improved lending market, especially for securitized products, where opportunities are found in a highly competitive credit space, and how lenders can best protect themselves. The symposium, held Nov. 13 at The Metropolitan Club at 1 East 60th Street in Midtown Manhattan, opened with a keynote general discussion between Chad Tredway, managing director, global head of real estate at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, and Bonnie Neuman, partner and global head of real estate group at law firm Sidley Austin, one moderated by CO Executive Editor Cathy Cunningham. Tredway began by noting that since CRE capital markets hit bottom at the end of 2024, J.P. Morgan has seen each aspect of its entire $80 billion CRE portfolio appreciate every quarter since then and that investors are taking notice. “Real estate still has room to recover, but we’re finding people shift out of cash, shift out of equities, and shift out of fixed-income and they’re coming back into real estate, and we firmly believe 2026 should be a great vintage,” said Tredway. “The headline is real estate is coming back.” Neuman noted that while the year started off with lingering valuation issues due to high interest rates, the valuation disconnect has evaporated, interest rates have dropped, and the office market has seen sales finally gain some momentum, due to commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) financing aiding the repricing of risk as conditions have shifted. “In the securitized space, where I spent most of my time, it’s been a roaring year, with a huge amount of originations,” she said, noting the CMBS market will have at least $150 billion in originations in 2025. “It’s been a busy year in the syndicated and balance sheet securitized loan markets.” Neuman emphasized the transaction market for debt has become “highly competitive,” due to the re-emergence of commercial banks, as well as the growth of debt funds, private credit, bank-backed leverage, and bridge leverage gaps being closed by preferred equity, which she called “a bit of trend recently in some transactions.” Tredway closed his remarks by stating how J.P. Morgan is moving as quickly as it can to capture value in the market by buying assets below replacement cost, where cash yields should improve as interest rates come down in the months ahead. “For those that have equity, the time is now,” he said. “We strongly believe that we’re going into a massive tailwind here, and if rates continue to go down it gets even better.” The next panel, moderated by Jay Neveloff, chair of U.S. real estate at HSF Kramer, examined the state of the market in 2025 and what we should expect in 2026 and beyond with a diverse collection of lenders, brokers and investors. Kyle Jeffers, chief investment officer at Acore Capital, said his firm is “aggressively going back” into the market, with most lenders lending at a basis that’s been significantly reset below replacement cost, and that his firm recently financed an office deal that was 30 percent the previous owner’s basis. “You can’t predict the bottom, but it certainly feels like we bounced off the bottom and are on our way up,” said Jeffers. “So this is the time to be leaning into the market.” Nick Scribani, vice chairman at Newmark, noted that investment sale activity is up 20 percent compared to 2024, when the market had been muted due to the high cost of debt and most balance sheet lenders chose to remain on the sidelines. But the last 12 months has been “a proliferation of repressed energy,” Scribani said, concerning the deployment of capital, especially into the CMBS market. “There’s so much ability to access capital, particularly in the debt marketplace, where you can actually borrow with positive leverage,” he said. “People are coming off the sidelines as quickly as they can, because you’re going to miss the train if you’re still sidelined.” Karen Ramos, managing director and head of distribution and asset rotation Americas at Crédit Agricole CIB, agreed that commercial banks have returned from the sidelines, but the real liquidity story is debt funds and private credit increasing their activity to finance huge deals, mainly for data centers, with back leverage. “We’re seeing the debt funds and private credit come in such a huge way in terms of big commitments as much as $2 billion,” she said. “And that’s bringing a lot of the liquidity from a new source, in addition to the typical banks.” Aaron Kraus, managing director and head of market development and strategy at Nuveen Green Capital, spoke of what it’s like to finance C-PACE projects, which typically fill gaps in ground-up construction capital stacks, and how the underwriting among debt funds is often too high for those deals, but with spreads tightening in recent months, the entire financing space has become more competitive. “Spreads have come in so tightly in the last six months,” Kraus emphasized. “On the terms we’re seeing, from both debt funds and banks, it’s a much tighter rate environment,and everyone is competing.” Neveloff then asked the lenders how they remain competitive and find an advantage in a market awash in borrower friendly capital and filled with hundreds of new sources for CRE loans that are changing the game on debt service coverage ratios and loan-to-value ratios. Yorick Starr, managing director at Invesco, pointed to prioritizing quality sponsorship when underwriting and assessing deals. “We’re first and foremost all about the sponsor,” he said. “We’ve seen it time and time again, if you lend to the right people, structure aside, you typically get paid back or they have enough money that they’ll figure it out.” He also said that as a firm that primarily invests equity into deals, Invesco underwrites the quality of the real estate aggressively. “Is it real estate that we want to own? Is it a market that we currently own in? Do we understand the asset class?” he said. “Am I lending to the right person on the right asset in the right market?” Jeffers pointed to leaning in to relationships formed in the fires of COVID-19, the regional banking crisis of 2023, and the recent interest rate upheaval. “You compete on relationships,” he said. “What we’ve learned in the last couple of years is knowing your lender, knowing what your relationship is, and knowing how you work together in hard times makes a difference.” The third panel examined market volatility and was hosted by Michael Vines, partner at Fried Frank. Ironically, the discussion first examined how strong the market is right now and how little volatility there is relative to previous years in this decade. John Lippmann, head of U.S. real estate capital markets at Barings, pointed ot the strength of the CMBS market, where issuance stands at $106 billion, up 15 percent year-to-date, largely fueled by a surge of single-asset, single-borrower (SASB) financing up nearly 30 percent. He noted that commercial bank balance sheets right now hold more than $250 billion in capital available to loan as back leverage or note-on-note financings for debt funds. “That number may grow as we see continued regulatory benefits for banks to be the Senior lender of choice but maybe not the direct lender of choice to commercial real estate,” Lippmann said. The topic then turned to distress. Natalia Sosnina, head of acquisitions at Terra Strategies, said that it’s become harder for her firm to find deals during a time of distress due to the competition for opportunistic debt buys — with office buildings being the only asset class providing discounts. “Most of the time, even if the borrower is in distress and the situation of the building is bad, lenders are not really in distress — they all want close to par,” she said. “For us, it’s very difficult to assume that kind of risk to buy a distressed note and then pay a lender close to par.” Andrew Huggett, managing director of loan syndications at First Citizens Bank, said that the volatility amid a new, highly competitive lending landscape has made it necessary for banks to make large whole loan amounts and leave them on their books or use syndication agreements with other lenders to win large CRE deals. “You won’t win a deal unless you’re willing to either fully take it down, book and hold [the loan], or raise your hand and be willing to selectively syndicate,” he said. Shawn Katz, president of Silverstein Capital Partners, said that with so much liquidity in the market, especially in private credit, his firm is finding opportunities lending into broken capital stacks that need just a bit of equity to close a persistent gap, rather than riskier whole loans into big construction projects. “Our underwriting doesn’t change, it stays consistent, and when you look at risk-adjusted returns, where we lend, we’re seeing the most opportunity in the gap equity space,” he said. “And where we’re delivering whole loans in ground-up construction, or value-add, those risk-adjusted returns aren’t there.” When asked how lenders and investors are viewing risk in today’s market, David Friedman, chief credit officer and head of non-agency production and syndications at Arbor Realty Trust, said that it all comes down to who one is lending to or investing with, especially construction loans, bridge and mezzanine financings, or preferred equity. “We’re looking under the hood, not just at the asset, but who is the borrower, who is the sponsor, what is their equity contribution,” he said. “We lend on real estate, but we lend to people — you can see structure erode away or be totally structured up with the wrong sponsor.” The ensuing panel “The Role & Impact of Non-Bank Lenders in the Market Today” discussed the increased role of private credit over the past decade and a half as banks and insurance companies look to reduce their exposure to CRE risk. Michael Lavipour, senior managing director, head of lending at Affinius Capital, said private lenders have filled a void for providing necessary recap funding for 2021 vintage development loans issued when interest rates were at near zero borrowing levels. Lavipour also noted that non-bank lenders are also increasingly lending on behalf of insurance companies. Lavipour said he expects that the growth of private lenders will likely slow down in the couple years similar to what happened with the CMBS market 10 years ago. He stressed, however, that the last 90 days has seen more competition which has pushed leverage levels up about 5 percent. “When you find a deal that makes a good credit, you lean in on it. And when you find a deal that is being bid like crazy, and you are kind of wishy-washy on it, you take a step back, and if you can’t deploy you can’t deploy,” Lavipour said. “It’s not an easy market from that perspective, but there is still opportunity for sure with a large number of deals.” The non-bank lenders panel — moderated by Christine O’Connell, partner at King & Spalding — also featured Maxwell Wu, co-founder and CEO of Fulcrum Lending, and Robert Rothschild, managing director at InterVest Capital Partners. Rothschild said many private credit shops now also have an equity business which has proven to be advantageous in the marketplace because of the increased institutional knowledge about individual assets that require equity positions. “As we’ve grown and evolved into the space, the borrowers, the sponsors and developers have seen that the lenders are much more agile,” Rothschild said. “[Private credit lenders] understand the risks and they understand the real estate a lot more than maybe the bank lender might have five to 10 years ago, and that ultimately is the advantage for the underlying sponsor because they have a lender that really understands to underwrite different hypothetical situations.” The following panel, “Recaps & Filling the Capital Stack,” addressed how private credit has played a pivotal role in helping more deals pencil in an elevated interest rate environment with more common and preferred equity products. “The solutions that you see supporting the capital are pretty wide ranging and the depth of market is pretty strong because of the perceived relative value there,” said Brad Bitting, managing director at Post Brothers, speaking on sponsors’ preference for private credit. Ethan Elser, executive vice president of PACE Equity, said commercial property accessed clean energy (C-PACE) loans can also be an effective tool to reduce the cost of capital in an expensive debt deal. He noted that C-PACE is also for recaps often used in mid-construction, or up to three years post construction, that can help sponsors achieve more favorable terms with the senior lender if they need more time to achieve their business plan. Elser added that C-PACE continues to grow as a lending tool with originations on pace for $3.5 billion to $4 billion this year up from $2.5 billion in 2024. The panel — moderated by Mark Fawer, partner at Greenspoon Marder — also consisted of Morris Betesh, founder and managing partner at Arrow Real Estate Advisors, and Daniella Marca, executive director, real estate debt, at BlackRock. Betesh said the CRE debt markets are “very healthy” now, with insurance companies aggressively bidding for deals and banks also back lending on all CRE asset classes. He said regional banks including Flagstar Bank (formerly New York Community Bank) have returned to the CRE debt market and cleaned out their portfolios after getting saddled with some troubled New York City loans when interest rates soared in 2022. The day’s penultimate panel, “Old vs. New: Showcasing the Most Coveted Lending Opportunities,” stressed that the office market has made a comeback in certain markets. Keith Kurland, senior managing director and co-head of New York City capital markets at Walker & Dunlop, said the brokerage has arranged billions of loans for Manhattan office assets this year with banks showing particular interest in lending on the asset class from their balance sheets. Kurland said the bank appetite for New York City office hasn’t existed since pre-COVID. Zachary Cohn, managing partner at Brookfield, said with interest rates 150 basis points lower than a year ago, 2026 is shaping up to see a bounce back in the acquisitions market. He also stressed that the CRE industry is well positioned for a transition of CRE assets from banks to private credit since lenders are not overleveraged to levels they were during the Global Financial Crisis of 2008. “The capital space is stable,” Cohn said. “It’s a long-term theme that will drive our markets in a really impactful way.” The last panel — moderated by Joseph Lanzkron, partner at Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton — also featured Dan Cooperman, head of investments at Mavik Capital Management; Jacob Weinstein, executive vice president, head of real estate and health care at BHI; and Annemarie DiCola, CEO at Trepp. DiCola said CMBS volume is on pace for a banner 2026, likely to reach $120 billion by year’s end, which would be the highest total since 2007. She noted that 75 percent of the CMBS volume has single-asset, single-borrower deals with most of the transactions for Class A office properties.

Title: BlackRock XRP ETF Speculation Hit New Highs As XRPC Performance Shocks Markets

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. The speculation surrounding a potential BlackRock XRP ETF has surged to new heights. This surge is a direct consequence of the astonishing market debut of the Canary XRPC ETF. Canary XRP ETF’s launch has painted a clear picture of robust institutional and retail demand for a regulated XRP investment product. As the speculation around a potential BlackRock XRP ETF is heating up again, the Canary XRPC ETF has delivered one of the strongest launches of the year. An analyst known as Skipper_xrp has noted on X that the newly listed fund stunned the market with over $58 million in first-day trading volume and $245 million in net inflows, outperforming hundreds of ETF debuts of 2025. Skipper_xrp mentioned that many supporters in the XRP community still believe that BlackRock might already be quietly experimenting with or even testing the idea of an XRP trust behind closed doors. The momentum has increased further after Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse made a statement at the company’s Swell event, highlighting that Ripple’s ongoing collaboration with major traditional financial firms will bring digital asset adoption into regulated global markets. However, with the ETF inflows accelerating and XRP gaining more visibility among institutions, many investors are now arguing that it’s only a matter of time before a heavyweight firm like BlackRock will consider stepping into the XRP space. Crypto trader Adam_Xrp has also offered some insight on why XRP didn’t moon when the first ETF was launched. According to the expert, the XRP ETF launch was never going to be a flip-the-switch moment. Even with the first XRP ETF going live, price action was building slowly, and the institutional money did not pour in all at once. Rather, it scales over time as confidence and liquidity grow. Furthermore, the altcoin is still early in the rollout, and more XRP ETFs are scheduled to begin trading. Each new product will increase exposure, volume, and demand. This is how true institutional adoption is slowly progressing. BlackRock has stated that the company is not launching an XRP ETF right now, but this isn’t something they would ignore forever. However, once the regulatory path is fully cleared and institutional demand strengthens, it’s only a matter of time before the biggest players, like BlackRock, will step into the arena. Adam_Xrp concluded that the altcoin wasn’t supposed to skyrocket overnight. This phase is a gradual process of foundation building as the ecosystem, liquidity expansion, and the institutional framework grow. The expert added that if you expect to get rich overnight, without understanding the long-term game plan, then XRP might not be the right investment for you.

I grew up with my three siblings who have always been my idols and mentors, helping me to grow and understand the way of life. My name is Godspower Owie, and I was born and brought up in Edo State, Nigeria. I grew up with my three siblings who have always been my idols and mentors, helping me to grow and understand the way of life. My parents are literally the backbone of my story. They’ve always supported me in good and bad times and never for once left my side whenever I feel lost in this world. Honestly, having such amazing parents makes you feel safe and secure, and I won’t trade them for anything else in this world. I was exposed to the cryptocurrency world 3 years ago and got so interested in knowing so much about it. It all started when a friend of mine invested in a crypto asset, which he yielded massive gains from his investments. When I confronted him about cryptocurrency he explained his journey so far in the field. It was impressive getting to know about his consistency and dedication in the space despite the risks involved, and these are the major reasons why I got so interested in cryptocurrency. Trust me, I’ve had my share of experience with the ups and downs in the market but I never for once lost the passion to grow in the field. This is because I believe growth leads to excellence and that’s my goal in the field. And today, I am an employee of Bitcoinnist and NewsBTC news outlets. My Bosses and co-workers are the best kinds of people I have ever worked with, in and outside the crypto landscape. I intend to give my all working alongside my amazing colleagues for the growth of these companies. Sometimes I like to picture myself as an explorer, this is because I like visiting new places, I like learning new things (useful things to be precise), I like meeting new people - people who make an impact in my life no matter how little it is. One of the things I love and enjoy doing the most is football. It will remain my favorite outdoor activity, probably because I'm so good at it. I am also very good at singing, dancing, acting, fashion and others. I cherish my time, work, family, and loved ones. I mean, those are probably the most important things in anyone's life. I don't chase illusions, I chase dreams. I know there is still a lot about myself that I need to figure out as I strive to become successful in life. I’m certain I will get there because I know I am not a quitter, and I will give my all till the very end to see myself at the top. I aspire to be a boss someday, having people work under me just as I’ve worked under great people. This is one of my biggest dreams professionally, and one I do not take lightly. Everyone knows the road ahead is not as easy as it looks, but with God Almighty, my family, and shared passion friends, there is no stopping me.

Title: Ripple Exec Addresses Tax Issue On XRP Ledger, Where Does It Go?

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. A debate over the XRP Ledger’s (XRPL) economy model has ignited after Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO), David Schwartz, directly addressed questions about taxation on the blockchain. Critics have suggested that if XRP holders do not earn from the ecosystem, someone must be collecting a tax. Schwartz’s response challenges this assumption, framing the XRP Ledger as a public utility rather than a profit-generating mechanism for token holders. The debate has since sparked broader conversations about real-world use cases, passive income expectations, and the underlying purpose of the XRPL blockchain. In a post on X social media, Schwartz clarified that the XRP Ledger does not impose a tax on its users. He explained that the ledger allows holders to issue assets, trade, create NFTs, and make payments without central authority extracting value from these financial activities. He also stated that transaction fees and reserves exist solely as anti-spam measures, not as a mechanism for wealth extraction. The Ripple CTO emphasized that ownership of XRP does not give anyone the right to collect fees or profits from the ledger itself. He drew a comparison to Bitcoin’s blockchain, highlighting that the XRPL provides similar decentralized functionality while also supporting features such as Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs), stablecoins, and NFTs. These features work without XRP holders needing to profit from the system’s operations. Schwartz’s remarks on taxes on the XRPL blockchain come after Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck, raised questions about who benefits if XRP holders do not earn anything from the ecosystem and the protocol itself does not generate value. In response, other members of the community, including XRPL dUNL validator Vet, emphasized that the absence of a tax encourages developers and users to focus on building meaningful, functional use cases rather than relying on passive income. The XRPL tax debate between Schwartz and Sigel also intersected with discussions about the blockchain’s real-world applications. In a much earlier post, Sigel questioned the blockchain’s relevance, subtly hinting that its supporters overstate its functionality. In response, an XRP community member pointed to the recent collaboration between Ondo Finance, Ripple, and BlackRock, in which the XRP Ledger will be utilized for stablecoin issuance, minting, Treasury asset redemption, and liquidity enhancement in financial markets. While Sigel acknowledged the innovative initiative, he reiterated that these applications do not directly generate revenue for XRP token holders, highlighting a gap between network activity and personal gain. Schwartz responded by explaining that the value of XRPL stems from enabling financial independence and reducing reliance on intermediaries, rather than providing passive income. He added that focusing on tax collection as a measure of success can overshadow the blockchain’s purpose of promoting open access and meaningful innovation.

Michael Saylor has kept his word, making yet another massive Bitcoin BTC $92 243 24h volatility: 0.6% Market cap: $1.84 T Vol. 24h: $103.66 B purchase of 8,178 BTC, adding it to the Strategy (NASDAQ: MSTR) portfolio. His purchase comes despite sharp volatility in BTC, which is currently trading around $93,500. The MSTR stock price has meanwhile slipped, falling 2.28 percent in Monday’s pre-market trading. Strategy executive chairman Michael Saylor announced that the company has purchased an additional 8,178 BTC for roughly $835.6 million. This latest acquisition came at an average price of about $102,171 per Bitcoin. Strategy has acquired 8,178 BTC for ~$835.6 million at ~$102,171 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 27.8% YTD 2025. As of 11/16/2025, we hodl 649,870 $BTC acquired for ~$48.37 billion at ~$74,433 per bitcoin. $MSTR $STRC $STRD $STRE $STRF $STRK https://t.co/HI1TeYOvQ9 — Michael Saylor (@saylor) November 17, 2025 The firm’s Bitcoin strategy has generated a year-to-date yield of 27.8% in 2025, as per the filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As of November 16, 2025, Strategy holds 649,870 BTC in its corporate treasury, accumulated at a total cost of roughly $48.37 billion, or an average of $74,433 per BTC. This puts to rest the rumors that Michael Saylor’s Strategy has been selling BTC during the recent price correction. Saylor rejected the claims and said they are firmly “HODLing with diamond hands.” Despite this, MSTR stock price has failed to see the upside, and has slipped further under $200. On Monday’s pre-market trading session, MSTR stock is down by another 2.28% and is currently trading at $195 levels. Popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted that the MSTR stock could further drop to $120 levels if bulls fail with a strong recovery. If this fractal continues to play out, Strategy $MSTR could soon rebound to $260 before rolling over toward $120. https://t.co/hwQ5zMu9BM pic.twitter.com/Vg4ZaPGHHP — Ali (@ali_charts) November 14, 2025 On the other hand, Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff called Strategy’s business model as fraud. MSTR’s entire business model is a fraud. Saylor and I will both be speaking at Binance Blockchain Week in Dubai in early December. I challenge @saylor to debate this proposition with me. Regardless of what happens to Bitcoin, I believe $MSTR will eventually go bankrupt. Let’s go! — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) November 16, 2025 Bitcoin price is showing extreme fragility, extending losses to over 10% during the past week, and currently flirting with $93,500. Crypto analyst Ted Pillows said Bitcoin remains in a Wyckoff distribution phase, signaling continued corrective pressure in the market. According to Pillows, the $88,000-$90,000 range represents a notable support zone that could serve as a potential local bottom if selling eases. $BTC Wyckoff distribution is still happening. There's some support around the $88K-$90K zone, which could act like a local bottom. What's your prediction for BTC bottom this time? pic.twitter.com/24ylurknBr — Ted (@TedPillows) November 17, 2025 While Michael Saylor’s Strategy remains firm on its Bitcoin purchase, big asset managers like BlackRock are selling big. BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) continues to bleed with another $450 million worth of sell-off recently.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs’ 100% Rally Raises More Questions Than Answers | US Crypto News

Written & Edited byLockridge Okoth Welcome to the US Crypto News Morning Briefing—your essential rundown of the most important developments in crypto for the day ahead. Grab a coffee and settle in—this one might make you rethink what you thought you knew about crypto. In the past year, Bitcoin has surged dramatically, posting returns that rival traditional safe-haven assets. Yet, while some see a story of stability, others see lingering questions about risk, reward, and where cryptocurrencies really belong in a portfolio. Since January 2024, Bitcoin ETFs have surged roughly 100%, mirroring the returns of physical gold ETFs, while the S&P 500 returned just 45%. This performance has sparked a fresh debate over Bitcoin’s role in investor portfolios: is it a “risk-on” asset like stocks, or a “store of value” like gold? Since spot btc ETFs launched in Jan 2024, they’ve returned same % as physical gold ETFs…Approx 100%.S&P 500 has returned nearly 45%.So is btc a “risk on” asset like stocks or “store of value” like gold? Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store, highlighted the surprising parity, with the striking similarity to gold returns prompting investors to reassess Bitcoin’s traditional narrative. While Bitcoin is widely viewed as a volatile, high-risk asset, its ETF performance over the past year has aligned with one of the most stable investment vehicles in history. Against this backdrop, investors weigh whether the risk is worth the return. “I think the question for cripto is… especially ETH. Do you want to hold a high-volatility asset for that kind of return? ETH flat or down for the past 4/5 years,” one user chimed. This remark highlights the challenge for investors, who see Bitcoin’s rally offering gold-like gains, but but the risks due to volatility remain a persistent threat for crypto as an asset class. Risk-adjusted returns remain a key factor when evaluating crypto’s place in a diversified portfolio. Risks notwithstanding, BlackRock’s recent People & Money report reveals the growing retail appetite for ETFs, especially among younger investors. According to Nate Geraci’s summary: This data highlights a generational shift in investing behavior. Younger investors are increasingly incorporating crypto into their portfolios alongside traditional assets. This shows that the market is growing faster than conventional wisdom suggests. Institutional activity adds another layer to the debate. Whale tracker reports indicate that BlackRock recently deposited 4,880 BTC, worth approximately $467 million, and 54,730 ETH valued at nearly $176 million into the Coinbase exchange. BlackRock deposits 4,880 $BTC, worth $467.19 million, and 54,730 $ETH, worth $175.93 million into Coinbase – Arkham. pic.twitter.com/Q7RSl6c6k3 The transaction marks the second move this month. Barely two weeks ago, the asset manager transferred 2,042 BTC, worth $213 million, and 22,681 ETH, valued at $80 million, to the same exchange. Moving tokens to exchanges often suggest possible plans to sell, a move that could be bearish for Bitcoin and Ethereum prices. “Last time they did this, the market dipped soon after. Now with Bitcoin sitting near $104K… is sub-$100K next?” Kyle Doops posed on X after the initial transaction. Nonetheless, large transfers from major fund managers to exchanges could also mean strategic rebalancing. With both possibilities likely to weigh on near-term price sentiment, it is worth noting that concentrated institutional holdings could amplify market swings, particularly in high-volatility environments. Should Bitcoin be treated like digital gold, offering portfolio stability? Or is it a high-risk, high-reward asset akin to equities? Looking ahead, retail and institutional flows, ETF innovation, and macroeconomic conditions will likely define crypto’s trajectory in 2026. As younger investors increasingly allocate to crypto ETFs, the market may see both rapid growth and heightened volatility, reinforcing the need for careful portfolio strategy.

Title: Stocks Go 24-7 in New Crypto Betting Markets With 100x Leverage
URL: https://www.ndtvprofit.com/crypto/stocks-go-24-7-in-new-crypto-betting-markets-with-100x-leverage
Time Published: 2025-11-17T14:08:06Z
Full Content:
A product born in crypto’s most fevered era is being quietly rebuilt for the US stock market — trading 24-7, with no brokers and no closing bell. The perpetual swap, or perp, is a derivative that lets traders take long or short positions on a digital asset’s price, without ever owning it. In crypto, perps have reshaped trading, becoming a multi-trillion-dollar engine of leverage and liquidity, where positions can run as high as 100-to-1 and never expire. Now developers are extending that model to traditional assets and benchmarks, including Nasdaq 100, Tesla Inc., and Coinbase Global Inc., and more. Think of it as fantasy sports for equities: traders bet on where a stock or index will go, using crypto as collateral — bypassing Wall Street’s investment ecosystem altogether. The offerings, which are gaining momentum despite past blowups and regulatory strain, are technically off-limits to US users because no domestic framework currently permits them. On the Hyperliquid blockchain — known for its fast-growing namesake exchange — a Nasdaq-linked contract known as XYZ100 has already drawn as much as more than $60 million in open interest. Wall Street is already paying attention. The likes of Jane Street are backing Vest Labs, which is building a venue for global equity perp trading. Crypto exchanges “are realizing that equities are much better tradable asset at least in the current economy,” said Justin Ma, CEO of Vest Labs. “I really want this to be a venue for 24-7 price discovery for US companies as well as something that’s fully accessible for investors all around the world.” The experiment captures two defining forces in today’s markets: unstoppable retail speculation, and crypto’s drive to rebuild finance in its own image. While big institutions cautiously pilot the likes of tokenized Treasuries, digital-asset developers are reviving the experiments that defined the industry’s early boom — from perpetual swaps to prediction markets — with bets that are fast-moving, lightly regulated, and wired for volatility. Here’s how it works: A trader posts crypto collateral — typically the USDC stablecoin — and opens a long or short position on, say, the Nasdaq 100. They’re not buying actual shares; they’re entering a smart contract that tracks the index’s price using external data feeds. If the trade goes their way, they earn the difference. If it moves against them, their position is typically auto-liquidated once their margin runs out. A dynamic fee — the funding rate — balances demand between longs and shorts, so the price of the perp stays tethered to the real-world asset. Platforms can lean on price oracles and market makers to model stock moves when markets close – a fragile but functional, for now, setup. “Perps were uniquely suited for nascent, speculative crypto markets as the structure allowed for outsized leverage with an objective, fair and self‑regulating funding mechanism in continuous 24-7 markets,” said Darius Sit, founder of crypto investment firm QCP. It echoes a broader race toward 24-7 markets. Traditional markets are inching that way. Cboe has proposed longer option sessions, and brokerages already offer extended access on alternative venues. The crypto version goes further: nonstop stock bets without Wall Street’s machinery. Whether these contracts truly track the stocks is debatable. Whether they grant rights — dividends, votes, ownership — is not. They don’t. Risky Business When markets close, the funding rate becomes the pulse: bullish weekends push it positive and prices drift up; fear flips it. It works, mostly, while markets are open. After-hours is murkier. Ostium, one of the perps platforms for equity and other assets, pauses trading when stocks stop; Others, such as the ones on Hyperliquid, don’t. They model underlying equity prices while exchanges sleep, keeping liquidity alive but risking distortion. “This structure enables perpetual-futures protocols to serve as natural venues for price discovery when primary markets are offline,” said Wyatt Raich, a former BlackRock executive, who is starting a new equity derivatives platform. Kaledora Fontana Kiernan-Linn, co-founder of Ostium, said letting markets run while stocks are closed creates risks that outweigh the benefits, citing examples like sudden tariff announcements or surprise earnings-related announcements. “You can get wicked out on the weekend of someone’s moves of a massive order,” she said. “You might suddenly have all of your position being completely eroded by funding, like unpredictable things can happen when no one else can hedge.” For many traders, though, that volatility is the point. US rules cap equity margin at roughly three-times leverage. Perps offer 10X, 50X, even 100X, with commensurate risk. “One of the biggest trends in retail financial products in the US is the rise of demand for leverage,” said Tom Schmidt, general partner at venture capital firm Dragonfly. “The DTCC effectively limits leverage on US equities through traditional margin lending to 3X, but there’s clearly demand for more than that.” There’s just one problem: they’re not legal in the US. Perps sit in a legal no‑man’s‑land. They behave like futures, mimic securities, and run on crypto infrastructure. Michael Marcantonio, head of decentralized finance at Galaxy Digital, calls it “the holy trinity of regulation.” Such contracts, he noted, would be overseen by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Derivatives Clearing Organizations. And under current US law, approved futures must have a defined expiration date. That’s why these products still block US users — though most run directly on blockchains, meaning anyone determined enough can still find a way in. Precedent is discouraging. In 2021, the SEC subpoenaed Terra’s Do Kwon over Mirror Protocol’s synthetic stocks. Still, there are signs of openness. In September this year, the SEC and CFTC proposed a joint pilot for novel market structures. And under the crypto-friendly Trump administration, hopes have risen that US access to these products may follow. Coinbase has already introduced regulated Bitcoin and Ether perps for US traders. “The SEC continues to be deliberate in their efforts to find a path to the US market for innovative products,” said Ryne Miller, a partner at Lowenstein Sandler and former general counsel at FTX US, who adds that incoming CFTC chair Michael Selig may also look for ways in.

Title: Exclusive: Popular crypto lending service Aave to launch app in Apple store that offers high-yield returns to consumers

The recent crypto boom has been marked by blockchain companies working to expand their appeal to mainstream consumers. That now includes Aave Labs, the developer behind a popular decentralized lending service, which on Monday announced plans to launch an app in Apple’s App Store and opened up a waitlist for interested users. Aave is well-known in crypto as a leading project in DeFi, or decentralized finance. By opening up the waitlist for the app, it seeks to offer a version of its services without the litany of lingo, such as “stablecoins” and “protocol,” that is common in crypto but that may be unfamiliar or offputting to outsiders. Aave’s new product acts like a savings account—but with a higher yield. Users can earn a minimum 5% in interest on their holdings and can deposit money in with a bank account or debit card. The product uses stablecoins, or cryptocurrencies pegged to underlying assets like the U.S. dollar, as well as the Aave protocol. Aave has been one of the longest-standing networks of its kind, boasting over $30 billion in deposits, according to data from the crypto analytics site DefiLlama. Customers typically can get more interest on their assets on DeFi protocols than through conventional banks, but they often come with a greater risk of hacks—and no government backing. Still, Stani Kulechov, founder and CEO of Aave Labs, stressed that the Aave protocol—and therefore the forthcoming Aave app—is safe, especially since Aave has never experienced an exploit in its five-year history. “There is a security on the actual market economics. And then there’s also security on the actual code basis,” he said, pointing to how multiple companies have audited the software. The planned launch of the Aave app comes as the chasm between traditional finance companies and crypto-native startups is growing smaller. The marquee asset manager BlackRock has leaned into Bitcoin, the fintech Stripe has embraced stablecoins, and the banking giant JPMorgan Chase has steadily deployed new blockchain products. Meanwhile, crypto companies have sought to attract more mainstream users. The U.S. crypto exchange Kraken has launched its own payments app and a slew of others are aiming to create their own bank-like products built with stablecoins, or cryptocurrencies pegged to underlying assets like the U.S. dollar. “Typically, DeFi has been accessible to very savvy, professional users,” Kulechov, CEO of Aave Labs, told Fortune. “The next step for DeFi is to bring more direct access for consumers.” Kulechov is one of DeFi’s torchbearers. In 2020, he launched the Aave protocol. Since then, he’s expanded out his DeFi offerings to include a crypto wallet, a decentralized stablecoin, and a decentralized protocol for social media. In October, Aave Labs acquired the stablecoin company Stable Finance for an undisclosed sum. “They had more of a consumer DeFi experience that helped our team to move faster and and improve our offering down the line,” said Kulechov.

Quick Facts: Let’s be honest, the final quarter of 2025 has felt pretty brutal. At some point, we’ve seen Bitcoin ($BTC) prices crash by over 24% in just a few weeks (from around $125K to around $95K), throwing the whole market into a deep state of ‘Extreme Fear.’ While some people are pointing out this is the ‘worst Q4 since 2019,’ it still doesn’t mean you should be losing sleep. Let’s break down exactly why not so you can sleep a little easier. This massive drop isn’t a structural collapse; it’s a giant, necessary flush-out. Some analysts are calling it a ‘massive liquidation’ or a ‘mid-cycle reset.’ Basically, the market got over-leveraged with speculators using borrowed money, and this crash was the system hitting the reset button to clean out all that shaky speculation. Look beneath the hood, and the long-term outlook is stronger than ever. First, institutional money isn’t leaving. Commitment from the big guns is unshakable. US spot Bitcoin ETFs have attracted around $58.85B in cumulative net inflows. We’ve seen BlackRock and Fidelity logging huge buy-ins while the price was falling. This is smart money quietly accumulating from scared retail sellers. Secondly, insane price targets still stand as major financial players aren’t backing off their bullish calls. Institutions like Bitwise and VanEck are still holding firm to aggressive crypto projections, expecting Bitcoin to climb into the $180,000 to $200,000 range next year. So, while the charts look scary right now, the consensus among investors is that this ‘Extreme Fear’ is actually laying the most solid foundation yet for a record-breaking 2026. If this pans out, then it begs the question, which are the best crypto to buy before the next bull run? Our top picks, PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), and Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU) all offer something different that could pique interest and see potential big returns.

Title: Yet More AI Bubble Worries, Now on Debt Side, with Wall Street Journal Featuring AI Datacenter Borrowing “Frenzy”
URL: https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2025/11/yet-more-ai-bubble-worries-now-on-debt-side-with-wall-street-journal-featuring-ai-datacenter-borrowing-frenzy.html
Time Published: 2025-11-17T11:30:37Z
Full Content:
Yours truly is overdue on an overview how private-debt-backed AI datacenter deals work and why companies like Meta who are perfectly capable of borrowing in their own name paying 200-300 basis points extra not to do so is not a good sign. But the Wall Street Journal just published a very detailed story on the general outlines of this debt binge, which has gotten more attention in the popular press as borrowing levels have skyrocketed this year: Big Tech borrowing for AI data centers: 2015-2024 average: $32B/year Sept-Oct 2025 alone: $75B > Meta borrowed $30B > Oracle borrowed$18B > $META also did $27B off-balance sheet with Blue Owl AI companies now 14% of IG index The “money-printing” tech companies are…… pic.twitter.com/IuhBU0LS4M — junkbondinvestor (@junkbondinvest) November 5, 2025 And from the new Wall Street Journal story: What the Journal calls a “frenzy” in Wall Street Blows Past Bubble Worries to Supercharge AI Spending Frenzy is awfully reminiscent of the toxic phase of the subprime lending binge, when originators were so desperate for product, as the jibe then went, they’d fund borrower who could fog a mirror. It was years later that we were able, with the key elements including some insiders plus a remarkable pre-crisis analysis by (of all things) an equity market analyst, Henry Maxey of Ruffler Investment, to piece together how leverage-on-leverage created an even-then, well-reported “wall of liquidity”. It was also the leverage on leverage (and that systemically important yet fragile financial institutions were heavily exposed) that made the bubble unwind so catastrophic. We have warned that the unwind of an, erm, traditional credit bubble, even if very large (see Japan and for a lesser but still nasty version, the S&L crisis) typically produces at worst very deep and protracted recessions and zombification (the runup to the 1929 US crash also featured CDO-like leverage on leverage, see Frank Partnoy’s The Match King for details), as opposed to banking system near-or-actual failures. So again, we have yet to see evidence of that meteor-hitting-the-financial-system event being in the offing. But absence of evidence does not amount to evidence of absence. And perhaps finance historians can correct me, but I do not recall a historical instance of a massive equity bubble (without 1929-style heavy borrowings directly against those equities) accompanied by so many red flags, particularly operating and financial leverage, in the underlying commercial activity. That included recursive deals among key companies and as we’ll discuss a bit in this and more in posts to come, overly-clever borrowing structures that make sense only to achieve higher levels of leverage than could be achieved by traditional means. The Journal points out in passing that one of the mega-deals will pay more than 2% that a plainer-vanilla offering would. In a fine overview of in June on how these financings work, Paul Kedrosky similarly said the premium was 200 to 300 basis points. That’s an awful lot to pay for opacity and supposed balance sheet remoteness.1 As a brief introduction to causes for concern about the datacenter boom, see the executive summary from Bubble or Nothing from the Center for Public Enterprise (hat tip Matt Stoller): ● Cash flow uncertainty persists as the cost of providing AI inference services continues to rise. Leading AI inference service providers are not particularly differentiated from one another; this competitive market structure suppresses market participants’ pricing power and prevents them from recovering rising costs. ● The collateral value of a graphical processing unit (GPU), the sector’s keystone asset, looks poised to fall in the near-term. The value of chips fluctuates depending on uncertain user demand as well as the supply dynamics and technical specifications of new GPUs, now released yearly. The cash flow that GPU collateral can demand is suppressed due to the sector’s competitive market structure and the uncertain depreciation schedule of existing GPUs. ● Data center tenants will undertake multiple cycles of intense and increasingly expensive capital expenditure within a single lease term, posing considerable tenant churn risks to data center developers. This asset-liability mismatch between data center developers and their tenants will strain developers’ creditworthiness without guarantees from market-leading tech companies. ● Circular financing, or “roundabouting,” among so-called hyperscaler tenants—the leading tech companies and AI service providers—create an interlocking liability structure across the sector. These tenants comprise an incredibly large share of the market and are financing each others’ expansion, creating concentration risks for lenders and shareholders. ● Debt is playing an increasingly large role in the financing of data centers. While debt is a quotidian aspect of project finance, and while it seems like hyperscaler tech companies can self-finance their growth through equity and cash, the lack of transparency in some recent debt-financed transactions and the interlocked liability structure of the sector are cause for concern. The first two points alone, the fact that inference costs are not only not falling but still rising, and near-term downside in GPU prices ought to be fatal, or at least detrimental to debt funding. Yet as you’ll see, even though the Journal raises concerns, and even adds to this list by describing how AI “hyperscalers” are putting out duplicate orders for the datacenter capacity, virtually assuring whipsaw, it’s not as sobering as the list above. But it includes signs that some dogs are turning their noses up at the dogfood: Stock prices normally go up when a company reports record revenue but after Meta did just that on Oct. 29, its shares plummeted 11% instead. The reason: Zuckerberg disclosed he will “aggressively” increase capital spending on AI, drawing questions from analysts about how the company plans to actually make money off the new technology. What the Journal describes parallels the late-stage subprime lending frenzy. In 2007, CEO Chuck Prince of later-big-bailout recipient Citigroup famously remarked: When the music stops, in terms of liquidity, things will be complicated. “But as long as the music is playing, you’ve got to get up and dance. We’re still dancing….The depth of the pools of liquidity is so much larger than it used to be that a disruptive event now needs to be much more disruptive than it used to be. Consider from the Journal the, erm, enthusiasm of lenders and fears of becoming wall flowers in this party: Silicon Valley’s biggest players are flush with cash and were able to fund much of the initial AI build-out from their own coffers. As the dollar figures climb ever higher, they are turning to debt and private equity—spreading the risks and potential rewards more broadly across the economy. Some of the financing is coming from plain-vanilla corporate bond sales, but financiers are making far bigger fees off giant private deals. Virtually every Wall Street player is angling to get a piece of the action, from banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley to traditional asset managers such as BlackRock. Investor appetite for data-center debt is so strong that some money managers have booked billion-dollar gains in a matter of days, even before construction of the facilities they are financing is complete. Still, the longer-term performance is hardly assured. Big tech companies are expected to spend nearly $3 trillion on AI through 2028 but only generate enough cash to cover half that tab, according to analysts at Morgan Stanley. Big names in the financial world, such as Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, are warning about AI-fueled froth in the markets and in capital spending. At the same time, the fear of missing out is real. Days after Solomon voiced his concerns to analysts, Goldman formed a new team in its banking and markets group focused on AI infrastructure financing. Later from the Journal: Funds that invest in AI deals say they carry little risk, because tech companies with deep pockets have ironclad leases that will generate the money to pay investors back. Microsoft has a higher credit rating than the U.S. government, and it told investors on Oct. 29 that it would double its total data-center footprint in the next two years. Perhaps I am too old, but I recall that IBM and GE were once AAA rated too, and that by 2000 (for IBM) and 2010 (for GE) their luster had taken quite a turn. And remember the pre-crisis pattern that housing prices had never fallen nationwide, only regionally? These supposedly blue-chip tech companies are placing monster bets on AI, so their historical solidity isn’t as germane as it might seem, unless they back off if the fundamental performance of large language models continues to fall well short of promises. The reaction of the Meta stockholders to Zuckerberg’s promise of even more big AI spending is confirmation. Back to the Journal: Tech executives see more risk in underbuilding than overbuilding… But some tech companies are weaker financially than others. Oracle…needs to borrow billions more for its spending spree, prompting Moody’s Ratings and S&P Global Ratings to edge closer to reclassifying Oracle’s bonds as junk debt. In recent weeks, the company’s stock price has fallen 32% and its bonds have lost about 7%. There’s also the risk that the chips tech firms are borrowing to buy could be obsolete in a few year… The last time Wall Street went all-in on an industry was the fracking boom—then bust—over a decade ago. This time, financiers are marshaling even larger sums. The article continues with a breathless account of the boomtown effect that these datacenter buildouts are generating. Matt Stoller flagged the concern of growing real-economy dependence on massive spend in what ought to be a niche: A few months ago, I asked why our economy, despite steady growth in official numbers, feels so creepy and unstable. My conclusion was that the U.S. is in a “Chinese finger trap” economy. We are dependent for growth on monopolies and an AI bubble, which juices the all-important stock market. Trying to grow an economy in a more stable way could lower stock prices which would paradoxically lead to a downturn. So we’re stuck, until some outside event occurs…. Data center developers are now approaching multiple utilities with proposals for the same project, leading to “phantom” forecasts of demand that isn’t actually there. Essentially, it’s hoarding. Hoarding is what happen in overheated markets….But this can lead to something called the “bullwhip effect.” Buyers overstate how much they want to buy….all of a sudden the demand evaporates because it was never real in the first place. This dynamic can throw an economy into an overheated state, and then a depression; that’s what happened globally after World War I, leading to, among other things, Mussolini’s takeover of Italy…. At this point, data centers are pretty much what’s growing in America. I recently had a conversation with an elected official who told me that data center construction is a huge construction jobs boost in rust belt areas….He posited a tension between political support for the new temporary jobs and political anger over higher electricity prices. We have a one-legged economy, with the AI build-out serving as a driver of real estate values, the stock market, and GDP growth This is a bet-the-economy scheme on models where China has much better mousetraps. There is no way this will end well. ____ 1 The crisis demonstrated that theory and practice can be two different things. Banks had long offloaded credit card receivables to investors in supposedly off-balance sheet deals. When losses on them rose to previously unthinkable levels, the investors successfully revolted and made the banks eat some of those costs. The reason was the bank credit card businesses depended on being able to keep using other people’s credit. I am not sure whether or not these AI datacenter borrowers won’t wind up in an analogous position, of being so dependent on ongoing lending that lenders won’t let them walk away from outsized credit losses. “companies like Meta who are perfectly capable of borrowing in their own name paying 200-300% basis points extra” Yves, I noticed something that should be fixed: “% basis points”. Incompatible units, right? Aargh, fixing, thanks. “…have ironclad leases that will generate the money to pay investors back.” Bwaahhh!!! That is until those leases hit the smelters of the bankruptcy courts! Ed Dowd on the US economic, the AI bubble, the stock market, and the housing market. utube, ~1 hr. Ed Dowd: We’re Already in a Recession, Oil Going to $30 & The Deflation Scare Coming https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHM-BH-SguE Excellent discussion and economic assessments by Dowd. These are Capitalists to the core. Meta and much of big tech still have corporate stock buyback plans open. Incentives drive outcomes—-companies have move incentive to lever-up and chase the AI headlines than being seen as a 1989-era IBM (a company missing a secular pivot). “…China has much better mousetraps.” Listened recently to an interview with Andrew Ross Sorkin on this topic taking much the same line as the above article, during which he claimed as an example of China’s technical and manufacturing prowess that BYD electric vehicles are the gold standard that are better and cheaper than U.S. cars and that if the U.S. didn’t have tariffs on Chinese cars we would probably not have and an auto industry in the U.S. I’m giving serious consideration to encouraging my USian grandchildren to learn Mandarin, https://www.newyorker.com/video/watch/the-radio-hour-andrew-ross-sorkin-in-conversation-with-andrew-ross-sorkin (Minute 12:33) When you’ve lost Andrew Ross Sorkin… I saw a video on the YouTube’s last night so it must be true… BYD just test drove, (introduced?) an EV that will reach speeds over 200 miles an hour. I think they were at 300+ mph Believe it o not, an electric motor can generate enormous rotational torque. Combustion engines are no match. Getting to 200-300 mph is more a matter of stability and aerodynamics. Too many EV’s on a US freeway will create the same congestion as an ICE vehicle. I’ve driven and owned a number of ICE muscle cars, mostly during my misspent youth, that I found impressively fast off the line. Now I drive a little Toyota hybrid, which frankly feels a bit like riding around in a sardine can, that upon acceleration can give you whiplash. I exaggerate but slightly. Believe it or not, torque can not be anything but rotational. :) “Linear torque” is force. Also, torque can be multiplied via gears, while power can’t. Steam engines and electric motors tend to produce maximum torque close to zero rpm, which is the “believe it or not” part for ICE only drivers (with diesel engines being better at low rpm torque than petrol ones). Limited range of rotational speeds with useful torque is why trasmission is a necessity (and also why big trucks have more gears). Getting to 200-300 mph is a matter of many things, but mostly not crashing. :) Son in law just received his Tesla cyber truck. He loves it, so far. We talked about the almost instant high torque etc. Tech features are great! Run everything from the smart phone. My nephew has had the EV Rivian pick-up for a couple of years he still loves it. I saw it Saturday! I hope my daughter stops calling their cyber truck the “dumpster”. At 75 I’ll stay with the ICE-SUV. My one-owner 1977 Chevrolet Cabriolet, with second 305 V8, 270.000 miles, low rev – high torque, runs like new. A random professional-American’s Mandarin will never be good as their random Chinese equivalent’s English. Particularly as English is the de-facto international working language in Asia, which is much more linguistically diverse than Europe’s Proto-Indo-European-descendant languages. Don’t push Mandarin just because of China in a vacuum (though obviously the thought counts). China isn’t just Mandarin, it’s a civilizational tradition that evolved independently of the west’s Greco-Roman-Enlightenment lineage—-an obvious statement, but something that’s lost on lots of credentialed, supposedly educated, people. And today’s “Communist China” is just one page in its lengthy history. “And today’s “Communist China” is just one page in its lengthy history.” Truly. The pages that have for the most part drawn my interest over the years are those having to do with the development of Buddhism in that country. One thing in particular that strikes me is that the Chinese took the more asocial natural mysticism of India and Southeast Asia and made it more fit for purpose in a materially practical, more socially engaged way of living. Yes, I communicate with Chinese entrepreneurs and their English is as good or better than lifelong Americans. I’m told their linguistic skill is not unusual. I just started listening to an audiobook “Empire of AI”. One line of thinking in the book is that “size/scale/compute power” is not the only infrastructure model one can choose from to chase the elusive AGI unicorn (another topic the book explores). This is the predominant line of thinking running thru SV though. Open AI seized the narrative and strategically decided to achieve AGI thru sheer scale and size of its compute resources. 3 hours into the book so far but its very interesting. Thanks for the book tip. I’m currently reading Adam Becker’s More Everything Forever describing beliefs and intentions prevalent among Silicon Valley elites. “Inmates running the asylum” is a phrase that comes to mind. And not in a good way as in King of Hearts. $133B in questionable debt? Just file it under “other.” Here we have JP Morgan blazing the opacity trail. Thanks for this background, Yves. To me, this finance perspective confirms some things I think about AI and data centers. An example from a portion of the Journal article you quote: But some tech companies are weaker financially than others. Oracle…needs to borrow billions more for its spending spree, prompting Moody’s Ratings and S&P Global Ratings to edge closer to reclassifying Oracle’s bonds as junk debt. In recent weeks, the company’s stock price has fallen 32% and its bonds have lost about 7%. Why risk so much? Hasn’t stock price been sacred in the post-Greenspan era? Doesn’t this seem to be about more than even money? I think I’ve found part of the answer in two interviews Ross Douthat, the Roman Catholic New York Times columnist, has done in the past year. The first, Douthat’s interview of Peter Thiel is second perhaps only to Tucker’s sit-down with Nick Fuentes among widely viewed videos. The second one, done in the past few days, is of Paul Kingsnorth, who’s on a book tour promoting his new book, Against the Machine: The Unmaking of Humanity. I was introduced to Kingsnorth through amfortas’s links to the Dark Mountain Project, which was begun by Kingsnorth and Dougald Hine. I recommend listening to the Thiel interview before the Kingsnorth one because Douthat and Kingsnorth discuss that interview at some length. It’s also interesting contrast the two interviewees’ personalities and characters. (Kingsnorth calls the projects of Thiel and Musk “little boys’ toys,” an example of his barely contained contempt for them.) I have watched about 15min of the first interview and paused at about 15 min of the second and, whatever one thinks about Kingsnorth he can be labelled as freethinker while Thiel not. The later is heavily influenced by his attachments (to his companies, money, whatever he is attached to) no matter how much he would like to appear as a freethinker. I couldn’t stomach Thiel for longer while I will probably end Kingsnorth interview even if i do not agree completely with him in some instances but he is much more interesting than Thiel. One shakes the brain and the other shakes the stomach. Let me recommend the latest interview of Emmanuel Todd by Glenn Diesen which I found interesting. This are people who shake one beliefs and that is good. Agree with Ignacio about Diesen’s interview of Todd. For once, Diesen pretty much shut up & let Todd talk. Todds latest book is about the loss of the West. He gets heavily into the loss of the philosophical “center” of the West- sort of there being no there there. He says that Western society has become a “Zombie” society like the Nazis. Well worth the listen! Like this: from 2024, In view of this, ladies and gentlemen, what we can conclude is that the adoration of transvestites is an inevitable consequence of liberalism, and that the Inquisition burned too few people. I will not venture into the twisted nest of vipers that is Thiel’s brain, but Kingsnorth will be worth a listen, thanks. I’m meeting with my Minnesota AI vs. water people tomorrow. It’ll be interesting to hear their perspective. Data centers might try to propose one project to competing power companies but there’s only one water source (and regulator). If the volume of permit amendment applications from water utilitues/cities has fallen (data centers in MN do not supply their own water), the number of data center projects in MN will have fallen proportionally. I’m trying to think about what’s similar and different with dotcom. 1) Similar to AI, dotcom had a huge infra build-out of core network fiber, switching, and data centers. Not all of that was scrap as some of it has relatively long useful life, especially fiber and switching, unlike AI GPUs. 2) The demand for dotcom infra was real, growing, and continues to grow. The dotcom bubble was supply. The Inernet as such was not vaporware. In AI it’s not clear how much money there really is in psychopathic search engines and generation of videos of dogs with 5 legs. A lot of the ultimate “demand” may be hype. 3) As Yves so well presents above, the financials of the AI bubble may involve a lot more leverage than dotcom. So what are we facing? Something worse than dotcom but not worse than GFC? The public Internet in the 90’s was not vaporware. It was the long developing son of the military/university ARPANET (network) from the 70’s. The early Internet was communication over phone lines. As public access grew cable/fiber optics were seen as necessary to get increased public/business participation. Unfortunately, laying cable was faster than public uptake. Until. of course, Netscape, and other graphical user interface that didn’t require knowledge of computer programming. Then, with exploding popularity (ease of use), the Internet demanded cable and fiber connectivity. Something tells me AGI is not going to follow this breakout scenario. Yea GUI, and they said no one would pay those hundreds of dollars for that heavy CRT. On #2. you are GREATLY confusing dotcom infrastructure with companies selling “eyeballs’. Most of the bubble was in the latter. There’s also the risk that the chips tech firms are borrowing to buy could be obsolete in a few year… Leaving aside for the moment the overall ridiculous nature of the AI technology boom and the fact that it is going to come crashing down of its own accord quite soon since LLVMs are not fit for their advertised purpose, any above quote seems like it highlights another risk-within-a-risk. GPUs are a very high technology product that most people don’t know much about beyond a few acronyms. Using them as debt collateral seems very fraught in its own right since no one knows enough about them to decide what they are worth and in particular how quickly they’re going to depreciate. Nvidia recently announced that they are going to a one-year design cycle, meaning all the chips that were purchased in 2025 will be superseded by newer, more powerful chips in 2026, and so on each year. I imagine this will create a big hit to the older models, and I imagine after this happens a few times the older chips will be essentially worthless. I don’t know what the term of the debt is that is being backed by these chips, but if it’s more than a couple of years this is obviously a shipwreck waiting to happen. There are other changes in the technological landscape that can also render existing GPU hardware worthless in one way or another, including changes in software architecture and new manufacturers coming on the scene with cheaper and more powerful products. These kinds of things are both hard to predict and reasonably likely to happen. Some physical objects, like real estate, vehicles, precious gems, and so on seem to make fairly reasonable collateral (even so, look at the record!), but new and evolving integrated circuits of very high density and complexity don’t fit into that category. 1. I am yet to hear of significant proposals stateside to expand electric generation capacity – plus transmission lines – to support all this projected data center growth. And remember, the US is a fragmented electricity space (10 separate market regions in just the lower 48), with differing regulatory rules (Texas does not equal New York does not equal California), so these need to be done at the local level. The Russians have publically talked about using the new modular type nuclear reactors (including the ones they’d developed for the Burevestnik and the Poseidon weapons), though for now data centers do not seem at the top of their energy or nuke priorities (they’re replacing their aging nukes plus upgrading the infrastructure in historically underserved regions like Yakutia). The Chinese are drastically increasing their nuke capacity, paying the Russians a healthy chunk so to do. The Americans……….eh? Or maybe I’ve just missed it. But all these plans for data center buildouts without the generation and transmission to go with are bound to run into quite the obstacle once they start drawing enough power to drop a given market region below its “reserve margin” level (typically 12% over peak demand is how much you want in generation), or, if god forbid these idiots build them in Texas, which is the only fully deregulated market, cause “ice storm” level price spikes for customers. 2. I am not sure what you would use as collateral if you’re doing any secured or ABS type financing for these data centers. The buildings themselves? Because here’s the thing. If the servers are meant to do AI-LLM type stuff, that means every year, when the new chips/GPUs come out, you have to upgrade them all, at huge cost. But meanwhile, standard data center tasks do not need this extra capacity and do not need this extra bang for the buck. So 1-2-3 years into the deal you’re stuck with a bunch of formerly high-end chips that no-one needs, unless you pile even more money into the place? Or think about it this way. Whenever I build my own PC, instead of buying the latest, most high-end CPU and video card, I buy the ones from ~2 years ago. Because at that point the price comes down 50% or more, while the decline in capability – for home user applications – is fairly negligible. The point is, the depreciation on these assets is insane relative to, say, a commercial building, or a power plant, or a refinery or whatever. Or even a commercial aircraft (assumed 25-year useful life, usually). To do an ABS deal secured by chips, if that is, in fact, what they are doing…that is pure insanity. 3. Does anyone remember IBM’s Watson? Their whole thing in the 2000s and early-mid 2010s was – we have this “artificial intelligence” thing called Watson, and we’ll sell it to hospitals and such, where it will make diagnoses and help (read: replace) the medical staff in this and that capacity. And…the whole thing failed, because they could not fix what we now call AI hallucinations. Or, rather, IBM tinkered around with it for a while, with some sample projects in this or that hospital that never went anywhere much, and eventually sold it to some PE guys for ~$1 billion, which is rather less than they’d invested into it in the first place. Of course, the total cost for Watson, at least its medical unit, including all the R&D and whatnot, had to have been in the several billion range at the most, which is something IBM can easily afford. I look at the charts for projected LLM capex spend, and there is just no way to get there from here, unless there is a technological revolution in LLMs no-one knows about. Re #2, the security is the data center lease agreements. I seldom comment on tech since I stopped working in that field 25 years ago, and I deliberately do not use hardware or software services provided by AI, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, etc. Nevertheless, I am typing this on an ancient computer running Linux, which I deliberately configured to run minimal unbloated software, and I realize I need to build a new computer from parts because using my ancient parts is getting too risky. I remember 30 years ago when I eagerly anticipated the weekend edition of the newspaper with the weekend Fry’s Electronics ad. Holy moley! There’s a CPU and ATX motherboard combo for $120. I’m getting it. Without hesitation, I would drive there (or get my dad to drive) and immediately splurge. Then, I got right to work assembling my new computer. Wow, how times have changed for me. I gave you this background to discuss how I have since fallen on hard times, how frugal I am, and how RAM prices have recently soared. Apparently, this happened because of the AI bubble encouraging RAM manufacturers to divert their resources away from desktop computer memory and components on RAM modules to continue feeding the AI bubble. Because I am not too knowledgeable about this, let me link to the Hardware Unboxed videos “DDR5 Pricing Skyrockets, What’s Going On?” and “VRAM Cost Is About To Make GPUs Way More Expensive“. I have been dreaming about buying new parts for a new computer for 6-12 months now. One year ago a 2×16 GB package of DDR5 RAM was approximately $100 USD. Today, that could be well over $200. That difference is enough to discourage me from buying. Three companies dominate the market for memory: Samsung, Micron, and Hynix. The AI bubble seems to have affected all three companies and respective prices for RAM. Of course, I could try to skimp in other areas. I didn’t pay attention to computers for a decade or more. Thus, I got up to speed recently in anticipation of any supposed Black Friday promotions. Apparently, Intel makes garbage chips now. That leaves one other option, AMD. AMD’s latest and greatest platform is named AM5 (with AM6 forthcoming), but I could deliberately buy an AM4 CPU, AM4 motherboard, and DDR4 RAM. DDR4 RAM did not get excluded from whatever frothiness is going on with AI. It’s all kind of spendy. Argh! Risk to the big 7 paying off these debts: Trump fails to prevent China’s DeepSeek from dominating Sam Altman’s too much computer, too much training overhead. Big 7 intro/monopoly power already gone. Data center build outs delayed by grid connection, if the grid can get debt to build out. Project and supply chain delays. Some number of US/EU sources doing programming like DeepSeek. If big 7 make any profit it will be short lived. HE/SW life cycle very short. Any underwriter not following scientific papers is not doing due diligence. But, the fed balance sheet has over $2.5 trillion in MBS, etc. Most with >10 years left. Might as well tranche the big 7 debts and move on. Buckle up! Reuters just reported CDS’ are being drawn up on big AI risk. Weinstein, Saba…. Is this the report you mean? https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/weinsteins-saba-sells-credit-derivatives-big-tech-as-ai-risks-grow-source-says-2025-11-17/ Boaz Weinstein’s Saba Capital Management has sold credit derivatives in recent months to lenders seeking protection on big tech names like Oracle and Microsoft due to concerns over a debt-financed AI investment frenzy, a source told Reuters. Banks have sought to shield their exposure to potential losses by buying credit default swaps (CDS) from the U.S. hedge fund manager, known for his winning bet against the JPMorgan Chase, opens new tab trader dubbed the “London Whale”, the person said. While the credit insurance rises in value in tandem with the perceived risk of a company’s default, current prices indicate those risks are still low compared to other sectors. Yes, thank you for linking it here…. “current prices indicate those risks are still low compared to other sectors.” is a stretch! Jensen Huang says NVDA will sell $500 to $600 billion in GPU chips next couple of years…. where will the money come from? i dont really believe in the ability of companies to supply data centers with enough electricity in the long run. thus in my mind, the fate of data centers many years down the line is likely some sort of looting for parts – if not electrical components, then the base metals used in the electrical components. additionally, the oversupply of datacenters begs another question: what about the data? how are they getting enough data to compute in these centers? you need either more experimental data being gathered (phones, surveillance, maybe drones) or something from ab initio guys. Jeff Bezos has entered the chat… I think this is becoming as silly as the original Dot Com bubble. According to the Guardian article you linked, so has Michael Burry. Michael Burry, best known for accurately predicting the 2008 housing crisis, recently invested $1bn in bets that Palantir and Nvidia shares will fall just days after he accused some of the big tech firms of using accounting tricks to “artificially boost earnings”. Thanks for posting this article. I’m still trying to digest it all. I think this is related – has anybody noticed what’s happening to RAM? Prices are going nuts: RAM: WTF? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hLiwNViMak A memory upgrade that I was looking at earlier this year for around $120 is now approaching $500. I don’t know if this will bleed into prices for other devices that use RAM and other ICs used in server grade hardware, but if this keeps up, it will. All so we can have things like AI targeted data scrapping and ads, lay off entry level workers of all sorts, and OpenAI’s big deal – AI p0rn. Really? Yeah, really: OpenAI’s ChatGPT will soon allow ‘erotica’ for adults in major policy shift https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/15/erotica-coming-to-chatgpt-this-year-says-openai-ceo-sam-altman.html China is using AI to do things like reduce the cost of healthcare and enhance manufacturing (I think this is a repeat link): China’s AI hospitals will transform medicine across the world. But not in the United States. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDmFB7AQSR0 I’ll have to keep looking around at how AI will be used in America hoping to find where it will be used to assist humans doing jobs – I’m sure it’s out there rather than all the crazy AI stuff that actually pops up unwanted. AI friends for kids? Yikes! NO! I’ve come across a couple of instances where medical researchers in the U.S. are using AI. In one they’re attempting to discover possible cures to various diseases through the off-label use of existing medications. The Medical Matchmaking Machine Radiolab (1 hour, 12 minute audio). This is quite a story as the principal researcher was a doctor who, without AI, discovered an off-label use for an existing medication to save his own life and that of others. Other researchers are using AI to develop new drugs without much success as of yet. AI Was Supposed To Discover New Drugs. Where Are They? Science Friday (18 minute audio with transcript) Thanks! Other researchers are using AI to develop new drugs without much success as of yet. AI Was Supposed To Discover New Drugs. Where Are They? Years of human trials and millions or billions of dollars of investment will happen before the AI- discovered candidate molecules — and I know of plenty — which make it through the process will arrive. That’s how the real world works. New drugs don’t just magically appear. Both these podcast transcripts eventually get to that little fact, so the headline/titles of them are essentially clickbait.

Title: Investors Now Want Crypto Just as Much as ETFs
URL: https://www.thedailyupside.com/etf/thematics-sectors/investors-now-want-crypto-just-as-much-as-etfs/

More people are planning to buy ETFs, and their biggest demands are exposure to stocks and digital assets, per BlackRock. Emile Hallez emile@thedailyupside.com The people want ETFs. And in those ETFs they want equities … and crypto. Those are the two most important categories to retail investors, according to data from a survey commissioned by BlackRock, which included 5,000 respondents in July and August. The report, published Thursday, shows changing priorities, particularly among young investors. While 66% of US investors said they owned individual stocks, 43% reported holding mutual funds. Bonds (29%), crypto assets (27%) and ETFs (23%) were behind. Still, ETFs are the fastest-growing category, and investors who already own them said they are most likely to buy equity (83%) and crypto (36%) funds during the next year. But among those who don’t yet own ETFs and plan to, there is nearly equal demand for equity (51%) and crypto (47%). “We’re witnessing a pivotal moment as individual investors embrace ETFs for their efficiency and transparency,” BlackRock head of US direct investing Amy Jenkins said in an announcement. “The predicted surge in first time ETF investors reflects a broader shift in investor preferences toward simplicity, accessibility and digital-first experiences.” Next year, of course, they’ll have plenty of options. The Securities and Exchange Commission has all but turned on a fire hose for new products, recently allowing the big exchanges to use generic listing standards for new ETFs. That’s a golden ticket for issuers who have been waiting for months to launch spot-price crypto ETFs, including those focused on a smorgasbord of meme coins. Some products have already started coming to the market, the most recent of which include index funds of spot crypto: the 21Shares FTSE Crypto 10 Index ETF (TTOP) and FTSE Crypto 10 ex-Bitcoin Select Index ETF (TXBC). Those ETFs, which launched Thursday, apply market cap weightings and hold a variety of Swiss-domiciled crypto exchange-traded products to fill in where spot-price products are not yet available domestically. Another Thursday debut was the Canary Capital XRP ETF (XRPC). “It feels just like another S&P 500 ETF,” said Federico Brokate, global head of business development at 21shares, which has a tagline for the products similar to what index fund investors are used to hearing: “Stop chasing coins. Start owning the market.” Unlike most spot crypto products, the two new ones are registered as 1940 Act (rather than 1933 Act) products. As to why investors choose ETFs, per the BlackRock survey: In Bitcoin They Trust: This all bodes well for BlackRock, which conveniently, is the world’s dominant asset manager, biggest ETF issuer and operator of the largest crypto ETP, the iShares Bitcoin Trust, which now represents about $80 billion. Only a few weeks ago, that ETF was poised to hit $100 billion in assets, though falling Bitcoin prices and a few days of net outflows have dragged its AUM down by $17 billion. It’s a reminder, especially for those new to investing, that if they like the idea of crypto, they better like volatility. No state income taxes and pro-business policies have attracted hundreds of companies to the Lone Star State. Some of the biggest companies in the ETF business haven’t been in the game for very long but are quickly gathering assets. About 900 ETFs launched this year, and dozens of highly leveraged and spot crypto products await approval. Not all of them will catch on. Fundstrat is back at the free throw line, this time with a small- and mid-cap ETF and another focused on income. Issuers are betting that advisors could benefit from exposure to a narrow slice of the aerospace defense industry. Roughly the same number of ETFs closed in the first half of 2024 and 2025, even as new product launches pick up speed. The company, which is planning to add mutual fund share classes to some of its ETFs, recently rebranded and put the State Street name on many ETFs while taking SPDR off of some. More than half of millennial ETF investors told Schwab that they can and will outperform boring old index funds. While far from the biggest ETFs on the market, spaced-themed funds are skyrocketing in 2025. ETF Upside sat down with Tuttle to discuss his approach to ETFs and what has him so interested in alien technology. ETFs that focus on clean energy investments in the US and globally have been outperforming the wider market this year, and by no small margin. The success of money market funds and their ETF counterparts has coincided with low interest rates and an uncertain macroeconomic environment. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: Capital Group, Goldman, T. Rowe Hit ETF Milestones

Some of the biggest companies in the ETF business haven’t been in the game for very long but are quickly gathering assets. Emile Hallez emile@thedailyupside.com That didn’t take too long. Several major asset managers are crossing asset milestones in their ETF businesses amid a record year for inflows industrywide. Capital Group’s three-year-old line of ETFs just hit a total of $100 billion in assets under management. Of course, no one comes close to BlackRock’s iShares or Vanguard, which at $3.9 trillion and $3.7 trillion are the dominant players in the market. But the rising profile of Capital Group, and other semi-recent entrants like T. Rowe Price, highlights the demand for new exchange-traded funds — and actively managed ones in particular. “We didn’t have them for a long time,” said John Queen, fixed income portfolio manager at Capital Group. “Even when active [ETFs] became available, we wanted to really make sure we understood the details of how they were going to play out and what the transparency meant before we started them up.” About $1.1 trillion poured into US ETFs this year through October, which was more than in all of 2024. Of that, $378 billion went into active ETFs. Total assets are now more than $13 trillion. Some of the other firms that recently surpassed or are about to hit assets-under-management milestones: Model Behavior. As niche ETF issuers have flooded the market with leveraged and thematic new funds, Capital Group and many other big asset managers have kept a focus on core-style products. To help distribute those ETFs, firms have increasingly added model portfolios. The top area where they’re building out models is now in active ETFs, according to a recent report from Morningstar. As of March, when Capital Group launched its first active ETF model portfolios, the firm was the third-largest provider, at $61 billion in assets under management, behind Wilshire ($68 billion) and BlackRock ($168 billion). “It has been an incredibly important connection with our clients and advisors, because it’s what they wanted all the time,” Queen said of Capital Group’s model portfolios and funds of funds. “It’s been a huge and important growth area for us.” More people are planning to buy ETFs, and their biggest demands are exposure to stocks and digital assets, per BlackRock. No state income taxes and pro-business policies have attracted hundreds of companies to the Lone Star State. About 900 ETFs launched this year, and dozens of highly leveraged and spot crypto products await approval. Not all of them will catch on.

Title: Harvard Pours $443,000,000 Into Bitcoin As SEC Filing Reveals Massive BlackRock IBIT Purchase

Harvard just poured a major amount of cash into the leading crypto asset, Bitcoin. A new 13F filing with the SEC shows the university’s endowment has boosted its stake in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) to 6,813,612 shares, worth about $443 million as of September 30th. This marks a 257% increase from Q2’s 1.91 million shares, worth $116 million. IBIT now tops Harvard’s US equity holdings, surpassing Microsoft at $323 million and Amazon at $235 million. Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas says the move represents a seal of approval for Bitcoin ETFs. “It’s super rare/difficult to get an endowment to bite on an ETF- esp a Harvard or Yale, it’s as good a validation as an ETF can get. That said, half a billion is a mere 1% of total endowment. Big enough to rank 16th among IBIT holders tho.” IBIT now has $81 billion in assets, capturing 35% of all spot Bitcoin ETF inflows.

Title: Bored with index funds? Here are tips for buying individual stocks.

You heard from a friend who bought some stock in Nvidia or Amazon or Apple when it was cheap, and now those shares are worth five or six figures. Those are inspiring stories. But how much can you safely invest in individual stocks? Financial planners advise armchair investors and retirement savers that the smartest move is usually to buy shares of index funds, the kind that track the performance of broad stock indexes or the entire market. Single stocks tend to be much more volatile. But millions of investors buy shares of individual stock, and lots of them have success stories. Is there a place for individual stocks in your retirement portfolio? If so, how much is too much? We asked several investment experts. Ordinary Americans are passionate about investing in individual stocks. A recent survey by the BlackRock Foundation and Commonwealth found that 54% of low- and moderate-income Americans (those earning $30,000-$80,000 a year) invest in capital markets, and that new investors favor single stocks over mutual funds and ETFs. Investors may watch YouTube and TikTok videos from influencers who claim to have can’t-miss stock picks. They troll the internet for recommendations from The Motley Fool and Morningstar. Then, they sit back and wait for a stock to take off. “There’s a certain element of fun to this,” said Zachary Rayfield, head of goals-based investing research at Vanguard. Ready to buy some individual stocks? Here are a few tips. If you invest in index funds or target-date retirement funds, your investment will probably track the market as a whole. Stock indexes do well in some years, poorly in others, but they are far less mercurial than individual stocks. With single stocks, you’re likely to see big swings, and not always up. If you’re just starting out, experts say, it’s wise to invest only a small share of your portfolio in individual stocks. That’s especially true if you’re investing with your retirement savings. “I think everyone’s retirement should be built on a foundation of index funds,” said Robert Brokamp, a senior retirement adviser at The Motley Fool. “And then you can gradually move into individual stocks,” committing “maybe 5%” of your portfolio. “And then you might find that you absolutely love it, and you can gradually increase that percentage.” However much money you invest in single stocks, investment experts say, try to avoid owning too much of one stock. “A simple rule of thumb is, do not let any one position in your portfolio account for more than 5 to 10% of the overall value of your portfolio,” said Caleb Silver, editor-in-chief of the financial journalism site Investopedia. Overconcentration can happen by accident. Let’s say you bought some shares of Nvidia a few years ago, and you watched them multiply tenfold in value. Today, those shares might make up a large share of your holdings. “Many of our members have 30% of their portfolio in Nvidia,” said Brokamp, whose site has recommended the stock for years. The problem with individual stocks is that “you’re vulnerable to steep declines of your portfolio if one of them goes down significantly,” Silver said. That’s less of a problem if the stock represents 5% of your portfolio, more concerning if it’s 30%. “Individual stocks can be a great way to complement a well-diversified portfolio, but it's important to ensure that no single security overshadows your overall mix,” said Ryan Viktorin, vice president and financial consultant at Fidelity Investments. Diversification, in investment parlance, means holding different kinds of assets. You can diversify by holding stocks in different sectors, large and small companies, American and foreign markets, and by holding things that aren’t stocks, like bonds and money market funds. If you’re devoting only 5% or 10% of your portfolio to single stocks, you don’t necessarily have to worry about diversifying those stocks. To Silver of Investopedia, “it’s better to concentrate on 5 to 10 stocks that you believe in, that have a track record,” and build sizeable holdings in those companies. “If you have invested in any of the top 10 companies in the S&P 500 over the past five years and you have built positions in those companies, you have outperformed the stock market,” Silver said. Case in point: Nvidia. Brokamp of Motley Fool suggests a broader approach. “You should own at least 25 stocks, and they should be diversified,” representing different types of companies, he said. Silver’s approach gives you larger stakes in fewer companies. Brokamp’s gives you more diversification, but you get a smaller stake in each stock. One axiom of investing dictates that actively managed funds often underperform the market as a whole. Simply put: It’s hard to beat the market by picking stocks yourself. And that rule surely applies to amateur stock pickers. “If you do this yourself, you’re becoming an active manager,” said Rayfield of Vanguard. “And a lot of active managers don’t outperform the broader market.” Savvy investors sell off diminished stocks at a loss, then use the loss to offset gains on other investments at tax time, a technique called tax-loss harvesting. Paring down underperforming stocks can leave an investor with an overly rosy view of their success. “If we’re selling the losers, sometimes we get a little high on our horse about what our capabilities are,” said Colin Day, a certified financial planner in St. Louis. “We forget the losers. We only remember the winners.” If you invest in a significant number of single stocks, Brokamp said, expect them to drift in different directions, some rising, some falling. The returns won’t resemble the path of a broad index fund, which captures the collective movement of many stocks. “Many of your individual stocks will be duds,” Brokamp said. “It’s the handful of successes that will drive your return.”

Title: The new business deals, Zelensky, the…sea bass and the Pax Americana, how the M.M. treats Samaras, Metlen’s new acquisition and the sale of Iktinos

Time Published: 2025-11-17T08:01:28Z

Hello, some thoughts on today’s anniversary of the Polytechnic uprising. Usually, all over the world, after a few years have passed from a historic event for a country, the state, the protagonists—if they are still alive—and society honor that very event with ceremonies of remembrance and respect, some tributes, but generally with peaceful demonstrations of collective memory. In Greece, 52 years later, the day of the uprising of students and other citizens against the Junta becomes an occasion to smash and wreck Athens, to destroy with paint the…martyr-like (in every sense) façade of the Polytechnic and, by the end of the day, to burn…a few shops in the center of Athens with Molotov cocktails, right in front of the eyes of thousands of stunned tourists who are still enjoying—mid-November—the blessed Greek weather. If this is what we want half a century later, let us reflect on it. But I think that the overwhelming majority of people do not want this, without it meaning that they do not honor the people who rose up then against the Junta and who either risked or lost their lives. Business and Pax Americana Beyond that, everything we have seen for the past 15 days happening in Athens regarding the geopolitical and business agreements with the USA was completed yesterday with the arrival of Zelensky, who came to sign that Ukraine will procure—via Greece—American LNG. As for the rest of what he is asking, mainly in weapons and such, I don’t think he will get it, and I think the most substantial meeting he had here yesterday was with Ambassador Guilfoyle regarding the agreement, and not only that, since of course he is very interested in the direct and effective access she has to the President of the United States. In any case, let me repeat that for the last three weeks the “American factor” has been steadily here, building deals and business agreements, and is not in Turkey, with whatever that implies. But mainly, what interests everyone is the security of the country against Turkey, which, of course, is primarily ensured by the Americans. That “I am here” which Guilfoyle said recently at the Greece Talks conference last Friday, when she was asked about the Eastern threat, is currently linked with the “Vertical Corridor,” which not only passes through Greece but is the entry gate for American natural gas into Europe. Sea bass and LNG I should tell you that the atmosphere yesterday at the Maximos Mansion was very warm, while K.M. had also planned to host Zelensky and the Ukrainian delegation. After the statements and the signing of the gas agreement, there was a lunch for the two delegations, with a menu of sea bass with greens and bouillabaisse, and I hear that Zelensky didn’t drink wine. Now, I don’t know whether he liked the sea bass, but the agreement for the supply of gas was certainly crucial for him, as winter in Ukraine is baring its teeth. This agreement was essentially the follow-up to the agreement announced at P-TEC for the AKTOR–DEPA partnership for LNG transport, and it will go into operation at the end of December. Immediate profits from LNG for AKTOR Taking the opportunity from what we said earlier, let me add an important business tip. As announced, DEPA Commercial and Naftogaz of Ukraine yesterday signed a Declaration of Intent for the supply of natural gas to the Ukrainian market for the winter period, from December 2025 to March 2026. The agreement stipulates that the transport of LNG from the USA will be carried out via “Route 1,” which has been allocated to the Transmission System Operators (TSOs). If we “translate” the announcement in business terms, it means that the interstate agreement will be executed via Atlantic-See LNG Trade (of Venture Global, AKTOR, and DEPA). Consequently, the trade of American LNG starts immediately, from mid-December, and not in 2030—something that means that AKTOR’s 60% subsidiary will already begin to produce results for its balance sheet from early 2026, since the results of Atlantic-See LNG are consolidated into those of AKTOR. In other words, the AKTOR group begins to record profits from the new activity much earlier. Kimberly and the drones As for energy matters and Greece’s decision to play the card of this agreement, do not overlook the role of Kimberly Guilfoyle, who has come to Greece with a clear agenda, which she described last Friday at Greece Talks. Let me add, parenthetically, that her interview generated a lot of discussion and she herself was satisfied because she conveyed clear messages. Beyond that, this time there was little discussion about weapons in the foreground, but something is moving in the background. For example, I do not consider it coincidental that the Chief of the Hellenic National Defense General Staff, Choupis, was present yesterday at noon at the Maximos Mansion, as he participated in the extended meeting of the delegations. The Ukrainians are definitely asking for weapons that we cannot provide, such as Patriots. But we do have some “decommissioned” Russian weapons that have not been supported for some years now. I hear that the Ukrainians have begun to put on the table the provision of Ukrainian drones to our country in return, but an agreement is still a way off. The interview on ERT Before departing for Singapore on Wednesday (he will return on Saturday), K.M. is expected, as I hear, to give an in-depth, wide-ranging interview. It will be on the morning show of ERTNews (Papachlimintzos–Douka), his first appearance on public television since the launch of the new news channel. Whether it will be Tuesday or Wednesday will likely be “locked in” today. Stamatis and Mitsotakis Yesterday, after a hard battle with cancer, Dimitris Stamatis passed away—a modest, serious, and always conciliatory politician, a close friend of Antonis Samaras. I was struck by the excerpt in Mitsotakis’ condolence statement: “…when we served together in the government under Antonis Samaras.” A similar statement was made by Skertsos, referring to his presence in the 2012–14 government: “…when we kept the country together during the difficult years under the guidance of A. Samaras and E. Venizelos.” I have the impression that the entire New Democracy party, from K.M. down to the rank-and-file members, will view Samaras in a completely opposite way from how he views them—and especially the Prime Minister. Pavlos Marinakis Pavlos Marinakis’ bill regarding ERT, the media it regulates, their long-standing pending issues, and also the rule of law, passed triumphantly through Parliament’s competent committees on Friday, and all the relevant sector bodies spoke highly of it—even those… politically opposed. Tsapanidou from SYRIZA, as well as almost the rest of the opposition, were against it, proving why these people are “elsewhere” and generally unable to understand that blanket refusal leads nowhere. METLEN submits an offer, PPC goes to London for the business plan Moving on to market news—which today I assume will shift into a different pattern after the Fitch upgrade and the news from Euronext. The week begins with significant business developments from major groups and smaller listed companies. First of all, today METLEN submits its financial offer for the acquisition of the aluminum plant in Dunkirk. If the bet pays off, the profile of the metallurgy sector for METLEN will change, with the group adding to the sector (based on last year’s results) an annual EBITDA of about €300 million and net profits of €150 million. The baton is passed on Wednesday to PPC, which is presenting in London the business plan that is said to involve investments of over €10 billion for the period 2026–2028. The focus is on whether PPC’s announcements will confirm the recent market rumors of a roughly €1 billion capital increase at €14 per share, combined with interest from BlackRock in acquiring a significant stake. Preliminary agreement between IKTINOS and a fund Since I mentioned smaller listed companies earlier, let me add that the management of IKTINOS is taking steps to leverage its assets with the goal of freeing the listed company from debt. In this context, according to information, IKTINOS is said to have reached a preliminary agreement with a foreign fund for the 2,500-acre property it owns in the Faneromeni bay in Sitia, Crete. Developments are expected immediately. National Insurance acquisition by December 5 The acquisition of 100% of National Insurance by Piraeus Bank is in its final stretch, as the Bank of Greece has granted approval and next week approval is also expected from the SSM. By December 5, based on the dates given by the authorities, the acquisition will have been completed, and the second essential chapter begins for the insurance company but also for the banks (Piraeus Bank and National Bank) in terms of bancassurance. I’m no prophet, but something tells me that this chapter will not be exhausted “from one moment to the next,” as we say. It will require a lot of groundwork both from Piraeus Bank and from the National Bank. It is a structural change that reshapes long-standing relationships with many technical and legal issues, and some time will be needed before it wraps up. Hellenic Exchanges (ATHEX) in the arms of Euronext Now regarding HELEX, which we mentioned above: last Thursday and especially Friday, individual small shareholders of HELEX showed that they are convinced by the Public Offer of Stéphane Boujnah and handed over their shares to brokerage firms, which in turn mobilized even more because of the special 0.4% commission they had on the transaction. Today at 2 p.m. the process formally closes, with the acceptance rate—according to market information—expected to exceed 55% and move toward 60%. Success is considered a given, but the column reserves judgment on the exact percentage. What is certain is that the strategy paid off: institutional investors—Greek and foreign funds that already held Euronext shares—hurried to exchange. For them, the transition was a simple administrative move without tax implications. Individuals acted on Thursday and Friday. The fact is that after the results are announced the day after tomorrow, November 19, the Athens Stock Exchange enters the pan-European network. On November 24, HELEX shares will be traded simultaneously in Amsterdam, Brussels, Lisbon, and Paris. The next chapter is the squeeze-out: Euronext will seek 90% or more so as to integrate HELEX into the group. Byte: heading for EBITDA over €10 million in the 9-month period Byte, as IDEAL presented last October during Investor Day, is transforming into the parent company for its IT investments, with subsidiaries Adacom and Bluestream. According to information, the picture of the 9-month results follows a trajectory similar to that of the first half. If we compare these figures, then we expect revenue above €75 million and EBITDA above €10 million. I hear that the company’s executives are very pleased because the gross profit margin is increasing by more than 7 points and the EBITDA margin is stabilizing at 15%, over 4% higher than last year. They also say that the contribution of projects carried out by the companies abroad is significant and represents a new pillar for future growth. IDEAL’s results on Thursday, 20/11, will likely confirm management’s expectations as presented in October. The next step is to see whether the strong results will be reflected in the share price and whether IT sector valuations will help IDEAL. Swiss-franc loans: institutionally yes… technically maybe The Ministry of National Economy and Finance is working full-time on the institutional framework for the restructuring of Swiss-franc loans, listening to the banks but clearly keeping its focus on the borrowers. The legislative framework is expected to be ready by the end of the year. However, its implementation may require a longer time. The technical aspect of implementation is not the simplest. It is therefore very likely that the platform of the out-of-court settlement mechanism will be used for the Swiss-franc loan restructurings. The adjustments required to allow both vulnerable and non-vulnerable borrowers to enter are technically complex and may require some time. Even if a new application is developed to serve this purpose, it too will need time. Giannis Mytilineos’ new companies “Sea Front Bliss I” and “Sea Front Bliss II” are the names of the two new companies founded last Friday, November 14, and are owned by businessman Giannis Mytilineos. The purpose of the two companies, headquartered in Varibombi, is—among other things—the buying and selling and management of real estate and, in particular, the construction of buildings either for own use or for exploitation in any way, or for resale, located anywhere in Greece or abroad. Also, the construction, leasing, subleasing, renovation, repair, expansion, maintenance, exploitation, management and general utilization of all kinds of properties, urban or otherwise, owned by the company or third parties; the establishment, construction, operation, management and exploitation of all types of hotels and tourist units, housing complexes, sports facilities, etc. The initial share capital totals €3,300,000, specifically €2,200,000 for “Sea Front Bliss I” and €1,100,000 for “Sea Front Bliss II,” divided into shares with a nominal value of €100 each. The sole shareholder is the Cypriot company Nioval Ltd, whose sole shareholder is Giannis Mytilineos, who, as is well known, in addition to his other activities (shipping, etc.) also owns the emblematic Tatoi Club. The management of the two newly established companies includes Anastasia Mouchlidi as Chairwoman and CEO, Elisavet Paraskeopoulou, and Mytilineos’ two daughters, Amalia and Ioli, as members. They are the same individuals, in the same roles, who staff Tatoi Residences, the company founded last March. The book of Odysseas Athanasiou On November 25, the book “Why They Succeeded – 6 States from the Shadows to the Top,” written by Lamda Development CEO Odysseas Athanasiou, is expected to be released. The head of LAMDA, who has been at the helm of the group since the late 2000s, will speak at the launch event about his book, for which he offers an initial idea of its subject, stating that it is “a personal search regarding how small countries without natural resources or power managed to rise to the top. It is not a book about economics or politics. It is a book about how the right choices and faith in people can change a country’s future.” The presentation will take place on Tuesday, 2/12/25, at the National Gallery, and speaking about Athanasiou’s writing project will be the Governor of the Bank of Greece, Yiannis Stournaras, and EKPA professor Maria Efthymiou. A Thessalonian at the World Bank The information comes from reliable sources, although for now there is no official announcement. Antonis Kamaras, a scholar from Thessaloniki with a rich academic and professional background, will be Greece’s representative at the World Bank. It is a position held from 2013 to 2021 by Christos Papoutsis (former minister and European Commissioner under PASOK), and from early 2021 by a woman for the first time, economist Eleni Panagiotarea (daughter of journalist Anna Panagiotarea). For the past year, the position had remained vacant. Now it is being taken up by Antonis Kamaras, who studied at Connecticut College and the London School of Economics and has worked professionally as a consultant at the National Bank of Greece and the Municipality of Thessaloniki. He is a researcher at ELIAMEP and a founding member of the Greek Diaspora Project at SEESOX (Oxford). The…crazy regulation that favors high-speed ships over conventional ones A puzzle remains regarding how ferry routes are scheduled. Today two different rules apply: conventional ships must operate all year round, while high-speed vessels can operate for at least four months. However, the market picture has changed radically: 12 years ago there were just 13 high-speed vessels; today there are 34. This has two consequences:a) Huge fluctuations in prices. On routes with competition, ticket prices can fall to €0.60/mile, while as soon as competition disappears they rise to €3.25/mile.b) Conventional ships, which are obliged to operate in winter, are financially squeezed in summer by the high-speed vessels and struggle to make the year viable. The Competition Commission notes that if this asymmetry continues, there is a risk that winter routes will be reduced, something that would harm the cohesion of the islands. Silent Chinese wave at the Port of Piraeus The US and China may have temporarily buried the hatchet in their business-trade war, but each continues to keep a close eye on the other. The news that the Americans are planning a strategic investment to create an alternative commercial corridor to counter COSCO and the Port of Piraeus—by promoting Elefsina—did not go unnoticed in Beijing. At Greece’s main port, a plan has long been sitting in the drawers: the construction of a fourth pier, in the space between the car terminal and Pier I. This project is not part of COSCO’s mandatory commitments. Piraeus, due to the large volumes it handles, is running out of vital space, approaching its ceiling of 5.5 million TEUs. A fourth pier would give the Chinese operators the ability to increase container throughput by at least one million TEUs. However, without the authorities’ green light, the Chinese cannot move forward, so they are keeping a wait-and-see stance, monitoring developments. “There’s a certain silence,” people from the port told me. Greek shipping at full throttle Greek shipping groups continue to sweep both the shipyards and the secondhand market. On the newbuilding front, Thenamaris (Nikolas Martinou), StealthGas (Harry Vafias), Venergy (Byron Vasileiadis), and Akrotiri Tankers (Marielena Prokopiou & Konstantinos Lampsias) led the way with fresh tanker orders, investing in modern, scrubber-fitted vessels—an indication that the major players are looking long-term and betting on cleaner, more efficient shipping. Meanwhile, Costamare and Latsco remain active in containerships, strengthening their presence in East Asian shipyards. In the secondhand market, Greek activity was visible on both the buying and selling sides, especially in dry bulk. Aegean Bulk stood out by selling the Supramax Anemos (2011), while another Greek group acquired the Isolda D (Handysize, 2011). Overall, over the last twelve months Greek shipowners have signed 43 new tanker orders, 6 bulk carrier orders, and conducted 41 tanker acquisitions and 98 bulker purchases in the resale market. Greece thus comfortably maintains its global lead in S&P activity. Trek enters the Athens Exchange Alternative Market Today marks the start of trading for Trek Development on the ASE Alternative Market. The Papapolyzos family company is active in infrastructure project development and construction, with a focus on energy, environment, water management, and Smart City applications. After 30 years of operations, the company is moving to its next phase, planning an investment program of €4.6 million, financed by €1.9 million from the listing and €2.7 million from internal funds and projected profits for 2025–2027. About 30% of the plan concerns organic growth—primarily staffing and upgrading the operations of its Munich subsidiary—while 70% will go toward acquiring specialized companies in Greece and the EU. Four stocks looking for new highs The Titan share has been unstoppable for the past five sessions, rallying from €40 to nearly €44 and inching closer to its record of €45.8. The driver is the cement group’s four-year plan, involving investments up to €4 billion and EBITDA of €1 billion by 2029. Also on the table is the acquisition of the French company Vracs De L’Estuaire, with Titan in exclusive talks. Analysts reinforce the positive mood: Citi has set a target price of €56.1, S&P upgraded Titan’s rating to BB+, and Fitch raised its outlook to positive. Motor Oil exceeded €28 intraday over the last two sessions, closing just below that mark. With six consecutive gains, the stock would hit a new all-time high with an additional 2.2% rise. It’s a remarkable comeback for a share that had dropped below €20 seven months ago, with the interim dividend of €0.35 providing momentum. Viohalco remains in the spotlight, hitting a new high and approaching €10. Its subsidiary ElvalHalcor is following suit, extending its multi-year high and aiming to reach €3.5 for the first time since November 2007. A new era for EY Greece, in a historic Thessaloniki landmark The historic Matarasso–Altshech building—one of Thessaloniki’s most iconic Art Deco structures—will now house EY Greece’s administrative base in the city. Designed in the 1930s by architect Moshe Kazis, and once home to the Athens Stock Exchange’s local branch, the building has been transformed into a modern, flexible, and inclusive workspace while preserving its original identity. The renovation respected the building’s historic architecture, retaining signature elements of the era while adapting the space to the needs of a modern international consulting organization. The new facilities will host teams serving clients across sectors from finance to technology. On 22–23 November, the public will be able to take a look inside as part of EY’s Open House. A flood of money in the markets The terms are Money Supply M2 and M3, referring to the total money circulating in an economy at a given moment. Globally, this money stock reached $142 trillion in September 2025—an all-time record that reveals a fundamental shift in the world economy. The +9.1% increase in 2025 alone represents around $12 trillion. Over the past 25 years (since 2000), global money supply has grown at an average 7% CAGR, with only brief pauses during the 2008 crisis and the 2020 pandemic. After each crisis, the rebound was rapid and monetary expansion even stronger. Central banks face a dilemma: interest rate hikes since 2022 should have restricted liquidity, yet money supply continues to expand. The 2025 depreciation of the US dollar is the hidden key: as money loses value, investors are forced to shift into assets that protect against inflation. Capital seeks refuge from devaluation—and investing becomes not a choice, but a survival necessity for capital. Explore related questions

Title: Bitcoin: November 2025 turns historic – For all the wrong reasons

Analyzing why Bitcoin is at risk of the biggest ETF outflows ever. Bitcoin is facing its second-biggest ETF outflows since its launch, and could set a new record. It was unlikely that the price of Bitcoin could reverse the losses incurred in November if it ends in red. Bitcoin [BTC] slipped below the $100,000 mark and continued to trade below it as Bitcoin ETFs and quarterly returns followed the drain. In the meantime, the entire crypto market rose slightly by less than a percent while the Fear & Greed Index hit 17, dipping to extreme fear levels. Currently, the market seems to be heading towards its worst-ever month in terms of BTC ETF outflows and quarterly returns. As per data from SosoValue, Bitcoin ETFs were seeing the second-biggest outflow in 2025, which was at $2.33 billion while the month was still midway. Similar outflows through the remaining weeks would see November hit a new record. This year’s February had the biggest ETF outflows, which almost hit $4 billion. However, given that Bitcoin has now entered a discount zone after falling below $100K, the outflows could potentially reverse. Source: SosoValue The outflows have stemmed from the overall weakness seen in the market, with BTC’s price also facing a similar fate. Particularly, BlackRock, Grayscale, Bitwise, and Fidelity led outflows in the past 24 hours, as per CoinGlass data. BlackRock saw more than 4.65K BTC in outflows, contributing to more than 94% of the total 4.94K BTC on the day. Bitcoin continued to struggle in terms of quarterly returns, as did Ethereum [ETH], which reflected a general market weakness. Since 2018, when BTC lost more than 42% in the last quarter, this year’s quarter has come the closest. However, this quarter’s loss still represents about a third of that of 2018. Other years were 2022 and 2019, which lost about 14.75% and 13.54%, respectively, as per CoinGlass data. Source: CoinGlass Ethereum was also seeing its worst returns since 2019. The returns were a reflection of the lost confidence among traders in the crypto sector. Historical data indicated that every red November was followed by a similar December, making it unlikely for BTC to reverse this sentiment. The pattern was evident in 2018, 2019, 2021, and 2022, which were red in the last two months of the year. On the charts, BTC price slipped below a 15-month trendline support, as per Trader Tardigrade’s analysis on X (formerly Twitter). This further stressed the weakness of Bitcoin and its products, like ETFs. Reclaiming the support level would be very bullish for BTC, while the reverse would extend losses. The next area of interest on the downside is around $80K, while on the upside, it is sitting at $126K. Source: Trader Tardigrade Notably, only a change in crypto market sentiment would change the current downtrend in price action, returns, and BTC ETF flows. November was headed to be the biggest with outflows if the current trend stayed. However, given that prices had been declining for over a month and were at significant discounts, there was still potential for a rebound.

Oh ye of little faith. For three weeks, on and off the record, coaches and players alike had been telling us they had a performance like this in the making. And on a squally Saturday night in a packed Aviva, so a record win over Australia came to pass. This was a well-timed reminder to themselves, the world of punditry and the supporters that Ireland remain a very good side. “That’s a given for me,” maintained Andy Farrell, who was critical of the previous two displays but never lost faith in his team’s ability. “We’re a very good side. There’s no doubt about that. You could put in all sorts of reasons of why the first performance or the second performance or whatever, but that’s never been in doubt, in my mind anyway.” Breaking free, in some respects from their own shackles, Ireland shot out of the blocks and then finished with a flourish, the replacements contributing to a true squad effort. They bookended the game with a Mack Hansen hat-trick in the first half-hour and another three tries in an expressive and clinical last 10 minutes. “Sometimes you prepare really well and it doesn’t transfer,” reflected Farrell. “We had an unbelievable warm-up out there today and I was going, ‘wow, if Carlsberg could do warm-ups, that would be it. But that doesn’t transfer either sometimes. I’ve seen unbelievably rubbish warm-ups and seen teams play well. So, it’s nice that we prepare well and we’ve got a performance on the back of it.” There was also the palpable ripple effects of the international football team’s memorable night last Thursday. “Yeah, it was class,” said Jack Conan of Ireland’s 2-0 win over Portugal – and this was before Sunday’s extraordinary events in Budapest. “A few of the lads went who weren’t involved and everyone’s kind of jealous that they went and a lot of us didn’t go, but it was on in the team room and we were loving it. “You looked at Thursday night and the atmosphere here and it was class. You know, Aaron Rowe singing Amhrán na bhFiann, which was brilliant and the lads would know him quite well. We were loving that and even just the performance and the doggedness of how the lads played on Thursday night was unreal,” added Conan. “We loved it and yeah, we talked about riding that wave of momentum.” The same can be said of the coming week and surfing an even bigger wave in the light of the Republic of Ireland’s dramatic 3-2 win in Budapest, as Farrell’s team prepare to welcome the all-conquering, multi-faceted South Africa. After their ominous 14-man win over France in Paris, Rassie Erasmus rested most of his frontliners for Saturday’s imperious 32-14 win over Italy in Turin, again achieved despite playing the majority of the game with 14 men. They arrive as the world’s number one side and back-to-back world champions. “Yeah, it’s great,” said Farrell of a perfectly scripted finale to the Autumn Nations Series and at an ideal kick-off time, 5.40pm, next Saturday. “It’s a fantastic place to be, isn’t it? The best in the world, everyone’s talking about them and the type of rugby that they’re playing. A rich vein of form and rightly so. They’ve played some brilliant stuff. “It’s a fantastic way to finish off our autumn. The last game at the Aviva. We’ll certainly enjoy this win, but the lads will be back on task and they’ll know what it means to everyone in Irish rugby as well, so we’ll look forward to that.” Yet again, all Farrell’s selection hunches were vindicated, not least Hansen at full-back. He completed only the second first-half hat-trick of tries by an Irish player in Test history. The first to do it was Eugene Davy in 1930, in a 14-11 win over Scotland at Murrayfield. [ ‘The worst team in Wallabies history’: Australian media show displeasure at Ireland defeatOpens in new window ] “Well, he gets rugby,” said Farrell of Hansen. “He can make a difference within the game. And also he’s got a good feel in the backfield. He understands the depth perception and all of that. He’s obviously very good in the air and in conditions like that, it’s always going to help any team. “He’s always been very good in the air. His skillset lends it to being that. He’s been brought up playing 10, 15 and wing. That’s why he’s such a nice player to watch.” It helped that the lineout delivered a perfect 10 and the Paddy McCarthy-infused scrum was potent, with Dan Sheehan and Caelan Doris delivering big games in a strong Irish pack. The confidence to stay positive, to keep trying things even after the inevitable mistakes on such a greasy surface and on such a wet and windy night, in many ways emanated from the calmness and inventiveness of Sam Prendergast. Here, in tandem with Jamison Gibson-Park, who seems somehow to be playing at 100 miles an hour while in cruise control, Prendergast was the orchestrator in chief of the Irish game. As well as his easy-on-the-eye control and array of passes, he and Gibson-Park terrorised the Wallabies back three, and particularly Max Jorgensen, with their aerial bombardment and variety of kicks. The reconfigured backrow, with Doris at seven for the first 50 minutes, perhaps had one eye on the Springboks. The same may also be said for playing Gibson-Park at fullback for the last 10 minutes in considering a 6-2 bench split. Gibson-Park applied the coup de grace with a cross-kick for Robbie Henshaw to score Ireland’s sixth try with the last play. “He’s going to start at seven next week,” quipped Farrell. “He was playing touch rugby and just enjoying himself. He’s just enjoying himself. He’s tough, strong as well. What a player.” While the unlucky Stuart McCloskey suffered a recurrence of the groin issues which forced him off in Chicago, Farrell expects to have Josh van der Flier and Garry Ringrose back in the mix. In a positive way, he has a number of selection considerations. Scoring sequence – 6 mins: Hansen try, S Prendergast con 7-0; 11: Hansen try, S Prendergast con 14-0; 18: Ikitau try, O’Connor con 14-7; 28: Hansen try 19-14; 40: McReight try, O’Connor con 19-14; Half-time 19-14; 57: Prendergast dg 22-14; 63: Crowley pen 25-14; 70: Doris try, Crowley con 32-14; 74: Pollard try 32-19; 78: Baird try, Crowley con 39-19; 81: Henshaw try, Crowley con 46-19 IRELAND: M Hansen; T O’Brien, R Henshaw, S McCloskey, J Lowe; S Prendergast, J Gibson-Park; P McCarthy, D Sheehan, T Furlong, J Ryan, T Beirne, R Baird, C Doris (capt), J Conan.

We know how they look – and perform – on the pitch. But how do they tackle looking glamorous off the pitch? Here, three Leinster rugby players – Eimear Corri Fallon, Vicky Elmes Kinlan and Hannah Wilson – show their flair dressing up and share their style secrets. Vicky Elmes Kinlan, from Rathnew, Co Wicklow, started playing rugby at the age of 12, encouraged by her father, Mick. She now represents Wicklow RFC at club level, and has played for Ireland on both the Sevens and 15s teams. “I am very basic when it comes to style and know what suits my body type, so I stick to what I know. I am more muscly on my upper half and dress to suit that,” she says. “I love pants, long skirts worn with smaller tops. I buy online while also checking out the sales. “I tend to prefer neutral colours and don’t like pattern. I would never have tried on this dress, but it pushed me out of my comfort zone, and I now like it. I usually wear something more fitted, but I like its flowy silhouette. I never really wear dresses, even to dinner dances, where most girls wear floor length, though I did wear a blue one to my debs. “I love gold jewellery. I like the way people express themselves in how they dress.” White ruffle dress, Rixo, €373; metallic shoes, Dune, €80; earrings, Astrid & Miyu, €115 Wilson, a promising young backline talent for Leinster Women’s Rugby, started playing at the age of five in Kildare. She plays club rugby with Old Belvedere and earned selection for the Ireland U-20 women’s squad in 2024. “I have never worn a skirt until now, as I just don’t feel comfortable in them – I tend to wear jeans, dressy trousers and a jumper with trainers. I buy a lot from All Saints, but I also have a black two-piece from Reiss. I don’t like showing my bruised legs all the way up when I don’t have to wear training outfits. “I’m not a big shopper, but I like to buy when there is a purpose. I have a big build, so I have to try everything on before I buy. I stick to neutrals – black, beige, grey with a bit of denim. “I get my hair colour done every four months. I feel more pressure of people watching me on rather than off the pitch, and always have my tan when I know there will be pictures because I am so pale. I also wear braids – six! – in my hair. It’s sore getting them, but they are better than a ponytail that gets messed up in a scrum. “I love silver jewellery and used to wear seven rings on my fingers along with bracelets – I have one Cartier ring, which I got for my 18th, and a Tiffany silver ring I got for my 21st. “What I love about rugby is the feeling of success and having a purpose to get up in the morning. And of course, the friendship.” Coat, Maje, €386; linen waistcoat, Rixo, €80; linen midi skirt, Rixo, €230; gold heeled sandals, €248 From Laois and a former player with Portlaoise RFC, Eimear Corri Fallon announced her retirement from international rugby earlier this month to focus on her career as a doctor (she studied sports science at Dublin City University and medicine at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland), but will still represent Leinster Rugby Women and Blackrock College RFC at club level. “I started playing at 23. Athletics was my background. Medicine came into my head when I was studying sports science, and the health module made me realise my interest in the human body and physiology. “I’ve loved fashion since I was a child, and I’m a shopaholic. Scrubs and rugby kit are not so glamorous, but you don’t have a choice. I like to express myself through clothes, and I love bright colours so there are no pastels in my wardrobe but big blues or pinks. My style is casual – city-wear jeans and a lot of blazers, but when I am going out, I go all out with make-up hair, sequins and satin skirts. I love skorts because I am quite tall, which I wear with long or knee-length boots – they are a game changer. I would never wear pastels nor midi dresses, and cargo pants don’t suit me. “I’d describe my style as bright, fun and elegant chic. I buy in Kildare Village, Sandra, Maje and Self Portrait, and I love buying make-up as well. I work in Naas hospital as a doctor in A&E five days a week and on call at weekends, so it’s a bright pair of royal blue scrubs. “I would not usually go for a full co-ordinating suit like this one – it’s such a statement piece – but would wear one piece with something else. So my style is primarily casual. Footwear tends to be low block heels.” Cropped jacket, Maje, €295; trousers, Maje, €195; heels, Dune, €85 All clothes and accessories from Kildare Village, a partner of Leinster Rugby, shot on location in Drew Studios in Dublin.

With assets under management (AUM) exceeding ₹7,000 crore (over $800 million), Artha Bharat is already in advanced discussions with five independent investment management teams who plan to use its platform to launch funds ranging from $5 million to $50 million.

This model marks a new phase in India’s fund management ecosystem , enabling talented fund managers to establish regulated schemes in GIFT City without the heavy financial and administrative burden of setting up a separate fund management entity. “This is an excellent initiative by the IFSCA aimed at spurring entrepreneurship amongst talented fund managers who may lack the financial resources needed to float their own fund management entity in GIFT City,” added Sawrikar. Artha Bharat currently manages three diversified funds from GIFT City: * Artha Global Opportunities Fund – focused on private credit, distressed debt, and private equity opportunities. * Artha Global Multiplier Fund – a long-short, absolute-return hedge fund investing in the US markets. * Artha Bharat Absolute Return Fund – a USD-denominated arbitrage fund investing across equities, commodities, and interest rate futures, designed to deliver competitive short-term returns versus traditional fixed-income avenues. With operations spread across Mauritius, Dubai, and Abu Dhabi, and a rapidly expanding presence in GIFT City, Artha Bharat continues to position itself as a leading alternative investment platform for global and NRI investors.

Shares up 1% on the NSE to Rs 115.40 Shares of Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles plunged 7.2% to a seven-month low of ₹363, trading as major losers of Nifty 50 components, after Jaguar Land Rover’s fiscal 2026 margin target. CEA Anantha Nageswaran: India’s equity markets have grown impressively, but initial public offerings have increasingly become exit vehicles for early investors rather than mechanisms for raising long-term capital. This undermines the spirit of public markets. CEA: India cannot rely predominantly on bank credit for long-horizon financing. A deep and reliable bond market is a strategic necessity, particularly for financing long-term national objectives.

Loyal Equipments stock traded flat on the BSE at Rs 207.65 Natural Gas Futures may correct to ₹370; consider buying on dips for potential gains up to ₹445. Last week’s larger market sell-off, which was triggered by hawkish comments from U.S. Federal Reserve officials that dampened expectations for a December interest rate cut, caused gold prices to drop 2.5% and silver prices to drop 5.5%. In the meantime, the Federal Reserve is citing the shutdown blackout as justification for maintaining unchanged interest rates in December. Naturally, this is in line with the proverb, “Do nothing when you do not know what to do.” Since the beginning of last week, the US dollar’s weakness and rumours that the Fed would resume asset purchases have served as catalysts for gold’s rise, but Thursday and Friday made it abundantly evident that this is no longer the case. Additionally, gold and silver faced pressure from position closing to meet margin calls brought on by declines in equity markets, which fell on Friday after the global selloff sparked by hawkish Fed signals. Market expectations for a 25 basis-point rate cut next month dropped to 42% from 64% earlier this week, down from more than 95% a month ago, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool. The longest U.S. government shutdown ended Thursday, creating a major data gap that left the Fed and traders flying blind ahead of next month’s policy meeting. The U.S. government shutdown lasted 43 days, the longest in history, but the effects will likely be felt for the next few weeks. Some economic data, such as October’s CPI numbers, will be lost forever because that information is collected manually. For economists, this could be a significant issue because economic modelling depends on reliable, consistent data. In the end, inflation is not high enough to stop the Fed — especially as it continues to face pressure from President Donald Trump — from cutting interest rates, and even if the central bank skips the December meeting, rates will be lower in 2026. While there are clear signs that the U.S. labour market is losing significant momentum, even without October’s economic data, inflation is also not accelerating. One Federal Reserve meeting will not affect gold’s long-term fundamental support. There is uncertainty regarding the U.S. economy, tariffs, and the next interest rate move, so any pullback is likely to be short and shallow as the main drivers of gold remain in place.If gold prices sustain above $4150, we are likely to see the uptrend continuing; if prices sustain below $4050, we can see a correction towards the previous low to around $3900. This week’s failed attempt to break above $4200 per ounce has created some short-term bearish sentiment.After reaching crucial resistance over $54, the market is experiencing fresh selling pressure, and silver has started a wild rollercoaster ride. Silver has recovered all of its losses from last month’s severe selloff, which saw prices plummet 16% in only two weeks, over the past seven sessions. Despite the important double top that silver’s price action has formed, market sentiment is still largely bullish. For me to go firmly negative, silver must at least break and close below $50. The neckline must break around $47 for a double top to be confirmed, setting a target of $44. However, a run-up towards $56 may occur if prices defy gravity and surpass $53.50.

(Reuters) Exceeding most exit poll predictions, the NDA stormed back to power in the Bihar assembly election with a commanding mandate of 202 seats, far higher than 122 it won in the previous election. The recently launched women-centric cash transfer scheme played a major role in improving the voter turnout – especially among women, which reflected in the results as well. The Nitish Kumar-led JDU was a clear winner, snatching 40+ seats from the RJD, while the BJP (the single-largest party in terms of seats won) gained at the cost of the Congress (-13 seats). Although the results of the Bihar election send a clear signal of the political appeal of the BJP and its allies, we believe the JDU with 85 seats is currently in a commanding position at the Centre.

Title: Bitcoin fear hits 2025 lows – Yet institutions scoop up $24B: What gives?

The sell-off may be the tail-end of a six-month stealth bear phase. Because the Fear & Greed Index has dropped to 10, its lowest reading of 2025. ETFs added $24 billion this year, even as retail panic triggered $19B in liquidations. Bitcoin [BTC] sentiment has dropped to its lowest level of 2025, but the market isn’t breaking the way many fear. Retail traders are panicking, yet long-term signs remain steady while institutions continue to buy through ETFs. Experts are now saying this sell-off could be the final stretch of a six-month quiet bear phase. Will the market recover? Recent data from Alphractal showed the Crypto Fear & Greed Index falling to 10 at press time. This is the lowest sentiment reading of 2025. Source: Alphractal Such extreme fear has appeared only during market resets or the tail end of prolonged drawdowns. The index has now fallen from the mid-60s to near-zero territory within weeks, similar to the unwinding seen during mid-2021 and mid-2022. Source: Alphractal On top of that, the broader Alpha Crypto Sentiment Gauge shifted from neutral-bullish earlier this quarter to bearish and very bearish signals. That shift kept traders focused on possible capitulation zones. Over $19 billion in liquidations and 1.6 million wiped-out traders created the perfect setup for large players to absorb supply at lower prices. Long-term holders reportedly released 62,000 BTC since October, much of it flowing into ETFs managed by firms like BlackRock and Fidelity. Despite panic-driven selling, ETF balances have grown by $24 billion in 2025. This correction may be a structural transfer rather than a cycle top. Building on the narrative, Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley noted in an X post that crypto may already be deep into a six-month bear phase. He argued that the traditional four-year cycle model no longer applied to a market shaped by ETF flows, regulation, and heavyweight institutions. Source: X By contrast, post-ETF dynamics introduced new mechanical buy-and-sell patterns that influenced volatility. Despite the recent drop, Horsley maintained that underlying conditions could support one of the strongest recovery environments yet.

Title: AIL wrap: Terenure coach hails ‘courage and guts’ as derby win nudges them closer to top

Carlos Spencer hailed the character of his team after Terenure moved to within a point of Energia All-Ireland League leaders St Mary’s with a gritty 14-12 win to end their neighbours’ unbeaten record. On a sodden Lakelands Park pitch, which nonetheless held up well, this full-on D6W derby captivated a crowd of about 4,000 from its first minute to a thunderous climax. The prolific Mick O’Gara opened the scoring before Terenure struck through John McKee’s close-range finish after a sweeping move released Caolan Dooley to link with the supporting Griffin Culver. O’Gara then landed three more penalties to inch St Mary’s 12-7 in front before they withheld a siege on the line inside the last 10 minutes. However, Terenure’s furious kick-chase and counter-ruck earned another onslaught from which flanker Oisín McCormack burrowed over and Chris Cosgrave landed another fine conversion. Cue a wave of attacks from distance by St Mary’s, with Conor Dean puling the strings, which led to a 52-metre penalty by O‘Gara with the last kick which had the legs but drifted wide. “It’s a shame that the weather didn’t play its part and give us a nice day. We could probably have played a bit more rugby,” said Spencer. “So, we had to tidy things up a bit and sometimes it became a bit of a scrap. “We missed out on a couple of opportunities and our discipline let us down, but we stayed in the fight and grafted to show true character. I’m very proud of that and when we got our opportunity we took it. We didn’t give in, which was good.” His counterpart, Mark McHugh, expressed similar sentiments. “A typical derby, no quarter given and none asked. We could have nicked it at the end, justly or unjustly I don’t know, but they are a really good team. “They’re going to be there or thereabouts at the end and I really hope we will be as well. Disappointed to lose, but equally delighted with the fight we showed and the courage and the guts, because they are attributes you can’t coach.” Champions Clontarf moved alongside Terenure on 23 points by beating Cork Con 17-3 at Temple Hill in a repeat of last year’s final. Lansdowne are fourth on 20 points after a 36-11 win over neighbours Old Belvedere at Ollie Campbell Park. Max Deegan stole line-outs and imposed himself, as did Charlie Tector. Ballynahinch are fifth, a point further back, after their 24-3 bonus-point win at Nenagh Ormond, while UCD moved out of the bottom two after a handsome bonus-point win over Young Munster. Curiously, the top two entering round six met in each of the top four divisions. Old Wesley remain first in 1B after a 30-16 win at home to Trinity, as do unbeaten Barnhall in 2A after a 28-10 win at Dungannon. The same goes for unbeaten Galwegians after their seven-try 43-21 win away to UL Bohemians. The same match-up took place in the women’s division on the UL 4G, where champions UL Bohs moved above a dogged Galwegians with a 36-24 win.

Title: Firm friends: Finola Kennedy on a remarkable friendship between the founder of the Legion of Mary and former president WT Cosgrave

A remarkable friendship existed between Frank Duff, the founder of the Legion of Mary, and WT Cosgrave who died 60 years ago on November 16th, 1965. Many tributes followed Cosgrave’s death, including an impressive one from then taoiseach Seán Lemass. Understandably the tributes focused on his public life. But there were other, less well known strands. Among these was Cosgrave’s support for the lay Catholic organisation founded by Duff in 1921, and which today numbers four million active members worldwide. Following school in Blackrock College, Duff entered the Civil Service in the Land Commission where he made a significant contribution to the 1923 Land Act before transferring to the Department of Finance. He identified closely with the Civil Service ethos. In a letter written to Seán Ó Faoláin in August 1944, Duff would write, “My cast of mind is mechanical rather than literary. I was a civil servant.” On Saturday July 15th, 1922, in the middle of the Civil War when ministers and officials were living in Government Buildings in Upper Merrion Street, Duff, accompanied by Father Michael Creedon, a priest in Francis Street parish, obtained an interview with WT Cosgrave, then minister for local government and soon to be president. EP McCarron, secretary of the department of local government, was also present and probably facilitated the meeting. Duff and Fr Creedon were seeking accommodation for homeless women whose alternative was prostitution. The Monto area of Dublin, named after Montgomery Street, since named Foley Street, was such a thriving centre for prostitution and for late-night drinking in shebeens that it merited a mention in the Encyclopaedia Britannica in 1903. Cosgrave recalled how “Frank and Fr Creedon came to the ante-chamber of the cabinet room while a meeting was in progress – asking to see me. It was then he told me of efforts of Fr Creedon and himself on behalf of these friendless girls”. Cosgrave listened intently and asked them to come back in the morning for his response. On the following morning, Sunday, Duff and Creedon called to Government Buildings where they were given a letter. The letter, in Cosgrave’s handwriting, informed them that premises at 76 Harcourt Street had been placed at their disposal free of rent and taxes. A previous owner of the house was the builder, Batt O’Connor, a close friend of Michael Collins. You have won the deep respect of all and you have made Ireland respected everywhere. Personally I could not possibly express the extent of my regard for you and for your work In 1926 at a time of great poverty and dire housing conditions in Dublin, Mr Cosgrave’s government made available to Duff the premises of the North Dublin Union for use as a hostel for homeless men. The Morning Star, as the hostel was named, was officially opened in the presence of a small number of guests, including president Cosgrave, on March 25th, 1927. In October 1930, the Regina Coeli, a hostel for homeless women and their children, opened beside the Morning Star. Both hostels, which have remained open without interruption since 1927 and 1930 respectively, are served by voluntary workers who are members of the Legion of Mary. In 1930 when Duff had still failed to obtain a meeting with the Archbishop of Dublin, Archbishop Byrne, regarding recognition for the legion, Duff again approached Cosgrave. On this occasion Cosgrave, recognising difficulties with the archdiocese, arranged a meeting with the papal nuncio, Paschal Robinson, who had arrived in Ireland on January 14th, 1930. A handwritten letter – undated, but clearly written shortly after Robinson arrived in Ireland – from Paul Banim, the president’s secretary, to Duff, said: “You are to be in room 58 Shelbourne Hotel at 5 o’clock sharp. The President has made the appointment you sought. Ring me.” At the time the Nunciature in the Phoenix Park was undergoing renovations and Robinson was staying in the Shelbourne. In the year following the Shelbourne meeting, Cosgrave accompanied Duff to the Nunciature on May 7th, 1931, when a proposed Roman trip was discussed. Two weeks later on May 23rd, Duff, accompanied by Monsignor O’Brien from Liverpool, travelled to Rome. In Rome Duff was received in audience by Pope Pius XI, who said that he wished the legion would spread over the world. Thanks to Cosgrave, Duff was received by the pope many years before he was received by his own archbishop in Dublin. [ Flying columnist – Frank McNally on a lightning visit to LeesideOpens in new window ] Duff never forgot his debt to Cosgrave. When Cosgrave’s government was replaced in 1932, he wrote to Cosgrave, “You have won the deep respect of all and you have made Ireland respected everywhere. Personally I could not possibly express the extent of my regard for you and for your work.” According to his son Liam Cosgrave, “The last letter that WT wrote was to Frank Duff the actual day he got his final attack 15th November 1965. He died on 16th.” At the time Duff was in Rome for the Vatican Council. A Requiem Mass was held in Rome, at which the government was represented by then minister for agriculture and fisheries, Charles Haughey. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Paddy McCarthy delighted after vindicating Farrell’s decision to select him against Australia

A first Test in Chicago against the All Blacks, a first Test try a week later against Japan and a first Test start against Australia. Paddy McCarthy has arrived as an Irish international and how. On Saturday night he utterly vindicated the faith placed in him by Andy Farrell and the Irish coaches with a 47-minute showing which all his coaches and team-mates through the ranks had long since envisaged. First and foremost McCarthy – immovable while staying square – had the upper hand on his side of the scrum against Allan Alaalatoa, which was the platform for two of Ireland’s first three tries. He put in a shift defensively with nine tackles, while giving a glimpse of his bull-like carries. “Yeah I was happy,” he said afterwards. “Scrum was good. There were mistakes there that I need to brush up on, but happy enough as it’s international rugby and it’s not going to go perfectly. Happy with how I’m going and thankfully I’m not injured or anything, that’s always good.” Yet again, another Farrell fast-tracking hunch is working out. As with older brother Joe, whom the coach blooded at the age of 21 in the November clash with Australia three years ago, the Ireland coach recognises their raw power. “My brother was telling me there’s very few times where you get a packed-out Aviva, there’s not many moments that it comes around. Even if you have a long career, it’s still very special every time you’re playing in the Aviva.” Talking about his brother’s influence, the young McCarthy said: “He’s massive. Equally, when I’m out and he’s in, I’ll help him in any way I can. We’re great friends, he’s my best friend. It’s nice. “I can’t believe I was playing Australia today. I went over to Australia and I remember watching the first Test and having a pint, just like in a Lions jersey, watching it. I can’t believe playing a guy like James O’Connor, all those guys. There’s some great players in the Australian team so it’s kind of surreal, to be honest. It was cool.” Not out of character, it has to be said, there was also one daft penalty for needless use of a hand on the deck in a ruck under the nose of referee Karl Dickson. Oh Paddy. But it’s the McCarthy edge which Farrell also likes, citing how he left an indelible impression on him when he was part of the under-20s squad which the team trained against three seasons ago and seemingly caused all sorts of carnage. “Some of it’s probably true, some of it’s not that true,” he said with a sheepish grin. “I don’t know. It was funny. I was probably a bit of an idiot in the Under 20s anyway. I was really revved up. I probably toned things down a little bit as I got into the senior environment, just chilled out in a good way. Obviously, still adding to the game, but just focusing on my role a bit more. “It was cool training against the senior squad. It was kind of funny. Obviously, I idolised Johnny [Sexton]. I thought I was being friendly, but I think he took it as me being cheeky or something. He kind of fecked me out a bit, but he was grand. It was cool,” said McCarthy. For all the hope through his Blackrock, Trinity and Irish Under-20s days, McCarthy still hadn’t made a start for Leinster until this season and despite being in the squad, missed out on a first cap against either Georgia or Portugal. He didn’t envisage this. “I wasn’t sure if I’d be playing for Ireland or not. I know when the squad came out, I thought I was in the A squad. When the message came in, it was ‘ANS squad’. I didn’t know it was ‘Autumn Nations’, I thought it was A squad or A national squad,” he revealed. “I was like, I’ll just take what I get and play as much as possible. But I was happy out. I was very happy that the coaches, Fogs, Pauly and Faz, put a lot of confidence in me when I came in; more than I expected. “I didn’t think I would get a start in this window because in the summer, I didn’t even play in the Ireland squad. So, to actually get a start and being told I was going well, in the scrums and things like that, it was nice.” A fourth cap against the Springboks would top off a slightly surreal month, but he remains humble. “Yeah, I’d love that. There is good competition and unfortunately Jack Boyle hasn’t got a run out yet and we’re still young and both learning. I’ll take what I can get and if I get to play again, I’d love it. If not, whatever, I’ll do it with the squad.” Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date What’s making headlines in the rugby world?

Title: Australia net zero target: Energy companies warn sidelining renewables will raise power bills

We’re sorry, this feature is currently unavailable. We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. Add articles to your saved list and come back to them any time. Australia’s biggest energy companies have reinforced their support for the government’s 2050 net zero target and warned that failing to embrace renewables will only send power bills higher, contradicting a key Coalition argument as it fights to wind back climate action. Liberal leader Sussan Ley, who formally ditched the Coalition’s support for net zero on Sunday, has revived claims that renewable energy and emissions targets will impose unaffordable costs on households. Most of Australia’s remaining coal-fired power plants are due to close within the next 10 years as they face frequent equipment faults, soaring maintenance costs and intense competition from renewables.Credit: Paul Jones If elected, the Coalition would also dismantle Labor’s interim climate targets, abolish electric vehicle incentives and extend taxpayer funds to keep coal-fired power stations running longer or support the construction of new ones, she said. But in a report to be released on Monday, the chief executives of more than a dozen major electricity suppliers, including AGL, Origin Energy and EnergyAustralia, who are all members of the Australian Energy Council, rejected calls to ditch net zero and insisted that shifting to a mostly renewable grid was the best way to keep bills as low as possible. The chief executives emphasised the need for “policy certainty and stability” as Australia neared a critical juncture in the energy transition. While coal-fired power stations still supply more than half of the nation’s electricity needs, most of them are approaching the end of their usable lives and are due to be retired before 2035, meaning they must be urgently replaced regardless of net zero ambitions, they said. ‘In the long run, this approach [renewables] will still be cheaper than continuing to invest in existing or new coal-fired power generation.’ In 2022, AGL brought forward the closure of its Bayswater coal plant in NSW to no later than 2033, while the retirement of the Loy Yang A generator in Victoria was fast-tracked by up to 10 years to 2035. Origin Energy originally intended to retire Eraring, the nation’s largest coal plant, in 2032, but now plans to shut it in 2027. The anti-net zero bloc: Jessica Collins, Angus Taylor, Sarah Henderson, Andrew Hastie and Jacinta Nampijinpa Price arrive with other Liberals for their party room showdown on Wednesday.Credit: Alex Ellinghausen The industry argues the cheapest path for consumers is to invest in replacing ageing coal generators with firmed-up renewable energy, rather than forcing the extensions of ageing and increasingly unreliable plants, which can break down with no notice and cause huge price rises, or building new coal-fired facilities. “The least-cost, lowest-impact pathway is an energy system dominated by renewables and firmed by battery storage, gas and pumped hydro,” the chief executives said. However, the Australian Energy Council stresses that replacing ageing power stations is “not costless”, and will push up people’s electricity bills – at least for a while. Building more wind and solar farms, large-scale storage projects and thousands of kilometres of extra pylons and power lines to stitch together a bigger and more complex grid will all add to costs that need to be passed on to consumers, it said. The report noted that electricity prices had “never been under more pressure” due to heavy investments needed to replace and decarbonise ageing generation assets. It called for a more open and honest dialogue about what the energy transition would cost homes and businesses. “I think it’s the calm before the storm,” one chief executive said. In particular, network costs to maintain and upgrade transmission infrastructure, which account for about a third of a customer’s bill, are expected to increase significantly in the coming years. The CSIRO calculates that a new coal-fired power plant, using modern technology to keep emissions down as much as possible, would produce electricity for between $111 and $178 a megawatt hour – at a midpoint of $145. Power from renewables in a mostly renewable grid, meanwhile, would cost between $116 and $165 a megawatt hour (a midpoint of $141), which also factors in the billions of dollars in additional costs such as paying for batteries, gas and transmission lines. Once built and operating, renewables were among the lowest-cost sources of energy, Australian Energy Council chief executive Louisa Kinnear said. “But we still need to account for the costs of constructing new supply and adopting our existing system to accommodate and firm up low emissions, intermittent sources,” she said. “In the long run, this approach will still be cheaper than continuing to invest in existing or new coal-fired power generation, but we need to ensure the transition is managed carefully.” The push to scrap the commitment to net zero by 2050 and weaken interim climate targets would breach the conditions of the Paris Agreement, which Australia signed up to in 2016. Large investors, who have been pouring billions of dollars into green energy projects across Australia, described the Coalition’s backdown as “material and disappointing”. “However, the fundamentals remain,” said Clean Energy Investor Group chief executive Richie Merzian, who represents funds including US-based BlackRock, France’s Neoen and Australia’s Macquarie Bank. “New generation is required, clean energy is the best path for returns, and the current government is committed to supporting that.” Debby Blakey, chief executive of the $100 billion superannuation giant HESTA, which invests heavily in the energy transition, said bipartisan support for climate targets including net zero was important for investors to know that policies would remain stable. “This is critical given investors commit capital over very long time frames for investments like energy infrastructure,” she said. “Attracting global private capital to invest in Australia’s transition is underpinned by long-term policy certainty.” The Business Briefing newsletter delivers major stories, exclusive coverage and expert opinion.

Title: Sublease crisis winding down in latest sign of NYC office recovery

The wind’s gone out of the great sublease balloon that supposedly spelled doom for the city’s office market. Manhattan office sublease availability has fallen to less than in 2019, according to Transwestern — down to just 11.8 million square feet in the third quarter, compared to 12.3 million before the start of the pandemic and a high of 23 million in early 2023. But wait — wasn’t the sublease “glut” going to wreck the progress that was made since COVID-19 ravaged the economy? CoStar News in April 2023 cited a Savills warning that, “Companies putting spaces up for sublease reached an all-time high of 22.4 million square feet in the first quarter,” or 24.6% of all Manhattan office availability at the time. An even gloomier essay posted on The City in May 2023 described Big Apple office market “deterioration” due to “scores” of empty buildings, high interest rates, $16 billion in outstanding debt, sublease volume, and the usual bogeyman of work-from-home. Now, however, Transwestern reports that sublease offerings have fallen to 18% of Manhattan availability. Most spaces still up for grabs were smaller than 25,000 square feet, although a few large blocks remained. “We’ve been keeping an eye on the sublease levels for a few years now, first as they ballooned during the height of the pandemic, and with optimistic expectation as they slowly subsided over the past few quarters,” said Transwestern research manager Corrie Slewett. “It’s a notable milestone that Manhattan’s available sublet space has settled below the pre-pandemic levels,” Slewett added. Recent, large sublease deflations included Paramount Global, which last month yanked 92,5000 square feet from availability at 1515 Broadway. Large absorption deals included Blackrock’s 193,000 square feet from Meta at 50 Hudson Yards; Robinhood’s 125,400 square-foot sublease from MSG at 2 Penn; and Sixth Street Partners’ 103,400 square feet from Pfizer at The Spiral. CBRE global brokerage head Stephen B. Siegel commented, “The market is on fire and the absorption of sublease space is a natural by-product of that. The reduction is attributable both to tenants expanding and others deciding to keep space they previously planned to give up.”

Title: Harvard’s Bitcoin Bag Swells: Spot BTC ETF Holdings Climb 257% In Q3

Bitcoin has enjoyed attention as one of the most rewarding stores of value in recent years, with institutional adoption reaching new highs this year. One such landmark Bitcoin acquisition was made by Harvard University, arguably the world’s most prestigious academic institution. Earlier in August, Harvard disclosed an investment portfolio containing $117 million worth of shares in BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) as of the end of Q2. According to its latest disclosure, the university’s BTC exposure nearly tripled over the last quarter. In its latest 13F filing, Harvard University revealed that it held 6,813,612 shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) valued at approximately $443 million as of September 30. This additional acquisition highlights the institution’s expansive capital allocation strategy, which also saw its SPDR Gold Trust (GLD) holdings grow to 661,391 shares (worth approximately $235 million) in 2025 Q3. Notably, Harvard’s current holding of the leading spot BTC ETF represents a 257% increase from the disclosed 1,906,000 shares declared as of June. As of now, BlackRock’s exchange-traded fund is the single largest investment of the university’s reported holdings. While the current IBIT position makes only a small portion of Harvard’s endowment of $57 billion, it is significant enough to make the university the 16th-largest IBIT holder. As inferred earlier, stories of institutional adoption such as this further add credence to Bitcoin’s status as a strategic reserve asset and the growing demand for exchange-traded funds. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas wrote on X: It’s super rare/difficult to get an endowment to bite on an ETF- esp a Harvard or Yale, it’s as good a validation as an ETF can get. That said, half a billion is a mere 1% of total endowment. Big enough to rank 16th among IBIT holders tho. The US-based Bitcoin ETFs have suffered waning investor demand in recent weeks, with the past week particularly disappointing. According to the latest market data, the exchange-traded funds registered a total net outflow of $1.1 billion in the past week. Leading these withdrawals was BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust, which is currently on a three-day outflow streak. Data from SoSoValue shows that $463.1 million flowed out of the BTC ETF on Friday, November 14. As of this writing, BlackRock’s IBIT still ranks as the largest spot Bitcoin ETF, with net assets worth roughly $74.98 billion. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

A JUDGE HAS stated it will be alleged that a former sales associate with high end retail brands in Dublin “was caught red handed” with two suitcases containing €620,000 worth of cannabis by the carousel at Shannon airport last week. At Ennis District Court, Judge Alec Gabbett made his comment in the case where Sean Grehan (28) of Stradbrook Park, Blackrock, Dublin appeared in court after being charged with two alleged drugs offences arising from the airport seizure last Wednesday. At the conclusion of a contested bail hearing, Judge Gabbett remanded Grehan in custody with consent to bail on condition that Grehan provide a €20,000 cash surety. Counsel for Grehan, Sorcha Dianamh Ní Néill Fulham BL, told Judge Gabbett that her client “doesn’t have cash at present”. Gardaí objected to bail and Garda Kevin Molloy said that it will be alleged that a passenger from an inbound Boston flight, Sean Grehan, was detected by customs officers to have two 20kg suitcases at Shannon airport last Wednesday containing 31kg of cannabis with an estimated street value of €620,000. Garda Molloy said that it will be alleged that Grehan was due to pass the two suitcases to another person after getting through customs at Shannon airport. Garda Molloy said that gardaí were objecting to bail based on the seriousness of the charge and the strength of evidence against Mr Grehan in the case. Advertisement Garda Molloy said that Grehan by his own admission has incurred a significant drugs debt due to his addiction to cocaine “and admitted that he has taken a serious amount of cocaine over the last number of years”. Garda Molloy said that the suspected cannabis is to be tested at the Forensic Science Ireland (FSI). Judge Gabbett said that it will be alleged that Grehan “was caught red handed at the carousel at Shannon airport with two suit-cases full of drugs”. In response, Ms Ní Néill Fulham said that this would be a matter for evidence. Ms Ní Néill Fulham said that her client is a father of two children, aged seven and five, and has worked as a sales associate for a number of high end retail brands in Dublin. Ms Ní Néill Fulham expressed concern that if Grehan was to be remanded in custody the length of time it is taking FSI to test for drugs currently. In the case, Grehan is charged with at Shannon airport on November 12th having in his possession, cannabis for the purpose of sale or supply contrary to Section 15 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977. Grehan is also charged with having in his possession cannabis on November 12th at Shannon airport contrary to Section 3 of the Misuse of Drugs Act. Judge Gabbett remanded Grehan in custody with consent to bail to appear before Ennis District Court via video link on Wednesday.

Title: Harvard University boosts its BlackRock Bitcoin ETF investment to $442.8m

About us Copy link The Ivy League has given Bitcoin exchange-traded funds another seal of approval, with Harvard University bolstering the size of its holdings by almost 260%. That’s according to disclosures in a Harvard Management Company filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. The Harvard Management Company, launched in 1974, manages Harvard University’s endowment and other financial assets, making stock market investments on the university’s behalf. The filing shows that, as of its latest filing, the company’s holdings in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust, or IBIT, were worth $442.8 million. As of September 30, Harvard University owned 6.81 million IBIT shares. The university’s financial managers made their first IBIT investment in the second quarter of FY2025, taking up a $116.7 million position in the BlackRock-run Bitcoin ETF. In August, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst noted that “endowments are the hardest institution to hook,” as “they rarely bite on ETFs.” This trend appears to have been turned on its head. The dollar value of Harvard’s BTC ETF investment dwarfs the combined total of its holdings in the blue-chip tech stocks Meta, NVIDIA, and the Google operator Alphabet. The filing also shows that IBIT is Harvard’s biggest ETF purchase, and its largest single investment in terms of dollar worth. And Harvard is not the only member of the Ivy League buying up Bitcoin ETF shares. SEC data shows that Brown University owns 212,500 IBIT shares, worth $13,007,125 when it filed with the SEC on August 8. The Harvard filing, meanwhile, also shows that the university’s fund managers are turning to gold. They have snapped up 661,391 shares in the gold ETF SPDR Gold Shares. Harvard’s holdings in gold shares are worth $235 million. The rest of Harvard’s portfolio is primarily made up of tech stocks. The university holds significant positions in firms like Microsoft, as well as the chipmakers Taiwan Semiconductor and Broadcom. It also holds stocks in the gambling giants Light & Wonder and Flutter Entertainment. Pension funds across the United States have begun buying Bitcoin ETF shares in recent years. But sell-offs have also become increasingly common. Earlier this year, Wisconsin’s Investment Board sold the entirety of its $300 million holdings in the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF. This month has also seen some investors liquidate their holdings. On November 8, the CryptoQuant analyst Maartunn noted that Bitcoin ETF flows have “dropped by about $2.3 billion from their peak.” This marks the “largest outflow since May 2025,” he added. May saw investors withdraw a total of $4.8 billion from Bitcoin ETFs. Tim Alper is a news correspondent at DL News. Got a tip? Email at tdalper@dlnews.com.

Title: How much is $10k invested in BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF at launch worth today?

By Sept. 30, that same $10,000 IBIT position had reached approximately $25,000, translating to a 150% return in under two years. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. A $10,000 wager on BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) at launch would be worth $19,870 today, nearly double the return of the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100, and edging past gold’s own stellar run. However, that 98.7% gain masks the bigger picture that, for several months in 2025, IBIT holders were sitting on returns exceeding 150%, watching their initial stake balloon past $25,000 before Bitcoin’s recent stumble below six figures pulled those gains back to earth. The comparison isn’t close when measured over the 22-month window since IBIT’s Jan. 5, 2024, inception. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 both delivered respectable returns of 42-43%, an impressive feat given that they posted back-to-back years of 25% or more, a rarity that has occurred only three times since 1871. Gold, driven by geopolitical anxiety and central bank buying, came closest with gains of 92-93%. Yet Bitcoin’s trajectory carved a different path entirely, one defined less by steady compounding than by violent swings that rewarded conviction and punished hesitation. By Sept. 30, that same $10,000 IBIT position had reached approximately $25,000, translating to a 150% return in under two years, according to a BlackRock filing with the SEC. Bitcoin traded near $115,000 per coin by then, IBIT shares hovered around that level, and the narrative shifted from “institutional adoption” to “how high can this go?” The 2.5x milestone represented not just arithmetic success but psychological vindication for allocators who endured skepticism about crypto’s place in portfolios governed by Sharpe ratios and correlation matrices. Then came October, and Bitcoin registered a new all-time high above $126,000, with IBIT shares priced at $71,29, before sliding through its short-term holder cost basis. The movement triggered cascading liquidations across futures markets, and the leverage that amplified the climb accelerated the descent. As of press time, Bitcoin traded at $96,612.79, and IBIT traded at $54.84, making those September highs look like a mirage. The drawdown from peak erased roughly $6,000 in paper value per initial $10,000 invested, a reminder that Bitcoin’s uncorrelated returns cut both ways. The equity indices delivered a textbook performance: the S&P 500 achieved its third consecutive year of double-digit gains, and the Nasdaq 100, propelled by the “Magnificent Seven,” saw earnings growth averaging 21.6% year-over-year. Both suffered manageable drawdowns, traded within established ranges, and validated decades of mean-reversion research. Gold’s 52% year-to-date surge through November 2025 stemmed from macroeconomic dislocation, fueled by tariff uncertainty, Fed pause dynamics, and record central bank purchases, rather than speculative mania. Its correlation to equities stayed negative, fulfilling its portfolio role as designed. IBIT offered none of that predictability, with a 98.7% gain since inception deriving from a single-asset bet on a protocol with no earnings, no dividends, and no intrinsic cash flow to discount. The volatility that allowed a 150% peak also permitted a 25% collapse in weeks. Traditional risk models would categorize that profile as unacceptable, and traditional risk-adjusted returns would penalize the path even as they acknowledged the destination. Yet, the path matters less than the outcome for capital deployed at inception. The investor who bought IBIT on day one and held through the September peak, the November pullback, and every subsequent liquidation cascade still outperformed every major benchmark by a margin wide enough to survive transaction costs, tax drag, and multiple moments of doubt. That investor also experienced standard deviation in returns that would make compliance officers flinch and risk committees demand explanations. IBIT’s performance doesn’t just reflect Bitcoin’s price appreciation, it captures the infrastructure that’s been built around crypto as an asset class instead. Spot ETF approval removed custody risk for institutions allergic to private keys and hardware wallets. BlackRock’s brand provided regulatory air cover. The CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate gave auditors a benchmark they could defend. Together, these developments transformed Bitcoin from “digital gold held by ideologues” into “trackable exposure tradeable through Schwab.” That wrapper mattered when Bitcoin tested six figures. ETF inflows of $1.2 billion exiting in November didn’t represent panic, but rather rebalancing, profit-taking, and tactical repositioning by allocators who could now treat Bitcoin like any other liquid asset. The same pipes that channeled $37 billion into IBIT over its first year also allowed nearly $900 million to exit on a single day on Nov. 13, without breaking the market. Liquidity is the tax that professionals pay for access, and IBIT’s structure efficiently collects that tax. The futures markets told the rest of the story. Open interest swelled to $235 billion by mid-October before contracting as long positions unwound. Funding rates remained subdued even as prices tested support, indicating that traders had de-risked rather than doubled down. Options skew favored puts by 11% in implied volatility, pricing protection against sub-$100K tests that arrived on schedule. The infrastructure didn’t prevent volatility. It simply made volatility tradeable, insurable, and therefore tolerable for capital that demands both. Comparing IBIT to the S&P 500 or Nasdaq 100 assumes they’re solving for the same mandate, which they’re not. Equity indices provide exposure to aggregate corporate earnings growth, diversified across sectors, with governance structures and disclosure requirements that mitigate downside risk. IBIT offers exposure to a fixed-supply monetary protocol with no recourse, no management team to fire, and no quarterly guidance to parse. The former compounds through dividend reinvestment and multiple expansion, while the latter compounds through network effects and adoption curves that either validate the thesis or don’t. Gold sits closer to the spectrum, with no cash flows, no earnings, valued for its scarcity and institutional acceptance. However, gold’s 5,000-year history as a store of value gives it mean-reversion characteristics that Bitcoin lacks. When gold rallies by 50% in a year, the assumption is that it will revert to its long-term average. When Bitcoin rallies 150%, the assumption is either a paradigm shift or speculative excess, with no consensus on which. That uncertainty is the premium IBIT investors pay for asymmetry. The 98.7% return since inception, the peak in October, and the 25% drawdown since all reflect the fact that Bitcoin’s volatility is an inherent asset characteristic, not a bug to engineer away. The institutions that purchased IBIT were aware of this. The 19-month outperformance against traditional benchmarks compensated them for enduring it. Whether that trade continues to work depends less on Fed policy or ETF flows than on whether enough capital decides that the volatility is worth the option value embedded in a non-sovereign, programmatically scarce bearer asset. For the investor who placed $10,000 into IBIT at launch and now holds $19,870, the answer is already clear. For the one who sold at nearly $25,000 in September, the answer is more precise still. And for the allocator still running Monte Carlo simulations on the role of crypto in a 60/40 portfolio, the question remains open. And this is exactly why the returns appear as they do.

More than one-third of Americans do not own stocks, and a new BlackRock survey reveals that the holdouts cite a lot of reasons for not being in the market. In its People & Money report published on Thursday, BlackRock listed some of the reasons people who don't invest say they stay on the sidelines. Among the most common are not having enough money, not feeling like they know enough about investing, and being afraid of losses. Those are all fair explanations for not putting your money to work. But there is one simple piece of advice from investing icon Warren Buffett that offers a solution to each one of them: invest in an S&P 500 index fund, a product that tracks the performance of roughly the 500 largest stocks in the US. "Over the years, I've often been asked for investment advice, and in the process of answering I've learned a good deal about human behavior," Buffett said in his 2017 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders. "My regular recommendation has been a low-cost S&P 500 index fund." So, let's go through each of the above reasons, starting with the toughest: not having enough money. If you've never done it, investing is something that can feel like you need thousands of dollars saved up to start. In reality, there are some very low-cost entry points. For example, the Schwab S&P 500 Index Fund (SWPPX) trades at around $17 a share. You can also buy fractional shares of funds that trade at a higher price level, but it's more or less all the same in the end. While investing small amounts may seem futile, it's more about getting started and building habits — after a few years, if you keep at it, you'll have built up a chunk of money thanks to both your contributions and compounding returns. Second: not feeling like you know enough about investing. Financial markets can feel daunting, but like anything, once you do it, it gets easier. Plus, the beauty about buying an index fund is that you don't really need to know much about investing. Your money will passively sit in a diversified group of stocks for years. If you really feel that you have questions that need to be addressed, however, you can always visit a physical branch of an advisor like Charles Schwab or Fidelity, said Chris Chen, a certified financial planner and founder of Insight Financial Strategists. "They have people at the counter there who are waiting for them to invest their money and answer their questions, and they're basically free," Chen told Business Insider. Finally: being afraid that you'll lose money. It's what keeps even the most successful investors up at night. But the reality is that, if you have a long-term time horizon and resist the urge to sell at the first sign of trouble, the S&P 500 has historically recovered from its pullbacks. Earlier this year, Yale economist William Goetzmann told Business Insider that investors tend to overestimate the odds of an imminent stock market crash and tend to forget that such crashes don't last. Goetzmann's research shows that when the market plunges after a big period of returns, there's a 99% chance those losses have been recovered five years later. "If you wait five years after this event, you're going to be better off. That's what I'm telling you," he said. Of course, S&P 500 index funds aren't the only products out there. Jason Draho, the head of asset allocation Americas for UBS Global Wealth Management, said that he would rather people invest in an all-world index fund — one example would be Vanguard Total World Stock ETF (VT) — as S&P 500 valuations are high and the index is heavily concentrated in a select few stocks. US stocks have outperformed the rest of the world over the last decade and a half. Since the March 2009 market lows, the Vanguard Total World Stock ETF is up 423% while the S&P 500 is up 800%. So far this year, however, the US has underperformed international stocks, and some Wall Street analysts see global markets beating the US in the coming years. There's also something to be said about the visibility of the S&P 500 — it's the benchmark that US investors tend to follow, and you can track its performance on the nightly news. But in the end, it doesn't matter all that much — it's more about getting the ball rolling. "The important part for someone who is just starting is to start," Chen said. Jump to
