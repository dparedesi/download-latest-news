By Arasu Kannagi Basil and Davide Barbuscia (Reuters) - BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s assets under management hit a record high for the third straight quarter as a U.S. stock market rally boosted inflows, while the world's largest asset manager continued a push to expand its footprint in private markets. Assets managed by BlackRock shot to $11.48 trillion in the period, compared with $9.10 trillion a year earlier and $10.65 trillion in the second quarter, the company said on Friday. That growth came as stocks reversed an August sell-off and broadened their rally in the third quarter, boosted by renewed hopes of a soft landing for the U.S. economy. BlackRock is expanding its offerings to become an all-in-one platform for investors by integrating public and private markets. "Our strategy is ambitious, and our strategy is working," Larry Fink, chairman and CEO, said in a statement. The company's shares were recently up 3.6% on Friday. They have advanced about 18% in 2024 as of last close, trailing the 21% jump in the S&P 500. Last week, the New York-based firm completed its $12.5 billion acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners, adding over $100 billion in assets to its kitty. Later this year, it is expected to close its $3.2 billion acquisition of private markets data provider Preqin. The two deals are expected to bolster BlackRock's presence in infrastructure investments and in private markets, both key areas of growth. "Growing public deficits are only going to expand the role of private markets in powering economic growth," Fink said in an earnings call on Friday. BlackRock registered $160 billion in long-term net inflows in the third quarter. Total net inflows hit a quarterly record of $221.18 billion, up from $2.57 billion a year ago. A majority of the long-term inflows were captured by ETFs, at $97.41 billion. Clients poured in $62.74 billion into BlackRock's fixed-income products. Asset managers have contended with softer inflows in recent years as interest rate hikes boosted the appeal of safe-haven assets like cash. But with interest rates expected to fall as the Federal Reserve continues a long-anticipated easing cycle it kicked off in September, some of that money could flow into assets such as fixed income products, a development Fink said could occur in a more “normalized” but "relatively high-rate environment.” Equity market benchmarks finished higher in the third quarter, with the S&P 500 gaining 5.4%, while the MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe rose 6.2%. BlackRock's net income rose to $1.63 billion, or $10.90 per share, in the three months ended Sept. 30, from $1.60 billion, or $10.66 per share, a year earlier. "The combination of a strong ETF franchise, an expansion into private markets, a favorable market tailwind, and contributions from acquisitions combined to widen the moat around BlackRock,” said Catherine Seifert, equity analyst at CFRA.

Title: IOG CEO: Cardano (ADA) ‘Wants To Be a Real Cryptocurrency and Not the Patron of BlackRock and Wall Street for Number Go Up Preferences’

Charles Hoskinson, co-creator of Cardano (ADA), addressed the recent shift in sentiment surrounding Cardano in a post on X on October 10. According to Hoskinson, the negative discourse is not indicative of failure but rather a consequence of the implementation of the Voltaire governance phase. He suggested that long-standing issues, such as unmet roadmap objectives, unfunded strategies, and partnerships that haven’t been formed, are coming to the forefront now that the ecosystem is transitioning to a more adaptive governance model under Voltaire. Hoskinson acknowledged that the ecosystem has not previously scaled to address the evolving needs of the community, but he expressed confidence that Voltaire’s governance framework is capable of addressing these concerns. He shared that he, too, has a lengthy list of unresolved issues that could not be tackled prior to this shift in governance. Specifically, Hoskinson mentioned that working with a Cardano Native Asset (CNA) — as part of the Midnight project — has made him acutely aware of challenges such as liquidity and asset custody. While he plans to continue contributing to these areas, he emphasized that the new on-chain governance model will also take on the responsibility of solving these issues. He referenced stablecoin support as another area where the governance structure will play a vital role in ensuring growth and security. Hoskinson contrasted Cardano’s open governance approach with other cryptocurrency projects, stating that Cardano’s commitment to transparency and public decision-making distinguishes it from others in the space. According to Hoskinson, while other projects may rely on opaque “backroom deals,” Cardano operates in a manner that is transparent to its global community, which spans over 100 countries. He stressed that the ecosystem’s governance is dedicated to long-term progress and integrity, standing in contrast to short-term market manipulation or companies seeking financial benefits. Hoskinson concluded by reinforcing that Cardano is not in decline but is instead thriving and growing. He asserted that Cardano remains dedicated to its goal of being a genuine cryptocurrency, as opposed to aligning with financial giants like BlackRock or catering to the preferences of Wall Street, whose focus he criticized as being driven solely by financial gain. You all may have noticed that the Twitter sentiment around Cardano has been more negative lately. This change isn't a reflection of our project somehow failing, but rather the desired result of Voltaire. There have been years of pent-up grievances, unexplored road map items,… On October 8, Cardano Ambassador Mauro Andreoli announced via the social media platform X that he and Lucas Macchia had successfully signed the first legally enforceable contract on the Cardano blockchain. The contract, compliant with Argentine law, marks a significant step toward the integration of blockchain technology into the legal realm. Andreoli emphasized that this agreement can be upheld in court, allowing any violations to be pursued legally, with obligations fulfilled in Cardano’s native cryptocurrency, ADA. The contract was a loan agreement between Andreoli and Macchia, valued at 10,000 ADA, with a four-month repayment term and a 10% interest rate. According to Andreoli, the transaction was notarized using a unique transaction ID, which is referenced in the legal documents attached to the agreement. Although Andreoli expressed excitement about this milestone, he mentioned that the full details of the contract remain private, as they include sensitive information such as his ID number, home address, and wallet information. Andreoli highlighted the importance of this event, calling it a major milestone for both the Cardano ecosystem and blockchain technology in Argentina. He believes that this legally enforceable smart contract paves the way for further use of blockchain in legal agreements, establishing legal precedents and simplifying future transactions. This development could potentially encourage the widespread adoption of blockchain-based agreements across various industries. He also discussed the adaptability of the framework, suggesting that the same structure could be applied to other types of contracts, such as real estate leases, purchase agreements, and other business transactions requiring legal support. The existing legal framework in Argentina, combined with the flexibility of blockchain contracts, provides a solid foundation for future growth and development in the space. Andreoli further pointed out that this milestone doesn’t just benefit individuals but could also open doors for businesses in the Cardano ecosystem. He mentioned companies such as NMKR, EMURGO, Lago, and PALM Economy, which could use this development to establish legally sound operational frameworks, enhancing trust and credibility in blockchain-based business models.4o This structure and the associated benefits will also enable all companies within the Cardano ecosystem, such as @nmkr_io , @emurgo_io , @IagonOfficial , and @palmeconomy , to legally structure their businesses if they choose to do so. These organizations can leverage the results… pic.twitter.com/owH4yw6NAc The views and opinions expressed by the author, or any people mentioned in this article, are for informational purposes only, and they do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.

REUTERS/Carlo Allegri/File Photo BlackRock's assets under management hit a record high for the third straight quarter on Friday, helped by surging inflows to the company's exchange-traded funds and a searing equity rally that boosted the value of its clients' investments. Stock markets overcame the August selloff and broadened their rally in the third quarter, driven by renewed hopes of a soft landing for the world's largest economy after encouraging inflation data. The broader equity market benchmarks finished higher in the third quarter, with the S&P 500 gaining 5.4 per cent, while the MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe rose 6.2 per cent.

Asset managers have contended with softer inflows in recent years as rate hikes boosted the appeal of safe-haven assets like cash. Some investors also sat on the sidelines, waiting for more certainty on the interest-rate trajectory, before stepping back into riskier assets. But with the U.S. Federal Reserve finally kicking off its long-anticipated easing cycle, asset managers are poised to benefit as huge piles of cash on the sidelines move into riskier assets such as fixed-income products. BlackRock's net income rose to $1.63 billion, or $10.90 per share, in the three months ended September 30, from $1.60 billion, or $10.66 per share, a year earlier. Its shares have advanced about 18 per cent in 2024 as of last close, trailing the 21 per cent jump of the S&P 500.

Title: Cardano Hosts First Legally Enforceable Smart Contract In Argentina As Hoskinson Asserts ADA Isn’t Dying

The Cardano network has achieved a major feat by hosting its first legally enforceable smart contract signed in Argentina and under the jurisdiction of its courts. Input Output Global chief technology officer Romain Pellerin highlighted this historic feat in a recent post on X, stating: “Cardano paves the way of legally enforceable smart contracts in Argentina.” #Cardano paves the way of legally enforceable smart contracts in Argentina 🇦🇷Congrats @MauroAndreoliA et al. 🖖#web3 #lawonchain https://t.co/8Psfb1NRCe Cardano ambassador Mauro Andreoli recently announced to the Cardano community the signing of the first legally and judicially enforceable contract on the Cardano network, over which Argentina’s courts have jurisdiction. The contract is a loan agreement between Andreoli and Lucas Macchia for 10,000 Cardano (ADA) tokens — valued at around $3,380 — with four-month repayment at a 10% interest rate. The pair also signed a legal document outlining important details of the smart contract loan, including the blockchain and wallet used and the Transaction ID. Andreoli posited in an Oct. 8 X post that this marks the first time an Argentine court can implement full payment in the ADA cryptocurrency from a Cardano smart contract: “We did it, we have just signed the first legally and judicially enforceable contract on the Cardano network, in full compliance with the laws of the Argentine Republic.” Andreoli further noted that the milestone could encourage Argentine courts to recognize smart contracts more widely as a technology for streamlining commercial transactions. “Legally, this establishes evidence and streamlines procedural steps, marking the initial phase of creating favorable jurisprudence in the country and facilitating commercial transactions.” Cardano creator Charles Hoskinson has reiterated his conviction in the Cardano blockchain amid negative sentiment escalation. “Cardano isn’t dying. It’s thriving and growing. It’s also one of the last cryptocurrencies that still wants to be a real cryptocurrency and not the patron of Blackrock and Wall Street for number go up preferences,” Hoskinson wrote. In a long post on X, Hoskinson suggested the reason negative sentiment around Cardano has increased recently is not about Cardano “somehow failing” but “rather the desired result of Voltaire.” The Cardano network transitioned to the Age of Voltaire on Sept. 1. He explained the reason for this: “There have been years of pent-up grievances, unexplored road map items, unfunded growth strategies, and needed partnerships that haven’t been addressed due to Cardano’s governance not scaling to meet the needs of the ecosystem.”

Cardano’s Co-founder, Charles Hoskinson, has taken it upon himself to address the upsurge in negative sentiments surrounding the Cardano ecosystem. Hoskinson highlighted a continuing trend of conversations amongst X users leaning towards a bearish position but insisted that it does not encapsulate the actual state of the Cardano network. “You all may have noticed that the Twitter sentiment around Cardano has been more negative lately. This change isn’t a reflection of our project somehow failing, but rather the desired result of Voltaire.” He wrote in a post shared on X. Like other blockchain networks, the Cardano network is no stranger to failed projects. In a report shared by AlphaQuest, Cardano topped the list on Dead Coins. Notably, 74% of projects on the network have become inactive, and as a result, Cardano has now emerged as one of the ten ecosystems with the most defunct coins. In his post, Hoskinson revealed that the development was associated with failing to scale Cardano’s governance to meet the ecosystem’s needs. Per his notations, the network has yet to explore several road map items, growth strategies, and partnerships necessary to drive growth. However, Hoskinson added that the presence of the Voltaire era, which is expected to bring about decentralization, is likely to turn things around. On September 1, 2024, Cardano completed the Chang Hard Fork, marking its official entrance into the highly anticipated Voltaire era. Another promising project is the Cardano Native Asset, which Hoskinson considers essential for the asset’s success. According to him, custody and liquidity are also essential. Hoskinson further emphasized the structure of Cardano, explaining that the network’s transparent landscape has played a major role in influencing public opinion. He went on to spotlight the role of the network’s on-chain government in its commitment to serving network users in over 100 countries. The Cardano boss stressed that “short-term thinking, market manipulation, and companies seeking a handout” have no place in the Cardano community. “Cardano isn’t dying. It’s thriving and growing. It’s also one of the last cryptocurrencies that still wants to be a real cryptocurrency and not the patron of Blackrock and Wall Street for number go-up preferences.” He asserted.

Title: China shares tumble as markets await stimulus news—and Tesla takes a hit

Shares in mainland China tumbled as U.S. inflation data clouded hopes for another Fed rate cut and traders awaited Beijing’s Saturday briefing on stimulus measures. China: Shares slip ahead of stimulus briefing A day after China shares rebounded on stimulus optimism, Shanghai’s SSE Composite slid 2.5%. Markets digested the unclear choices faced by the U.S. Federal Reserve, as it received U.S. inflation data for September, which came in slightly above expectations, as well as a rise in unemployment benefit numbers. Markets are cautious ahead of Beijing’s Saturday stimulus briefing, at which investors are hoping for more measures to boost the economy. Hong Kong markets were closed for a public holiday. Japan: Nikkei posts small rise and the back of banks and Uniqlo The Nikkei 225 notched a 0.57% rise as it headed into the weekend, led by the financial sector and a 6.09% jump in Uniqlo-owner Fast Retailing, which hit an all-time high after reporting stronger-than-expected revenue and profits for the year. Europe: Shares largely unchanged as traders weigh U.S. CPI and unemployment data European stocks hovered early Friday as traders digested U.S. inflation and jobless benefits data in the run-up to China’s Saturday stimulus briefing. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 was down 0.13% in early trading, while the STOXX Europe 600 was down 0.07%. BP slipped some 0.5% after it announced that lower than expected refining margins would cut quarterly earnings by $400-600 million. U.S. premarket slips as Tesla robotaxi reveal does not impress The main U.S. indexes were all down slightly in premarket trading Friday. Investors digested the slightly warm September CPI inflation numbers, and punished Tesla with a 5.88% premarket haircut after its Thursday evening Cybercab reveal failed to live up to their hopes. On Thursday, Wall Street retreated from its records following the dual reports showing cooling inflation and climbing unemployment. And earnings season continues… JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and BlackRock report on Friday, while Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Citigroup all show their numbers Tuesday. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

What caught my eye this week. I belatedly enjoyed Dumb Money on Netflix this week. Finumus put me onto it as a chaser to the story in my Active Antics links below about the Canadian who made and lost $300m trading Tesla options. Dumb Money is hilarious (whereas that second story is almost tragic) but it’s also a solid piece of filmmaking. The movie deftly captures the time and (all over the) place when Reddit GameStop trading was at its height. From Covid in the backdrop and mask-wearing on the metro to how it transmutes Pied Piper and YouTuber Roaring Kitty’s riffing into the void into almost a communal event – like some virtual version of Woodstock for Gen-Z – you can imagine it being watched in future decades as a historical drama. For a darker follow-up to this follow-up, also read of Freddie deBoer, who this week offered a cold take on why the meme trading phenomenon still comes with cult-like language from its adherents: Quite literally, everyone who bought into GameStop can’t make money off of doing so because somebody’s got to be late to the selloff. Which is why this whole thing is such a particularly sad expression of aspirational capitalism; the meme stock people celebrate their own jocular spirit of togetherness, but fundamentally all of them are looking, someday, to fuck the people who wait too long. For my part, I said sell very near the height on 28 January 2021. But of course I only had a couple of shares on Freetrade and I’d never have made the stacks racked up by the early diamond hands. Then again neither would most of those who followed Roaring Kitty and the gang. Dumb Money is a great story but it’s not a guide to investing that anyone should follow – except maybe with some fun (dumb) money. Indeed hundreds of millions of ordinary people got richer in that period just by holding the index. As for once in a generation events, joining thousands of spaced-out hippies in a farm would probably be more profitable than playing pass-the-parcel with Reddit’s most degenerate gamblers.

A word of warning: when a cousin died a swine at the Care Home stole her keys and let herself into the house and stole some valuables. “ Quite literally, everyone who bought into GameStop can’t make money off of doing so because somebody’s got to be late to the selloff. Which is why this whole thing is such a particularly sad expression of aspirational capitalism; the meme stock people celebrate their own jocular spirit of togetherness, but fundamentally all of them are looking, someday, to fuck the people who wait too long.” This encapsulates Bitcoin perfectly. Bitcoin is sadly much more harmful than meme stocks due to pointless and eye watering energy wastage. The Canadian Tesla option guy story on Sherwood is possibly even better than Dumb Money. There’s probably whole tiers of discussion one could have about the duties and boilerplate protection for “financial advice” from organisations but it does seem that he might have a case that professionals singularly failed to save him from himself. Though I suspect reading between the lines he might also have been suing them if they’d moved a substantial chunk of his portfolio into boring indexes and he’d missed out on further Tesla growth. Guess I can’t quite understand the mentality that let it all ride on one company (and let’s face it one highly unstable individual). Mind you I’d likely have cashed out at below the first C$10m and gone to live a quiet life. Great to hear Monevator name up in lights on the fantastic Merryn (Summerset Webb) Talks Money podcast this week! Hopefully that drove some extra traffic to the website. The episode was “How safe is your pension pot” released on Tuesday, if anyone wants to listen (only 12 mins long) John Stepek is clearly a long term reader, which is (well deserved ) high praise, for the treasure trove of insight that is Monevator “…joining thousands of spaced-out hippies in a farm…” Unless it’s the one with the special kool-aid To many Keith Gill was a folk hero and probably remains so. There were lots of Keith Gills but he cut through just at the right time. It’s more a socio-political story than investing one of course and the lessons and some of basic themes from the story will not doubt replayed in part in the forthcoming US election. I will be booking a movie ticket for some light entertainment. Leave a Comment Name * Email * Website Comment Notify me of followup comments via e-mail. You can also subscribe without commenting.

Title: Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT) Considers Expansion in Gujarat or Assam, Urges India to Boost Incentives for Suppliers

We recently compiled a list of the 35 AI News You Should Not Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) stands against the other AI stocks you should not miss. The AI industry is constantly evolving and investors are keeping a close eye on investments, advancements in AI capabilities, and new partnerships to keep pace with the continued rise of generative AI and integration into key industries. One of the most exciting developments in the field of AI over the past week has been the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics, which was awarded to scientists John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton for their pioneering work in the field of machine learning. Hopfield, a researcher at Princeton University, gained recognition for developing an associative memory system, a neural network model capable of storing and reconstructing images or other data patterns. His work revolutionized how data patterns can be represented and recalled, marking significant progress in the field of artificial intelligence. Meanwhile, Hinton, a professor at the University of Toronto, pioneered a method for autonomously discovering data properties, enabling machines to perform tasks such as identifying specific elements within images. His contributions have been pivotal in advancing AI capacity for image recognition and pattern identification. Another notable report worthy of mention is a recent Reuters study into the funding that AI startups have attracted so far this year. The study highlights the $6.6 billion funding round for AI startup OpenAI recently that pushed the valuation of the company to more than $157 billion. It also spotlights other AI startups that have received more than $500 million in funding this year. These include xAI, CoreWeave, Scale AI, Figure AI, Groq, Mistral AI, and Cohere. They have raised $6 billion, $1.1 billion, $1 billion, $657 million, $640 million, $600 million, and $500 million in funding so far this year, respectively. The startups are all valued at more than $2.5 billion, with xAI, founded by Tesla chief Elon Musk, worth over $24 billion. A recent report by Goldman Sachs reveals that businesses worldwide are projected to spend nearly $1 trillion in the coming years on building AI infrastructure. The report underscores the massive scale of investment needed to meet the growing demand for AI technologies across various industries. In 2024 alone, venture capital firms have already completed around 200 deals with AI companies, pouring in nearly $22 billion in funding. The average size of these funding rounds exceeds $100 million, reflecting the increasing valuation of AI startups, which now often surpass $1 billion. Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. Our Methodology For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A technician in a clean room assembling a semiconductor chip using a microscope. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 77 Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) provides equipment, services, and software for the semiconductor industry. Latest reports, published by news outlets in India, suggest that the chipmaker could set up operations at Dholera and Sanand in Gujarat or Morigaon in Assam. The reports quote Prabu Raja, the president of the Semiconductor Products Group at Applied Materials, on the sidelines of the Semicon India 2024 event. Raja advised authorities in India to make incentives more lucrative for the suppliers. Per the executive, the company wanted suppliers to get the same incentives, or close to the same, that manufacturers did. Raja, however, praised the cost benefits of working in the Asian country. Overall AMAT ranks 18th on our list of the AI stocks you should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of AMAT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMAT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: ‘Cardano Isn’t Dying’: Charles Hoskinson Defends Project Amid ADA Price Criticism
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/cardano-isnt-dying-charles-hoskinson-defends-project-amid-ada-price-criticism/
Time Published: 2024-10-11T03:30:37Z
Full Content:
Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson took X to defend the project from its detractors, arguing that the network has continued to grow and thrive despite the criticism. As ADA’s price falls 2.9%, some analysts warn of the next key level to watch out for. On Thursday, Charles Hoskinson addressed the adverse response towards Cardano in an X post. Hoskinson noted that the crypto community’s sentiment about the project has lately been more negative than usual. However, he argued that Twitter’s sentiment change isn’t a reflection of the project failing “but rather the desired result of Voltaire.” Cardano’s “Voltaire” era is set to turn the network into “the most advanced blockchain governance system,” focusing on decentralized governance and its future sustainability. Hoskinson believes that Cardano’s collaborative efforts and the transparency of the network is what sets it apart from the rest of the crypto space. “It’s why we are loathed by a lot of others. Their backroom deals and dirty tricks can’t be hidden because there is no one to ask to do it under the table,” he added. In the post, the project’s founder also underscored Cardano’s “passion” for integrity and long-term vision for growth and progress: Short-term thinking, market manipulation, and companies seeking a handout have no role or place here. That’s the difference that makes a difference. Lastly, Hoskinson remarked that the project is not dying but “thriving and growing.” He that ADA is one of the last cryptocurrencies still wanting to be a real crypto instead of “the patron of Blackrock and Wall Street for number go up preferences.” The crypto community reacted to Hoskinson’s message, with many arguing that, regardless of the developments, the Network’s “lack of volume” and “limited” ecosystem growth remains a problem for its community. Meanwhile, part of ADA’s community agreed with Hoskinson, concurring that “it is the only chain that has truly built what I can only see as the groundwork to deliver on the promise of crypto.” Despite the ongoing criticism, some market watchers remain bullish about ADA’s future price action. Crypto analyst Dan Gambardello recently predicted that the cryptocurrency will “easily” reclaim the $1 mark before year’s end. To Gambardello, the exponential surge “could happen fast” and leave many “flabbergasted.” Additionally, he stated that after the 200% surge, ADA’s potential targets of $5 and $10 would “look more realistic.” Conversely, crypto analyst Sebastian warned about a key level to watch for following ADA’s recent performance. Earlier this week, the analyst highlighted that ADA showed signs of a breakout after retesting the trendline it had recently broken above $0.35. However, the cryptocurrency’s price dropped 2.9% in the last 24 hours, falling below the $0.34 mark. The analyst signaled that ADA must hold the current levels as failing to bounce from the $0.335 level could send the token to a retest of the $0.30 support level. As of this writing, ADA is trading at $0.337, a 1.95% and 2% decline in the weekly and monthly timeframes. Rubmar is a writer and translator who has been a crypto enthusiast for the past four years. Her goal as a writer is to create informative, complete, and easily understandable pieces accessible to those entering the crypto space. After learning about cryptocurrencies in 2019, Rubmar became curious about the world of possibilities the industry offered, quickly learning that financial freedom was at the palm of her hand with the developing technology. Rubmar is a writer and translator who has been a crypto enthusiast for the past four years. Her goal as a writer is to create informative, complete, and easily understandable pieces accessible to those entering the crypto space. After learning about cryptocurrencies in 2019, Rubmar became curious about the world of possibilities the industry offered, quickly learning that financial freedom was at the palm of her hand with the developing technology. From a young age, Rubmar was curious about how languages work, finding special interest in wordplay and the peculiarities of dialects. Her curiosity grew as she became an avid reader in her teenage years. She explored freedom and new words through her favorite books, which shaped her view of the world. Rubmar acquired the necessary skills for in-depth research and analytical thinking at university, where she studied Literature and Linguistics. Her studies have given her a sharp perspective on several topics and allowed her to turn every stone in her investigations. In 2019, she first dipped her toes in the crypto industry when a friend introduced her to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, but it wasn’t until 2020 that she started to dive into the depth of the industry. As Rubmar began to understand the mechanics of the crypto sphere, she saw a new world yet to be explored. At the beginning of her crypto voyage, she discovered a new system that allowed her to have control over her finances. As a young adult of the 21st century, Rubmar has faced the challenges of the traditional banking system and the restrictions of fiat money. After the failure of her home country’s economy, the limitations of traditional finances became clear. The bureaucratic, outdated structure made her feel hopeless and powerless amid an aggressive and distorted system created by hyperinflation. However, learning about decentralization and self-custody opened a realm of opportunities. Cryptocurrencies allowed her to experience financial control for the first time and expand her financial education. Moreover, the peculiar nature of the crypto community sparked Rubmar’s curiosity about the other layers of the industry. As a result, she found a particular interest in discovering the diverse perspectives of investors, market watchers, experts, and developers. Her attempts to better understand the crypto space made her realize the strong links of the community with other industries, enriching her perspective of the sector. As someone who spends most of her day online, Rubmar enjoys finding the points where the crypto world meets with her other passions and hobbies ­–or her favorite memes. In her free time, she usually finds joy in different art forms. As a child, she enlisted in every extra-curricular activity in her hometown, including music classes, dancing, jewelry making, and the local chorus. Despite her many attempts to learn different instruments, Rubmar only knows how to play the xylophone, which she played for 7 years in her school’s marching band. She also has a passion for learning new languages and cultures, having set the goal to learn another six languages ­– currently attempting to learn Italian and Korean. Scrapbooking, paper crafting, and bookbinding are her biggest interests outside of work, constantly taking classes and attending workshops to learn new techniques. The rest of her free time is spent stressing over football matches and transfer market news or feeding cats –hers or stray. In summary, Rubmar seeks to present entertaining and educational pieces to be enjoyed by everybody, aiming to report on the latest news and offer a unique perspective while adding a meme or a pun whenever possible.

Shares trade flat on the NSE at ₹609 “Market is likely to remain volatile in the near-term alternating between FII selling and DII buying. Attractive valuations in other markets, particularly in Chinese stocks, will facilitate further selling by FIIs in India since Indian valuations are elevated. Concerns of earnings downgrades in H2 FY 25 render Indian valuations difficult to sustain. However, the sustained flows into the domestic mutual funds, where monthly SIPs have set a new record of Rs 24500 in September, will ensure that all FII selling will be easily absorbed by DII buying. This has been the trend in October so far. A healthy trend in the market is the leading private sector banks getting accumulated and showing resilience even in a weak market.

We recently compiled a list of the 35 AI News You Should Not Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Equinix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX) stands against the other AI stocks you should not miss. The AI industry is constantly evolving and investors are keeping a close eye on investments, advancements in AI capabilities, and new partnerships to keep pace with the continued rise of generative AI and integration into key industries. One of the most exciting developments in the field of AI over the past week has been the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics, which was awarded to scientists John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton for their pioneering work in the field of machine learning. Hopfield, a researcher at Princeton University, gained recognition for developing an associative memory system, a neural network model capable of storing and reconstructing images or other data patterns. His work revolutionized how data patterns can be represented and recalled, marking significant progress in the field of artificial intelligence. Meanwhile, Hinton, a professor at the University of Toronto, pioneered a method for autonomously discovering data properties, enabling machines to perform tasks such as identifying specific elements within images. His contributions have been pivotal in advancing AI capacity for image recognition and pattern identification. Another notable report worthy of mention is a recent Reuters study into the funding that AI startups have attracted so far this year. The study highlights the $6.6 billion funding round for AI startup OpenAI recently that pushed the valuation of the company to more than $157 billion. It also spotlights other AI startups that have received more than $500 million in funding this year. These include xAI, CoreWeave, Scale AI, Figure AI, Groq, Mistral AI, and Cohere. They have raised $6 billion, $1.1 billion, $1 billion, $657 million, $640 million, $600 million, and $500 million in funding so far this year, respectively. The startups are all valued at more than $2.5 billion, with xAI, founded by Tesla chief Elon Musk, worth over $24 billion. A recent report by Goldman Sachs reveals that businesses worldwide are projected to spend nearly $1 trillion in the coming years on building AI infrastructure. The report underscores the massive scale of investment needed to meet the growing demand for AI technologies across various industries. In 2024 alone, venture capital firms have already completed around 200 deals with AI companies, pouring in nearly $22 billion in funding. The average size of these funding rounds exceeds $100 million, reflecting the increasing valuation of AI startups, which now often surpass $1 billion.

(NASDAQ:EQIX) is a California-based real estate trust that operates data centers and other technology assets. HSBC analyst Phani Kanumuri recently upgraded the stock to Buy from Hold with a price target of $1,000, up from $865. The advisory said operational momentum for Equinix and Digital Realty were set to improve significantly in 2025. Data center demand has far outstripped supply in 2024, due to strong artificial intelligence-driven demand and constrained supply in major markets, yet the stocks have underperformed, the advisory told investors in a research note. HSBC said improved utilization is likely to accelerate Equinix's 2025 revenue growth to 10%. Overall EQIX ranks 25th on our list of the AI stocks you should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of EQIX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than EQIX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: New ‘Transparency’ Act Forces Small Businesses To Register Personal Data With Federal Law Enforcement
URL: https://freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/4270135/posts
Time Published: 2024-10-10T22:00:32Z

Skip to comments. Posted on 10/10/2024 3:00:32 PM PDT by george76 By year-end, Americans will be required to hand over data on their small businesses to the federal government’s law enforcement database... The Corporate Transparency Act (CTA) is an aggressive domestic program to federally register millions of unsuspecting small business owners under the guise of an “anti-money laundering initiative.” By the end of this year, Americans will be required to hand over their small businesses’ private data — such as owners’ names and home addresses — to the federal government’s law enforcement database, operated by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), housed under the Department of the Treasury. Such small businesses include limited liability companies, corporations, “and any other entities created by the filing of a document with a secretary of state or any similar office in the United States.” They will also be required to turn over personal data, which can include uploading their driver’s license, passport, marriage certificate, and other non-business related information, into this law enforcement database. This needs to be a front and center campaign issue to protect more than 33 million small business owners, who employ 61 million Americans. The Department of the Treasury already has a history of targeting innocent Americans. During the Lois Lerner scandal, the IRS was forced to admit that it used political partisanship to specifically target conservative groups. The unelected bureaucracy was ultimately forced to settle with the innocent Americans they targeted. CTA is the for-profit equivalent of Department of the Treasury’s partisan overreach. With the IRS scandal, nonprofit organizations with the word “tea party” and “patriot” were targeted and subjected to further scrutiny and/or outright denial of their tax-exempt 501(c)(3) status. Under the CTA, an overly aggressive anti-Second Amendment bureaucrat could decide to do a word search for “gun,” “firearm,” “patriot,” “freedom,” or similar, and they would have a ready list of small business owners to target, investigate, and audit. It happened before with nonprofits, and it will happen again with “for profit” small businesses. The true goal of CTA appears to be setting up yet another new database of citizens to monitor, observe, and punish. The federal government is moving quickly to implement the CTA, as millions of small business owners in the United States have no idea this law even exists (only 13 percent of businesses in California, 5 percent in Ohio, and 4 percent in Pennsylvania have registered). Millions of businesses owners face becoming felons in three months unless they comply. There are currently seven separate lawsuits challenging the validity of the law. Last year, the House of Representatives passed a bill to give businesses more time to comply, but the bill is sitting in the Senate going nowhere. A recent email from their accountant may have been the first time many businesses realized this law exists. The legal confusion and seeming lack of urgency to inform the public suggest that FinCEN’s true intent is to “catch” millions of small business owners in “non-compliance” so that they can be investigated and audited by Department of the Treasury and punished. Serious criminals will not be concerned about paperwork violations. Mandatory compliance is required by January 1, 2025, or business owners will be subjected to hefty fines of $591 dollars per day (or up to 10 percent of a company’s annual receipts) and up to two years in federal prison. Unconstitutional Power Grab.. President Trump vetoed this unconstitutional power grab, as part of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2021, but his veto was overridden. In an unprecedented act of overreach, the feds are moving to collect data on all small business owners, who make up the backbone of the U.S. economy, for reasons that seem murky at best. And the information collected goes to FinCEN, the counterterrorism arm of the Treasury. Business owners have to register with a terrorism department. This seems to infer criminality on millions of law-abiding citizens. Under CTA, for-profit business entities with fewer than 20 employees and under $5 million in revenue are in the crosshairs. But businesses that make more than $5 million annually, or employ more than 20 full-time employees, are exempt from this invasive self-reporting requirement that could put owners in prison. That means BlackRock, Amazon, Facebook, Pfizer, etc., can operate “business as usual,” but “Grandma’s Donut Shop” will be required to show her “paper’s please” if she wants to make a living. Massive Economic Surveillance Program.. Business registration and entity creation has always been handled at the state level through State Corporation Commissions. With the CTA, even though a business is a registered entity at the state level, if it does not then self-report and register into a criminal database at the federal level, owners will not be able to operate the business. The federal government is overreaching into a state rights issue and creating a massive database in violation of the commerce clause. State attorneys general in every state should be weighing in on this issue. Unfortunately, their silence is deafening. Every small business owner in America needs to make their voice heard on this issue, and lawyers who care about the future of this country should be lining up to represent them pro bono. CTA is the last nail in the coffin of what remains of the illusion of a “free market” economy in the United States. It is nothing more than a massive economic surveillance program with no discernable oversight. Lawsuits.. A federal judge in Alabama has already ruled this law unconstitutional, yet the federal government continues to move full speed ahead. The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) has an ongoing legal challenge against the U.S. government and the CTA. However, while a ruling bars the U.S. Treasury from enforcing the CTA against NFIB, it does not enjoin enforcement against others. The government has appealed the ruling. In another legal challenge from the National Small Business United (NSBU), the NSBU alleges that Congress exceeded its powers in requiring that small businesses report their beneficial ownership information to FinCEN. This battle could go all the way to the Supreme Court. Both camps — Republicans and Democrats — need to weigh in on this before the November election. This is the most dangerous step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing small private business ownership under a federal umbrella; a tactic long practiced and executed by Marxist governments. It’s time to stand up to this blatant attack on state’s rights that seeks to control and destroy the economic lifeblood of America.

Child in need of a CGM system. https://gofund.me/6452dbf1. ) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 14 | View Replies] To: george76; All Thank you for referencing that article george76. "By the end of this year, Americans will be required to hand over their small businesses’ private data — such as owners’ names and home addresses — to the federal government’s law enforcement database, operated by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network [??? emphasis added] (FinCEN), housed under the Department of the Treasury." The repealable (hint) 16th Amendment (16A; direct taxes) is probably the federal government's best justification for establishing the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. There's little doubt concerning FinCEN that the feds want make sure that oppressed taxpayers pay every penny of unconstitutional taxes that the unconstitutionally big federal government steals from them imo. The ill-conceived 17th Amendment (17A), popular voting for federal senators, needs to disappear too. Consider that the 16th and 17th Amendments effectively repealed federal government's constitutionally limited power imo, including Supreme Court-clarified limited power to appropriate taxes. "16th Amendment : The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived [emphasis added], without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration.""Congress is not empowered to tax for those purposes which are within the exclusive province of the States." —Justice John Marshall, Gibbons v. Ogden, 1824.“If the tax be not proposed for the common defence, or general welfare, but for other objects, wholly extraneous, (as for instance, for propagating Mahometanism among the Turks, or giving aids and subsidies to a foreign nation, to build palaces for its kings, or erect monuments to its heroes,) it would be wholly indefensible upon constitutional principles [emphases added].” — Justice Joseph Story, Commentaries on the Constitution 2 (1833). The congressional record shows that Rep. John Bingham, a constitutional lawmaker, had clarified the federal government's constitutionally limited powers as follows. ”Simply this, that the care of the property, the liberty, and the life of the citizen, under the solemn sanction of an oath imposed by your Constitution, is in the States and not in the federal government [emphases added]. I have sought to effect no change in that respect in the Constitution of the country.” —John Bingham, Congressional. Globe. 1866, page 1292 (see top half of third column) “Cherish, therefore, the spirit of our people, and keep alive their attention. If once they become inattentive to the public affairs, you and I, and Congress and Assemblies, judges and governors, shall all become wolves [emphasis added]. It seems to be the law of our general nature.” - Thomas Jefferson (Letter to Edward Carrington January 16, 1787)Pelosi: "We have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it." (non-FR; 6 sec.)Illegals are indeed getting immediate Social Security, contrary to Democrat claims (7.11.24)Arizona Sheriff: Illegal Immigrants Being Handed $5,000 Visa Gift Cards, Cell Phones, And Plane Tickets (12.7.23)Democrats [and RINOs] Are Terrified Of An Educated And Informed Public (3.12.23) Since Congress and likewise renegade states have repeatedly proven that they are enemies of the people imo, it is now up to Democratic and Republican Trump supporters to effectively "impeach and remove" ALL (exceptions?) state and federal lawmakers and executives in November. In fact, it's up to us Trump supporters to take the first MAJOR step in draining the swamp by supporting hopeful Trump 47 with a new, Constitution-respecting Congress, new state lawmakers too, not only so that he will not be a lame duck president from the first day of his second term, but will support him to quickly finish draining the swamp. Supporting Trump to finish draining the swamp includes supporting him to put a stop to unconstitutional federal taxes by leading the states to repeal 16&17A, effectively "seceding" ALL the states from the unconstitutionally big federal government by doing so.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson The Corporate Transparency Act (CTA) is an aggressive domestic program to federally register millions of unsuspecting small business owners under the guise of an “anti-money laundering initiative.” By the end of this year, Americans will be required to hand over their small businesses’ private data — such as owners’ names and home addresses — to the federal government’s law enforcement database, operated by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), housed under the Department of the Treasury. Such small businesses include limited liability companies, corporations, “and any other entities created by the filing of a document with a secretary of state or any similar office in the United States.” They will also be required to turn over personal data, which can include uploading their driver’s license, passport, marriage certificate, and other non-business related information, into this law enforcement database. This needs to be a front and center campaign issue to protect more than 33 million small business owners, who employ 61 million Americans. The Department of the Treasury already has a history of targeting innocent Americans. During the Lois Lerner scandal, the IRS was forced to admit that it used political partisanship to specifically target conservative groups. The unelected bureaucracy was ultimately forced to settle with the innocent Americans they targeted. CTA is the for-profit equivalent of Department of the Treasury’s partisan overreach. With the IRS scandal, nonprofit organizations with the word “tea party” and “patriot” were targeted and subjected to further scrutiny and/or outright denial of their tax-exempt 501(c)(3) status. Under the CTA, an overly aggressive anti-Second Amendment bureaucrat could decide to do a word search for “gun,” “firearm,” “patriot,” “freedom,” or similar, and they would have a ready list of small business owners to target, investigate, and audit. It happened before with nonprofits, and it will happen again with “for profit” small businesses. The true goal of CTA appears to be setting up yet another new database of citizens to monitor, observe, and punish. The federal government is moving quickly to implement the CTA, as millions of small business owners in the United States have no idea this law even exists (only 13 percent of businesses in California, 5 percent in Ohio, and 4 percent in Pennsylvania have registered). Millions of businesses owners face becoming felons in three months unless they comply. There are currently seven separate lawsuits challenging the validity of the law. Last year, the House of Representatives passed a bill to give businesses more time to comply, but the bill is sitting in the Senate going nowhere. A recent email from their accountant may have been the first time many businesses realized this law exists. The legal confusion and seeming lack of urgency to inform the public suggest that FinCEN’s true intent is to “catch” millions of small business owners in “non-compliance” so that they can be investigated and audited by Department of the Treasury and punished. Serious criminals will not be concerned about paperwork violations. Mandatory compliance is required by January 1, 2025, or business owners will be subjected to hefty fines of $591 dollars per day (or up to 10 percent of a company’s annual receipts) and up to two years in federal prison. Unconstitutional Power Grab.. President Trump vetoed this unconstitutional power grab, as part of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2021, but his veto was overridden. In an unprecedented act of overreach, the feds are moving to collect data on all small business owners, who make up the backbone of the U.S. economy, for reasons that seem murky at best. And the information collected goes to FinCEN, the counterterrorism arm of the Treasury. Business owners have to register with a terrorism department. This seems to infer criminality on millions of law-abiding citizens. Under CTA, for-profit business entities with fewer than 20 employees and under $5 million in revenue are in the crosshairs. But businesses that make more than $5 million annually, or employ more than 20 full-time employees, are exempt from this invasive self-reporting requirement that could put owners in prison. That means BlackRock, Amazon, Facebook, Pfizer, etc., can operate “business as usual,” but “Grandma’s Donut Shop” will be required to show her “paper’s please” if she wants to make a living. Massive Economic Surveillance Program.. Business registration and entity creation has always been handled at the state level through State Corporation Commissions. With the CTA, even though a business is a registered entity at the state level, if it does not then self-report and register into a criminal database at the federal level, owners will not be able to operate the business. The federal government is overreaching into a state rights issue and creating a massive database in violation of the commerce clause. State attorneys general in every state should be weighing in on this issue. Unfortunately, their silence is deafening. Every small business owner in America needs to make their voice heard on this issue, and lawyers who care about the future of this country should be lining up to represent them pro bono. CTA is the last nail in the coffin of what remains of the illusion of a “free market” economy in the United States. It is nothing more than a massive economic surveillance program with no discernable oversight. Lawsuits.. A federal judge in Alabama has already ruled this law unconstitutional, yet the federal government continues to move full speed ahead. The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) has an ongoing legal challenge against the U.S. government and the CTA. However, while a ruling bars the U.S. Treasury from enforcing the CTA against NFIB, it does not enjoin enforcement against others. The government has appealed the ruling. In another legal challenge from the National Small Business United (NSBU), the NSBU alleges that Congress exceeded its powers in requiring that small businesses report their beneficial ownership information to FinCEN. This battle could go all the way to the Supreme Court. Both camps — Republicans and Democrats — need to weigh in on this before the November election. This is the most dangerous step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing small private business ownership under a federal umbrella; a tactic long practiced and executed by Marxist governments. It’s time to stand up to this blatant attack on state’s rights that seeks to control and destroy the economic lifeblood of America.

"By the end of this year, Americans will be required to hand over their small businesses’ private data — such as owners’ names and home addresses — to the federal government’s law enforcement database, operated by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network [??? emphasis added] (FinCEN), housed under the Department of the Treasury." The repealable (hint) 16th Amendment (16A; direct taxes) is probably the federal government's best justification for establishing the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. There's little doubt concerning FinCEN that the feds want make sure that oppressed taxpayers pay every penny of unconstitutional taxes that the unconstitutionally big federal government steals from them imo. The ill-conceived 17th Amendment (17A), popular voting for federal senators, needs to disappear too. Consider that the 16th and 17th Amendments effectively repealed federal government's constitutionally limited power imo, including Supreme Court-clarified limited power to appropriate taxes. "16th Amendment : The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived [emphasis added], without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration.""Congress is not empowered to tax for those purposes which are within the exclusive province of the States." —Justice John Marshall, Gibbons v. Ogden, 1824.“If the tax be not proposed for the common defence, or general welfare, but for other objects, wholly extraneous, (as for instance, for propagating Mahometanism among the Turks, or giving aids and subsidies to a foreign nation, to build palaces for its kings, or erect monuments to its heroes,) it would be wholly indefensible upon constitutional principles [emphases added].” — Justice Joseph Story, Commentaries on the Constitution 2 (1833). The congressional record shows that Rep. John Bingham, a constitutional lawmaker, had clarified the federal government's constitutionally limited powers as follows. ”Simply this, that the care of the property, the liberty, and the life of the citizen, under the solemn sanction of an oath imposed by your Constitution, is in the States and not in the federal government [emphases added]. I have sought to effect no change in that respect in the Constitution of the country.” —John Bingham, Congressional. Globe. 1866, page 1292 (see top half of third column) “Cherish, therefore, the spirit of our people, and keep alive their attention. If once they become inattentive to the public affairs, you and I, and Congress and Assemblies, judges and governors, shall all become wolves [emphasis added]. It seems to be the law of our general nature.” - Thomas Jefferson (Letter to Edward Carrington January 16, 1787)Pelosi: "We have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it."

In fact, it's up to us Trump supporters to take the first MAJOR step in draining the swamp by supporting hopeful Trump 47 with a new, Constitution-respecting Congress, new state lawmakers too, not only so that he will not be a lame duck president from the first day of his second term, but will support him to quickly finish draining the swamp. Supporting Trump to finish draining the swamp includes supporting him to put a stop to unconstitutional federal taxes by leading the states to repeal 16&17A, effectively "seceding" ALL the states from the unconstitutionally big federal government by doing so.

"By the end of this year, Americans will be required to hand over their small businesses’ private data — such as owners’ names and home addresses — to the federal government’s law enforcement database, operated by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network [??? emphasis added] (FinCEN), housed under the Department of the Treasury." The repealable (hint) 16th Amendment (16A; direct taxes) is probably the federal government's best justification for establishing the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. There's little doubt concerning FinCEN that the feds want make sure that oppressed taxpayers pay every penny of unconstitutional taxes that the unconstitutionally big federal government steals from them imo. The ill-conceived 17th Amendment (17A), popular voting for federal senators, needs to disappear too. Consider that the 16th and 17th Amendments effectively repealed federal government's constitutionally limited power imo, including Supreme Court-clarified limited power to appropriate taxes. "16th Amendment : The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived [emphasis added], without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration.""Congress is not empowered to tax for those purposes which are within the exclusive province of the States." —Justice John Marshall, Gibbons v. Ogden, 1824.“If the tax be not proposed for the common defence, or general welfare, but for other objects, wholly extraneous, (as for instance, for propagating Mahometanism among the Turks, or giving aids and subsidies to a foreign nation, to build palaces for its kings, or erect monuments to its heroes,) it would be wholly indefensible upon constitutional principles [emphases added].” — Justice Joseph Story, Commentaries on the Constitution 2 (1833). The congressional record shows that Rep. John Bingham, a constitutional lawmaker, had clarified the federal government's constitutionally limited powers as follows. ”Simply this, that the care of the property, the liberty, and the life of the citizen, under the solemn sanction of an oath imposed by your Constitution, is in the States and not in the federal government [emphases added]. I have sought to effect no change in that respect in the Constitution of the country.” —John Bingham, Congressional. Globe. 1866, page 1292 (see top half of third column) “Cherish, therefore, the spirit of our people, and keep alive their attention. If once they become inattentive to the public affairs, you and I, and Congress and Assemblies, judges and governors, shall all become wolves [emphasis added]. It seems to be the law of our general nature.” - Thomas Jefferson (Letter to Edward Carrington January 16, 1787)Pelosi: "We have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it." (non-FR; 6 sec.)Illegals are indeed getting immediate Social Security, contrary to Democrat claims (7.11.24)Arizona Sheriff: Illegal Immigrants Being Handed $5,000 Visa Gift Cards, Cell Phones, And Plane Tickets (12.7.23)Democrats [and RINOs] Are Terrified Of An Educated And Informed Public (3.12.23) Since Congress and likewise renegade states have repeatedly proven that they are enemies of the people imo, it is now up to Democratic and Republican Trump supporters to effectively "impeach and remove" ALL (exceptions?) state and federal lawmakers and executives in November. In fact, it's up to us Trump supporters to take the first MAJOR step in draining the swamp by supporting hopeful Trump 47 with a new, Constitution-respecting Congress, new state lawmakers too, not only so that he will not be a lame duck president from the first day of his second term, but will support him to quickly finish draining the swamp. Supporting Trump to finish draining the swamp includes supporting him to put a stop to unconstitutional federal taxes by leading the states to repeal 16&17A, effectively "seceding" ALL the states from the unconstitutionally big federal government by doing so. Finally, let's not allow the anti-Trump media try to fade our memories of what we witnessed on July 13. BREAKING!

This needs to be a front and center campaign issue to protect more than 33 million small business owners, who employ 61 million Americans. The Department of the Treasury already has a history of targeting innocent Americans. During the Lois Lerner scandal, the IRS was forced to admit that it used political partisanship to specifically target conservative groups. The unelected bureaucracy was ultimately forced to settle with the innocent Americans they targeted. CTA is the for-profit equivalent of Department of the Treasury’s partisan overreach. With the IRS scandal, nonprofit organizations with the word “tea party” and “patriot” were targeted and subjected to further scrutiny and/or outright denial of their tax-exempt 501(c)(3) status. Under the CTA, an overly aggressive anti-Second Amendment bureaucrat could decide to do a word search for “gun,” “firearm,” “patriot,” “freedom,” or similar, and they would have a ready list of small business owners to target, investigate, and audit. It happened before with nonprofits, and it will happen again with “for profit” small businesses. The true goal of CTA appears to be setting up yet another new database of citizens to monitor, observe, and punish. The federal government is moving quickly to implement the CTA, as millions of small business owners in the United States have no idea this law even exists (only 13 percent of businesses in California, 5 percent in Ohio, and 4 percent in Pennsylvania have registered). Millions of businesses owners face becoming felons in three months unless they comply. There are currently seven separate lawsuits challenging the validity of the law. Last year, the House of Representatives passed a bill to give businesses more time to comply, but the bill is sitting in the Senate going nowhere. A recent email from their accountant may have been the first time many businesses realized this law exists. The legal confusion and seeming lack of urgency to inform the public suggest that FinCEN’s true intent is to “catch” millions of small business owners in “non-compliance” so that they can be investigated and audited by Department of the Treasury and punished. Serious criminals will not be concerned about paperwork violations. Mandatory compliance is required by January 1, 2025, or business owners will be subjected to hefty fines of $591 dollars per day (or up to 10 percent of a company’s annual receipts) and up to two years in federal prison. Unconstitutional Power Grab.. President Trump vetoed this unconstitutional power grab, as part of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2021, but his veto was overridden. In an unprecedented act of overreach, the feds are moving to collect data on all small business owners, who make up the backbone of the U.S. economy, for reasons that seem murky at best. And the information collected goes to FinCEN, the counterterrorism arm of the Treasury. Business owners have to register with a terrorism department. This seems to infer criminality on millions of law-abiding citizens. Under CTA, for-profit business entities with fewer than 20 employees and under $5 million in revenue are in the crosshairs. But businesses that make more than $5 million annually, or employ more than 20 full-time employees, are exempt from this invasive self-reporting requirement that could put owners in prison. That means BlackRock, Amazon, Facebook, Pfizer, etc., can operate “business as usual,” but “Grandma’s Donut Shop” will be required to show her “paper’s please” if she wants to make a living. Massive Economic Surveillance Program.. Business registration and entity creation has always been handled at the state level through State Corporation Commissions. With the CTA, even though a business is a registered entity at the state level, if it does not then self-report and register into a criminal database at the federal level, owners will not be able to operate the business. The federal government is overreaching into a state rights issue and creating a massive database in violation of the commerce clause. State attorneys general in every state should be weighing in on this issue. Unfortunately, their silence is deafening. Every small business owner in America needs to make their voice heard on this issue, and lawyers who care about the future of this country should be lining up to represent them pro bono. CTA is the last nail in the coffin of what remains of the illusion of a “free market” economy in the United States. It is nothing more than a massive economic surveillance program with no discernable oversight. Lawsuits.. A federal judge in Alabama has already ruled this law unconstitutional, yet the federal government continues to move full speed ahead. The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) has an ongoing legal challenge against the U.S. government and the CTA. However, while a ruling bars the U.S. Treasury from enforcing the CTA against NFIB, it does not enjoin enforcement against others. The government has appealed the ruling. In another legal challenge from the National Small Business United (NSBU), the NSBU alleges that Congress exceeded its powers in requiring that small businesses report their beneficial ownership information to FinCEN. This battle could go all the way to the Supreme Court. Both camps — Republicans and Democrats — need to weigh in on this before the November election. This is the most dangerous step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing small private business ownership under a federal umbrella; a tactic long practiced and executed by Marxist governments. It’s time to stand up to this blatant attack on state’s rights that seeks to control and destroy the economic lifeblood of America.

However, while a ruling bars the U.S. Treasury from enforcing the CTA against NFIB, it does not enjoin enforcement against others. The government has appealed the ruling. In another legal challenge from the National Small Business United (NSBU), the NSBU alleges that Congress exceeded its powers in requiring that small businesses report their beneficial ownership information to FinCEN. This battle could go all the way to the Supreme Court. Both camps — Republicans and Democrats — need to weigh in on this before the November election. This is the most dangerous step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing small private business ownership under a federal umbrella; a tactic long practiced and executed by Marxist governments. It’s time to stand up to this blatant attack on state’s rights that seeks to control and destroy the economic lifeblood of America.

The repealable (hint) 16th Amendment (16A; direct taxes) is probably the federal government's best justification for establishing the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. There's little doubt concerning FinCEN that the feds want make sure that oppressed taxpayers pay every penny of unconstitutional taxes that the unconstitutionally big federal government steals from them imo. The ill-conceived 17th Amendment (17A), popular voting for federal senators, needs to disappear too. Consider that the 16th and 17th Amendments effectively repealed federal government's constitutionally limited power imo, including Supreme Court-clarified limited power to appropriate taxes. "16th Amendment : The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived [emphasis added], without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration.""Congress is not empowered to tax for those purposes which are within the exclusive province of the States." —Justice John Marshall, Gibbons v. Ogden, 1824.“If the tax be not proposed for the common defence, or general welfare, but for other objects, wholly extraneous, (as for instance, for propagating Mahometanism among the Turks, or giving aids and subsidies to a foreign nation, to build palaces for its kings, or erect monuments to its heroes,) it would be wholly indefensible upon constitutional principles [emphases added].” — Justice Joseph Story, Commentaries on the Constitution 2 (1833). The congressional record shows that Rep. John Bingham, a constitutional lawmaker, had clarified the federal government's constitutionally limited powers as follows. ”Simply this, that the care of the property, the liberty, and the life of the citizen, under the solemn sanction of an oath imposed by your Constitution, is in the States and not in the federal government [emphases added]. I have sought to effect no change in that respect in the Constitution of the country.” —John Bingham, Congressional.

Supporting Trump to finish draining the swamp includes supporting him to put a stop to unconstitutional federal taxes by leading the states to repeal 16&17A, effectively "seceding" ALL the states from the unconstitutionally big federal government by doing so.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson The Department of the Treasury already has a history of targeting innocent Americans. During the Lois Lerner scandal, the IRS was forced to admit that it used political partisanship to specifically target conservative groups. The unelected bureaucracy was ultimately forced to settle with the innocent Americans they targeted. CTA is the for-profit equivalent of Department of the Treasury’s partisan overreach. With the IRS scandal, nonprofit organizations with the word “tea party” and “patriot” were targeted and subjected to further scrutiny and/or outright denial of their tax-exempt 501(c)(3) status. Under the CTA, an overly aggressive anti-Second Amendment bureaucrat could decide to do a word search for “gun,” “firearm,” “patriot,” “freedom,” or similar, and they would have a ready list of small business owners to target, investigate, and audit. It happened before with nonprofits, and it will happen again with “for profit” small businesses. The true goal of CTA appears to be setting up yet another new database of citizens to monitor, observe, and punish. The federal government is moving quickly to implement the CTA, as millions of small business owners in the United States have no idea this law even exists (only 13 percent of businesses in California, 5 percent in Ohio, and 4 percent in Pennsylvania have registered). Millions of businesses owners face becoming felons in three months unless they comply. There are currently seven separate lawsuits challenging the validity of the law. Last year, the House of Representatives passed a bill to give businesses more time to comply, but the bill is sitting in the Senate going nowhere. A recent email from their accountant may have been the first time many businesses realized this law exists. The legal confusion and seeming lack of urgency to inform the public suggest that FinCEN’s true intent is to “catch” millions of small business owners in “non-compliance” so that they can be investigated and audited by Department of the Treasury and punished. Serious criminals will not be concerned about paperwork violations. Mandatory compliance is required by January 1, 2025, or business owners will be subjected to hefty fines of $591 dollars per day (or up to 10 percent of a company’s annual receipts) and up to two years in federal prison. Unconstitutional Power Grab.. President Trump vetoed this unconstitutional power grab, as part of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2021, but his veto was overridden. In an unprecedented act of overreach, the feds are moving to collect data on all small business owners, who make up the backbone of the U.S. economy, for reasons that seem murky at best. And the information collected goes to FinCEN, the counterterrorism arm of the Treasury. Business owners have to register with a terrorism department. This seems to infer criminality on millions of law-abiding citizens. Under CTA, for-profit business entities with fewer than 20 employees and under $5 million in revenue are in the crosshairs. But businesses that make more than $5 million annually, or employ more than 20 full-time employees, are exempt from this invasive self-reporting requirement that could put owners in prison. That means BlackRock, Amazon, Facebook, Pfizer, etc., can operate “business as usual,” but “Grandma’s Donut Shop” will be required to show her “paper’s please” if she wants to make a living. Massive Economic Surveillance Program.. Business registration and entity creation has always been handled at the state level through State Corporation Commissions. With the CTA, even though a business is a registered entity at the state level, if it does not then self-report and register into a criminal database at the federal level, owners will not be able to operate the business. The federal government is overreaching into a state rights issue and creating a massive database in violation of the commerce clause. State attorneys general in every state should be weighing in on this issue. Unfortunately, their silence is deafening. Every small business owner in America needs to make their voice heard on this issue, and lawyers who care about the future of this country should be lining up to represent them pro bono. CTA is the last nail in the coffin of what remains of the illusion of a “free market” economy in the United States. It is nothing more than a massive economic surveillance program with no discernable oversight. Lawsuits.. A federal judge in Alabama has already ruled this law unconstitutional, yet the federal government continues to move full speed ahead. The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) has an ongoing legal challenge against the U.S. government and the CTA. However, while a ruling bars the U.S. Treasury from enforcing the CTA against NFIB, it does not enjoin enforcement against others. The government has appealed the ruling. In another legal challenge from the National Small Business United (NSBU), the NSBU alleges that Congress exceeded its powers in requiring that small businesses report their beneficial ownership information to FinCEN. This battle could go all the way to the Supreme Court. Both camps — Republicans and Democrats — need to weigh in on this before the November election. This is the most dangerous step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing small private business ownership under a federal umbrella; a tactic long practiced and executed by Marxist governments. It’s time to stand up to this blatant attack on state’s rights that seeks to control and destroy the economic lifeblood of America.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson CTA is the for-profit equivalent of Department of the Treasury’s partisan overreach. With the IRS scandal, nonprofit organizations with the word “tea party” and “patriot” were targeted and subjected to further scrutiny and/or outright denial of their tax-exempt 501(c)(3) status. Under the CTA, an overly aggressive anti-Second Amendment bureaucrat could decide to do a word search for “gun,” “firearm,” “patriot,” “freedom,” or similar, and they would have a ready list of small business owners to target, investigate, and audit. It happened before with nonprofits, and it will happen again with “for profit” small businesses. The true goal of CTA appears to be setting up yet another new database of citizens to monitor, observe, and punish. The federal government is moving quickly to implement the CTA, as millions of small business owners in the United States have no idea this law even exists (only 13 percent of businesses in California, 5 percent in Ohio, and 4 percent in Pennsylvania have registered). Millions of businesses owners face becoming felons in three months unless they comply. There are currently seven separate lawsuits challenging the validity of the law. Last year, the House of Representatives passed a bill to give businesses more time to comply, but the bill is sitting in the Senate going nowhere. A recent email from their accountant may have been the first time many businesses realized this law exists. The legal confusion and seeming lack of urgency to inform the public suggest that FinCEN’s true intent is to “catch” millions of small business owners in “non-compliance” so that they can be investigated and audited by Department of the Treasury and punished. Serious criminals will not be concerned about paperwork violations. Mandatory compliance is required by January 1, 2025, or business owners will be subjected to hefty fines of $591 dollars per day (or up to 10 percent of a company’s annual receipts) and up to two years in federal prison. Unconstitutional Power Grab.. President Trump vetoed this unconstitutional power grab, as part of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2021, but his veto was overridden. In an unprecedented act of overreach, the feds are moving to collect data on all small business owners, who make up the backbone of the U.S. economy, for reasons that seem murky at best. And the information collected goes to FinCEN, the counterterrorism arm of the Treasury. Business owners have to register with a terrorism department. This seems to infer criminality on millions of law-abiding citizens. Under CTA, for-profit business entities with fewer than 20 employees and under $5 million in revenue are in the crosshairs. But businesses that make more than $5 million annually, or employ more than 20 full-time employees, are exempt from this invasive self-reporting requirement that could put owners in prison. That means BlackRock, Amazon, Facebook, Pfizer, etc., can operate “business as usual,” but “Grandma’s Donut Shop” will be required to show her “paper’s please” if she wants to make a living. Massive Economic Surveillance Program.. Business registration and entity creation has always been handled at the state level through State Corporation Commissions. With the CTA, even though a business is a registered entity at the state level, if it does not then self-report and register into a criminal database at the federal level, owners will not be able to operate the business. The federal government is overreaching into a state rights issue and creating a massive database in violation of the commerce clause. State attorneys general in every state should be weighing in on this issue. Unfortunately, their silence is deafening. Every small business owner in America needs to make their voice heard on this issue, and lawyers who care about the future of this country should be lining up to represent them pro bono. CTA is the last nail in the coffin of what remains of the illusion of a “free market” economy in the United States. It is nothing more than a massive economic surveillance program with no discernable oversight. Lawsuits.. A federal judge in Alabama has already ruled this law unconstitutional, yet the federal government continues to move full speed ahead. The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) has an ongoing legal challenge against the U.S. government and the CTA. However, while a ruling bars the U.S. Treasury from enforcing the CTA against NFIB, it does not enjoin enforcement against others. The government has appealed the ruling. In another legal challenge from the National Small Business United (NSBU), the NSBU alleges that Congress exceeded its powers in requiring that small businesses report their beneficial ownership information to FinCEN. This battle could go all the way to the Supreme Court. Both camps — Republicans and Democrats — need to weigh in on this before the November election. This is the most dangerous step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing small private business ownership under a federal umbrella; a tactic long practiced and executed by Marxist governments. It’s time to stand up to this blatant attack on state’s rights that seeks to control and destroy the economic lifeblood of America.

In fact, it's up to us Trump supporters to take the first MAJOR step in draining the swamp by supporting hopeful Trump 47 with a new, Constitution-respecting Congress, new state lawmakers too, not only so that he will not be a lame duck president from the first day of his second term, but will support him to quickly finish draining the swamp. Supporting Trump to finish draining the swamp includes supporting him to put a stop to unconstitutional federal taxes by leading the states to repeal 16&17A, effectively "seceding" ALL the states from the unconstitutionally big federal government by doing so.

In fact, it's up to us Trump supporters to take the first MAJOR step in draining the swamp by supporting hopeful Trump 47 with a new, Constitution-respecting Congress, new state lawmakers too, not only so that he will not be a lame duck president from the first day of his second term, but will support him to quickly finish draining the swamp. Supporting Trump to finish draining the swamp includes supporting him to put a stop to unconstitutional federal taxes by leading the states to repeal 16&17A, effectively "seceding" ALL the states from the unconstitutionally big federal government by doing so.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson There are currently seven separate lawsuits challenging the validity of the law. Last year, the House of Representatives passed a bill to give businesses more time to comply, but the bill is sitting in the Senate going nowhere. A recent email from their accountant may have been the first time many businesses realized this law exists. The legal confusion and seeming lack of urgency to inform the public suggest that FinCEN’s true intent is to “catch” millions of small business owners in “non-compliance” so that they can be investigated and audited by Department of the Treasury and punished. Serious criminals will not be concerned about paperwork violations. Mandatory compliance is required by January 1, 2025, or business owners will be subjected to hefty fines of $591 dollars per day (or up to 10 percent of a company’s annual receipts) and up to two years in federal prison. Unconstitutional Power Grab.. President Trump vetoed this unconstitutional power grab, as part of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2021, but his veto was overridden. In an unprecedented act of overreach, the feds are moving to collect data on all small business owners, who make up the backbone of the U.S. economy, for reasons that seem murky at best. And the information collected goes to FinCEN, the counterterrorism arm of the Treasury. Business owners have to register with a terrorism department. This seems to infer criminality on millions of law-abiding citizens. Under CTA, for-profit business entities with fewer than 20 employees and under $5 million in revenue are in the crosshairs. But businesses that make more than $5 million annually, or employ more than 20 full-time employees, are exempt from this invasive self-reporting requirement that could put owners in prison. That means BlackRock, Amazon, Facebook, Pfizer, etc., can operate “business as usual,” but “Grandma’s Donut Shop” will be required to show her “paper’s please” if she wants to make a living. Massive Economic Surveillance Program.. Business registration and entity creation has always been handled at the state level through State Corporation Commissions. With the CTA, even though a business is a registered entity at the state level, if it does not then self-report and register into a criminal database at the federal level, owners will not be able to operate the business. The federal government is overreaching into a state rights issue and creating a massive database in violation of the commerce clause. State attorneys general in every state should be weighing in on this issue. Unfortunately, their silence is deafening. Every small business owner in America needs to make their voice heard on this issue, and lawyers who care about the future of this country should be lining up to represent them pro bono. CTA is the last nail in the coffin of what remains of the illusion of a “free market” economy in the United States. It is nothing more than a massive economic surveillance program with no discernable oversight. Lawsuits.. A federal judge in Alabama has already ruled this law unconstitutional, yet the federal government continues to move full speed ahead. The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) has an ongoing legal challenge against the U.S. government and the CTA. However, while a ruling bars the U.S. Treasury from enforcing the CTA against NFIB, it does not enjoin enforcement against others. The government has appealed the ruling. In another legal challenge from the National Small Business United (NSBU), the NSBU alleges that Congress exceeded its powers in requiring that small businesses report their beneficial ownership information to FinCEN. This battle could go all the way to the Supreme Court. Both camps — Republicans and Democrats — need to weigh in on this before the November election. This is the most dangerous step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing small private business ownership under a federal umbrella; a tactic long practiced and executed by Marxist governments. It’s time to stand up to this blatant attack on state’s rights that seeks to control and destroy the economic lifeblood of America.

"By the end of this year, Americans will be required to hand over their small businesses’ private data — such as owners’ names and home addresses — to the federal government’s law enforcement database, operated by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network [??? emphasis added] (FinCEN), housed under the Department of the Treasury." The repealable (hint) 16th Amendment (16A; direct taxes) is probably the federal government's best justification for establishing the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. There's little doubt concerning FinCEN that the feds want make sure that oppressed taxpayers pay every penny of unconstitutional taxes that the unconstitutionally big federal government steals from them imo. The ill-conceived 17th Amendment (17A), popular voting for federal senators, needs to disappear too. Consider that the 16th and 17th Amendments effectively repealed federal government's constitutionally limited power imo, including Supreme Court-clarified limited power to appropriate taxes. "16th Amendment : The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived [emphasis added], without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration.""Congress is not empowered to tax for those purposes which are within the exclusive province of the States." —Justice John Marshall, Gibbons v. Ogden, 1824.“If the tax be not proposed for the common defence, or general welfare, but for other objects, wholly extraneous, (as for instance, for propagating Mahometanism among the Turks, or giving aids and subsidies to a foreign nation, to build palaces for its kings, or erect monuments to its heroes,) it would be wholly indefensible upon constitutional principles [emphases added].” — Justice Joseph Story, Commentaries on the Constitution 2 (1833). The congressional record shows that Rep. John Bingham, a constitutional lawmaker, had clarified the federal government's constitutionally limited powers as follows. ”Simply this, that the care of the property, the liberty, and the life of the citizen, under the solemn sanction of an oath imposed by your Constitution, is in the States and not in the federal government [emphases added]. I have sought to effect no change in that respect in the Constitution of the country.” —John Bingham, Congressional. Globe. 1866, page 1292 (see top half of third column) “Cherish, therefore, the spirit of our people, and keep alive their attention. If once they become inattentive to the public affairs, you and I, and Congress and Assemblies, judges and governors, shall all become wolves [emphasis added].

"16th Amendment : The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived [emphasis added], without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration.""Congress is not empowered to tax for those purposes which are within the exclusive province of the States." —Justice John Marshall, Gibbons v. Ogden, 1824.“If the tax be not proposed for the common defence, or general welfare, but for other objects, wholly extraneous, (as for instance, for propagating Mahometanism among the Turks, or giving aids and subsidies to a foreign nation, to build palaces for its kings, or erect monuments to its heroes,) it would be wholly indefensible upon constitutional principles [emphases added].” — Justice Joseph Story, Commentaries on the Constitution 2 (1833). The congressional record shows that Rep. John Bingham, a constitutional lawmaker, had clarified the federal government's constitutionally limited powers as follows. ”Simply this, that the care of the property, the liberty, and the life of the citizen, under the solemn sanction of an oath imposed by your Constitution, is in the States and not in the federal government [emphases added]. I have sought to effect no change in that respect in the Constitution of the country.” —John Bingham, Congressional.

Supporting Trump to finish draining the swamp includes supporting him to put a stop to unconstitutional federal taxes by leading the states to repeal 16&17A, effectively "seceding" ALL the states from the unconstitutionally big federal government by doing so.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson President Trump vetoed this unconstitutional power grab, as part of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2021, but his veto was overridden. In an unprecedented act of overreach, the feds are moving to collect data on all small business owners, who make up the backbone of the U.S. economy, for reasons that seem murky at best. And the information collected goes to FinCEN, the counterterrorism arm of the Treasury. Business owners have to register with a terrorism department. This seems to infer criminality on millions of law-abiding citizens. Under CTA, for-profit business entities with fewer than 20 employees and under $5 million in revenue are in the crosshairs. But businesses that make more than $5 million annually, or employ more than 20 full-time employees, are exempt from this invasive self-reporting requirement that could put owners in prison. That means BlackRock, Amazon, Facebook, Pfizer, etc., can operate “business as usual,” but “Grandma’s Donut Shop” will be required to show her “paper’s please” if she wants to make a living. Massive Economic Surveillance Program.. Business registration and entity creation has always been handled at the state level through State Corporation Commissions. With the CTA, even though a business is a registered entity at the state level, if it does not then self-report and register into a criminal database at the federal level, owners will not be able to operate the business. The federal government is overreaching into a state rights issue and creating a massive database in violation of the commerce clause. State attorneys general in every state should be weighing in on this issue. Unfortunately, their silence is deafening. Every small business owner in America needs to make their voice heard on this issue, and lawyers who care about the future of this country should be lining up to represent them pro bono. CTA is the last nail in the coffin of what remains of the illusion of a “free market” economy in the United States. It is nothing more than a massive economic surveillance program with no discernable oversight. Lawsuits.. A federal judge in Alabama has already ruled this law unconstitutional, yet the federal government continues to move full speed ahead. The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) has an ongoing legal challenge against the U.S. government and the CTA. However, while a ruling bars the U.S. Treasury from enforcing the CTA against NFIB, it does not enjoin enforcement against others. The government has appealed the ruling. In another legal challenge from the National Small Business United (NSBU), the NSBU alleges that Congress exceeded its powers in requiring that small businesses report their beneficial ownership information to FinCEN. This battle could go all the way to the Supreme Court. Both camps — Republicans and Democrats — need to weigh in on this before the November election. This is the most dangerous step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing small private business ownership under a federal umbrella; a tactic long practiced and executed by Marxist governments. It’s time to stand up to this blatant attack on state’s rights that seeks to control and destroy the economic lifeblood of America.

"16th Amendment : The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived [emphasis added], without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration.""Congress is not empowered to tax for those purposes which are within the exclusive province of the States." —Justice John Marshall, Gibbons v. Ogden, 1824.“If the tax be not proposed for the common defence, or general welfare, but for other objects, wholly extraneous, (as for instance, for propagating Mahometanism among the Turks, or giving aids and subsidies to a foreign nation, to build palaces for its kings, or erect monuments to its heroes,) it would be wholly indefensible upon constitutional principles [emphases added].” — Justice Joseph Story, Commentaries on the Constitution 2 (1833). The congressional record shows that Rep. John Bingham, a constitutional lawmaker, had clarified the federal government's constitutionally limited powers as follows. ”Simply this, that the care of the property, the liberty, and the life of the citizen, under the solemn sanction of an oath imposed by your Constitution, is in the States and not in the federal government [emphases added]. I have sought to effect no change in that respect in the Constitution of the country.” —John Bingham, Congressional. Globe. 1866, page 1292 (see top half of third column) “Cherish, therefore, the spirit of our people, and keep alive their attention. If once they become inattentive to the public affairs, you and I, and Congress and Assemblies, judges and governors, shall all become wolves [emphasis added]. It seems to be the law of our general nature.” - Thomas Jefferson (Letter to Edward Carrington January 16, 1787)Pelosi: "We have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it."

In fact, it's up to us Trump supporters to take the first MAJOR step in draining the swamp by supporting hopeful Trump 47 with a new, Constitution-respecting Congress, new state lawmakers too, not only so that he will not be a lame duck president from the first day of his second term, but will support him to quickly finish draining the swamp. Supporting Trump to finish draining the swamp includes supporting him to put a stop to unconstitutional federal taxes by leading the states to repeal 16&17A, effectively "seceding" ALL the states from the unconstitutionally big federal government by doing so.

The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) has an ongoing legal challenge against the U.S. government and the CTA. However, while a ruling bars the U.S. Treasury from enforcing the CTA against NFIB, it does not enjoin enforcement against others. The government has appealed the ruling. In another legal challenge from the National Small Business United (NSBU), the NSBU alleges that Congress exceeded its powers in requiring that small businesses report their beneficial ownership information to FinCEN. This battle could go all the way to the Supreme Court. Both camps — Republicans and Democrats — need to weigh in on this before the November election.

CTA is the last nail in the coffin of what remains of the illusion of a “free market” economy in the United States. It is nothing more than a massive economic surveillance program with no discernable oversight. Lawsuits.. A federal judge in Alabama has already ruled this law unconstitutional, yet the federal government continues to move full speed ahead. The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) has an ongoing legal challenge against the U.S. government and the CTA. However, while a ruling bars the U.S. Treasury from enforcing the CTA against NFIB, it does not enjoin enforcement against others. The government has appealed the ruling. In another legal challenge from the National Small Business United (NSBU), the NSBU alleges that Congress exceeded its powers in requiring that small businesses report their beneficial ownership information to FinCEN. This battle could go all the way to the Supreme Court. Both camps — Republicans and Democrats — need to weigh in on this before the November election. This is the most dangerous step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing small private business ownership under a federal umbrella; a tactic long practiced and executed by Marxist governments. It’s time to stand up to this blatant attack on state’s rights that seeks to control and destroy the economic lifeblood of America.

The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) has an ongoing legal challenge against the U.S. government and the CTA. However, while a ruling bars the U.S. Treasury from enforcing the CTA against NFIB, it does not enjoin enforcement against others. The government has appealed the ruling. In another legal challenge from the National Small Business United (NSBU), the NSBU alleges that Congress exceeded its powers in requiring that small businesses report their beneficial ownership information to FinCEN. This battle could go all the way to the Supreme Court. Both camps — Republicans and Democrats — need to weigh in on this before the November election. This is the most dangerous step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing small private business ownership under a federal umbrella; a tactic long practiced and executed by Marxist governments.

The repealable (hint) 16th Amendment (16A; direct taxes) is probably the federal government's best justification for establishing the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. There's little doubt concerning FinCEN that the feds want make sure that oppressed taxpayers pay every penny of unconstitutional taxes that the unconstitutionally big federal government steals from them imo. The ill-conceived 17th Amendment (17A), popular voting for federal senators, needs to disappear too. Consider that the 16th and 17th Amendments effectively repealed federal government's constitutionally limited power imo, including Supreme Court-clarified limited power to appropriate taxes. "16th Amendment : The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived [emphasis added], without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration.""Congress is not empowered to tax for those purposes which are within the exclusive province of the States." —Justice John Marshall, Gibbons v. Ogden, 1824.“If the tax be not proposed for the common defence, or general welfare, but for other objects, wholly extraneous, (as for instance, for propagating Mahometanism among the Turks, or giving aids and subsidies to a foreign nation, to build palaces for its kings, or erect monuments to its heroes,) it would be wholly indefensible upon constitutional principles [emphases added].” — Justice Joseph Story, Commentaries on the Constitution 2 (1833). The congressional record shows that Rep. John Bingham, a constitutional lawmaker, had clarified the federal government's constitutionally limited powers as follows. ”Simply this, that the care of the property, the liberty, and the life of the citizen, under the solemn sanction of an oath imposed by your Constitution, is in the States and not in the federal government [emphases added]. I have sought to effect no change in that respect in the Constitution of the country.” —John Bingham, Congressional.

Supporting Trump to finish draining the swamp includes supporting him to put a stop to unconstitutional federal taxes by leading the states to repeal 16&17A, effectively "seceding" ALL the states from the unconstitutionally big federal government by doing so.

Crushing small business has always been part of their deal. That includes farmers, by the way. “A federal judge in Alabama has already ruled this law unconstitutional, yet the federal government continues to move full speed ahead.” That seems like a problem. This has been a tremendous pain in the ass. It’s also just snooping. There is zero legitimate reason for this. Crushing small business has always been part of their deal. That includes farmers, by the way. — Farmers, ranchers, loggers, miners, & commercial fishermen - aka The War on Natural Resource Harvesters, since 1974 Many Congress critters are small business owners or co-owners. I bet this gets repealed when their personal data gets delivered....... UN Agenda 21 , 2030 , Great Reset, ( Let me know if you wish to be added or removed from the list.) All the more reason to elect President Trump. Everything inside the state, nothing outside. Benito Mussolini would recognize it. It’s also a money grab. Currently it takes about 15 minutes to fill out but Intuit Quickbooks wanted me to pay them north of $250 to do it for me. bookmark “By the end of this year, Americans will be required to hand over their small businesses’ private data — such as owners’ names and home addresses — to the federal government’s law enforcement database” Small businesses have to provide that information to the IRS anyway. yes - but what about:They will also be required to turn over personal data, which can include uploading their driver’s license, passport, marriage certificate, and other non-business related information, into this law enforcement database. They will also be required to turn over personal data, which can include uploading their driver’s license, passport, marriage certificate, and other non-business related information, into this law enforcement database. State Department has your passport. They issue it. If you file a joint return, they know you’re married. Drivers’ license? Honestly? That’s your “personal information”? Law enforcement can get anything they want on you, but especially public records. This is a tempest in a teapot brewed on Mount Molehill. What’s more, since I’m communicating with you from overseas, we are being monitored under FISA. Or can be. I think anyone monitoring me will be bored and switch to some guy cheating on his wife, smoking reefer or watching porn, or something. Nothing I do is even black-mail-able. "By the end of this year, Americans will be required to hand over their small businesses’ private data — such as owners’ names and home addresses — to the federal government’s law enforcement database, operated by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network [??? emphasis added] (FinCEN), housed under the Department of the Treasury." The repealable (hint) 16th Amendment (16A; direct taxes) is probably the federal government's best justification for establishing the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. There's little doubt concerning FinCEN that the feds want make sure that oppressed taxpayers pay every penny of unconstitutional taxes that the unconstitutionally big federal government steals from them imo. The ill-conceived 17th Amendment (17A), popular voting for federal senators, needs to disappear too. Consider that the 16th and 17th Amendments effectively repealed federal government's constitutionally limited power imo, including Supreme Court-clarified limited power to appropriate taxes. "16th Amendment : The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived [emphasis added], without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration.""Congress is not empowered to tax for those purposes which are within the exclusive province of the States." —Justice John Marshall, Gibbons v. Ogden, 1824.“If the tax be not proposed for the common defence, or general welfare, but for other objects, wholly extraneous, (as for instance, for propagating Mahometanism among the Turks, or giving aids and subsidies to a foreign nation, to build palaces for its kings, or erect monuments to its heroes,) it would be wholly indefensible upon constitutional principles [emphases added].” — Justice Joseph Story, Commentaries on the Constitution 2 (1833). The congressional record shows that Rep. John Bingham, a constitutional lawmaker, had clarified the federal government's constitutionally limited powers as follows. ”Simply this, that the care of the property, the liberty, and the life of the citizen, under the solemn sanction of an oath imposed by your Constitution, is in the States and not in the federal government [emphases added]. I have sought to effect no change in that respect in the Constitution of the country.” —John Bingham, Congressional.

Grace Shao is founder of Proem, a strategic communications consultancy focused on helping tech and AI companies on their global expansion strategy. Who will win the AI arms race? The U.S. is clearly miles ahead of China when it comes to the sophistication of its chips. But an Nvidia processor is only part of what’s needed to adopt AI. AI relies on real-world infrastructure: servers, data centers and stable power. That needs energy, land, and other resources, not just GPUs. And that can be very costly. About a month ago, a consortium of investors including Microsoft and BlackRock pledged to mobilize as much as $100 billion to build data centers in the U.S. and partner countries. “The capital spending needed for AI infrastructure and the new energy to power it goes beyond what any single company or government can finance,” Microsoft president Brad Smith explained at the time. The U.S. will need an incalculable amount of time to build up its physical infrastructure in an economy with more expensive land, labor and power. U.S. democracy also has several bottlenecks and veto points—like local legislation, regulations, and community hearings—that will delay, if not outright halt, new data center construction. And that may mean a huge advantage for China and its state-driven “command economy.” The media and investors tend to focus on computing power, and thus miss much of the real-world work that supports AI. Beijing’s industrial policy and its ability to funnel public and private resources into growing sectors swiftly will make the country a major power in the world of AI, much like it already has proved to be in clean energy and electric vehicles. Being at the leading edge of a new technology means little if a country can’t figure out how to make it work at scale. Expensive infrastructure investments today are needed to support tomorrow’s AI demand. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg recognizes this: In Meta’s most recent earnings call, Zuckerberg defended heavy investments in data centers by arguing the risk of underinvestment, and missing out on “the most critical technology for the next decade and a half” was far greater. “I’d rather risk building capacity before it is needed, rather than too late, given the long lead times for spinning up new infra projects,” he told analysts. The long lead time isn’t due to bottlenecks at Nvidia, but instead something far more mundane. The lead time on new power transformers and generators, needed to power the increased electricity demands from data centers, can be as long as four years. Even if the power equipment is in place, data center operators still need to wait for them to be connected to the grid. Local zoning laws and land permits would also take time, often months or years for approval. Northern Virginia currently has the U.S.’s highest concentration of data centers. According to local power utility Dominion Energy, any data center that consume over 100 megawatts of power will now need to wait as much as three additional years, on top of the current three to four years wait, to get connected to the grid. Big tech firms thus need to spend big on infrastructure today long before they can enjoy a meaningful return on their investments. And if they don’t invest now, they risk falling behind their competitors in the future, or worse, not being able to provide the raw power needed to run faster and more powerful algorithms when the technology advances further. China may be able to ramp up its AI infrastructure faster and more cheaply than the U.S. can. That may not be enough to overcome China’s weakness in producing advanced chips. But if and when China does figure out how to make powerful semiconductors, it can catch up quickly to the U.S., if not potentially overtake it. China’s state-driven system can put resources and energy into infrastructure at a speed and scale unmatched by other countries. Since 2014, the province of Guizhou has been a pilot zone for China’s data center industry. By 2022, the province already had 23 key data centers in operation or under construction, including eight very large data centers. Guizhou is now one of the highest concentrations of large data centers in the world, hosing data for both local giants like Huawei, JD.com and Alibaba, and global companies like Apple and Microsoft. Officials could replicate Guizhou’s success in another province with ample land and little urbanization. Local governments would welcome data center investment, as it leads to new jobs and tax revenue, as well as finding a productive use for land that serves little agricultural purpose. Experts in the industry are starting to realize that China’s advantage in energy and land could help ameliorate China’s lag in chip development. Wang Jian, the founder of Alibaba Cloud, said at a recent conference that China’s ready access to renewable energy gives it a better foundation for AI development compared to the U.S. Zhang Ping’an, CEO of Huawei Cloud, has emphasized China’s strengths in bandwidth, network and energy, and suggested that architectural innovation, rather than reliance on advanced AI chips, could help Chinese cloud computing come out on top. China has previously leveraged scale to build new industries. The country’s command economy rallied clean energy companies, helping grow national and international champions in green energy. Just a decade ago, China had minimal renewable energy. But thanks to government policy and strategic investments in renewable technologies and supply chains, China is now adding more than 200 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity annually. The U.S. adds just 40. Chips—and China’s lack of access to them—are what gets attention today. But infrastructure and data centers could decide the final winner of the AI arms race. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Wall Street retreated from its records on Thursday following dual reports showing cooling inflation and climbing unemployment. U.S.: Stocks slide as eager investors scale back hopes of jumbo Fed rate cutsAfter setting a new all-time high, The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell Thursday 0.14% alongside the S&P 500, which was down 0.21% at the end of trading. The Nasdaq composite was nearly unchanged, moving just 0.052% by the end of the day Thursday. Cooling markets follow a surprise increase in filings for unemployment in the wake of two hurricanes and the Boeing strike. Europe: Shares waver ahead of U.S. CPI as GSK soars on court settlementEuropean stocks slid slightly on U.S inflation data. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 was down a marginal 0.0073% at close, saved from steeper losses as GSK surged nearly 7% on news that the pharma giant had reached a $2.2 billion deal to settle thousands of claims in U.S. courts that linked cancer cases to its heartburn drug Zantac. Meanwhile, the STOXX Europe 600 was down 0.18%. China: Shanghai and Hong Kong markets rebound on renewed stimulus hopesFollowing a sharp decline in mainland China stocks, Shanghai’s SSE Composite gained 1.32%, and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index surged by 2.98%, driven by renewed optimism about economic stimulus. The rebound came after Beijing announced that the finance minister would hold another stimulus briefing on Saturday, sparking expectations of further measures to support the economy. Japan: Nikkei edges up as producer prices surpass expectationsThe Nikkei 225 saw a modest 0.26% increase, led by the financial sector, as traders awaited key U.S. economic data. However, gains were limited by a higher-than-expected 2.8% rise in Japan’s producer prices, exceeding the 2.3% forecast by economists, which tempered market sentiment. And earnings season continues… JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and BlackRock on Friday. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

The WoW 20th Anniversary introduces a variety of new activities and ways to earn currency during the event which can be used to purchase myriad items including iconic Tier 2 transmog appearance sets. We’ve consulted top goblins and tallied it all up so that you know how to earn these currencies and where you can spend them. Players will also automatically be granted a 10% experience and reputation buff during the Anniversary and can add an additional 10% experience and reputation buff by completing the repeatable “Celebrate Good Fun” quest with Yllana. This buff will not countdown while offline and will be offered to you again once per day when it expires. There are a variety of currencies used at the fairgrounds to purchase armor, armor and weapon appearances, pets, mounts, toys, and more. Here’s what you should make sure you have on hand to spend on all the goodies. During the Anniversary, players will be able to earn anywhere from 1 to 3 Bronze Celebration Tokens per activity over the course of the event each week. Quests and activities can be completed on any character in your Warband and will count toward the weekly amount of (Warband Transferable) Tokens your Warband can earn each week. Activity completions are tracked Warband-wide so there’s no need to run the event with multiple characters every week (unless you want to spread the fun among your characters.) Players who collect 100 Tokens over the course of the event will unlock the ability to earn additional Tokens from 20th Anniversary activities. For those who are looking forward to buying all of the Tier 2 sets, take heart. After the first set purchase at 60 Bronze Celebration Tokens you’ll earn the achievement Upgraded Apparel and the second set purchase will lower to a cost of 40 tokens. Purchasing a second set will earn the achievement Classy Dresser which lowers the cost of additional sets to 20 tokens. These sets can be purchased from armor vendor Traeya in the central pavilion. Here are the various activities you can undertake to earn Bronze Celebration Tokens along with Timewarped Badges and Timewarped Relic Coffer Keys: After players collect their first 100 tokens, their Warband will unlock ungated tokens which will drop from the following activities: Now that you know what activities to undertake to earn currency to spend, we’ve rounded up what items you’ll be able to purchase from the various vendors you’ll find at the 20th Anniversary activity grounds. Get Your Tier 2 Armor Appearances From Traeya On the large wooden pavillion in the center of the grounds on Yllana’s right-hand side, you’ll find Traeya who can sell you Tier 2 Armor appearances for Bronze Celebration Tokens. The first set you purchase costs 60 Bronze Celebration Tokens, the second set is discounted to 40 Tokens, and any additional sets purchased are discounted to 20 Tokens each.

The WoW 20th Anniversary introduces a variety of new activities and ways to earn currency during the event which can be used to purchase myriad items including iconic Tier 2 transmog appearance sets. We’ve consulted top goblins and tallied it all up so that you know how to earn these currencies and where you can spend them. Players will also automatically be granted a 10% experience and reputation buff during the Anniversary and can add an additional 10% experience and reputation buff by completing the repeatable “Celebrate Good Fun” quest with Yllana. This buff will not countdown while offline and will be offered to you again once per day when it expires. There are a variety of currencies used at the fairgrounds to purchase armor, armor and weapon appearances, pets, mounts, toys, and more. Here’s what you should make sure you have on hand to spend on all the goodies. During the Anniversary, players will be able to earn anywhere from 1 to 3 Bronze Celebration Tokens per activity over the course of the event each week. Quests and activities can be completed on any character in your Warband and will count toward the weekly amount of (Warband Transferable) Tokens your Warband can earn each week. Activity completions are tracked Warband-wide so there’s no need to run the event with multiple characters every week (unless you want to spread the fun among your characters.) Players who collect 100 Tokens over the course of the event will unlock the ability to earn additional Tokens from 20th Anniversary activities. For those who are looking forward to buying all of the Tier 2 sets, take heart. After the first set purchase at 60 Bronze Celebration Tokens you’ll earn the achievement Upgraded Apparel and the second set purchase will lower to a cost of 40 tokens. Purchasing a second set will earn the achievement Classy Dresser which lowers the cost of additional sets to 20 tokens. These sets can be purchased from armor vendor Traeya in the central pavilion. Here are the various activities you can undertake to earn Bronze Celebration Tokens along with Timewarped Badges and Timewarped Relic Coffer Keys: After players collect their first 100 tokens, their Warband will unlock ungated tokens which will drop from the following activities: Now that you know what activities to undertake to earn currency to spend, we’ve rounded up what items you’ll be able to purchase from the various vendors you’ll find at the 20th Anniversary activity grounds. Get Your Tier 2 Armor Appearances From Traeya On the large wooden pavillion in the center of the grounds on Yllana’s right-hand side, you’ll find Traeya who can sell you Tier 2 Armor appearances for Bronze Celebration Tokens. The first set you purchase costs 60 Bronze Celebration Tokens, the second set is discounted to 40 Tokens, and any additional sets purchased are discounted to 20 Tokens each.

Title: The China Stocks Sell-Off: What The Price Charts Show Now

Hong Kong, Macau It’s a classic case of “too much, too fast,” and it unfolds on a more or less regular basis in the investment world. Despite their MBAs and statistics PhDs, money managers get caught up in the craze of buying and then they have to keep up with their peers to make sure they don’t underperform and then the buying gets even nuttier. The sell-off this week in China stocks fits the pattern: last week Beijing authorities announced a stimulus plan that included the most loved factor anywhere: cuts in interest rates. China-related and China-curious stocks took off higher for days and now reason and adjusted algorithms kick in again. The iShares China Large-Cap ETF: iShares China Large-Cap ETF daily price chart, 10 10 24. This New York Stock Exchange-listed fund contains the top 50 big caps among China-based securities that can be found on the Hong Kong exchange. The Blackrock ETF gives investors a chance to diversify in the sector rather than take chances with just a single stock or two. The fund holds, for example, Alibaba Group Holding, Meituan, TenCent Holdings, China Construction Bank and JD.Com Class A. The price-earnings ratio for the ETF is 14.30, significantly lower than that of the S&P 500 which has a Shiller p/e of 37.22. The iShares China Large-Cap ETF pays a 2.18% 12-month trailing dividend yield. Alibaba Group Holding. Alibaba Group Holding daily price chart, 10 10 24. This is the internet retail company founded by Jack Ma in 1999 with headquarters in Hangzhou. Market capitalization is $265 billion. The stock hits the high end of the value range for the fund’s holdings with a p/e of 28. Alibaba pays a .90% dividend. The daily price chart above shows that it’s actually held on a little better than the iShares China Large-Cap ETF. The stock is now bouncing a bit after the earlier-in-the week sell-off. Las Vegas Sands. Las Vegas Sands daily price chart, 10 10 24. The Sin City casino/resort company has significant properties in Macau and because of that, the stock’s been trading as if it’s a China stock. This is apparent if you simply compare the Las Vegas Sands chart to the Alibaba or the China ETF charts. Trump supporter Miriam Adelson, wife of the late CEO Sheldon Adelson, holds 56% of the stock float. Wynn Resorts. Wynn Resorts daily price chart, 10 10 24. This is another of the U. S.-based casino/resort companies holding large operations in Macau and so, the price charts show how much it trades like Alibaba and the other big Hong Kong securities. WYNN has a market cap of $11.62 billion. You can see the pattern on the daily price chart above: by late September, buyers anticipating an economic stimulus package began taking a liking to the stock and when the actual interest rates-plus announcement arrived, WYNN hit nearly $108. The sell-off took it back down to $100 and it’s been bouncing since then. Full disclosure: when I was News Director of KLUC-FM in Las Vegas, I interviewed Steve Wynn and met with Elaine Wynn. Steve’s no longer involved with the company but Elaine still holds more WYNN shares than anyone else, last I heard. I counted the cards at the Golden Nugget, which they owned then, and lost money doing so. No artificial intelligence was used in the writing of this piece.

Title: DigitalBridge Group, Inc. (DBRG) Expands AI Data Center Focus as Verizon Signs $3.3 Billion Tower Deal with Vertical Bridge

We recently compiled a list of the 35 AI News You Should Not Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where DigitalBridge Group, Inc. (NYSE:DBRG) stands against the other AI stocks you should not miss. The AI industry is constantly evolving and investors are keeping a close eye on investments, advancements in AI capabilities, and new partnerships to keep pace with the continued rise of generative AI and integration into key industries. One of the most exciting developments in the field of AI over the past week has been the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics, which was awarded to scientists John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton for their pioneering work in the field of machine learning. Hopfield, a researcher at Princeton University, gained recognition for developing an associative memory system, a neural network model capable of storing and reconstructing images or other data patterns. His work revolutionized how data patterns can be represented and recalled, marking significant progress in the field of artificial intelligence. Meanwhile, Hinton, a professor at the University of Toronto, pioneered a method for autonomously discovering data properties, enabling machines to perform tasks such as identifying specific elements within images. His contributions have been pivotal in advancing AI capacity for image recognition and pattern identification. Another notable report worthy of mention is a recent Reuters study into the funding that AI startups have attracted so far this year. The study highlights the $6.6 billion funding round for AI startup OpenAI recently that pushed the valuation of the company to more than $157 billion. It also spotlights other AI startups that have received more than $500 million in funding this year. These include xAI, CoreWeave, Scale AI, Figure AI, Groq, Mistral AI, and Cohere. They have raised $6 billion, $1.1 billion, $1 billion, $657 million, $640 million, $600 million, and $500 million in funding so far this year, respectively. The startups are all valued at more than $2.5 billion, with xAI, founded by Tesla chief Elon Musk, worth over $24 billion. A recent report by Goldman Sachs reveals that businesses worldwide are projected to spend nearly $1 trillion in the coming years on building AI infrastructure. The report underscores the massive scale of investment needed to meet the growing demand for AI technologies across various industries. In 2024 alone, venture capital firms have already completed around 200 deals with AI companies, pouring in nearly $22 billion in funding. The average size of these funding rounds exceeds $100 million, reflecting the increasing valuation of AI startups, which now often surpass $1 billion.

Our Methodology For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

(NYSE:DBRG) is an infrastructure investment firm specializing in digital infrastructure assets. One of the company's key focuses is data centers, which are essential for the AI sector. These data centers support the storage and processing needs of AI workloads, which require vast computational power. Communications firm Verizon recently signed an agreement with Florida-based communications infrastructure operator Vertical Bridge, which is majorly owned by DBRG, for it to exclusively operate and manage 6,339 wireless communications towers across the US for the telecom company under a $3.3 billion deal. The deal is structured as a prepaid lease with $2.8 billion paid upfront in cash and also includes certain commercial benefits, according to a joint statement from both parties. The move will aid the wireless carrier's efforts to expand network footprint while reducing expenses. Overall DBRG ranks 33rd on our list of the AI stocks you should not miss.

Title: Indigenous groups in Brazil: We were not consulted on carbon credits

(This Oct. 9 story has been corrected to remove a reference to BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) as they are not part of this deal, in paragraph 7) By Anthony Boadle BRASILIA (Reuters) - Indigenous organizations in the Brazilian state of Para said they were not consulted by the government before it signed a deal with multinational companies to sell carbon offset credits to support conservation of the Amazon rainforest in the state. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and other firms agreed last month to buy carbon credits valued at $180 million through the LEAF Coalition conservation initiative, which it helped set up in 2021 with a group of companies and governments, including the United States and United Kingdom. At the time, Para Governor Helder Barbalho said the deal had the participation of Indigenous peoples and traditional communities. But on Tuesday, 38 Indigenous and community organizations from Para signed a public letter denouncing his failure to consult them. "It is unacceptable for the government of Para to take decisions without consulting traditional communities, who are the greatest protectors of the forests while also being the most impacted by the lack of effective climate adaptation policies," they said in the letter. "Forest peoples must be heard and consulted. Our territories are not for sale," they said. Alessandra Korap Munduruku, a tribal leader who was the letter's principal author, said the role of U.S.-based companies like Amazon and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) in the carbon credit purchase was worrying. "Our priority is the eviction of invaders on our reservation lands that are threatened by miners and a grain railway," she told Reuters by telephone. "Our leaders were never consulted on the carbon credits. We are being sold like goods." The governor's office did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Korap Munduruku is an Indigenous teacher turned community leader who won the prestigious Goldman environmental prize in 2023 for her efforts to convince mining companies leave Munduruku lands. The agreement is LEAF's first deal in the Amazon, the world's largest rainforest, which is vital to curbing climate change because of the enormous amount of greenhouse gas its trees absorb. The deal foresees the purchase of up to 12 million tons of carbon credits generated by reducing deforestation in Para between 2023 and 2026. It was announced on Sept. 24 during New York Climate Week. Each of the credits represents a reduction of 1 metric ton of carbon emissions and they are jurisdictional, so Para gets paid for reducing deforestation across the state, including on public lands like reservations. Governor Barbalho said the state would only collect the portion of the sales' proceeds needed to continue its efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions, while the rest would go to Indigenous peoples and traditional communities as well as family farms. Para will host the UN COP30 climate summit next year, in a move that is the centerpiece of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's bid to restore Brazil's environmental credentials after years of soaring deforestation.

On a special episode (first released on October 9, 2024) of The Excerpt podcast: From Gen Z to the Silent Generation, Americans are approaching building their nest egg in vastly different ways. Boomers feel unprepared, while Gen Xers worry they're behind schedule, and Millennials – who are navigating student loan debt on top of rising housing, child care and education costs – are feeling the squeeze. USA TODAY Personal Finance Reporter Daniel de Visé and Money Reporter Bailey Schulz join The Excerpt to share their findings in this first of four specials exploring how different generations are handling life’s pressure points. Hit play on the player below to hear the podcast and follow along with the transcript beneath it. This transcript was automatically generated, and then edited for clarity in its current form. There may be some differences between the audio and the text. Podcasts: True crime, in-depth interviews and more USA TODAY podcasts right here Dana Taylor: Hello, and welcome to The Excerpt. I'm Dana Taylor. Today is Wednesday, October 9th, 2024, and this is a special episode of The Excerpt. From prep to panic, retirement expectations in America have become, well, complicated and differs greatly by generation. While Boomers are anxious about having enough put away to finally get out of the rat race, Gen Z is said to be healthy savers ahead of their time. Can understanding the lens through which we talk about retirement help us plan for and navigate this phase of our lives more successfully? To dive into the issues here, I'm joined now by USA TODAY finance reporters Daniel de Visé and Bailey Schulz, part of a network-wide team exploring how generational divides define our thinking on and approach to various cultural facets of life. Daniel, Bailey, thanks for joining me on The Excerpt. Bailey Schulz: Thank you for having us. Dana Taylor: Bailey, I want to start with you here. Before the Boomers who are currently in the process of retiring en masse, there was the Silent Generation, a generation who largely was able to enjoy retirement on generous pension plans provided by the places they worked for 30, 40, 50 years. Then American companies sort of pulled the plug on offering pension plans. How did this generational change impact how Boomers planned for their retirement? Bailey Schulz: Yeah, so like you said, we saw this shift away from pensions toward 401(k)s in the 1980s. I think that has really affected these trends within the generations and how they are saving for retirement. So there was a recent report from Morningstar that found that that sort of shift has left Baby Boomers and Gen X with just less time to accumulate savings for retirement. Dana Taylor: Bailey, the COVID pandemic happened at a critical time for many workers, but especially Boomers, who were hoping to retire relatively soon and then suddenly many were forced out of the workforce early. Have you found that they've mostly recovered? Bailey Schulz: So there was a recent survey by Goldman Sachs, and they found that as for Boomers, about half feel behind on their savings and half say that part-time work will be important to their retirement income strategy. And so that's what we found in our reporting where I spoke to Baby Boomer who is planning to retire within two years, but she will be taking on work here and there when she can. Same with her husband. And so yeah, I think that is just the approach that we're seeing quite a bit of Baby Boomers take to get themselves through retirement. Dana Taylor: Daniel, a lot of Gen Xers had their retirement plans also scuttled by the pandemic. Many in their forties and fifties were hoping to channel money earned during their peak earning years into retirement savings. How have they been faring? Daniel de Visé: Well, I would say that Generation X has been pummeled by a bunch of different economic crises. I'm a Gen Xer and it's the group that was kind of entering their prime right when the Great Recession hit. So that took an enormous toll in terms of their employment, in terms of them building retirement savings. And a lot of Gen Xers too survived the dot-com bust at the turn of the millennium. For a lot of us, that was when we were first getting into the profession. And then COVID. We haven't seen the stock market just go up, up, up, up like some older people did. And so that's kind of where we're at. I think Gen Xers don't have the same sort of confidence in the economy and in the stock market and in their ability to build savings that maybe older folks did. Dana Taylor: Daniel, are there other unanticipated factors impacting Gen Xers with their retirement plans? Daniel de Visé: Well, I wrote about gray divorce for USA TODAY earlier in the year, and that story went bananas. This is people in their fifties divorcing. What's happening is their kids get out of school and then somebody pulls the trigger on a divorce, and I'm seeing it in my own community and we're seeing it a lot around the country, just older people divorcing. As it happens, two people in our story, they both went through gray divorces, or sort of midlife divorces, and it's particularly ruinous for women, for the spouse who was the wife, basically, because oftentimes traditionally the woman in the partnership is less likely to have earned money consistently during the marriage. And so when the partners divorce, I said this in my article, the woman ends up much worse off financially relative to, the guy doesn't do well either, but the woman does worse. Dana Taylor: Higher socioeconomic status of course plays a big role in how a lot of people across generations plan for retirement. Economically, Boomers had a lot of advantages than other generations, later generations, in terms of interest rates, inflation, housing, the list goes on. Yet some have accused the Boomers of climbing the corporate ladder only to pull it up behind them, preventing younger generation from accessing the same opportunities, including higher paying jobs that would've made retirement planning easier. Daniel, is there any truth to this perception? Daniel de Visé: No, I don't think Boomers pulled up the ladder. Boomers were hippies, a lot of them. I don't think a lot of them were super, super competitive or driven to succeed. I think what happened was home prices have gone just crazy in the last bunch of years, so younger people, especially in the last 10 years, feel crippled in their ability to buy houses. Now, that was something the Boomers were able to do pretty easily. Also, the decline of pensions, which we mentioned earlier in this conversation, that happened during the Boomer Generation. So a lot of Boomers actually do have, I've got a couple of pensions. I'm a Gen Xer. So Boomers actually have it a little easier in terms of it's more likely they have a pension and the younger generations are much less likely to have one. And then again, the Boomers, while they were affected by the Great Recession, it came later in their careers. So researchers have sort of proven that they didn't get hit as hard, the Boomers didn't, by the Great Recession. The younger folks, the Gen Xers and the Millennials, were the ones who were really buffeted by that. Dana Taylor: Some of the challenges we're talking about really come down to dealing with unexpected shifts, the Great Recession, the pandemic, now the worry about AI making many jobs obsolete. Bailey and then Daniel, I'd like you both to talk about how you see resilience playing out generationally. Bailey, I'll start with you. Bailey Schulz: So one thing that jumped out to me was just the trends that we're seeing among Gen Z, the young generation who's just really starting to dip their toes into retirement savings. And what they told me is that they're really learning from previous generations and seeing what they faced with the Great Recession, with the pandemic, and starting to really wanting to lean into savings early to prevent some of those financial hardships. And so as far as where that generation stands, we see one study from BlackRock that cites the Gen Z generations as a group of savers ahead of their time. And so I think that's what we're seeing as a trend with that sort of younger group of savers. Dana Taylor: And Daniel, what are your thoughts here? Daniel de Visé: Well, I think the resilience of the younger generation derives from this hardship I was talking about. Again, the Gen Xers, like myself, we went through the Great Recession, we went earlier through the dot-com bubble, and we've been through COVID. So we and the generations beneath us, the Millennials, I think that makes us more resilient. Again, we don't expect the stock market to go up by exactly 10% every single year. We expect it to go down and sometimes for three, four years in a row. I think that very fact makes us more resilient. I did an article recently about how the youngins, they look into these alternative investments. They're not even necessarily investing in traditional stocks. There are these crypto millionaires. They're investing in individual companies based on what they think is progressive sort of corporate policies. So they have a sort of a outside the box way of thinking that probably the Boomers don't have. And then just the other thing would be, because of COVID, the really young folks are kind of coming of age in this era when you move to Boise, Idaho, or one of these COVID boom towns, you've learned that your career can be mobile. You can pick up and move anywhere around the country. I think there's a real strength to that for the younger people. They're sort of arriving into the prime of their careers knowing that they could kind of live anywhere and have this really adaptable sort of approach to both working and parenting. I feel envious of them because my wife and I are really stuck in this old way of thinking that we're used to commuting and we couldn't just move. So we are here in D.C. But it's amazing to think you could go move to Las Vegas where Bailey is or anywhere and live your life there and work your job. Dana Taylor: We haven't talked a lot about Millennials yet. Daniel, many are worried about them from a retirement perspective that they really aren't prepared. What have you found? Daniel de Visé: Report after report show Millennials suffered just as Gen Xers did through the Great Recession. So they started out way behind, right? And so when you look at these retirement surveys, it shows the Millennials playing catch-up, but they're doing a good job of it. I would say that since the Great Recession, which is now, what, 12 years, they've done a admirable job of saving. Their sort of marginal rate of retirement saving is pretty darn good. They don't get a hundred percent of the credit for this. Companies are much more likely to auto enroll you in a 401(k) now, so you may not even think about it and lo and behold, you're invested in retirement savings with your money in an index fund. As for the Millennials, the other thing is they've benefited from this booming housing market in the last several years. Millennials bought their first homes during this huge run-up in value. So lo and behold, their property's worth half again more than it was when they bought it, and they're thrilled about this. No group I would say maybe has benefited more than Millennials in terms of just getting this lift from the housing market in the last several years. Dana Taylor: Bailey, how is student debt playing a role in how the generations view and plan for retirement? Bailey Schulz: Yeah, I think that is a big one, especially for Millennials and Gen Xers, some of whom are still paying off loans at this point. I've seen surveys find that about half of those generations say that paying down loans is a major financial goal. And even more saying that paying down loans like student loans are affecting their ability to save for retirement. So I spoke to one Gen Xer for the story who wasn't able to pay off her student loans until she was in her forties. And so for people in this generation, a lot of times that is debt that is just lingering and really taking away money that could have been going towards their retirement savings. Dana Taylor: In thinking about how various generations approach and plan for retirement, what surprised you the most? Daniel, let's start with you. Daniel de Visé: I would say that the two women I interviewed who are close to my age and generation, what really surprised me about them both was they divorced not too, too long ago and were really starting from zero. And both of them have recovered amazingly, to the point where I believe they're both now more or less on track to retire with some kind of nest egg. And that just blew me away because imagine your marriage falling apart and you find out there was way less than you thought there was saved up or coming your way in the divorce and you're starting from nothing. And then not too many years later, because these women are both very smart and very hardworking and have worked with financial planners, and lo and behold, they are more or less on track. And that really amazed me and made me really happy because there's a lot of people out there who have to start over again, maybe in the middle of their careers, in the middle of their lives, especially after a gray divorce. And it was just really heartening to see two really happy endings to that what could otherwise have been a really sort of life-altering event, basically. Dana Taylor: And then, Bailey, what surprised you the most? Bailey Schulz: I think for a story like this, there's always a mixed bag of what you see with retirement savings, where some people are really struggling to catch up, some are on top of it. But I was surprised by how optimistic I was by the end, especially for those younger generations where I spoke to 19-year-olds who already have Roth IRAs and are putting in money towards retirement. And that's nothing that me or my Millennial friends did back in the day when we were in college. And so I think we're seeing this younger generation of savers who have these resources and financial education materials available and are taking the time to do their research and invest and plan for the future, which is really heartening to see. I spoke to one who is putting away about a quarter of his pretax income into retirement and hoping to retire before the age of 50. And so you have this younger generation that has really narrowed in on retirement savings and setting up for their future. I think that was exciting to see. Dana Taylor: Daniel and Bailey, thank you so much for taking the time to talk to us. Daniel de Visé: Thank you. Bailey Schulz: Thank you.

Title: 400 Billion Reasons To Believe In Brain-Computer Interfaces
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/naveenrao/2024/10/10/400-billion-reasons-to-believe-in-brain-computer-interfaces/
Time Published: 2024-10-10T16:09:15Z
Full Content:
Morgan Stanley’s latest report pegs the BCI market at $400 billion in the US alone. “Brain Computer Interface Primer: The Next Big MedTech Opportunity?” by the bank’s equity analysts provides timely research, signaling to investors that this emerging frontier holds potential to generate substantial returns in future decades. This 37-page report includes a commercial history, industry landscape and deep dives into eight ... [+] major market segments for early and intermediate adoption of BCI through 2045. Note: As of publishing this article, Morgan Stanley’s 37-page report appears unlinked to a dedicated url, but the PDF has been circulating the commercial corridors of neurotech networks. This article is not the report. I’ll update this article with a dedicated link if I find one; If you are unable to access the file, just reach out. In addition to a brief summary of BCI’s origins and commercial history, the report covers key topics related to medical device outlook and ends with some speculation about the more distant future of this technology. But in a word, it’s about the TAM. Investors and commercial leaders should understand the rationale behind the Total Attainable Market before they choose to believe it or not. The assumptions and fine print driving the analysis are the GPS for navigating BCI investment today more than any singular estimate. Here’s what you need to know: An important caveat: Topline estimates only captures “potential revenue from a single implant procedure, ignoring a potential replacement cycle and likely recurring revenues from software.” Curiously, while they cross-reference their BCI estimates against other implanted neurotech markets like “spinal cord stimulation ($2bn annual run rate), sacral neuromodulation ($1bn annual run rate), and hypoglossal nerve stimulation ($800mn annual run rate),” they leave out deep brain stimulation from their comparisons. "Cost components of DBS surgery. Cost of DBS device, surgery, total cost of surgery, and total cost ... [+] of treatment." Sidebar: I suspect this was not an oversight, but rather an attempt to avoid undermining their own bullish outlook by analyzing an implanted brain device that has failed to cross $2b in run rate; as Schalk et al wrote earlier this year, “30 years after the introduction of DBS, only less than 3% of patients with Parkinson disease receive a DBS implant.” For sake of understanding this close proxy market however, I dug up recent average US DBS costs from Bishay et al’s 2024 Review. In that paper, the chart to the left is followed by another chart that reveals how DBS costs vary by indication, from Parkinson’s to Essential Tremor or Dystonia. This variability underscores that no medical device is a monolith, and hints at the complexity of neurotechnology pricing and reimbursement strategy. BCI costs will prove highly heterogeneous, between incomparable device designs, surgical approaches, clinical protocols, intended functionality, and much more. Morgan Stanley’s report reflects this across various market segment analyses, but the authors keep the math simple with a low tier and high tier pricepoint. Let’s dive in. Authors segment BCI into broad categories of product and market, and defining and sizing immediate and follow-on markets for each. There are some limitations inherent to any market research of this scope which we’ll touch on at the end. While the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services will need to determine appropriate coverage (reimbursement), they offer some ballpark estimates for sake of calculation: The cross sections between “Enable/Prevent” and “Early/Intermediate,” makes the analysis a little byzantine, but the math really comes down to which people will have skin in the game. Morgan Stanley's estimates for immediate BCI applications across 8 clinical indications Eight major market segments each feature an estimated population analysis that includes sizing rationale for both early-stage and intermediate-stage applications. A summary of the former suggests a near-term TAM of $80.8 billion (see above). The latter comprises a larger follow-on market opportunity worth up to $320 billion. Some key assumptions and estimates behind the larger, intermediate TAM figures: As a note, the above three areas are fairly well established in the BCI industry, with Synchron, Neuralink, and Blackrock in active clinical trials, with Precision and Paradromics set to join them following FDA Breakthrough designations last year. While the authors suggest additional indications like ADHD, OCD, anxiety could become BCI markets, they stop short of scoping these opportunities in this analysis. Beyond the above analysis, the report also explores eligible population growth projections, timelines for ramp up, penetration rates, and sales estimates on the early/intermediate rationale defined above for each condition. It’s tidy yet squishy math that doesn’t summarize neatly. After spending a day poring through these numbers and a year studying this market, here are parting thoughts for executives keen on digesting this report to inform their go-to-market strategy in BCI.

Saba Capital's recent purchases of BlackRock Innovation & Growth Term Trust (NYSE:BIGZ) shares align with some intriguing financial metrics and insights from InvestingPro. As of the latest data, BIGZ boasts a substantial dividend yield of 13.6%, with the most recent ex-dividend date on September 16, 2024. This high yield supports one of the InvestingPro Tips, which notes that BIGZ "pays a significant dividend to shareholders." The trust's current market capitalization stands at $1.71 billion, with a price-to-earnings ratio of 7.87, suggesting a potentially undervalued position relative to its earnings. This valuation metric may have factored into Saba Capital's decision to increase its stake. BIGZ has shown positive price performance across various timeframes, with a 19.06% total return over the past year and a 12.5% return year-to-date. The stock is currently trading at 92.36% of its 52-week high, indicating recent strength in its market position. However, investors should be aware of potential challenges. InvestingPro Tips also highlight that BIGZ "suffers from weak gross profit margins" and its "valuation implies a poor free cash flow yield." These factors may explain why the trust trades at a seemingly attractive P/E ratio despite its high dividend yield. For those interested in a deeper analysis, InvestingPro offers additional tips and metrics that could provide further context to Saba Capital's investment strategy in BIGZ.

Title: Key DeFi service Uniswap launches its own blockchain
URL: https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/10/10/key-defi-service-uniswap-launches-its-own-blockchain/
Time Published: 2024-10-10T13:40:51Z

Uniswap Labs, the corporate entity that builds products to use the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol of the same name, announced on Thursday the launch of a so-called layer 2 blockchain. The new blockchain is called Unichain and, according to the company, will significantly speed up the time it takes to carry out transactions on its decentralized exchange. “Unichain will initially have one-second block times, and will later be optimized to meet 200–250 milliseconds block times. This will feel like a near-instant transaction experience for the user,” said Uniswap Labs in a statement. Layer 2 blockchains, knowns as L2s, have proliferated in the last few years and include services like Arbitrum and Coinbase’s Base. They work by compiling transactions and recording them as a batch onto the main Ethereum blockchain, a process that minimizes fees and avoids delays due to congestion. The decision by Uniswap Labs to launch an L2 of its own is significant because Uniswap—an open-source protocol akin to SMTP for email—is the most popular tool for DeFi, which relies on modular, Lego-like tools to carry out trades without a centralized authority. Using the email analogy, Unichain is like Gmail or another client built on the open protocol. In an interview with Fortune, Uniswap Labs COO Mary-Catherine Lader said Unichain will in time make using DeFi less clunky for users and also increase liquidity across the industry. A former banker with BlackRock and Goldman Sachs, Lader predicts DeFi-style tools will increasingly be adopted by the world of traditional finance. According to Lader, Uniswap Labs built Unichain with a mind for the Apple adage that building great software requires great hardware, and the company’s philosophy is based on simultaneously pursuing the crypto ideals of speed, low cost, and decentralization. Unichain itself is built on the L2 technology known as Optimism, which is used by a popular L2 of the same name and by Base, among others. Uniswap was created in 2018 by self-taught programmer Hayden Adams, who has since developed a second and third version of the protocol. In late 2022, Uniswap Labs raised a $165 million Series B funding round that at the time valued it around the same amount. Uniswap created the new L2 blockchain with the help of the DeFi research and development organizations Flashbots and OP Labs. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: China markets follow U.S. rise with lift from new Beijing stimulus optimism
URL: https://fortune.com/2024/10/10/premarket-stock-futures-dow-sp500-nasdaq-13/
Time Published: 2024-10-10T09:27:19Z
Full Content:
Shares in mainland China rebounded as traders found renewed optimism for more stimulus measures. Traders around the word awaited U.S. inflation data for September—and the implications it will have for rate cuts at the Federal Reserve’s November meeting. China: Hong Kong and Shanghai rise on stimulus optimism rebound A day after China’s mainland shares took a steep dive, Shanghai’s SSE Composite rose 1.32%, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng jumped another 2.98% as stimulus optimism returned. Markets were aided by Beijing’s announcement that its finance minister will give another stimulus briefing on Saturday, at which investors expect more measures to boost the economy. Japan: Nikkei posts small rise as producer prices rise more than expected The Nikkei 225 hovered near breakeven, posting a minimal 0.26% rise with the financial sector leading the way, as traders awaited the release of U.S. before the bell in New York. The mood was tempered by producer prices, which increased 2.8%, above the 2.3% expected by economists. Europe: Shares waver ahead of U.S. CPI as GSK soars on court settlement European stocks slid slightly early Thursday as traders there also prepared for the release of U.S inflation data. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 was down a marginal 0.09% in early trading, saved from steeper losses by an over 5% surge in GSK over news that the pharma giant had reached a $2.2 billion deal to settle thousands of claims in U.S. courts that linked cancer cases to its heartburn drug Zantac. The STOXX Europe 600 was down 0.21%. U.S. premarket slips with inflation numbers in focus A day after all three markets posted ample rises—and the Dow and S&P 500 both set fresh records—the main U.S. indexes were all down slightly in premarket trading Thursday. Investors awaited the pre-market release of September CPI inflation numbers, which will have implications for the Fed’s plans to cut interest rates—or not—in November. On Wednesday, cruise lines saw their shares surge as oil prices dropped, with Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings leading the pack with a 10.91% gain. The announcement that the DOJ might push to split up Google weighed on owner Alphabet—which dropped 1.59%—and the tech-heavy Nasdaq. And earnings season continues… Delta Air Lines reports today, and JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and BlackRock on Friday. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: BlackRock holds out during $49.2 million in Bitcoin ETF outflow amid Ethereum ghost town

Ark's ARKB ETF leads Bitcoin outflows as BlackRock's IBIT remains an exception. On Oct. 8, 2024, Bitcoin ETFs saw net outflows totaling $18.6 million. Fidelity’s FBTC ETF led the declines with $48.8 million in outflows, while Grayscale’s GBTC ETF recorded a smaller outflow of $9.4 million. BlackRock’s IBIT ETF was the only notable inflow, adding $39.6 million. Other major ETFs reported no significant activity, including those from Ark, Bitwise, Invesco, Franklin, Valkyrie, VanEck, and WisdomTree. By Oct. 9, the outflows continued with a total net loss of $30.6 million. Ark’s ARKB ETF led the day’s outflows, losing $44.5 million, while BlackRock’s IBIT ETF recorded a modest inflow of $13.9 million. No inflows or outflows were reported for Fidelity’s FBTC or other major ETFs, marking a quiet day across the broader Bitcoin ETF market. In Ethereum ETFs, Oct. 8 saw a total outflow of $8.1 million, driven primarily by Fidelity’s FETH ETF, which posted $3.6 million in outflows, and Bitwise’s ETHW ETF, which lost $4.5 million. Other Ethereum ETFs, including those from BlackRock, 21Shares, VanEck, Invesco, Franklin, and Grayscale, reported no inflows or outflows. On Oct. 9, Ethereum ETFs remained static, with no reported activity across all funds, signaling a pause in investor activity in Ethereum-backed products after the previous day’s outflows. The continued outflows in Bitcoin ETFs over these two days, particularly from Ark and Fidelity, reflect ongoing investor caution. BlackRock’s IBIT ETF remains one of the few funds consistently attracting inflows. Ethereum ETFs, meanwhile, saw limited activity, with modest outflows on Oct. 8 and no significant movement on Oct. 9. This dynamic suggests a broader market consolidation as investors reassess their positions across both Bitcoin and Ethereum assets.

Title: Japan to introduce self-amplifying mRNA COVID-19 vaccine with a 90% adverse event rate, and the U.S. is next in line
URL: https://www.naturalnews.com/2024-10-10-japan-introduce-self-amplifying-mrna-covid-vaccine.html

In clinical trials, a near 90 percent adverse event rate was recorded after the first dose. These adverse events were disregarded, however, as Japan approved the jab. The United States is also looking to approve these jabs in the coming years. Worldâs first self-amplifying mRNA vaccine will be released in Japan ARCT-154 became the worldâs first self-amplifying mRNA COVID-19 vaccine after receiving approval from Japanâs Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare in November 2023. It was developed by biotechnology firm CSL in collaboration with Arcturus Therapeutics. Unlike mRNA vaccines â which only produce the spike protein necessary for immune response as long as the mRNA persists â saRNA vaccines are engineered to create copies of themselves and the proteins they encode. This "biological printing press" could theoretically amplify the vaccineâs presence and multiply its effects within the body indefinitely. According to CSL, the vaccine demonstrated higher immunogenicity and a favorable safety profile compared to original mRNA vaccines during clinical trials. However, independent vaccine researchers are voicing serious concerns regarding the safety and efficacy of this untested technology. Dr. Nicolas Hulscher stated, âThese products are completely new. There is absolutely no long-term safety data on them.â In trials for ARCT-154, he noted a near 90 percent adverse event rate after the first dose, with clinicians observing significant systemic reactions in participants. Serious and medically-attended adverse events were only recorded from Day 1 to Day 92. Karina Acevedo Whitehouse, a microbiology professor, emphasized the lack of comprehensive studies on the long-term effects of self-amplifying mRNA technology. She pointed out that there are no assessments of potential cellular transformations, including the risks of cancerous mutations or inflammatory responses. âWe simply do not know what the consequences could be,â she warned. âThere have also been no studies conducted on trans-generational effects â for instance, teratogenicity [birth defects] â of self-amplifying mRNA injections,â she said. âWe simply do not know what the consequences could be.â Further raising concerns, a Cambridge University study revealed that original mRNA vaccines could trigger unintended immune responses in a third of recipients, leading to possible autoimmune reactions. Whitehouse linked the increase in certain cancers observed since 2021 to the effects of mRNA technology on cellular pathways. Self-amplifying mRNA vaccines, which include an enzyme that allows for the replication of the injected mRNA, may pose even greater risks than the original mRNA vaccines. Experts suggest that the sustained antigen production could lead to heightened risks, making these new vaccines akin to âconventional mRNA injections on steroids,â as Hulscher described. U.S. considers using self-amplifying mRNA vaccines, which are really runaway bioweapons The United States is planning to use these new vaccines. The Biden regime has already partnered with several companies to develop self-amplifying mRNA vaccines for future plandemics. In other words, companies are conspiring to create a line of self-amplifying vaccines so they can profit from future virus constructs and subsequent pandemic messaging and vaccine marketing campaigns. CastleVax, Codagenix and Gritstone Bio have already received contracts from the Department of Health and Human Services under the federal governmentâs Project NextGen. Project NextGen claims to accelerate and streamline the rapid development of the next generation of vaccines and treatments by spearheading public-private collaborations. In September of 2023, Gritstone Bio locked in a $433 million contract to simply âconduct a mid-stage study of its self -amplifying mRNA COVID-19 vaccine candidate,â so there have been products in development for some time. Gritstone Bio has previously received funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which seeks to capitalize on their vaccine investments. Gritstone Bioâs partners also include BlackRock and State Street, official partners of the World Economic Forum. These bioweapon investments are too-big-to-fail, and the courts are not holding vaccine manufacturers accountable for harming millions, so it's likely that saRNA vaccines will be coming to the U.S. soon.

CastleVax, Codagenix and Gritstone Bio have already received contracts from the Department of Health and Human Services under the federal governmentâs Project NextGen. Project NextGen claims to accelerate and streamline the rapid development of the next generation of vaccines and treatments by spearheading public-private collaborations. In September of 2023, Gritstone Bio locked in a $433 million contract to simply âconduct a mid-stage study of its self -amplifying mRNA COVID-19 vaccine candidate,â so there have been products in development for some time. Gritstone Bio has previously received funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which seeks to capitalize on their vaccine investments. Gritstone Bioâs partners also include BlackRock and State Street, official partners of the World Economic Forum. These bioweapon investments are too-big-to-fail, and the courts are not holding vaccine manufacturers accountable for harming millions, so it's likely that saRNA vaccines will be coming to the U.S. soon. Sources include: ChildrensHealthDefense.org WhiteHouse.gov Nature.com Worldâs first self-amplifying mRNA vaccine will be released in Japan ARCT-154 became the worldâs first self-amplifying mRNA COVID-19 vaccine after receiving approval from Japanâs Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare in November 2023. It was developed by biotechnology firm CSL in collaboration with Arcturus Therapeutics. Unlike mRNA vaccines â which only produce the spike protein necessary for immune response as long as the mRNA persists â saRNA vaccines are engineered to create copies of themselves and the proteins they encode. This "biological printing press" could theoretically amplify the vaccineâs presence and multiply its effects within the body indefinitely. According to CSL, the vaccine demonstrated higher immunogenicity and a favorable safety profile compared to original mRNA vaccines during clinical trials. However, independent vaccine researchers are voicing serious concerns regarding the safety and efficacy of this untested technology. Dr. Nicolas Hulscher stated, âThese products are completely new. There is absolutely no long-term safety data on them.â In trials for ARCT-154, he noted a near 90 percent adverse event rate after the first dose, with clinicians observing significant systemic reactions in participants. Serious and medically-attended adverse events were only recorded from Day 1 to Day 92. Karina Acevedo Whitehouse, a microbiology professor, emphasized the lack of comprehensive studies on the long-term effects of self-amplifying mRNA technology. She pointed out that there are no assessments of potential cellular transformations, including the risks of cancerous mutations or inflammatory responses. âWe simply do not know what the consequences could be,â she warned. âThere have also been no studies conducted on trans-generational effects â for instance, teratogenicity [birth defects] â of self-amplifying mRNA injections,â she said. âWe simply do not know what the consequences could be.â Further raising concerns, a Cambridge University study revealed that original mRNA vaccines could trigger unintended immune responses in a third of recipients, leading to possible autoimmune reactions. Whitehouse linked the increase in certain cancers observed since 2021 to the effects of mRNA technology on cellular pathways. Self-amplifying mRNA vaccines, which include an enzyme that allows for the replication of the injected mRNA, may pose even greater risks than the original mRNA vaccines. Experts suggest that the sustained antigen production could lead to heightened risks, making these new vaccines akin to âconventional mRNA injections on steroids,â as Hulscher described.

Title: Big tech is bringing nuclear power back to life

One of the two reactors at a nuclear-power plant at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania had suffered an accident. The governor ordered an evacuation of all vulnerable people within five miles of the plant as radioactive gas escaped. In the end, the accident resulted in no injuries or loss of life. Two decades later, The Economist visited the Pennsylvania hinterlands and found the second, unproblematic reactor still running well and enjoying strong local support. It cranked out power until it was mothballed in 2019 owing not to safety concerns but to competition from cheap shale gas. Now Three Mile Island is coming back from the dead. On September 20th Microsoft, a tech giant, and Constellation Energy, the utility that decommissioned the trouble-free reactor, signed a deal to return it to service. The utility will spend about $1.6bn to restore the plant by 2028. Microsoft will then buy its carbon-free power for the next 20 years. Having plunged through the 1990s and 2000s, the share of global nuclear power generated by new plants is now rising again (see chart 1). Although America is home to 94 conventional nuclear reactors, about a fifth of the world’s total, it has built few in recent decades. There are, however, over five dozen nuclear reactors under construction worldwide, mostly in China and Russia but increasingly in other places, too (see chart 2). In July, for instance, the Czech Republic finalised plans for a $17bn nuclear project. And interest in small modular reactors (SMRs), which are cheaper and quicker to build, is surging everywhere. A new age for nuclear power may be dawning. Demand from tech giants such as Microsoft, Amazon and Google, all of which are racing to find sufficient clean power to feed the data centres underpinning the artificial-intelligence (AI) boom, is turbocharging the nuclear revival. Brad Smith, president of Microsoft, explains that even before AI came along, his firm’s promise to remove more greenhouse gases from the atmosphere than it has contributed during its entire history was ambitious. Now, thanks to AI, he reckons Microsoft will consume five to six times as much electricity by 2030 as it anticipated when it set the goal in 2020. Nuclear power is well suited to data centres because it provides a reliable source of clean energy around the clock, unlike wind and solar, notes David Victor of the University of California at San Diego. The vast scale of nuclear-power plants also makes them attractive: running an AI data centre can require as much as a gigawatt (GW) of power. That could be provided by millions of solar panels—or just a single nuclear-power plant. Unfortunately, there are few decommissioned nuclear reactors in America, Europe and Japan that would be suitable for big tech to resurrect. New plants will therefore need to be built. These projects absorb enormous amounts of capital and are sensitive to interest-rate fluctuations and long delays. What is more, the risk of overruns is higher today because the supply chains and expertise needed to build nuclear power have atrophied, at least outside China and Russia. A case in point is the recently opened Vogtle nuclear plant in Georgia, America’s first in decades. It cost $35bn, more than double the initial estimate, and was completed seven years late. One way for tech giants to mitigate the risk is to bring in outside investors. Last month Microsoft teamed up with BlackRock, an asset manager, and other investors to launch a $30bn infrastructure fund devoted to AI. Mr Smith, who says the fund’s firepower could rise to $100bn once debt is added, expects it to finance nuclear projects, among other things. He also expects three or four such funds led by other tech firms to emerge, and suggests that Microsoft “may participate in all of them". At the same time, tech titans have taken a growing interest in SMRs. Currently there are only two in operation, in China and Russia. But Western manufacturers of power equipment such as GE Vernova and Rolls Royce have been busily developing models of them, as have numerous startups. TerraPower, an SMR startup backed by Bill Gates, broke ground on its first plant in Wyoming in August. Oklo, another startup which counts Sam Altman, the boss of OpenAI, among its backers, intends to deploy several small nuclear plants by 2030. Earlier this year it signed an agreement to provide Equinix, a data-centre operator, with 500 megawatts of nuclear power that includes a prepayment that should help it fund construction. There are more SMRs planned or under construction in America than anywhere else in the world, thanks in large part to enthusiasm from the tech industry. Last month Oracle, a software giant, unveiled plans for a GW-scale data centre to be powered by three SMRs for which the firm has already secured permits. On October 3rd Sundar Pichai, the boss of Google, confirmed that his firm is also looking into SMRs to power its data centres. Chain reactionStill, the technology behind SMRs remains unproven at scale. Meanwhile, the hefty and uncertain price tag of building conventional nuclear-power plants will continue to weigh on the industry’s growth—and big tech’s hopes of powering the AI revolution without spewing vast amounts of carbon into the atmosphere. Chris Womack, the chief executive of the Southern Company, which owns the nuclear plant in Georgia, reckons that public support would help. “The government must provide some cost-overrun insurance," he argues. Streamlining lengthy permitting processes would be even better. Governments certainly seem to be warming towards nuclear power, after decades of frostiness. At an event held during UN Climate Week in New York last month, officials lined up to reaffirm a commitment made by over 20 countries at the cop climate summit in Dubai last year to triple the global output of nuclear power by 2050. Fourteen big banks also said they are ready to finance new nuclear projects. Pointing to the surge in demand from AI, Mohamed Al Hammadi, head of the Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation, declared: “We have witnessed a step change in momentum across the nuclear sector." For it to continue, a mix of technical ingenuity, financial wizardry and supportive policy will be needed. Still, the technology behind SMRs remains unproven at scale.

Title: Bitcoin ETF Inflows Jump To $235 Million – Is The Bull Market Heating Up?

Bitcoin’s exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are once again generating headlines due to an extraordinary increase in inflows. An investment of $235.2 million in Bitcoin ETFs occurred on October 8, indicating a substantial increase in investor appetite. This surge, based on data from Farside Investors, follows a relatively uneventful beginning to the month, but it indicates a resurgence in investor confidence in the cryptocurrency market. This was led by Fidelity’s Bitcoin ETF (FBTC) with a $103.7 million inflow. iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), managed by BlackRock, received $97.9 million of inflows. Bitwise ETF BITB and ARK Invest ETF Arkb also joined with $13.1 million and $12.6 million respectively. The combined trading volume of all Bitcoin ETFs steadily grew to over a cool $1.22 billion up from just the other day. Given the erratic Bitcoin values, the comeback in ETF inflows is especially remarkable. Bitcoin was trading at roughly $62,485 at the time of writing, somewhat declining from its previous high of $66,000 to show some bearish pressure. Notwithstanding the recent price drop, the strong demand for Bitcoin ETFs shows that institutional investors are ready to profit from possible future increases. Unlike the optimistic sentiment connected with Bitcoin ETFs, Ethereum’s ETFs tell a different story: Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) were on low inflows of $7.4 million on October 6 and had no new activity on October 7. This stagnation is quite different from the active movement within Bitcoin ETFs. Analysts point out that this difference could point to changing investor tastes or worries on Ethereum’s market dynamics. The lack of inflows into Ethereum ETFs brings even more questions about whether, at present, there is any better overall market sentiment toward altcoins. Investor interest in Ethereum has subsided somewhat, as indicated, though the phenomenon of Bitcoin draws enormous volumes of institutional capital. Recent increases in Bitcoin ETF inflows reflect the direction of a larger market trend resulting from conjecture over possible Federal Reserve rate reduction. Many investors think this move will strengthen the market and keep prices on the ascent. If history has anything to teach us, it is that such financial easing usually encourages additional investment in risk assets including cryptocurrency. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas emphasizes that, given the excellent performances of both FBTC and IBIT, they are going to be very important for the future of Bitcoin ETFs. They may even touch “stud level” with over $10 billion in assets under management. And by the end of 2024 in the fourth quarter, this institutional interest is on the rise which may well bring us the bull run. Ethereum’s ETFs are presently experiencing stagnation, despite the fact that Bitcoin ETFs are experiencing a resurgence that is characterized by significant inflows and increased trading volumes. Investors are closely monitoring the market as they prepare for potential changes that may result from evolving market dynamics and changes in monetary policy. As they jointly navigate these turbulent waters, the next few weeks will be critical for both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Featured image from Zerocap, chart from TradingView They say journalists never truly clock out. But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. They say journalists never truly clock out. But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.
