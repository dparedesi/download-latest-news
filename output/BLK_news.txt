By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor Howard Lutnick, President Trump’s Commerce Secretary, said TikTok will go dark for the video app’s millions of American users unless China agrees by a Sept. 17 deadline to a deal that will give the U.S. owners majority control over the app. “We’ve made the decision. You can’t have Chinese control and have something on 100 million American phones,” Lutnick said Thursday on CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street.” If China doesn’t approve the deal, “then TikTok is going to go dark.” Related Stories 'Wednesday' Season 2 Trailer Shows Jenna Ortega Fighting to Save Enid After a Psychic Vision of Her Death 'Wednesday' Renewed for Season 3 at Netflix “Basically, Americans will have control” of TikTok in the U.S., Lutnick said. “Americans will own the technology. Americans will control the algorithm. That’s something Donald Trump is willing to do.” Popular on Variety Under a U.S. law that went into effect Jan. 19, 2025, it is illegal for American companies to host or distribute TikTok in the country as long as it remains controlled by Chinese parent company ByteDance. The legislation passed last year with overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress, on fears that the popular video entertainment app’s ties to China‘s communist regime make it a national security risk. It was signed into law by President Biden. Trump last month issued his third executive order delaying enforcement of the law until Sept. 17 while members of his administration attempt to hammer out a deal to restructure TikTok U.S.’s ownership in a way that complies with the law — while also being an arrangement the Chinese government will approve. In an interview with Fox News that aired June 29, Trump claimed his administration has identified a group of “very, very wealthy people” who will buy TikTok in the U.S. “I think I’ll need, probably, China’s approval, and I think President Xi [Jinping] will probably do it,” he said in the interview. However, Trump did not reveal who the purported buyers are. Trump told host Maria Bartiromo he would say “in about two weeks” who the buyers are, but to this point there have been such announcements. Trump, in the final months of his first administration, tried unsuccessfully to ban TikTok unless its ownership was transferred to U.S. companies. But after the 2024 election Trump said “I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok,” because “there are those who say” the app helped drive support for him among young voters. ByteDance has said 60% of its ownership is represented by global institutional investors including BlackRock, General Atlantic and Susquehanna, with 20% owned by its Chinese founders and 20% by employees including those in the United States. The U.S. divest-or-ban law prohibits distribution of any app in which companies or individuals located in a country that is a “foreign adversary” to the United States “directly or indirectly own” at least a 20% stake. At a congressional hearing in March 2023, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew said, “ByteDance is not owned or controlled by the Chinese government” and said there is an “inaccurate belief that TikTok’s corporate structure makes it beholden to the Chinese government or that it shares information about U.S. users with the Chinese government. This is emphatically untrue.” A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment

Title: Where to invest $10,000 right now, according to 6 Wall Street heavyweights

If you have $10,000 in cash waiting to be invested, you probably wish you had shoveled that money into the stock market in mid-April. But you're not the first, and won't be the last, investor who missed a good entry point into the market. Even with the market at all-time highs since hitting a bottom in April, that doesn't mean it's a bad time to jump in. Six Wall Street veterans told Business Insider that there are still plenty of pockets of opportunity. Some, for example, still like tech stocks as AI investment booms. Some of those same people also think it's smart to hedge and diversify right now amid the hype and lofty valuations. They recommend allocating some money to areas like value or international stocks. There's no one-size-fits-all approach to investing. Figuring out where to put your money depends on your individual circumstances, like your investment timeline and risk tolerance. For this hypothetical thought exercise, we asked our sources where they themselves would invest the money if they suddenly came into $10,000. Santos said that if she were gifted $10,000 right now, she would invest $7,000 in developed-market ex-US stocks and the remaining $3,000 in emerging-market stocks. "After 15 years of disappointment, it's really been all about international equities this year — huge outperformance, and something we see as just the beginning," Santos said. Santos is still bullish on US stocks, but said that international stocks are primed for relative outperformance given how high valuations are on US stocks. Historically, US stocks have traded at a 15% premium to international stocks, but now trade at a 35% premium. Plus, the value of the US dollar has fallen in recent months, and demand for ex-US assets has risen. "For someone, maybe like me, who's been too concentrated just on the US equity story, I think we've really seen a huge turning point to put some of that money to work overseas finally," she said. Two examples of exchange-traded funds that offer exposure to these areas include the Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF (VEA) and the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM). Year-to-date, the funds are up 19.7% and 18.6%, respectively. Bannister identified three baskets of opportunities: value stocks, small-caps, and international stocks. For value stocks, he said to go with a large-cap value fund like the Vanguard Value ETF (VTV). For small-caps, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) works well for its broad-based nature having exposure to the growth and value factors, Bannister said. And for international stocks, Bannister like the iShares MSCI ACWI ex US ETF (ACWX). These trades provide diversification from a tech-concentrated market, Bannister said. "Right now the market's obsessively focused on tech. But it's hard to run an economy on seven stocks," Bannister said, referring to the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks. Bannister said he recently put long-term bets on these trades himself. "I actually put a third, a third, a third, into small-cap, international, and value on some money that came in in May that I got, and we'll see how it works out for 10 years," he said. Normally, Smith would simply recommend a broad market index so that your money is well diversified. There's only one problem with that: most main indexes aren't all that diversified at the moment, with the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks making up almost a third of the S&P 500. So Smith has an easy fix: Put 50-60% of the money into an equal-weight S&P 500 fund, like the Invesco S&P 500® Equal Weight ETF (RSP), rather than the more widely followed market cap-weighted index. The equal-weight product gives you the same exposure to all 500 companies in the index instead of adjusting for exposure by company size. The equal-weight index has generally underperformed over the last five years, but it would hypothetically suffer less downside in a tech sell-off. The remaining 40-50% of the money can go into a more concentrated cap-weighted index like the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100, Smith said. That way, you don't miss out too much if the tech rally keeps ripping. "Now you get all your top tech holdings that are driving this market," he said. Smith's suggestions assume at least a five-year timeline. Unlike Santos, Kantrowitz is still bullish on the American exceptionalism theme and would continue to bet on the US stock market for the next few years. Kantrowitz doesn't have a specific sector slant — he recommends investing in large-cap profitable leaders within their industries. "The earnings backdrop is going to be very bifurcated, and interest rates are going to remain elevated," Kantrowitz said of the next few years. With this backdrop, existing large-cap winners will continue to perform and have better earnings revisions than their peers. Kantrowitz would avoid passive sector indexes like a broad tech ETF, as those often don't accurately reflect the performance of the underlying basket of stocks due to weighting criteria. Instead, he recommends a more active stock-picking approach. The largest names that are screening well in Piper Sandler's models include Big Tech names — unsurprisingly, Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta make the list — and companies like Oracle, Costco, Johnson & Johnson, and Home Depot. DeSpirito, who manages several funds with a focus on combining value and quality, would split his investment between large-cap growth companies, dividend stocks, and value stocks. His guiding principle is building a well-diversified portfolio that can weather market volatility, given tariff headlines. The S&P 500 has undoubtedly become more expensive and growth-oriented thanks to the dominance of tech, but it's still a good idea to maintain exposure to Big Tech, according to DeSprito. "I'm not negative on the Mag Seven," DeSpirito said. "Many of them have really good growth and really good free cash flow. That's an incredibly powerful combination, and so they earn the multiples that they're trading at." For diversification, dividend stocks tend to be more resilient during downturns and provide a steady stream of income. DeSpirito is also on the hunt for unloved stocks that are trading cheaply. Healthcare companies are an especially compelling opportunity at the intersection of value and quality, according to DeSpirito. This area of the market has been largely ignored by investors, with the S&P 500 healthcare sector down 2% year-to-date. DeSpirito likes medical device companies, as these trade at mid-teens earnings ratios with good growth prospects. However, some large-cap pharmaceutical companies could be value traps, as their earnings are heavily dependent on patents, DeSpirito warned. For investors with a longer timeline and a higher risk tolerance, Castleton suggested a three-pronged approach in equities. First, plug around 60% of your funds into large-cap stocks with a bias toward tech. Despite its comeback rally after a sharp dip earlier this year, tech is "still one of the areas and sectors that's going to dominate the markets for the next 10 years" given the innovation coming out of the sector, Castleton said. There are multiple ways to get exposure to the tech theme, but some general example funds might include the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) and the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ). Second, put about 20% of the fund into ex-US stocks. International stocks have gotten a big boost this year amid Trump's trade war and initial pullback from US support in Ukraine, and Castleton thinks the rally can continue. "You have to have some of that diversification because I truly believe going forward that you'll continue to see value coming out of Europe, some of these ex-US players that are now all of a sudden shifting their mentality to spending more on defense, to deregulating their companies," she said. Third, Castleton said to put the remaining 20% into mid-cap stocks, or companies with a market cap between $2 and 10 billion. This can provide further portfolio diversification, Castleton said, but the stocks should also benefit from reshoring as the deglobalization trend continues. "They're more domestically-oriented companies, and they also have a lot more room to grow than the large caps that have already kind of established their business models," she said. Jump to

Title: Ethereum Is Becoming Crypto’s Reserve Asset: New Research
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-crypto-reserve-asset-research/
Time Published: 2025-07-24T13:00:37Z
Full Content:
A new research from analytics firm Artemis argues that Ether is undergoing the same reputational pivot Bitcoin experienced in the mid-2010s, but on fundamentally different terms. “Evaluating ETH purely through the lens of cash flows or protocol fees is a category error,” writes lead author Kevin Li. “It is better understood as a scarce yet productive, programmable reserve asset whose value accrues through its role in securing, settling and powering an increasingly institutionalized on-chain economy.” Li begins by tackling the long-running critique that Ethereum’s flexible monetary policy disqualifies it as a store of value. He models a worst-case scenario in which every ETH in existence is staked and issuance hits its theoretical ceiling. Even then, annual inflation tops out at roughly 1.52 percent in 2025 and decays to 0.89 percent by 2125—well below the US dollar’s 6.36 percent average M2 expansion since 1998 and even beneath gold’s long-run annual supply growth. The paper argues that the combination of sublinear issuance and the EIP-1559 burn has already pushed net inflation near—or periodically below—zero, giving ETH a supply profile that “rivals gold while retaining the programmability of software.” Macro conditions provide the backdrop for the thesis. Artemis notes that decades of monetary expansion have eroded trust in fiat and driven investors toward alternative stores of value. The US consumer-price index has averaged 2.53 percent a year since 1998, but the money supply has grown more than twice as fast, a gap the report claims “may account for a significant share of nominal equity-market gains.” Ethereum’s adaptive monetary policy, Li contends, offers a disciplined alternative without sacrificing the network’s ability to pay validators. Institutional adoption is the second pillar of the argument. Over the past 12 months JPMorgan, BlackRock and Robinhood have each chosen Ethereum rails—either the base layer or an affiliated roll-up—for tokenized deposits, money-market funds and equity trading prototypes. The report cites BlackRock’s BUIDL fund and JPMorgan’s forthcoming JPMD deposit token as proof that blue-chip institutions are no longer experimenting on testnets but building products that will settle value at scale. “As traditional finance migrates on-chain, the need to hold and stake ETH becomes structural rather than discretionary,” Li writes. That dynamic is visible in on-chain data. Artemis calculates that the supply of stablecoins and tokenized real-world assets on Ethereum reached a record $123 billion in June, while the amount of ETH locked in validators climbed to 35.5 million. The year-on-year correlation between the value of on-chain assets and staked ETH exceeds 88 percent across every major category the firm tracks, reinforcing the idea that demand for security and settlement drives demand for the native token. Regulation, long the wild card for any staking-based value proposition, has started to tilt in Ethereum’s favor. On May 29 the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s Division of Corporation Finance issued guidance stating that protocol-level staking, delegated staking and certain custodial staking arrangements do not in themselves constitute securities offerings. While the ruling left room for fact-specific enforcement, it cleared the way for spot-ETH ETF filers to include staking provisions in their S-1 amendments. Several prospective issuers have since done exactly that, promising investors both passive exposure to ETH and a share of consensus rewards. The Artemis report also highlights an emerging “treasury-asset wave” reminiscent of MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy in 2020. Sharplink Gaming disclosed in late May that it would begin allocating corporate cash to Ether, a move followed by a cluster of smaller US and Asian public companies. Together they now hold more than 730,000 ETH, or roughly $2.6 billion at current prices. The accumulation has coincided with a period of ETH outperformance versus BTC—an unusual trend in the current cycle, which has otherwise been dominated by Bitcoin narratives such as halving supply shocks and prospective US reserve holdings. Critics who argue that Layer 2 networks cannibalize Ethereum’s fee base “miss the point,” Li says. By off-loading execution while anchoring settlement and data availability to the base layer, roll-ups expand Ethereum’s total addressable market without eroding its security budget. Li compares the arrangement to the Federal Reserve System: “Regional banks handle day-to-day traffic, but ultimate settlement rests with the central bank.” In that analogy ETH is the reserve asset that guarantees finality. The paper concedes that other high-throughput Layer 1s, particularly Solana, have siphoned off “meme-coin velocity” and micro-transaction volume. Solana processed more transactions than Ethereum in five of the past six quarters. Yet Li argues that the market for assets requiring maximal security is “orders of magnitude” larger than the market for speculative trading throughput, especially as traditional finance tokenizes bonds, deposits and money-market funds. Perhaps the most pointed section of the report re-examines Bitcoin’s own “digital gold” narrative. Just as early critiques once dismissed BTC as volatile, illiquid and pointless, ETH today faces doubts about its identity. “Bitcoin users once had to justify why a purely digital bearer asset could compete with gold,” Li writes. “Ethereum users now have to justify why a programmable, yield-bearing, burn-limited asset can compete with bitcoin. The burden of proof is reversing.” After Ethereum’s long-awaited transition to proof-of-stake and barely two months after the SEC’s staking guidance, the conversation around ETH has shifted from “utility token” to something far closer to “reserve asset.” If Li’s thesis holds, future debates may revolve less around whether Ethereum can catch Bitcoin’s market cap and more around what happens when institutions treat Ether not as gasoline for smart contracts but as the base money of the emerging on-chain economy. At press time, ETH traded at $3,585. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email. Jake Simmons has been a Bitcoin enthusiast since 2016.

Title: The investment chief at $10 trillion giant Vanguard says it’s time to pivot away from U.S. stocks

Shawn Tully is a senior editor-at-large at Fortune, covering the biggest trends in business, aviation, politics, and leadership. Greg Davis visited Fortune this month dressed like a Wall Street titan—and bearing a very un-Wall-Street message about a tepid future for U.S. stocks.On July 11, Davis––the president and chief investment officer of Vanguard Group––came to our offices in Manhattan’s Financial District for a chat with this reporter. Though Davis works from Vanguard’s mother ship (its buildings are all named for British vessels from the Napoleonic wars) in the tiny hamlet of Malvern, Pa., west of Philadelphia, he arrived attired in a tailored gray suit and purple silk tie combo that would have fit right in with the most formal of the investment banking cadre and portfolio managers headquartered nearby.Yet Davis’s message couldn’t have been more contrary to the fashionable view among the neighborhood’s rosy prognosticators. The 25-year Vanguard veteran’s outlook contradicts the prevailing position advanced by the big banks, research firms, and TV pundits that despite serial years of big gains, U.S. stocks remain a great buy. That bull case rests mainly on optimism that the Big Beautiful Bill’s deregulatory agenda and tax cuts will spur the economy, and that the AI revolution promises a new world of efficiencies that will shift earnings to super-fast track going forward. The powerful momentum that has driven the Nasdaq and S&P 500 to all time highs this week bolster their argument for more to come. Davis follows the Vanguard mindset that, arguably more than any other, revolutionized the investing world over the past half-century. The company’s founder, John Bogle, created the first index funds for ordinary investors in 1975, following the conviction that funds choosing individual stocks regularly fail to beat their benchmarks after fees, and that a pallet of diversified index funds, and later ETFs, that hold expenses to an absolute minimum, provide the best platform for achieving superior gains over the long-term. The top testament to the enduring validity of the Vanguard model: Over 80% of its ETFs and indexed mutual fund beat their peer-group averages over the past 10 years, measured by LSEG Lipper, largely courtesy of those super-tight expense ratios. The Vanguard model’s won such overwhelming favor that it now manages 28% of the combined U.S. mutual fund and ETF universe, and it’s gained 7 points in market share in the past decade. At $10 trillion in AUM, it ranks second only to BlackRock among all U.S. asset managers. Besides offering over 400 super-low-cost funds worldwide, Vanguard also provides investment advice as a firm, and through its army of financial advisers. A big part of the Vanguard formula: Periodically rebalancing from securities that get extremely pricey by historical standards into areas that are undervalued versus their norms. In our discussion, Davis provided a master class on how the dollars in profits you’re getting for each $100 you’re paying for a stock influences future returns, and why now is such a crucial time to shift from what’s highly, even dangerously expensive into safe areas that look like screaming buys. Put simply, Davis argues that U.S. equities are a victim of their own success. For Davis, the fabulous ride in recent years virtually guarantees that future returns will prove extremely disappointing versus outsized, double-digit gains investors have gotten used to, and that the investment pros predict will persist. The reason is simple: U.S. stocks have simply gotten so costly that their forward progress is destined to radically slow. “Our investment strategy group’s projection is that U.S. equity market returns are going to be much more muted in the future,” Davis warns. “Over the past ten years, the S&P returned an average of 12.4% annually. We’re predicting the figure to drop to between 3.8% and 5.8% (midpoint of 4.8%) over the next decade.” The basic market math, he contends, points to that outcome. Davis notes that the official price-to-earnings multiple on the S&P now stands at an extremely lofty 29.3. And when Vanguard uses a preferred gauge based on Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert Shiller’s Cyclically Adjusted Price-to-Earnings multiple, or CAPE––a measure that adjusts the PE by normalizing for spikes and valleys in earnings––it concludes that US stocks hover 49% over the top end of the group’s fair value range. Davis also points out that corporate profits are now extremely high by historical levels, and hence won’t grow nearly as fast from here as their jackrabbit pace of recent years. In other words, don’t count on an EPS explosion to solve the valuation problem. In fact, this reporter notes that contrary to what we’re constantly hearing about forthcoming double-digit increases in profits, the sprint has already slowed to a stroll. From Q4 of 2021 to Q1 of this year, S&P 500 EPS grew from $198 to $217, or 9.6% in over three years, a puny pace that doesn’t even match inflation. Davis explained how the longstanding bull market has wildly distorted the standard “60-40” portfolio. That classic construction of 60% stocks and 40% bonds has worked well in many periods, he notes. But today, folks who started at 60-40 a decade ago, and didn’t rebalance into bonds as equity prices swelled year after year, are now banking far too heavily on those richly-valued U.S. equities. “In the past 10 years, interest rates have mainly been very low, so bonds returned only around 2% a year, or 10% less than stocks,” declares Davis. “So the stock portion kept compounding at a high rate and getting bigger, and the bond portion kept shrinking as a share of the total. As a result, what started as a 60-40 mix is now 80-20 in favor of stocks.” To make matters worse, says Davis, “U.S. stocks outperformed international equities by 6 percentage points a year in the past decade. So 10 years ago, if you started with the standard split 70% U.S. and 30% foreign, you’d now be at 80% U.S. and 20% foreign.” Hence, sans rebalancing, an investor’s overall share of U.S. stocks would have gone from 42% to around two-thirds, a gigantic leap. Those weightings, he says, are lopsided in the wrong direction, in two ways—by holding far too big a percentage of stocks and not enough bonds, and within the equity portion, not owning enough foreign shares. “If you look at the bond market today and the way yields have risen, we’re projecting that you’re going to pick up very similar returns in a mix of U.S. and foreign bonds as you’ll get in U.S. equities, or also 4% to 5%. So the expectations are comparable, but you’ll have much less volatility on the bond side,” avows Davis, adding, “What’s the big advantage to betting on risky stocks when you can get 4.3% on three-month Treasuries?” Hence, Davis makes a daring recommendation: Investors should reverse the classic blend and go with 60% bonds and 40% stocks. For the fixed income portion, he notes, Vanguard’s Total World Bond ETF (BNDW) offers a blend of domestic and international fixed income, encompassing government bonds, corporates, agencies, mortgages, and asset backed securities. In addition, Vanguard projects that foreign shares over the next ten years will generate average returns of 7%, waxing the 5% or so for U.S. equities. Hence, Davis recommends that in the 40% dedicated to stocks, investors lean heavily to the international side by splitting the allocation evenly, or 20% and 20%, between stateside and international stocks. The Vanguard FTSE All World ex US ETF (VEU) would fit the slot reserved for the international allotment. In summary, Davis is advising a radical rebalancing for folks who let their U.S. stocks swallow a bigger and bigger part of their portfolios as bonds and international shares underperformed year after year. So here’s are allocations he’d recommend for the decade ahead: 60% fixed income, 20% international equities, and—gulp—just 20% in U.S. stocks. Once again, that number compares to the around two-thirds you’d hold in U.S. equities if you’d started at 60-40 ten years ago and just let your gains on U.S. stocks rip without any rebalancing. I ran some numbers on the returns you’d garner in the two scenarios: First, if you don’t rejigger and keep holding two-thirds of your portfolio in U.S. stocks, and second, if you do what Davis advocates and put 60% in bonds, and park more of the equity share abroad. In both cases, the projected future return is just over 5% yearly. No big difference in returns over the next decade. So why choose the Davis formula? The edge in making the big shift: The path will be much smoother, predictable, and less nerve-rattling that sticking with a huge over-weighting in U.S. stocks. Of course, Davis recommends rebalancing gradually, and funding as much of it as possible with fresh savings and reinvestment of dividends and high interest payments from fixed income assets. Davis isn’t recommending crypto investing as a means of boosting your returns at a time when U.S. stocks won’t come close to matching their past performance. “I got into this business around the time of the dot.com era,” he told me. “Anything with a dot.com behind it went to the moon. Some were actually really good businesses, however the majority were not. Good things can come out of crypto like blockchain, and that technology can reduce costs in the financial sector and improve speed, so we think there are some good fundamental components to it. But to us investing in Bitcoin is speculation.” For Davis, Bitcoin offers none of the advantages of traditional investments that generate interest payments, or earnings that feed capital gains and dividends. “It’s not investing in a cash flow generating business, it’s not investing in bonds where you have a commitment to getting a coupon payment every six months, then principal at maturity,” he explains. “It’s basically looking to sell to someone willing to pay more than you did. And the whole idea that a limited supply of Bitcoin will drive up its value is questionable when you consider that there’s an unlimited supply of new types of crypto that could be created. So I personally don’t get it. Vanguard won’t launch a Bitcoin fund. We just don’t see it as a core part of an investment portfolio.” Davis grew up on an Army base near Nuremberg, Germany, the child of a father in an Airborne division and a German mother. As a kid, he mainly spoke German, including with his grandmother, and didn’t live in the U.S. until age 7. “When I go to Germany and speak the language, people can tell I’ve kept the Bavarian dialect,” he declares. He started at Penn State pursuing aeronautical engineering, but lack of skill in mechanical drawing forced him to switch—to a major in insurance. “Penn State was one of the few schools that offered that unusual major,” he says. Davis went on to get an MBA at Wharton, and after a brief stint in a Merrill Lynch training program, got an offer from Vanguard that would require a move from Wall Street to the sleepy suburbs of Philly. Davis took the job in part because Vanguard was then a fast-growing shop, where he figured his chances of advancement would be better than at a huge bank or brokerage. He was especially attracted to Vanguard’s highly unusual “cooperative” model, where the funds––meaning the investors––are the shareholders. “So because we have economies of scale where over time our revenues grow faster than expenses, we can rebate that money back to investors by lowering fees,” he says. Davis proudly notes that Vanguard has made 2,000 such reductions in its history, and especially that in February it announced the biggest decrease ever—a cut of $350 million across 68 mutual funds and ETFs in equities and fixed income. Vanguard’s whole approach where the objective is to constantly lower fees is highly un-Wall Street. So is Davis’s contrarian counsel to follow what the valuations and history tells us, to shift from stocks that are extremely expensive and whose prices can’t grow to the sky, despite what the bulls are saying. It’s a sobering, cautionary tale. But it’s one that makes eminent sense. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

EDIMBURGO – Cuando en 2021 se celebró la Conferencia de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Cambio Climático en Glasgow (COP26), Mark Carney era una figura imponente en el mundo financiero. En aquel momento, quien hoy es primer ministro de Canadá (hecho atribuible en gran medida al llamado del presidente de los Estados Unidos Donald Trump a que Canadá se convierta en el 51.º estado) era enviado especial de las Naciones Unidas para la acción climática y las finanzas. En la COP26, Carney anunció la creación de la Alianza Financiera de Glasgow para las Cero Emisiones Netas (GFANZ por la sigla en inglés), que sería madre de tres hijas precoces: la Alianza Bancaria para las Cero Emisiones Netas (NZBA), la Alianza de Aseguradoras para las Cero Emisiones Netas (NZIA) y la iniciativa de Gestoras de Activos para las Cero Emisiones Netas (NZAM). En opinión de algunos escépticos, todo eso no era más que un montón de ceros; pero Carney aseguró a un mundo expectante que «no es bla bla bla», y que el concepto de cero emisiones netas sería la «infraestructura crítica del nuevo sistema financiero». ¿Qué ha sido pues de la iniciativa de Glasgow con los años? ¿En qué extremo del continuo de «infraestructura crítica bla bla bla» estamos? Hay que decir que el paso del tiempo no ha sido benévolo con la sopa de letras de Carney. A principios de este año, los mayores bancos estadounidenses (JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs y el resto) se retiraron de la NZBA, evidentemente temerosos de presiones políticas del nuevo gobierno de Trump. A los grandes bancos estadounidenses se sumaron los canadienses, mostrando escasa lealtad a la creación de quien más tarde sería su primer ministro. Y en abril, los miembros restantes diluyeron los compromisos iniciales: fijaron como nuevo criterio un máximo de 2 °C de aumento de temperaturas (en vez de los ya hace mucho irrelevantes 1,5 °C) y abandonaron el objetivo de llegar a cero emisiones netas en 2050. Pero la hemorragia no terminó allí. Este mes, HSBC anunció su deserción, y parece muy probable que habrá otros. Hoy los miembros representan un poco más de la mitad del patrimonio de los fundadores; pero todavía quedan algunos bancos comprometidos y la NZBA sigue viva. Our Summer Sale has begun.

Subscribe Now No puede decirse lo mismo de su hermana menor, la NZIA. Incluso antes de la elección de Trump, algunos procuradores de estados bajo control republicano, cuestionando la formulación conjunta de objetivos climáticos, acusaron de cartelización a los principales miembros de la entidad. Puede que sus motivos hayan sido más bien distintos, pero tenían un argumento válido desde el punto de vista legal: los fundadores no habían analizado lo suficiente lo que esa formulación conjunta de compromisos implicaba. Tras una serie de retiradas, en abril de 2024 la NZIA colapsó. Ha aparecido una especie de sustituto, el Foro para la Transición de las Aseguradoras a las Cero Emisiones Netas, cuyos miembros están sujetos a obligaciones más laxas y sin formulación de metas ni publicación de información obligatoria. El foro también asegura que tiene abogados internos encargados de vigilar cualquier posible infracción futura de la legislación antimonopolio. Para completar la familia, la tercera hija (NZAM) también experimentó en enero una andanada de retiradas, encabezada por BlackRock, que provocó la suspensión de sus actividades y la cancelación de la lista pública de firmantes. No está claro cuándo terminará la suspensión (si termina). Ya hemos hablado de las hijas; ¿qué ha sido de la madre? Técnicamente, la GFANZ todavía existe, pero tras una remodelación sustancial. Ahora se describe como un «grupo de directores» independiente sin precalificaciones para el ingreso; y ya no apunta a ser guardián del objetivo de cero emisiones netas sino un facilitador de financiación para la transición energética, tarea loable, pero lejos de la imaginada en un principio. Es difícil ver en todos estos hechos tomados en conjunto otra cosa que no sea un debilitamiento significativo del compromiso del sector financiero con el apoyo a la transición verde. Pero ¿dónde están las autoridades regulatorias, que los presionaban para que se pusieran a la altura del desafío y fueran parte de la solución al cambio climático, en vez de convertirse en futuras víctimas? En 2017, ocho bancos centrales formaron la Red para la Ecologización del Sistema Financiero (NGFS), una «coalición de voluntarios» con inclusión del Reino Unido, Francia y China, pero no de Estados Unidos. La Reserva Federal (siempre tan orgullosa de su independencia política) decidió sumarse tras la victoria electoral de Joe Biden en 2020, para retirarse a principios de este año. Pero en este caso, otros bancos centrales siguen comprometidos. Algunos (por ejemplo el Banco de Inglaterra) le restaron importancia a las pruebas de estrés climático, pero los miembros de la NGFS (que ahora son unos 140) no han dejado de creer que el aumento de las temperaturas medias implica riesgo de disrupción económica y que la transición energética creará ganadores y perdedores. Un análisis reciente de la NGFS sugiere que los riesgos económicos son mayores de lo que se pensaba. Si los bancos y las aseguradoras no comprenden lo que está en juego, pueden sufrir efectos negativos, que a las otras amenazas que enfrentamos, les sumarán la inestabilidad financiera. Pero que nadie crea que el resto del mundo puede seguir como hasta ahora. Hay señales inequívocas de que Estados Unidos está presionando a los organismos de regulación internacionales para que le resten importancia a su trabajo en materia climática. El último comunicado del Consejo de Estabilidad Financiera (FSB) señala que «aunque muchos miembros consideran que hay necesidad de hacer más, algunos creen que la labor completada hasta ahora es suficiente», y parece que los «algunos» se han impuesto a los «muchos». También el Comité de Basilea degradó su trabajo en lo referido a la publicación de información relacionada con el clima y eliminó cualquier obligación de cumplimiento. Aunque hay que decir que el Comité de Basilea rechazó un pedido de Estados Unidos de disolver su grupo de trabajo sobre el clima, parece que los representantes estadounidenses ya no asisten a las reuniones, lo que evidentemente disminuye su eficacia. ¿Hacia dónde vamos pues? La evidencia científica indica a las claras que el impacto del calentamiento global en el sector financiero crece día a día, pero la resistencia estadounidense a cualquier acción resultante por parte de las empresas o de las autoridades regulatorias es cada vez más firme. Y como es bien sabido, cuando una fuerza irresistible se encuentra con un objeto inamovible, es muy difícil predecir el resultado. En este caso, mi apuesta es por la fuerza irresistible. Habrá un incidente (tal vez el primero sea en el mundo de los seguros) que nos enseñará la importancia de apuntalar las defensas. Pero aun así, las autoridades regulatorias fuera de Estados Unidos tienen que mantener la presión.

Title: Has Trump Killed Green Finance?
URL: https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-trying-to-end-green-finance-by-howard-davies-2025-07
Time Published: 2025-07-24T11:30:09Z

Just four years ago, the world's banks, insurers, and asset managers were pledging to align their operations with the goal of achieving net-zero emissions, in order to mitigate the risks to financial stability posed by climate change. Now, however, those pledges have been sharply curtailed, owing to US pressure since January. EDINBURGH – At the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow (COP26), back in 2021, Mark Carney bestrode the financial world like a colossus. Now Canada’s prime minister, thanks in large part to US President Donald Trump’s call to make the country America’s 51st state, in 2021 he was the UN Special Envoy for Climate Action and Finance. At COP26, Carney announced the creation of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), the parent of three precocious children, the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA), the Net-Zero Insurance Alliance (NZIA), and the Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) initiative. All that amounted to a whole lot of zeros, in the view of some sceptics, but Carney assured an expectant world that “It’s not blah blah blah,” and that net zero would form the “critical infrastructure of the new financial system.” So, how well has the Glasgow initiative aged? At which end of the critical infrastructure-blah blah blah spectrum do we find ourselves? The intervening years have not been kind to the alphabet soup Carney cooked up. At the beginning of this year, the biggest US banks – JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, and the rest – pulled out of the NZBA, clearly fearing political pressure from Trump’s new administration. The big US banks were soon followed by the Canadian banks, showing little loyalty to their future prime minister’s creation. In April, the remaining members watered down the initial commitments, focusing on alignment with a maximum 2º Celsius temperature rise, rather than the long mooted 1.5ºC, and abandoning the target of full net-zero compliance by 2050. But that did not stem the flow of departures. Earlier this month, HSBC announced its defection, and it seems highly likely that others will do likewise. Today the members represent only a little over half the assets of the founders, but there are still some committed banks, and the NZBA remains alive. Our Summer Sale has begun.

Subscribe Now That is more than can be said for its little sister, the NZIA. Even before Trump’s election, some attorneys general from Republican-controlled states, raising concerns about collaborative climate pledges, had targeted the major members on antitrust grounds. Their motives might have been rather different, but legally they had a point. The founders had not properly thought through the implications of the pledges they were making. After a spate of withdrawals, in April 2024 the NZIA collapsed. There has been a replacement of sorts, in the form of the Forum for Insurance Transition to Net Zero. The forum’s membership obligations are more flexible, and there are no targets or reporting obligations. It also claims to have armed itself with in-house lawyers to guard against any potential future contraventions of antitrust law. To complete the set, the third child, the NZAM, also experienced a spate of withdrawals in January, led by BlackRock. That led to a suspension of its activities, and the removal of its published list of signatories. It is not clear when, if ever, the suspension will be lifted. We have accounted for the children, but what about the parent? GFANZ still technically exists, but has been substantially remodeled. It now describes itself as an independent “Principals Group” with no pre-entry qualifications, and has shifted its focus from being a net-zero gatekeeper to becoming a facilitator of finance to fund the energy transition – a worthy task, but far from what was initially envisaged. It is hard to see these developments, taken together, as anything other than a significant watering down of the financial sector’s commitment to supporting the green transition. But where are the regulators, who were exerting pressure on their charges to step up and ensure that they were part of the climate-change solution, rather than being casualties of the problem? The Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) was created by a coalition of eight willing central banks in 2017. The coalition included the United Kingdom, France, and China, but not the United States. After Joe Biden’s election in 2020, the Federal Reserve, which prides itself on its political independence, decided to join, only to withdraw earlier this year. But in this case, other central banks remain committed. Some, like the Bank of England, have de-emphasized their climate stress-tests, but NGFS members, now numbering some 140, still believe that rising average temperatures threaten economic disruption, and that the energy transition will create winners and losers. Recent analysis by the NGFS suggests that the economic risks are greater than previously thought. If banks and insurers do not understand the implications, they may be adversely affected, adding financial instability to the other threats we face. It would be idle to imagine, though, that the rest of the world can continue as before. There are unmistakable signs that the US is putting pressure on international regulatory bodies to downgrade their climate-related work. The last communiqué from the Financial Stability Board noted that “while many members feel there is a need for more work, some feel that the work completed to date is sufficient,” and it seems that the “some” have dominated the “many.” Similarly, the Basel Committee has downgraded its work on climate-related disclosures and removed any requirement to comply. The Basel Committee did refuse a US request to disband its climate task force, but the US representatives reportedly simply do not turn up, which clearly impacts its effectiveness. So, where do we go from here? All the scientific evidence suggests that the impact of global warming on the financial sector is growing relentlessly, but US resistance to any resulting action by firms or their regulators is becoming firmer. The outcome of a clash between an irresistible force and an immovable object is notoriously hard to predict. In this case, my bet is on the irresistible force. A bad outcome, perhaps first in the insurance world, will illustrate the importance of shoring up our defenses. But even then, non-US regulators need to keep up the pressure.

Title: Crypto Prices Dump as FTX Plans September Payout: $SNORT Is a Smart Buy Now

The entire crypto market is on a down-drift after what seems to be a prolonged market correction, forcing Bitcoin down to $118,148 after a 0.40% slip over the past 24 hours. While there are multiple proposed reasons for the current market shift, one of them seems to connect to FTX’s payment plan set to come into effect in September. The now-defunct exchange will release another court-approved payment round of at least $1.9B through the same third-party entities: Kraken, Payoneer, and BitGo. This marks the third big payout in 2025 as part of FTX’s efforts to repay their creditors and redistribute $14.5B in damages. FTX’s upcoming payment could explain, at least in part, the current market shift by digging up the doubt and fear linked to the disgraced exchange, following Sam Bankman-Fried’s scam. An even bigger factor for the current market sentiment seems to be Bitcoin’s $86M in outflows, with BlackRock ($IBIT) and Fidelity ($FBTC) bearing most of the burden, with $142.48M and $227.24M respectively. Trader T is the bearer of bad news, keeping track of Bitcoin’s performance and highlighting the three consecutive days of consistent outflows. The outflows aren’t bad on their own, but their impact on the market is. Entities like Fidelity, for instance, may be forced to liquidate their Bitcoin holdings to cover the withdrawals, which could increase the sell pressure, amplify price volatility, and push market sentiment even lower. But what are the triggers behind this sudden market shift, given that FTX’s payment plan couldn’t account for it on its own? Several factors may contribute to the current market shift: However, while the market is on the back foot, it’s unlikely to backpedal for too long. The Fear and Greed Index is already telling half the story, with the community sentiment still borderline extremely greedy. Trader Tardigrade seems to nourish similar sentiments, stating that, based on the market’s performance, crypto is set to become the largest asset in the world. Another crypto analyst, Titan of Crypto, hints at a second Breakout coming, which would be the final hurdle before Altcoin Season 3.0. With the market winding for a coming rally, some assets may experience higher gains than others, especially those with blockchain utility and massive long-term potential. Snorter Token is one of them, introducing the Snorter Bot, the trading companion which snipes hot tokens milliseconds after liquidity appears. Snorter Token’s ($SNORT) Snorter Bot promises to become the most proficient coin hunter, thanks to its ease of use, integrated scam alerts, protecting against suspicious projects, and its appetite for hot and booming tokens. The Aardvark sniper is the perfect solution to manual coin hunting, which demands high technical knowledge and subjects you to potential scams like honeypots and rug pulls. The Bot operates in its Telegram chat-only, centralizing its activity in one place and rendering the need for multiple wallets, plug-ins, and browser extensions obsolete. You only need to instruct the Bot accordingly and watch it claim its victims milliseconds after liquidity becomes available. This reaction time puts UIs like Raydium, Pump Fun, and Jupiter to shame. Based on these facts, Snorter Token is set to become one of the best meme coins on the market, following successful implementation and witnessing widespread adoption. The project is currently in presale, having accumulated over $2.3M with a token price of $0.0991. Given Snorter Bot’s roadmap and efficiency, we expect the project to witness growing success post launch. In that context, $SNORT could easily push to $0.94 shortly after its public listing. If you want to support the project and buy yourself some $SNORT, go to the presale page and place your order today. Despite the heavy Bitcoin outflows and the perceived market uncertainty, the bullish market sentiment seems to suggest that what we’re seeing is not recession, but rather market correction, following the recent generalized rally. We expect Bitcoin to push again soon, once it clears the psychological threshold of $120K, at which point projects like Snorter Token ($SNORT) will also steam up.

Title: Inside Private Equity’s $29 Trillion Retirement Savings Grab
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/hanktucker/2025/07/24/private-equitys-29-trillion-retirement-savings-opportunity-under-trump/

ByHank Tucker andSergei Klebnikov ByHank Tucker, Forbes Staff andSergei Klebnikov, Forbes Staff. Jack Bogle became a legend by popularizing low-cost passive index funds at the Vanguard Group, which he founded in 1975 after spending the first 23 years of his career at Wellington Management. “Don’t look for the needle in the haystack. Just buy the haystack,” he famously mused. That philosophy—be the market, don’t try to beat it—spawned generations of index fund-loving, buy-and-hold “Bogleheads” who have made Vanguard into what it is today: a $10 trillion-in-assets mutual fund colossus serving more than 50 million individual customers. Over the same half-century, private equity was also growing into a more than $10 trillion-in-assets industry—in a very different way. This one was built on the promise of market-beating returns produced by managers demanding high fees: usually a percent of assets (typically 2% a year) and a hefty cut of profits (typically 20%). Plus they insisted on a long-term commitment of assets by their institutional investors, inclu­ding pension funds, college endowments and foundations. Vanguard, which Bogle set up to be owned by its investors, has produced a lot of prosperous retirees but zero money-manager billionaires. Private equity, with its profit share (known as carried interest), has minted dozens of them. Stephen Schwarzman, chairman, CEO and cofounder of Blackstone, the world’s largest private equity manager with more than $1 trillion in assets under management, is worth an estimated $50 billion. So it was a bit jarring, culturally and historically speaking, when Vanguard and Wellington announced in April that they had formed a “strategic alliance” with Blackstone to offer products for individual investors blending private and public market assets. Jarring but maybe not so surprising given that the heavyweights of private equity and retail distribution are now pairing off with an urgency that suggests they’re desperate to avoid missing out on the next big moneymaking opportunity: getting into Americans’ 401(k)s and IRAs, which hold $29 trillion in assets. And the Trump administration aims to help them. In February, Boston’s State Street Investment Management, which created the exchange-traded-fund business back in 1993, kicked off the action by offering the first ETF with a mix of public and private debt, with the latter sourced from private equity giant Apollo Global ($785 billion under management). Then, a couple months later, State Street announced the launch of an “Index Plus” retirement target date fund series—90% index funds with a 10% kicker of Apollo private market assets. In May, Empower, a top player in the market for small-company 401(k)s, said it’s working with Apollo, Franklin Templeton, Goldman Sachs and others to offer retirement savers collective investment trusts containing a mix of private equity, private credit and real estate. And in July, Voya Financial, another big 401(k) player, announced it was teaming up with private credit’s Blue Owl Capital on a new series of blended products. There’s no mystery why private asset mana­gers are keen to play. After years of beating public stock markets, private equity’s average annual return has lagged stocks by more than three points over the last three years (see “Turn of Fortunes”). A slowdown of exit deals has led to a glut of aging assets in private equity funds. New funds raised by the industry have plunged 39% since 2021 as clients have fewer payouts to reinvest and some college endowments and pension funds are free­zing or even reducing their private asset allocations (see “A Slowing Spigot”). Private asset managers have been gathering money from high-net-worth individuals for more than a decade. Until now, though, they haven’t cracked regular investors’ $29 trillion retirement nest egg—$12 trillion in defined contribution workplace plans like 401(k)s and $17 trillion sitting in individual retirement accounts. That’s now changing. Crucially, President Joe Biden’s Department of Labor threw cold water on private assets in 401(k)s, but President Donald Trump is reportedly close to signing an executive order specifically encouraging alternative assets in the accounts. The mutual fund and retail distribution companies see a win here too. Their margins have shrunk as competition and the share of money in low-cost index funds have grown. A private-assets kicker is a new way to differentiate their offerings and charge higher fees. Ordinary investors? They may or may not be winners. More options are almost always a good thing, but they need to be careful of higher fees and less liquidity. Plus, assessing the performance of these new hybrid private products will be difficult. In an interview with Forbes in June 2017, a year and a half before his death at 89, Bogle wasn’t giving any ground. “The idea of making money for the funds’ shareholders is counter-opposed to the idea of making money for fund managers,” he declared. Wellington Management CEO Jean Hynes, ensconced in an office on the top floor of a 31-story tower overlooking Boston Harbor, likes the long view: The 56-year-old has spent her entire career at the firm. She was raised in the Boston suburb of Milton as one of six children born to Irish immigrants—her father was a bricklayer—who believed, she says, in investing through their children; they spent their money sending them to Catholic school and college. Hynes wound up at Wellesley College, where she majored in economics and interned for a local stockbroker. After graduating in 1991, she was hired by Wellington as an administrative assistant. Her detailed notes at morning investing meetings impressed the late Ed Owens, who managed the Vanguard Health Care Fund to a 16.4% average annual return over 28 years before retiring in 2012. Hynes became his research assistant, protégé and, eventually, a fund manager herself. “It was a match made in heaven from day one,” she says. “He’s probably one of the top 25 investors of all time, and that’s who I learned from and worked with for 20 years.” After winning the CEO job in 2021, Hynes got some advice from health care chiefs she knew. Merck’s Ken Frazier (now retired) told her that of all the decisions he made daily as CEO, only four really mattered. The lesson: Get the big swings right. Hynes sees the alliance with Blackstone as one of those big decisions. She ticks off the trends she has seen—actively managed equity, an explosion of fixed income, the dominance of index funds and, now, alternative investments. And she makes a credible case for why Main Street investors might want to get into private assets. “If you look holistically at the economy, 20 years ago the average person who invested and bought mutual funds could invest in the whole economy. And that’s not true today,” she says. “You have a whole part of the economy that is only for the institutional investor, and that’s all the private companies.... It’s fair that more individuals have access to that.” While Wellington has always been an active manager, it is deeply intertwined with Vanguard’s low-cost passive investing DNA. The relationship dates to Bogle’s firing as Wellington’s CEO in 1974 during a brutal bear market. A boardroom fight and peace treaty eventually left him in charge of a new company (Vanguard) that would administer funds, while Wellington controlled investment management and distribution. Bogle told Forbes in 2017 that he launched low-cost index funds and direct-to-consumer sales in part because it allowed him to do an end run around Wellington by claiming there was no money management or distribution involved. A half-century later, Wellington is still the largest external advisor for Vanguard’s actively managed funds. The Vanguard Wellington Fund, the nation’s oldest balanced mutual fund (two-thirds stocks, one-third bonds) has returned an average of 8.3% annually since inception in 1929. It charges a modest 0.25% of assets and has $115 billion in assets. While Wellington has dabbled in private markets for a decade, they still amount to only $9 billion of the $1.2 trillion in assets it manages, less than 0.8%. So last year, when Hynes was ready for her big swing, Wellington approached Blackstone about teaming up. “We’ve never thought that we would be good at buyouts, taking a company private and managing a company and fixing it. That’s not our skill set,” says Wellington managing partner Terry Burgess, who supervises the team tasked with steering the alliance’s funds. Its first product, the WVB All Markets Fund, is a closed-end “interval fund”—meaning it will offer quarterly redemptions to investors for liquidity and could be the centerpiece of a diversified portfolio. Public stocks (from Vanguard funds and direct Wellington investments) will be 40% to 60% of assets; bonds (through actively managed Vanguard funds) will be 15% to 30%; and private Blackstone funds will make up 25% to 40%. Wellington will determine exactly how assets are allocated. The preliminary prospectus leaves the door open for exposure to private equity, credit, real estate and privately owned infrastructure. It doesn’t specify what the management fee will be, but it will be on top of the fees in the underlying funds. If the overall fund is down in value due to a decline in the public markets, Wellington will reimburse it for Blackstone’s performance fees—that way, retail investors sitting on losses from WVB wouldn’t get whacked with a stiff performance fee regardless. The WVB Fund will be marketed first to wealthy clients through financial advisors and family offices. But all eyes are on the 401(k) prize. “Do I think over time, privates will start to serve more of a role when it comes to target date funds? I do,” says Vanguard president and chief investment officer Greg Davis, noting that the timing will depend on how comfortable plan sponsors (meaning employers) are with adding higher-cost products to their offerings. It’s notable that across the industry, the new private asset–tinged investments are being sold first to accounts managed by financial advisors and to target date funds, which are managed by investment pros, with allocations based on a saver’s expected (i.e., target) retirement date. “It’s a simple equation,” Vanguard founder Jack Bogle told Forbes in 2017. “Gross return minus costs equals net return, which is a universal principle in investing that I put to work after a long struggle.” Target dates are an obvious entry point for two reasons. First, they’re growing like crazy. Thanks to Congress and regulators, millions of workers are being automatically enrolled in 401(k)s, with their contributions (and employer matches) funneled into target dates by default. According to Morningstar, over the last 15 years, assets in these funds have grown at an astounding 30% annual compound rate and now amount to $4 trillion. Vanguard controls 37% of the target date market, more than double the share of its nearest competitor, Fidelity Investments. The second reason is that professional management of target dates blunts the criticism that average investors won’t be able to judge the performance of hard-to-value private assets. “I think over time, just like there are Morningstar ratings of all sorts of public mutual funds, when you look out five, ten years from now, all these funds are going to be ranked based on performance,” says Jonathan Gray, Blackstone’s president and chief operating officer. “That is critically important.” Private equity pioneer KKR launched in 1976 with cash from an insurance company and wealthy backers. But by 1978, it had money from Oregon’s public pension plans, and others soon followed. Today, public pensions allocate an average 23% of assets to alternative investments, the National Association of State Retirement Administrators reports. College endowments began piling aboard after David Swensen took over Yale’s endowment in 1985 and bolstered returns by diversifying into private assets. Today, endowments allocate an average 26% of assets to private markets, accor­ding to Cambridge Associates. Harvard has 39% in private equity; Princeton has 41%. Now some of these traditional sources are pulling back. As America’s richest colleges face deep federal funding cuts and a federal tax as high as 8% (up from 1.4%) on endowment income, Yale, Harvard and others are said to be selling private equity investments on the secondary market. The University of California system is cutting back on its target allocation for private investments in its endowments and pension funds, even as it is working with State Street to make private assets available in employees’ retirement savings plans. Traditional pension plans, particularly private ones, are diminishing in relative importance as employers shift the retirement burden to workers. Back in 2000, traditional pensions—public and private combined—held roughly the same $5 trillion as 401(k)s and IRAs. Now it’s $12 trillion and $29 trillion, respectively, according to the Investment Company Institute. Private asset managers have been wooing financial advisors and their wealthy clients with perpetual capital funds, which often allow up to 5% of investors to cash out each quarter. An early example was the Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust, launched in 2017. It now has $53 billion in net assets. Blackstone Private Credit Fund, launched in 2021, has $72 billion. All told, Blackstone manages $270 billion from individuals, and this market is growing with a boost from cloud-based platforms for investment advisors. Example: BlackRock, which manages $12.5 trillion in assets, recently teamed up with fintechs GeoWealth and iCapital to create model portfolios holding both private and public assets. Joan Solotar, Blackstone’s head of global private wealth, says most individual investors in private markets have $5 million or more in investable assets, but those with at least $1 million are now being actively targeted. “It’s still quite early for investors below a million dollars,” she adds. Except when it comes to 401(k)s and target date funds. This does not come without risk. In a recent report, Moody’s laid out a series of worries about the push to put private assets into ordinary Americans’ portfolios. A big one is that Main Street investors, used to quick access to their cash, will create liquidity risks. “These fund structures haven’t really been tested extensively at periods of market stress,” says Alexandra Aspioti, a Moody’s senior private credit analyst. “Retail investors tend to be more sensitive to market volatility and increase redemption requests during periods of stress—this in turn can lead to further volatility.” Another worry Moody’s describes: All those extra dollars sloshing around will encourage private asset managers to make dumber deals, particularly in credit. The credit risk is real and growing. Private lenders face fewer regulatory requirements than traditional banks, which is largely why they financed 77% of private equity buyouts last year, according to Preqin. Private loans don’t trade and are valued only quarterly, with estimates that are often well off the mark. The International Monetary Fund warned last year that private lenders’ connections to private equity-backed companies could allow systemic problems to go undetected for too long. As for retail investors and liquidity risk, there have already been scares. Blackstone had to limit redemption requests in its real estate income trust in late 2022 and most of 2023 when individuals spooked by rising interest rates raced for the exits. The market rebounded, and Blackstone is back to honoring 100% of repurchase requests, but there’s little assurance that a similar situation won’t result in a future crash. Another concern: As exit deals from private equity funds have slowed, a fast-growing secondary market, including so-called continuation funds, has emerged, with a record $160 billion in transaction volume in 2024. With continuation funds, asset managers in essence are using new investors’ money to pay off old ones. Orlando Bravo, cofounder and managing partner of $184 billion (assets) Thoma Bravo, has cautioned that in this financial game of musical chairs, retail investors who are late to the party might get saddled with continuation funds with underperforming, hard-to-sell assets. Wellington’s Burgess promises that individual investors in the Wellington-Vanguard-Blackstone product will have access to the same private funds as Blackstone’s institutional clients—not the rejects. And he insists that the proposed fund will be able to withstand waves of withdrawal requests. “There’s 70% of it that’s public, and that’s a really big buffer to make sure you can maintain your liquidity profile,” he says. “We’ve tested it in [severe] down markets, and it’s gone to a level that’s still below what we would consider to be a pain point.” Then there are the objections raised by the Biden administration: that private assets might be too expensive and complex for 401(k)s. “These products are harder to understand and harder to value—it’s very different from looking at individual stocks traded on the public market or mutual funds,” says Lisa Gomez, who served under Biden as the Department of Labor’s assistant secretary for employee benefits security. But private asset managers are betting that the Trump administration will dismiss such worries and are hoping it—and the Republican Congress—will provide some protection from worker lawsuits for employers who offer the new products in their 401(k)s. That could further line the pockets of the wealthiest people in finance. It also could be great for individual investors, who will no longer be locked out of the type of lucrative private investments that have made the nation’s colleges and pension plans so rich for so long. With so much information soon to be available at their fingertips, retail investors might prove to be smarter than Wall Street thinks. They need to keep an eye on fees, and there is risk, for sure. But blue-chip financials like Blackstone, Vanguard and Wellington are going to be extra-careful not to saddle retirement savers with lousy private investments, thereby damaging their brands. Other outfits might be less cautious—caveat emptor—but democratizing investing is well worth the attendant dangers.

Title: Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton Is Outsourcing More of His Office’s Work to Costly Private Lawyers

Despite having an office with hundreds of attorneys, Ken Paxton frequently opts to hire private lawyers. One cost taxpayers more than $24,000 in one day. This article is co-published with ProPublica, a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up for ProPublica’s Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox as soon as they are published. Also, sign up for The Brief, our daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news. One day in late May 2024, lawyer Zina Bash spent 6 1/2 hours working on a case against Facebook parent company Meta on behalf of the state of Texas. She reviewed draft legal filings. She participated in a court-ordered mediation session and then discussed the outcome with state Attorney General Ken Paxton. In her previous job as senior counsel on Paxton’s leadership team, that labor would have cost Texas taxpayers $641. But Bash had moved to private practice. Paxton hired her firm to work on the Meta case, allowing her to bill $3,780 an hour, so that day of work will cost taxpayers $24,570. In the past five years, Paxton has grown increasingly reliant on pricey private lawyers to argue cases on behalf of the state, rather than the hundreds of attorneys who work within his office, an investigation by The Texas Tribune and ProPublica found. These are often attorneys, like Bash, with whom Paxton has personal or political ties. In addition to Bash, one such contract went to Tony Buzbee, the trial lawyer who successfully defended Paxton during his 2023 impeachment trial on corruption charges. Three other contracts went to firms whose senior attorneys have donated to Paxton’s political campaigns. Despite these connections and what experts say are potential conflicts of interest, Paxton does not appear to have recused himself from the selection process. Although he is not required to by law, this raises a concern about appearing improper, experts who study attorneys general said. Paxton appears to have also outsourced cases more frequently than his predecessors, available records show. And he’s inked the kind of contingent-fee contracts, in which firms receive a share of a settlement if they win, far more often than the attorneys general in other large states, including California, New York and Pennsylvania. Since 2015, the New York and California attorneys general have awarded zero contingent-fee contracts; Pennsylvania’s has signed one. During that period, Paxton’s office approved 13. One of those was with Bash’s firm, Chicago-based Keller Postman, at the time known as Keller Lenkner, which she joined as partner in February 2021 after resigning from her job at the attorney general’s office. Paxton had signed a contract with the company two months earlier to investigate Google for deceptive business practices and violations of antitrust law. A little more than a year later, Bash’s firm won a state contract to work on the Meta litigation, alleging its facial recognition software violated Texans’ privacy. This time, Bash was the co-lead counsel. Meta, which called the lawsuit meritless, settled the case for $1.4 billion in the summer of 2024. It was a windfall for Keller Postman. The firm billed $97 million, the largest fee charged by outside counsel under Paxton’s tenure. Bash’s work alone accounted for $3.6 million of that total. This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply. Bash, a former U.S. Supreme Court clerk, said in a statement she is honored the attorney general’s office partnered with Keller Postman based on the firm’s “first-rate attorneys and extensive experience.” “We have a record of taking on the most significant litigation in the country against the most powerful defendants in the world,” Bash said. Keller Postman did not respond to a request for comment. There is little to stop Paxton, or any other occupant of his office, from handing these contracts out. The attorney general can award them without seeking bids from other law firms or asking anyone’s permission. Asked to provide competitive-bid documents for the contingent-fee contracts it has awarded, the attorney general’s office said it had none because state law “exempts the OAG from having to do all of the solicitation steps when hiring outside counsel.” Given the high-profile nature of representing an attorney general and the potential for a big payday, many qualified firms would be eager to compete for this work, said Paul Nolette, a professor of political science at Marquette University who studies attorneys general. “I’d be curious to know what the justification is for this not going on the open market,” Nolette said. Paxton declined interview requests for this story. He has publicly defended the practice of hiring outside law firms, arguing that his office lacks the resources in-house to take on massive corporations like tech companies and pharmaceutical manufacturers. “These parties have practically unlimited resources that would swamp most legal teams and delay effective enforcement,” Paxton told the Senate finance committee during a budget hearing in January. A spokesperson for Paxton said in a statement that the outside lawyers hired by the office are some of the best in the nation. With the contingent-fee settlements to date, more than $2 billion, the state “could not have gotten a better return on its investment,” the statement said. Chris Toth, former executive director of the National Association of Attorneys General, questioned why so much extra help is needed. Outside counsel is appropriate for small states, he said, that “only have so many lawyers with so many levels of expertise.” The Texas attorney general’s office, one of the largest in the country, has more than 700 attorneys. “Large states typically don’t hire outside counsel,” Toth said. “They should have the people in-house that should be able to go toe-to-toe with the best attorneys that are out there.” When a Texas attorney general previously made a practice of giving lucrative contracts to private counsel, it didn’t end well. Dan Morales was the last Democrat to hold the office. He became embroiled in scandal after he used outside firms to help secure a $17 billion settlement in Big Tobacco litigation in 1998. Republicans, including then-Gov. George W. Bush, blasted the $3.2 billion payout to the outside lawyers as exorbitant. Their attacks grew more intense when Morales sought to steer $500 million of that sum to a lawyer, a personal friend, who did very little work on the case. Morales pleaded guilty in 2003 to related federal corruption charges. He served 3 1/2 years behind bars. John Cornyn, the Republican who succeeded Morales in 1999, criticized his predecessor’s handling of the tobacco case during his campaign for the office. In an interview for this story, Cornyn said he never hired outside counsel as attorney general because he focused on recruiting talented in-house lawyers that he felt could handle all the office’s cases. Paxton is challenging Cornyn, now a four-term U.S. senator, in next year’s Republican primary. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, the Republican who led the office after Cornyn, appears to have rarely used private lawyers. The attorney general’s office was able to produce records for only part of Abbott’s 12-year term because state law allows the files to be deleted after so many years. The office signed nine outside counsel contracts between 2010 and 2014, all pro bono or for hourly rates rather than contingency. Abbott did not respond to an interview request. Paxton also seldom outsourced cases during his first five years in office. Through 2019, he awarded only nine outside counsel contracts, all pro bono or hourly rate. The most expensive contract capped fees at $500,000 — far less than $143 million the state paid to the two firms, including Bash’s, that handled the Meta case. He changed course in 2020. That summer, the attorney general’s office was gearing up to file its first case against Google. It related to allegations that the company monopolized the online advertising market, raising costs for advertisers, who increased the price of their products for average consumers as a result. Paxton initially had no plans to hire outside counsel for the litigation, three former deputy attorneys general told the Tribune and ProPublica. But before the case was filed, the attorney general’s office was thrown into upheaval. At the end of September, seven of Paxton’s senior advisers reported him to the FBI, concerned his relationship with an Austin real estate investor had crossed the line into bribery and corruption. State House members would later impeach Paxton on counts related to the accusations; state senators eventually acquitted him. The federal criminal investigation into Paxton did not result in any criminal charges. Over fall 2020, each of the lawyers in his office who had accused Paxton of wrongdoing quit or was fired. That included Darren McCarty, the head of civil litigation who was supposed to lead the Google litigation before he reported his boss to the FBI. He resigned on Oct. 26. Less than two months later, on Dec. 16, Paxton signed contracts with The Lanier Law Firm and Keller Postman to investigate Google. They filed the lawsuit against the tech giant in federal court the same day. Paxton replaced the lawyers who complained to the authorities. The staffing of the antitrust and consumer protection divisions, which would have handled these cases, remained constant at more than 80 employees in the following years. Yet Paxton continued to outsource lawsuits against large corporations to private lawyers. Under Keller Postman’s contract, the firm would be paid only if it secured a settlement or won at trial. These contingent-fee cases have the potential to be far more profitable for the outside firms than those in which they bill at a regular hourly rate. In a successful case, the contracts say that firms are paid either a percentage of a settlement or the sum of hours billed by the firm times four, whichever is less. In the Meta case, Keller Postman was entitled to 11% of the state’s settlement, a share that totaled $154 million. But because the firm’s fees and expenses totaled $97 million, it billed that sum. In multiple legislative sessions, Paxton has testified that outsourcing was the only way his office could stand toe-to-toe with corporate titans. If Paxton has a shortage of qualified in-house attorneys, Cornyn told the newsrooms, that’s because of the damage the whistleblower scandal did to the reputation of the attorney general’s office as a home for ambitious young lawyers. “He’s a victim of his own malfeasance and mismanagement because people did not want to work for him anymore,” Cornyn said. “And if you run off your best lawyers because you engage in questionable ethical conduct, then you’re left with very few options. But this shouldn’t be a way to reward bad behavior.” Former Arizona Attorney General Terry Goddard said he was surprised Paxton began hiring contingent-fee outside lawyers only after the scandal, since those contracts, with their potential for high profits, are tougher to ethically defend. “I would have thought it would have been the other way around — that he got more careful after he got the whistle blown on him,” said Goddard, a Democrat. “But it looked like he got more reckless.” Paxton’s style of procurement also benefited Buzbee, the man who successfully defended him during his impeachment trial, which stemmed from allegations the whistleblowers raised. The attorney general chose to skip most of the proceedings, so for the 10 days of trial in the Texas Senate, his most vociferous advocate was the loquacious Buzbee. The pair sat side by side when the attorney general did attend. A little more than a year later, Paxton hired The Buzbee Law Firm to pursue an antitrust suit against the investment firms BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard that accuses the companies of manipulating the coal market in a way that allegedly increased electricity prices for Texans. The firms deny wrongdoing. Buzbee is a successful litigator and one of Houston’s most famous plaintiffs’ attorneys. Among other victories, he won settlements for victims of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and $73 million for Gulf of Mexico oil drillers in a 2001 antitrust case. But he’s known primarily for personal injury work, not antitrust litigation. His firm, one of two hired for this latest attorney general’s office contingent-fee case, could collect 10% of any judgment or settlement. The case is in its early stages, though the Trump administration in May filed a brief in the case in support of Texas. Buzbee downplayed the potential for a big payday in an email to the newsrooms and argued there is no buddy system at play, noting he believed other law firms also interviewed with Paxton’s office for the job. (The attorney general’s office did not confirm this.) He said his firm has to pay for significant expenses up front, without any guarantee of payment. “The current arrangement may be a good deal for other lawyers, but in all candor, it’s not for me,” Buzbee said, adding that his normal hourly rate is $2,250. “Frankly, the only reason I’m even doing it is that I am proud to represent the state in such a landmark case.” The connections between Paxton and the lawyers he has hired also extend to other firms. The attorney general’s office hired the firm Norton Rose Fulbright, one of the largest in the country with more than 3,000 lawyers on staff, to work on separate Google cases for the state, focusing on consumer protection allegations. The attorney general’s office has awarded three contracts to the firm since 2022 for cases against the tech giant. Three times during that period, Joseph Graham, the firm’s lead counsel on the Google litigation, contributed $5,000 to Paxton’s campaign for attorney general. Twice, the donations came within 16 days of Graham signing one of the firm’s contracts with the attorney general. The firm and its attorneys have contributed $39,500 to Paxton’s campaign since he took office. Neither Graham nor Norton Rose Fulbright responded to requests for comment. Mark Lanier, founder of The Lanier Law Firm, which the state hired to work on a separate Google case, is a large donor to Texas elected officials. He has contributed $31,000 to Paxton’s campaigns since 2015. The largest contribution, for $25,000, came six months after Lanier signed his firm’s Google contract. The Lanier contract is slightly different from the others the attorney general’s office awarded, in that the firm’s payment is partially based on a basic hourly rate but it could also be paid more if it wins the case, as in the contingent-fee model. Lanier noted in an emailed statement to the newsrooms that he took a reduced fee on this case and maintained that the attorney general’s office needed the kind of firepower his team can bring against an opponent like Google. “The Texas AG office and its lawyers are good, but specialists are needed in a war like this. And it is a war,” Lanier wrote. “It would be irresponsible to pursue Google on behalf of Texans without bring[ing] the fullest resources you can.” A competitive, open process for awarding contracts can be a strong defense against accusations of favoritism, Goddard said. Unlike some other states, Texas does not require these contracts be put out to competitive bid. Florida, for example, has one of the most robust laws in the country for procuring outside counsel, requiring the attorney general to explain in writing why a contingent-fee contract is necessary. It also mandates most contracts be put out to competitive bid and caps contingent-fee payouts at $50 million. Texas has no such cap. It also has virtually no method for state lawmakers to truly supervise this kind of practice. State law mandates only that the attorney general notify the Legislature when his office awards a contingent-fee contract, and certify that no in-house lawyers or private attorneys at an hourly rate can handle the task. Paxton has done so in boilerplate two-page letters that all say outside attorneys are needed because of the “scope and enormity” of the cases. If lawmakers are concerned about these contracts, there is no mechanism for them to challenge Paxton’s determination that private counsel is needed. Having lawyers bid for work would eliminate the appearance of impropriety that hangs over Paxton’s hires, Goddard said. “A couple look like paybacks, which is extraordinarily improper, in other words to award a contract to someone who’s a major contributor or has recently left your office,” he said. “All of those would not be allowed in our state.” Officials in other states have said they can still secure big wins for their constituents without relying on private firms. California, for example, reached a $93 million settlement with Google in 2023 over claims that the company was clandestinely tracking users’ locations. A year earlier, in a case with similar allegations, Oregon and Nebraska led a 40-state coalition that won a $392 million settlement against the company. Texas was not part of this suit. The latter agreement required Google to make new privacy disclosures to consumers, restricted its ability to share users’ location information with advertisers and required the company to prepare an annual report detailing how it was complying with the settlement terms. Doug Peterson, the Republican attorney general of Nebraska at the time, said negotiating the financial penalty — Nebraska’s share was $11.9 million — was a secondary goal of the settlement. “The most important thing we’re trying to do is to stop the bad behavior,” Peterson said. McCarty, one of the attorney general employees who blew the whistle on Paxton, said private lawyers can be talented, but they have an incentive to fixate on the financial portion of settlements — which is tied to their compensation — rather than enforcement provisions that may best protect a state’s residents. “Government enforcers, especially in the antitrust context, can focus on more effective solutions,” McCarty said. Norton Rose Fulbright has yet to send its final billing records to the attorney general’s office but is likely to be rewarded handsomely. The firm helped the state secure a $1.38 billion settlement with Google in May. Google spokesperson José Castañeda said the Texas settlement, which has not been finalized, will contain no new restrictions on the company’s practices. Under the terms of its contracts, the firm’s fees could exceed $350 million.

Title: Trump and the energy industry are eager to power AI with fossil fuels

Time Published: 2025-07-24T09:09:04Z

President Donald Trump participates in the Inaugural Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit at Cohon University Center at Carnegie Mellon University on July 15, in Pittsburgh, Penn. Photo by The White House/Wikimedia Commons (Public domain) This story was originally published by Wired and appears here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration AI IS “NOT my thing,” President Donald Trump admitted during a speech in Pittsburgh on Tuesday. However, the president said during his remarks at the Energy and Innovation Summit, his advisers had told him just how important energy was to the future of AI. “You need double the electric of what we have right now, and maybe even more than that,” Trump said, recalling a conversation with “David”—most likely White House AI czar David Sacks, a panelist at the summit. “I said, what, are you kidding? That's double the electric that we have. Take everything we have and double it.” At the high-profile summit on Tuesday — where, in addition to Sacks, panelists and attendees included Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, Google president and chief investment officer Ruth Porat and ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods — companies announced $92 billion in investments across various energy and AI-related ventures. These are just the latest in recent breakneck rollouts in investment around AI and energy infrastructure. A day before the Pittsburgh meeting, Mark Zuckerberg shared on Threads that Meta would be building “titan clusters” of data centers to supercharge its AI efforts. The one closest to coming online, dubbed Prometheus, is located in Ohio and will be powered by onsite gas generation, SemiAnalysis reported last week. For an administration committed to advancing the future of fossil fuels, the location of the event was significant. Pennsylvania sits on the Marcellus and Utica shale formations, which supercharged Pennsylvania’s fracking boom in the late 2000s and early 2010s. The state is still the country’s second-most prolific natural gas producer. Pennsylvania-based natural gas had a big role at the summit: The CEO of Pittsburgh-based natural gas company EQT, Toby Rice — who dubs himself the “people’s champion of natural gas” — moderated one of the panels and sat onstage with the president during his speech. All this new demand from AI is welcome news for the natural gas industry in the US, the world’s top producer and exporter of liquefied natural gas. Global gas markets have been facing a mounting supply glut for years. Following a warm winter last year, Morgan Stanley predicted gas supply could reach “multi-decade highs” over the next few years. A jolt of new demand — like the demand represented by massive data centers — could revitalize the industry and help drive prices back up. Natural gas from Pennsylvania and the Appalachian region, in particular, has faced market challenges both from ultra-cheap natural gas from the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico as well as a lack of infrastructure to carry supply out of the region. These economic headwinds are “why the industry is doing their best to sort of create this drumbeat or this narrative around the need for AI data centers,” says Clark Williams-Derry, an energy finance analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. It appears to be working. Pipeline companies are already pitching new projects to truck gas from the northeast — responding, they say, to data center demand. The industry is finding a willing partner in the Trump administration. Since taking office, Trump has used AI as a lever to open up opportunities for fossil fuels, including a well-publicized effort to resuscitate coal in the name of more computing power. The summit, which was organized by Republican senator (and former hedge fund CEO) Dave McCormick, clearly reflected the administration’s priorities in this regard: No representatives from any wind or solar companies were present on any of the public panels. Tech companies, which have expressed an interest in using any and all cheap power available for AI and have quietly pushed back against some of the administration’s anti-renewables positions, aren’t necessarily on the same page as the Trump administration. Among the announcements made at the summit was a $3 billion investment in hydropower from Google. This demand isn’t necessarily driven by a big concern for the climate — many tech giants have walked back their climate commitments in recent years as their focus on AI has sharpened — but rather pure economics. Financial analyst Lazard said last month that installing utility-scale solar panels and batteries is still cheaper than building out natural gas plants, even without tax incentives. Gas infrastructure is also facing a global shortage that makes the timescales for setting up power generation vastly different. “The waiting list for a new turbine is five years,” Williams-Derry says. “If you want a new solar plant, you call China, you say, ‘I want more solar.’” Given the ideological split at the summit, things occasionally got a little awkward. On one panel, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, who headed up a fracking company before coming to the federal government, talked at length about how the Obama and Biden administrations were on an “energy crazy train,” scoffing at those administrations’ support for wind and solar. Speaking directly after Wright, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink admitted that solar would likely support dispatchable gas in powering AI. Incredibly, fellow panel member Woods, the ExxonMobil CEO, later paid some of the only lip service to the idea of drawing down emissions heard during the entire event. (Woods was touting the oil giant’s carbon capture and storage business.) Still, the hype train, for the most part, moved smoothly, with everyone agreeing on one thing: We’re going to need a lot of power, and soon. Blackstone CEO Jonathan Gray said that AI could help drive “40 or 50 percent more power usage over the next decade,” while Porat, of Google, mentioned some economists’ projections that AI could add $4 trillion to the US economy by 2030. It’s easy to find any variety of headlines or reports—often based on projections produced by private companies—projecting massive growth numbers for AI. “I view all of these projections with great skepticism,” says Jonathan Koomey, a computing researcher and consultant who has contributed to research around AI and power. “I don't think anyone has any idea, even a few years hence, how much electricity data centers are gonna use.” In February, Koomey coauthored a report for the Bipartisan Policy Center cautioning that improvements in AI efficiency and other developments in the technology make data center power load hard to predict. But there’s “a bunch of self-interested actors,” Koomey says, involved in the hype cycle around AI and power, including energy executives, utilities, consultants and AI companies. Koomey remembers the last time there was a hype bubble around electricity, fossil fuels and technology. In the late 1990s, a variety of sources, including investment banks, trade publications and experts testifying in front of Congress, began to spread hype around the growth of the internet, claiming that the internet could soon consume as much as half of US electricity. More coal-fired power, many of these sources argued, would be needed to support this massive expansion. (“Dig More Coal—The PCs Are Coming” was the headline of a 1999 Forbes article that Koomey cites as being particularly influential to shaping the hype.) The prediction never came to pass, as efficiency gains in tech helped drive down the internet’s energy needs; the initial projections were also based, Koomey says, on a variety of faulty calculations. Koomey says that he sees parallels between the late 1990s and the current craze around AI and energy. “People just need to understand the history and not fall for these self-interested narratives,” he says. There’s some signs that the AI-energy bubble may not be inflating as much as Big Tech thinks: in March, Microsoft quietly backed out of 2GW of data center leases, citing a decision to not support some training workloads from OpenAI. “It can both be true that there's growth in electricity use and there's a whole bunch of people hyping it way beyond what is likely to happen,” Koomey says. Geoffrey Pounder | July 24th 2025, 06:19 am Headline: "Trump and the energy industry are eager to power AI with fossil fuels" Make that: "Trump and the fossil-fuel industry are eager to power AI with fossil fuels" It's wrong, misleading, and unhelpful to conflate the energy industry with fossil fuels. As if they are one and the same. The energy industry increasingly includes renewables like solar and wind. Other energy sources include hydro, nuclear, biofuels, etc. The fossil-fuel industry routinely conflates the two. They are not synonymous. Let's help ourselves, not the fossil-fuel industry.

Title: The Rise of Tokenisation: Stablecoins, big banks & the road ahead

Tokenisation has been a buzzword among crypto enthusiasts for years, promising to transform financial markets by moving assets like stocks, bonds, and real estate onto the blockchain. While regulatory support is growing, progress has been slower than expected. (Source: Reuters) Under President Trump’s administration, new laws have relaxed regulations around crypto. This has opened doors for faster development of tokenised financial assets and increased investor interest in the sector. Tokenisation involves converting traditional financial assets into blockchain-based tokens. These tokens represent the original asset and can be stored in crypto wallets or traded on blockchain platforms, just like cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins are tokenised versions of fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar. They’re pegged 1:1 with real assets and allow cross-border transfers outside traditional banking. While they face criticism for enabling illicit finance, they also serve populations with weak financial infrastructure. Stablecoins are booming, with the market worth around $256 billion and projected to reach $2 trillion by 2028. However, tokenised stocks, bonds, and other assets still lack scale and secondary market liquidity. Despite years of hype, tokenised assets face hurdles. Many banks are developing private blockchains that aren’t interoperable, limiting trading. Without public secondary markets, these tokens remain stuck in early-stage trials. Proponents say tokenisation improves liquidity for hard-to-trade assets like real estate and lowers entry barriers for retail investors. It could create fractional ownership opportunities and democratize access to complex asset classes. Major institutions like Bank of America, Citi, and BlackRock are exploring tokenisation. Coinbase is seeking approval to offer tokenised equities, signalling growing institutional confidence in this space. New U.S. laws such as the Clarity Act aim to provide a defined legal framework for stablecoins and other tokens. These rules are expected to boost adoption and reduce legal uncertainty around tokenised assets. Despite optimism, risks remain. Critics warn of potential systemic vulnerabilities, especially without audits and strong oversight. The ECB has flagged stablecoins as threats to financial stability, and regulators insist that tokenised securities must still comply with existing laws.

Title: Retail Investors Want In—Just As Private Equity Industry Resets
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/carriemccabe/2025/07/24/retail-investors-want-in-just-as-private-equity-industry-resets/

ByCarrie McCabe ByCarrie McCabe, Contributor. Private Equity Retail investors are increasingly eager to access private equity (“PE”), drawn by the promise of higher returns and diversification. With public markets dominated by a narrow set of tech-driven mega-cap stocks, the appeal of uncorrelated, long-term private market exposure is growing. According to the American Investment Council’s 2025 public pension study, private equity delivered a median annualized return of 13.5% over the 10-year period ending in 2024. It was also the best-performing asset class in public pension portfolios—outpacing public equity, real estate, and fixed income. To date, retail investors have had limited access to burgeoning private assets, an immense marketplace. Private assets, including PE, have tripled in size since 2013 and are projected to reach $65 trillion globally by 2034, according to Bain. And more than 1,500 global startups now carry unicorn valuations, as companies stay private longer. Retail interest is being reinforced by a shift in policy. Congress is weighing legislation to allow defined contribution retirement plans—including 401(k)s—to access private equity. A new executive order is expected to clarify fiduciary protections for plan sponsors, particularly around fees and valuation concerns. However, retail’s arrival comes just as the private equity model is undergoing a profound transition. For much of the past decade, PE thrived on cheap debt, rising valuations, and global dealmaking. That model is under pressure. “Performance levers that were pulled to such great effect during the low-rate era—principally financial leverage and valuation expansion—will lose potency,” notes Future Standard in their recent private markets outlook. Rather today, with borrowing costs higher and valuations compressed, managers must create value through margin expansion, pricing power, and operational efficiency. Meanwhile, the macro backdrop isn’t helping. Current US policies have clouded the M&A environment, where valuation is often negatively correlated to volatility. And timely exits, which underpin PE’s return profile, are becoming harder to achieve. Distributions as a share of net asset value have fallen to just 11%—the lowest in over a decade. And PitchBook estimates there are over 12,000 U.S. PE-backed companies in inventory—enough to last seven or eight years at the current exit pace. Even elite investors are adjusting to this new PE environment. Yale University, long an advocate of PE, is reportedly seeking to sell up to $6 billion in private equity holdings to manage liquidity constraints. As institutional fundraising slows, Wall Street is turning to retail. BlackRock recently launched a target-date fund including private equity and credit, backed by $30 billion in acquisitions to expand its private markets platforms. Certainly, private equity remains a powerful investment engine, but it’s evolving. While institutional investors are equipped to navigate illiquidity, fees, and valuation opacity, the average retail investor may not be. Products reaching individual investors often lack the access or pricing advantages of large institutions. Layered fees—across platforms, managers, and structures—can severely dilute returns. In a lower-return environment, that friction matters more. Successful retail participation will depend on access via sophisticated fiduciary advisors—those bound to act in a client’s best interest and capable of navigating complexity. Policy may soon open the doors wider, but access is not the same as advantage. For retail investors, the PE opportunity is real—but so is the challenge to enter wisely.

Title: BlackRock To Buy 40% Stake In Aboitiz Equity’s Infrastructure Arm

ByIan Sayson ByIan Sayson, Forbes Staff. Aboitiz InfraCapital owns and operates the Mactan-Cebu International Airport. BlackRock will buy 40% of Aboitiz Equity Ventures’ privately held infrastructure unit, bolstering Aboitiz InfraCapital’s financial muscle as it steps up spending to modernize the country’s infrastructure. Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), BlackRock’s wholly owned unit, and Aboitiz Equity are in “the process of finalizing a strategic partnership,” the Philippine conglomerate said in a statement, without disclosing the amount of the potential sale. GIP, which was acquired by BlackRock in October, has over $183 billion in assets under management. It has interests in energy, transport, digital infrastructure, water utility and waste management sectors. “The Philippines has compelling growth prospects, which can be further enhanced by developing world-class infrastructure,” Bayo Ogunlesi, chairman and CEO of GIP, said. “We are pleased to have the opportunity to become a strategic partner of the Aboitiz Group.” The Philippine government aims to double infrastructure spending to at least 2 trillion pesos ($35 billion) by 2028 from 1 trillion this year as it accelerates projects such as the 33-kilometer Metro Manila subway that’s estimated to cost 489 billion pesos to build. Aboitiz Equity—the publicly traded holding company of tycoon Sabin Aboitiz and his family—has been scaling up its infrastructure investments in recent years. It has interests in airports, power plants, industrial estates, telecommunications towers and water utilities. Shares of Aboitiz Equity gained 2.3% in late afternoon trading in Manila. “We are honored to explore this opportunity with Global Infrastructure Partners,” Sabin Aboitiz, CEO and president of the conglomerate said. “Together, we aim to deliver projects that improve lives and empower communities.” Aboitiz InfraCapital swung to a 207 million loss in the first quarter even as sales jumped 53% to 2.4 billion pesos amid soaring finance charges on the company’s mounting debt levels. Its total borrowings almost tripled to 45.3 billion pesos as of end-2024 from a year ago. Aside from infrastructure, Aboitiz Equity has interests in banking, financial services, food manufacturing, and real estate. With an estimated net worth of $2.2 billion, the Aboitiz family is among the wealthiest in the Philippines.

Title: Goldman Sachs Partners With BNY Mellon To Bring $7 Trillion Money Market To Crypto

The growing intersection between traditional finance and digital asset infrastructure has taken another step forward, as Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon announced a joint initiative aimed at integrating blockchain technology into the money market fund (MMF) ecosystem. The collaboration will see BNY Mellon leverage Goldman Sachs’ GS DAP® (also known as its private blockchain) to maintain a mirrored tokenized record of customer ownership in select MMFs. This marks the first instance in the United States where mirrored tokenization will be used to reflect ownership in MMFs through a blockchain-based ledger. The rollout includes major asset managers such as BlackRock, BNY Mellon Investment Management’s Dreyfus, Federated Hermes, Fidelity Investments, and Goldman Sachs Asset Management. Investors will now be able to subscribe to and redeem MMF shares using BNY’s Liquidity management platform, which has been integrated with its digital assets platform to connect with the private blockchain. The mirror tokens created on the Goldman Sachs’ private blockchain platform do not replace official records but serve as a complementary layer that increases the accessibility and potential use cases of MMF shares in a digitized financial ecosystem. The mirrored tokenization of MMF shares using blockchain represents a new model for fund management infrastructure. Although the underlying assets remain managed through traditional custodial and compliance channels, the blockchain layer enhances interoperability and real-time transferability. Goldman Sachs’ GS DAP®, is built on smart contract technology from the startup Digital Asset and offers programmable finance functionality for institutions. BNY Mellon’s LiquidityDirectSM platform is also one of the leading portals for institutional cash investors, and the integration of the private blockchain opens the door to extending MMF shares into use cases like collateral optimization and intraday liquidity management. According to Laide Majiyagbe, BNY Mellon’s Global Head of Liquidity, Financing and Collateral, “Mirrored tokenization of MMF shares is a first step in this transition,” noting the company’s position as a link between established financial systems and new technology. GS DAP® was previously piloted for bond issuance on blockchain networks in Asia and Europe. Its adaptation for MMF share representation in the US signals a broader vision for tokenizing real-world assets beyond equities and debt, potentially reshaping capital markets infrastructure. This particular use case focuses on liquidity and settlement efficiency in short-term investment vehicles, valued at over $7 trillion globally, according to ICI data. Mathew McDermott, Global Head of Digital Assets at Goldman Sachs, emphasized the potential benefits of using tokenized MMF shares as collateral in various trading and settlement contexts. “Using tokens representing the value of shares of Money Market Funds on GS DAP® would enable us to unlock their utility as a form of collateral and open up more seamless transferability in the future,” he said in a statement. BNY Mellon will continue to serve as the official recordkeeper, maintaining existing regulatory compliance and settlement protocols. However, the addition of tokenized mirrors creates new flexibility for financial institutions seeking to modernize collateral management and liquidity strategies. While this initiative currently focuses on US MMFs, both institutions signaled interest in expanding the model globally, potentially applying similar technology to other fund structures and asset classes.

World Liberty Financial, a crypto venture linked to US President Donald Trump, has made another big move into Ethereum. The group converted $13 million worth of USDC into 3,473 ETH, adding to its already large stash of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. The move pushes the platform’s total Ethereum holdings to 73,616 ETH—worth about $275 million based on current prices. This latest transaction continues a buying trend that’s gained attention over the past few months. Data from Lookonchain shows that World Liberty Financial is sitting on an unrealized profit of more than $33 million. The project’s average entry price for Ethereum sits around $3,272. With ETH trading higher now, the bet appears to be paying off. Trump’s World Liberty(@worldlibertyfi) just spent 13M $USDC to buy 3,473 $ETH at $3,743 again! World Liberty has bought a total of 73,616 $ETH($275M) at an average price of $3,272, with an unrealized profit of $33M+.https://t.co/0qWkRUhTQb pic.twitter.com/WG1zpl3PJC — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 23, 2025 Last week, World Liberty also picked up over 3,000 ETH for $10 million. In May, they added another 1,580 ETH at a cost of $3.5 million. These steady acquisitions show a clear strategy: accumulate ETH and hold while prices climb. On the market side, Ethereum has responded with more green candles. The token rose 2% in the last 24 hours, hitting a daily high of $3,763. Over the past week, ETH is up 20%. Over the last month, it’s gained 65%. World Liberty Financial is not alone in taking a deep plunge into Ethereum. SharpLink and Bitmine have also boosted their ETH positions. And BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is said to be developing increasing interest in Ethereum, after establishing a strong presence in the Bitcoin arena. The momentum has also fueled the emergence of Ether Machine, a $1.6 billion Ethereum-specific effort. That effort is backed by the likes of Pantera Capital, Archetype, Kraken, Blockchain.com, and Electric Capital. All these moves set the scenario for Ethereum to be a leading option among the major players, not merely independent traders. The surging interest is driving ETH into the mainstream limelight. While new investors are buying in, older Ethereum holders are also stirring. Some dormant wallets recently moved vast amounts of the altcoin. This type of movement is bound to attract notice. It’s not the money—it’s when. And with so many of the major players stepping in, even long-quiet holders may find this the time to do something. Ethereum isn’t merely riding a wave of price activity. Institutions, funds, and political parties are stockpiling it, quietly transforming it into something bigger than another crypto token.

Amanda Gerut is the west coast editor at Fortune, overseeing publicly traded businesses, executive compensation, Securities and Exchange Commission regulations, and investigations. Tesla CEO Elon Musk just confessed that he thinks his 13% ownership stake in the electric vehicle manufacturer leaves him vulnerable to activist shareholders who could move to oust him from the $1 trillion company. Still, he admitted he shouldn’t have so much control over Tesla that the board can’t fire him if he goes “crazy,” he said during an earnings call on Wednesday. “It is a big deal—I don’t want to find I have so little control I can be easily ousted by activist shareholders,” Musk said. “That is a major concern to me as I’ve mentioned in the past and I hope that is addressed at the upcoming shareholders meeting.” I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having ~25% voting control. Enough to be influential, but not so much that I can’t be overturned.Unless that is the case, I would prefer to build products outside of Tesla. You don’t seem to understand…— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 15, 2024 Musk owns 13% of Tesla, a stake currently valued around $139 billion. He has previously stated he wants to own 25% of the electric vehicle manufacturer as it further expands into AI with unassisted Full Self Driving and robotics. Such a stake would be worth about $267.5 billion and would eclipse holdings by large institutional investors in Tesla such as Vanguard and Blackrock. Musk has worried in the past about the influence of activist investors or proxy advisory firms steering Tesla down the wrong long-term path at the expense of short-term pressures. However, Tesla currently maintains a defensive position against activists. Its bylaws call for what is termed a supermajority vote requirement, meaning shareholder votes must achieve support from two thirds of all outstanding shares (66.67%) rather than a simple 50% majority in order to pass. The board committed last year to Tesla shareholders that it would eliminate the supermajority vote requirement, but it hasn’t been able to muster enough investor participation. Tesla amended its bylaws in 2023 to provide shareholders with proxy access rights, meaning a shareholder or group of shareholders owning 3% or more of Tesla for at least three years can nominate directors to Tesla’s board. A stake that size would be valued at more than $20 billion. Securities and Exchange Commission rules require activist investors to disclose their stakes in company stock once they reach 5%, which is also the point where an activist can typically gain credibility with the board. A 5% stake in Tesla is worth more than $30 billion. In comparison, legendary activist investor Nelson Peltz took on the Walt Disney board after building a stake valued at about $3.5 billion at its peak. Activist investors often typically target small-cap publicly traded companies. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Musk shared his view on his ownership stake in response to an analyst’s question about how comfortable the CEO was in evolving Tesla in new directions with only the 13% stake. Musk pointed the annual shareholder meeting, which will be held November 6, as a potential issue to get aired out then. “I think that, as I’ve mentioned before, I think my control over Tesla should be enough to ensure that it goes in a good direction, but not so much control that I can’t be thrown out if I go crazy,” he said. Musk has been working without a base salary or annual bonus for years, after the Tesla board granted him a moonshot pay package once valued as high as $56 billion—the highest for a publicly traded CEO. However, that pay package was twice rescinded by a judge and Tesla has announced it formed a board committee to hash out next steps. With the delay in Tesla’s annual shareholder meeting, the company has not yet published a proxy report to shareholders, which typically includes executive compensation disclosures. Tesla reported mixed results in its second quarter financials on Wednesday. Revenue declined 12% year-over-year to $22.5 billion, its worst revenue performance in the past decade. Operating income dropped 42% year-over-year to under $1 billion, although Tesla was still profitable with $1.2 billion in GAAP net income. Meanwhile, free cash flow cratered 89% year-over-year to $146 million, compared to $1.3 billion during the same quarter last year. Deliveries were down 13% to 384,122, although there were some major developments noted. Tesla launched its much-ballyhooed Robotaxi pilot in Austin, and it boosted its AI training capacity. Separately, Tesla opened a new diner and drive-in theater at a mega charging station in Hollywood this week. Tesla executives did not address speculation about a Tesla investment in Musk’s xAI, nor did they address questions from retail investors about Musk’s involvement in politics and its impact on Tesla’s value. Retail investors post questions on an open platform for Tesla shareholders called Say in advance of the earnings releases. Many related to Musk had to do with his compensation and the board’s plan to oversee Musk’s future political moves. “Elon the person has freedom of speech,” wrote one shareholder representing 47,000 shares. “The brand ambassador of Tesla does not. What is the board doing to distance Tesla from the private actions of its CEO?” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

When a company issues a token representing a real-world asset, such as a stock, but it doesn’t have any right to the underlying, “what you’re really doing is taking away from the integrity of investing and moving towards a gambling mindset,” he told Decrypt in a recent interview. “This is the meme-coin-ification of equities,” he added. In 2023, Kaplan testified before lawmakers on Capitol Hill that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had clearly laid out a path to compliance for crypto firms, provoking scrutiny from Republicans and crypto advocates who argued the status quo is unworkable. With tokenization gaining traction under a crypto-friendly SEC following the reelection of U.S. President Donald Trump, Prometheum is trying to reposition itself as a firm specializing in on-chain securities, reprising a familiar tune, but in a slightly different way. “It’s not really a pivot,” Kaplan said. “We've been working with issuers for a long time, and we're very excited for more and more products to come on-chain.” Through a panoply of licenses and subsidiaries, Kaplan said Prometheum can service the “entire lifecycle of a digital asset,” using its transfer agent, alternative trading system, and a special-purpose broker dealer, which also serves as a custodian. Kaplan said Prometheum can currently safeguard a handful of tokens but on-chain securities are coming next. From the beginning, Kaplan said that Prometheum’s goal has been to “to integrate blockchain technology into market infrastructure to just create a better apple cart,” following the same rules but “eliminating the drag that occurs from legacy systems.” The vision parallels BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who predicted tokenization would become the “next generation of markets” by making markets more efficient in 2022. Citadel Securities, one of the world’s largest market makers, urged the SEC in a letter earlier this week to treat tokenized equities in a similar manner to traditional counterparts. “Simply put, while we strongly support technological innovations designed to address market inefficiencies, seeking to exploit regulatory arbitrage for ‘look-a-like’ securities is not innovation,” it argued, calling on the SEC to “resist self-serving requests for broad exemptions.” In a statement weeks ago, SEC Commissioner and crypto task force boss Hester Peirce told firms structuring tokenized offerings to consider meeting with the regulator, noting that tokenization does not provide an exemption from existing rules and regulations. In recent months, crypto exchange Kraken has backed xStocks on Solana, while trading platform Robinhood has introduced “stocks tokens” on the Ethereum scaling network Arbitrum. Robinhood clarified, following criticism from OpenAI, that its tokens represent contracts, and in the case of the ChatGPT maker, they give “indirect exposure to public markets.” Earlier this month, Securitize CEO Carlos Domingo argued to Decrypt that the only true form of tokenization is “native,” meaning the asset itself is issued on-chain, as opposed to representing an asset that’s held, managed, and recorded somewhere else. Kaplan agrees, but he thinks not all companies are getting the compliance element. “I think people have started to view tokenization as an alternative to regulation,” he said. “It might be a derivative, but it's a security, and therefore it still has to follow the rules.” CORRECTION (JULY 23, 2025, 4:40 p.m.): Fixes title in headline to Co-CEO.

Title: President Trump Plans to Open 401(k)s to Bitcoin, Crypto, Gold, and Private Equity: FT

Editor Crypto Bitcoin Magazine, Oscar Zarraga Perez The executive order, expected this week, aims to unlock the $9 trillion retirement market by allowing 401(k) plans to invest in alternative assets. Financial Times reported today that President Trump is preparing to sign an executive order that would allow 401(k) retirement plans to invest in alternative assets such as gold, private equity, and cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. “Donald Trump is preparing to open the $9tn US retirement market to cryptocurrency investments, gold, and private equity in a move that would spur a radical shift in the way Americans’ savings are managed,” reported the Financial Times. According to Financial Times, the order is expected this week and will direct federal regulators to remove barriers preventing 401(k) plans from including these non-traditional investments in managed funds. This includes digital assets, metals, private loans, infrastructure deals, and corporate buyout funds. “President Trump is committed to restoring prosperity for everyday Americans and safeguarding their economic future,” said the White House in a statement to the Financial Times. “No decisions should be deemed official, however, unless they come from President Trump himself.” Trump’s move builds on his administration’s earlier efforts to ease bitcoin and crypto regulations. In May, the Department of Labor reversed a rule that discouraged bitcoin and other crypto in retirement plans. Trump has also supported recent bitcoin and other crypto related bills passed by the House and credited the industry with helping him win the 2024 election. The executive order could benefit major private investment firms such as Blackstone, Apollo, and BlackRock, reported the Financial Times, which have all pinned much of their future growth on investing money on behalf of retirement savers. “Blackstone has struck a partnership with Vanguard, while Apollo and Partners Group are among firms that will offer investments to Empower, a large 401k plan sponsor. BlackRock has already begun working with Great Gray Trust, a third-party manger of retirement savings plans,” stated Financial Times.

Title: Project Flash update: Advancing Azure Virtual Machine availability monitoring
URL: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/project-flash-update-advancing-azure-virtual-machine-availability-monitoring-2/
Time Published: 2025-07-23T16:00:00Z
Full Content:
Previously, we shared an update on Project Flash as part of our Advancing Reliability blog series, reaffirming our commitment to helping Azure customers detect and diagnose virtual machine (VM) availability issues with speed and precision. This year, we’re excited to unveil the latest innovations that take VM availability monitoring to the next level—enabling customers to operate their workloads on Azure with even greater confidence. I’ve asked Yingqi (Halley) Ding, Technical Program Manager from the Azure Core Compute team, to walk us through the newest investments powering the next phase of Project Flash. Project Flash is a cross-division initiative at Microsoft. Its vision is to deliver precise telemetry, real-time alerts, and scalable monitoring—all within a unified, user-friendly experience designed to meet the diverse observability needs of virtual machine (VM) availability. Flash addresses both platform-level and user-level challenges. It enables rapid detection of issues originating from the Azure platform, helping teams respond quickly to infrastructure-related disruptions. At the same time, it equips you with actionable insights to diagnose and resolve problems within your own environment. This dual capability supports high availability and helps ensure your business Service-Level Agreements are consistently met. It’s our mission to ensure you can: During our team’s journey with Flash, it has garnered widespread adoption from some of the world’s leading companies spanning from e-commerce, gaming, finance, hedge funds, and many other sectors. Their extensive utilization of Flash underscores its effectiveness and value in meeting the diverse needs of high-profile organizations. At BlackRock, VM reliability is critical to our operations. If a VM is running on degraded hardware, we want to be alerted quickly so we have the maximum opportunity to mitigate the issue before it impacts users. With Project Flash, we receive a resource health event integrated into our alerting processes the moment an underlying node in Azure infrastructure is marked unallocatable, typically due to health degradation. Our infrastructure team then schedules a migration of the affected resource to healthy hardware at an optimal time. This ability to predictively avoid abrupt VM failures has reduced our VM interruption rate and improved the overall reliability of our investment platform. The Flash initiative has evolved into a robust, scalable monitoring framework designed to meet the diverse needs of modern infrastructure—whether you’re managing a handful of VMs or operating at massive scale. Built with reliability at its core, Flash empowers you to monitor what matters most, using the tools and telemetry that align with your architecture and operational model. Flash publishes VM availability states and resource health annotations for detailed failure attribution and downtime analysis. The guide below outlines your options so you can choose the right Flash monitoring solution for your scenario. Many customers have emphasized the need for user-friendly monitoring solutions that provide real-time, scalable access to compute resource availability data. This information is essential for triggering timely mitigation actions in response to availability changes. Designed to satisfy this critical need, the VM availability metric is well-suited for tracking trends, aggregating platform metrics (such as CPU and disk usage), and configuring precise threshold-based alerts. You can utilize this out-of-the-box VM availability metric in Azure Monitor. Now you can use the Context dimension to identify whether VM availability was influenced by Azure or user-orchestrated activity. This dimension indicates, during any disruption or when the metric drops to zero, whether the cause was platform-triggered or user-driven. It can assume values of Platform, Customer, or Unknown. The new dimension is also supported in Azure Monitor alert rules as part of the filtering process. Azure Event Grid is a highly scalable, fully managed Pub/Sub message distribution service that offers flexible message consumption patterns. Event Grid enables you to publish and subscribe to messages to support Internet of Things (IoT) solutions. Through HTTP, Event Grid enables you to build event-driven solutions, where a publisher service (such as Project Flash) announces its system state changes (events) to subscriber applications. With the integration of Azure Monitor alerts as a new event handler, you can now receive low-latency notifications—such as VM availability changes and detailed annotations—via SMS, email, push notifications, and more. This combines Event Grid’s near real-time delivery with Azure Monitor’s direct alerting capabilities. To get started, simply follow the step-by-step instructions and begin receiving real-time alerts with Flash’s new offering. Looking ahead, we plan to broaden our focus to include scenarios such as inoperable top-of-rack switches, failures in accelerated networking, and new classes of hardware failure prediction. In addition, we aim to continue enhancing data quality and consistency across all Flash endpoints—enabling more accurate downtime attribution and deeper visibility into VM availability. For comprehensive monitoring of VM availability—including scenarios such as routine maintenance, live migration, service healing, and degradation—we recommend leveraging both Flash Health events and Scheduled Events (SE). For upcoming updates on the Flash initiative, we encourage you to follow the advancing reliability series! The future of AI starts here. Envision your next great AI app with the latest technologies.

The product, built with technology developed by Goldman Sachs, will allow fund managers to enable the subscription of shares of MMF via BNY’s Liquidity Direct and digital assets platform that are then reflected with mirrored tokens on Goldman Sachs's Digital Asset Platform (DAP). “As the financial system transitions toward a more digital, real-time architecture, BNY is committed to enabling scalable and secure solutions that shape the future of finance,” said Global Head of Liquidity, Financing and Collateral at BNY Laide Majiyagbe in a statement. "Mirrored tokenization of MMF shares is a first step in this transition, and we are proud to be at the forefront of this first-of-its-kind initiative," she added. The initial launch will have participation from BlackRock, BNY Investments Dreyfus, Federated Hermes, Fidelity Investments, and Goldman Sachs Asset Management, while the official books, records, and settlement will be maintained by BNY Mellon. “Using tokens representing the value of shares of Money Market Funds on GS DAP would enable us to unlock their utility as a form of collateral and open up more seamless transferability in the future,” said Goldman Sachs Global Head of Digital Assets Matthew McDermott, in a statement. “We are excited about this strategic collaboration with BNY in our journey towards the longer-term vision for GS DAP and as we continue to lead and innovate in the digital assets space.” Expanding participation in global financial services via tokenized assets is a growing trend among financial firms. Last month, Robinhood announced a tokenized equity platform to provide greater access to American stocks for those in the Europe, and American crypto exchange Coinbase is seeking to offer its own tokenized solution as well. Meanwhile, other crypto exchanges have leaned into offering xStocks, a feature that allows users to trade popular stocks like Meta and Tesla on Solana, which are backed by actual shares in the respective companies.

The DORKs are popular this week. With stocks at record highs, there's a new class of meme stocks that's grabbed the attention of retail traders. Absent are the OG meme names GameStop and AMC. Those early favorites have been replaced by another group. The DORKs—an acronym being thrown around by bullish traders to refer to the ticker symbols of Krispy Kreme, Opendoor, Rocket Companies, and Kohl's—are spiking in the last few days, with the burst of enthusiasm sparked by a stunning rally in Opendoor stock that's mostly cooled off even as the rest of the group surges. It's looking similar to 2021, when everything from crypto to pandemic-era blank check firms to highly-shorted companies with weak financials were getting pushed to dizzying heights. And with recent legislation proposing to loosen day trading restrictions by lowering the minimum margin account threshold, there's never been a more retail-friendly time in the markets. But there are differences, too, between today's rally and the pandemic-era frenzy. "Today's surge is powered by advances in trading technology, wider use of leverage, and the rapid expansion of the options market. Confidence among retail traders is notably higher, fueled in part by recent gains in crypto markets," Mark Hackett, chief market strategist at Nationwide, said. "While this activity reflects rising risk appetite, it remains isolated and has yet to challenge the broader market's calm and steady tone." Taking a page from Warren Buffett's book, investors are getting greedy, which also means extra caution may be warranted. Tony DeSpirito, global CIO of US fundamental equities at BlackRock, is sensing some pockets of froth in the market as sentiment continues to rise and meme stocks surge. In particular, stocks with high multiples but low growth are concerning to DeSpirito. "Meme stocks are the epitome of greed," DeSpirito told Business Insider. "If I'm advising an individual, I'd tell them to stay away from the meme stocks and get the stocks that actually have good cash flow, good earnings, etc." Here's what's been moving in the meme stock world. Prior to last week, Opendoor was an unloved penny stock on the verge of delisting from the Nasdaq. After hedge fund manager Eric Jackson shouted out the stock on X and gave it a hefty $82 price target, enthusiasm for Opendoor surged, activating the retail trader cohort who quickly went all-in. The stock has rallied over 440% in the last month alone, going from under a dollar to $2.88, even hitting $4.71 briefly at one point on Monday. The rally has stalled in recent days, with the shares down as much as 28% on Wednesday. The stock is still up 310% in the last month. Kohl's stock jumped 38% on Tuesday, not on the heels of corporate news or earnings, but rather r/WallStreetBets chatter. Retail traders identified a short interest of nearly half of the company's float, making the stock a perfect candidate for a short squeeze. The frenzy caused trading in Kohl's shares to be temporarily paused during Tuesday's session. The doughnut chain Krispy Kreme surged 28% on Tuesday. The stock started 2025 trading at nearly $10 and proceeded to slide downwards in the following months after the company reported disappointing earnings—until this week. The stock soared again on Wednesday, up as much as 39%before paring gains. Krispy Kreme also has a significant short interest level of 33%, making it another target for Reddit short squeezers. Digital camera producer GoPro was also swept up in the meme-stock craze. In its heyday back in 2015, the stock traded at $67. A big influx of retail volume has propelled the stock from under a dollar to above $2 immediately upon Wednesday's open. The stock was up as much as 72% on Wednesday before paring the gain to around 40%. Nearly 10% of GoPro's float is shorted. Jump to

Δ The collaboration will see BNY use Goldman Sachs’ blockchain technology to maintain a record of customers’ ownership of select money market funds (MMFs). The companies said in a Wednesday (July 23) press release that the project is “a significant step towards enhancing the utility and transferability of existing MMF shares.” It’s also the first time that fund managers in the United States have enabled subscription for shares of their MMFs via BNY’s LiquidityDirect and Digital Asset platforms, “the corresponding value of which will be represented through mirrored record tokenization utilizing GS DAP,” Goldman Sachs’ blockchain-based platform, per the release. BlackRock, BNY Investments Dreyfus, Federated Hermes, Fidelity Investments and Goldman Sachs Asset Management are all participating in the launch, the release said. “As the financial system transitions toward a more digital, real-time architecture, BNY is committed to enabling scalable and secure solutions that shape the future of finance,” Laide Majiyagbe, global head of liquidity, financing and collateral at BNY, said in the release. “Mirrored tokenization of MMF shares is a first step in this transition, and we are proud to be at the forefront of this first-of-its-kind initiative.” Mathew McDermott, global head of digital assets at Goldman Sachs, said in the release that using tokens representing the value of shares of MMFs on GS DAP “would enable us to unlock their utility as a form of collateral and open up more seamless transferability in the future.” BNY will continue to maintain the official books, records, and settlements for the funds within approved guidelines while also enabling mirror tokens on GS DAP to create future opportunities, according to the release. Meanwhile, tokenization is transforming the way consumers and merchants think about payment security, Valeri Vanourek, vice president of digital products at Discover® Network, told PYMNTS this month. “The benefits of tokenization haven’t changed,” Vanourek said. “A streamlined checkout process, additional protection as part of the transaction, the account updates in the case of a cardholder’s primary account number being lost or stolen or needing to be replaced, all of those result in a frictionless and secure transaction.” What has changed is that companies that choose to invest in tokenization for their payment architecture could be best placed to flourish in the next wave of digital commerce.

Title: What’s up with… Nokia, AT&T, Comcast, Charter, T-Mobile US
URL: https://www.telecomtv.com/content/digital-platforms-services/what-s-up-with-nokia-at-t-comcast-charter-t-mobile-us-53498/
Time Published: 2025-07-23T14:06:52Z
Full Content:
Jul 23, 2025 In today’s industry news roundup: Currency exchange fluctuations and tariffs force Nokia to issue a profits warning for the full year; AT&T is to pump billions more into its fibre access network infrastructure as it celebrates massive tax savings from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act; Comcast and Charter have hooked up with T-Mobile US, and not existing MVNO partner Verizon, for B2B mobile services; and much more! Nokia’s share price slumped by 8.5% to €3.76 during Wednesday trading on the Helsinki stock exchange after the vendor issued a profit warning late on Tuesday, blaming foreign exchange rate fluctuations (a weaker dollar) and “tariff headwinds” that are “outside its control”. While the vendor says its “underlying business performed as expected” during the first six months of the year, the foreign exchange shifts and the impact of trade tariffs have forced the company to lower its operating profit outlook for the full year to €1.6bn-2.1bn from its previous outlook of €1.9bn-€2.4bn), a difference of €300m. The main impact has come from the change in the exchange rate between the euro and the US dollar: When Nokia made its initial full year calculations in January, the €/$ exchange rate was 1.04, but its new calculation is based on a rate of 1.17. That shift has had a €230m negative impact on its operating profit projection, while the “tariff landscape” is expected to have a negative impact this year of between €50m and €80m. Nokia is set to publish its second quarter 2025 results during the morning of 24 July but ahead of that publication it noted that it expects to report revenues of €4.55bn and an operating profit of €300m. Nokia, of course, won’t be alone in taking this kind of hit: Other European vendors that do a lot of business in the US will also be impacted by the same “headwinds”, especially if the US does impose 30% tariffs on EU goods from 1 August, as has been threatened. AT&T expects to benefit from cash tax savings worth between $6.5bn and $8bn during the 2025-2027 period, relative to the financial guidance it provided at its 2024 investor day, due to the impact of the Trump administration’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The telco expects savings of $1.5bn-$2bn this year, followed by $2.5bn-$3bn in 2026 and again in 2027. The news came as the operator reported its second quarter financial results. AT&T says it plans to invest $3.5bn of those expected savings into its network infrastructure to “accelerate its fibre internet build-out to a pace of 4 million locations per year, a run-rate it expects to achieve by the end of 2026.” The telco added: “As a result of this increased pace of organic fibre deployment, AT&T expects that by the end of 2030 it will reach approximately 50 million customer locations with its in-region fibre network,” and more than 60 million fibre locations once it includes: the Lumen Technologies Mass Markets fibre broadband network assets it has agreed to acquire for $5.75bn (and which it plans to expand); its Gigapower joint venture with Blackrock; and agreements with open access fibre broadband network providers. As for the rest of the savings, AT&T plans to pump $1.5bn into its employee pension plan by the end of 2026 and use the remaining savings for “financial flexibility to support additional strategic investments, incremental capital returns and debt repayment, among other potential uses.” For the second quarter, AT&T reported communications services revenues of $29.7bn, up by 3.9% year on year, and communications services operating profits of $7.07bn, up by 0.9%. US cable operator giants Comcast and Charter Communications have struck a joint (and exclusive) MVNO (mobile virtual network operator) deal with T-Mobile US to offer mobile services to their enterprise customers. Mobile services will be offered by Charter and Comcast to US businesses under the Spectrum Mobile for Business and Comcast Business Mobile brands, respectively, noted T-Mobile US in this announcement. Edward Zimmermann, president of Comcast Business, stated: “Comcast Business delivers advanced, converged solutions to business customers by uniting the scale of our nationwide WiFi network, gig-plus speeds, and the integration of top-tier 5G mobile capabilities. Our capital-light partnership with T-Mobile further strengthens our growth strategy in wireless for business customers and provides them exceptional value.” Danny Bowman, executive VP for Product at Charter Communications, added: “Spectrum Mobile for Business offers a truly converged connectivity experience, combining gig-powered internet and superior WiFi service with a premium 5G mobile network. This partnership with T-Mobile will allow us to rapidly and cost-effectively bring even more value to our Spectrum Mobile business customers.” The deal is great news for the wholesale unit of T-Mobile US, which is not shy in telling the world how advanced its 5G network is, but something of a blow to Verizon, which already provides MVNO services to Comcast and Charter for their consumer mobile service offerings – Xfinity Mobile (8.1 million customers) and Spectrum Mobile (10.4 million customers), respectively. The cable companies have stressed that their “existing long-term MVNO partnership will continue to support residential and current business customers”. That’s a small crumb of comfort for Verizon, which will now face even fiercer competition in the enterprise mobile services space from the cable giants. Of course, AT&T and T-Mobile US will also face similar competitive pressure in the B2B market, but at least T-Mobile US will be reaping the rewards of the MVNO fees from Comcast and Charter. Research firm Omdia has taken a look at what Asia’s cloud service providers – including SK Telecom and China’s cloud providers such as Alibaba, Baidu, Huawei and Tencent – are doing in order to meet the rising demand for AI inference from the region’s enterprise sector. By examining which GPUs (graphics processing units), AI accelerators and AI-optimised CPUs (central processing units) these companies have deployed, and the current status of their own AI models and custom chip projects, as well as their AI service and pricing plans, it has come up with an interesting take on the sector. “Despite heavy stockpiling of Nvidia H800 and H20 GPUs during 2024 and early 2025, prior to the imposition of US export controls, these high-performance chips are difficult to find in Chinese cloud services, suggesting they are primarily used for the hyperscalers’ own model development projects,” noted Omdia in this announcement. At the same time, “there are relatively few options that use any of the Chinese AI chip projects; exceptions include Baidu’s on-premises cloud products and some Huawei Cloud services, although they remain limited,” it added. Omdia principal analyst Alexander Harrowell noted: “The real triumph in Chinese semiconductors has been CPUs rather than accelerators. Chinese Arm-based CPUs are clearly in production at scale and are usually optimised for parallel workloads in a way like Amazon Web Services’ Graviton series. Products such as Alibaba’s YiTian 710 offer an economically attractive solution for serving the current generation of small AI models such as Alibaba Qwen3 in the enterprise, where the user base is relatively small and workload diversity is high,” he added. Where “modern GPUs” are deployed, “the strongest offering Omdia found was the GPU-as-a-service product SK Telecom is building in partnership with Lambda Labs,” the research firm noted. Philippines operator Globe Telecom has committed to power 3,000 cell sites in Metro Manila and Calabarzon with 100% renewable power in a move that will lead to the consumption of 80 million kWh of clean electricity and cut its greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 5.5 million kilograms, reports Southeast Asia Infrastructure. Research firm Mobile Experts has taken a broad look at the impact of AI on mobile networks and concluded that “AI assistants and AR [augmented reality] will strain the 5G network, but AI-for-RAN optimization [the use of AI to enhance the performance and efficiency of radio access networks] will create more capacity than consumer applications will use, at least through 2030. The wild card is in automated use of AI for video analysis, in automotive, drone, and industrial applications.” Joe Madden, principal analyst at Mobile Experts, stated: "New applications are coming to your smartphone, taking advantage of on-device AI processing capability. We have been able to identify which apps will run on your phone, and which ones will require network connectivity. The frame rates, resolution, and persistence of video inputs will have a profound impact on the 5G network," added Madden. – The staff, TelecomTV Jul 25, 2025 Jul 25, 2025 Jul 25, 2025 Jul 25, 2025 Jul 25, 2025 Sign up to receive TelecomTV's top news and videos, plus exclusive subscriber-only content direct to your inbox.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo Goldman Sachs and BNY have joined hands to launch digital tokens that mirror shares of money market funds, deepening Wall Street's push to bring blockchain technology into traditional finance. Investors can now buy and sell money market fund shares on BNY's LiquidityDirect platform, with a digital record of those shares created on Goldman's blockchain system, the two financial giants said on Wednesday. The move marks an early step toward modernizing the infrastructure that underpins most of the financial ecosystem. If adopted broadly, it could make it easier and faster for institutional investors to use these assets as collateral and reduce trade settlement times. BlackRock, BNY Investments Dreyfus, Federated Hermes, Fidelity Investments and Goldman Sachs Asset Management are among the companies participating in the initial rollout.

Due to its 71.6% monthly rise, per CoinGecko, XRP has surpassed drinks company PepsiCo, telecommunications firm AT&T, and taxi app Uber. Ethereum, by comparison, is the 29th largest asset, ahead of the likes of retail company Cotco and medical firm Johnson & Johnson. As for Bitcoin, it currently sits as the 6th largest asset behind Amazon and ahead of Google's creator, Alphabet. However, one expert warns against treating the market capitalization of a public company and a cryptocurrency as the same thing. "It's important that the two concepts are not treated the same," Matej Janež, Head of Partnerships at crypto privacy firm Oasis, told Decrypt. "A public company's market cap counts shares that confer a legal claim on earnings and assets. A crypto market cap is the price multiplied by the circulating token count. Both numbers can reveal speculative appetite, but only one comes with enforceable rights to dividends and residual assets." XRP set a new all-time high earlier this month for the first time in seven years. It came following a five-year legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which alleged that Ripple and two of its executives had participated in the sale of unregistered securities through XRP. The worst of the legal battle appears to be behind the project as President Trump’s pro-crypto administration begins to ease regulatory scrutiny. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse even claimed the battle was over in March, despite some details of the lawsuit—a $125 million penalty—still lingering. Since Trump secured re-election in November 2024, XRP has surged 585.8% from $0.503 to $3.44. That move has seen the cryptocurrency surpass the likes of investment titan BlackRock, aircraft creator Boeing, and sporting giant Nike. “PesiCo, Uber, BlackRock, Google, Uber will remain in the dust because of XRP. [It] will continue to grow and grow because it has real value,” MackAttackXRP, a pseudonymous member of the XRP Army, an avid supporters group, told Decrypt. “XRP is on its way to the top ten. And it might happen sooner than many might think.” For XRP to climb into the top 10, the cryptocurrency would need to jump more than 735% in value—assuming no other assets increase or decrease in value. MackAttackXRP and other XRP Army troopers argue that XRP will become the standard for transactions across the globe, replacing the traditional banking system, because of its low fees and fast processing speeds. Breaking into the top 10 remains some distance away for XRP, however. Looking to a more achievable goal, XRP needs to rise just 5% to surpass fast-food behemoth McDonald’s. Such a move would also see it surpass oil company Shell and banking firm American Express.

Title: Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon to launch tokenized money market funds for institutional investors

Share this article Goldman Sachs and BNY are launching a new platform that allows institutional clients to invest in tokenized money market funds, CNBC reported Wednesday, and it already has backing from titans like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Federated Hermes. Under the initiative, BNY clients, such as hedge funds, pensions, and corporate treasurers, will gain access to tokenized fund share classes recorded directly on Goldman’s private blockchain. Tokenized money market shares promise an alternative to stablecoins. Unlike stablecoins, money market funds generate real returns, making them a compelling on-chain instrument for parking idle capital with low risk and high liquidity. In March 2024, Goldman Sachs, BNY, and other financial institutions participated in a network test on Digital Asset’s Canton Network to facilitate seamless transactions and settlements of tokenized assets. The pilot involved 15 asset managers, 13 banks, four custodians, and three exchanges, demonstrating the potential of enterprise blockchain to reduce risks, optimize capital, and enable more efficient financial processes.

Title: Overnight sensation Thomas Clarkson taking advantage of surprise Lions call-up

If ever there was a five-year overnight sensation it is assuredly Thomas Clarkson. He made his Leinster debut in August 2020 but went into this campaign with less than 20 starts under his belt and as his province’s third choice tighthead. Yet there he was on Tuesday night in the Marvel Stadium mixed zone after the 24-19 win over the Pasifika XV, a bona fide British & Irish Lion. No one seemed more incredulous as well as delighted than the 25-year-old himself, for he freely admitted he wouldn’t have thought all of this was possible when he was named as one of the additional, or development, players to train with Ireland’s squad last November, before making his debut against Argentina off the bench, backing it up against Fiji, and then playing in four Six Nations games, starting against Wales. Clarkson is eligible for Italy on his mother’s side and also revealed he was approached by Italy at the start of last season. “I wasn’t even really expecting to play in that. So, to get a cap I was delighted. “The Six Nations; I was happy enough with how it went. I wouldn’t have said I set the world alight or anything. So, to then play well for Leinster at the end of the season and come in here, it’s pretty mad.” As recently as January 2025, Clarkson was playing an AIL Division 1B game for Blackrock. “I made my Leinster debut five years ago now, so I’ve been waiting a long time. So, the fact that when it has come, it’s all come at once is a bit crazy. Because I went through a good few years of not getting a sniff in at all really.” It’s been a Lions tour of an unprecedented and, frankly, unexpected bounty for Irish tightheads, three of them making the tour. And two of whom are inextricably linked. Had it not been for the calf and hamstring issues which restricted Tadhg Furlong to just seven games for Leinster and one for Ireland, Clarkson would never have had the opportunities that came for province and country. Even so, after adding three more Champions Cup pool games to his one outing before this season, Clarkson didn’t make the Leinster 23 in their European knockout games. But with Furlong sidelined again, Leo Cullen started Clarkson in their round 18 game against Glasgow. “It all kind of just clicked and then kept that momentum going. That was the first game when I thought: ‘That was a proper performance’.” David Humphreys has now lifted his moratorium on the provinces signing props from abroad and although Furlong’s injury woes have been a factor, Clarkson’s own account of his growth this season shows how Irish players can learn from overseas acquisitions like Rabah Slimani. “I’ve been kind of understudy to Tadhg for a good few years now. He’s consistently been probably the best tighthead in the world over the last few years. It’s been unbelievable being there, just around him. “Rabah’s come in and probably offered something a bit different, where he’s 100 per cent scrum. Tadhg obviously has an array of different stuff that he brings to it, whereas Rabah, when you’re scrumming against him in training, it’s all or nothing against him. It’s been a different kind of experience with him, but I’ve felt I’ve come out the other end well.” Clarkson retained his starting place at tighthead in the URC quarter-final, semi-final and final wins, before playing against Georgia and Portugal. That Saturday night in Lisbon, he thought his breakthrough season was done until he received a text from Andy Farrell at 3am. “We were on a night out; I had to go home straight away. But yeah, some text to get. It was like: ‘ring me when you’re awake’, so I said: ‘Oh yeah, grand’. Then Paulie [O’Connell] rang me and was like: ‘Ring him right now’. So yeah, I had to just compose myself and go outside. I told Jack Boyle and then just legged it.” Sadly, social media can be a nasty world, and on foot of the backlash to him and Jamie Osborne being called up, Clarkson opted to ignore it. “I feel like the last few weeks in Leinster, before the semi-final, was fairly negative. I just tried to use that as a bit of motivation. I knew, just because Jamie got called in right before me, there was a bit of backlash to that. So, I knew it was going to be even more when I got the nod. So yeah, I just tried to stay away from it.” “It was a bit of a shock at the start, to be honest. You grow up using social media. It was hard to step away from it. But I just had to get rid of a lot of that.” Clarkson admits that linking up with the Lions at short notice was a good deal easier for him than the late Scottish call-ups given his familiarity with so many players and coaches, not least Andy Farrell and John Fogarty. On Tuesday morning Fogarty told Clarkson that his form for Leinster merited his call-up and encouraged him to continue that form into the match that night, so building up his confidence. “I felt like I was chasing my tail a little bit, but happy enough with the scrum and I made a few tackles. It was a good start.” To make Clarkson’s landmark night even better, his father Finbarr made it out in time for Tuesday’s match. “I think he knew if he was going to be here for any game, it would be this game. So yeah, he legged it down.” All the while in the mixed zone, he still had his Lions cap in his grasp, which had been given to him by Ieuen Evans. “It’s crazy, 886,” he says, of his number in Lions’ playing history. “I didn’t even know they did caps if you don’t play in the Test.” He’s a Lion now all right.

Title: Italian call a distant memory for new Lion Clarkson

Neil Treacy RTÉ Sport Journalist As Thomas Clarkson stood in Melbourne's Marvel Stadium, clutching his newly minted British and Irish Lions cap, he reflected on a sliding doors moment from two years earlier. Fun fact: The 25-year-old's full name is actually Tommaso Clarkson, with his mother Nina Cafolla coming from a small town between Rome and Naples. At the start of the 2023/24 season, the Italians came calling. Clarkson turned down the offer, but with the tighthead prop yet to get his full break at Leinster, his qualification to play for Italy was kept in his back pocket, just in case. "They came looking for me, but I'd just signed a new contract with Leinster," he said, after making his Lions debut against the First Nations and Pasifika XV on Tuesday night. "I thought it could be open at some point down the line, but obviously, this year it's gone very well." It's been a fast 12 months for Clarkson. A run of games to start the season, and injuries elsewhere, saw him brought into the Ireland squad for the first time in November as a training panellist. He was retained after the training camp and impressed in two appearances off the bench against Argentina and Fiji. More big appearances came in the Champions Cup, and four more Irish caps followed in the Six Nations, before he produced arguably his best Leinster performance in their URC final win against the Bulls, a game he says was the moment where he believes he arrived. "It all kind of just clicked [that day] and then kept that momentum going," he said. "That was the first game when I was like, 'that was a proper performance’." He thought he finished the season with two more Irish caps against Georgia and Portugal, scoring a try in the second of those wins, and it was while celebrating that victory with a few beers in the early hours of the morning in Lisbon that he received an urgent message from Andy Farrell. "It was like: ‘ring me when you’re awake’, so I said ‘oh yeah, grand’. Then Paulie [Paul O’Connell] rang me and was like, ‘ring him right now!’ "So yeah, I had to just compose myself and go outside. "I told Jack Boyle and then just legged it." His dream Lions call-up wasn’t met with universal warmth outside of Ireland, mainly due to the him being the 18th Irish international drafted in by Farrell on this tour, and the third tighthead prop. Farrell made a point of namechecking Clarkson (above) after last night’s game, insisting he was very much the "next cab on the rank" when he was called into the group, and the player says that message has been drilled into him by the coaching staff. "It wasn't a kind of ‘nepo’ selection if you’d call it that," Clarkson added. "It was just nice to hear going into it. We were bouncing into the game. "I benefited from Tadhg [Furlong] being injured at the end of the season, definitely benefited from that. "But I'd like to think I took the opportunity. "I've been kind of understudied to Tadhg for a good few years now. He's consistently been probably the best tighthead in the world over the last few years. "It's been unbelievable being there, just around him. "Rabah’s [Rabah Slimani] come in, probably offered something a bit different, where he's 100% scrum. "Tadhg obviously has an array of different stuff that he brings to it. Whereas Rabah, when you're scrumming against him in training, it's all or nothing." While the breaks have fallen his way this season, he served a long apprenticeship at the province, in large part down to playing behind Furlong, as well as Michael Ala’alatoa in previous years. Remarkably, he was lining out for Blackrock College in Division 1B of the Energia All-Ireland League as recently as January 2024. Asked if he though playing for the Lions was on the cards even six months ago, he admitted "not a hope!". "I made my Leinster debut five years ago now, so I've been waiting a long time," he said. "The fact that when it has come, it's all come at once is a bit crazy. Because I went through a good few years of not getting a sniff in at all really. So yeah, it’s mad. "I put a lot of work into getting it, so any time I did get a shot, there was a whole lot of work behind it. So it felt like it just kind of rolled into another. "Once I got a foot in the door, I think I was trying to open it fully." Barring a couple of injuries, it’s likely Clarkson has now finally finished his gruelling, 27-game season, and will head home with something to remember it by. "It’s crazy, 886," he says, repeating the number stitched into his red and gold Lions cap after Tuesday’s win. "I didn't even know they did caps if you don't play in the Test. It's some energy."

Business FILE PHOTO: Representations of cryptocurrencies are seen in front of displayed decreasing stock graph in this illustration taken November 10, 2022. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File photo NEW YORK :Tokenization has long been a buzzword for crypto enthusiasts, who have been arguing for years that blockchain-based assets will change the underlying infrastructure of financial markets. The technology is seen as rapidly increasing in coming years, especially in the U.S., helped by the passage of three new bills. President Donald Trump's administration has eased regulation of the broader crypto industry, paving the way for a boom in the valuation of companies in the sector and the rapid growth of crypto-related securities. However, the growth of the market for tokenized assets has been far slower than expected in recent years, with many projects still in their infancy or not yet live. HOW DOES TOKENIZATION WORK?

But it generally refers to the process of turning financial assets - such as bank deposits, stocks, bonds, funds and even real estate - into crypto assets.This means creating a record on digital ledger blockchain that represents the original asset. These blockchain-based assets, or "tokens", can be held in crypto wallets and traded on blockchain, just like cryptocurrencies. WHERE DO STABLECOINS COME IN?Stablecoins can be seen as an example of tokenization. They are a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a constant value by being pegged to a real-world currency, typically the U.S. dollar. The issuer holds one U.S. dollar in reserve for every dollar-pegged crypto token it creates.Stablecoins are blockchain-based tokens acting as a proxy for an asset that already exists outside the blockchain.They allow people to move money across borders without interacting with the banking system. While critics say that this makes them useful for criminals who want to avoid banks' anti-money laundering checks, stablecoin issuers say that they are a lifeline for people in countries without a developed payments system. ARE TOKENIZED ASSETS TAKING OFF?Yes and no. Stablecoins have grown in recent years, with the market estimated to be worth about $256 billion, according to crypto data provider CoinMarketCap, and expected to touch $2 trillion by 2028, according to Standard Chartered.But banks have talked for years about creating tokenized versions of other types of assets, which they say will make trading more efficient, faster and cheaper, and those "tokens" have struggled to gain traction.While there have been individual issuances, there is not a liquid secondary market for these kinds of assets.One impediment to trading traditional assets via blockchain is that banks are working on their own private networks, making it difficult to trade across platforms.WHAT ARE THE PROS OF TOKENIZATION?Some proponents of the crypto industry have said tokenization can improve liquidity in the financial system. Illiquid assets like real estate could be traded more easily if they are broken up into small digital tokens.It is also expected to improve access to asset classes that are typically out of reach of smaller investors by creating a cheaper entry point.WHICH COMPANIES ARE INTERESTED IN TOKENIZATION?Some major global banks, including Bank of America and Citi have said they could explore launching tokenized assets, including stablecoins.Asset manager BlackRock is also doubling down on the tokenization boom, and has highlighted its ambition of becoming the largest cryptocurrency manager in the world by 2030.Coinbase, the largest U.S. crypto exchange, is seeking permission from the SEC to offer "tokenized equities" to its customers. HOW DOES NEW REGULATION HELP TOKENIZATION? Since stablecoins themselves are tokens and seen as one of the biggest drivers of the growth of tokenization, the new stablecoin law will end up boosting the proliferation of tokenization, experts say. The new market structure bill, known as the Clarity Act, is expected to establish a clear framework that could enable stablecoins and other crypto tokens to become more widely used. WHAT ARE THE RISKS?Some analysts say the hype around tokenization might be premature and caution that the rapidly growing crypto ecosystem could experience near-term turbulence due to the potential risks of a big decline in prices. European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde has warned stablecoins pose risks for monetary policy and financial stability.Some critics of the industry warn the frenzy around the new technology could introduce new systemic risks, especially in the absence of stringent regulation. They also say there is no reason why blockchain should be any more efficient than the electronic ledgers and trading systems already used in financial markets.Buyers of third-party tokens, which are issued by unaffiliated third parties - such as crypto exchange Kraken - that have custody of securities, could be exposed to counterparty risks, and regulators are sounding notes of caution. Earlier in July, Hester Peirce, a commissioner at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission who has frequently spoken positively about cryptocurrency, said tokenized securities would not be able to circumvent existing securities laws.More than half of the world's U.S. dollar stablecoins are issued by a single company, Tether, which says it manages $160 billion in reserves, but has not undergone a financial audit.

Some analysts say the hype around tokenization might be premature and caution that the rapidly growing crypto ecosystem could experience near-term turbulence due to the potential risks of a big decline in prices. European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde has warned stablecoins pose risks for monetary policy and financial stability. Some critics of the industry warn the frenzy around the new technology could introduce new systemic risks, especially in the absence of stringent regulation. They also say there is no reason why blockchain should be any more efficient than the electronic ledgers and trading systems already used in financial markets. Buyers of third-party tokens, which are issued by unaffiliated third parties - such as crypto exchange Kraken - that have custody of securities, could be exposed to counterparty risks, and regulators are sounding notes of caution. Earlier in July, Hester Peirce, a commissioner at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission who has frequently spoken positively about cryptocurrency, said tokenized securities would not be able to circumvent existing securities laws. More than half of the world's U.S. dollar stablecoins are issued by a single company, Tether, which says it manages $160 billion in reserves, but has not undergone a financial audit.

Title: The stock market is on a hot streak. It’s about to face a huge test | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Six months into President Donald Trump’s second term, a quick glance at the stock market offers a reassuring picture: The S&P 500 just closed above 6,300 points for the first time ever and has notched eight record highs in the past month. If you look at markets halfway into the year, it might not be apparent that there has been unprecedented trade turmoil, conflict in the Middle East and relentless attacks on the Federal Reserve’s independence. The stock market and bitcoin have soared to record highs, while bonds have resumed a steady rally and volatility in oil prices has subsided. Global markets so far this year have been remarkably resilient. The calm mood on Wall Street is an extraordinary change from early April, when the S&P 500 hit its lowest level in over a year and was on the precipice of a bear market after Trump unveiled his initial “Liberation Day” tariffs. “Perhaps the move by US stocks off the early-April lows is emblematic of the age-old adage about bull markets often climbing a ‘wall of worry,’” Liz Ann Sonders and Kevin Gordon, investment strategists at Charles Schwab, said in a note. “There is no shortage of things to worry about; but that’s the wall markets often climb.” Markets are floating near record highs despite underlying tariff uncertainty. While investors have begun to shrug off a myriad of concerns, US stocks are trading at historically expensive valuations as Trump’s self-imposed August 1 tariff deadline approaches. As Trump presses forward with his trade war, markets’ momentum will face a tariff test. “What has held stocks aloft … is the premise that whatever tariff increases come on August 1, they will not be permanent,” Thierry Wizman, global FX and rates strategist at Macquarie Group, said in a note. “The prospect that ‘deals’ will be struck thereafter remains a factor, we believe, in keeping traders from selling stocks more aggressively,” Wizman said. Jeff Buchbinder and Adam Turnquist, strategists at LPL Financial, said in a note that the S&P 500’s “unusually sharp and swift ‘V-shaped recovery’” from its low point in early April was “one of the most powerful post-correction rebounds in stock market history.” The ferocity of the market’s recovery has raised questions about whether it is supported by fundamentals — or if underlying weakness could arise. While the market experienced bouts of enormous volatility in recent months, stocks continue to push higher. The S&P 500 is up 5.2% since Trump took office. Trump has acknowledged the market’s rebound. The president earlier this month told NBC News that “tariffs have been very well received,” noting that the “stock market hit a new high.” The “softening” of initial tariff announcements has “removed the worst-case scenarios” for outlooks for economic growth and inflation, investors at BlackRock said in a note, which has supported the market’s rally. Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers trading platform, told CNN that the rally has also been driven by momentum and a fear of missing out. “Ever since the president’s about-face in early April that turned the market around, a lot of money has been made basically by investors assuming that these tariffs will be postponed, renegotiated or otherwise watered down,” Sosnick said. “And if there’s a trade that works very well for people over a long period of time, they’re going to keep doing it.” Meanwhile, bitcoin last week surged to a record high above $123,000 as Republicans in Congress pressed forward with landmark legislation to regulate cryptocurrencies. Economists at the consultancy Capital Economics said in a note that they think the “US economy will weather the global trade war,” enabling the S&P 500 to rise further. However, they said, Trump’s “unpredictable approach” to trade and attacks on the Fed’s independence could “trigger” a downturn in stocks. “The widespread assumption among market participants still appears to be that the president will not follow through on threats to raise tariffs much further and that Chair Powell will remain in place, but that may prove too optimistic,” they said. The S&P 500 has not posted a gain or loss of more than 1% since June 24. It’s a sign that momentum has slowed down. Bitcoin traded around $119,000 as of Tuesday. Megan Horneman, chief investment officer at Verdence Capital Advisors, said she thinks markets might be complacent about potential risks, given stocks are historically expensive. While stocks and bonds have emerged relatively unscathed, one outlier is the US dollar, which has continued a precipitous decline. The US dollar index, which measures the dollar’s strength against six major foreign currencies, is down almost 11% since Trump took office. Gold and silver, meanwhile, have continued to serve as hedges against Trump’s trade uncertainty. The yellow and silver precious metals have soared 30% and 35% this year, respectively. The rally in recent months has been driven by retail investors, or individuals buying their own stocks, as opposed to Wall Street institutions, according to Venu Krishna, an equity strategist at Barclays. “Re-risking by institutional money remains muted, making it likely that retail investors were at the helm for the latest leg of the rally,” Krishna said. He estimates retail investors poured more than $50 billion into global stocks across the past month. Investors who bought the dip when markets dropped in April have been rewarded with an extraordinary march to fresh highs. The S&P 500 has gained almost 27% since its low point in April. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has soared almost 37%. Related article Wall Street is calling Trump’s bluff The smaller Nasdaq 100 has gone 62 days without crossing below its 20-day moving average, which is the second longest streak on record after a 77-day streak in 1999, according to Jonathan Krinsky, chief markets technician at investment firm BTIG. And Wall Street money that has been on the sidelines has been creeping back into the market. A survey of global fund managers in July by Bank of America showed the biggest surge in “risk appetite” on record. The survey also showed the most bullish sentiment since February. Ethan Harris, a market watcher and former economist at Bank of America, said in a post on LinkedIn that Trump’s tariff announcements could be characterized as “Trump always tries again,” as opposed to “Trump always chickens out.” “His aggressive announcements are a way to test what he can ‘get away with,’” Harris said. “Hence the steady flow of new threats, partial retreats and then more threats.” As stocks hold near record highs as Trump’s trade deadline approaches, it remains to be seen whether markets will push back on the president’s plan to disrupt international trade. “The bond vigilantes may or may not have started to make a comeback this year,” Harris said. “Will the stock market become the trade war vigilante or remain complacent?” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Title: Strategic Plan for the United States to Accumulate 4 Million Bitcoin

Time Published: 2025-07-23T06:25:26Z

Executive Summary The United States is embarking on a bold, 15-year strategic initiative to accumulate 4 million Bitcoin (BTC) as a national asset. This visionary plan spans short-term (1–3 years) foundational actions, mid-term (4–7 years) expansion, and long-term (8–15 years) consolidation. It mobilizes all sectors – federal and state governments, private corporations, financial institutions, the tech industry, and individual citizens – in a coordinated effort. The strategy is funded through innovative, budget-neutral mechanisms (leveraging existing reserves, redirected budgets, public-private investment, and blockchain-related revenues) and emphasizes ethical, legal acquisition methods (mining, market investment, ETFs, voluntary pooling, and international partnerships). Strategic objectives include enhancing economic resilience, diversifying national reserves, cementing blockchain technology leadership, and strengthening national security. This plan anticipates and addresses challenges such as market impact, global competition, regulatory frameworks, and environmental sustainability. The following report details a roadmap for this initiative, with clear milestones, roles for each stakeholder, and an inspirational vision of American leadership in the digital asset era. Introduction: A New Frontier in National Economic Strategy Bitcoin, often dubbed “digital gold,” has matured from a niche experiment into a credible strategic asset on the global stage . With its permanently capped supply of 21 million BTC, Bitcoin’s scarcity and security present a unique opportunity for nations that move early to incorporate it into their reserves . Just as the U.S. historically accumulated gold and foreign currency reserves, the time has come to thoughtfully manage national ownership of digital assets for prosperity . Other countries and forward-looking leaders have begun to recognize Bitcoin’s potential. The United States itself holds a significant amount of Bitcoin from forfeitures, but until recently had no comprehensive strategy to leverage these holdings . A turning point came with high-level proposals and actions in 2024–2025, including calls for a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and legislation to acquire substantial BTC for the Treasury . These moves signaled that Bitcoin is entering the halls of U.S. fiscal policy as a long-term store of value and hedge against inflation . Why 4 million Bitcoin? This ambitious target – roughly 20% of Bitcoin’s eventual supply – would position America as the world’s largest Bitcoin holder, securing a dominant stake in the digital asset that could shape the future of finance. Holding such a reserve over decades is envisioned to strengthen the dollar’s resilience, hedge against economic volatility, and even help address the national debt by capitalizing on Bitcoin’s historical growth trajectory . While bold, this goal is in line with America’s tradition of thinking big and leading in new frontiers, from the space race to the internet revolution. Core Values and Principles: This strategy aligns with U.S. values of innovation, free enterprise, and individual liberty. It relies on voluntary, market-driven participation rather than coercion – there will be no forced appropriation of private Bitcoin holdings. Instead, the government will incentivize and inspire collective action. Transparency, rule of law, and respect for property rights will be upheld at every step. By embracing Bitcoin within a legal and ethical framework, the U.S. will demonstrate how democratic societies can innovate responsibly in the blockchain era. The following sections lay out the strategic objectives guiding this plan, the stakeholders involved and their roles, a phased roadmap across short, mid, and long-term horizons, funding sources and mechanisms, and considerations to mitigate risks. This comprehensive approach ensures that by 15 years from now, the United States will have not only accumulated 4 million BTC, but also solidified its position as the global leader in the digital asset economy – fostering prosperity, security, and technological leadership for generations to come. Strategic Objectives 1. Economic Resilience and Inflation Hedge Build a more resilient economy by holding Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and macroeconomic uncertainty. Bitcoin’s provable scarcity makes it akin to a digital commodity that cannot be inflated at will . By allocating a portion of national reserves to BTC, the U.S. can protect wealth against currency debasement and reduce reliance on any single foreign creditor or currency. Over time, Bitcoin’s long-term appreciation (historically averaging ~55% annually ) offers the potential to strengthen the national balance sheet and even help pay down public debt as its value grows . This financial buffer would enhance stability during economic downturns or crises, providing a store of value that is uncorrelated to traditional markets and immune to foreign political influence . 2. Digital Reserve Diversification Complement traditional reserves (such as gold and foreign currencies) with digital reserves. Establishing a Bitcoin reserve diversifies the nation’s holdings into a 21st-century asset class . Just as gold bolsters confidence in a country’s financial footing, Bitcoin – with its decentralized, transparent network – can serve as a trust anchor in an increasingly digital global economy. A U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve would be a portfolio diversifier and innovation signal , reducing dependence on dollar-centric systems while positioning the nation for a future where digital assets play a key role in global finance . This diversification is pragmatic: it hedges against potential weakness in other reserves and embraces the evolving monetary landscape. 3. Technological Leadership and Innovation Assert American leadership in blockchain technology and the emerging digital economy. A national effort to accumulate Bitcoin goes hand-in-hand with promoting innovation in the underlying technologies – from cybersecurity and cryptography to financial technology. By actively engaging with Bitcoin, the U.S. signals that it is the best place to develop and deploy blockchain innovations, attracting talent and investment. Strategic Bitcoin accumulation is a “statement of alignment with a digitally native economic future,” providing a blueprint that encourages private sector adoption and innovation . This objective includes fostering a robust domestic cryptocurrency industry, supporting research in energy-efficient mining and scalability, and setting global standards for blockchain use. Ultimately, it’s about ensuring the next generation of tech companies and protocols are made in America, securing our role as the global hub of blockchain development. 4. National Security and Geopolitical Influence Enhance national security by preventing strategic adversaries from dominating the crypto realm and by leveraging Bitcoin as a geopolitical asset. In the 21st century, economic security is national security. If Bitcoin and other digital assets become integral to the world financial system, the U.S. must not fall behind. A substantial BTC reserve gives America greater influence over the future of decentralized finance, much as our gold reserves bolstered our clout in the 20th century. It also acts as a neutral reserve asset that could reinforce alliances (for example, through coordinated accumulation or exchange agreements with allies) and provide options in sanction regimes or international aid (using BTC for humanitarian payments where traditional systems fail). By leading in Bitcoin ownership, the U.S. can help set global norms (for transparency, anti-money-laundering, cyber defense) and ensure that open societies, not authoritarian regimes, shape the rules of digital finance. As Senator Cynthia Lummis noted, Bitcoin’s strategic importance for the country is such that some call it “manifest destiny for the United States” – a new frontier to secure for the nation’s freedom and prosperity. These objectives are interlocking and mutually reinforcing. Economic strength supports security; technological leadership fuels economic growth; reserve diversification aids resilience; and all enhance America’s standing in the world. With the “why” established, we now turn to the “how” – the stakeholders and strategies that will deliver on these objectives. Key Stakeholders and Their Roles Achieving a goal as ambitious as accumulating 4 million BTC requires a “whole-of-America” approach, engaging public and private sectors as well as individual citizens. Each stakeholder group has unique strengths to contribute: All these actors will coordinate under a shared vision. A National Digital Assets Task Force can be established to ensure communication and synergy between federal agencies, state governments, industry leaders, and community representatives. Regular summits and progress reports will keep everyone aligned. The message is clear: every American can be part of this endeavor, and everyone stands to benefit from the innovation, wealth creation, and security enhancements it will bring. Strategic Roadmap by Timeframe The journey to 4 million Bitcoin is mapped out in three phases – short-term, mid-term, and long-term – each with specific initiatives and milestones. This phased approach ensures steady progress while allowing assessment and course-correction at each stage. Importantly, actions are designed to minimize market disruption (accumulating gradually and via multiple avenues) and remain flexible to technological and economic developments. Short-Term (1–3 Years): Laying the Foundation Goals (1–3 years): Establish the legal, institutional, and infrastructural groundwork for large-scale Bitcoin accumulation. Kickstart the reserve with existing assets, enact supportive policies, and galvanize private sector involvement – all while raising public awareness. Early moves are budget-neutral or low-cost, relying on reallocated resources and voluntary participation to avoid burdening taxpayers. Milestones for Phase 1: With the foundation laid and early momentum achieved, the stage is set to accelerate into the mid-term phase. Mid-Term (4–7 Years): Scaling Up and Integration Goals (4–7 years): Rapidly scale the accumulation efforts while integrating Bitcoin more deeply into U.S. economic structures. In this phase, the aim is to go from hundreds of thousands of BTC to millions of BTC under American ownership. The federal government, having proven the concept and established trust in phase 1, can expand its holdings more aggressively (market conditions permitting), and the private sector’s involvement becomes self-sustaining. This phase will likely coincide with greater global attention – both cooperation and competition – which the U.S. must navigate wisely. Milestones for Phase 2: At the end of the mid-term phase, the U.S. should be well on its way to the 4 million BTC goal, possibly around halfway there, and the foundations of a crypto-powered economy fully laid. The final phase will focus on securing the gains and leveraging them for enduring advantage. Long-Term (8–15 Years): Leadership, Preservation, and Prosperity Goals (8–15 years): By this phase, the United States envisions reaching the 4 million BTC target and solidifying the permanence of Bitcoin in its national asset mix. The focus shifts from aggressive accumulation to sustainable management and utilization of the reserve as needed for the national interest (without ever undermining Bitcoin’s ecosystem). America’s leadership in the blockchain space should be unquestioned by year 15, and the strategic Bitcoin reserve serves as a foundation for economic strength, much like gold did in previous eras. This period also involves adapting to any new developments (technological, geopolitical) that could affect our Bitcoin strategy. Milestones for Phase 3: Funding Sources and Mechanisms A variety of funding sources and mechanisms are employed across these phases to finance Bitcoin accumulation in a sustainable, ethical manner. Below is a summary of key funding approaches, emphasizing creativity and public-private collaboration: All these funding sources share a common theme: they are ethical, transparent, and largely voluntary/market-driven. The plan pointedly avoids any coercive measures like forced confiscation or heavy new taxation that would contradict the values of a free economy. By tapping into existing value, future growth, and willing participation, the U.S. can accumulate Bitcoin in a way that strengthens rather than burdens the nation. It’s worth noting that as Bitcoin’s price potentially grows, the dollar cost of reaching 4 million BTC will increase. Thus, early funding (short-term) gets more “bang for buck” in BTC terms, while later on the focus might shift to maximizing value of holdings rather than chasing a numeric BTC total at any cost. Flexibility in funding strategy will be maintained – if Bitcoin’s market is overheated, the U.S. can pause buys and rely more on mining or wait for corrections, for example. Ethical, Legal, and Security Considerations A plan of this magnitude raises important ethical and legal considerations, which are addressed proactively to ensure the initiative upholds American values and the rule of law: In summary, the ethical and legal framework surrounding this strategy is robust: voluntary, transparent, lawful, and responsible. The plan is designed to amplify the best of American capitalism and democracy – using open markets and free choice to achieve a national goal – while putting checks in place to curb excesses or missteps. This strategic journey will be one carried out in the public eye, inviting input and scrutiny, which will only strengthen its execution. Conclusion: A Future-Focused Vision for American Prosperity Fifteen years from now, Americans will look back on this initiative as a pivotal chapter in our nation’s economic story – the moment we seized the opportunity of a digital frontier and made it our own. By accumulating 4 million bitcoins, the United States positions itself not only to benefit from the growth of a revolutionary asset but also to steer that revolution in accordance with our values of freedom, transparency, and innovation. This comprehensive plan harnesses the collective power of federal resolve, state creativity, private sector dynamism, and individual enthusiasm. It is inspirational and optimistic by design: it says that America’s best days are not behind us, but ahead on a new horizon of blockchain technology and digital finance. Just as past generations rallied to ambitious national endeavors – building the transcontinental railroad, landing on the moon, inventing the internet – we too rally to make the U.S. the guiding light in the crypto era. By pursuing this strategy, the U.S. will enjoy a more resilient and diversified economy, new waves of tech entrepreneurship, and a strengthened geopolitical hand. We will have shown that embracing change, rather than fearing it, is the surest path to long-term prosperity and security. The strategic Bitcoin reserve, once a novel idea, will become a cornerstone of national strength – a digital complement to Fort Knox, symbolizing American ingenuity in the 21st century. There will undoubtedly be challenges along the way: market fluctuations, technical hurdles, perhaps political debates. But as laid out, we have plans to navigate these – cautiously, transparently, and boldly when needed. The involvement of all stakeholders means this vision does not belong to one party or administration, but to all Americans. It can and should unite us in common purpose, much like great infrastructure or exploration projects of the past. In conclusion, this strategic plan is more than an economic play – it’s a statement to the world that America remains the land of forward-looking visionaries, unafraid to invest in the future. It invites every citizen, entrepreneur, and public servant to be a part of forging a new legacy. Together, we are not just accumulating coins; we are building a foundation of economic freedom, technological leadership, and national renewal that will support the American Dream for generations to come. Let us proceed with confidence, creativity, and unity on this path. The digital frontier is ours to lead – and in doing so, we will secure the blessings of prosperity and security for ourselves and our posterity, in the true spirit of the United States of America.

Key points: Bitcoinâs path to $200,000 hinges on sustained buying volume, which analysts say is still lacking. Trumpâs presidency has already accelerated Bitcoinâs adoption through policies favoring crypto and fiscal expansion. Institutional demand via ETFs and geopolitical uncertainty are driving Bitcoinâs appeal as a "digital gold" alternative. Historical patterns suggest Bitcoinâs current cycle may have limited months of growth left before stabilization. The $200,000 question: Patience or pipe dream? James Checkâs analysis cuts through the hype. While Bitcoin breached 120,000 in July 2024, he insists the journey to 200,000 requires "stages of stability," not just spikes. "Trading through air" without solid support risks a nosedive, he cautionsâa reminder of cryptoâs volatile soul. Yet his long-term faith is unshaken: five years out, he envisions Bitcoin "well and truly" surpassing $200,000, a belief mirrored by firms like Bernstein Research and Bitwise. The paradox? Retail euphoria clashes with institutional pragmatism. Spot Bitcoin ETFs, approved in early 2024, have funneled billions into the market, but Check waits for "volume kick-in" before betting big. "No one knows" Bitcoinâs exact path, he admitsâa humble mantra in an industry obsessed with crystal balls. Trumpâs wildcard: Crypto politics meets fiscal fireworks Enter Donald Trump and the economic wins since then. A November 2024 victory rewrote Bitcoinâs playbook. JPMorgan notes Trumpâs pro-crypto stanceâpledging to dethrone SEC chair Gary Gensler and embrace "debt debasement" via tariffs and fiscal spendingâmight turbocharge the "debasement trade." Imagine small Bitcoin handouts to citizens or a White House push for a $1 trillion market cap. Such moves could divert attention from gold, reshaping portfolios worldwide. But Trumpâs policies are a double-edged sword. Expansionary fiscal measures might fuel inflation, making scarce assets like Bitcoin more appealing. Yet regulatory clarity could lure institutional players, stabilizing Bitcoinâs notoriously mercurial markets. Reaching a $200,000 Bitcoin Reaching a $200,000 per Bitcoin price would require a combination of technical, macroeconomic, and psychological factors driving demand higher than supply. Based on Kendrick's projections and historical Bitcoin market cycles, hereâs what would likely need to happen: 1. Sustained Bull Market Momentum Bitcoin is in the "euphoria phase" of a bull run, where FOMO (fear of missing out) drives rapid price appreciation. A continuation of this trend for 12â24 months could propel BTC toward $200K, especially if institutional and retail demand remains strong. 2. Supply Shock & Halving Dynamics The 2024 Bitcoin halving reduced the new supply of BTC by 50%. Historically, halvings trigger major bull runs ~12â18 months later due to reduced selling pressure from miners. If demand remains constant or increases while new supply shrinks, scarcity could push prices toward $200K or higher. 3. Institutional Adoption & ETF Approvals Spot Bitcoin ETF approvals (e.g., BlackRock, Fidelity) would funnel trillions in institutional capital into BTC. Major corporations adding BTC to balance sheets (MicroStrategy-style moves) would further squeeze supply. 4. Macroeconomic Tailwinds A weaker U.S. dollar (due to rate cuts, inflation, or debt crises) would make Bitcoin more attractive as hard money. Geopolitical instability (e.g., currency collapses, wars) could drive "safe-haven" demand. 5. Network & Ecosystem Growth Layer-2 adoption (Lightning Network, Ordinals) increases BTCâs utility, attracting more users. Regulatory clarity (e.g., pro-crypto laws) reduces uncertainty, encouraging capital inflows. History whispers: Cycles, shocks, and the retail reckoning Bitcoinâs past cycles offer cryptic clues. Rekt Capital flags 2020âs patternsâif repeated, Bitcoinâs 2024 bull run might exhaust itself by mid-2025. Meanwhile, supply shocks loom. Bitwiseâs Matt Hougan points to institutional demand outstripping new Bitcoin minted post-halving, a recipe for price explosions. Retail investors, burned by 2022âs crash, are tiptoeing back. September 2024 saw ETF inflows revive after Augustâs slump, signaling renewed faith. But as CME futures open interest quadruples in 2024, the question lingers: Is this institutional confidence or speculative froth? Beyond charts and elections, Bitcoinâs saga taps into a deeper hungerâfor financial autonomy amid distrust of centralized systems. The original vision of decentralization battles against Wall Streetâs embrace, a tension Check acknowledges. "The market needs stabilized," he says, voicing a quiet plea for maturity in an adolescent asset class. Whether 2025 becomes Bitcoinâs coronation or another chapter in its volatile epic, one truth endures: in a world of shaky currencies and political turmoil, people crave alternatives. Bitcoin, while it may be more risky than ever, it continues to provide unyielding gains. Will it continue to be the lifeline to combat inflation in the coming years?

September 2024 saw ETF inflows revive after Augustâs slump, signaling renewed faith. But as CME futures open interest quadruples in 2024, the question lingers: Is this institutional confidence or speculative froth? Beyond charts and elections, Bitcoinâs saga taps into a deeper hungerâfor financial autonomy amid distrust of centralized systems. The original vision of decentralization battles against Wall Streetâs embrace, a tension Check acknowledges. "The market needs stabilized," he says, voicing a quiet plea for maturity in an adolescent asset class. Whether 2025 becomes Bitcoinâs coronation or another chapter in its volatile epic, one truth endures: in a world of shaky currencies and political turmoil, people crave alternatives. Bitcoin, while it may be more risky than ever, it continues to provide unyielding gains. Will it continue to be the lifeline to combat inflation in the coming years? Sources include: CoinTelegraph.com CoinTelegraph.com CoinTelegraph.com Bitcoinâs path to $200,000 hinges on sustained buying volume, which analysts say is still lacking. Trumpâs presidency has already accelerated Bitcoinâs adoption through policies favoring crypto and fiscal expansion. Institutional demand via ETFs and geopolitical uncertainty are driving Bitcoinâs appeal as a "digital gold" alternative. Historical patterns suggest Bitcoinâs current cycle may have limited months of growth left before stabilization. The $200,000 question: Patience or pipe dream? James Checkâs analysis cuts through the hype. While Bitcoin breached 120,000 in July 2024, he insists the journey to 200,000 requires "stages of stability," not just spikes. "Trading through air" without solid support risks a nosedive, he cautionsâa reminder of cryptoâs volatile soul. Yet his long-term faith is unshaken: five years out, he envisions Bitcoin "well and truly" surpassing $200,000, a belief mirrored by firms like Bernstein Research and Bitwise. The paradox? Retail euphoria clashes with institutional pragmatism. Spot Bitcoin ETFs, approved in early 2024, have funneled billions into the market, but Check waits for "volume kick-in" before betting big. "No one knows" Bitcoinâs exact path, he admitsâa humble mantra in an industry obsessed with crystal balls. Trumpâs wildcard: Crypto politics meets fiscal fireworks Enter Donald Trump and the economic wins since then. A November 2024 victory rewrote Bitcoinâs playbook. JPMorgan notes Trumpâs pro-crypto stanceâpledging to dethrone SEC chair Gary Gensler and embrace "debt debasement" via tariffs and fiscal spendingâmight turbocharge the "debasement trade." Imagine small Bitcoin handouts to citizens or a White House push for a $1 trillion market cap. Such moves could divert attention from gold, reshaping portfolios worldwide. But Trumpâs policies are a double-edged sword. Expansionary fiscal measures might fuel inflation, making scarce assets like Bitcoin more appealing. Yet regulatory clarity could lure institutional players, stabilizing Bitcoinâs notoriously mercurial markets. Reaching a $200,000 Bitcoin Reaching a $200,000 per Bitcoin price would require a combination of technical, macroeconomic, and psychological factors driving demand higher than supply. Based on Kendrick's projections and historical Bitcoin market cycles, hereâs what would likely need to happen: 1. Sustained Bull Market Momentum Bitcoin is in the "euphoria phase" of a bull run, where FOMO (fear of missing out) drives rapid price appreciation. A continuation of this trend for 12â24 months could propel BTC toward $200K, especially if institutional and retail demand remains strong. 2. Supply Shock & Halving Dynamics The 2024 Bitcoin halving reduced the new supply of BTC by 50%. Historically, halvings trigger major bull runs ~12â18 months later due to reduced selling pressure from miners. If demand remains constant or increases while new supply shrinks, scarcity could push prices toward $200K or higher. 3. Institutional Adoption & ETF Approvals Spot Bitcoin ETF approvals (e.g., BlackRock, Fidelity) would funnel trillions in institutional capital into BTC. Major corporations adding BTC to balance sheets (MicroStrategy-style moves) would further squeeze supply. 4. Macroeconomic Tailwinds A weaker U.S. dollar (due to rate cuts, inflation, or debt crises) would make Bitcoin more attractive as hard money. Geopolitical instability (e.g., currency collapses, wars) could drive "safe-haven" demand. 5. Network & Ecosystem Growth Layer-2 adoption (Lightning Network, Ordinals) increases BTCâs utility, attracting more users. Regulatory clarity (e.g., pro-crypto laws) reduces uncertainty, encouraging capital inflows. History whispers: Cycles, shocks, and the retail reckoning Bitcoinâs past cycles offer cryptic clues.

A continuation of this trend for 12â24 months could propel BTC toward $200K, especially if institutional and retail demand remains strong. 2. Supply Shock & Halving Dynamics The 2024 Bitcoin halving reduced the new supply of BTC by 50%. Historically, halvings trigger major bull runs ~12â18 months later due to reduced selling pressure from miners. If demand remains constant or increases while new supply shrinks, scarcity could push prices toward $200K or higher. 3. Institutional Adoption & ETF Approvals Spot Bitcoin ETF approvals (e.g., BlackRock, Fidelity) would funnel trillions in institutional capital into BTC. Major corporations adding BTC to balance sheets (MicroStrategy-style moves) would further squeeze supply. 4. Macroeconomic Tailwinds A weaker U.S. dollar (due to rate cuts, inflation, or debt crises) would make Bitcoin more attractive as hard money. Geopolitical instability (e.g., currency collapses, wars) could drive "safe-haven" demand. 5. Network & Ecosystem Growth Layer-2 adoption (Lightning Network, Ordinals) increases BTCâs utility, attracting more users. Regulatory clarity (e.g., pro-crypto laws) reduces uncertainty, encouraging capital inflows. History whispers: Cycles, shocks, and the retail reckoning Bitcoinâs past cycles offer cryptic clues. Rekt Capital flags 2020âs patternsâif repeated, Bitcoinâs 2024 bull run might exhaust itself by mid-2025. Meanwhile, supply shocks loom. Bitwiseâs Matt Hougan points to institutional demand outstripping new Bitcoin minted post-halving, a recipe for price explosions. Retail investors, burned by 2022âs crash, are tiptoeing back.

"The market needs stabilized," he says, voicing a quiet plea for maturity in an adolescent asset class. Whether 2025 becomes Bitcoinâs coronation or another chapter in its volatile epic, one truth endures: in a world of shaky currencies and political turmoil, people crave alternatives. Bitcoin, while it may be more risky than ever, it continues to provide unyielding gains. Will it continue to be the lifeline to combat inflation in the coming years?

Expansionary fiscal measures might fuel inflation, making scarce assets like Bitcoin more appealing. Yet regulatory clarity could lure institutional players, stabilizing Bitcoinâs notoriously mercurial markets. Reaching a $200,000 Bitcoin Reaching a $200,000 per Bitcoin price would require a combination of technical, macroeconomic, and psychological factors driving demand higher than supply.
