Title: 21Shares launches crypto index ETFs under SEC’s Act 40

Time Published: 2025-11-13T18:42:33Z
Full Content:
21Shares’ new crypto index ETFs utilize the stricter 1940 Act framework, marking a shift toward traditional fund oversight for diversified digital asset exposure. Asset manager 21Shares has launched two cryptocurrency index exchange-traded funds (ETFs) regulated under the Investment Company Act of 1940, a structure that could boost investor confidence by subjecting the products to the same disclosure and governance rules that apply to traditional US investment funds. The new products — the 21Shares FTSE Crypto 10 Index ETF (TTOP) and the 21Shares FTSE Crypto 10 ex-BTC Index ETF (TXBC) — were announced on Thursday. Both offer broad exposure to digital assets by tracking FTSE Russell cryptocurrency indexes and holding a basket of the top crypto assets by market capitalization, rather than investing in a single token. Federico Brokate, 21Shares’ global head of business development, said that index funds have enabled investors to gain diversified exposure to traditional assets, particularly stocks. “The same principle applies to crypto investing,” he said. 21Shares has been highly active in the crypto exchange-traded product market and was recently acquired by FalconX for an undisclosed amount. The company will continue to operate independently under the FalconX umbrella. Related: SEC says proof-of-work mining does not constitute securities dealing The Investment Company Act of 1940 is the regulatory framework that governs US mutual funds and most conventional ETFs, imposing requirements around custody and investor protections. This contrasts with the Securities Act of 1933, which is used for grantor trust structures that hold physical commodities — the model regulators have mainly applied to US spot crypto products to date. As Cointelegraph reported, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has already approved a crypto ETP under the ’33 Act — the Rex-Osprey Doge ETF, which launched in September. Until now, the SEC has mainly approved spot Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) products under the ’33 Act, rather than as fully regulated, investment-company ETFs under the ’40 Act. Demand for crypto ETFs has been high since spot Bitcoin funds debuted in early 2024. BlackRock has led the pack: Its IBIT Bitcoin ETF amassed roughly $70 billion in assets under management within its first year and a half on the market.

Title: XRP Price Jumps as First U.S. Spot ETF Debuts on Nasdaq, Analysts Predict Rally in Weeks

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. The XRP market just hit a historic milestone as the first U.S. spot XRP ETF, Canary Capital’s XRPC, officially debuts on Nasdaq, sending bullish shockwaves for the XRP price and other assets in the market. The launch gives traditional investors direct exposure to XRP through regulated brokerage accounts, and analysts say this could be the spark that propels prices sharply higher in the coming weeks. Nasdaq has certified the Canary Capital XRP ETF for trading under the ticker XRPC, making it the first fully spot-based XRP ETF in the U.S. The fund holds XRP directly and tracks the XRP-USD CCIXber Reference Rate Index, offering a simple, regulated way for institutions and retail investors to gain exposure without managing wallets or private keys. The ETF’s approval comes after the fund completed its Form 8-A filing with the SEC, clearing key regulatory hurdles. Other heavyweights, Franklin Templeton, Bitwise, CoinShares, and 21Shares, also have XRP ETF applications in the pipeline, signaling a second wave of products that could further deepen liquidity and demand. On-chain data already shows shifting behavior ahead of the launch. Exchange inflows are down, suggesting holders are accumulating rather than selling, even as XRP trades around the $2.39–$2.50 zone and consolidates above support near $2.20–$2.40. Popular crypto analyst Egrag Crypto believes XRP is entering the final stages of a major consolidation that could lead to an explosive move within 4–6 weeks. Drawing on historical rallies in 2017 and 2021, he notes that XRP is once again forming a large symmetrical triangle, typically a “compression before expansion” structure. Using Fibonacci projections, Egrag highlights potential long-term targets between $10 and $37, while acknowledging that short-term market sentiment remains cautious. He argues that impatience and emotional selling often precede the biggest upside moves, and that today’s sideways action is more “preparation” than weakness. Institutional narratives are also lining up behind XRP. At Swell 2025, BlackRock’s Maxwell Stein described the XRP Ledger as a scalable rail for trillions of dollars in tokenized assets and cross-border payments, reinforcing XRP’s status as a utility-driven asset rather than a purely speculative token. With the Fed’s December rate decision approaching and risk appetite poised to shift, XRP now sits at the intersection of a powerful trio. Fresh ETF inflows, tightening technical patterns, and growing institutional validation. If these forces align, the XRPC launch may be remembered as the moment XRP’s next major rally truly began.

Title: The most important crypto moments of the year
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-most-important-crypto-moments-of-the-year
Time Published: 2025-11-13T17:54:58Z
Full Content:
The most influential crypto events of 2025 included sweeping regulatory moves, ecosystem expansion and the rise of new onchain trends. Bitcoin’s rise past $100,000 in 2025 marked a shift from speculative trading to long-term institutional adoption. Banks and governments began viewing BTC as a strategic reserve asset. The GENIUS Act established a unified US framework for payment stablecoins, mandating 1:1 reserve backing, stricter issuer qualifications and stronger consumer protections. Real-world asset tokenization surpassed $30 billion onchain, driven by tokenized US Treasurys and private credit. Firms such as BlackRock, JPMorgan and Apollo integrated RWAs into DeFi markets. Onchain perpetual futures recorded over $1 trillion in monthly trading volume, with platforms like Hyperliquid achieving speed and depth comparable to centralized exchanges. Bitcoin (BTC) crossing the $100,000 threshold this year carried more symbolic weight than speculative excitement. What was once seen as a speculative asset became a structured part of the global financial system. 2025 has turned out to be a year focused less on hype and more on meaningful progress in infrastructure, regulation, institutional investment and technology. This article highlights the most significant cryptocurrency events of the year. Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) brought Bitcoin into the portfolios of asset managers, pension funds and corporate treasuries, pushing it beyond retail markets. Daily ETF inflows became a key indicator of market confidence. Unlike previous cycles driven by high-leverage trading, 2025 saw steady interest from professional investors. Banks began conducting Bitcoin transactions on their own balance sheets. Intesa Sanpaolo, Italy’s largest bank, made its first proprietary Bitcoin trade in January 2025, purchasing 1 million euros worth of BTC as an experiment. Several countries are also exploring the idea of strategic Bitcoin reserves, referring to long-term national holdings of the asset. On March 6, 2025, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve, a permanent asset fund supported by forfeited BTC. The Czech National Bank has also announced that it is considering adding Bitcoin to its strategic reserves. Did you know? Bitcoin mining firms partner with energy producers to stabilize electrical grids and monetize surplus power. In 2025, stablecoins matured from trading instruments into regulated payment and settlement assets. The GENIUS Act, signed into law on July 18, 2025, established the first comprehensive US federal framework for payment stablecoins. The law clarifies that qualifying payment stablecoins are not securities, creates a unified federal licensing and oversight regime for issuers and requires full 1:1 reserve backing with high-quality, highly liquid assets such as cash and short-term US Treasurys. It also mandates regular public disclosures of reserve composition to ensure transparency and consumer protection. Only approved and qualified entities, such as subsidiaries of insured depository institutions, can now issue stablecoins. These issuers must meet strict standards for capital, liquidity and risk management. The act also includes provisions to protect stablecoin holders in the event of issuer insolvency. While the GENIUS Act drew inspiration from earlier proposals, it strengthened safeguards for financial stability. It addressed concerns about a fragmented monetary system by establishing a clearer and more coordinated regulatory framework for digital dollar payments. In 2025, real-world asset (RWA) tokenization transitioned from experimental pilots to institutional mainstream, with onchain value surpassing $30 billion, representing a 300%-400% increase over three years. US Treasurys and private credit are driving institutional adoption. Launched in March 2024, the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) brings US Treasurys onchain through tokenization. BUIDL now holds more than $2 billion in total value locked (TVL) across multiple blockchains and distributes daily interest, backed 1:1 by real-world assets. The benefits of RWA tokenization include fractional ownership, 24/7 liquidity and cross-chain interoperability through protocols such as Chainlink CCIP. Institutions like JPMorgan and Apollo are integrating RWAs into decentralized finance (DeFi), further blurring the boundaries between traditional finance and blockchain. Did you know? Tokenized US Treasurys became one of the fastest-growing categories in DeFi, offering low-risk, onchain yields. In October 2025, DeFi perpetual futures surpassed $1 trillion in monthly trading volume, putting platforms like Hyperliquid on par with centralized crypto exchanges. The daily trading volume for decentralized perpetual contracts averaged around $45.7 billion that month, while onchain open interest rose to $16 billion. This increase reflects sustained market positioning rather than short-lived speculative activity. Hyperliquid’s HIP-3 upgrade in October enabled permissionless market creation through the staking of 500,000 HYPE tokens. The update decentralized listings and encouraged innovation in new asset classes such as equities and RWAs. The platform’s sub-second execution and deep liquidity have further narrowed the gap between centralized and decentralized exchanges. This year, Ethereum reinforced its foundational role in the blockchain ecosystem through strategic upgrades and growing institutional adoption. The Pectra upgrade, activated in May, doubled blob capacity, reduced layer-2 fees and improved transaction throughput. It also raised the validator staking cap from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH, enhancing validator efficiency. In July 2025, spot Ether ETFs attracted $12.1 billion in inflows, led by BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), highlighting strong institutional demand. Regulatory clarity from US Securities and Exchange Commission rulings positioned Ethereum as compliant infrastructure for DeFi and RWAs, reinforcing its role as Web3’s resilient settlement layer. The upcoming Fusaka upgrade in December is expected to deliver further PeerDAS optimizations, strengthening Ethereum’s long-term position. Did you know? Corporations are increasingly using private or hybrid Ethereum chains for supply-chain tracking and settlement workflows. Solana’s narrative took a sharply positive turn in 2025. Once criticized for network outages and instability, the network made major strides in reliability and performance. The introduction of Firedancer, a new validator client, enhanced redundancy and processing capacity, reflecting Solana’s focus on large-scale, dependable operations. Institutional and derivatives markets also embraced Solana in 2025. Leading regulated platforms introduced Solana-based futures and options, enabling hedging and arbitrage opportunities that were previously limited to Bitcoin and Ether (ETH). This development reinforced Solana’s growing importance in high-volume applications such as onchain trading, gaming and consumer services. The industry faced another reminder in 2025 that security remains a major challenge. With more than $2.17 billion stolen from cryptocurrency services as of Nov. 11, 2025, this year has already proven more devastating than the entirety of 2024 in terms of total losses. A large portion of the stolen funds came from North Korea’s $1.5-billion hack of Bybit. As cryptocurrency becomes more integrated into global finance, security failures now pose systemic risks rather than isolated incidents. The growing sophistication of attackers has mirrored the industry’s own technological progress. In 2025, AI-driven attacks and complex supply chain vulnerabilities led to widespread efforts across the industry to strengthen cybersecurity practices.

Title: Return 'home' to Dublin allowing Schmidt ease pressure
URL: https://www.rte.ie/sport/rugby/2025/1113/1543838-return-home-to-dublin-allowing-schmidt-ease-pressure/
Time Published: 2025-11-13T17:04:42Z
Full Content:
Neil Treacy RTÉ Sport Journalist For the second November in a row Joe Schmidt has come back to Dublin with his Australian side, and for the second year in a row he's been a man in demand. Having spent a combined nine years as head coach of Leinster and then Ireland, not to mention his earlier days as a player in Mullingar, the New Zealander has laid a few roots in this country. There’s been time this week to grab dinner with some of his family who are still in Ireland; his son, Tim, is living in Churchtown after returning from a few years in Melbourne, while his brother, Jamie, is based in Blackrock. The Wallabies had a day off on Wednesday, and while some of his players braved the elements for golf in Portmarnock, he grabbed a cup of coffee with his former Ireland team manager Mick Kearney, and he’ll squeeze in a catch-up with his former captain Rory Best tomorrow. Far from getting bogged down after a run of five defeats in six games, a few days in Dublin are releasing the pressure valve. "That's part of the balance," he says, ahead of Saturday’s meeting with Ireland at Aviva Stadium. "To go back to your question, how do you cope with pressure? Well, family is always a great kind of distraction and opportunity to just be able to step outside the bubble you're in, which can eat away at you a little bit and breathe for a few hours. "I remember coming back last year and seeing familiar faces, so I guess there's always comfort and familiarity with a lot of the people, as much as anything. "I got out of an Uber in town yesterday morning and I was with our manager Chris Thompson. The first three people walking past, 'Hey Joe, howya Joe?’ "It’s just a really nice feeling, like you're kind of home. So yeah, I'll miss that." Schmidt (above) recently turned 60-years-old, and will vacate his post as Wallabies head coach in July to hand the baton on to his former Ireland assistant Les Kiss. He doesn’t know what the future holds from a coaching perspective, stressing his reason to step away from the Australia job is to spend more time with his family, and in particular his youngest son Luke, who has had a severe form of epilepsy since he was a child. And so, it’s possible that Saturday’s game will be his final as a coach in Dublin, although he has plans to return to the Aviva in a different capacity some day in the future. "Maybe Terenure, but Carlos [Spencer] has got that job, and I’m so old I coached Carlos. No, I won’t be doing that," he laughs. "I've always thought – and I know this may sound bizarre - but I've always thought when we used to go into the [Aviva] stadium and you drive past the Sandymount Hotel, I’ll look at all those people having pints and really enjoying themselves, and I'm feeling like I'm in this sardine can of pressure. "I'll look out there and I think: ‘One day, I'm going to get amongst those people and then I'm going to drift into that stadium and I'm going to enjoy watching a game where I'm not so emotionally hanging off everything that happens'. "I have been looking forward to finishing for a long time and it was a phone call from a mate of mine that had me end up here [with Australia]. I've got to say I really enjoyed it." Of course, there was a time where he wasn't so popular in Dublin, as he recalled his inauspicious start to coaching Leinster in 2010. "I'll never forget my start in Leinster. You talk about losing in Italy [last week] and losing in Treviso in game four [in 2010]. "The experienced Irish boys had just come back in and apparently I had lost the dressing-room and the first question I was asked at the next press conference was, 'Joe, is this the beginning of the end of Leinster Rugby?' I thought that was a little melodramatic!" Even aside from Schmidt’s time coaching some of these Irish players, there will be a strong familiarity between he and the team. He was part of the All Blacks’ coaching team that knocked Ireland out of the World Cup in 2023, before bringing the Wallabies to Dublin this time last year, and running coming up just short, losing 22-19 to Andy Farrell’s side. Only a few months ago, his Wallabies hosted the British and Irish Lions in Australia, losing the series 2-1 Farrell's side which was heavily populated by Irish players and coaches. Since Farrell’s return to his Irish post, Ireland have struggled to click; beaten by New Zealand in Chicago before a clunky performance in their 41-10 win against Japan. But Schmidt isn't buying the suggestion that this Irish side are struggling. "I think there's some really good glimpses. Not too many teams play 20 minutes without a player, and they're ahead of the All Blacks even after 60 minutes, because those 20 minutes take it out of you. "We played a Test recently against the All Blacks and lost a player for 10 minutes and then another player for 10 minutes, and while you might not lose those two 10 minute blocks, you lose a bit of fuel in the tank because they're always going to stretch you at the back end of the game. "So I felt in that game, as a consequence, it made the back end certainly a bit tougher. "I look at some of the guys who've been selected for this game and were selected last week, and there's some very good boys coming through, like young Paddy McCarthy. "It’s disappointing for Joe [McCarthy] that he's not there, but not disappointing for us that he's not there."

Title: ‘Israel Did Not Kill Charlie Kirk. That Is Insane!’: The World According to Hasan Piker
URL: https://variety.com/2025/digital/features/hasan-piker-interview-charlie-kirk-israel-gal-gadot-1236574930/
Time Published: 2025-11-13T16:00:00Z
Full Content:
Photographs by Dan Doperalski Hasan Piker is about to prove his point. For weeks, the wildly popular Twitch streamer and leftist commentator has been following the online discourse surrounding the assassination of Charlie Kirk. The topic is personal for Piker, who was scheduled to debate Kirk at Dartmouth College 15 days after the right-wing political activist was gunned down on a Utah campus. Authorities charged college student Tyler Robinson with the crime, but lately, a civil war has erupted among conservatives over conspiratorial claims that the Mossad had a hand in the murder. “You would be surprised at how many people believe that stuff,” he says as he mulls the menu options at a crowded Chelsea restaurant on a brisk October morning. Related Stories 'Avatar: The Last Airbender'-Magic: The Gathering Collaboration Set Unveils Seven New Cards: Zuko, Iroh and More (EXCLUSIVE) When our waiter arrives, Piker turns to the 20-something hipster. “Can I ask you a question? Who is the most likely person that killed Charlie Kirk?” he asks. “I think it was Israel. It seems like an inside job,” the server replies hesitantly before heading back to the kitchen for Piker’s cold brew. Popular on Variety The answer comes as a shock to me. But it’s no surprise to the extremely online millennial who acknowledges that he is fascinated by conspiracy theories. “I watch every Candace Owens,” Piker says, referring to the new-media star of the far right who has fanned the flames of the Israel theory. He nods in the direction of our waiter: “It’s the reason why I know exactly where he is coming from with the Charlie-Israel thing. For me, no matter how far-fetched the conspiracy is, if it is getting 2 million views in 24 hours, that means a lot of people are tuning in to it. That means a lot of people are paying attention to it. And in this day and age, I think a lot of people are believing it.” Piker feels no allyship with Owens even if they share the belief that Israel is a malignant force. He is merely a student of the attention economy, a space in which he is thriving. With nearly 3 million followers on Twitch and 1.75 million YouTube subscribers, the 34-year-old influencer seems like a possible answer to the question of when the left will find its own Joe Rogan. As the next generation turns more conservative and alpha males like Andrew Tate ascend, Piker offers an alternative vision and the rare ability to sway an election. As an early and enthusiastic supporter of Zohran Mamdani, Piker played a key role in helping catapult the New York mayoral candidate to Gracie Mansion by spreading the Democrat’s socialist message to his legion of fans. With our waiter out of earshot, Piker drops his voice discreetly. “Israel did not kill Charlie Kirk. That is insane!” he says. “I did that for you because you were shocked.” When the waiter returns with our order, he tells Piker that he is comping the cold brew. “Wait, why?” Piker asks. “I just like your vibe,” the server says. A lot of people like Piker’s vibe. His brand — a two-fold critique of Israel and the billionaire class — has made him a multimillionaire. And a foil. Anti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt has accused him of using his platform to promote “toxic anti-Zionism.” Andrew Cuomo invoked Piker’s name repeatedly along the campaign trail in an effort to smear Mamdani. On this morning, Piker has just arrived via red-eye from his home in Los Angeles for an appearance at the New Yorker Festival; his inclusion in the lineup already sparked a wave of outrage. Wearing a no-logo sweatshirt, sweatpants, a “Free Palestine” wristband and an Apple watch and carrying a small Gucci bag that holds his Zyn supply, Piker signals a cross between conspicuous consumption and Bernie bro. Lurking beneath a camo hat emblazoned with the word “Thieves” is a mind that poses one of the biggest PR threats to the pro-Israel set. The Jersey-born, Istanbul-raised, Rutgers-educated provocateur has no plans to back down. “These last two years, I’ve been called antisemitic. I abhor antisemitism, and I’ve spent my entire professional media career combating it. I just happen to be anti-Israel, and that makes me a far greater threat than the likes of Nick Fuentes because they know he’s a Nazi,” he says, referring to yet another polarizing figure in the ongoing schism within the far right. “I don’t find kinship with the right because I think there are some on the right that just use Israel as a new opportunity to cut through the noise.” His voice, famous from 2,674 livestreams — or 18,624 hours in front of a camera — since he started on Twitch in 2018, is steady and evokes the East Coast liberal arts poli sci education he received. “Maybe they see kinship with me, but I’ve been there for decades,” he says. “Because this is a problem that predates Oct. 7. That’s why a lot of people in the know shortly after Oct. 7, myself included, were like, ‘This is horrifying.’ But the reasons as to why this is happening is because of 75 years of apartheid at that point, the genocide that was the inception of the Israeli nation-state. And most people were just so oblivious to that reality. They were like, ‘How dare you say something so barbaric? How dare you say something instead of just sitting there silently and mourning?’ But there has never been a moment in my life where I ever considered Israel to be anything but a criminal enterprise.” Hanging with Hasan plays out a bit like one of his marathon streams on Twitch, a hybrid of live television and social media that allows creators to interact with fans via chat. The hours float by as he flits from one topic to the next, a mix of politics and pop culture. He’s disgusted by Hollywood’s treatment of pro-Palestinian voices who have lost career opportunities, such as “Scream” actress Melissa Barrera (whose firing from the franchise happened, he says, at “the peak of the panic”). Some have been dropped by their agencies, including Susan Sarandon (“Love her”) by UTA, or their labels, like Roger Waters (“He’s awesome”), over their Israel critiques. More recently, British punk rap duo Bob Vylan was cut by UTA for leading chants of “Death to the IDF” during a performance at Glastonbury Festival. “I don’t think that is necessarily going too far,” Piker says of Bob Vylan’s actions. “I think the moment that you start talking about Jewish control or the Talmud is when people go too far. As a Muslim who sees so much Islamophobia, I’m very tuned in to that dog whistle, like the overemphasis on sharia.” (The notion that Mamdani would impose sharia law on New York was indicative of the tenor of the final stretch of the mayoral race.) “They do it to Jewish people as well in a similar vein. I think that’s when people go too far.” From Piker’s perspective, Amy Schumer should have been canceled for social media posts she made in the wake of Oct. 7. “Amy was going crazy — and no punishments there. She was just straight-up being like, ‘They’re all rapists, barbaric monsters. They’re head choppers. We got to deal with them.’” (Piker appears to be referencing an illustration Schumer shared and then deleted on Instagram that depicted pro-Palestinian supporters holding signs with such slogans as “Gazans rape Jewish girls only in self defense” and “Proud of our rapist martyrs.”) Despite calls for his cancellation for his criticism of Israel, Piker has withstood the heat. “WME didn’t drop me, which I think is very interesting,” he says. He was told to tone it down, but he’s vague about exactly who told him. “‘He’s getting a little too hot’ is what I heard,” he says. Did he heed that warning? “No, because I’m very stubborn, and if something is wrong, I’m going to call it out, and if I can’t call it out, then I can’t do my job. That’s my job. That’s what I do. So yes, I’ve gotten warnings, and I’m not oblivious.” Journalist Taylor Lorenz, a friend of Piker’s who has covered the subject of internet harassment for 15 years, says that he is unique in the breadth of his haters, from Vice President JD Vance to Democratic Rep. Ritchie Torres. “Hasan has a very particular strain of politics, which is leftism that is attacked by both mainstream centrist Democrats, bad-faith left-wing actors, the right wing and just internet trolls,” Lorenz says. “And he’s on the most dramatic platform possible, Twitch, which has the most parasocial fan base of any platform. He gets the entire internet weaponized against him. He is the only straight man I’ve ever seen that has been Gamergated.” Earlier this year, Mamdani’s mother, director Mira Nair, signed a petition calling for the Academy to rescind its invitation to Gal Gadot to appear at the Oscars for “her support for Israel’s military actions against Palestinians.” Given that Gadot’s comments throughout the conflict have centered on releasing the hostages, I ask Piker if such a campaign was fair. “I think she should be banned from the Oscars for being a dogshit actress. I think she has no business being there for the crime of what she has done to not only the DC franchise, but really any movie she’s been a part of,” he says of the “Wonder Woman” star. “All jokes aside, Gal Gadot serves an important role in normalizing Israel as not a fascist ethno-state, but instead a place where a lot of beautiful women come from. And those beautiful women happen to serve in the IDF, because there’s also this weird sexualization of the forces as well that takes place, and it plays another role in normalizing Israel and its activities and actions, and whitewashing it.” By contrast, Piker appreciates the work of Natalie Portman, who is Israeli but never served in the IDF like Gadot. “If Gal Gadot could act like Natalie Portman, there’re probably less people yelling at her. Natalie Portman has made statements about Israel that are middle of the road, but ultimately nobody holds that against her. Because she can act her freaking face off, all the way back when she was like a teenager. Oh my God, ‘Léon: The Professional.’” Gadot may have ruined the DC franchise for Piker, but James Gunn is redeeming it. When “Superman” opened on July 11, Piker made viral the idea that the fictional nation of Boravia is a stand-in for Israel. In the film, Boravia, backed by U.S.-made weaponry, drops bombs on and oppresses its desert neighbor, prompting Superman to intercede. Gunn has since denied that the plotline has “anything to do with the Middle East.” “James Gunn is a lot more woke than he lets on. And he lets on how woke he is all the time,” Piker says, still certain of the director and DC chief’s intention all these months later. “Come on, man, you made the [Boravian leader] look like David Ben-Gurion. He just straight-up looks one-to-one like the first prime minister of Israel. We don’t even care what you say about this. We know exactly what we’re looking at.” To take the allegory a step further, Palantir, BlackRock and Raytheon are LuthorCorp. “Lex Luthor is cutting a direct contract with Boravia to extract natural resources and then also have a testing ground for their weapons,” Piker says. “I mean, that’s literally what we do. Gaza is a weapons laboratory. That’s how imperialism works.” Apropos of something, Piker then gives a thumbs-up to the actor who suited up as the latest Man of Steel. “David Corenswet, from what I understand, is Jewish, and he’s very cool. He’s not like pro-Israel or anything like that either, as far as I’ve seen,” he notes. With that, Piker is ready to move on to cross-Burbank superhero rival Marvel. But there’s little for him to mine on that front. “I’ve always been a Marvel fan growing up, but I cannot stand the Marvel Cinematic Universe,” he says. Piker’s intensity is palpable as he chases a double espresso with a 6 mg Zyn pouch. All that’s missing is the scroll of chat comments accompanying his musings. Instead, swooning fans enter the real-life frame to express their gratitude. A woman dining with her son approaches our table. “No, no, it’s impossible. He lives in L.A.,” she says, beaming. “And then I kept looking and looking and … it’s him! I absolutely love your work.” “Being a Twitch streamer is a lot of that,” he says of his exchange with the server. “I have my ear to the ground all the time. A lot of people in legacy media, traditional journalists, are so out of step with the average person around them, even in their immediate vicinity.” Still, Piker allows the rich and powerful to occupy plenty of space in his head. Bari Weiss, the recently installed editor-in-chief of CBS News, gets a bashing. “Bari Weiss is everything that I despise about access journalism brown-nosing to institutionally powerful people and a major advocate for Israel as well. A person that has spent her entire career decrying woke or identity politics while simultaneously using her identity as a shield,” he says. “Like, ‘I’m a lesbian woman. I can’t be intolerant.’ And also even using your identity as a Jewish woman to say, ‘Identity politics sucks unless we’re talking about Jewish people.’” Piker scoffs at the idea that CBS News was biased before Weiss arrived. “There’s not enough pro-Israel voices in major news? Come on. That’s ridiculous,” he says. “Yet she’s been rewarded handsomely for it — $150 million for her shitty Substack that no one cares about or knows about. It’s very obvious why that happened. The Redstones [the seller] and the Ellisons [the buyer] wanted to make CBS more pro-Israel. Shari Redstone was willing to hand off CBS to the Ellisons because she thought they would do a better job of making it more pro-Israel.” (When the Paramount deal was announced in August, Redstone said Ellison “has a clear strategic vision and the resources to take [the studio] to its next stage of growth.”) Since the deal closed, the studio has made a series of moves that bolster Piker’s contention that Paramount is now more Israel-friendly. In September, it denounced a petition signed by celebrities including Emma Stone and Javier Bardem that called for a boycott of Israeli film institutions implicated in “genocide and apartheid” against Palestinians. Last month, “CBS Mornings” co-host Tony Dokoupil interviewed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv. “Bari Weiss was being packaged as someone who could bring top talent. Wow,” Piker says. “Benjamin Netanyahu never gives interviews anymore to American news? He talks to American news more than he does the Israeli news.” Perhaps it’s Piker’s complete lack of filter that makes him so attractive to his growing fan base. Most influencers with a red-hot career are careful not to bite a Hollywood hand that could feed them. As a result, these aspiring stars tend to punch down. Piker is willing to punch way up. All the way up to Larry Ellison, the second-richest person on the planet, who backed his son David’s successful bid to buy Paramount and also has a stake in TikTok. Piker is trying to explain the craven flip of the once-liberal tech titan to the Republican side. “When Larry Ellison first made that big donation to Marco Rubio [for his presidential run in 2016], people were actually a bit confused. I think he’s gay. Maybe in the closet. I don’t know. I hope he doesn’t laser me down for speculating,” he says with a laugh about the Oracle co-founder. (Larry Ellison has been married to six women and is currently wed to Jolin Zhu.) “But there are [hacked] emails that show Larry Ellison vetted Marco Rubio for fealty to Israel. And as secretary of state, Rubio played a role in the TikTok talks and steered the company towards Ellison.” Piker doesn’t seem too concerned about the prospect of getting “lasered down” by any vengeful oligarch. “I’m also not a stranger to super powerful social media platform-owning billionaires directly hating me and making it a personal vendetta and their life’s mission to destroy me somehow,” he says. In the wake of the Kirk assassination, Elon Musk took to his X to call for Piker’s cancellation, dredging up past comments that walked up to the line. Musk even tagged Amazon founder Jeff Bezos (Amazon owns Twitch). Piker notes the irony that he’s not even banned on X, never mind Twitch, because he’s a power user and drives engagement. “A lot of these guys are very thin-skinned, and I think the gravest mistake of my career was when I had [Musk’s ex-partner] Grimes on my show and she talked about how buff I was, and then I talked about how Tesla was shit,” Piker says. “That man has never lived it down.” Grimes wasn’t exaggerating. Piker is hard to miss with his muscular 6-foot-4 frame. He works out one to two hours a day, a regimen that includes playing basketball. If he ingratiated himself better with the oligarchs, he would be courted by mainstream Hollywood. He’s already heard the siren call and turned it down. His manager, former WME agent David Huntzinger, fielded a $1 million offer from one popular betting platform to run a ticker ad during just one stream on election night 2024. Piker said no. “I’m not the easiest client. And not even because I get into trouble,” Piker explains. “I say no all the time to a lot of deals, like a lot of money. And that’s why I really respect David, because throughout our entire professional relationship, he has probably said no to tens of millions of dollars. Starting number was $1 million, which means they could have probably gone up.” He’s happier helping the Mamdanis of the Democratic Party and sticking a thorn in the side of the Cuomo types. “He brought up my name next to Hamas. He said [during a debate with Mamdani], ‘Why don’t you denounce Hamas? Why don’t you denounce Hasan Piker?’” Piker says of the former Democratic governor turned Independent mayoral candidate. “I’m very similar to Zohran in many respects, and the same reasons why they would be resentful of Zohran or fearful of Zohran is the same reason why they despise me.” With the election just 10 days away, Piker is keeping a low profile with the Mamdani campaign. “I’m in a holding pattern right now” he says, a hint of sadness creeping into his voice. “I don’t want to be too prominent in and around the Zohran stuff at the moment because I don’t want them to use it as a line of attack over and over again.” What the Cuomo campaign used was a sound bite of Piker saying, “America deserved 9/11” during a 2019 stream. “I was talking about blowback, a theory that has academic consensus at this point, that our meddling in the affairs of the Middle East has led to the blowback of 9/11,” he explains. “This wasn’t to say 9/11 is good. It’s a horrifying act of terror where 3,000 New Yorkers were slaughtered and even many more with the first responders that tried to save as many people as possible. Yet it was, of course, weaponized against me.” But as election night swung Mamdani’s way, Piker wasn’t keeping a low profile but toasting the millennial mayor-elect with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez at the Brooklyn Paramount victory party. There he offered no mercy for Cuomo. “What happened? I thought the ‘Hasan loves 9/11’ was a successful campaign strategy?” he said in a video that ran on his YouTube channel. “Andrew Cuomo, fuck you. Suck my dick.” Before the Mamdani win becomes a reality, however, Piker can only hope the polls are accurate. But he’s feeling confident as we walk along a busy stretch of 10th Avenue. An older man wearing a bandanna and hoop earrings stops in his tracks and claps as he recognizes Piker. It’s a sign that the streamer’s message about Mamdani and/or Israel is resonating. Then, it hits me that Piker has no security detail as he mingles with the masses. Post-Kirk, that seems unwise. “I make it a point not to have bodyguards when I’m around the people,” he says. “I think it was, was it Fidel Castro or Che Guevara who said, ‘I have a moral vest’?” It was Castro.

Title: The American Enterprise Institute (AEI) Is “Counterfeit Libertarianism”

The American Enterprise Institute (AEI). Framed as a right-wing conservative think tank originally organized in 1938, AEI is yet another political bipartisan NGO with a stated mission to improve American freedom and democrat capitalism via prolonged wars. Thought leaders and scholars are billed as saints and prophets whose words of wisdom must be absorbed without critical question as they guide the US thru an illusion of grandeur. In reality, AEI is a conglomerate of every neoconservative war hawk to walk this earth. At the forefront of their research is the full blown rhetoric of China Bad and Putin is an Antisemite parlayed under the guise that they are Libertarian in their beliefs and motives. And from these very politically motivated two points they define the means of global disruption and nuclear war. Funding includes such sources as Bill Gates, Charles Koch Foundation, Sarah Scaife Foundation, The Carlyle Group, Bradley Foundation, etc. Working in alignment with the coup operatives National Endowment for Democracy and Center For Strategic and International Studies, AEI is simply another cog in the dementia world of coups, regime change, riots, and geoengineered weather wars. While funding planned parenthood, these prophets and scholars assert that intelligence is hereditary, therefore, eugenics is the answer and vaccines are the means. DNA derived bioweapons. In 2003, AEI launched NGO Watch in collaboration with the Federalist Society For Law and Public Policy Studies. The purpose statements claims NGO Watch will provide greater transparency to bring accountability to the NGO sector. It went defunct in 2007 and was relaunched in 2009 with Jewish Zionist Jon Entine as its editor. It goes without saying that NGO Watch was formed by two NGO’s. The wolf watching the chicken coup… (yes I am aware of the spelling). In essence the NGO’s are a composite of neoconservative vs neoliberal with the common goal of micro-managing the White House. It is fair to say that since taking office, President Trump has not leaned on the libertarian policies as outlined in Project 2025 by the Heritage Foundation. The Project called for elimination of entire federal departments, merit based workers, defunding NIH, flat tax, smaller government, less, less. None of which happened. Heritage president, Kevin Roberts, was recently forced to ‘apologize’ for defending Tucker Carlson’s interview with Nick Fuentes. After a series of resignations from the Heritage Foundation, condemnations from Jewish Republican figures, and a letter of demands from the National Task Force to Combat Antisemitism, Kevin Roberts apologized for allowing Carlson and Fuentes Free Speech. The Mises Institute, a Libertarian Movement, that holds to the last vestige of pure Libertarianism details the train wreck that became President Trump in his anti-Libertarian principles and policies. President of the Mises Institute, Thomas DiLorenzo, remains pure to the identity and is highly critical of the neoconservatism and military interventionism advocated for by AEI and its CSIS and NED affiliates. There are now over 1.5 million US NGO’s all exclaiming their expert scholarly status whether an adjunct to the right or the left. Unfortunately, outside of Mises, the entity that was Libertarian no longer exists. The ideology has been hijacked by neoconservatives bent on War – in complete contrast to the most basic tenets of Libertarianism, and by the Jewish Money Changers supporting those wars. They wear masks, they carry big sticks, and they wield destruction as the solution to the New Age of the Georgia GuideStones. Every year they congregate at Sea Island, Georgia for their World Forum in private to plan their next attack on a sovereign nation. Today, that attack would be the geoengineering of a severe drought in Iran. Regime change in Venezuela. The genocide of Lebanon by Israel. And giving US tax dollars to grifters such as Zelenskyy and Milei. In 2024, to prove their subservience to the deep state, the AEI World Forum meeting was a roundtable of both Biden Democrats, Obama Democrats, Hillary Democrats, The BlackRock entourage and Bush/Zionist Republicans comprising the Uniparty. The terms ‘conservative’ or ‘right leaning’, no longer direct a reality but instead use the terms to direct an illusion. Trump is not making America Great. He is not a conservative or Libertarian. He is making America a pariah nation triggering constant CHAOS with support from neoconservative and Zionist NGO’s. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: BNY Eyes $1.5T Stablecoin Market With New Reserve Fund for Issuers
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/11/13/bny-eyes-usd1-5t-stablecoin-market-with-new-reserve-fund-for-issuers

Full Content:
BNY, one of the oldest banks in the U.S., is rolling out a new money market fund aimed at helping stablecoin issuers meet federal reserve requirements under U.S. regulations, the firm announced on Thursday. The BNY Dreyfus Stablecoin Reserves Fund (BSRXX) is designed to hold cash-equivalent reserves for stablecoins issued under the GENIUS Act, a federal law enacted earlier this year that created a legal framework for U.S. dollar-pegged digital currencies. The fund doesn’t hold any stablecoins itself but acts as a regulated vehicle for backing them. The move comes as stablecoins, a set of cryptocurrencies with prices tied to fiat money like the U.S. dollar, are rapidly growing as a means of payment, with regulations addressing this sector of the broader crypto market being put in place across the globe. The stablecoin market could reach to $1.5 trillion by the end of the decade from its current $300 billion market size, BNY projected. "Cash is the cornerstone of the digital asset ecosystem, enabling global capital markets to move toward an always-on, 24/7 environment," Stephanie Pierce, deputy head of BNY Investments, said in a statement. "Stablecoins are at the forefront of this profound transformation." With the fund, BNY aims to provide a key piece of infrastructure for stablecoin issuers to maintain the value of the tokens. Global asset manager BlackRock, for example, launched the Circle Reserve Fund, which manages $66 billion of U.S. Treasuries and repos serving as reserve for the USDC stablecoin. Anchorage Digital, a federally chartered U.S. crypto bank, provided the fund’s initial investment. "This fund represents the infrastructure needed to make compliant stablecoin issuance possible at scale," said Anchorage CEO Nathan McCauley in a statement. The fund is open to qualified institutional investors, including those acting in custodial, brokerage or fiduciary roles. BNY says the move is part of a broader push to support the growing overlap between traditional finance and blockchain-based assets.

The company simultaneously announced Circle Partner Stablecoins, a program supporting select regional stablecoin deployments on Arc, creating a unified infrastructure stack for global FX activity, according to a press release shared with Decrypt. The dual offerings is built on Arc’s Layer-1 blockchain, whose public testnet went live last month with over 100 participants, including BlackRock, Visa, Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, Standard Chartered, BNY, State Street, ICE, AWS, Cloudflare, Mastercard, Coinbase, Kraken, Robinhood, and others. The initiative targets inefficiencies in the foreign exchange market, which still operates on fragmented venues, prefunded accounts, and T+1 settlement cycles. T+1 settlement means when you trade an asset, the actual transfer of money and ownership happens the next business day, not immediately. By combining Arc's programmable settlement infrastructure with stablecoin-powered trading, Circle seeks to enable real-time cross-border currency exchange with reduced counterparty risk and capital requirements. “With StableFX and Circle Partner Stablecoins, we’re connecting the world’s currencies on Arc,” Circle Chief Product and Technology Officer Nikhil Chandhok said in the press release. The announcement follows Circle's strong third-quarter performance, with the company reporting $740 million in revenue and reserve income, surpassing analyst forecasts by 66% year over year. USDC’s market capitalization has risen from $61 billion at Circle’s June IPO to over $76 billion, according to CoinGecko, still trailing Tether’s USDT, which tops $184 billion. StableFX operates through a request-for-quote execution model connecting institutions with multiple liquidity providers, offering competitive pricing with low slippage. The platform features on-chain settlement, where both payment and delivery occur simultaneously, eliminating the risk that one party fails to deliver funds after receiving the counterparty's currency. The all-to-all model removes the need for bilateral agreements with multiple counterparties. Currently live on Arc testnet, StableFX is available for approved institutions that have completed Know-Your-Business and Anti-Money Laundering verification ahead of Arc's planned 2026 mainnet launch. Arc uses USDC for transaction fees, features sub-second finality, and includes opt-in privacy configurations designed for institutional compliance requirements. During the testnet launch, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire said the project has shown “remarkable early momentum,” with the firm noting in its Q3 report that it’s exploring the possibility of a native Arc token. Circle Partner Stablecoins targets non-USD-pegged stablecoin issuers meeting technical, operational, and reserve management standards. Initial participants include Avenia (Brazilian real), Forte (Australian dollar), JYPC (Japanese yen), Juno (Mexican peso), BDACS (South Korean won), Stablecorp (Canadian dollar), Luno (South African rand), and Coins.ph (Philippine peso). These stablecoins gain integration into Circle's Payments Network and StableFX, expanding utility beyond domestic markets.

Title: Circle enters world’s largest financial market with onchain FX engine

Circle is seeking to improve FX market infrastructure by offering institutions deeper global liquidity access with fewer intermediaries and reduced counterparty risk. Circle is expanding into the foreign-exchange market, positioning stablecoins as a tool to modernize one of traditional finance’s most entrenched systems. The issuer of USDC (USDC) on Thursday unveiled Circle StableFX, an institutional onchain FX platform built on Arc1, the company’s forthcoming layer-1 blockchain, according to a news release shared with Cointelegraph. Circle also introduced Circle Partner Stablecoins, a program designed to support regulated regional stablecoins. Trading in the global FX market reached $9.6 trillion per day in April, up 28% from 2022, according to data from the Bank of International Settlements (BIS). The daily trading volume in the global FX market is more than double all global stock markets combined, and far exceeds the roughly $1.69 trillion in average daily US equities trading, running 24 hours a day, five days a week, across every major financial center, according to World Bank data shared by Trading Economics. The new FX engine aims to allow compliant institutions access to stablecoin currency pairs with 24/7 onchain settlement at competitive rates and lower counterparty risk. It also aims to enhance efficiency in FX markets by eliminating the need for multiple counterparties and facilitating faster access to global liquidity. “With StableFX and Circle Partner Stablecoins, we’re connecting the world’s currencies on Arc,” said Circle chief product and technology officer, Nikhil Chandhok. Institutions will need to complete comprehensive Know-Your-Business and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) verification to use the “compliance-centric trading environment,” the release said. Circle StableFX has launched on the Arc Testnet, offering developers and institutions the opportunity to explore the solution. The alpha version is scheduled to roll out for approved developers and institutions alongside the Arc mainnet launch in 2026. Related: Crypto’s yield gap with TradFi narrows as staking, RWAs surge Circle’s move into FX marks a growing trend among major crypto companies seeking to reshape traditional markets and claim a share of their revenue. The move into the FX markets may bring a significant new revenue stream for the issuer of the world’s second-largest stablecoin. Circle’s revenue surged to $740 million in the third quarter of the year, marking a 66% year-over-year increase. The stablecoin issuer launched its Arc testnet in October, with participation from investment bank Goldman Sachs, asset manager BlackRock, credit card company Visa and over 100 other companies. Related: Metaplanet’s Bitcoin gains fall 39% as October crash pressures corporate treasuries Coinbase, the second-largest crypto exchange by volume, is also exploring TradFi market opportunities through tokenized stocks, prediction markets and by advancing stablecoin adoption via USDC, as part of its “Everything Exchange” vision. “We laid out our vision of an Everything Exchange last quarter, and made progress in Q3 by increasing the number of tradable spot assets, expanding our derivatives offerings, and continuing to lay the groundwork for additional pillars,” Coinbase said in its Q3 earnings report.

Title: Man charged after cannabis seized at Shannon Airport
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/munster/2025/1113/1543788-sean-grehan-court/
Time Published: 2025-11-13T13:25:45Z
Full Content:
A 28-year old man has been charged in connection with the seizure of €620,000 worth of cannabis at Shannon airport yesterday. Sean Grehan, of Stradbrook Park, Blackrock, Dublin, appeared before Gort District Court this morning. Garda Kevin Molloy told the court he arrested Mr Grehan at 6.10pm yesterday and at 6.20pm charged him with two drugs offences. He said Mr Grehan made no reply. Solicitor Olivia Lynch told Judge Alec Gabbett that there would be no application for bail today but a bail application would be made on behalf of Mr Grehan on his next appearance in court. Mr Grehan is charged with having in his possession, cannabis for the purpose of sale or supply contrary to Section 15 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 at Shannon airport on 12 November. Mr Grehan is also charged with having in his possession cannabis contrary to Section 3 of the Misuse of Drugs Act. Ms Lynch asked for a short remand in custody to allow the application for bail to be made at Mr Grehan's next court appearance. Judge Gabbett said that he could hear the bail application at Ennis District Court tomorrow. Ms Lynch said that she has been in contact with Mr Grehan’s solicitor, Patricia Camilon at KOD Lyons in Dublin, who will make the bail application on Mr Grehan’s behalf at the next court. She asked that she be granted legal aid for today's court appearance after Mr Grehan confirmed to the court that he does not work. Judge Gabbett granted legal aid. Judge Gabbett said that he would remand Mr Grehan in custody to Castlerea prison to appear at Ennis District Court for DPP directions and a bail application. Judge Gabbett asked are there any issues relating to Mr Grehan that prison authorities should know about such as any medical attention required and Ms Lynch replied "no, he is all good". © RTÉ 2025.

Title: Sen. John Kennedy didn't 'execute' AOC, Schumer and other Democratic leaders on C-SPAN
URL: https://www.snopes.com//fact-check/schumer-aoc-john-kennedy/
Time Published: 2025-11-13T12:00:00Z
Full Content:
About this rating A rumor that circulated online in November 2025 claimed a live C-SPAN broadcast showed U.S. Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., scolding Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Democratic Party leadership over their "Green New Deal 2.0" costing $93 trillion. On Nov. 10, a Facebook user named Kienen-Patricia-Natasja shared the claim with a collage of photos of Schumer, Ocasio-Cortez and Kennedy. The post was headlined "KENNEDY JUST EXECUTED AOC, SCHUMER & THE ENTIRE DEM LEADERSHIP ON LIVE C-SPAN – CHAMBER WENT FUNERAL-QUIET IN 38 SECONDS." Other users shared this same story word-for-word on Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn (archived), Truth Social and X (archived), as well as at least two blogs. (Kienen-Patricia-Natasja/Facebook) The post began as follows: KENNEDY JUST EXECUTED AOC, SCHUMER & THE ENTIRE DEM LEADERSHIP ON LIVE C-SPAN – CHAMBER WENT FUNERAL-QUIET IN 38 SECONDS Senate Floor. AOC was mid-sentence, waving her printed Green New Deal 2.0 like a victory flag. "Senator Kennedy refuses to support our $93 trillion climate justice plan because he's a dinosaur who—" Kennedy stood up, slow, holding a plain manila folder labeled "DEM RECEIPTS – DO NOT BEND." He didn't wait for the chair to recognize him. He just started reading, voice like molasses over broken glass: "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Net worth jump 2020-2025: $29,000 → $12.4 million Campaign promise: 'No corporate PAC money' Actual donors: BlackRock, Google, Pfizer – $4.7 million in dark money funneled through ActBlue shells Bartender story: last W-2 showed $26k – while mommy's seven rental properties paid the real bills Green New Deal co-author: Saikat Chakrabarti – fired for funneling $1.2 million to his own LLC" He flipped the page. "Chuck Schumer 'Working class hero' from Brooklyn Current residence: $8.2 million Park Slope brownstone Wife's net worth: $47 million from Goldman Sachs board seat The rest of the post claimed the alleged C-SPAN video received "28 million concurrent viewers," and that "#KennedyMassplode trended #1 worldwide for 36 straight hours." In short, the rumor was false. No such C-SPAN video exists. Kennedy made no such remarks, nor did Ocasio-Cortez — a House member — speak on the Senate floor. The story featured fabricated details about Ocasio-Cortez, as well as Schumer and his wife, Iris Weinshall, all likely written with the help of artificial-intelligence tools. A scan of the text with AI-detection tools (which are not always reliable) produced differing results, with Copyleaks concluding a 100% likelihood of AI-generated content and ZeroGPT displaying a 1.88% match. As of Nov. 10, the Kienen-Patricia-Natasja Facebook page's "page transparency" tab listed at least two of its managers as residing in Vietnam. By Nov. 11, that number changed to one page manager in Vietnam. Snopes previously reported many stories about Vietnam-run Facebook pages promoting fabricated, AI-generated stories about celebrities, politics and disasters. Other Facebook pages also featured the same false story alongside comments featuring links to advertisement-filled blog articles. Those Facebook pages showed page managers residing in Vietnam. We contacted the Kienen-Patricia-Natasja Facebook page via Messenger to ask its owners about their fabricated content — featuring many other completely fictional stories with writing resembling AI-generated content, as well as AI-generated images of Kennedy — and will update this story if we receive more information. The fabricated story contained several false or entirely unsubstantiated claims about Ocasio-Cortez and Schumer. Regarding the $12.4 million net-worth claim, we previously reported on the false rumor that Ocasio-Cortez became a multimillionaire after being elected to Congress. Searches of Bing, DuckDuckGo, Google and Yahoo located no information about Ocasio-Cortez receiving $4.7 million in "dark money" campaign contributions, nor did searches find details to confirm her mother owned seven rental properties. One part of the post said Saikat Chakrabarti, Ocasio-Cortez's former chief of staff, was "fired for funneling $1.2 million to his own LLC." A search for Chakrabarti's name found Politico reporting in early August 2019 that he had resigned. A New York Post article also featured some details of an investigation involving Chakrabarti allegedly funneling more than $1 million to two LLCs. In January 2022, the Federal Election Commission dismissed a case involving Chakrabarti after voting 3-3, indicating a failure to find reason to believe he violated a federal election law regarding dollar limits on contributions. As for Schumer and the claim about an $8.2 million apartment, The New York Times reported he purchased his Park Slope apartment in Brooklyn — not a brownstone — in 1983. Observer.com reported the purchase occurred in 1982, at a cost of $157,000. Regarding Iris Weinshall, Schumer's wife, The New York Public Library's website listed her as its chief operating officer and treasurer. A Google search for "has Iris Weinshall worked for Goldman Sachs" displays a result making it appear as if she truly once worked for the bank and investment company, as the fabricated story claimed. That search result description text read, "Earlier in her career, she worked for Goldman Sachs in the Investment Banking Division." However, that sentence applied to a different person's biography on the library website, not Weinshall's. This mention of Goldman Sachs appeared in a different person's biography. For further reading, we previously investigated other untrue claims about Ocasio-Cortez, including one alleging her brother was arrested after police found him in possession of $1.2 million worth of fentanyl.

Title: Former BBC exec Marc Allen launches BlackRock-backed TV, film royalty acquisition platform Easttree Media
URL: https://www.c21media.net/news/former-bbc-exec-marc-allen-launches-blackrock-backed-tv-film-royalty-acquisition-platform-easttree-media/
Time Published: 2025-11-13T10:57:12Z
Full Content:
Former BBC executive Marc Allen has joined forces with private equity veterans Chris Helm and Markku Lonnqvist to launch a BlackRock-backed investment platform for acquiring income rights to TV and film content. Marc Allen Income rights in film and TV are payments made to creators for the ongoing use of their work after its initial release, primarily through royalties and residuals. Based in the UK, Easttree Media is looking to acquire these rights from prodcos, studios, financiers and other rights holders, mirroring a trend already seen in the music industry in recent years. Founded last year, Easttree is backed by funds and accounts managed by US asset management giant BlackRock, which partnered with Warner Music Group in 2022 to buy up stakes in music copyrights. Royalty acquisition platform Easttree claims to have already completed multiple transactions involving TV shows, “establishing itself as a proven partner for rights holders seeking to unlock value.” Allen brings experience from the entertainment space as a former production executive for the BBC, MD of Leeds-based True North Productions and chief operating officer of London-headquartered management and production company 42. Helm previously served as chief financial officer of Hipgnosis Songs Funds, overseeing acquisitions of music catalogues. Lonnqvist, meanwhile, most recently served as chief investment officer at Hipgnosis Song Management and was previously a partner at Pamplona Capital Management. Allen said: “Being able to provide such a service for such a broad range of talent, as well as sophisticated, high-value solutions for the world’s largest film and TV entertainment industry players, gives us a unique opportunity to work with creators, producers and platforms across the whole film and TV spectrum regardless of scale.” Helm added: “Our vision is to approach film and TV participations through a fresh lens – bringing transparency, alignment and partnerships that serve talent. “We’re firm believers that acquirers of music rights can scale, succeed commercially and still advocate for artists. We are bringing that same conviction to film and television, turning these income rights into a transformative new asset class.” Paul Braude, head of the Direct Private Opportunities group at BlackRock, said: “Iconic film and television titles continue to attract audiences well beyond their initial release, and we believe these assets provide our clients with even greater choice to meet their investment needs alongside access to distinctive and durable source of returns.”

Title: Have We Entered a New Feudal Era?

Investiture of a knight (miniature from the statutes of the Order of the Knot, founded in 1352 by Louis I of Naples) – Public Domain Ever since the Internet was born, along with Big Tech, in the 1990s, the world has had a sense that we have entered a new era in global political economy. Many have tried to place a finger on what this transformation is all about. Perhaps the most famous among these critical thinkers is Shoshana Zuboff, who wrote that we are living in an era of “surveillance capitalism,” wherein our harvesting information from cyberspace also provides Google, Microsoft, and other tech titans the opportunity to rake in data about us that they process to create our digital profiles. These profiles are then used by them or their client corporations to manipulate us into purchasing products or are sold to the state, which has an interest in keeping tabs on us. Another important effort to define what was new came from Mckenzie Wark, who wrote in her influential Hacker’s Manifesto that the central contradiction of the new age was no longer that between capital and labor but between “hackers,” or the sources of innovation and creativity who wanted to keep information free, and the “vectoral ruling class” that sought to expropriate knowledge and turn it into a commodity. Acknowledging his debt to both Zuboff and Wark, Yanis Varoufakis says that while they have important insights, they have not followed these to their logical conclusion: that capitalism as a distinct mode of production has been superseded. The synthesis that Varoufakis offers is what he calls “technofeudalism.” He does not say that capitalists no longer matter. They do, and they still engage in extracting surplus value or profit from workers in the process of production. But they themselves are subordinate to a new elite, the “cloud capitalists” or “cloudalists,” who have privatized the commons that was cyberspace and now control access to it. The cloudalists, among the most powerful of which are Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and the chipmaker Nvidia, control the globe-spanning information highways that are sustained materially by massive data centers located in different parts of the world. Accessing these intermeshed networks in cyberspace known as the “cloud” is now vital for the traditional or “terrestrial” capitalists to get access to you to sell their products, and these corporate gatekeepers make their money by charging these capitalists rent. Without access to the net, capitalists cannot make profits, and, very much like the feudal lords of yore who controlled land, the cloudalists’ monopolistic control of the cloud allows them to directly or indirectly collect, from the “vassal capitalists” and anyone who uses the net, “rent,” or income that is not subject to the market competition on which profit depends. Cloud Proles and Cloud Serfs As in capitalism, it is not the cloudalists or the terrestrial capitalists that produce value. The real sources of value are what Varoufakis calls the “cloud proles” and the “cloud serfs.” The cloud proles are the service workers at Amazon and other Big Tech facilities who are nonunionized, paid meager wages, and in constant threat of being displaced by robots and Artificial Intelligence. But these proles’ labor provides only a fraction of the value extracted by the cloudalists. It is the cloud serfs that create most of that value. Following Zuboff, Varoufakis says the cloud serfs are most of us: we provide raw material for the cloud whenever we do a Google search, post a photo on Facebook, or order a book on Amazon, material that is then processed into information that the cloudalists and terrestrial capitalists can use to develop ever more sophisticated marketing strategies to get us to part with our dollars. The distinguishing characteristic of cloud serfs is they are doing unpaid work for the cloudalists even if they don’t realize it. As he remarks, “The fact that we do so voluntarily, happily even, does not detract from the fact that we are unpaid manufacturers—cloud serfs whose daily self-directed toil enriches a tiny band of multibillionaires.” We are, in other words, the unsuspecting marks of the ultimate scam. The Rise of Cloud Capital Varoufakis traces the rise of the cloudalists to the central banks’ creation of money with zero or below zero interest in the aftermath of the Great Recession of 2008 and, later, during the COVID 19 pandemic, to stimulate production and consumer spending. But, with the big fall in demand, most corporations did not invest the loans the private banks channeled to them, instead using them to buy back their own corporate stocks at low prices or invest it in real estate. But cloudalists like Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, and Mark Zuckerberg used the central bank money rerouted to them by the big banks to massively invest in expanding and monopolizing the cloud. The cloudalists mopped up many of the billions sloshing around within the financial system. With them, they paid for server farms, fibre optic cables, artificial intelligence laboratories, gargantuan warehouses, software developers, top-notch engineers, laboratories, promising start-ups and all the rest. In an environment where profit had become optional, the cloudalists seized upon the central bank money to build a new empire. Resistance in the Era of Technofeudalism The central contradiction in the technofeudal era has passed from the conflict between labor and capital to that between the cloudalists and their cloud serfs and cloud proles. Varoufakis is my colleague in the international council of Progressive International (PI), and he has helped inspire PI’s partnership with the Switzerland-based UNI Global Union to organize annual one-day strikes by Amazon workers in many countries. According to him, if these actions could be coordinated with Amazon users, so that a critical mass of them are convinced not to visit the Amazon website for even one day, the impact would not be minimal: “Even if were only mildly successful, causing say a 10 percent drop in Amazon’s usual revenues, while Amazon’s warehouse strike disrupted deliveries for 24 hours, such action might prove enough to push Amazon’s share price down in ways that no traditional labor action could achieve.” But building a strong resistance movement to the cloudalists will have to go beyond such momentary alliances. “To stand any chance of overthrowing technofeudalism and putting the demos back into democracy,” he writes, “we need to gather together not just the traditional proletariat and the crowd proles but also the cloud serfs and, indeed, some of the vassal capitalists.” Varoufakis might have added to this “grand coalition” the communities whose lives have been disrupted by Big Data. As a recent New York Times article reports, As data centers rise, the sites — which need vast amounts of power for computing and water to cool the computers — have contributed to or exacerbated disruptions not only in Mexico, but in more than a dozen other countries…In Ireland, data centers consume more than 20 percent of the country’s electricity. In Chile, precious aquifers are in danger of depletion. In South Africa, where blackouts have long been routine, data centers are further taxing the national grid. Similar concerns have surfaced in Brazil, Britain, India, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Singapore and Spain. Communities forced to host data centers, in fact, are now the cutting edge of resistance to Big Tech. In country after country, notes the report, “activists, residents and environmental organizations have banded together to oppose data centers. Some have tried blocking the projects, while others have pushed for more oversight and transparency.” Clarification Needed I have a few comments on some of the key elements of Varoufakis’ paradigm, and these are advanced in a critical but friendly spirit: First, his conceptualization of the proles appears to include only the low-paid service workers. What about the information engineers and other knowledge specialists and their office staffs? He talks about the role of the “technostructure” in late capitalism in the early part of the book, but it seems he includes the different layers of this stratum in management during the technofeudal era rather than in labor, though as Mckenzie Wark stressed, technical innovators or “hackers” contribute to the value that is expropriated by the Big Tech elite. Second, there is some ambiguity in the book when it comes to who exactly has the ultimate power in the technofeudal power structure. In most of the book, the billionaire leaders of the Big Tech firms like Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, and Tim Cook, are portrayed as the power elite. But he also writes about the “financial uber-lords [who] rival the cloudalists—three U.S. companies with powers exceeding those of private equity and all terrestrial capitalists put together: BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street. These three firms, the Big Three as they are known in financial circles, effectively own American capitalism.” This is due to the controlling shares they own in the most strategic corporations. So, do we have a split power elite with blocs that have different sources of power? Are we really in a post-capitalist era or merely in another (higher? hyper?) stage of capitalism? This relates to my third point, which is that Varoufakis must do more explaining of how the dynamics of technofeudalism are really distinct from those of monopoly capitalism. Economists, both progressive and orthodox, have long contended that in a situation of monopoly or oligopoly, as in the car industry or pharmaceuticals, the key players derive profit but they also extract rent, which is profit in excess of what would be available if there were significant market competition. As in the car and drug industries, there is in the Big Tech sector both oligopoly and fierce competition, much of it “non-price competition,” the dynamics of which results in both profit and rent. Are not the dynamics of cloudalist competition really the same? How does monopoly capitalist rent differ from technofeudal rent? How do the earnings of Google, for instance, differ from those of non-Big Tech oligopolists like JP Morgan, Johnson and Johnson, and Toyota, except perhaps in terms of volume? My last point has to do with the changing relationship between the state and the cloudalists. In the book, the state mainly appears as an enabler of the rise of the cloudalists via the central banks’ provision of free money in the aftermath of the Great Recession and during the pandemic. Recent developments, however, have seen the state disciplining Big Tech and curbing its freedom of maneuver. Under both the first Trump administration and Biden’s presidency, Washington imposed fairly restrictive measures that cut into the profits of the cloudalists, like the sharing of advanced information technology with Chinese corporations. For instance, export controls on advanced AI chips imposed by Biden in 2022 have drastically reduced Nvidia’s share of the Chinese AI chip market from 95 percent to 50 percent, resulting in the loss of billions of dollars. Under the second Trump administration, Washington has moved even more drastically, using the imposition of tariffs to force cloudalists like Apple to move key parts of their global supply chains to the United States, though this would involve major costs and disruptions. But acknowledging the state’s commanding role, Apple CEO Tim Cook stated recently, “The president wants more [production] in the US…Apple also wants more in the US.” On Accurately Naming the Beast Varoufakis does note the more prominent role of the state represented by these latest developments. However, he does not fully draw out their implications for what he has portrayed as the immense power of the cloudalists and what lies ahead for them. From the enabler of the cloudalists portrayed in Technofeudalism, the relationship between the state and Big Tech in the United States is becoming more like that between the Chinese Communist Party regime and China’s data titans like Alibaba and Baidu, as the geopolitical rivalry heats up and national security concerns, not profitability, take center stage. China’s political economy has been called state capitalism or political capitalism (with only the Communist Party of China clinging on to Deng Xiaoping’s definition of it as “socialism with Chinese characteristics”). Varoufakis contends that the choice of a name is critical to understanding the essence of a political economy. I agree. But to underline what is likely to be become an even bigger directive role for the state in the political economy of the United States and the increasing subordination of profitability to national security, I think we need a better word than “technofeudalism.” (This would have the added benefit of avoiding the subliminal association of the title to Friedrich Hayek’s classic anti-socialist neoliberal tract, The Road to Serfdom.) Technofeudalism is a provocative piece of analysis, well-argued and well-written. And it is very accessible to those with little background in political economy or economics. There may be areas where I may not completely agree or points that I feel should be more carefully elaborated, but these should not detract from my judgment that this book by one of today’s leading progressive thinkers is a major contribution to understanding the times we live in. Walden Bello, a columnist for Foreign Policy in Focus, is the author or co-author of 19 books, the latest of which are Capitalism’s Last Stand? (London: Zed, 2013) and State of Fragmentation: the Philippines in Transition (Quezon City: Focus on the Global South and FES, 2014).

They’ve got a fresh vacancy for an iconic forward in Cork. Brian Hayes, one the county’s latest All Stars, may yet fill the void left by Patrick Horgan. Or perhaps it’ll be Alan Connolly. Few players, in Cork or beyond, possess the same potential to excite as the 24-year-old Blackrock clubman. In five seasons as a Cork senior hurler, Connolly has scored 24 goals in 41 league and championship games, a neat dozen goals in each competition. There are four competitive hat-tricks in there too, the latest registered against Dublin in this year’s All-Ireland semi-final, in addition to three games in which he netted twice. That’s Hoggy-esque scoring. Though rewind a couple of years and Connolly wasn’t so sure he’d even get a proper run at it. Shoulder surgery and then hamstring trouble cost him the entire 2023 season and when he eventually returned in March 2024, he spoke of the ‘dark place’ from which he’d just emerged. “I probably haven’t been fit for the past three years,” he acknowledged at the time. He started all 15 of Cork’s championship games since then across 2024 and 2025, winning a Munster medal this season and lining out in two All-Ireland finals. The journey will continue when preseason training resumes shortly under new manager Ben O’Connor. “I can’t wait to get back,” said Connolly at an event to promote Blackrock’s car raffle fundraiser. “It’s relentless obviously, but I’ve had about four to six weeks off now since the Midleton game in the semi-finals of the club so I’m itching to get back.” The Cork players weren’t agitating to get rid of former manager Pat Ryan, far from it, but recognise too that O’Connor is a safe pair of hands. “We would have been happy for Pat to stay on but to have someone of Ben’s calibre coming in is probably the next best thing,” said Connolly. “So I know we will be fine with Ben. I think a lot of the younger lads played under him on Cork under-20 teams. I didn’t, but I have only heard positive things about him.” Horgan’s departure has also created an opportunity for a new free-taker to emerge. Declan Dalton shared the duties this year though Connolly is also an option. “I take them with Blackrock, I’m comfortable taking them,” he said. “If I have to take them, I’ll take them, but that’s something we’ll think about in a few months’ time.” If Connolly really does aspire to step into Horgan’s shoes, he will need to chase vital consistency. The 3-1 he scored against Tipperary in the Munster Championship last year was followed by two scoreless games in which he was substituted. And, by Connolly’s standards, his performances in the 2024 and 2025 All-Ireland finals failed to hit the highs of which he is capable. But it’s all part of the learning curve for a player who wasn’t always sure his senior career would pan out. “Yeah, of course,” he agreed. “It was obviously tough because I got surgery on my shoulder and then when I came back, I did a grade-four tear on my hamstring.” There was also an ankle issue which took a chunk out of his 2025 league campaign. “I had a kind of bursitis, or tendinitis, in my ankle,” he said. “It kind of flared up. It just needed a few weeks off.” The road to iconic status is rarely straightforward. Just ask Horgan, who was dropped in 2022, the same season Connolly made his full championship debut. Horgan never got his All-Ireland medal in the end, but Connolly has time on his side and has already started processing the lessons from this year’s final defeat to Tipperary. “I’ve watched it back personally, yeah,” he said of the decider, where Cork let a six-point half-time lead end in a 15-point defeat. “It’s a hard watch all right, but it has to be done.” He doesn’t agree that Tipp outfoxed them by deploying a sweeper, stifling an attack that had struck 7-26 against Dublin in the semi-final. “We kind of had an idea they would play with a sweeper,” said Connolly. “I don’t think it was tactically that they won, it was more that they wanted it more. They were relentless in their tackling, they just went after us.” *Alan Connolly was speaking to promote Blackrock Hurling Club’s car raffle fundraiser in association with Cogans Toyota.

Title: German Energy Professor: COP 30 Is A Failure…”Only Europe Remains Committed”

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change From the NoTricksZone By P Gosselin By Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt (in latest newsletter) Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt, image: X. Cooling trend continues The global temperature did not change in October compared to August. The cooling trend remains intact. The American National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) foresees a cool LA NINA developing in the Pacific this winter, which will lead to a further decline in global temperatures as well. Belém – All that fuss for nothing The 30th World Climate Conference in Belém is not yet over, but it is already becoming apparent that the event, announced as the “Conference of Truth,” will go down in the history of climate conferences as a turning point. No head of state from the four largest CO2-emitting nations—China (33%), the USA (12%), India (8%), and Russia (5%)—is showing up in Belém. Even before the conference, the New York Times headlined: “The whole world is fed up with climate policy.” And the fact that Bill Gates, one of the biggest supporters and sponsors of climate policy, explicitly warned against excessive, shortsighted climate policy just 14 days before the conference, and put prosperity back in focus — a major blow. Glenn Beck, a prominent American television host, explains the change of heart by Bill Gates: “It’s not about science, it’s about Trump.” Expressed differently: it’s not about conviction; it’s about damage control for his own company, which is planning multibillion-dollar investments in data centers in the USA and globally. And given the situation, these will have to rely on electricity from new gas-fired power plants in the short term, as the reactivation of old nuclear power plants will not suffice, and the construction of new nuclear power plants will still take several years in the USA. Only 1/3 of the states actually submit a plan For the Climate Conference in Belém, states had to report on their future plans for the use of coal, oil, and gas. The fact that only one-third even submitted a statement already hints at the dissolving importance of the climate issue in most nations around the world. But the reports that were submitted are revealing. Most states reported continuously increasing use of coal, oil, and gas. The reports show an increase in global coal usage by 30%, oil by 25%, and gas by 40% by 2030 compared to 2015. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) hoped to reduce global CO2 emissions by 45% by 2030 compared to 2015; now they are continuing to rise. Only Europe onboard Only Europe remains unshakably committed to the goal of achieving Net Zero CO2 emissions by 2050. Germany, the industrial heart of Europe, is even more ambitious and, according to Axel Bojanowski, is “the ‘leader’ among industrialized countries: It aims to be climate-neutral by 2045 – a self-destructive plan: Germany’s reduction will inevitably be compensated by rising emissions in other EU countries. This is because the European Emissions Trading System ensures that emission allowances not used in Germany are consumed in other EU countries. It is becoming increasingly clear what the Wall Street Journal meant when it called Germany’s energy policy the ‘dumbest in the world.’ A few days before the conference, the European states agreed on a common goal, namely to achieve a 90% CO2 reduction by 2040 compared to 1990. 5% of the self-commitment could come from emission reductions abroad, which, of course, must also be expensively paid for. The German Minister for the Environment celebrated this agreement as “good news for the German economy, as everyone would now have the same competitive conditions.” This statement reveals how little the German federal government and its ministers understand about the global economy. As if German industry only exports goods to European countries. German goods, however, compete in a global market that does not have the burdens of CO2 taxes and high energy prices on German products and can therefore always offer them more cheaply. 50% of exports go to countries outside the EU. Chancellor Merz and his Environment Minister Schneider are blatantly downplaying the German situation. Germany has set self-imposed shackles with the Climate Protection Act that will become highly painful in the coming years. German climate policy: “script for an economic catastrophe” Welt journalist Axel Bojanowski: “The German Climate Protection Act, cemented by the Federal Constitutional Court, seems to be a script for an economic catastrophe. It only allows Germany a remaining budget of 6.7 gigatonnes of CO2, which is likely to be used up by the early 2030s. According to the law, penalties, shutdowns, and restrictions on freedom are then threatened to meet the climate goals.” 6.7 gigatonnes was the remaining permissible budget after the ruling of the Federal Constitutional Court from 2020 onwards. As of today, only 3.6 gigatonnes of this remain. The buffer is reduced by about 0.5 gigatonnes each year. By 2032 at the latest, the remaining budget will be exhausted, and Germany will have reached the end of the line set by the Federal Constitutional Court. This will happen in the next legislative period, not just in 2040. Chancellor Merz whitewashes And in his 5-minute speech in Belém before a half-empty hall, Chancellor Merz spreads negligent whitewashing: “The economy is not the problem. Our economy is the key to protecting our climate even better.” Does the Chancellor not know the perilous state our industry is in? Scandal surrounds tropical forest Ffund (TFF) Probably the only outcome of the Belém conference will be the establishment of an investment fund, proposed by Brazilian President Lula, to finance the protection of tropical forests. The fund works as follows: Donor countries pay $25 billion into the fund. Private investors (investment funds) are supposed to pay in $100 billion. The donor countries receive a return of about 4.0-4.8%, which corresponds to the return on their government bonds, as they generally have to raise the money through government debt. The return for private investors is 5.8% to 7.2%. The fund’s money is invested in emerging market government bonds, which yield comparatively high interest due to the higher risk (Brazilian government bonds are currently at 12.25%). Private investors are served first, followed by the donor countries. If anything remains after the distribution of profits to private investors and donor countries, the amount is paid out to 74 countries with tropical forests. It is hoped that this way, $3-4 billion will be distributed annually to the tropical forest countries. The catch is this: To entice investors, private investors are given preference in the payment sequence: first the private ones, then the donor states. Furthermore, the donor countries must insure the fund against default. A default by an emerging market could quickly lead to the fund’s insolvency. In that case, the taxpayers of the donor countries would be held liable and, in an extreme scenario, lose their capital. Disadvantageous for the German taxpayer In preparation for Belém, there was fundamental disagreement over Germany’s participation in the fund between the Ministry of Finance and the Chancellor’s Office. The Chancellor’s Office clearly advocated for participation and a contribution of at least $1 billion. It was assisted by the Ministry for the Environment under Minister Schneider and the Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development under Minister Alabali-Radovan. The Ministry of Finance, under Lars Klingbeil, strongly objected, viewing the fund as a billion-dollar risk and doubting the viability of the fund’s structure. And indeed, the model is structurally disadvantageous for the German taxpayer. One could also say: We are subsidizing the returns of private investors with public money and providing the default guarantee for BlackRock and Co. That is why the Federal Ministry of Finance is persistently blocking Germany’s participation in the fund. It can be unequivocally stated that the Federal Ministry of Finance has thus far bravely defended the interests of the German taxpayer against the interests of BlackRock and Co. This is the background to Chancellor Merz being unable to name a figure (“a noteworthy amount”) in Belém. The billion € or $ is now supposed to be found in the budget reconciliation for the 2026 federal budget, which is taking place this week, so that the federal budget can be adopted on November 28. It is to be expected that the SPD will concede. But it could be a Pyrrhic victory for Chancellor Merz, who would then visibly be prioritizing the interests of international financial investors, especially if the fund were to run into difficulties. Whether the fund will ultimately materialize is still questionable, as it only comes into effect if the donor states commit to $10 billion. So far (excluding Germany), $5.6 billion has been raised. The USA and the UK have already declined. If the fund comes into being, the investment companies will profit first, with high returns secured by states, and then the emerging markets, which can sell their high-risk government bonds. Whether the tropical forest will benefit in this confusing financial jungle is not yet certain. The biggest risk remains with the donor countries, who are putting their taxpayers’ money at risk with the catchy story of saving the rainforest.” Subscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email. Type your email… Subscribe Realisation emerges…EVENTUALLY It ought to some day cease to amaze me what lengths these clowns go to to simulate, poorly, real free markets, piling ineptitude on top of corruption. I wonder how many of Lula’s friends are going to profit from all this nonsense. The poor taxpayers sure won’t. That’s the second place wonder, that voters are still voting in these clowns. “that voters are still voting in these clowns.” I don’t think those voters would vote for those clowns if they were told the truth about those clowns. Unfortunately, the Propaganda News Media distorts the truth about those clowns and make them appear to be fine candidates for election to office. The problem is the voters don’t get the truth and end up believing something that isn’t true, and then base their decisions on that. Propaganda News Media are a great danger to the freedoms of all of us, including the freedoms of the people they fool into voting for the wrong people. Europe has made enormous investments in wind/solar/battery infrastructure, which is not making any money, or losing money, or retrenching. Europe was planning to screw the US with high energy prices per kWh by using European designed, built, erected, owned and operated wind, solar and battery systems to maintain its competitive trade advantage for decades more. Trump prevented that plan and imposed tariffs to offset Europe’s numerous, intricate, non-tariff barriers. “or losing money, or retrenching.” For clarity: “or is losing money, or is retrenching” lol right, you are Netzero macht frei. I recall an old saying, “Reality is a bitch.” Just when you think government can’t get any worse here comes more stupid government. What a bunch of knuckleheads! The global temperature did not change in October compared to August. The cooling trend remains intact. Was it Bellman, or The Last Nail in the Head who said the IPCC say there has been no natural variation, so what on Earth is causing the down-turn in temperatures? It should be going UP!! 🙁 Temperature will continue down trend until 2029. The solar activity is declining and the Z-axis excursion hits a minimum in 2029 but still north of Earth’s elliptic. Temperature will then climb to mid 2030s with rising solar activity and new northern maximum excursion of the orbit mid 2030s similar to 2023. Then a reasonably rapid decline to a southern minimum in 2040 similar to the minimum of 1980. If climate models used solar intensity at latitudes for seasons, they would be able to show natural variation but they don’t so are useless for showing natural variation. It’s been cooling for almost two years now. Maybe CO2 has suddenly stopped going into the atmosphere? The latest peak was due to a volcanic explosion and a medium-strength El Niño almost coinciding in their effects. The cows have stopped farting, because they don’t want corks in their butts. Our man in Belem is leading by example- flying in and out twice. 24,000 miles. Yeah, this is the complete idiot who says “homegrown energy independence and security,” when the UK produces not one tonne of the metals and minerals required for the construction of ALL renewable equipment, batteries, and for a 3-fold extension of the grid – NOT 1 TONNE. He idiotically fails to realise that we totally relinquish energy independence and security to the Chinese by continuing with this renewable nonsense – the Chinese totally control the supply of the refined global production of those very metals and minerals. What a complete and utter idiot. Where mad Ed is concerned I have run out of negative superlatives. Latest figures from the ONS show GDP grew by just 0.1% in July to September, slower than economists’ expected 0.2%. Unemployment shoots up Here comes that budget … Deindustrialising the economy part II. “What a complete and utter idiot.” Ed Miliband is not a complete idiot. ﻿ Some parts are still missing … but he’s working on that. Such as his brain You win! He has a running sore and forgot his diaper. He will be gone soon. IS a running sore. It only allows Germany a remaining budget of 6.7 gigatonnes of CO2, which is likely to be used up by the early 2030s. This is farcical thinking. It will not be used up. Germany is in economic decline and full de-industrialisation mode. They can just buy stuff from China like everyone else. The one advantage of the decline is that it will slow immigration. Africa will be considerably more attractive than Germany within a decade. So what happens when Germany has used up it’s carbon budget? Do they have to switch everything off? With no economy they won’t be able to afford to buy anything from abroad. Good luck to Germany, you’ll need it. No – Germans will start killing their politicians , like everywhere in Europe. Then the assassination attempts that as of now only targeted populist leaders Gladio 3.0 style, will be more grassroot style,have a logical motivation and target the WEF – Blackrock assets. Until then it’ll be interesting to see how they’ll switch towards a war economy (Russia) and increase weapon production while everything else is in decline. First, Germany destroys itself with Naziism. Now it is in the process of shooting itself in the foot with these Net Zero and green energy religions. If there something about Germans that causes them to do things like this to themselves twice in a century? Is it something in their culture or is it the way they think or are raised? Do they (And the British?) look at the alarmist and other scientists as authority figures that command the same respect as royalty on a continent with a history of royalty? Yes, we had climate alarmism take hold here in the U.S. as well. But, as noted elsewhere, it appears to be dying out here as opposed to Europe where is seems to persist. Maybe its just the leadership we all put in office during elections. Just a lot of speculation on my part for whatever it is worth. “Maybe its just the leadership we all put in office during elections.” It is definitely the leadership we elect. The United States would be going down the same “Road to Ruin” as the Germans and the UK, if a Democrat had been elected president of the U.S. The Natives are restless in Europe. Maybe, if there are enough of them, they can change directions, away from the current ruinous energy policy. Otherwise, their economies will crash and burn, and then the voters will change direction. Let’s hope it doesn’t come to that, and they wake up to reality before that happens. “First, Germany destroys itself with Naziism. Now it is in the process of shooting itself in the foot with these Net Zero and green energy religions.” NetZism At some point, someone will notice that world levels of atmospheric CO2 have not stopped rising. After that, they will also notice that the rate of rise continues to accelerate as well. It’s hard to point to your policy achievements when there aren’t any. Only Europe remains unshakably committed to the goal of achieving Net Zero CO2 emissions by 2050. That isn’t quite true. China remains unshakably committed to the goal of everyone else achieving Net Zero by 2050. Yes, to China, Net Zero for everyone else is a huge success! From the article: “It is becoming increasingly clear what the Wall Street Journal meant when it called Germany’s energy policy the ‘dumbest in the world.’” Truer words were never spoken. No country in the world has a dumber energy policy than Germany. The UK’s energy policy is equally dumb, and they are right behind Germany in the race to destroy their economies with insane energy policies. What is it? Are European politicians particularly gullible to climate change propaganda? “German Energy Professor: COP 30 Is A Failure…”Only Europe Remains Committed”” Germany has it figured out. Copilot AI tells us, “Approximately 90% of Porsche vehicles are sold outside of Germany.” The net zero thing is pointless. There is no real evidence that CO2 has any effect on our global glimate system. The AGW hypothesis has been falsified by science. Spending money to fight climate change is just a big waste of funds. Funny. There is no “global climate system.” There may be a global energy system that includes the dozens of micro climates with coupled land, sea, and air energy transport systems. How can the Sahara desert be the same climate as the rain forests the same climate as Antarctica? We must embrace scientific definitions and stop using common language, context driven, vocabulary. Likewise the definition of climate is statistics. The definition of climate change (at whatever level) is statistics. It is extreme hubris to say that humans can control weather, globally or locally. Do humans affect the plane?. Yes. Are there problems? Yes. But must we destroy civilization to save the planet? Not only no, but hell no. Correction: (typo) Do Humans affect the planet? Thanks for that, but remember… we do not appreciate Common Sense. We are not programmed to respond in that area… EU remains committed to suicide. Without the collection plate they’ve given up fighting climate change and are now busy fighting all their so called disinformation and misinformation in order to save their butts- ‘COP of truth’: Countries commit to tackling climate disinformation at UN climate summit They’ve run out of taxes and with red ink everywhere printing more money goes straight into inflation post Covid. To make things worse they’ve hit the wall with fickles penetration with the exponential cost of moving it around over space and time. You pluck the early low hanging fruit with solar and wind in the best areas close to existing infrastructure and it’s all uphill from there. Germany is wholehog solar panel, wind mills,and Russian LNG. The country is flooded with illegal aliens. and China is their biggest customer. The government of Germany has committed to doubling his defense budget. It’s only a matter of time before Germany. Economy has a freefall. I am not sure China is a customer. Supplier, perhaps? and Calif – $8-$9 gas may be the end of Newsome The cartels will figure out how smuggle into CA Mexican gas that they steal by hijacking tanker trucks. Maybe they could put pipes into all those drug tunnels they keep digging. Reminds me of a gas war movie. Can’t recall the title. Do folks still smoke pipes for drugs? DOJ may soon be ‘investigating’ Neuscom. As I like to say, it’s a thin line between being committed, and ought to be committed. More socialist “finance” ministers who lack an even basic understanding of finance. “emerging market government bonds, which yield comparatively high interest due to the higher risk” When aggregated together, government, private and emerging markets all return pretty much the same over all rate of return. First world government bonds return low rates, but very few of them ever fail to pay out. Private funds pay a higher rate of return, but a higher percentage of them go belly up. Emerging market government bonds pay even more, but a still higher percentage of them will go bankrupt before paying out. This fund seems to be predicated on the belief that all three types of funds will be equally safe. The reality is that it’s a poorly disguised scheme to transfer first world government and private investor funds to 3rd world kleptocracies with probably a non-trivial amount being fed back to certain first world finance ministers under the table. The fact that the private investors are also being indemnified against loss is a further indicator that payoffs are being made. “to arrange the transfer of more funds to Blackrock et al.” VW reluctantly closed its plant in the forced labor part of western China. But Germany and the EU are still committed to the forced labor supply chain from there. They have experience with that from the 1930s and 40s, in addition to colonialism. It is time to abandon the climate change narrative and its consequence: the energy transition. FIFTY (50) years of effort to convince the world of a non-happening so that several hundred $trillion can be wasted on “green” energy is coming to its natural end – bankruptcy. Lysenkoism failed and anthropogenic climate change has failed. Nature responds to truth, not fiction. “Germany….. is “the ‘leader’ among industrialized countries.” Not for long though. Soon Germany won’t be ‘industrialized’. Climate Protection Act that will become highly painful in the coming years. – ugh – the WSJ reports that electricity in Germany is now considered to be a luxury and not affordable by many Germans who have resorted to felling timber for heat and cooking – now that’s green progress? seems that the coming years have arrived Is Europe really all that committed? King of Sweden questions the cost of CO2 net zero: Swedish monarch King Carl XVI Gustaf, well-known for his lifelong environmental engagement, landed in a bit of hot water at COP30, the United Nations Climate Change Conference, in Belém, Brazil, by questioning how much of the world’s climate challenges Europe is supposed to take financial responsibility for. In an interview with Swedish state broadcaster Sveriges Radio, the monarch said he doesn’t believe the conference will be able to come to an agreement. “We all have to take our own responsibilities and try to do the best we can,” he said, pointing out that Europe is already taking significant steps to limit CO2 emissions.

But the rest of the world is much, much worse.” https://europeanconservative.com/articles/news/king-of-sweden-at-cop30-how-much-are-we-supposed-to-pay/ This comment from professor Verenholt would not be the first time that a German bureaucrat pretended to speek for the whole of Europe. From the above article: “Only Europe remains unshakably committed to the goal of achieving Net Zero CO2 emissions by 2050.” Today, the European Union emits a total of a little more than 6% of the world’s annual CO2 emissions (see https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions ). So, keep the faith and virtue signaling EU, you are making a difference, albeit insignificant since the atmosphere is shared with all nations around the world. I can confidently state that Net Zero will NEVER be achieved globally. World-wide Net Zero is a Pipe Dream. Too many politicians on the ‘pipe’, it seems. I have a hard time believing that Germany is committing economic suicide faster than Canada but I guess it’s possible. Just like Germany, over half the population is too stupid to see what is coming. Take it from the German Treasury. These EUpeons need to be slapped silly to get them to stop strangling their citizens with suicidal beliefs. Get out of the EU.

Title: Circle plans native token for Arc blockchain as Q3 profit surges

The stablecoin issuer considered stablecoin-denominated gas fees on Arc, but has a long-term goal of shifting to distributed governance. Stablecoin issuer Circle, the company behind the USDC dollar-pegged stablecoin, is planning a native token for its ARC layer-1 blockchain testnet, an enterprise-focused Ethereum Virtual Machine network. Circle launched the Arc testnet in October, with participation from investment bank Goldman Sachs, asset manager BlackRock, credit card company Visa and over 100 other companies. The company, which disclosed plans for the new token alongside its earnings on Wednesday, initially planned to center gas fees on the Arc network around USDC (USDC) and other stablecoins. According to a statement, Circle’s long-term goal is to pivot Arc to a decentralized governance model of geographically distributed validators: Cointelegraph reached out to Circle but had not received a response at time of publication. Related: Circle’s Arc attracts South Korea’s first won-backed stablecoin experiment The company also disclosed its financial results for the third quarter of 2025, reporting revenue of $740 million, a 66% year-over-year increase. Circle reported net income of $214 million in Q3, representing a 202% gain over the period. However, costs also rose, with distribution and transaction costs rising by 74% compared with 2024, totaling $448 million in the last quarter. Additionally, operating costs rose by 70% in Q3, reaching $211 million, which the company attributed to a 14% increase in its workforce and higher compensation costs for employees. Circle’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), a critical metric for publicly-traded stocks, increased by 78% year-over-year, totaling $166 million for the quarter. The launch of the Arc network highlights the growing institutional involvement in crypto and the shift toward application-specific blockchain networks tailored for specific use cases, platforms, and digital assets. Developers turning to application-specific blockchain networks aim to circumvent the relatively low speed, scalability issues, and high fees associated with general-purpose blockchain networks that handle mixed traffic. Hyperliquid and Injective protocols are examples of applications built on app-specific layer-1 blockchain networks. However, critics argue that app-specific blockchains fragment liquidity, are prone to hacking due to centralization, and lack the community support that is a feature of general-purpose blockchain networks with distributed governance.“Appchains also grossly underestimate the cost of infrastructure and compliance: explorers, custody, exchanges, oracles, bridges, toolkits, integrated development environments, on/off ramps, native issuance and integration, and regulatory compliance,” Andre Cronje, co-founder of Sonic Labs, said. Marc Boiron, CEO of Polygon Labs, the lead development team for the Polygon layer-2 blockchain network, disagreed with Cronje, arguing that more robust interoperability between blockchain networks is already happening and will solve these issues.Magazine: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in the stablecoin fight Cointelegraph is committed to providing independent, high-quality journalism across the crypto, blockchain, AI, fintech, and gaming industries.

Title: Bitcoin – Why the $524M BTC rush is latest threat to ETH’s rally

Is this the comeback signal institutions were waiting for? Alt HD: Spot Bitcoin ETFs see $524 million surge – Are institutions quietly accumulating BTC again? BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) topped the list with $224.2 million in inflows, followed by Fidelity’s and Ark Invest’s ETFs. Despite strong ETF inflows, Bitcoin slightly dipped 0.31%, trading around $104,772.57 at press time. After a turbulent start to November marked by steady outflows, Spot Bitcoin [BTC] ETFs made a strong comeback on 11th November, recording a massive $524 million in inflows, according to data from Farside Investors. There was a big increase in investments in Bitcoin recently, the largest in weeks. This suggests that investors might be feeling more positive about Bitcoin’s future after some uncertainty in the market. Among the Spot Bitcoin ETFs, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) led the surge with a remarkable $224.2 million in inflows. It was followed by Fidelity’s FBTC, which attracted $165.9 million, and Ark Invest’s ARKB, which saw inflows of $102.5 million. Meanwhile, Grayscale’s GBTC recorded $24.1 million, and Bitwise’s BITB brought in $7.3 million. The remaining Bitcoin ETFs, however, registered zero flows during the same period. Source: Carl Moon/X The timing of these inflows was particularly notable, as BTC was trading around $105,000 on the day of the surge. At the time of writing, BTC had slightly retreated to $104,772.57, marking a 0.31% decline in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. Despite the minor dip, the strong inflows into Bitcoin ETFs reflect renewed investor confidence and continued institutional interest amid broader market volatility. In contrast, Spot Ethereum [ETH] ETFs faced a challenging day, recording total outflows worth $107.1 million. Grayscale’s ETHE led the downturn with $75.7 million in outflows, followed by BlackRock’s ETHA, which saw $19.8 million leave the fund. Other Ethereum-based ETFs also recorded modest outflows, while a few registered neutral activity with zero net flows. At press time, ETH was trading at $3,510.63, down 1.45% in the past 24 hours, signaling a brief cooling-off period after recent gains. On the other hand, Solana [SOL]-based Spot ETFs saw modest but positive traction. The two approved Solana ETFs, Bitwise’s BSOL and Grayscale’s GSOL, collectively recorded $8 million in inflows. Of this, GSOL contributed $5.9 million, while BSOL added $2.1 million. Meanwhile, SOL was trading at $159.25, reflecting a 2.41% decline over the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. These movements came amid a broader landscape where multiple altcoin ETFs remain pending approval, and major institutional players like BlackRock continue to exercise caution. Therefore, BlackRock’s cautious approach toward altcoin ETFs stems from its firm belief in Bitcoin and Ethereum as the only assets with lasting value.

Title: Easttree Media, BlackRock-Backed Investment Platform for TV, Film Income Rights, Launches at AFM (EXCLUSIVE)

By Alex Ritman A new investment company plans to take a leaf from the recent spate of musicians selling the rights to their own back catalogs and shift it into the film and TV space. Easttree Media, an investment platform acquiring income rights in some of what it claims are the “world’s most iconic films and television shows,” has announced its official launch at the American Film Market. Among it founders are two former execs from Hipgnosis, the ambitious management company that made headlines for splashing hundreds of millions of dollars on buying the rights to song catalogs from some of the world’s best known musicians. Related Stories Daniel Day-Lewis Says Brian Cox Dragged Him Into Method Actor Debate, Denies Claim That He Taught Jeremy Strong: 'I Don't Feel Responsible in Any Way' for How Strong Acts on Set Founded in the U.K., Easttree was backed by funds and accounts backed by U.S. investment management giant BlackRock in May of this year. Popular on Variety The company provides actors, writers, directors, producers and other rights holders — including production companies, studios and financiers — with what it says is the “ability to monetize all or part of their participation interests.” Focusing exclusively on passive profit participations in film and TV properties, it “enables sellers to monetise 100% of their income rights or pursue partial buyouts that create ongoing alignment and long-term revenue partnerships.” Easttree — which has already completed multiple transactions involving some of the world’s most prolific shows and artists — was founded in 2024 by Marc Allen, Chris Helm, and Markku Lonnqvist. Allen brings expertise from the film and TV entertainment space, having previously served as COO of the management and production company 42. Helm previously served as CFO Hipgnosis Songs Funds overseeing acquisitions of music catalogues. Lonnqvist most recently served as the Chief Investment Officer at Hipgnosis Song Management and was previously a partner at Pamplona Capital Management. “I’m proud to have created this business with our team and BlackRock,” said Allen. “Being able to provide such a service for such a broad range of talent, as well as sophisticated, high value solutions for the world’s largest film and TV entertainment industry players gives us a unique opportunity to work with creators, producers and platforms across the whole film and TV spectrum regardless of scale.” Added Helm: “Our vision is to approach film and TV participations through a fresh lens — bringing transparency, alignment and partnerships that serve talent. We’re firm believers that acquirors of music rights can scale, succeed commercially and still advocate for artists. We are bringing that same conviction to film and television, turning these income rights into a transformative new asset class.” Paul Braude, head of the direct private opportunities group at BlackRock, said: “We are pleased to collaborate with Easttree Media on their journey. Iconic film and television titles continue to attract audiences well beyond their initial release, and we believe these assets provide our clients with even greater choice to meet their investment needs alongside access to distinctive and durable source of returns.” Hipgnosis — which launched in 2018 — went on a spree of acquisitions between 2021 and 2023, acquiring the catalogs of artists including Neil Young, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Justin Bieber, Shakira and many more. It helped drive the price of music catalogs to new heights, but grew overextended and eventually sold to Blackstone in 2024 for $1.6 billion.

Title: Trump snubs BofA CEO Brian Moynihan in White House dinner for Wall Street execs: sources

President Trump appears to have snubbed Bank of America boss Brian Moynihan as he hosts a White House dinner with top Wall Street executives on Wednesday — signaling a persistent rift between the pair over the “debanking” of the president following the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, The Post has learned. Moynihan, CEO of the nation’s second-biggest bank, failed to score an invite to the Wednesday dinner — even as JPMorgan Chase chief Jamie Dimon received an invite and is expected to attend, according to sources. Other CEOs slated to attend include Nasdaq’s Adena Friedman, Larry Fink of Blackrock, Ted Pick of Morgan Stanley and David Solomon of Goldman Sachs. Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser was invited but won’t be able to attend, according to a source close to the situation. Fraser is believed to be in Trump’s good graces following a report last month that she secured a deal to begin managing Trump’s money. Dimon’s invite comes despite the fact that JPMorgan disclosed last week that it’s being probed over allegations it denied banking services to conservatives. Dimon, however, is known as a political moderate who has maintained a close relationship with Trump, who has often floated his name as a possible Treasury secretary. As for the BofA boss, “Trump has no great love for Moynihan,” according to a CEO who is slated to attend the Wednesday dinner. A White House spokesman declined to comment, as did a Bank of America spokesman. “We don’t take this as a snub,” a source close to Moynihan told The Post. “Brian gets invited to enough dinners.” The person pointed to a state dinner for Trump at Windsor Castle where Moynihan was in attendance and other top CEOs weren’t. But that dinner was hosted by King Charles III, not the White House. On Wednesday, Moynihan told Fox News he wants to meet with New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani to discuss the city’s future as competing states try to court concerned business owners away from the Big Apple. Trump has lashed out publicly against the BofA boss — on at least two occasions. The first was in January during a virtual Q&A session with the BofA CEO sitting on stage in Davos, Switzerland. In a TV interview this summer, Trump claimed BofA was among the banks that denied the Trump Organization services following his first term. Big banks like BofA and JPMorgan Chase blamed pressure from the nascent Biden administration to deny services to various right-leaning businesses and individuals including Trump. The specific reason for Trump and his family business concerned his involvement in the January 6 Capital Hill melee and the controversy surrounding it. Moynihan is considered one of Wall Street’s most progressive CEOs on various cultural issues, including employment practices like diversity, equity and inclusion as well as environmental social governance investing.

Never miss a story. Another issue for Moynihan has been his involvement in the culture wars that have swept academia pitting some of the most prestigious colleges against a White House determined to remove left-wing bias from campuses. He was chancellor of the corporation of Brown University when the notoriously left-leaning college voted on divesting its massive endowment from companies that do business with Israel, which leftists deemed an apartheid state committing genocide over its military response to the Oct. 7 murder of innocent Israelis by Hamas terrorists. The vote ultimately failed in its so-called corporation, the governing body of the university. Advertisement

Title: Donald Trump set to host Wall Street CEOs including Jamie Dimon for swanky White House dinner

President Trump is set to roll out the red carpet for Wall Street bigwigs, including JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon and Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, at a White House dinner on Wednesday evening, sources told The Post. Two insiders, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, Nasdaq chief Adena Friedman, and Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick would also join the commander-in-chief tonight in Washington, D.C. News of the dinner, which is being seen as an attempt by Trump to drum up support for his economic agenda from America’s top business leaders, was first reported by CBS News. The president’s public schedule shows that a dinner will take place in the White House’s state dining room at 7:30 p.m. ET. The Post has approached the White House for comment. It comes after increased scrutiny of this administration’s handling of economic issues and consumer costs, after hard-left Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani won the New York mayoral race by focusing on the spiralling cost of living in the Big Apple. The real estate mogul won backing from corporate America during his 2024 campaign by pledging to slash taxes and red tape, although his move to slap hefty tariffs on imported goods has disrupted Uncle Sam’s trade flows and disrupted markets worldwide. JPMorgan’s Dimon also warned Trump of the dangers of undermining Fed Reserve chair Jerome Powell, who came under fire after The Post broke the news of his $2.5 billion renovation of the central bank’s downtown DC HQ, prompting uproar among Republicans in Congress. This newspaper also exclusively reported that the Trump campaign’s top staff had used the 69-year-old veteran chief executive as a “sounding board” for shaping their economic policies before the president’s crushing electoral win over Kamala Harris in November last year. Trump and Dimon met for the first time in years when they held talks at the Oval Office in July to discuss economic and regulatory policies. In September, the president hosted a similar dinner for technology leaders, including Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg and Apple’s Tim Cook, where the corporate titan committed to expanding domestic investments, especially in artificial intelligence, an area prioritized by the administration.

Firms will pay out money in fiat USD, and recipients will receive the money in dollar-pegged stablecoins like Circle’s USDC, the world’s second largest stablecoin by capitalization. It doesn’t appear that companies will be able to send stablecoins directly via the scheme. Visa did not mention if or when support for stablecoins other than USDC would be added, though it didn't say the service would be exclusive to USDC. Anyone who wants to use the service to receive payments will need both a stablecoin wallet and to pass customary AML/KYC checks, and the pilot is currently limited to platforms and businesses based in the U.S. Visa earmarked the service as being useful for the creator and gig economy. For example, firms like TikTok or YouTube, which deliver small, irregular payments to millions of people globally, though no participants were announced. Visa says it is in the process of onboarding partners, with wider access projected for some point in the second half of 2026, depending on local regulations. The pilot comes as part of Visa Direct, the payment giant’s service that allows users to conduct payments using its own payment rails rather than, for example, those of two banks. The payments giant also didn’t confirm what payment rails the service might use, but it’s been linking up with Circle on stablecoin infrastructure as of late. In late October, Circle announced that Visa was among the firms participating in its new public testnet for Arc, its Layer-1 blockchain network, alongside companies such as BlackRock and Goldman Sachs. Visa has made a series of increasingly bullish moves in the stablecoin space during 2025. In May, it poured an unspecified amount into London-based stablecoin infrastructure company BVNK as a “strategic investment” via its Visa Ventures arm. Earlier this month, Visa issued a report predicting an increased role for stablecoins in the $40 trillion global credit market, saying that stablecoin-based lending could allow traditional institutions to bring parts of that market onto programmable, blockchain-based rails. Meanwhile, like rival Mastercard, Visa has been adding support for stablecoin-based crypto credit cards—including with fintech Rain in the U.S., and Bridge, a unit of payments giant Stripe, in Latin America.

The blockchain infrastructure is designed to support institutional-grade digital asset applications. The company stated it is exploring the possibility of launching a native token on the Arc Network, though no specifics about token utility, economics, or timeline were provided in the earnings announcement.

Circle’s Q3 results reflect the company’s position in the digital asset infrastructure sector as regulatory frameworks for stablecoins continue to develop in major markets.

Title: Ethereum Is ‘Infrastructure for Wall Street.’ Could $PEPENODE Be the Next Beneficiary?
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-infrastructure-wall-street-pepenode-explode-next/
Time Published: 2025-11-12T14:34:52Z

Quick Facts: Ethereum’s ($ETH) reputation as crypto’s settlement layer just got a major institutional stamp. Former BlackRock executive Joseph Chalom argued that Ethereum isn’t merely another blockchain; it’s the ‘infrastructure’ Wall Street can actually build on in an interview with CoinDesk. His case rests on the three things TradFi will not compromise on: liquidity, security, and trust that lets compliance teams sleep at night. And Chalom is putting his thoughts into action over at SharpLink. The staking of billions of dollars’ worth of Ether validates $ETH’s role as the foundational layer for the future of finance. That framing hits differently in late 2025, especially if you believe what BlackRock CEO Larry Fink thinks of tokenization being the next generation for markets, something he has touted since 2022. For traders watching risk rotations, that institutional endorsement often kick-starts a familiar second-order trade: attention and flows migrate toward $ETH-aligned narratives and apps that feel built for scale, such as PEPENODE ($PEPENODE). PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) is a project aiming to build an Ethereum-based ‘mine-to-earn’ ecosystem with a gamified staking model. In a market hunting for a solid premise tied to real utility, a memecoin that anchors incentives to Ethereum’s trust layer is sure to attract investors. Overall, its pitch is simple: take the dopamine of mining, strip out the hardware, and plug it into Ethereum’s security and tooling. You’ll start off with an empty virtual server room. From here, you’ll be able to buy your first node, which you can then combine with other nodes, which helps boost your mining output. Rather than combining nodes at random, you’ll need to have a bit of strategy. That’s because a certain combination of these nodes will have an impact on your performance. Get it right and you’ll get a higher yield. You’ll have a dashboard where you can track your progress, including your hashrate, energy, and rewards. All in all, you’ll get a taste of crypto mining without building and maintaining an expensive rig all by yourself. After the TGE, staking, node utility, and a leaderboard system will also go live. As a participant, you’ll be encouraged to continue optimizing your setup, as doing so helps you generate more coins, including exclusive $PEPENODE boosts and some of the best meme coins like Pepe and Fartcoin. While none of this guarantees price performance, the mix of gamified progression, measurable on-chain actions, and $ETH’s credibility gives PEPENODE a shot at stronger retention than the average meme coin. Due to these factors, we believe the token has the potential to reach a high of $0.0072 by the end of 2026, a 528.6% increase according to our PEPENODE price prediction. At the moment, the PEPENODE presale continues to gain traction, having raised over $2.12M to date. You can still buy its native $PEPENODE tokens for $0.0011454 each, which you can claim after the presale or stake to earn 609% APY. When staking, it’s worth noting that the rewards rate will change as more tokens are added to the staking pool. As with most token presales, PEPENODE features regular price increases. Because of this, the rule of thumb is to always act as quickly as possible so you can lock in tokens at the best possible price at the moment. There are two days left before the next price increase in this ongoing presale, so hurry. Join the PEPENODE presale today.

Stock futures are higher this morning after the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a record high on Tuesday; the House of Representatives is poised to vote on legislation to end the six-week U.S. government shutdown; Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares are rising after the chipmaker projected strong revenue growth over the coming years; the White House is reportedly examining measures that could limit the influence of proxy advisers and index-fund managers in shareholder voting; and shares of On Holding are soaring after the sneaker maker posted strong earnings and raised its guidance. Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are moving higher as investors keep close tabs on developments in Washington D.C., with a key vote scheduled later today that could end government shutdown. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were up 0.2% recently after the blue-chip index closed at a record high on Tuesday. Futures tied to the benchmark S&P 500 index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq were up 0.4% and 0.6%, respectively. Bitcoin was at just under $105,000, up from an overnight low of around $102,500. Gold futures rose 0.6% to $4,140 an ounce, trading near their highest levels in three weeks. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects borrowing costs on a wide array of consumer loans, was at 4.08%, down from the previous close of 4.11%. The House of Representatives is set to vote on a spending measure that would reopen the government through January and end the longest government shutdown in U.S. history. A key House committee moved the Senate-passed legislation forward in an early-Wednesday vote, rejecting attempts by some Democrats to amend the legislation. President Donald Trump is expected to sign the legislation, bringing an end to the shutdown, which is now in its 43rd day. The work stoppage has contributed to a freeze on U.S. government economic reports, while also creating staffing issues in the air traffic control system that prompted officials to reduce the number of flights. Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) jumped in premarket trading after CEO Lisa Su said the chipmaker’s revenue could grow by 35% annually over the next three-to-five years owing to continued strong demand for artificial intelligence chips. At the company’s first-ever analysts day on Tuesday, Su said that the company’s AI data center business could grow by 80% annually over the same period, potentially hitting tens of billions of dollars in sales by 2027. AMD also said its gross margins would come in at around 55% to 58% in coming years, ahead of analysts' forecasts. Shares of AMD, which have nearly doubled in value since the start of the year, were up 6% ahead of the bell. The White House is looking at new measures that would reduce the influence of proxy advisers and index-fund managers on shareholder voting, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal. The report said that Trump administration officials are considering executive orders that could ban proxy advisers such as Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis from making recommendations on shareholder votes. Officials are also looking to curtail the influence of index-fund managers such as BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, according to the report. The influence of proxy firms has been criticized by top corporate executives, including Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who faced resistance from proxy advisers ahead of a recent shareholder vote on his trillion-dollar pay package. Shares of On Holding (ONON) are soaring in premarket trading after the Roger Federer-backed Swiss sneaker maker reported better-than-expected third-quarter results and raised its full-year outlook. On posted adjusted earnings of 0.43 Swiss francs ($0.54) per share on net sales that jumped 25% year-over-year to 794.4 million Swiss francs ($994.2 million), well above Wall Street estimates. The Zurich-based company, which lifted its guidance for a third straight quarter, now expects full-year sales to grow by 34% on a constant-currency basis, up from a previous projection of at least 31%. Profitability is also expected to rise. On co-founder and executive co-chairman Caspar Coppetti told CNBC the company won't be offering Black Friday deals and will be "full price through the holiday season." On shares, which through yesterday's close had shed more than a third of their value this year, were up 8% in recent trading.

"Circle continued to see accelerating adoption of USDC and our platform in the third quarter as we build the new Economic OS for the internet,” said Circle Co-Founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire, in a press release. He pointed to the successful launch of the Arc public testnet in October, with participation from over 100 companies including BlackRock, Visa, Goldman Sachs, AWS, and crypto exchanges Coinbase and Kraken. In its statement, Circle noted that it is "exploring the possibility" of a native Arc token launch. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues was pegged at $708.92 million, based off of predictions from four different analysts. The consensus mark for earnings is currently pegged at 17 cents per share, revised upward by 5 cents over the past 30 days. The company made its debut on the NYSE in June. Since the company went public, USDC's market capitalization has climbed from $61 billion to nearly $76 billion at the time of writing, according to crypto price aggregator CoinGecko. Analysts are expecting the stablecoin issuer will see a total of $2.68 billion in revenue this year. But that optimism wasn't evident in the company's share price heading into Wednesday. The company reported early Wednesday morning, before the opening bell in New York. Circle, which trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the CRCL ticker, closed on Tuesday at $98.30 after having fallen 5.57% during the session. About an hour before the company's earnings report, shares had fallen further to $94.04 in pre-market trading. The company is coming off a mixed Q2 report, when it reported a 53% increase in year-over-year revenue and a net loss of $4.48 per share. It was around that time the company unveiled plans for its L1 blockchain, Arc. The blockchain is optimized for stablecoin-focused applications. Arc will use USDC for gas, features a built-in FX engine, and enables opt-in privacy.

Title: Crypto Tokenization Under Scrutiny: Global Regulators Cite Risks Amid Split Opinions

Time Published: 2025-11-12T11:00:58Z

Cryptocurrencies linked to real-world assets (RWAs) are drawing scrutiny, as the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) recently warned that these innovations might introduce new risks for investors. In a report released on Tuesday, the global securities regulator highlighted that while many risks associated with tokenization fall under existing regulatory frameworks, new vulnerabilities may arise from the technology itself. Tokenization—essentially the creation of blockchain-based tokens that represent real-world assets like stocks or bonds—has gained renewed interest throughout the year. New tokenized products are increasingly being marketed to the public via online brokers. Tuang Lee Lim, chair of IOSCO’s board-level fintech taskforce, noted that while adoption levels remain modest, tokenization could fundamentally transform the issuance, trading, and servicing of financial assets. However, the regulator’s report points that the diverse ways in which tokenized assets are structured could create confusion for investors, leaving them uncertain about whether they own the underlying asset or merely the crypto token. Additionally, the existence of third-party token issuers adds layers of counterparty risk, a concern echoed by the European Union’s (EU) securities regulator in a similar report from September. IOSCO also cautioned that this new “vulnerability” could be exacerbated by increasing connections to the broader crypto asset market. Despite these risks, some mainstream financial institutions, including Nasdaq, are moving forward with tokenization initiatives. Will Peck, head of digital assets at WisdomTree, remarked that tokenization offers an alternative method for holding assets like gold in a digital wallet, allowing for 24/7 trading and peer-to-peer (P2P) transfers. He added that such innovations could serve as collateral for loans, offering a protective hedge against the depreciation of the US dollar. However, concerns persist among other Wall Street players. Although there has been rising commercial interest in tokenization, the International Organization of Securities Commissions pointed out that actual adoption remains limited. Proponents of tokenized assets argue that blockchain technology can reduce trading costs, expedite settlement times, and attract a younger demographic of investors. However, IOSCO cautioned that the purported efficiency gains are “inconsistent,” as market participants still rely on traditional market infrastructure to facilitate trading, rather than fully replacing it with blockchain technology. The report criticized issuers for failing to publicly disclose any measurable gains. In the US, the push for tokenization has gained momentum alongside new legislation this year, which has spurred a surge in stablecoin adoption. The crypto industry, along with major Wall Street figures, is eager to mainstream this trend. Vlad Tenev, CEO of crypto trading platform Robinhood (HOOD), recently described tokenization as an unstoppable “freight train.” Meanwhile, Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, asserted in a summer newsletter that the concept of tokenization has the potential to revolutionize investing.

Title: ETF Launches Are Outpacing Closures. Can the Momentum Last?

Roughly the same number of ETFs closed in the first half of 2024 and 2025, even as new product launches pick up speed. Lilly Riddle lilly@thedailyupside.com What goes up, must come down. Or so it would seem. It’s no secret that ETF launches have exploded this year, with nearly 800 new funds hitting the market in the first nine months of 2025 alone, already ahead of last year’s total of 746. Asset flows have also climbed, with net year-to-date sales topping $1.1 trillion last month. On the other hand, closures have largely remained steady, with 266 funds shuttering in the first half of this year, compared with 253 in the first half of last year, according to ETFGI. But, experts said those numbers could rise as new products struggle to gain the assets needed to survive. “Am I concerned that there’s too many products coming out, and that some of them are going to close? Yes,” said Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF trends research at VettaFi. “BlackRock or any other asset manager is not closing a popular ETF because they have too many of them. They’re pulling inventory off the shelf that isn’t selling to make room for something more likely to sell.” Despite issuers launching funds left and right, there’s reason to believe that new assets can keep up, at least for now. Certain strategies are more popular than others, with areas like spot bitcoin having more success because of the sheer amount of investor interest, said Greg Stumm, president and CEO of American Beacon Advisors. “There are 11 of these [spot bitcoin ETFs], and I’d originally thought that by this time, you’d have seen half of them close. But even the smaller ones are $500 million dollars,” Stumm said. Still, spaces that aren’t the size of crypto will see closures. “If you’re running the same product as someone else, how are you going to see that delta?” Stumm added. According to ETFGI, closures have been roughly on par with prior years: Circle of Life: Although they can be an inconvenience for investors, closures are part of the natural rhythm of the ETF industry, Rosenbluth said. It’s more of an opportunity cost for issuers to run unpopular or unprofitable funds. “Marketing efforts, sales efforts, listing fees: There are costs to running an ETF,” he added. “If you’ve got something waiting in the wings … it’s prudent to take something off the shelf and put something new on.” About 900 ETFs launched this year, and dozens of highly leveraged and spot crypto products await approval. Not all of them will catch on. Fundstrat is back at the free throw line, this time with a small- and mid-cap ETF and another focused on income. Issuers are betting that advisors could benefit from exposure to a narrow slice of the aerospace defense industry. The company, which is planning to add mutual fund share classes to some of its ETFs, recently rebranded and put the State Street name on many ETFs while taking SPDR off of some. More than half of millennial ETF investors told Schwab that they can and will outperform boring old index funds. While far from the biggest ETFs on the market, spaced-themed funds are skyrocketing in 2025. ETF Upside sat down with Tuttle to discuss his approach to ETFs and what has him so interested in alien technology. ETFs that focus on clean energy investments in the US and globally have been outperforming the wider market this year, and by no small margin. The success of money market funds and their ETF counterparts has coincided with low interest rates and an uncertain macroeconomic environment. Net flows of ETFs reached yet another record last month, and actively managed products also captured more market share. The pace of ETF launches and fund conversions is picking up, but there is a challenge to find shelf space at broker-dealers. Nearly a dozen ex-China funds have launched since 2023. © 2025 The Daily Upside
