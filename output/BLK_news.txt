Title: Shipping Firms Pull Back from Hong Kong to Skirt US-China Risks

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Port Of Hong Kong Stock Photo: leungchopan / Shutterstock.com HONG KONG/LONDON, March 6 (Reuters) – Some shipping companies are discreetly moving operations out of Hong Kong and taking vessels off its flag registry. Others are making contingency plans to do so. Behind these low-profile moves, six shipping executives said, lie concerns that their ships could be commandeered by Chinese authorities or hit with U.S. sanctions in a conflict between Beijing and Washington. Beijing’s emphasis on the role of Hong Kong in serving Chinese security interests and growing U.S. scrutiny of the importance of China’s commercial fleet in a possible military clash, such as over Taiwan, are causing unease across the industry, the people told Reuters. The U.S. Trade Representative’s office last month proposed levying steep U.S. port fees on Chinese shipping companies and others that operate Chinese-built vessels, to counter China’s “targeted dominance” of shipbuilding and maritime logistics. USTR’s $1.5M Port Fee Proposal on Chinese Ships Sparks Industry Confusion Over Critical Definitions Washington in September warned American businesses about growing risks of operating in Hong Kong, where the U.S. already applies sanctions against officials involved in a security crackdown. Hong Kong for more than a century has been a hub for shipowners and the brokers, financiers, underwriters and lawyers supporting them. Its maritime and port industry accounted for 4.2% of GDP in 2022, official data show. The city’s flag is the eighth most-flown by ships worldwide, according to VesselsValue, a subsidiary of maritime data group Veson Nautical. Reuters interviews with two dozen people, including shipping executives, insurers and lawyers familiar with Hong Kong, revealed growing concern that commercial maritime operations could be ensnared by forces beyond their control in a U.S.-China military clash. Many pointed to China’s intensified focus on national security objectives; trade frictions; and the broad powers of Hong Kong’s leader, who is accountable to Beijing, to seize control of shipping in an emergency. “We don’t want to be in a position where China comes knocking, wanting our ships, and the U.S. is targeting us on the other side,” said one executive, who like others was granted anonymity to discuss a sensitive issue. The concerns of shipowners and their actions to curb exposure to Hong Kong have not been previously reported. The perceptions of risk have grown in recent years, coinciding with a tightening security climate in the Chinese-ruled city and tensions between the world’s two largest economies. Commercial ships must be registered, or flagged, with a particular country or jurisdiction to comply with safety and environmental rules. Despite an influx of Chinese-operated ships onto Hong Kong’s registry, the number of oceangoing vessels flagged in the city fell more than 8% to 2,366 in January from 2,580 four years earlier, according to independent analysis by VesselsValue. Government data show a similar drop. Among the ships that left Hong Kong’s registry, 74 re-flagged to Singapore and Marshall Islands in 2023 and 2024, chiefly dry-bulk carriers designed to transport commodities such as coal, iron ore and grain. Some 15 tankers and seven container ships separately left the Hong Kong registry for those flags, according to VesselsValue. The outflow of ships since 2021 marks a reversal for Hong Kong’s registry, which official data show grew roughly 400% in two decades following 1997. In response to Reuters questions, Hong Kong’s government said it was natural for shipping companies to review operations given changing geopolitical and trade circumstances, and normal for the number of ships on registries to fluctuate in the short term. Hong Kong would “continue to excel as a prominent international shipping centre”, a spokesperson said, outlining a range of incentives for shipowners, including profits tax breaks and green subsidies. Neither the laws governing the registry nor emergency provisions empowered Hong Kong’s leader to commandeer ships to serve in a Chinese merchant fleet, the spokesperson said. The spokesperson declined to elaborate when asked about industry players’ concerns over how colonial-era emergency powers might be applied during a U.S.-China conflict. The provisions allow the city’s leader to make “any regulations whatsoever”, including taking control of vessels and property. China’s defence and commerce ministries didn’t respond to questions about the role of a merchant fleet in Beijing’s warfighting plans, the potential involvement of Hong Kong-flagged vessels, and the worries of commercial shipowners. The U.S. Treasury and Pentagon declined to comment about potential sanctions, shipping executives’ concerns, and the role of Hong Kong-registered vessels in a Chinese merchant fleet. Lawyers and executives say ships can be re-flagged for various reasons through sale, charter or redeployment to different routes. Basil Karatzas, U.S.-based consultant with Karatzas Marine Advisors & Co, said Singapore had become the preferred domicile for companies with lesser exposure to Chinese shipping and cargo trade, because it offered many efficiencies, including its legal system, but less risk than Hong Kong. Singapore’s Maritime and Port Authority said decisions about domiciles and flagging were based on commercial considerations. It had not observed any “significant change” in the number of Hong Kong-based shipping companies relocating operations or re-flagging vessels to Singapore. Hong Kong’s shipping registry is widely regarded for its safety and regulatory standards, executives and lawyers say, allowing its ships to pass easily through foreign ports. Hong Kong’s flag is now flown by many of China’s state-owned international vessels. In a conflict, these tankers, bulk carriers and large container vessels would form the backbone of a merchant fleet serving the People’s Liberation Army to supply China’s oil, food and industrial needs, according to four security analysts and PLA military studies. By contrast, the U.S. has a small commercial shipbuilding industry and far fewer ships under its flag. While China’s state-owned fleet is growing in size, it would be a target for the U.S. in a military clash, and Beijing would likely require other vessels to ensure supplies given its vast needs and reliance on international sea lanes, three analysts said. Strategic maritime operations have surfaced on President Donald Trump’s radar. In his inauguration speech in January, Trump threatened to “take back” the Panama Canal, which he said had fallen under Chinese control. He did not give specifics, but Trump’s remarks focused attention on two Panama ports operated by a subsidiary of Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison Holdings 0001.HK. The group, which didn’t respond to questions about Trump’s comments, agreed this week to sell a majority stake in the subsidiary to a consortium of investors led by BlackRock BLK.N, giving U.S. interests control over the ports. Trump told Congress on Tuesday that his administration will create an office of shipbuilding in the White House and offer new tax incentives for the sector. A U.S. congressional study in November 2023 stated that “cargo ships typically transport 90% of the military equipment needed in overseas wars”. It noted that Chinese shipyards had 1,794 large oceangoing ships on order in 2022, compared with five in the U.S. Merchant vessels were vital in Britain’s long-range mission to retake the Falkland Islands from Argentina in 1982. And UK-flagged commercial ships operating out of Hong Kong – many owned by local firms dependent on or controlled by China – supplied communist Hanoi during the Vietnam War, frustrating the U.S., declassified CIA documents show. The need for a strong Chinese merchant fleet to help build China’s maritime power was outlined by President Xi Jinping in a Politburo study session in 2013. Over the last decade, Chinese government and military documents and studies have highlighted the dual-use military value of China’s merchant ships. Regulations enacted in 2015 required Chinese builders of five types of commercial vessels – including tankers, container ships and bulk carriers – to ensure they could serve military needs, according to state media. Since then, the state-owned COSCO line has grown significantly. Public COSCO documents show China is placing political commissars – officers who ensure Communist Party goals are ultimately served – on nominally civilian ships. In January, the U.S. blacklisted COSCO subsidiaries for what it said were links to the Chinese military. COSCO did not respond to questions about its deployment of commissars, the U.S. restrictions and what role the company’s ships, including Hong Kong-flagged ones, might play in a wartime scenario. Hong Kong remains an important base for shipowners, despite the geopolitical challenges. But some are quietly hedging their bets. One company founded in Hong Kong in 2014, London-listed Taylor Maritime TMI.L, now has a smaller presence in Hong Kong after making several strategic moves over the past few years. Since 2021, it has kept its ships flagged in the Marshall Islands and Singapore. Its offices are in London, Guernsey, Singapore, Hong Kong and Durban. The firm “really de-risked Hong Kong”, said a person familiar with the matter, citing investors’ concerns about a Chinese invasion of Taiwan and the Communist Party’s increasing control of Hong Kong. A Taylor Maritime spokesperson said that initially, the company moved its Asia-based commercial teams to Singapore from Hong Kong to be closer to clients. With its acquisition of shipping company Grindrod, which had its Asia office in Singapore, Taylor Maritime expanded its operation there and relocated some functions from Hong Kong, to the point where Singapore became its primary Asia hub, the spokesperson added. Hong Kong-listed Pacific Basin Shipping 2343.HK has traditionally flagged its 110-strong fleet of bulk carriers in Hong Kong but is drafting contingency plans to register them elsewhere as it gauges potential risks, said two people familiar with the matter. A Pacific Basin spokesperson said the company was constantly evaluating geopolitical risks but that its fleet was still flying the Hong Kong flag, “which at least for now outweigh(s) the challenges”. “Being in Hong Kong positions us close to China’s 40% share of global dry bulk import/export activity and close to Asia’s strong economic and industrial growth regions,” the spokesperson said. Angad Banga, chairman of the Hong Kong Shipowners Association, said shipping firms adjusted contingency plans based on risk assessments in a complex geopolitical environment but he had not encountered concerns about the commandeering of vessels. “While some may be reviewing operational strategies, we as an organisation do not to see any widespread exodus or loss of confidence in Hong Kong,” Banga told Reuters, adding that the city remained attractive for maritime commerce. Yet some industry figures described a broad unease about Hong Kong that was affecting their planning. Three lawyers said that until recent years, contracts hammered out for the growing number of ships built in China and financed by Chinese banks typically stipulated that they must fly the Hong Kong flag. But over the last two years, some have included a caveat demanded by owners to provide flexibility: a few other prominent flags are listed as options alongside Hong Kong, the lawyers said. Reuters could not independently verify the changes. Beyond China’s military modernisation and its refusal to renounce the use of force to seize Taiwan, Beijing officials have stressed the importance of Hong Kong in fulfilling national security priorities. Three executives and two lawyers told Reuters that sweeping security legislation, first imposed on Hong Kong in July 2020 and strengthened in March 2024, had added to the dangers. The lawyers said any move by Hong Kong’s leader to commandeer vessels in an emergency might prove difficult in practice, as locally registered ships often plied routes far from Hong Kong. But such long-standing powers now had to be viewed through a national security lens, they said. Some shipowners wouldn’t object to an official request to turn over their vessels, either out of patriotism or the potential to profit from a crisis, one lawyer said. But “it is better not to be in a position where you might even be asked”, said another veteran lawyer. “It was not an issue just a few years ago, in what is clearly a redrawn national security map.” (Reporting by Greg Torode and Jonathan Saul; additional reporting by Andrea Shalal and Idrees Ali in Washington, and the Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong newsrooms; editing by David Crawshaw) (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2025.

Title: As Trump Hails Taking Back of Panama Canal, Hong Kong Inc Walks Tightrope

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio tours the Miraflores locks at the Panama Canal in Panama City, Feb. 2, 2025. Mark Schiefelbein/Pool via REUTERS HONG KONG, March 6 (Reuters) – Hong Kong‘s edge as a financial hub will erode further as the city becomes embroiled in China-U.S. tensions, with the flash sale of a Hong Kong-owned global ports business highlighting geopolitical volatility, executives and analysts said. The former British colony is caught in the eye of a storm between Beijing and Washington, underlined by the decision by conglomerate CK Hutchison, controlled by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing, to sell its ports network, including assets along the Panama Canal, to a U.S. consortium led by BlackRock. U.S. President Donald Trump, who claimed in January that the Panama Canal was being operated by a Chinese company, has hailed the deal. “The Trump administration is going to see that this worked…and you have to assume they’re going to follow the same play book…(they) see this as a victory,” Steven Okun, a senior adviser to financial and risk advisory Kroll, told Reuters. As the U.S. strives to contain its main global rival China on fronts including trade, shipping, technology and capital raising, a dozen business people, investors, lawyers, shipping executives and risk analysts who spoke to Reuters say this is bringing greater uncertainty and volatility to Hong Kong. Hong Kong firms have traditionally been seen as internationally-focused and independent of the Chinese state, reflecting the role of the former British colony as a freewheeling financial hub. “We have been constantly reviewing our business plan and discussing about our strategy because of the political tension,” said an executive of a listed Hong Kong company who declined to be named given the sensitivity of the topic. “For example, do we still want to list our units in Hong Kong and is Hong Kong still attractive as a listing venue, because investors could draw a China connection,” he told Reuters. Hong Kong has a separate rule of law from China and its own financial policy-making autonomy, but some lawyers, diplomats and business executives say that after China’s imposition of a national security law in 2020, the city was essentially being viewed by the West as fully under the control of Beijing. This has hurt it economically and cast doubt on whether it is a jurisdiction separate from mainland China with global best practices, they said. Earlier this year, Hong Kong’s Far East Consortium and Chow Tai Fook Enterprise, which owns a development with Star Entertainment, the embattled casino group in Brisbane, tried to buy Star out. If successful, the bid will be another test of regulators who view Hong Kong companies as Chinese. In 2018, Australia blocked a A$13 billion ($8.2 billion) takeover of the country’s biggest gas pipeline company, APA Group APA.AX, by CK Infrastructure, a unit of CK Hutchison, citing it would be against the national interest. “Hong Kong is being increasingly lumped in with China … that’s a fact,” said a board member of a leading Hong Kong business family with interests locally and overseas, including retail and property. “To a degree, this has raised the complexity and cost in our business dealings. We have to live with this.” According to a person with knowledge of the matter, CK Hutchison had initially tried to fight to keep its two main port businesses in Panama after Trump alleged the Panama Canal was under Chinese control. But later, Hutchison opted to cash out and mitigate longer term reputational risks. “People in the Hutch empire are running for cover,” said the person with knowledge of the ports negotiations, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue. “This is a nightmare situation and we’ve never dealt with anything like this before.” This source added that CK Hutchison executives were in touch with officials in Beijing while the situation unfolded. CK Hutchison did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Co-managing director Frank Sixt said in a statement this week the ports transaction was “unrelated to recent political news reports.” The Hong Kong government has said it has never interfered with the commercial operations of Hong Kong companies, and criticized U.S. officials for making what it said were unreasonable and distorted accusations regarding the operation of the Panama Canal. “It’s been politicized and weaponised,” a senior Chinese government official said of the Trump administration’s framing of Hutchison as a Chinese entity – something the firm has denied. “It’s unfortunate and regrettable,” the official told Reuters, declining to be identified. Others, including business executives and lawyers, agreed that Hong Kong is increasingly being viewed as similar to other Chinese cities, even though officials like the territory’s financial secretary, Paul Chan, say the city remains a global hub for the free flow of capital, goods and people. “The market is based on expectations,” said Vera Yuen, an economics lecturer with the University of Hong Kong business school. “The valuation (of Hong Kong) is based on what they (the world) think, not what you claim.” Even ahead of the recent Trump administration pressure on Hutchison’s Panama ports, some local firms with international reach had been drawing up contingency plans to deal with growing U.S.-China strategic rivalry – and a growing sense Hong Kong would be in the crosshairs in a conflict. In 2023, Hong Kong-based conglomerate Swire Pacific sold its Swire Coca-Cola USA unit to its controlling shareholder, John Swire & Sons Ltd headquartered in the U.K., to protect the business so that it would no longer be seen as being held by a “Chinese company,” two sources with knowledge of the matter said. A Hong Kong shipping firm executive described how his operation was already presenting its international posture in meetings with foreign investors. “The key is being as international as we can – our offices, domiciles and ships,” the executive said. “We want to be able to show we are not really based anywhere.” ($1 = 1.5780 Australian dollars) (Additional reporting by Greg Torode and Jessie Pang in Hong Kong; Scott Murdoch in Sydney and Beijing Newsroom; Writing by James Pomfret; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan) (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2025.

Video Llewellyn King is the creator, executive producer and host of “White House Chronicle,” a weekly news and public affairs program, airing nationwide on PBS and public, educational and government... Video recording of the session at the bottom of this post, along with open Q&A discussion from the session taking place actively on the Energy Central Community: Lee Zeldin, new Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, has said, “It’s important for us urgently to do everything in our power to make sure Americans have the cleanest air, land, and water. That’s something that keeps me up at night." Environmentalists and many in the energy sector believe the Trump administration is doing just the opposite. It has taken aim at a raft of laws and regulations which protect the environment, including the National Environmental Policy Act, bulwark of a vast structure of environmental laws and protections since it was signed into law by President Nixon in 1970. There is alarm in the utility industry about the administration’s antipathy to wind generation. Its enthusiasm for coal alarms clean air advocates who see it as a step backward. There also is alarm about the future of transitional funding guaranteed during the Biden administration, under the Inflation Reduction Act, to enhance clean energy and finance transition from polluting fuels to green ones. That funding is frozen and the Department of Government Efficiency operatives have slashed employment in the Department of Energy’s loan office. What now? The rural electric cooperatives are worried about $9 billion in financing they were to get from the Department of Agriculture for rural electrification projects. Lesser laws like the Endangered Species Act, it is feared by their defenders, may be repealed or circumvented. The United States Energy Association at its most recent virtual press briefing, conducted on March 5, examined what to expect from the Trump administration in its reshaping of environmental policy, and the nature and scope of the legal opposition. Court challenges have already been filed and many more are expected. As usual, a panel of experts were questioned by a panel of senior journalists who cover energy and the environment. Journalist Llewellyn King organized and moderated the press briefings, which are broadcast live on Zoom and last an hour. Mark Menezes gave welcoming remarks and was on hand to share his deep knowledge as president and CEO of USEA and as a former deputy secretary of energy.

Title: World beginning to tire of whiplash leadership...
URL: https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/06/politics/trump-canada-mexico-tariffs-whiplash-analysis/index.html
Time Published: 2025-03-06T15:00:03Z

Follow: Government by chaos is back. One day, President Donald Trump imposed a punishing tariff regime against Canada and Mexico. The next, he froze auto duties for a month after suddenly realizing that – as everyone had predicted – they could wreck a quintessential American industry. Last week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky came to the Oval Office to sign a rare-earth minerals deal that Trump billed as a triumph for the US. But Zelensky was provoked by Vice President JD Vance and kicked out of the White House. European leaders have spent days trying to fix the debacle. Elon Musk, meanwhile, is taking his chainsaw to the bureaucracy, indiscriminately firing workers and feeding agencies into the wood chipper – pitching citizens and industries who rely on government payments into uncertainty just as the economy softens and is more vulnerable to such shocks. At first, Trump’s early-term energy on multiple fronts was a bolt of energy as he scratched his Sharpie across executive orders and chased away the lethargy that marked President Joe Biden’s waning months in office. Six weeks in, however, as Trump makes gut-check calls to dismantle post-Cold War national security arrangements, the global free trade system, and the federal machine – all of which helped make the US a superpower – a new realization is dawning. There doesn’t seem to be a plan. Trump’s haphazard efforts to make peace in Ukraine, revive Rust Belt-heavy industry with 19th century-style tariffs and slash government are as improvisational as the “weave” – his name for his stream-of-consciousness campaign screeds. And the world is once again left hanging on the “America first” president’s whims and obsessions. “There’s too much unpredictability and chaos coming out of the White House right now,” Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly said Wednesday, describing US trade policy as a “psychodrama” her country can’t go through every 30 days. America’s friends are often left to puzzle over what exactly Trump is trying to do. The president, for instance, said Wednesday that Canada hadn’t done enough to stem the flow of fentanyl over the border – but only minuscule amounts of the drug are involved. Sometimes the White House complains about the flow south of undocumented migrants – but these numbers are also small. Trump also wants manufacturing to leave Canada and move south. No wonder some officials in Ottawa have concluded he’s trying to weaken their country to make it easier to annex. Still, the president can point to some successes with his threat-based foreign policy. For instance, his fury that a Hong Kong-based firm owned two ports at either end of the Panama Canal is precipitating a purchase by US investment giant BlackRock. The president had falsely claimed these ports meant China controlled the vital waterway built by the US, but the change of ownership may still improve the US strategic position. And Trump might be downgrading the transatlantic alliance that has kept world peace for 80 years – but he’s set off an unprecedented rearmament program among NATO allies that other presidents have demanded for years. But just as often, it’s as if Trump is more interested in brute force personal power than working off any long-term playbook. Michael Froman, a former US trade representative who chairs the Council on Foreign Relations, told Jim Sciutto on CNN International Wednesday that while the cost of imposing tariffs often outweighs the benefits, they can be a tool that gets other nations to the negotiating table. This is true in the case of Mexico with which the US has far wider border issues than Canada. But, Froman added, “you have to know what it is you want them to do for that leverage to be useful.” To some extent, the chaos is the point. And the theatrics of a president addicted to stunt politics are key to his political appeal. But allied governments have their own politics to worry about – a factor the Trump administration often seems to ignore. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum – who is, like Trump, new in office and keen to make a mark – said Wednesday that her country could consider alternative trade partners to the United States “if necessary.” On Tuesday, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer pointedly paid tribute in the House of Commons to British soldiers who were killed fighting alongside the United States in Iraq and Afghanistan. This followed a comment by Vance on Fox News that Ukraine needed better security guarantees than undertakings from “some random country that has not fought a war in 30 or 40 years.” The vice president’s remark caused great offensive in Britain. He said on X that claims he’d been talking about Britain and France were “absurdly dishonest,” but those are the only allies who have so far publicly volunteered to take part in a post-peace deal reassurance force in Ukraine. And French President Emmanuel Macron warned his compatriots Wednesday evening the world had changed utterly since Trump returned to the White House, adding that he was considering extending the protection of France’s nuclear arsenal to European allies. For some MAGA supporters, Trump’s genius for enraging Democrats, the media and foreign governments is an end in itself. And for ideologues on the populist nationalist right, sparking pandemonium in Washington and destroying governing agencies is a way of deconstructing the administrative state. Trump’s method was honed in his office high up in the skyscraper that bears his name in Manhattan. The future president learned through his real estate career how to push opponents off balance with outlandish demands, verbal confrontations and sudden switches of position. In government, he does the same thing to disorientate adversaries and seeks to impose power amid the mayhem. But while unpredictability is a real estate superpower, it’s a liability when running a country, an economy and a planet – where continuity and predictability are preferred. “It’s just constant, and it’s exhausting,” said Julian Vikan Karaguesian, a former Canadian Ministry of Finance official, referring to Trump’s scorched-earth tariff offensive. “It’s almost surreal. Is it real? Is it going to be real this time?” Karaguesian, who now lectures at McGill University in Montreal, added: “Maybe the modus operandi here is uncertainty. It’s not tariffs, it’s not anything else, but intentionally creating a sense of chaos and a sense of uncertainty.” The auto tariffs that the president froze for a month on Wednesday, a day after imposing blanket 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, shows how he sometimes has second thoughts about his own aggression. Perhaps his favorite barometer, the stock market, forced his hand. His concession reversed two days of steep losses on the Dow Jones Industrial Average with a handy near-500-point rebound. CNN reported Wednesday that Trump relented after conversations with the CEOs of the Big Three automakers. And his press secretary Karoline Leavitt said he was open to “hearing about additional exemptions.” The idea that well-placed CEOs can use their access to the powerful to acquire exemptions and special favors not available to ordinary Americans is the antithesis of an equitable economy. But then Trump has shown little respect for rules-based systems that eliminate the kind of patronage and potential for corruption that thrives in autocratic societies. Trump’s approach may also mean he likes threatening tariffs more than imposing them. But by constantly threatening tariffs and then creating doubt about whether or when they will be maintained, the president is causing huge uncertainty for businesses that need to establish certainty of costs and supply and consumers who could damage an already-softening economy if they rein in spending. “There’s so much uncertainty about what the administration is doing that the mere prospect of tariffs is creating a big anchor on the economy,” Bharat Ramamurti, former deputy director of Biden’s National Economic Council, told reporters on a conference call Monday. “The prospect of significant tariffs on our allies has resulted in withholding investments and preemptive price increases that are going to be borne by small businesses and, ultimately, by consumers.” Trump’s relentless bullying of America’s friends – while seemingly doing everything he can to advance its traditional adversary Russia in Ukraine – may also drain US power in the long run. “What we have seen this week is that the dollar has suffered a very sharp decline,” Ruchir Sharma, founder and chief investment officer of Breakout Capital, told Richard Quest on CNN International. “It’s revealing that the rest of the world is getting its act together … and I think investors are beginning to notice there are other countries worth investing in, given all this policy volatility that is emerging in the US,” he said. The danger for the US therefore is that four more years of Trump’s antics could reshape the globe – in a way that does not comply with his vision of US dominance but leaves Americans looking in from the outside. Mexico and Canada, for instance, can’t change the geography that makes it a no-brainer to trade with the mighty US. But both also may see advantages in expanding trade and investment with America’s rising rival China. And the European Union, which is expecting its own barrage of Trump tariffs soon, may examine similar horizons. America’s Western allies have too much invested in generations with ties with Washington to want it to fail. But they have their own national interests too. Canada can’t win a trade war against its more powerful neighbor. But its patience is thin over Trump’s brinkmanship and bullying. Doug Ford, the premier of Ontario, home to Canada’s largest provincial economy, says the only way forward is for Trump to eradicate all tariffs rather than an a la carte easing of duties industry by industry, as with autos. “All this gives us is uncertainty again,” Ford told CNN’s Phil Mattingly on Wednesday. “There is one person that’s causing that problem today: that’s President Trump.” © 2025 Cable News Network.

Title: How a falling dollar index [DXY] can push Bitcoin to $100,000

The dollar index is having a positive effect on BTC. In the last 24 hours, Bitcoin [BTC] has seen a gradual price increase, crossing back into the $90,000 region. It was around $92,500 as of this writing, following a 6.12% gain. This recent accumulation is driven by the Dollar Index losing strength and investors gradually building buying momentum. If sentiment continues to grow, the asset is likely to see a major push to the upside and cross above the $100,000 region. There has been a decline in the U.S. Dollar Index [DXY], which measures the strength of the dollar against a basket of six commodities. Historically, a weakening dollar index tends to benefit cryptocurrencies like BTC and altcoins. In the last two market cycles—2017 and 2021—BTC gained ground and saw major market moves following a decline in the dollar index. A similar trend was observed with altcoins, which experienced significant gains, as seen in the chart below. Source: X If key levels hold as indicated and the DXY chart follows the pattern of the past two cycles, the cryptocurrency market, particularly BTC, could gain an edge for an upswing. The amount of Bitcoin sold in the spot market over the past 24 hours has begun to decline. As of the time of writing, BTC sales totaled $163.54 million on the 5th of March but have since dropped to $87.12 million. If this trend continues, it is more likely that investors will begin accumulating again, leading to increased exchange net inflows. Similarly, the fund market premium—which measures whether investors are buying or selling based on whether it is above or below zero—was at 0.2 at press time, indicating buying activity. Source: CryptoQuant However, a closer look at the chart shows that the fund market premium has remained at a similar level since March began, moving along a steady line. This suggests that investors are likely accumulating BTC in anticipation of a major upward move. After days of consistent market outflows from the Bitcoin exchange-traded funds [ETF] market—indicating institutional investors are selling BTC—the sentiment is shifting. BlackRock, a notable institutional investor with over $50 billion in BTC ETF via IBIT, has stopped selling. When selling slows or halts, it often signals that investors are reassessing their positions and may soon resume buying, especially in a bullish environment. At the time of writing, BTC ETFs recorded an inflow of $22 million in the past 24 hours, indicating renewed interest among institutional investors.

A biotech company’s new therapy has done something remarkable: help children who were born blind to see for the first time. Publicly-traded MeiraGTx has developed targeted gene therapy methods to treat genetic disorders, like one that degrades the retina, impacting hundreds of children born each year. But the company isn’t just working on eye-related disorders: It has its sights set on treating Parkinson’s. Zandy Forbes, an alumna of Forbes 50 Over 50 who is not related to the Forbes family, started MeiraGTx in 2015. In the first nine months of 2024, the biotech firm reported about $12 million in revenue, and Forbes expects that to increase when its first therapy is approved by regulators. Dodge vehicles parked outside a dealership in Edmonton, Canada, last month. President Donald Trump exempted U.S. automakers from the 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports for one month, as the import taxes are expected to drive up the price of new cars by thousands of dollars. Trump Administration officials reportedly met with the three biggest U.S. carmakers—Ford, General Motors and Chrysler parent Stellantis—on Tuesday.

Trump said in his address to Congress on Tuesday that he wants to “bring down mortgage rates,” but significant decreases often come at times of economic distress. CEOs are often critical of short sellers, who profit from a company’s downfall. But they’re not putting their money where their mouth is: A new study from researchers at the University of Kansas and Appalachian State University found that executives claiming their stock is being hammered by short sellers are more likely to be selling their own shares. Tennessee mogul Forrest Preston ran Life Care Centers of America, America’s largest privately-held nursing home chain, for more than five decades, but this week, a court found the 91-year-old to be unfit to lead the $3 billion business. His son Aubrey, who first alleged that Forrest was being abused and robbed by his much younger wife and former caregiver, was named his father’s permanent conservator, and has taken control of the company.

The company said the fastest-growing segment of its contributors on Outlier over the last year are workers in the U.S. A Hong Kong-based conglomerate controlled by billionaire Li Ka-shing has agreed to sell a majority stake in its Panama Canal ports to a consortium led by BlackRock, as President Donald Trump has criticized what he sees as Chinese influence over the waterway critical to global trade. The deal is worth $22.8 billion and would earn cash proceeds of more than $19 billion for CK Hutchison Holdings, whose business operations span ports, retail, infrastructure and telecommunications across the globe. Before Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump were announced as board members of Dominari Holdings Inc., trading in the firm soared, and the boost has raised the suspicions of some securities law experts. In all of 2024, Dominari Holdings’ trading volume was 3.2 million, just one-seventh of its volume on February 10, the day before the Trumps’ involvement was announced.

The musical will soon announce an alternative venue for the shows in the Washington area, the New York Times reported. China escalated its threats of retaliation after President Donald Trump levied an additional 10% tariff on Chinese imports to the U.S. on Tuesday. “If war is what the U.S. wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war or any other type of war, we’re ready to fight till the end,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said. The White House is directly negotiating with Hamas for the release of the remaining U.S. hostages and a permanent end to the conflict in Gaza, breaking its long-standing precedent against negotiating directly with Foreign Terrorist Organizations. But in a post on Truth Social on Wednesday, Trump gave a “last warning” to Hamas, telling the militant group to free all remaining hostages and saying “not a single Hamas member will be safe if you don’t do as I say.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Thursday that a Russian “ballistic missile” struck a hotel housing American and British volunteers in the city of Kryvyi Rih. In a social media post, Zelenskyy wrote that Ukrainian authorities were carrying out an “all night rescue mission” after the attack, which killed four people—though the U.S. and U.K. nationals managed to escape.

President Donald Trump and Elon Musk watch the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket on November 19. TOPLINE Across the U.S., a web of ancient copper wires connect airport control towers to radars and weather observation stations, helping air traffic controllers communicate and get the data they need to make sure planes get where they’re supposed to go safely. But this decades-old system is starting to fail. Airports have been forced to ground planes due to telecommunications failures. Now, after a series of near misses and a shocking midair collision in Washington, D.C. that killed 67 people, the pressure is on the Trump Administration to address rising public fear over air safety. Help is on the way, newly minted Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy reassured the public a week after the disaster. Elon Musk and SpaceX were stepping in. The billionaire’s company reportedly may be tapped for a crash upgrade of the FAA’s telecom system, never mind that it didn’t play a role in the Washington disaster. And never mind that Verizon already has a $2.4 billion, 15-year contract to replace all that copper wire with lightning-fast fiber-optic cables. A SpaceX engineer tasked to the FAA told agency staffers that Musk himself had directed that they deploy thousands of the company’s Starlink satellite internet terminals, according to Bloomberg. WHY IT MATTERS That creates obvious and serious conflicts of interests, with Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency currently burrowing into the agency that acts as SpaceX’s primary regulator. But worse, it makes no sense, writes Forbes’ Jeremy Bogaisky. Starlink may be suitable to connect remote FAA facilities, but it doesn’t currently have the bandwidth or reliability to serve as the backbone of the agency’s nationwide communications network. Plus, SpaceX has no apparent experience in serving as a prime contractor for a solution incorporating a mix of communications technologies. The turmoil could end up delaying a badly needed modernization project. MORE For The Army, The D.C.

We rely on your support for our independence, diversity and quality.

Germany’s recent election results have brought to the forefront the deepening fractures within the nation’s politics and society. The election showcased a significant shift in the political landscape, with the rise of the Alternative for Germany (AfD), a far-right party that has gained considerable support, particularly in the former East German territories. This, in conjunction with a weakening of the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) and a fragmented political environment, reveals the complexities Germany faces in its efforts to govern effectively. A divided political landscape The election results underscored the ongoing fragmentation of Germany’s political system. The SPD, led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz, saw a significant decline, securing only 16.4% of the vote. While this result was expected due to the party’s struggles in recent years, it has led to a situation where the SPD has lost much of its influence in shaping the nation’s future. On the other hand, the Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU), while victorious, achieved only 28.6% of the vote. This result demonstrates that even the center-right, long the dominant force in German politics, is no longer able to secure a decisive win without relying on coalitions. The rise of the AfD, which secured 20.8% of the vote, is perhaps the most striking outcome of this election. Although their support is still strongest in the former East Germany, where they garnered 29.7% of the vote, the AfD is beginning to make inroads into the West, achieving 13% of the vote in regions that were once firmly supportive of the CDU/CSU. This growing influence of the AfD highlights the increasing polarization of German politics and society, driven in part by economic insecurity, immigration concerns and the cultural tensions surrounding globalization. In addition to the rise of the AfD, the election results also revealed the diminished strength of the SPD, the Greens and the Free Democratic Party (FDP). These parties, which had formed the previous traffic light coalition government, struggled to present a unified front. The fractious nature of this coalition led to inefficiencies in governance and left the electorate dissatisfied. The lack of progress on key issues such as inflation, immigration and economic reform contributed to the overall sense of disillusionment with the current political establishment. The roots of AfD support: economic struggles and immigration concerns The AfD’s strong performance can be attributed to a combination of factors, with two key issues standing out: economic discontent and concerns over immigration. Germany’s economy has struggled in recent years, with no GDP growth for several consecutive years. The country has faced multiple crises, from the effects of the Russia–Ukraine war to challenges stemming from global inflation. These economic difficulties have taken a toll on the German population, particularly in the former East, where unemployment rates remain higher and economic opportunities more limited. Moreover, immigration has become a deeply divisive issue in German society. With a growing percentage of the population born outside of Germany, many citizens feel a sense of cultural insecurity and fear that the nation’s identity is being eroded. The AfD has capitalized on these fears, advocating for tighter immigration controls and a reassertion of German values. Their message has resonated particularly in the East, where the legacy of reunification remains a source of tension. While Germany does require immigration to address its demographic challenges and labor shortages, the rapid pace of immigration has created a perception of cultural and economic strain. This issue has been exacerbated by the ongoing debates over asylum policies and the EU’s handling of migration. The AfD’s success can thus be seen as a reaction to the perceived failure of the political establishment to address these concerns effectively. The CDU’s shift toward the far-right In response to the AfD’s growing influence, the CDU, under the leadership of Friedrich Merz, has begun to shift its stance toward the far-right. Merz, a former lawyer with ties to major international firms, including BlackRock, has sought to consolidate the center-right vote by adopting some of the AfD’s positions, particularly on issues like immigration. His proposals for stricter asylum laws and the tightening of border controls echo the policies championed by the AfD and reflect the growing pressure on the CDU to adopt a tougher stance on migration. Merz’s strategy, however, raises questions about the future direction of the CDU and its relationship with the AfD. While some analysts argue that the CDU is attempting to outflank the AfD on the right, others warn that this could further erode the party’s centrist identity and deepen the political polarization in Germany. The shift to the right is already being felt in the party’s rhetoric, with Merz calling for deregulation of the economy and stronger defense policies in line with the rising nationalist sentiment in Europe. The impact of Germany’s political instability on Europe Germany’s political instability and economic challenges have broader implications for the future of Europe. As the heart of the European Union, Germany’s struggles to maintain political cohesion and economic stability could have far-reaching consequences for the entire continent. A fractured Germany is unlikely to provide the leadership needed to navigate the complex geopolitical challenges facing Europe, from the ongoing conflict in Ukraine to the growing threat posed by Russia. The lack of a strong, unified German government also undermines Europe’s ability to respond effectively to global challenges. With the United States increasingly focused on domestic issues and shifting its attention away from Europe, the continent may find itself exposed to geopolitical risks. In the absence of a coherent European strategy, populist leaders like Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin could exploit Europe’s weaknesses, further undermining the region’s influence on the global stage. Germany’s failure to address its internal divisions could result in a Europe that is fragmented, weakened and increasingly susceptible to external pressures. As the continent grapples with an aging population, economic stagnation and rising political extremism, the prospect of a more cohesive EU seems increasingly unlikely. A long road ahead Germany’s political future is uncertain, with deep divisions in society and a lack of consensus on key issues. The rise of the AfD and the CDU’s shift toward the far-right reflect the growing dissatisfaction with the political establishment and the challenges facing Germany in the 21st century. As the country grapples with economic stagnation, immigration concerns and a fractured political system, the path forward will require difficult compromises and painful reforms. Without a strong and unified government, Germany risks losing its leadership role in Europe, leaving the continent vulnerable to external threats and internal disarray. The coming years will be critical in determining whether Germany can overcome its political paralysis and reclaim its position as a stable and effective force in Europe and the world.

Title: Trump hails retaliatory tariffs in defense of America's jobs and its soul

Manufacturers are already shifting some operations from Asia in response to his policy, Trump says. By Mike Firn for RFA 2025.03.05 BANGKOK -- U.S. President Donald Trump defended on Tuesday his policy on tariffs saying reciprocal duties to be imposed across the board from April 2 would not only protect U.S. jobs but would defend the soul of the country. Trump, in his address to a joint session of Congress six weeks after taking office for a second term, said tariffs was "a beautiful word" and his policy was already seeing manufacturers relocating facilities to the U.S. from Asia. "On April 2, reciprocal tariffs kick in and whatever they charge us on tariffs we will charge them, a reciprocal back and forth," Trump said to the applause of his Republican supporters. "If they use non-monetary tariffs to keep us out of their market, we will use non-monetary barriers to keep them out of our market." Earlier on Tuesday, the U.S. imposed 25% duties on Mexican and Canadian imports and doubled tariffs imposed on China last month to 20%. China responded immediately, taxing U.S. farm imports by as much as 15%. It also imposed export and investment restrictions on 25 American firms, citing national security. "The Chinese people will not be intimidated," Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said at a regular news conference. In his speech to Congress, Trump said China was already taxing U.S. exporters too much. "China's average tariff is twice what we charge them," he said, adding that he would match any country's retaliatory tariffs. Trump said the threat of tariffs had already had an impact on the business plans of Japan's Honda, America's Apple and Taiwan chipmaker TSMC. All three companies recently announced large investments to shift some manufacturing to the U.S. "If you don't make your product in America you will pay a tariff," Trump said. "Tariffs are not just about protecting American jobs, they are about protecting the soul of our country." While economists have warned of the impact of tariffs on pushing up prices for U.S. consumers, Trump dismissed concerns of any negative impact. "There may be a little bit of a disturbance but we're OK with that," he said. Trump said he could balance the budget while offering "tax cuts for everyone." China's premier Li Qiang said China's economy would match last year's growth in spite of a trade war with the U.S. Speaking at the opening of the annual National People's Congress in Beijing on Wednesday, he said the economy would expand by around 5% this year. Li said Beijing was willing to let the budget deficit expand to fuel an upturn in domestic demand as the "main engine and anchor" of growth. Trading accusations on drugs Part of the reason for Trump's tariffs on Mexico and Canada is what he says is their failure to stop the flow of deadly fentanyl into the United States, which the U.S. president said Tuesday was "destroying our families." Both of those countries have defended their actions to stop drug smuggling. Trump has also accused China of failing to stamp out production of the synthetic opioid but China says it has already done its part to control the drug and it should not be blamed for a U.S. "governance failure." On Tuesday, Beijing released a white paper highlighting the steps it had taken to control the spread of fentanyl. "These have delivered notable results," it said. Reporting on the findings, the state-run tabloid Global Times hit out at Trump for blaming China for America's opioid problem and punishing it with tariffs. "Shifting the responsibility for domestic governance failures onto others and abusing tariffs as a means of pressure and coercion will not cure America's ills, nor will it help Washington achieve its political objectives," it said in an editorial. In his speech, Trump also repeated his pledge to take control of the Panama Canal. "It was given away by the Carter administration for one dollar but that agreement has been violated," he said. "We didn't give it to China. We gave it to Panama and we're taking it back." Earlier on Tuesday, Hong Kong's CK Hutchison Holding said a consortium including America's BlackRock would acquire Hutchison Ports and Panama Ports giving it control of the ports at either end of the canal.

Title: Chinese FM responds to potential acquisition related to Panama Canal, opposes coercion in international trade

Global Times By Global Times Published: Mar 05, 2025 04:57 PM In response to media inquiries regarding a consortium led by US investment firm BlackRock potentially acquiring a Hong Kong company with the aim of taking control of Hong Kong company's stake in the Panama Canal, saying the move is under pressure of the White House, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian stated that we don't comment on the relevant business transaction. He noted that the Hong Kong SAR government had previously addressed issues related to the company's port operations. As a matter of principle, Lin emphasized that China supports its enterprises, including those from Hong Kong, in investing and developing businesses overseas. He also stressed that all countries should provide a fair and just environment for relevant enterprises, adding that we oppose the use of coercion and pressure in international economic and trade relations. When addressing another question related to the Panama Canal, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian stated that China supports Panama's sovereignty over the Panama Canal and is committed to upholding the Canal's status as a permanently neutral international waterway. He emphasized that China has never participated in managing or operating the Canal, nor has it interfered in its affairs. The claim that "China controls the Canal" is completely a lie, according to CCTV News on Wednesday.

Title: Panama President Mulino says Trump ‘lying’ about reclaiming the canal

Panamanian leader says sale of a Chinese company’s port operation to a US firm does not amount to retaking the waterway. Panama President Jose Raul Mulino has accused his American counterpart, Donald Trump, of lying when he told members of Congress that the United States is “reclaiming” the Panama Canal. In a statement posted on X on Wednesday, Mulino said the man-made waterway that connects the Atlantic and Pacific oceans “is not in the process of recovery” by Trump and the US government. “Once again, President Trump is lying,” Mulino wrote on X. “I reject, on behalf of Panama and all Panamanians, this new affront to the truth and to our dignity as a nation,” Mulino added. During the annual presidential address to the US Congress on Tuesday, Trump declared that Washington would be reclaiming the Panama Canal “to further enhance” US national security. “We’ve already started doing it. We’re taking it back.” He was referencing a deal announced on Tuesday for a consortium, led by the US investment management company BlackRock Inc, to buy a controlling stake in the company held by a Chinese group that operates ports at both ends of one of the busiest water channels in the world. In a filing, CK Hutchison Holding had announced that it would sell all shares in Hutchison Port Holdings and in Hutchison Port Group Holdings to BlackRock in a deal valued at nearly $23bn, including $5bn in debt. The deal has to be approved by Panama’s government. Trump has been talking about retaking the Panama Canal since his campaign, arguing the US should have never turned control over to the Panamanians and that the US was being overcharged for using it. Since returning to the White House, he has also started complaining that China controls the canal, and did not rule out a military invasion to regain control of it. Panama maintains it has full control over the canal and that the Hong Kong-based group’s operation of the ports did not amount to Chinese control over the waterway, and therefore the private sale to a US-based company would not represent any US “reclaiming” of the canal. In February, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Mulino and insisted that China was exerting influence over the canal’s operations. Panama rejected that China had any influence over canal operations. Beijing has also consistently denied interfering in the canal. The US built the canal in the early 1900s as it looked for ways to facilitate the transit of commercial and military vessels between its coasts. Washington relinquished control of the waterway to Panama on December 31, 1999, under a treaty signed in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter. Trump has claimed that Carter “foolishly” gave the canal away. The 80km (50-mile) canal handles 5 percent of global maritime trade and 40 percent of US container traffic. Follow Al Jazeera English:

Title: Brevan Howard's pitch to deep-pocketed investors: The 'true risk' of crypto is not having exposure
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/brevan-howard-digital-assets-crypto-investing-investor-pitch-aron-landy-2025-3
Time Published: 2025-03-06T10:03:01Z
Full Content:
Aron Landy — the CEO of $34 billion macro investment manager Brevan Howard — believes the "tipping point" that will lead institutional investors to pile into crypto is on the horizon. Years of volatility and big-name bad actors have kept institutions away from digital assets. Still, with a new administration in the US and asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity becoming more entrenched in the space, the world's biggest investors will slowly wade into the space — and then dive fully in. London-based Brevan Howard, through its $2.5 billion stand-alone crypto unit that was up over 52% last year, is aiming to be the place to go for crypto-curious institutions. "The predominant mindset in the institutional space has been that any exposure to digital assets is a little too volatile," Landy told Business Insider. "I believe that a shift in mindset is happening and that soon, even this year, having zero exposure to digital assets will be the true risk." "At the moment, it's kind of a separate asset class, but over time, there'll be a convergence," he added. That convergence may be sped up by President Donald Trump's administration. After years of frustration under former President Joe Biden's SEC commissioner Gary Gensler, President Donald Trump, and his crypto czar David Sacks have provided a jolt to the space. While some have been frustrated with the administration's crypto agenda, including the creation of meme coins related to Trump and the first lady, Melania Trump, and the strategic reserve of different digital assets, the election was a positive change for the industry, said Gautam Sharma, the CEO and chief investment officer of Brevan Howard Digital. Sharma declined to provide additional comment on the creation of the reserve. The size of the talent pool and the amount of capital in the US means the "vibe" around an industry can matter just as much as a specific policy, Sharma said. Brevan thinks of the industry as a "transformational technology" akin to the internet, Landy said, and "any new innovation needs two things: talent and capital," Sharma said. The two executives said there should be plenty of momentum to attract ambitious young people to the industry. "The digital asset universe has tailwinds, not headwinds," Landy said. September will be the unit's fourth anniversary, and Sharma told BI that the goal remains the same as when they launched in 2021. "Our objective is to be the leading asset manager for institutional investors in digital assets," he said, noting that the manager is working on a few additional products for institutional investors to add alongside its flagship multi-manager crypto fund. As the digital asset space becomes more integrated into financial institutions and accepted by regulators, big-name asset managers will follow suit. Former crypto critics, like Citadel Securities' Ken Griffin, are embracing the space and building out their offerings because of the tailwinds. Among alternative investors, especially those catering to large institutional investors like sovereign wealth and pension funds, Brevan has a relative headstart thanks partly to its founder, billionaire Alan Howard. Howard has been interested in the space for close to a decade and started investing his personal capital in 2016 and has seen firsthand how the industry has changed, Sharma said. "Alan understands this space better than most, not just the investing side of it but the systems," said Sharma, who previously ran internal projects for the hedge fund and oversaw the buildout of the digital assets business alongside Natalie Smith, the firm's head of strategy and client partnership group. Howard's enthusiasm led Brevan Howard Digital to focus not just on hiring investing staff, technologists, and engineers. The firm built the unit's infrastructure from scratch over six months in 2021 and now has a team of more than 60 people in eight offices that can trade around the clock. A person close to Brevan said the firm's digital asset investment products have "relatively long lock-up periods" to help the firm withstand volatility. It aligns with the firm's belief that small bumps in the road will be just that: bumps in the road. The digital asset industry "could be worth many multiples than what it is now," Landy said, and the firm wants to partner with institutions willing to back that long-term vision. The separate digital-asset unit invests in liquid coins such as Bitcoin but also options, derivatives, and private stakes in startups.

Title: Proxy Adviser Glass Lewis Sticks With Diversity Guidance, Will Flag Risks

Proxy adviser Glass Lewis will continue to consider boardroom diversity when advising how to vote at U.S. company annual meetings, but plans to be clearer about the counter argument for critical vote recommendations to help clients avoid rising political risks. The change comes amid a wave of retreat by U.S. corporations from their diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts, under threat of legal action by U.S. President Donald Trump’s Justice Department. The decision by Glass Lewis to remain largely committed to diversity follows a review of its policies and after proxy advisor rival Institutional Shareholder Services last month said it would no longer consider diversity when making its boardroom recommendations. In an e-mail to clients seen by Reuters, Glass Lewis said it will stand by its 2025 benchmark guidelines for U.S. companies, which include that shareholders vote against certain directors at some of the largest U.S. companies whose boards lack gender, racial or LGBTQ diversity. But when it recommends votes against a director in any way related to diversity, Glass Lewis said it will also flag information that could support an alternative vote by the client. “This approach allows Glass Lewis to deliver the vote recommendations expected by clients while also clearly flagging the potential risk that may result from an AGAINST vote decision and providing a clear path should some clients choose to vote FOR the proposal,” the firm said. A Glass Lewis spokeswoman said it also will likely include more context when making recommendations on diversity-related shareholder proposals. Glass Lewis and ISS dominate the U.S. market for selling recommendations about how investors should vote at corporate meetings on matters such as boardroom elections or executive pay. Glass Lewis counts some 1,300 clients globally including top pension plans, mutual funds and asset managers with more than $40 trillion in collective assets. Their policies are widely used by investors including mutual funds and pension plans which may not have the resources to do due diligence on every company in their portfolio. “Certainly, we would have preferred not to have had to deliberate over long-standing policy guidelines on board diversity and DEI shareholder proposals, but the U.S. Administration’s opposition to DEI is compelling companies, institutional investors and their proxy advisors to consider changes, now or in the future,” Glass Lewis’ note said. The move echoes steps taken by major asset managers including BlackRock BLK.N and Vanguard, which faced pressure over their voting decisions and in response looked to give clients more control.

Title: Panama President Issues Defiant Response To Trump Over 'Reclaiming' Canal Line

PANAMA CITY (AP) — Panama President José Raúl Mulino on Wednesday accused U.S. President Donald Trump of lying when he said in his address to Congress that his administration was “reclaiming” the Panama Canal. Trump was referencing a deal announced Tuesday for a consortium led by the U.S. investment management company BlackRock Inc. to buy a controlling stake in the company held by a Chinese group that operates ports at both ends of the Panama Canal. Panama maintains that it has full control over the canal and that the Hong Kong-based group’s operation of the ports did not amount to Chinese control over the waterway, and that therefore the sale to a U.S.-based company would not represent any U.S. “reclaiming” of the canal. Panama’s government on Tuesday called the sale a private transaction. Mulino in a message posted to X on Wednesday, rejected that the deal came about because of U.S. pressure. “I reject in the name of Panama and all Panamanians this new affront to the truth and our dignity as a nation,” he wrote. He accused Trump of “lying again.” Trump has talked about retaking the Panama Canal since his campaign, arguing that the U.S. should have never turned control over to the Panamanians and that the U.S. was being overcharged for using it. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Mulino in early February and insisted that China was exerting influence over the canal’s operations. The focus was the Chinese consortium running the ports. Panama rejected that China had any influence over canal operations. “Cooperation between our governments passes through clear understandings in terms of issues of mutual interest,” Mulino wrote. “It doesn’t have anything to do with ‘reclaiming the canal’ nor with tarnishing our national sovereignty.” In a filing, CK Hutchison Holding said Tuesday that it would sell all shares in Hutchison Port Holdings and in Hutchison Port Group Holdings to the BlackRock consortium in a deal valued at nearly $23 billion, including $5 billion in debt. The deal has to be approved by Panama’s government. The United States built the canal in the early 1900s as it looked for ways to facilitate the transit of commercial and military vessels between its coasts. Washington relinquished control of the waterway to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, under a treaty signed in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter. Trump has claimed that Carter “foolishly” gave the canal away. Frank Sixt, co-managing director of CK Hutchison, said in a statement that the transaction was “the result of a rapid, discrete but competitive process in which numerous bids and expressions of interest were received.” The next four years will change America forever.

Title: How has ‘public squalor’ become so normalised in our towns and cities?

Housing vacancy is again making headlines. Figures from GeoDirectory, which is a joint venture between Tailte Éireann and An Post, estimates the housing vacancy rate at 3.8 per cent or 81,449 houses. Census 2022 by the CSO calculated Ireland’s housing vacancy at more than 163,000 houses, or 7.7 per cent. Forty-eight thousand houses were vacant for more than five years and, again according to GeoDirectory, an additional 20,092 were derelict. We need some degree of vacancy to align sellers and buyers, and based on GeoDirectory figures we do not have a housing vacancy problem. A stroll through many of the State’s cities and towns, however, would suggest that this conclusion is perhaps optimistic. (Questions to GeoDirectory about the difference between its figures and CSO calculations went unanswered.) Last year architects Frank O’Connor and Jude Sherry recorded 700 empty properties within two kilometres of Cork city centre, about 70 per cent of which was housing. At the same time, there are 2,893 households on the Cork City social housing waiting list, or just 300 houses for sale if that is your preferred metric. “Dereliction eats away the urban fabric [and] wastes vital resources, makes areas look ugly and feel unsafe. So why has it been normalised and enabled by the State?” O’Connor asks. It is a fair question. A cultural aversion to interfering with what people do with their properties or even asking owners what they are doing with them is part of the problem. An assumption that property rights are non-negotiable and take precedence over the common good has also led to a propensity for people doing what they want with their property or nothing at all. There are penalties on buildings that end up on a council’s Derelict Sites Register, but their application nationally is sclerotic. At the end of 2023, Dublin City Council was owed €6.8 million in unpaid derelict buildings fines. Councils are also culprits themselves: “Chances are, in Dublin, if it has buddleia growing on it, it’s owned by the local authority,” Ciarán Cuffe, the former councillor and MEP, recently told the Dublin Inquirer. [ Derelict Victorian houses ‘crumbling’ six years after €700,000 purchase by Dublin City CouncilOpens in new window ] A “vacancy relief” for commercial rates for those with unoccupied shops and offices, including those above the shop, is also questionable. In France, nearly 3,700 towns have introduced a tax of 17 per cent of the rental value of a property empty for more than one year, rising to 34 per cent in year two. Here, as this newspaper’s recent series on Derelict Dublin showed, important and run-of-the-mill buildings lie vacant for decades to the point of dereliction and we pay little heed and often no penalties. As with a lot of Irish regulation, laissez-faire enforcement is the norm, and it just doesn’t work. Vacant and derelict buildings stem from market, policy and ideological failure. The result is unpleasant environments, and towns and villages dying for the want of inhabitants, at the same time as multiple buildings sit empty. Sometimes for reasons of affordability, sometimes because the town isn’t attractive – and sometimes just because of their own notions of grandeur – people build new houses outside towns and drive everywhere. Both practices are unsustainable. Legislation, policy or technical solutions can only do so much – in the end it is about the State as much as it is about individuals Attempts to beautify towns and woo back inhabitants to by improving the urban experience with more public seating, pedestrian crossings and wider footpaths, for example, often run into sand for one reason: councillors don’t want any parking removed. Yet research shows three things: walking, cycling and public realm improvements can increase retail sales by 30 per cent; Irish retailers overestimate the proportion of their customers who arrive by car to do their shopping and underestimate those who walk; and people who walk to the shops go there more often. A good public realm is a good business realm. In towns where the public realm has been improved, footfall and business has increased. See Blackrock, Co Dublin, or Virginia, Co Cavan, or Clonakilty, Co Cork. Ireland’s market towns in particular, the Strokestowns and Templemores with their wide streets, have huge potential for attractive urban realms to entice new families and business. Ireland’s capital exhibits the characteristics of both a shanty town and a beautiful town. The difference between Dublin and comparable international cities is that these characteristics often exist side-by-side on the same street, including its main thoroughfare; what Jude Sherry calls “public squalor”. Dublin city had more than 18,000 vacant residential units in Census 2022, with more than 5,000 of these recorded as available “for rent” (there were 34,000 nationwide). A lot of these are illegal short-term lets – the Airbnb phenomenon is another example of letting people do what they want with their property at the expense of wider society. There is now a new Bill to regulate short-terms lets. Buildings aside, the most memorable feature of good cities is the public transport system. Despite being open since December 2017, neither Cabra nor Phibsboro Luas stops have any public street signage. Look at the beautiful bus and metro stations in European cities – with actual signage. We get bus stops on the side of roads with not even a seat or shelter from the rain. In 2017, Fianna Fáil’s Barry Cowen brought forward a good vacant house refurbishment Bill. More recently, the Greens had something similar, but it lapsed with the election. There are refurbishment grants available for vacant and derelict housing, but these are paid retrospectively, reducing their usefulness. There has been limited progress on easing the conversion of vacant above-the-shop units with some exceptions – Waterford City and County Council has been doing good work via the Repair and Lease Scheme. Dereliction and vacancy – and our tolerance for both – are symptoms of a bigger problem: the low value we put on place. Unfortunately, as with road safety, there seems to be only so much legislation, policy or technical solutions can do. In the end it is an issue of attitude – of the State as much as of individuals. For a country allegedly obsessed with property we care surprisingly little for it, apart from its financial value of course. The engraving on 19th century engineer Thomas Drummond’s plinth in Dublin City Hall reads: “Property has its duties as well as its rights.” It should be imprinted on the deeds of every building in the country.

Title: Trump lays out bold vision for America in first joint session of Congress

The address was met with a mix of fervent applause and predictable jeers from Democrats, who have become the embodiment of obstructionism and defeatism in the face of Trumpâs bold agenda. From reclaiming the Panama Canal to cracking down on illegal immigration and vowing to plant the American flag on Mars, Trumpâs speech was a clarion call for a stronger, prouder, and more self-reliant America. Reclaiming the Panama Canal and securing Greenland One of the most striking moments of the speech came when Trump announced his administrationâs efforts to âreclaim the Panama Canalâ for the United States. âThe Panama Canal was built by Americans for Americans, not for others,â Trump declared, referencing reports that U.S. investment firm BlackRock is set to purchase the canalâs port infrastructure from its current Chinese owner. Trumpâs remarks underscored his unwavering commitment to restoring American control over strategic assets that have been mismanaged or exploited by foreign powers. âWe didnât give it to China. We gave it to Panama, and weâre taking it back,â he said, drawing thunderous applause from his supporters. The president also reignited his push to secure Greenland, a move that has long been a point of contention with Denmark. âThe people of Greenland deserve the right to determine their future,â Trump said, suggesting that the island could break away from Denmark and join the United States. âWe need Greenland, and we will secure it one way or the other,â he added, signaling his determination to expand American influence in the Arctic region. Ending the Ukraine conflict and restoring American diplomacy Trump also addressed the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, reiterating his commitment to ending what he called a âsenselessâ war. He criticized Democratic leaders, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, for their apparent willingness to prolong the conflict. âSome people would rather see this war drag on for another five years,â Trump said, taking a swipe at Warren, whom he derisively referred to as âPocahontas.â The president highlighted his administrationâs efforts to broker peace between Ukraine and Russia, emphasizing that fostering normal diplomatic relations with Moscow serves American interests. Despite recent tensions with Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, Trump announced that a minerals agreement between the U.S. and Ukraine was back on track, citing Zelenskyâs renewed commitment to peace and partnership. Cracking down on illegal immigration and ending wokism Domestically, Trump focused on his administrationâs achievements in border security and immigration enforcement. He invited several guests to Capitol Hill whose stories shine a light on the human cost of illegal immigration, including family members of crime victims targeted by undocumented immigrants and a Border Patrol agent injured in the line of duty. Trump also took aim at the cultural left, declaring an end to the âtyranny of so-called diversity, equity, and inclusion policies.â He called on Congress to criminalize âsex changes on children,â denouncing the idea that a child can be âtrapped in the wrong bodyâ as âa big lie.â His supporters cheered the move as a long-overdue measure to protect children from irreversible medical procedures. The president also defended his decision to reinstate the ban on transgender individuals serving in the military, stating, âOur soldiers wonât be activists and ideologues â they will be fighters and warriors.â Elon Musk, Mars, and the American spirit of innovation Trump reserved special praise for Elon Musk, whose leadership at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has uncovered billions in government waste and fraud. âElon Musk is a true American pioneer,â Trump said, celebrating Muskâs efforts to dismantle the ârule by unelected bureaucrats.â Looking to the future, Trump vowed that his second term would yield historic accomplishments, including the colonization of Mars. âWe are going to lead humanity into space and plant the American flag on the planet Mars and even far beyond,â he declared, echoing Muskâs vision for interplanetary exploration. Trumpâs speech was a powerful reminder of the resilience and determination that have defined America throughout its history. From reclaiming strategic assets to ending cultural divisiveness and pushing the boundaries of human achievement, Trumpâs vision for America is one of strength, pride, and boundless possibility. As the nation moves forward under Trumpâs leadership, the contrast between his bold agenda and the petulant obstructionism of the Democrats could not be clearer. While the left clings to its dogma of division and decline, Trumpâs America is rising, stronger and more united than ever. The road ahead is long, but with courage, common sense, and an unwavering commitment to the American spirit, the best is yet to come.

While the left clings to its dogma of division and decline, Trumpâs America is rising, stronger and more united than ever. The road ahead is long, but with courage, common sense, and an unwavering commitment to the American spirit, the best is yet to come. Sources include: RT.com RT.com Enoch, Brighteon.ai Reclaiming the Panama Canal and securing Greenland One of the most striking moments of the speech came when Trump announced his administrationâs efforts to âreclaim the Panama Canalâ for the United States. âThe Panama Canal was built by Americans for Americans, not for others,â Trump declared, referencing reports that U.S. investment firm BlackRock is set to purchase the canalâs port infrastructure from its current Chinese owner. Trumpâs remarks underscored his unwavering commitment to restoring American control over strategic assets that have been mismanaged or exploited by foreign powers. âWe didnât give it to China. We gave it to Panama, and weâre taking it back,â he said, drawing thunderous applause from his supporters. The president also reignited his push to secure Greenland, a move that has long been a point of contention with Denmark. âThe people of Greenland deserve the right to determine their future,â Trump said, suggesting that the island could break away from Denmark and join the United States. âWe need Greenland, and we will secure it one way or the other,â he added, signaling his determination to expand American influence in the Arctic region. Ending the Ukraine conflict and restoring American diplomacy Trump also addressed the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, reiterating his commitment to ending what he called a âsenselessâ war. He criticized Democratic leaders, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, for their apparent willingness to prolong the conflict. âSome people would rather see this war drag on for another five years,â Trump said, taking a swipe at Warren, whom he derisively referred to as âPocahontas.â The president highlighted his administrationâs efforts to broker peace between Ukraine and Russia, emphasizing that fostering normal diplomatic relations with Moscow serves American interests. Despite recent tensions with Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, Trump announced that a minerals agreement between the U.S. and Ukraine was back on track, citing Zelenskyâs renewed commitment to peace and partnership. Cracking down on illegal immigration and ending wokism Domestically, Trump focused on his administrationâs achievements in border security and immigration enforcement. He invited several guests to Capitol Hill whose stories shine a light on the human cost of illegal immigration, including family members of crime victims targeted by undocumented immigrants and a Border Patrol agent injured in the line of duty. Trump also took aim at the cultural left, declaring an end to the âtyranny of so-called diversity, equity, and inclusion policies.â He called on Congress to criminalize âsex changes on children,â denouncing the idea that a child can be âtrapped in the wrong bodyâ as âa big lie.â His supporters cheered the move as a long-overdue measure to protect children from irreversible medical procedures. The president also defended his decision to reinstate the ban on transgender individuals serving in the military, stating, âOur soldiers wonât be activists and ideologues â they will be fighters and warriors.â Elon Musk, Mars, and the American spirit of innovation Trump reserved special praise for Elon Musk, whose leadership at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has uncovered billions in government waste and fraud. âElon Musk is a true American pioneer,â Trump said, celebrating Muskâs efforts to dismantle the ârule by unelected bureaucrats.â Looking to the future, Trump vowed that his second term would yield historic accomplishments, including the colonization of Mars. âWe are going to lead humanity into space and plant the American flag on the planet Mars and even far beyond,â he declared, echoing Muskâs vision for interplanetary exploration. Trumpâs speech was a powerful reminder of the resilience and determination that have defined America throughout its history.

The Wyoming-incorporated tech firm released its Ethereum Strategy Whitepaper alongside the announcement, detailing its rationale behind choosing Ethereum over the more commonly adopted Bitcoin for corporate treasury management. "While Bitcoin remains a strong store of value, Ethereum provides broader utility as a programmable financial platform," the firm wrote on its Whitepaper, published Wednesday. BioNexus touts Ethereum's yield-generation capabilities through staking as a key advantage over Bitcoin, despite the latter’s adoption by institutional investors last year. "Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum provides an additional revenue stream through staking. Ethereum's Proof-of-Stake mechanism allows holders to generate 3-5% annual yield," the firm said in its Whitepaper, adding it could potentially turn Ethereum "from a passive asset into an income-generating treasury instrument." BioNexus points to Ethereum's institutional credibility as another factor, noting Ethereum's adoption by major financial entities such as BlackRock and Fidelity validates "its long-term potential as a financial instrument." "Our goal is to strategically position Ethereum as a core component of our treasury over time," BioNexus CEO Sam Tan told Decrypt in an emailed statement. "I can confirm that our Board’s approval provides flexibility. We intend to allocate a meaningful portion of our reserves to Ethereum." Tan declined to disclose an exact percentage for its Ethereum allocation "at this stage," but said the company's team has been "preparing for this shift for some time." "We’re currently weighing whether to operate our own validator nodes or partner with established third-party staking providers," Tan said. "Our choice will hinge on security, efficiency, and compliance, and we’ll finalize this as we scale our Ethereum holdings." The company also cites Ethereum's role in the global financial system, claiming the network "underpins trillions in stablecoin transactions annually, acting as the settlement layer for USDT, USDC, and other stablecoins." BioNexus’ Ethereum Strategy Whitepaper specifically references the upcoming Pectra protocol upgrade, which it sees as something that could reinforce Ethereum's stature "as a dependable long-term infrastructure for businesses." Despite the optimism, Pectra’s update has faced issues in recent weeks including during its Sepolia test network run early Wednesday, following similar roadblocks from its earlier Holesky testing phase. BioNexus operates primarily in Asia through its Malaysian subsidiary, working in genomic diagnostics and chemical distribution. Its provision of industrial chemical supplies for the automotive and aerospace sectors accounts for 90% of its total revenue. It has also developed RNA-based blood tests for early detection of cancers and inflammatory diseases, a segment that represents 10% of its revenue. But for all its prospects with Ethereum, BioNexus appears to be battling financial challenges of its own. In December last year, the company received a Nasdaq notice for non-compliance with the minimum $1 bid price rule.A temporary exception was granted, giving it until May 1, 2025, to regain compliance. To address this, BioNexus plans a reverse stock split by April 7, 2025. The company reported $9.26 million in trailing twelve-month revenue, over a $5.88 million market cap, with its stock trading at $0.32, down 61% on the year, data from the Financial Times shows.

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump pumps his fist as he steps from Air Force One upon his arrival in West Palm Beach, Florida, U.S., February 28, 2025. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque/File Photo By Lisa Baertlein LOS ANGELES, March 5 (Reuters) – U.S. President Donald Trump is drafting an executive order aimed at resuscitating domestic shipbuilding and reducing China’s grip on the $150 billion global ocean shipping industry and countering its rising naval power. A draft fact sheet seen by Reuters on Wednesday includes an 18-point plan that includes funding the effort with fees from imports arriving on Chinese-made ships. It would also establish a Maritime Security Trust Fund as a dedicated funding source and create shipbuilding incentives that include tax credits, grants and loans. “The White House is standing up an office at the National Security Council to lead a whole-of-government effort to strengthen the maritime industrial base,” the document said, following Trump’s announcement of the plans during an address to Congress on Tuesday. Republican and Democratic U.S. lawmakers for years have warned about China’s growing dominance on the seas and diminishing U.S. naval readiness. The pending executive order appears to be influenced by existing proposals, including legislation with bipartisan backing. Trump’s initiative comes two months after the Biden administration concluded a nearly year-long probe requested by the United Steelworkers and other unions, which concluded that China uses unfair policies and practices to dominate the sector. Michael Wessel, president of the Wessel Group, who helped coordinate that investigation under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, called Trump’s announcement an encouraging step forward after years of efforts by unions to revitalize the industry. “We can still be the industrial leaders of the world – but only if we act,” he said. “Now is the time for Trump to turn words into action and follow through on his commitments.” Mike Waltz, Trump’s national security adviser and a former House Republican from Florida, last year introduced a bill with Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly from Arizona to reinvigorate commercial and military shipbuilding in the United States. The U.S. Trade Representative’s office last month proposed charging up to $1.5 million for Chinese-built vessels entering U.S. ports as part of its probe of China’s growing domination of the global shipbuilding, maritime and logistics sectors. Trump on Tuesday hailed an unrelated deal led by U.S. firm BlackRock to buy most of the $22.8 billion ports business of Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison. The deal will give the U.S. consortium control of key Panama Canal ports amid White House calls to remove them from what it says is Chinese ownership. “My administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we’ve already started doing it,” Trump told the U.S. Congress. That BlackRock announcement followed last month’s reintroduction of bipartisan legislation that would require the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense to develop a strategy to monitor China’s efforts to build, buy, or own strategic ports. Other measures in the draft document would direct Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency to review government procurement processes, including at the U.S. Navy; increase wages for nuclear shipyard workers; and develop a security strategy for the Arctic.

Title: Canary Capital Files to Launch ETF Tracking Cross-Chain Protocol Axelar (AXL)

Time Published: 2025-03-05T22:17:35Z
Full Content:
Canary Capital, the digital asset-focused investment firm founded by former Valkyrie Funds co-founder Steven McClurg, is planning on launching an exchange-traded fund (ETF) tracking the price of Axelar (AXL). The firm submitted an S-1 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Wednesday, kicking off the process to launch such a fund. The hedge fund has previously filed paperwork for several other ETFs. Some of these have already been acknowledged by the Commission and await approval. "Axelar has one of the best dev teams in blockchain. Most viable protocols work with them on chain interoperability," said Steven McClurg, Chief Executive Officer at Canary Capital. "There is no question that AXL will be a top 20 token by market capitalization as the market discovers them. This is why we took the risk." AXL is the native token of the Alexar Network, a cross-chain protocol that connects other blockchains, enabling decentralized, secure cross-chain transactions. Unlike many interoperability solutions that rely on a small set of validators, Axelar operates on a proof-of-stake consensus model, allowing anyone to participate in its network, Sergey Gorbunov, co-founder of Axelar protocol, said in an interview with CoinDesk. The protocol, which has previously been integrated by J.P. Morgan’s Kinexys platform, Microsoft’s Azure marketplace as well as Uniswap and MetaMask, also announced the appointment of former Coinbase chief legal officer and Acting Comptroller of the Currency Brian Brooks to its newly formed Institutional Advisory Board. “Brian comes with a pretty deep understanding of how do you actually make sure blockchain is adopted by traditional finance,” said Gorbunov. “He understands what pain points these asset issuers have and he believes that decentralized interoperability is very essential to not introduce all of those issues in the process.” According to Gorbunov, stablecoins and tokenization are poised to be the next major trends for institutions in crypto, driven by regulatory developments and efficiency gains. A stablecoin bill expected in the coming months could open the door for more financial institutions to issue and integrate stablecoins, with firms like PayPal, BlackRock, and Robinhood already exploring their use for settlement to reduce costs. AXL currently trades at $0.36 and stands at a market cap of $340 million, according to CoinDesk data. The token reached an all-time high in March 2024 at $2.69 but has since dropped.

Title: Greenland, Panama fiercely reject Trump’s ambitions in address to Congress

President Donald Trump says the U.S. needs Greenland for national and international security during a joint address to Congress. Leaders from both Greenland and Panama issued messages on Wednesday fervently rejecting the comments made by President Donald Trump during his address to Congress in which he again reiterated his ambitions to grab hold of the strategically important areas. Trump has made clear he intends to "acquire" both Greenland and the Panama Canal, and previously refused to rule out military intervention to achieve his expansionist goals. In his joint address to Congress, the president said his administration had already taken steps to "take back" the Panama Canal and reiterated his push to acquire Greenland, which is currently a territory of Denmark. TRUMP SAYS AMERICA WOULD WELCOME GREENLAND DURING JOINT ADDRESS TO CONGRESS President Donald Trump addresses a joint session of Congress at the Capitol in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday. (Win McNamee/Getty Images) Trump spoke directly to Greenland in his address on Tuesday night and said, "We strongly support your right to determine your own future, and if you choose, we welcome you into the United States of America." "We will keep you safe. We will make you rich. And together we will take Greenland to heights like you have never thought possible before," he added. Trump then said his administration was "working with everybody involved to try to get it." "We need it really for international world security. And I think we’re going to get it," he continued. "One way or the other, we’re going to get it." Greenland Prime Minister Múte Egede on Wednesday made clear he is neither interested in American nor Danish ownership. "We do not want to be Americans, nor Danes, we are Kalaallit (Greenlanders). The Americans and their leader must understand that," Egede said in a post on Facebook translated by Reuters. "We are not for sale and cannot be taken. Our future is determined by us in Greenland," he added. Greenland Prime Minister Múte Egede, left, and President Donald Trump. (Getty Images | Fox News Digital) Trump’s comments regarding the Panama Canal on Tuesday night were just as direct when he said, "My administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal." "We've already started doing it," he added. Trump has claimed China has taken over the important waterway as a Hong Kong-based company operates ports on either end of the canal — which the administration has claimed could cut off the U.S. from the canal if Beijing directed it to. However, Panama has repeatedly rejected the claim that China runs the canal.

(Arnulfo Franco/AFP via Getty Images) "Just today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal and a couple of other canals," Trump said. Trump's comments were in reference to a $23 billion BlackRock Inc.-TiL Consortium deal made with Hutchison Port Holdings, the Hong Kong conglomerate, announced on Tuesday. The consortium, made up of BlackRock Inc., Global Infrastructure Partners and Terminal Investment Limited, would acquire "90% interests in Panama Ports Company (the "PPC Transaction"), which owns and operates the ports of Balboa and Cristobal in Panama," according to a Tuesday press release. But Panama’s president took issue with Trump’s comments saying in part, "Once again, President Trump, is lying."

"I reject, on behalf of Panama and all Panamanians, this new affront to the truth and to our dignity as a nation." "It has nothing to do with the ‘recovery of the Canal’ or with tarnishing our national sovereignty," he added. "The Canal is Panamanian and will continue to be Panamanian!"

Title: Panama president says Trump 'lying' about reclaiming canal

Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino on Wednesday accused his U.S. counterpart Donald Trump of "lying" about Washington taking back the Panama Canal. "Once again, President Trump is lying. The Panama Canal is not in the process of recovery," Mulino wrote on X. "I reject, on behalf of Panama and all Panamanians, this new affront to the truth and to our dignity as a nation," Mulino added, after Trump said that his administration had started to take back the vital waterway. "To further enhance our national security, my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we've already started doing it," Trump said in a speech to Congress Tuesday. "We're taking it back." Under mounting pressure from Washington, Hong Kong firm Hutchison said Tuesday it had agreed to sell its lucrative Panama Canal ports to a U.S.-led consortium. CK Hutchison Holdings said it would offload a 90-percent stake in the Panama Ports Company (PPC) and sell a slew of other non-Chinese ports to a group led by asset manager BlackRock. The sellers will receive $19 billion in cash, the company said. Hutchison subsidiary PPC has for decades run ports at Balboa and Cristobal on the Pacific and Atlantic ends of the interoceanic waterway. But since taking office in January, Trump has complained that China controls the canal -- a vital strategic asset that the United States once ran. He has refused to rule out a military invasion of Panama to regain control, sparking angry protests and a complaint to the United Nations by the Central American nation. Since 1999, the canal has been run by the Panama Canal Authority (ACP) -- an autonomous entity whose board of directors is appointed by Panama's president and National Assembly. The 80-kilometer-long canal handles five percent of global maritime trade, and 40 percent of U.S. container traffic. Beijing has consistently denied interfering in the canal. Innovate through Art "Once again, President Trump is lying. The Panama Canal is not in the process of recovery," Just let him sharpie it in on a map. He’ll then find something else dumb to keep busy about and hopefully out of trouble. Little Duce won't be able to put his dirty hands on the canal... The canal is and will be from Panama.. So, the sale from a Chinese company to a US company didn't occur precisely because of what Trump has been saying about the issue? Of, course it has. Rubio went down there to deliver the ultimatum and then hey presto - it happened. Seems like a fairly clear sequence of events actually. The Panama Canal is owned by Panama. President Jose Raul Mulino is 100% correct. Trump is a known, proven, liar and felon. Why anyone believes anything he says confuses me. Use your Facebook account to login or register with JapanToday.

Title: Add the teachers' union to the list of investors worried about Tesla's sliding stock

Volatility in the price of Tesla stock is sparking anxiety beyond Wall Street. Now, a union of 1.8 million teachers is expressing concern about further declines from its sky-high valuation. The American Federation of Teachers has openly questioned Tesla's valuation, urging top asset managers to review investments in the electric vehicle maker. In letters sent to asset managers including BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street, the AFT warned that Tesla's market decline poses a considerable risk to teacher pensions, which have an estimated $4 trillion of members' deferred wages invested, AFT President Randi Weingarten said. The union argued that Tesla stock's aggressive tumble is a growing threat to teachers' retirement funds. The shares are down 42.5% from a mid-December peak, and At $275 per share, they're trading nearly at pre-election levels. "I'm asking the experts, because frankly, if the stock all of a sudden goes down even more precipitously than it has, and tens of billions of dollars are invested in it, then how do you create the replacement income in terms of these retirements?" Weingarten told Yahoo Finance on Monday. At least one of the letters cites a projected price target of $135 for Tesla stock, quoting recent JPMorgan commentary that the shares are "completely divorced" of fundamentals. But the fundamentals themselves are also driving the union's skittishness. "Tesla's latest financial disclosures should raise alarms," the letter said, citing a 23% profit decline and 71% revenue drop year-over-year. Regarding missed fourth-quarter margin expectations, it added, "These are not isolated incidents but rather a troubling pattern that suggests Tesla's pricing power is eroding, leaving it vulnerable to market fluctuations and increased competition." Recent weeks have fuelled the bear case for Tesla, as data from China and Europe reveal declining sales of the company's EVs and heightened competition. According to the German Federal Motor Transport Authority, sales in Germany plummeted 76% in February. Such trends have caught the attention of other investors as well. Ross Gerber, a Tesla-believer-turned-bear, now expects the stock to see even more pain in 2025. While he remains a shareholder, he told Business Insider that he's whittled down his firm's position and he's pessimistic about Tesla's premium valuation. Other bears have also warned about a steep sell-off to come. Earlier this year, Roth MKM analyst Craig Irwin suggested that AI hype has severely overvalued the company, which is why Tesla stock will fall 70% to $85 a share. Weingarten emphasized that the AFT's letters to asset managers were not political, and noted that the union has a history of publishing reports about financial concerns. According to Weingarten, the union has been behind legal action against the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency, due to actions it has taken against the Department of Education. Jump to

Title: Here's what Trump's tariff barrage could mean for your 401(k) plan

Watch CBS News By Aimee Picchi Edited By Alain Sherter Updated on: March 5, 2025 / 4:03 PM EST / CBS News During his Tuesday night address to Congress, President Trump acknowledged his barrage of tariffs might cause "a little disturbance." But with the stock market tumbling this week in reaction to his import duties, workers with 401(k) plans may wonder about how much that disturbance could affect their retirement savings. The S&P 500 has lost about 3% of its value since Friday, with Wall Street tumbling on Monday and Tuesday after Mr. Trump decided to move forward with 25% tariffs on nearly all goods imported from Mexico and Canada, and an additional 10% on Chinese imports. The stock index regained some ground on Wednesday, rising 21 points, or 0.4%, to 5,799 in afternoon trading. According to Wall Street analysts, the market reaction reflects investor concerns that a trade war could crimp U.S. economic growth and reignite inflation, putting pressure on U.S. consumers who are already financially strained after grappling with several years of elevated price increases. Some recent economic data also points to souring outlooks from consumers and businesses, with both groups now expecting higher inflation in the face of Mr. Trump's new tariffs. With uncertainty on the rise, employees exposed to stocks through their retirement plans should brace for more investment volatility, experts say. "There is evidence that a cooling in the economy is underway," Adam Crisafulli, an analyst and founder of Vital Knowledge, told CBS MoneyWatch. "U.S. equities are bearing the brunt of what we're seeing in the U.S. economy right now." The Trump administration has also sometimes sent mixed messages about its tariff plans, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Tuesday night saying the administration might "modify the tariffs somewhat." Those mixed signals add to the challenges facing businesses in deciding their strategy, experts say. Because tariffs are paid by U.S. businesses on goods they import from other nations, some companies are uncertain about the costs they'll face moving forward under the Trump administration, Crisafulli said. "I look at tariffs as a corporate tax," he said. "Imagine if corporate tax rates were set in this chaotic of a fashion — it would create a lot of hesitation among companies. They don't know what the ground rules will be." Walmart executives, noting that the U.S. is entering what they characterized as "an uncertain time," said last month that consumers are paring their spending, while Target on Tuesday said costs from tariffs could put "meaningful pressure" on the retailer's profits. Such caution is also fueling market volatility, experts said. "Uncertainty around the scope and implementation of tariffs is high," investment firm BlackRock said in a March 5 note to investors. "In markets, we think U.S. equities could come under pressure in the next few months as investors seek additional compensation for these risks." While investors spooked by the roller-coaster stock swings might be tempted to exit the market, that's generally a losing strategy, Crisafulli said. Timing the market, or attempting to buy and sell stocks to capture gains and avoid losses, is almost impossible to execute and typically leads to financial losses and lost opportunities, Charles Schwab research has found. The strategy is almost always doomed to fail because investors don't know when to get back into the market to capture the rebound, while the stock market has historically always recovered even from major setbacks. For instance, investors who sold during the March 2020 rout that followed the eruption of COVID-19 around the U.S. and failed to re-enter the market that year could have missed out on the rebound, with the S&P 500 gaining 15% by the end of December. For most investors with a 401(k) plan, sticking tight and avoiding checking your balance each day may be the best strategy for coping with volatile periods, experts say. "Your 401(k) should be on autopilot, and you don't look at day-to-day volatility," Crisafulli said. "I don't think people should make dramatic changes with their 401(k)s." Still, investors may want to examine their asset allocation and shift to investments that could provide more protection in the face of a possible global trade war, researchers note. For instance, automobile companies could be hard-hit by the Trump administration's tariffs, BlackRock notes, given that U.S. automakers import many components from Mexico and Canada. Restaurants and grocery companies could also feel the impact of the new tariffs, as U.S. food costs could increase by 3% due to the higher import duties, BlackRock noted. "On the other hand, financials and health care services may be relatively insulated, since these sectors have minimal exposure to imported goods," the wealth management firm noted. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump vowed that his tariffs "are about making America rich again and making America great again." Some of his goals in implementing the tariffs are to bring about a resurgence in U.S. manufacturing by convincing companies to move factories to the U.S. While that could take months or even years to pan out, investment experts say it's also important to keep a long-term view on the U.S. economy. "It may be hard for investors to believe, but there is more to market volatility than reacting to the latest Trump executive action," Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street, wrote in a new report. Despite recent data that suggests the U.S. economy is slowing, "an economic growth scare is not the same thing as a recession. And the economic environment remains respectable. U.S. real GDP is likely to expand in the first quarter," he added. Given that the economy is continuing to grow, the labor market remains strong and inflation is still cooling, it's important to "differentiate between signal and noise," Arone said. "And, rightly or wrongly, the Trump administration uses the economy and stock market as barometers for its success," he added. "They won't purposefully harm the economy or the bull market."

Title: BlackRock Agrees to Buy Panama Canal Ports as Trump Continues Threats

BlackRock, America’s largest asset manager which handles over $11 trillion in assets, has agreed to purchase two ports on either end of the Panama Canal. BlackRock is buying the ports from Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison in a deal worth about $22.8 billion. The announcement of the deal comes as President Donald Trump has made threats against Panama over China’s involvement in the canal. The president has said the U.S. never should’ve handed over control of the canal in the 1970s after building the canal in the early 20th century. And Trump has even suggested the canal would be taken by force in necessary. Trump boasted in an address to Congress on Tuesday night that the U.S. was “reclaiming the Panama Canal,” without giving details about who was actually buying the ports there. “Just today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal and a couple of other canals,” Trump said. The part he left out? BlackRock is doing the buying, a company that’s not too popular with Trump’s base. The far-right often casts BlackRock as part of a “globalist” cabal controlling the world, commentary that often surfaces anti-semitic memes about Trump’s business connections. “It was given away by the Carter administration for one dollar, but that agreement has been violated very severely,” Trump said, referring to the 1970s hand-off. “We didn’t give it to China. We gave it to Panama and we’re taking it back.” As CNN notes, the BlackRock deal also includes interests in 199 other berths in 23 countries, though none of those ports have the same geopolitical tensions as the Panama Canal right now. The co-managing director of CK Hutchinson, Frank Sixt, said in a statement posted online that the deal was the result of a “rapid, discrete but competitive process in which numerous bids and expressions of interest were received.” Sixt went on to describe the deal as “compelling” but insisted it had nothing to do with the current geopolitical tensions between the U.S., China, and Panama. “I would like to stress that the Transaction is purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama Ports,” Sixt insisted. “It must be noted that, however, the Transaction does remain subject to confirmatory due diligence, settlement of definitive documentations, and normal and usual completion procedures, adjustments and conditions as well as compliance by HPH with the rights of minority shareholders under existing shareholders agreements relating to the Sold HPH Interests.” Blackrock CEO Larry Fink said in a press release posted online by CK Hutchison that he was “thrilled” about the investment. “This agreement is a powerful illustration of BlackRock and GIPâs combined platform and our ability to deliver differentiated investments for clients,” Fink said. “These world-class ports facilitate global growth. Through our deep connectivity to organizations like Hutchison and MSC/TIL and governments around the world, we are increasingly the first call for partners seeking patient, long-term capital. We are thrilled our clients can participate in this investment.â Will BlackRock’s purchase of two ports at the Panama Canal be enough to please Trump and stop him from threatening the country with military invasion? That part isn’t clear yet. But even if it is, Trump still has plenty of other allies he wants to invade, including Greenland, Mexico, and Canada.

Panama President José Raúl Mulino on Wednesday accused President Trump of lying when he said in his address to Congress that his administration was "reclaiming" the Panama Canal.

Panama President José Raúl Mulino has accused U.S. President Donald Trump of lying when Trump said in his address to Congress the night before that his administration was “reclaiming” the Panama Canal PANAMA CITY -- Panama President José Raúl Mulino on Wednesday accused U.S. President Donald Trump of lying when he said in his address to Congress that his administration was “reclaiming” the Panama Canal.

The deal has to be approved by Panama’s government. The United States built the canal in the early 1900s as it looked for ways to facilitate the transit of commercial and military vessels between its coasts.

Title: Panama President Mulino: Trump's Canal Remarks Are an 'Affront to the Truth and Our Dignity as a Nation'

President of Panama José Raúl Mulino on Wednesday morning accused President Donald Trump of “lying again” after Trump reiterated his call to take back control of the Panama Canal in a speech to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night. “Once again, President Trump is lying. The Panama Canal is not in the process of recovery and much less is the task that in our conversations with Secretary Rubio or any other has even been discussed,” Mulino said on social media. “On behalf of Panama and all Panamanians, I reject this new affront to the truth and to our dignity as a nation.” “Cooperation between our governments is based on clear understandings on issues of mutual interest, as we have been doing. Nothing has to do either with the ‘recovery of the Canal’ or with sullying our national sovereignty,” he continued. “The Canal is Panamanian and will remain Panamanian!” Trump, during his speech to Congress, said that to enhance national security, the United States will reclaim the Panama Canal and declared “we’ve already started doing it.” He referred to a deal announced hours before the speech between Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings Limited and asset manager BlackRock for the purchase of a majority stake of Panama Ports Company, a Hutchison subsidiary that, since 1997, has administered two ports located at opposite ends of the Panama Canal. “Just today a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal and a couple other canals,” President Trump said. “The Panama Canal was built by Americans for Americans, not for others. But others could use it.” In December, Trump started a debate over the Panama Canal, an interoceanic trade route built by the United States in 1914 and whose control was handed over to Panama in 1999. The canal left American possession under an agreement signed by both nations during the administration of former U.S. President Jimmy Carter in 1977. Trump has repeatedly expressed that the United States should take back control of the Canal due to the “exorbitant” transit fees imposed on U.S. ships. Increasing U.S. stakes in the canal’s operations could forestall China’s growing influence over the important trade route. “It was given away by the Carter administration for $1. But that agreement has been violated very severely. We didn’t give it to China, we gave it to Panama, and we’re taking it back,” President Trump said on Tuesday. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian refuted President Trump’s statements in remarks during his regular briefing on Wednesday. “On the Panama Canal issue, China supports Panama’s sovereignty over the Canal, and stays committed to maintaining the status of the Canal as a permanently neutral international waterway,” Lin said. “China has never engaged in the management and operation of the Canal. Never ever have we interfered. The so-called China’s control over the Canal is nothing but a lie.” The Chinese spokesman asserted that he had “no comment” on the deal between Hutchison and BlackRock, but asserted that China supports Chinese companies, “including” those from Hong Kong, which must abide by Chinese law after the Chinese communist regime ended the “One Country, Two Systems” policy in 2020. “Hope they can have access to a fair and just business environment everywhere they go. We oppose any abuse of coercion and pressuring in international trade and economic relations,” Lin said. The ongoing debate over the Panama Canal has seen several Panamanian and Chinese government officials dismiss President Trump’s claims of Chinese influence in the trade route and calls to have the United States take back control of it. In February, the Chinese embassy in Panama claimed that the accusations made by the United States over Chinese influence in the canal were a “pure lie.” The comment was in response to the then-ongoing two-day visit of United States Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) Commander Adm. Alvin Holsey to the Central American nation. Holsey met with several Panamanian government officials to discuss topics including safeguarding the Panama Canal area from “Chinese Communist Party influence and control.” President Mulino, in a social media post, referred to Adm. Holsey’s visit by stating that the bilateral agenda with the United States is important and relevant — but stressed that, for Panama, it does not involve analyzing “situations that are not true.” President Mulino has repeatedly dismissed any possible negotiations pertaining to returning control of the Panama Canal to the United States, asserting that the trade route will remain fully under Panamanian control. Mulino, after stating that he would wait for President Trump to take office on January 20 before issuing any kind of official response, issued a formal letter to United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres hours after President Trump took office, expressing his “concerns” over Trump’s calls to retake control of the Panama Canal.

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Ryan Breslow is once again the CEO of Bolt, the fintech company told TechCrunch on Wednesday. Bolt shared a communication that recently went out to investors in which Breslow wrote that “following a challenging few years,” he had been reinstated as Bolt’s CEO with “unanimous approval” of the board of the one-click checkout company. Justin Grooms, who has served as interim CEO since last March, will now serve as president of Bolt. Grooms, the company’s former director of sales, took over as CEO after Maju Kuruvilla was reportedly removed by Bolt’s board. Breslow, the outspoken founder of Bolt, stepped down as CEO in early 2022. Over the years, he has faced allegations that he misled investors and violated security laws by inflating metrics while fundraising the last time he ran the company. Breslow was also embroiled in a legal battle with investor Activant Capital over a $30 million loan he took out. Last September, Bolt shared that it had reached a settlement with Activant Capital. That settlement stipulated that Bolt would repurchase Activant’s shares of Bolt stock, after which Activant would no longer hold any interest in the company. In the communication to investors, as seen by TechCrunch, Breslow thanked the company’s backers for their “support and encouragement” and expressed gratitude to employees. Last year, Bolt was reportedly trying to raise $200 million in equity and an unusual, additional $250 million in “marketing credits,” at a $14 billion valuation. As part of the funding round, Breslow would be re-instated as CEO. By September that deal had apparently stalled. Today, Bolt told TechCrunch that it could not comment on the fundraise. Bolt’s annualized run rate was at $28 million in revenue and the company had $7 million in gross profit as of the end of March of 2024, journalist Eric Newcomer, who also saw copies of the leaked term sheet, reported last August. A valuation of $14 billion would be an enormous multiple over such numbers and higher than that $11 billion valuation achieved in January of 2022. Bolt, which provides software to retailers to speed up checkout, raised around $1 billion in total venture-backed funding and at one time was valued at $11 billion. Investors include funds and accounts managed by BlackRock, Schonfeld, Invus Opportunities, CreditEase, H.I.G. Growth, and Moore Strategic Ventures, among others.
