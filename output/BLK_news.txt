BlackRock executive Rick Rieder reportedly thinks the U.S. Federal Reserve could slash rates by 50 basis points in September. Rieder, the asset management giant’s chief investment officer of global fixed income, said in a note to clients that Friday’s tepid jobs report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics could convince the Fed to institute a larger cut than expected, according to a new report from CNBC. “If slack in the labor force builds at all, or we continue to see a below 100,000 jobs hiring rate persistently, we would expect the Fed to start moving rates lower, and a 50-basis point cut in September might be possible depending on how the data evolves.” The new labor report indicated total nonfarm payroll employment increased by 73,000 jobs in July, less than the Dow Jones estimate of 100,000. The CME FedWatch Tool, which generates probabilities using the 30-day Fed Funds futures prices, estimates there’s an 80.3% chance the Fed will cut the federal target rate by 25 basis points at the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in September, up from 37.7% on Thursday. However, the tool currently estimates there’s zero chance of a 50-basis-point cut. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a press conference this week that no decisions have been made about September’s potential policy choices.

Title: Reasons to love Dublin right now: 52 of our favourite things about the city
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/life-style/people/2025/08/02/reasons-to-love-dublin-right-now-52-of-our-favourite-things-about-the-city/

Full Content:
Louis McNeice nailed it eight decades ago when he immortalised our capital city in his poem Dublin: “But yet she holds my mind/With her seedy elegance ... The glamour of her squalor, The bravado of her talk.” Ah, Dublin. The seedily-elegant city gets an awfully hard time these days. The housing crisis looms large, as do the apart-hotels springing up everywhere, not to forget the dilapidation that has always dogged our dirty old town. For years each winter, New York magazine has celebrated that city with its Reasons to Love New York Right Now edition. Inspired by them, we’re celebrating all that is great about Dublin. We know she has plenty of problems (scarlet for you, Temple Bar) but when we asked our contributors for examples of all that is brilliant right now about the capital we couldn’t hold them back: cultural happenings, community activism, remarkable watering holes, diverse food offerings and absurdities such as a few cherry tomatoes on a bridge becoming a bona-fide tourist attraction. We’re not blind to the city’s shortcomings (or overpriced pints) but what follows is a celebration of the capital in all her current glory. The magic, the mischief and the unexpected moments that make Dublin one of the best little towns in the world. So here are some of the many reasons why we love Dublin right now ... (With thanks to Róisín Ingle, Corinna Hardgrave, Una Mullally, Roe McDermott, Olivia Kelly, Conor Pope, Emer McLysaght, Deirdre McQuillan, Sorcha Pollak, Conor Capplis, Rebecca Daly, Niamh Browne, Joanne Cronin, Malachy Clerkin, Madeleine Lyons, Laura Slattery, Cathal O’Gara, Gemma Tipton and Ella Sloane). Because the Hacienda is holding out against gentrification. Shay is one of Dublin’s most beloved publicans. Always sporting an untied bow tie hung over a jazzy waistcoat and shirt, along with his signature coloured glasses, perhaps his greatest contemporary achievement is buttressing a unique bar from TikTok-loving tourists who confuse character with content. The pub – its exterior mimics a traditional Spanish cottage – has been there for decades in the market area between Capel Street and Smithfield. After you buzz the “bar” bell, and Shay cracks the iron-gated door, gives you the once over, and – if you’re lucky, or a regular – grants entry, inside you’ll find a magical pub stuck in time, with its nautical theme, pool tables, and a jukebox that always reverts to The Eagles. Intimate and lively, quaint and fun, it is also beloved by visiting artists looking for a down-to-earth spot to grab a pint, or to celebrate film premieres and arena tours (Taylor Swift booked it out for the after-party following her trio of concerts at the Aviva Stadium last summer). Sure, you can have a star on Hollywood Boulevard, but everyone knows that a framed photograph of you next to Shay on the wall of the Haci is the sign you’ve really made it. Now surrounded by apart-hotels, The Hacienda represents a space and attitude holding out against the homogenous corporate gentrification of the city. ... and the Cobblestone lives on. One of the great people’s victories in Dublin in recent years was the success of the Cobblestone protest. The pub – a bastion of traditional music, song, dance, and the Irish language – was threatened with a hotel development in 2021. Artists and audiences alike sprang into action, holding protests in Smithfield and at the headquarters of Dublin City Council. Planning permission ultimately refused; culture was one of the reasons cited. The energy of this successful protest speaks to the thriving traditional music scene in the city, from which many brilliant, boundary-pushing contemporary acts have emerged. Away from the din of amplified tourist-baiting live music in Temple Bar, you’ll still find authentic sessions in pubs across the city, and core to those is the Cobblestone. Because the Chamomile Club is proving Dublin can still be an exciting place for young artists. One of the most exciting collectives to come out of the city in recent years, the Chamomile Club encompasses parties, club nights, and music releases, featuring some of Ireland’s most exciting acts, including Monjola, Moio, and Aby Coulibaly. From block parties on Fade Street to garden parties at Orlagh House, and events at The Workman’s Club, The Complex, or other “secret locations”, their line-ups, design, and all-round energy is elevated and exciting. Other Dublin collectives, spaces and bands with a radical spirit include Dublin Digital Radio, Unit 44, and Bricknasty. Dublin is an expensive place to live, underserved with cultural spaces, and bigger cities are always calling. Yet these young artists and collectives are holding firm and inspiring others. Because the IFI and the Lighthouse are churches for film nerds. The seats are comfy, the coffee’s good, the staff are all delightful film nerds, and the foyers feel like somewhere you might accidentally meet the love of your life. Arthouse cinema in Dublin is alive and well, with the IFI hosting the Family Film Festival this August, while the Lighthouse’s programme is packed with the best new films as well as special screenings of classics like In The Mood For Love and Stanley Kubrick’s Barry Lyndon. Events like Cinema Book Club, GAZE and regular Q & As with writers and directors make these cinemas cultural hubs where no one will judge you for crying at a documentary about sheep. And if they do, they’re in the wrong cinema. Because pottery fever is catching in the Liberties. Nestled away on Mill Street in the Liberties, you’ll find a clay haven. Throwing Shapes is “the equivalent of Ballymaloe, but for clay,” says its founder Síofra Murdock, a ceramicist from Co Down who is as cheery and colourful as the pieces on display in her studio. Curious passersby can’t help but peer through the giant windows, plastered with bold red lettering – “Your Community Ceramics Studio” – to see what’s going on. It’s a hub of activity, hosting workshops, talks and markets that attract queues down the street. The shelves are lined with hundreds of creations, decorative and functional, at varying degrees of completion – some already fired and glazed, others still blank canvases. Having just celebrated its first birthday in May, the magnetic force of the studio grows stronger by the week. One member has even packed up and moved house to have the pottery wheels within arm’s reach. Murdock has hand-built a thriving clay community. Come and get your hands dirty. Because a Dublin storytelling event has gone global. Seanchoíche is a pop-up story telling night which encourages speakers to share personal anecdotes, prose, monologues, and spoken word. It gets its name from an amalgamation of seanchaíthe (the Irish for storytellers) and oíche (the Irish for night). The event, conceived in the Unesco city of literature, now runs in Belfast, Limerick, London, Amsterdam, Sydney, Melbourne. The night recently ran a slot on the Greenpeace Stage at Glastonbury – and if it’s cool enough for Glasto, it’s cool enough for us. Because the Silent Book Club at Mish Mash Café is a balm for the overstimulated brain. Silent Book Club comes with no pressure, no awkward icebreakers, no demands. Just turn up, order a coffee, read your book. For an hour or two, people sit in a hush that feels unusually generous – alone, together. The only thing you have to bring is a book and maybe the unspoken hope that the world can still make space for quiet, slow, communal moments. For introverts, it’s heaven. For everyone else, it’s an excellent excuse to finally read that novel. Because it’s brilliant for live music. From blockbuster headliners like Taylor Swift at the Aviva and Bruce Springsteen at Croke Park, to up-and-coming Irish talent taking to the stage in the Academy or international indie acts playing the Olympia, Dublin easily pulls the live music weight of a city three times its size. It’s not just the venues themselves that are special, but festivals such as Kilmainham’s Forbidden Fruit and In The Meadows, to the propulsive dance beats of Longitude in Marlay Park. Catch emerging acts at smaller festivals like Whelan’s We’ve Only Just Begun and Workman’s Next Big Thing. Because we have the greatest (art) show on earth for free. In other capital cities people line up to pay admission to art galleries. In Dublin you can see Caravaggio, Vermeer (one of only 34 in the whole world) and more for absolutely nothing at the National Gallery. Or wander into the Hugh Lane, for their heart-soothing Impressionist collection, alongside the world-famous Francis Bacon Studio. Right now, Ailbhe Ní Bhriain’s hauntingly beautiful Dream Pool Intervals is on show there too, ending September 28th. Because our contemporary art museum is so much more. An art gallery you can do yoga at? Tick. Not only does the Irish Museum of Modern Art have a collection that’s jam packed with goodies (Daphne Wright, Dorothy Cross, Alice Maher – and that’s just for starters), their summer programme adds drop in yoga in the formal gardens on Wednesday lunchtimes and Thursday evenings all summer long. Add outdoor art films on Living Canvas, coffee in the courtyard, music and free workshops to get your arty buzz on and find out more at imma.ie. Did someone say art is stuffy, formal and elitist? Not in Dublin. Because a few cherry tomatoes on a bridge can turn into a tourist attraction. Nobody knows who started it. Nobody cares. What began last January as a few cherry tomatoes frozen during a cold snap on Binns Bridge in Drumcondra evolved into an unlikely tourist attraction. On Google Maps, it was known as “the Shrine of the Sacred Cherry Tomatoes of Drumcondra”. Locals and tourists flocked to pay homage with ketchup sachets, basil bouquets and, in one high-art twist, AI-generated portraits of tomatoes in tuxedos. Influencers filmed it. Poets wrote tomato-based tributes. The bridge, inevitably, got millions of views on TikTok. A tourist from Zimbabwe told one newspaper that while he’d been to see the Phoenix Park “so far my favourite thing is the Cherry Tomato Bridge”. “Rotten tomatoes,” complained the critics. “Salad days,” countered the fans. Either way, it captured something ephemeral about the communal absurdity to be found in Dublin. Dublin City Council Spoilsports Department were quick to clean it all up, but we’ll always have the memories. Because Dublin pub quizzes are the best craic. Every night of the week in Dublin there’s a Quizteam Aguilera or a Trivia Newton John vying for glory in the great leveller of social activities, the pub quiz. A good team name is almost more important than how you do. From The Woolshed on Parnell Street to Dudley’s on Thomas Street you’ll get more old favourites like Quiz Quiztofferson and Universally Challenged, along with some more local flavour like Let Quizty Take It or A Tráth Called Ceist. The weekly Wednesday quiz at The Circular in Rialto often sells out and combines friendly vibes, at least four dog mascots, and healthy rivalry between returning teams and newbies alike. Losers get whatever the host Colin McKeown bought earlier in the shop across the road, so even if the scores plummet there might be a Toffee Crisp in it for you. Colin runs Quiz Host Ireland and says it’s community that brings people back again and again: “Simply that we gather together and join a bigger group”. His favourite team name ever? “Padraig Pearsed Nipples.” Because sound Dubs still play along with the Viking Splash Tour. Those giant yellow second World War era amphibious vehicles trundle around the city, spitting facts about Dúbh Linn and pointing out that the Pepper Canister Church is so-called because it ... looks like a pepper canister. The favourite activity of the Viking Splash is creeping up on unsuspecting pedestrians to roar at them. It is the best of sports who pretends not to see them coming and then gets a “big fright” followed by a wave to all the marauders on-board. The Viking Splash has become so beloved in Dublin that when it appeared back on the streets after the Covid lockdowns it was taken as a positive sign that the city was healing. Spare a thought though for those who live or work along the route. It can’t be easy hearing those impassioned “aarrgghhs!” multiple times a day. Because soon you’ll be able to make free phone calls from a retro phone box in the Little Museum of Dublin. Newly reopened in its original home in a Georgian town house on the northside of St Stephen’s Green, the back yard of the Little Museum of Dublin will shortly be home to an old-school cream and green phone box. Once a familiar sight on Parkgate Street and later Dawson Street, the K1 phone kiosk is one of only two examples of this iconic phone box still left – the other is in Foxrock village where it’s a decorative suburban quirk that also houses a well-used book exchange. When the phone box lands in the museum in August it will become the only functioning K1 phone kiosk in the State. After a restoration project, Eir has donated the kiosk to the Little Museum ensuring that this piece of telecommunications heritage is safeguarded for future generations. Soon visitors to the museum will be able to experience the unique phone box and even, thanks again to Eir, make phone calls anywhere in Ireland for free. Because Dublin Zoo now has animatronic dinosaurs. The affection Ireland has for Dublin Zoo was evident in the concern many felt last summer when illness struck the elephant herd leaving two of the beloved beasts dead. It was also on display at the height of the Covid pandemic when people dug deep to fund food for the animals when the zoo was on its knees after months of lockdown. The zoo in 2025 is almost entirely unrecognisable from the one conceived in the Rotunda Hospital in 1830 when a group of medics and scientists formed the Zoological Society of Ireland. Back then it was largely for the entertainment of wealthy Dubliners, with the entrance fee set at a hefty six pence – or nearly €100 in today’s money. Sundays were for normal people – as long as they could afford to spend a single penny. Now spread over 28 hectares, the zoo attracts more than 1 million visitors a year as Ireland’s largest family attraction. And a day at the zoo got even better earlier this year when the 700 animals were joined by animatronic dinosaurs. Because Trinity College is an oasis in the bustling capital Right bang in the city centre you can step away from the busy streets into a 430-year-old college that is an oasis of tranquillity and architectural beauty. On a summer’s day you can even walk past the playing fields to the Pavilion Bar and sit on the steps outside watching the cricket (no understanding of the rules required). Because our seagulls think they own the place. They look down on us, they threaten our sandwiches, they play havoc with rubbish bags and poo on our cars. They cackle, they chortle, they screech and scream and yet Dublin wouldn’t be Dublin without seagulls. Bloom feeds them in Ulysses, one of several notable references to the birds in James Joyce’s novel. Dublin has the densest urban gull population in Ireland; they’ve been nesting in the city since the 1970s due to declining food sources at sea and closure of landfills – now estimated to number around 10,000 breeding pairs. Yet, despite this rise, the overall herring gull population in Ireland has dropped by 90 per cent in the past 30-40 years. As they tell us what we have done to our environment – and theirs – we should look up to them. Because the clip-clop of horses is still the soundscape of the inner city. Many cities have horse and carriage tours for tourists, but in Dublin, this goes much deeper. Caring for horses is an intrinsic part of the city’s culture – as well as Traveller culture – to this day. Around Dublin 7 and 8, it’s not uncommon to see young people walking horses through the streets, or trotting on sulkies. Concerns are often raised over animal welfare and the future of the Smithfield horse fair. But talk to a kid in the city with a horse by their side, and they’ll furnish you with plenty of details about the horse’s personality and how they care for them. If only the city could contribute more to enhancing the care of horses by providing new funding for stables, and acknowledging that this culture should be protected and supported with animal welfare as a priority. Because Dubliners can talk to anyone. There’s a particular magic in the Dubliner’s ability to talk absolute nonsense – and mean it. Not just weather chat, but miniature theatre: timing, wit, warmth. Whether it’s the butcher, the barista, or the person beside you on the 13, you’ll get a comment, a joke, a “will you look at that state of the sky”. It’s not meaningless – it’s micro-connection. People who deride the power of small talk are unaware of its important psychological benefits. Small talk – particularly those small chats you have with people you see regularly such as shopkeepers and regulars on your bus route – has been proven to promote a greater sense of safety, belonging and community. It’s not a coincidence that we are discussing loneliness and isolation at a time where people are more likely to put headphones on than say hi to your barista. Great small talk is a form of connection and it’s also a cultural skill we should be proud to protect and cultivate. Because “For All” groups are bringing communities together. Scores of volunteer and community groups have sprang up across Ireland in response to an increase in asylum seeker arrivals and anti-immigrant protests. In Dublin, many of these “For All” groups have evolved into a network of engagement for the wider community, says Roxanna Nic Liam, a member of the East Wall for All group. “These groups integrate not just asylum seekers, but locals who have been in the community for generations,” she says. “East Wall for All showed us how a working-class area in Dublin really does come together in a crisis and make the area a better place.” Liam Hourican of Dublin 8 For All says the group’s membership has rapidly grown following recent anti-immigrant protests outside two primary schools in Dublin 8. “People were disturbed by the rise of hateful narrative. We think an attack on marginalised members of our community is an attack on all our community.” Dublin 8 For All “makes our community richer”, says Hourican. “This is what our country should be about – we should be open and confident and kind to each other.” Because Dublin keeps showing it solidarity with Palestine. Dublin has long been a focal point for protest and activism in Ireland, and over the past year, it has become a powerful centre for solidarity with Palestine. From the Garden of Remembrance to the gates of Leinster House, tens of thousands have taken to the streets. Palestinian flags hang from shop windows, business awnings and private homes, a sign of collective outrage and empathy. This surge in solidarity is part of a broader, deeply rooted activist spirit in Dublin, where people have repeatedly gathered to reshape Ireland’s national identity, from the Repeal the 8th movement to the Marriage Equality referendum. The same streets that once echoed with calls for reproductive rights and LGBTQ+ equality now resound with chants for justice in Gaza. Because Capel Street is Dublin’s best car-free street. You can keep Grafton Street and Henry Street. Not only is Capel Street longer, it is distinctly better suited to exploit the advantages of a traffic-free environment because it has what the others lack – pubs and restaurants. Retail-dominated Grafton Street and Henry Street are dead once the shops close, but life continues into the evening on Capel Street, pedestrianised in 2022, particularly in summer when people can dine outdoors. During the day, the new public seating is well-used by shoppers taking a rest, teenagers socialising, tourists checking out what their next destination should be, and workers availing of an outdoor space to have lunch. Instead of car fumes and the noise of traffic, now there is the sound of conversation. Instead of pedestrian safety being compromised by vehicles, now there are plants to enjoy. ... followed by Parliament Street. Facing Capel Street across Grattan Bridge, bookended by the Liffey and City Hall, tree-lined Parliament Street was pedestrianised in July. The removal of traffic has the potential to rebalance Temple Bar, drawing more tourists from the busier east end to the West. It is also a big gain for cycling, with a new contraflow lane on Grattan Bridge allowing cyclists to go in both directions from City Hall on Dame Street, along Capel Street and all the way to Bolton Street – a distance of almost 1km. Because the quays are no longer a traffic choked hellscape. Described as a “watery dual carriageway” by Dublin City Council’s head of traffic Brendan O’Brien, the quays served no one – not cyclists, not pedestrians, not bus users, not even the private car drivers who were the largest contributors to its congestion. That has changed. Last summer the council banned private cars and commercial vehicles travelling along the Liffey at either side of O’Connell Bridge from 7am to 7pm. City car parks remained accessible, no Liffey bridge was closed to cars, and once 7pm hit, it was back to the status quo. Yet this one small measure had a transformative effect on traffic. The provision for cyclists is still poor, but the big winners are Dublin’s bus users. Rush hour bus journey times fell by almost a third and timetable accuracy increased. Some motorists still ignore the restrictions, but hopefully the planned introduction of traffic light cameras will sort them out. Because slowly, surely, soul-enhancingly, our city is becoming greener. As the cycleways and pedestrianised areas have expanded, so too have little pockets of green. Whether it’s more trees along the new cycle paths in North Strand or vertical planting out of the bases of old brick walls in the Liberties or St James Linear Park running along the Luas red line in Rialto, these are imaginative, in many cases inexpensive, interventions that go a long way to softening the city’s rougher edges. Cabra is full of brilliant examples such as the Community Roots garden-sharing initiative which matches people who want to grow their own food with others who have space and are happy to share. Then there’s the Cabra Pond, built without a pond liner using bentonite clay, has transformed the area behind the Most Precious Blood Church off Kilkieran Road. The pond is full of tiny frogs at the moment with plenty of swifts soaring overhead – boxes for the birds were organised by Connecting Cabra. Catriona Kenny, a member of that group, says local churches have been generous with their land: “We’ve held biodiversity festivals there, and planted long flowering meadows, native hedgerows and even a mini orchard. A local flood-alleviating project is ongoing around Christ the King Church, to reduce pressure on our storm drains.” Well played, Cabra. Because our traffic junctions have become public works of art. It all started 10 years ago as part of the Dublin Canvas community art project. Artists were asked to come up with ideas for painting over the grey, and much graffitied, traffic light control boxes with all manner of eye-catching art. These brightly painted boxes bring welcome flashes of creativity and colour to otherwise boring bits of street furniture at most junctions throughout the city and suburbs. With another batch commissioned for painting over the coming months, there will be more than 900 spread out across Dublin by autumn. Because our walls talk back. Street artists like Joe Caslin and Emmalene Blake make the city feel alive. Caslin’s soaring portraits – of queer teens, grieving men, hopeful change – don’t just beautify walls, they demand tenderness. Emmalene Blake’s work started with portraiture and has now become more political: hand-painted girls, mothers, and martyrs who quietly reclaim space for care, queerness, and Palestine. In a city often accused of being scrubbed of character, these artists murals remind you what still matters, responding to social crises and political events in real time, turning empty space into activism and concrete into feeling. You look up, and suddenly the city’s talking back. Because people sit anywhere, anytime, anyhow. The provision of public seating in some areas of the city is finally improving, but elsewhere, Dubliners still have to take a load off by sitting on the street, as they have always done. Back in the day, the steps of the Central Bank were where young people gathered, and an ecosystem of subcultures merged; ravers, rockers, goths, grunge heads, skaters, and emo kids. Then it was the steps of the Powerscourt Shopping Centre on South William Street. While the banks of the canals and the boardwalk are well-worn sitting spots, now it’s the kerbs of Drury Street, Castle Market and Fade Street where you’ll find the city’s cool kids hanging out. (The pedestrianisation of South William Street remains in limbo; this could revitalise a street that was once buzzing, but is now pockmarked by vacancy.) Because the Clontarf to city centre cycleway is glorious. Since the early 1990s cyclists heading north from Clontarf have had a traffic free path to enjoy the fabulous vista of Dublin Bay opening up before them, until, that is, they were chucked out unceremoniously at the Wooden Bridge to contend with traffic for a 2km stretch. In 2017 this missing link in the cycle-path was filled in and all was well, unless you were a cyclist heading south from Clontarf, then you were left to dice with death all the way into town. But no more. Last November the Clontarf to city centre cycle route opened. This 2.7km route takes cyclists all the way from the end of the Clontarf promenade to Conolly Station on Amiens Street, but more than that, it offers connections, existing and planned, to a whole network of safe segregated cycle routes. Already cyclists can use it to join the Royal Canal Greenway at Newcomen Bridge and Dublin Port’s new Tolka Estuary Geenway via Fairview Park. In future, the route will be extended from Amiens Street down to the Liffey side paths and one day, if the council implements its Sandymount Strand Road plans, it will be connected to the southside and eventually the long-awaited Sutton to Sandycove (S2S) cycle-path along Dublin Bay could be completed. Because the new S bus routes offer a whole new way to explore the city. Rather than follow the old centripetal pattern of draining humanity into the city centre where people often had to hop off and hop on another bus to get where they wanted to go, the new S buses run across the city. The S2 for example goes from Heuston Station to Sandymount, through the city centre. ... and everyone still thanks the bus driver when getting off. Even if people now have to disembark via the middle doors, they still shout “thanks” up to the driver. And unless you’re wielding a knife the drivers almost always let you travel even if you don’t have change or didn’t know they don’t take e-payments (in this day and age!). Because sea swimming is now a religion with better robes. Irish people have a deep relationship with the sea; we turn to it as a form of escape, of calm, of emotional regulation. Whether you’re partial to Seapoint, Bull Wall, the Forty Foot or Vico Baths, there’s no such thing as off-season: the sea is always there for you. And even if you go alone, there’s a sense of community in being one of the mad ones who embraces the cold at any time of year. The reasons vary – mental health, community, a daily dopamine hit – but the feeling is universal: euphoria, followed by a hot flask of tea and a smug glow that lasts all day. ... and you can swim beside Moglaí Bap from Kneecap at Clontarf Baths. Swimming outdoors in Dublin with the reassurance of a seawater filter was a weirdly impossible dream until relatively recently, but this joyfully jellyfish-free option is now available at Clontarf Baths (€10 for two hours, clontarfoutdoorpool.com). Originally built in the 1880s, the baths reopened after a 22-year hiatus in 2018, initially only for swimming club members, before public sessions were added in 2022. The pool tends to be a few degrees warmer than actual sea temperature, though it might not feel that way if you brave it outside the summer months. With its expansive dimensions, it is an invigorating, open secret swim spot. Moglaí Bap from Kneecap presumably agrees – he was spotted enjoying the baths when the band were in town for their gig at Fairview Park in balmy June. Because saunas have become the new pubs. Forget meeting people for a meal or a drink, the new way to socialise is by sweating together in a sauna, with new ones opening in recently in almost every Dublin postcode, from Killiney to Swords, Dundrum to Ballsbridge. One of our favourites is the Hot Box Sauna in Inchicore, an area recently named as one of the coolest neighbourhoods in the world by Time Out. Because there’s a run club for everyone. Dubliners are embracing new ways of socialising and boosting their health while they are at it, and with a great selection of parks and walkways, it seems only natural. From singles, to gaeilgeoirs to members of the LGBTQ community to asylum seekers, there’s a run club to suit all interests, whether you’re looking to train for a marathon or simply jog 5k; some of the most popular include Sanctuary Runners, Dublin Front Runners, Sole Mates, Run Club Social and Club Reatha. Because Gay Spar is still the best place to feel seen at 2am. Officially known as the Spar on Dame Street, unofficially known as Gay Spar, this 24-hour convenience store is also a safe haven. So-called due to its proximity to The George, “Gay Spar” started as a nickname – but the shop has wholeheartedly embraced it, with windows now emblazoned with rainbow Pride colours. When you stumble in after the club, before the taxi, when your eyeliner’s smudged and your voice is hoarse, you can be safe in the knowledge that you’re not the only glitter-covered person buying a Lucozade and a sausage roll. At a time where corporate LGBTQ+ allyship – no matter how performative – is being rolled back worldwide, Gay Spar has proven to be a steadfast ally. Because some shops are more than just shops. Around the city, independent stores add to the diversity of retail, breaking up the monotony of international chains. Many of these brick-and-mortar stores also act as cultural hubs. Saint Street hosts sessions by local rappers. Emma Fraser’s vintage clothing stores Loot and Nine Crows have expanded into an internationally lauded modelling agency Not Another Agency. Tola Vintage hosts Culture Night parties, and High Rollers has a skate team. At Indigo & Cloth’s micro-cafe, actors, artists, playwrights and crew from the nearby Project Arts Centre grab a brew. Emporium collaborates with the club Index and the record label Soft Boy, home to Kean Kavanagh and Kojaque. Owner of Little Deer Comics Matthew Melis is founder of the Dublin Comic Arts Festival. What all these stores have in common is an independent spirit, a can-do attitude, and a belief that community is what makes a city business tick. Because Stable and The Irish Design Shop are beacons of Irish design. If there’s one shop in Dublin city centre that lifts the spirits in an otherwise mediocre line up of global fashion brands found in any European capital, it is Stable in the Westbury Mall. Founded by friends Sonia Reynolds and Frances Duff originally as a pop-up ten years ago, it celebrates its ongoing success in promoting Irish craftsmanship and native fabrics, designing and making scarves, clothing and home accessories using Irish linen, tweed and handwoven wool. For crafts and jewellery, The Irish Design Shop on nearby Drury Street can’t be beaten. Because indie bookshops are still holding the line. In Books Upstairs, you can climb the stairs to a cafe filled with poetry books and political theory. In The Gutter Bookshop, the staff recommend novels with such genuine joy it feels like a gift. In Hodges Figgis, a 300-hundred-year-old institution, you can still overhear a teenager discovering Sylvia Plath. The best ones – like The Library Project in Temple Bar, with its photo books and zines – remind you that books aren’t just stories, they’re worlds, and Dublin still has places where you can stumble into them. Events like Rick O’Shea’s Writehawks, which allows writers to come in and chat about their favourite books, create a sense of community. Because the George’s Street Arcade is as odd as ever. Where else could you get a nipple pierced and your fortune told before picking up a kaftan, some handcrafted statement jewellery, a batter burger and an oat-milk latte, all under the one roof? Only in Ireland’s first purpose-built shopping centre. While it’s unlikely the youth of the 1880s – when the George’s Street Arcade first opened its doors – were lining up to get body parts pierced or inked, they were no doubt as drawn to the eclectic mix of stalls and shops as more recent generations have been. And sure as anything they used it as a handy and dry shortcut when walking from George’s Street to Drury Street on a rainy day. The closure of Simon’s Place is still mourned by many, but the arcade continues to be a draw for tourists and locals. Because Kish Fish reminds us what food shopping should be like. Kish opened on a back street in the heart of Smithfield in 1979 when Ireland loved the pope and the notion of north inner-city gentrification was as comically unlikely as a computer company paying us €13 billion in back tax or some class of silicon docks popping up at the back of Irishtown. The fishmongers standing behind the beds of tightly packed ice are old-school and fiercely obliging, happy to fillet and skin whatever takes your fancy and teach you how best to cook it. You won’t find that service in many supermarkets. Because of the second-hand treasure troves. Dublin’s street style is a combo of Pellador jumpers and Claddagh ring emblems, mixed with second-hand finds uncovered in the city’s charity and vintage shops – from the legendary Lucy’s Lounge in Temple Bar and Monto on Parnell Street, to the newer Big Smoke Vintage in Temple Bar. As for the “chazzas”, Dublin has a wonderful selection of shops that follow each other like stepping stones, from Capel Street to George’s Street, Camden Street and into the southside. Because the flea market scene keeps offering new treasures. In 2018, the Dublin Flea Market ceased trading due to redevelopment around Newmarket Square, much to regret of locals and fans of a good bargain. But residents were delighted to welcome the revived Newmarket Flea in July. Elsewhere in the city, Quirk, Le Zeitgeist, Libertine Market Crawl, Flux Market and the Block Market in Charlemont Square have all helped turn thrifting into a social event. Flea markets are a haven of creativity and community, showcasing the best of local artists, crafts and vintage fashion collectors. It’s not just about finding something rare and engaging in a spirit of sustainability as old items become loved again, it’s about chatting to the sellers, grabbing a coffee, and seeing what strange treasure finds you. Because Change Clothes offers us a guilt-free wardrobe refresh while saving clothes from landfill. In 2022, Mary Fleming set up Change Clothes in Crumlin, initially a one-week pop-up devoted to clothes swapping, workshops and exhibitions. Fast forward to 2025 and Mary’s word is spreading far and wide across Dublin. Now based on Thomas Street in Dublin 8, Change Clothes hosts clothes swaps, fill-a-bag events, sewing machine classes and textile upcycling events. Donated clothing is redistributed to people in need, and traineeships are offered to those looking to get started in the textile industry. Change Clothes also enables other social enterprises to host clothes swaps events by providing clothes rails and the know-how. Because the city finally knows how to eat. There was a time when “going out for food” in Dublin meant soggy panini or bafflingly expensive Caesar salads. Not any more. From Filipino adobo tacos to cardamom cruffins to smoked fish toasties made in tiny food trucks, the capital’s kitchens are having a golden age. There’s imagination, care, spice. Pop-ups and wine bars. Places you tell your friends about immediately, unless you want to keep them to yourself. It’s not just fancy spots – it’s the fact that Dubliners now expect their food to taste of something. And it does. New favourites include Little Lemon on Duke Lane, Pickosito on Mary Street, Fidelity in Smithfield, Lupillos in Inchicore, and Cat You Café in Ringsend for the best acai bowl in town, as well as the global streetfood stalls at the recently opened Priory Market in Tallaght. Because Assassination Custard is defying the odds. In a city where independent restaurants are being flattened by rent hikes and global roll-outs, and Dublin dining has blurred into velvet booths, TikTok interiors and menus written by accountants, Ken Doherty and Gwen McGrath’s Assassination Custard in Dublin 8 remains a quiet act of resistance. Opened in 2015, it shut in July 2023 to reassess how – or if – it could go on. It reopened in February, reshaped but not softened: bookings open weekly on Instagram, lunch Wednesday to Friday, with two sittings, 12pm and 1.30pm. Bookings are for one or two people, dining at shared tables, maximum eight people. It’s €35 a head minimum (less if solo). Now serving wine: one red, one white, and a vermouth at €8.50 a glass. The paper-bag menu shifts with the season and their format: always vegetarian options, often offal – tripe, kidneys, hearts – and pickles, ferments, anchovies, and pig’s ear. No PR machine. Two cooks, three tables, and a welcome that proves why small matters. Because Green Man Wines is one of the best wine shops in the world. Rajat Parr – the world’s most revered blind-taster – walked into Green Man Wines in Terenure and, like every wine nerd, did a double take. More than 1,000 lines, from smaller producers who farm organically, biodynamically, “naturally”. Wines with energy, not funk. Most fall into the €20-€40 range, though there are four-figure unicorns. Opened a decade ago by Dave Gallagher and his wife, the late Claire O’Boyle Gallagher, it still reflects their mix of obsession and warmth. All bottles can be opened on-site for €15 corkage. Dan Smith, formerly of Airfield Estate, is the chef in the wine bar (Thursday-Saturday), serving a rotating menu, built around small plates that pair with the wine. “Wine Tasting Wednesdays” bring visiting winemakers pouring their bottles, with Dan riffing on the regional food. Because the world’s best chefs treat Fish Shop like a local. The Smithfield room is tiny – two marble-topped counters, 15 stools, a chalkboard menu, and a killer wine list: Jura whites, grower Champagne, alpine Nebbiolo, island wines from the Med. Peter Hogan and Jumoke Akintola opened Fish Shop here in May 2016, following their Blackrock Market stall. The menu still includes their renowned fish and chips but has quietly grown. The rule remains: wild, Irish-caught fish and seafood only. No tuna, bream, sea bass, imported prawns. Grilled John Dory or brill are mainstays, alternatives include gurnard or red mullet. Shellfish from the Copper Coast – crab, shrimp, lobster, whelks – are delivered from Tramore by Peter, and Irish langoustines or tiny seasonal shrimp, depending on the catch. Famous chefs eat here, of course. International names, tipped off about our restaurant critic Corinna Hardgrave’s favourite casual restaurant in Dublin. Good luck getting a seat. Because the Mushroom Butcher is Dublin’s most original pop-up. Mark Senn, a Melbourne-born chef who once ran the short-lived Veginity and Vish, now grows and cooks mushrooms near Leonard’s Corner in Dublin 8. Mushroom Butcher is his Saturday-only food truck – parked outside a converted retail unit where he and his partner, Ingrid Baceviciute, cultivate a dozen or so delicate, short-shelf-life mushroom varieties rarely seen in Ireland. Staples have included king oyster schnitzel, mushroom XO sauce with polenta chips, and a vegan bánh mì, and more recently, he’s featured a series of themed menus – Brazilian, Japanese, Greek and Italian – all cooked to order. The mushrooms themselves are sold fresh and appear on menus at some of the country’s best restaurants. No delivery. Just a hyper-focused weekly service that’s growing something new – literally, from the ground up. Because Al Khair restaurant at the mosque on South Circular Road is an escape to another culture. At Al Khair, the canteen-style restaurant tucked behind the blue gates of the mosque on South Circular Road, hospitality means food – shared, abundant, unforgettable. Opened in 1985 by Mohammed Yousuf, now run by his son Junaid, the food is what he calls Indian with a “gentle Pakistani influence”, which in practice means you get the creamy warmth of paneer and dal, the deep spice of slow-cooked lamb, and the slap-you-awake heat of aubergine bharta when you ask for it spicy. The vegetarian samosas are wonderful. Because the new generation of cocktail bars rival the best in the world. When Dave Mulligan felt the city needed some old school night-time glamour, he reimagined the old Sackville Lounge off O’Connell Street. This old boozer still has that classic Dublin pub feel, but it’s also new and sleek with a cocktail menu that will knock your socks off. But what else would you expect from head bartender Dave Taylor, who also oversees operations at nearby award-winning Bar 1661? This year, Bar 1661 represented the Irish cocktail scene at the prestigious Tales of the Cocktail in New Orleans, showcasing all that is great about Irish spirits and Irish drinks. Because of the secret table in Pepper Pot Café. Most Dubliners know about the pear and bacon sandwich in the Pepper Pot Cafe. (If you don’t, and think pear and bacon come across as unlikely breadfellows, just try it.) Most of us also know the Pepper Pot is one of Dublin’s best cafes for people watching, on the balcony in the Powerscourt Townhouse Centre overlooking the bustling hordes below. But our favourite place to perch is at the table we like to call the secret table. In a room away from the main seating areas, it’s where the cafe’s baking magic happens. Here you can eat your pear and bacon or equally lovely sausage sandwich while watching croissants being laminated and bagel dough being pulled. Now, like Doris Day’s secret love, our secret table’s no secret any more. But that’s okay. We don’t mind sharing. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Five things investors should ponder on crypto
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/08/02/five-things-investors-should-ponder-on-crypto/
Time Published: 2025-08-02T04:00:00Z
Full Content:
A decade ago half a dozen mavericks assembled in a Swiss house to launch ethereum – a piece of the crypto ecosystem that acts as a distributed computing platform, using the ether token. It initially looked likely to fail: the founding tribe imploded after bitter internal fights; ethereum suffered a large cyber hack; scandals erupted and, like bitcoin, ether’s price became crazily volatile, surging from nothing to $5,000, before collapsing. But this week something striking occurred: just as the White House was issuing a report about the Golden Age of Crypto, the Nasdaq exchange celebrated ethereum’s 10th birthday. “Ethereum has demonstrated itself ... as the definition of antifragile,” enthused Joe Lubin, one former inhabitant of that founding house, who presents the platform as “a reliable trust layer for our fast-growing digital world”. Cynics will undoubtedly wince in horror, while enthusiasts will cheer. No wonder: crypto is arguably the single most divisive issue in finance today. [ Crypto investors need more detailed warnings about risks involved - Central BankOpens in new window ] However, I would suggest that this anniversary should spark a more realistic – and subtle – judgment. For the past decade has revealed at least five key points about crypto that investors should ponder. First, and most obviously, digital assets are not homogenous (even if detractors hate them all). Bitcoin is a one-dimensional phenomenon that fans liken to “digital gold”, while ethereum is a multifaceted infrastructure. Memecoins (like $TRUMP) only float on crazy hype, but stablecoins are supposed to be backed by assets, like treasuries. This matters. Second, we need to move beyond black-and-white thinking with crypto. The evangelists who declared a decade ago that distributed finance would transform the world were wrong – thus far digital assets are still too clunky, costly and energy-guzzling to displace most mainstream payment options, and too volatile to be a reliable store of value. Criminality has been rife. Just think of the saga of Sam Bankman-Fried, or regulatory censure of the tether stablecoin. But doomsayers who predicted crypto’s demise were equally wrong. Digital asset prices have just soared (again), pushing ethereum and bitcoin’s market capitalisation up to $455 billion (€398.6 billion) and $2.3 trillion respectively. And the $270 billion-odd worth of stablecoins in circulation are supported by as many transactions as the Visa credit card network in the last year, as Glenn Hutchins, a long-time tech investor, tells me. Why? Greed (or speculation) is one factor. But crypto is founded on an interesting innovation (blockchain) that can sometimes be useful (say, for some cross-border payments). Moreover, some key players and regulators are raising standards in response to past scandals and networks like ethereum are slashing energy usage. [ A lesson from The Godfather as Wall Street backs crypto assets it once dismissed as a ‘fraud’Opens in new window ] Third, mainstream finance is moving in. This is ironic, given that early crypto evangelists promised that distributed finance would depose incumbents. But it is driving the current boom. Consider the fact that a top BlackRock executive has just joined an ethereum investment group; or that traditional asset managers like Fidelity, BlackRock and Vanguard are launching crypto funds; or how mainstream investors are increasingly using crypto as a diversification play, while banks such as JPMorgan are running their own blockchains and launching stablecoins. Fourth, the geopolitics of crypto are shifting – fast. In the past decade, most innovation occurred outside the United States, in places such as Hong Kong. But this week Paul Atkins, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said he wanted to pull it onshore. Why? One reason is that the Trump family itself is invested in crypto. Another is grubby politics: crypto groups were such big Trump donors in 2024 that luminaries tell me they won the election for him. But geofinance matters too. Treasury secretary Scott Bessent hopes that dollar-based stablecoins will create a new source of demand for treasuries, and promote more dollar usage around the world. Consider this a new policy twist on Bretton Woods in the Silicon Valley age. Finally, crypto’s second-order effects could turn out to be even more striking than the digital assets themselves. For what the innovation does is enable us to imagine alternatives to the financial and geopolitical status quo – for instance, by asking if we need to rely on the Swift payment system, or dollar dominance. Don’t get me wrong: by making these five points, I am not downplaying the risks. The Trump administration’s conflicts of interest with crypto are shameful. The potential for consumer harm is real. There are financial stability risks due to crypto’s growing links with mainstream finance, and the use of treasuries to back stablecoins. Criminality and grift exists. But it is possible to worry about these risks – and want better regulation – but at the same time to recognise that the underlying technology can be useful as a geopolitical and financial diversification tool. For these reasons, ethereum’s “birthday” should prompt enthusiasts and doomsayers alike to realise that neither of them is entirely right. Life is rarely black and white – in finance or anywhere else. That will not change even if (or when) ethereum turns 20. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2025 Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Ethereum Taker Sell Volume Hits $335M In Just 2 Minutes: Panic Or Profit-Taking?

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Ethereum has faced an 8% correction since Monday, cooling off from its recent rally and slipping below the key $3,850 level. This move suggests that the bullish momentum that carried ETH higher in July is beginning to fade, with price now entering a critical consolidation phase. Bulls are still holding key support levels, but the threat of a deeper correction is growing as selling pressure intensifies. On-chain data shows signs of profit-taking from large investors, adding to short-term volatility and uncertainty. Heavy selling volume over the past two days has sparked speculation across the market, especially as Ethereum remains below recent local highs. Analysts are split in their outlook—some argue that this is a healthy pullback within a broader uptrend, while others warn of a potential slide toward the $3,400–$3,500 range if sentiment worsens. Despite the recent drop, Ethereum’s long-term structure remains intact, with fundamentals like growing DeFi usage and Layer 2 adoption continuing to support the narrative. However, the next few days will be critical. If bulls can defend current levels and regain momentum, ETH could attempt another move toward $4,000. If not, the market may see extended downside pressure before a clearer recovery emerges. According to top analyst Maartunn, Ethereum experienced a dramatic spike in taker sell volume, reaching $335 million in just two minutes. This massive wave of sell orders signals a key moment in the market, one that could mark either the peak of profit-taking or the end of panic-driven capitulation. While some interpret the event as large investors securing gains after the recent rally, others believe this could reflect emotional selling from retail traders spooked by short-term volatility. Despite the heavy selling pressure, Ethereum’s long-term bullish narrative remains intact. Large players continue to accumulate, taking advantage of dips and buying from weaker hands. This activity suggests strategic positioning ahead of expected growth in adoption, especially as Ethereum cements its dominance in decentralized finance (DeFi) and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. ETH spent months in a downtrend earlier this year, weighed down by macro uncertainty and regulatory fears. Yet, while the broader market showed weakness, sophisticated investors appeared to accumulate. Now, with sentiment shifting and the price structure strengthening, Ethereum seems well-positioned for the months ahead. The $335 million sell-off highlights market vulnerability—but also shows that whales are stepping in. If price holds current levels and sentiment stabilizes, Ethereum could see a renewed push toward the $4,000 mark as confidence returns. Ethereum (ETH) has officially broken below its critical resistance zone near $3,860, signaling increased selling pressure and short-term weakness. After maintaining a steady range for nearly two weeks, the price has dropped to $3,619 on the 4-hour chart, finding temporary support just above the 100-period SMA (green line), currently near $3,670. This breakdown comes amid an uptick in bearish volume, suggesting momentum may favor sellers in the short term. The 50-period SMA (blue line), located around $3,762, has now turned into near-term resistance, capping any immediate recovery attempts. If bulls fail to reclaim the $3,760–$3,800 zone, Ethereum could risk deeper downside toward the next key support around $3,175 (200 SMA, red line) or even $2,852, which served as a base in early July. Despite this weakness, the broader trend remains structurally bullish as long as price stays above the 200 SMA. However, bulls must reclaim the $3,860 level and build momentum above it to regain strength. Until then, volatility is expected, especially as profit-taking and macro uncertainty weigh on sentiment.

Δ These RWAs include stocks, bonds, bank deposits and real estate, CoinDesk reported Friday (Aug. 1), citing Bank of America analysts. Investors see opportunities in fractional ownership that broadens access to previously illiquid asset classes, as well as risks of disruption to financial institutions’ transaction services businesses, according to the report. At the same time, there’s a growing belief that financial institutions will adapt to the growing use of blockchain technology, per the report. The tokenization of RWAs is driving an on-chain revolution across capital markets, PYMNTS reported in April. RWAs are tangible or intangible assets that have been tokenized and placed on a blockchain. Tokenization refers to the process of issuing a digital token that represents ownership or a claim on an underlying asset. Tokenization of these assets enables organizations and enterprises to take advantage of automated processes on various blockchains, and the tokenization of traditionally illiquid assets makes them easier to buy, sell and trade on secondary markets. The President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets’ report “Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology,” which was released Wednesday (July 30) by the White House, sets expectations for digital asset governance while signaling federal alignment on the need to facilitate innovation — particularly in payments infrastructure and tokenized financial instruments. When asset manager BlackRock unveiled its first tokenized fund issued on a public blockchain, the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), Carlos Domingo, CEO of Securitize, BlackRock’s Web3 partner in the fund, said: “Tokenization of securities could fundamentally transform capital markets. Today’s news demonstrates that traditional financial products are being made more accessible through digitization.” Reports over the last month or so said that JPMorgan is developing a new service to tokenize carbon credits, Kraken unveiled a platform allowing retail investors to buy tokenized versions of major U.S. equities, and Robinhood announced it was rolling out tokenized stocks to a select cohort of international users. Each of these initiatives moves traditional financial services onto the blockchain, representing a coordinated push by financial giants to tokenize RWAs.

Title: Ripple CTO Answers 6 Pertinent Questions About XRP In Quest To Take Over SWIFT
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-cto-answers-to-xrp-questions/
Time Published: 2025-08-01T20:00:19Z
Full Content:
Ripple Chief Technology Officer (CTO) David Schwartz has addressed critical questions regarding XRP’s role as the crypto firm looks to replace SWIFT. Schwartz indicated that the altcoin was irreplaceable in the firm’s operations despite the issuance of the RLUSD stablecoin. In an X post, Ripple CTO first touched on the question of how the crypto firm has over 300 bank partnerships, but XRP on-chain volume remains low. Schwartz opined that there are several reasons why their clients have preferred to use the altcoin off-chain rather than on-chain. However, he believes that they are close to changing that because institutions are now seeing the benefits of moving on-chain. The Ripple CTO admitted that XRP’s on-chain volume has been very slow. He noted that even the crypto firm can’t use the XRPL DEX for payments yet because they can’t be sure a terrorist won’t provide the liquidity for payment. Schwartz added that features like permissioned domains will address this issue. Secondly, the Ripple CTO addressed why XRP is still being used over stablecoins for transfers despite its volatility. He explained that there are use cases where volatility isn’t a minus and is instead a plus. He remarked that generally, the view for most digital assets is that the upside outweighs the downside. As such, as long as one isn’t very risk-averse, Schwartz believes that holding the altcoin is not a disadvantage. The next question was about the incentive to hold XRP if volatility isn’t an issue, because it is a bridge currency. The Ripple CTO said that a bridge currency only works if someone is holding it, so they can get it precisely when they need it. He suggested that it may be best to hold XRP, which is the current dominant bridge currency, because it should be cheaper to exchange it into whatever they happen to next. Furthermore, David Schwartz answered whether XRP as a bridge currency will still be necessary when stablecoins cover most pairs in the future. The Ripple CTO answered that if one stablecoin wins, then the altcoin won’t be necessary, as that stablecoin will just serve as the bridge currency. However, the Ripple CTO opined that one stablecoin can’t win for several reasons. This includes the fact that a stablecoin can only be stable relative to one particular fiat currency and will always have jurisdictional ties. As such, Schwartz believes that it still makes sense to have a bridge asset like XRP in this multi-stablecoin world. As to why giants like BlackRock would want to use XRP Ledger for tokenization instead of building their own blockchain, the Ripple CTO doesn’t think that will matter as long as there is interoperability and asset portability. He added that multi-chains are a good form of scalability as well. Meanwhile, on geopolitical risk and why foreign countries would trust a U.S.-based private company payment network, the Ripple CTO clarified that the XRPL is not really U.S.-based. Schwartz further remarked that the network has never discriminated against any particular participant. He also noted that Ripple has separately licensed entities in many jurisdictions for its enterprise payment products, which makes it not restricted to just the U.S. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Time Published: 2025-08-01T18:04:34Z
Full Content:
A US judge on Friday largely rejected a request by top asset managers including BlackRock to dismiss a lawsuit filed by Texas and 12 other Republican-led states that said the companies violated antitrust law through climate activism that reduced coal production and boosted energy prices. US District Judge Jeremy Kernodle in Tyler, Texas, agreed to dismiss just three of the 21 counts in the states’ lawsuit, that also names institutional investors State Street and Vanguard. The lawsuit is among the highest-profile cases targeting efforts to promote environmental, social and governance goals. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said the three companies “created an investment cartel to illegally control national energy markets and squeeze more money out of hardworking Americans,” and that “today’s victory represents a major step in holding them accountable.” The three asset managers said they would continue to defend against the claims, with Vanguard calling the ruling disappointing, and State Street calling the case a risk to investors and energy markets. “By pursuing forced divestment, the Attorneys General are undermining the Trump Administration’s goal of American energy independence,” BlackRock said. The ruling by Kernodle, who was appointed by President Trump, means the states can move forward with their claims that the asset managers violated US antitrust law by joining Climate Action 100+, an investor initiative to take action to combat climate change, and used their shareholder advocacy in furtherance of its goals. Kernodle, however, dismissed claims that the asset managers violated Louisiana and Nebraska consumer protection laws. The companies have denied wrongdoing and called the case “half-baked.” But the states’ theories garnered support from Trump-appointed antitrust enforcers at the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission. The outcome of the lawsuit could have major implications for how the companies, which together manage some $27 trillion, approach their holdings and passive funds. One possible remedy sought by the plaintiffs would be for the fund firms to divest holdings in coal companies, which BlackRock has said would harm the companies’ access to capital and likely raise energy prices.

Title: Crypto ETFs See Record $12.8B Inflows in July as Market Rallies to New Highs

Crypto exchange-traded funds on U.S. exchanges recorded their strongest month ever in July, attracting $12.8 billion in net inflows as investor enthusiasm surged alongside rising token prices and optimism around regulation. The data, reported by Bloomberg Intelligence’s Eric Balchunas, marks a new monthly record for the sector. The only month that came close was November 2024, when markets rallied on the election of Donald Trump, who was widely viewed as favorable to crypto interests. This time, bullishness may be driven less by politics and more by fundamentals. The crypto market, as tracked by the CoinDesk 20 Index, jumped over 21% in July. Bitcoin BTC$114,037.62 rose 7%, topping a new all-time high of $122,408 during the month. Much of the action centered around BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which has quietly grown into a financial giant. With over $86 billion in assets, IBIT now outpaces established ETFs like the S&P 500-tracking IVV and the Russell 2000’s IWM. The fund’s higher fee structure makes it more lucrative for BlackRock than even its flagship equity products. These gains may be just the beginning. Earlier this week, the Securities and Exchange Commission approved in-kind creation and redemption for all spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, a technical change that’s expected to improve efficiency and appeal for institutional investors. For large asset managers, in-kind redemptions let them swap crypto assets without triggering taxable events or facing liquidity crunches—making the funds easier and cheaper to manage at scale.

Title: Hong Kong firm appeals for legal protection of investors as its Panama Ports contract faces lawsuits

A subsidiary of a Hong Kong conglomerate entangled in U.S.-China tensions has appealed for legal protection for businesses in Panama after the company’s contract over its Panama Canal port assets has been faced with lawsuits HONG KONG -- A subsidiary of a Hong Kong conglomerate entangled in U.S.-China tensions appealed on Friday for legal protection for businesses in Panama after the company's contract over its Panama Canal port assets has been faced with lawsuits in the Central American country. Respect for the rule of law is essential to assure businesses that Panama is a safe place to invest in, Panama Ports Company, under Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings, said in a statement. Panama’s Comptroller General filed two lawsuits on Wednesday, seeking to declare unconstitutional a contract that granted the operation of ports at both ends of the canal to the Hong Kong subsidiary, and to nullify its renewal four years ago, saying it was “abusive” of Panama's interests. In turn, Panama Ports Company said its operations have had a positive impact, from building world-class ports to creating more than 25,000 direct and indirect jobs and contributing billions of balboas — Panama's currency — to the country's economy. It said it wants to work with the government in Panama for a better future. “Regarding the ongoing legal actions, we firmly believe that respect for legal protection and the rule of law are essential in order to provide businesses and investors with the certainty that Panama is a safe country to invest in,” it said. The company operates the ports of Balboa, in the Pacific, and Cristobal, in the Atlantic, under a concession contract approved in 1997 and renewed in 2021 for 25 more years. CK Hutchison is controlled by the family of Li Ka-shing, the southern Chinese city’s richest man. Panama’s comptroller authority in April said that an audit of Panama Ports Company found irregularities in the renewal of the concession. But the company denied allegations that it had failed to pay about $1.2 billion to the Central American country. Panama President José Raúl Mulino said during his weekly news conference on Thursday that he fully supported the comptroller’s case and would await the court’s verdict. “We have all seen what that contract has costed the Panamanian nation over time,” Mulino said without elaborating. He alluded to some sort of public-private partnership for the ports, saying there was a lot of interest from private companies, but that it was in the early stages and provided no details. CK Hutchison Holdings’ initial plan, announced in March, to sell its port assets in dozens of countries to a group that includes the U.S. investment firm BlackRock Inc., also got caught up in tensions between Beijing and Washington. U.S. President Donald Trump, who has alleged that China interferes with the canal, initially welcomed that plan. However, it apparently angered Beijing and drew a review by Chinese anti-monopoly authorities. After months of uncertainty, Hutchison said on Monday that it may seek a Chinese investor to join a consortium of buyers, which also includes BlackRock subsidiary Global Infrastructure Partners and Terminal Investment Limited, a subsidiary of the Mediterranean Shipping Company. The initial deal, valued at nearly $23 billion, including $5 billion in debt, would have given the consortium control over 43 ports in 23 countries, including the two at the Panama Canal. Panama Ports Company said Friday it would communicate with the Panamanian government “at the appropriate time,” affirming that it believes engaging with the government “is vital to discuss the way forward for” the company. Panama's government maintains it has full control over the canal and that the operation of the ports by Hutchison does not mean Chinese control of it. ___ Associated Press journalist Alma Solís in Panama City contributed to this report. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: US Treasuries Soar As Slower Job Growth Boosts Fed Rate-Cut Bets

Treasuries rallied, with short-term yields posting their biggest drop in a year, after softer US jobs data prompted traders to boost bets that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates as soon as next month. Yields on two-year notes tumbled 21 basis points to 3.74%, setting up the biggest drop since last August. Traders fully priced in two rate cuts this year, with an 80% chance of a reduction in September. The move weighed on the dollar and stocks, sending an index of the greenback’s strength down as much as 1% and the S&P 500 nearly 2% lower. The yield moves reflected a dramatic shift in sentiment around the monetary policy outlook, shaped in part by President Donald Trump’s relentless pressure on Fed Chair Jerome Powell to cut rates despite elevated inflation expectations. “We would look for the Fed to begin lowering rates in September,” said Gregory Faranello, head of US rates trading and strategy for AmeriVet Securities. “It’s somewhat amazing how you can have a sitting Fed Chair intimate the strength in labor one day and receive these numbers a few days later.” Expectations for rate cuts collapsed on Wednesday after Powell’s latest comments on the outlook, less than an hour after Trump said it was his understanding the Fed would cut in September. Friday’s rebound — a seeming validation of Trump’s view and those of two Fed governors he appointed, who dissented from the July 30 decision not to cut rates — may prove historic. The moves were sparked by a report on US labor that showed payrolls increased 73,000 in July. Figures for the prior two months were revised down by nearly 260,000. The jobless rate ticked up to 4.2%, from 4.1%. While the pace of hiring has been slowing since April, Powell said low unemployment indicated the jobs market was “in balance” when explaining why policymakers remain on the sidelines. On Friday, Fed Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman expressed concerns that policymakers’ hesitance to lower rates could risk damaging the labor market. The two policymakers voted against the Fed’s decision this week, opting for a quarter-point reduction. The jobs report suggests Waller’s camp “may hold sway or convince more people to come on his side of the argument. And maybe they missed the opportunity in July but it raises the odds you get it in September,” said Jeffrey Rosenberg, portfolio manager at BlackRock Inc., said on Bloomberg Television. “That is why you are seeing the big move on the front end of the curve.” Friday’s rally reversed Treasuries’ 0.4% loss last month, only the second monthly decline this year. The market is still up 3.4% for the year. “It’s a big beautiful bond market,” said Michael Collins, portfolio manager at PGIM Fixed Income, said on Bloomberg Television. He prefers the two- to 10-year part of the curve where “you don’t have to take a lot of interest-rate risk to get a lot of benefit.” The magnitude of the shift Friday was reflected in high trading volumes in Treasury futures. Some of that activity involved scrapping wagers on shrinking gaps between short- and long-term Treasury yields, which became losers in the rally unleashed by the jobs data, in which those gaps widened as two- to five-year yields saw the biggest declines.

Title: As Tariffs Bite and Jobs Stall, New Interactive Tool Tracks How Much Trump and GOP Are Raising the Cost of Living

Yves here. The lead stories in the press are about Trump’s August 1 tariff salvo, but it’s a little too soon for much in the way of analysis, as opposed to reaction. These tariffs are sure to increase inflation in the US even if some companies accept reductions in their lofty profit levels (corporate profits have been at a sky-high percentage of GDP for years). So we’ll turn to a new tool for estimating increases in living costs after a couple of hot takes on what Trump has wrought. Just after the Trump tariff announcements, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released its jobs report, and it was a doozy. Not only was the headline number, a mere 73,000 new jobs markedly lower than expectations, and an increase in unemployment to 4.2%, which is not all that bad. But when you look under the hood, it’s much worse. From Bloomberg: Rosenberg of BlackRock says the revisions show a “dramatically different picture” now when you look at the past three months. Before these numbers, the three-month average for payroll gains was 150,000. With the revisions for May and June and the new July figure, the three-month average is now 35,000. That’s entirely different. Oh, and the reason for the big initial overstatement and then the revisions? The so-called birth-death models, which estimates employment growth resulting from new business creation. Those who were following the econoblogosphere in the runup to the financial crisis will recall Barry Ritholtz, Michael Shelock, and then-luminaries who are no longer posting regularly assailing the birth-death model results to be greatly exaggerated, among other reasons due to big falls in construction, and on a scale to distort the overall results. And even before the jobs data hit the wires, some economists were stressing that the tariff increases would hurt demand. From a different Bloomberg account: But at an average of 15%, the world is still facing some of the steepest US tariffs since the 1930s, roughly six times higher than they were a year ago. Trump’s latest volley outlined minimum 10% baseline levies, with rates of 15% or more for countries with trade surpluses with the US. So far, the global economy has held up better than many economists expected after Trump’s initial tariff blitz. A rush to beat the elevated rates spurred a front-loading of exports, aiding many Asian economies and shielding US consumers from price spikes. That could all be about to change. “For the rest of the world, this is a serious demand shock,” Raghuram Rajan, former India central bank governor and chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, who is now a professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, told Bloomberg TV on Friday. “You will see a lot of central banks contemplating cutting as the rest of the world slows somewhat in the face of these tariffs.” In other words, in the US, the tariffs will increase stagflationary pressures. That view is confirmed by a report at CNBC: The latest U.S. tariff policy is “still not the end of the story,” Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said Friday. “President Trump’s latest flurry of tariffs implies that the US effective tariff rate will rise to about 18%, from 2.3% last year,” he noted. That’s higher than expected and carries downside risks for global economic growth projections, as well as some upside risk for U.S. inflation forecasts, Brown said.

Dáte (@svdate) July 31, 2025 Note that Trump’s tariff use of emergency powers to impose tariffs is facing a series of court challenges. Most experts expect Trump to lose. If that happens, it would not only wonderfully discredit Trump but also require a costly refunding of the tariffs collected. With Jerome Powell having sat pat on interest rates, after Trump screamed for a cut, Trump will further increase pressure for the Fed chair’s ouster, which will only increase investor upset. But the odds are not trivial that Powell’s concern, of tariff-induced price increases, will be borne out in the next month or two. And as we have repeatedly pointed out, while a central bank’s interest rate increases can choke economic activity, it does not follow that putting money on sale provides a boost. Most businesses decide to expand operations based on conditions in their market, as in demand and competitor activities. The only enterprises where cheap money in and of itself might lead to incumbents to increase their activities are ones where the cost of money is one of their biggest expenses. Those are mainly financial institutions and financial speculators like real estate developers and hedgies. Common Dreams has publicized a new way to get a better approximation of the real cost of Trump tariffs and other policy measures on household budgets, I hope some of you will road test it, and if is seems useful, encourage people you know, particularly in the press, in politics, or active in social media, to add it to their toolbox. By Julia Conley, staff writer at Common Dreams. Originally published at Common Dreams Six months into U.S. President Donald Trump’s second term, an economic justice group on Thursday unveiled an interactive tool to help Americans put a number on the unmistakable feeling many have reported having about the Republican leader who promised to “make America affordable again”: that costs have in fact gone up under Trump, and that the White House and the GOP are to blame. Using the tool introduced by Unrig Our Economy, people across the U.S. can see exactly how much the price of essentials has gone up in their state, with the advocacy group connecting the dots between the rising cost of living and Trump’s tariffs as well as corporate tax breaks Republicans have relentlessly pushed to pass. According to the “Don’t Inflate Our Plates” tool, the price of beef in Texas has gone up nearly 47% since the early days of Trump’s second term, while eggs cost $3.19 more than they did before Trump took office. In California, eggs now cost over $5.00 more than they did before Trump’s second term, based on “historical trends, real-time supplier data, and market analysis” that Unrig Our Economy examined. Trump & congressional Republicans claim that food prices will come down. While they raise prices – we pay. 🚨So we built a brand-new site to hold them accountable:https://t.co/h3lVqz2Z6A tracks food prices in real time — and exposes how the GOP's policies are raising costs. pic.twitter.com/YKvzMV683Z — Unrig Our Economy (@UnrigOurEconomy) July 31, 2025 Unrig Our Economy gained some of its data from Kroger’s pricing data, finding that in states with Kroger stores, the price of beef has gone up between 16% and 72%, with the biggest price hikes in Alaska and Utah. Egg prices in particular were a talking point for Trump during his presidential campaign, but they’ve risen in many states where Kroger operates, with customers in Michigan—where the president won in 2024—paying 58% more for eggs. “Trump and Republicans in Congress are singlehandedly inflating the cost of everyday items that Americans rely on,” said Leor Tal, campaign director for Unrig Our Economy. “While billionaires and corporations cash in on Republican-backed tax breaks, working-class families are left paying higher prices for eggs, coffee, and more.” Unrig Our Economy pointed to reporting on Trump’s tariffs, more of which are set to be announced Friday, with the president expected to impose rates up to 50% on some imports. As Common Dreams reported this week, the advocacy group Groundwork Collaborative found that just as corporate executives used labor shortages and supply chain disruptions during the coronavirus pandemic as cover to keep prices high even after those problems were resolved, many are now using tariffs as a justification for price increases. “We certainly welcome a reduction in the Chinese tariffs, but we’ll be announcing a price increase here regardless of any changes of the Chinese tariffs over the next week or two to go into effect in June,” the CEO of one footwear brand said in a recent earnings call. Unrig Our Economy pointed to recent polling that showed Americans overwhelmingly disapprove of Trump’s tariffs, including 47% of Republican voters. The Trump administration has also made a number of regulatory moves benefiting corporations that aim to take as much money from working families’ household budgets as possible, including a push for the cancellation of a Biden-era Federal Trade Commission rule allowing consumers to easily cancel subscriptions; the FTC’s decision to drop a lawsuit challenging price discrimination by PepsiCo; and the commission’s move shutting down public comments on corporate pricing tactics. The interactive tool was unveiled weeks after the president signed into law his sweeping domestic policy and budget package, which includes the largest cuts to public programs like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program in history, increases monthly payments for student loan borrowers under repayment assistance plans, and hands out $117 billion in tax cuts to the richest 1% of Americans while providing just $77 billion in cumulative savings to the bottom 60% of earners. As Unrig Our Economy unveiled its tool allowing Americans to see exactly how their household budgets are being impacted under the Trump administration, the Century Foundation (TCF) and Morning Consult released the results of a poll in which they asked more than 2,000 people in June how they were being affected by the high cost of living over the past six months. More than half of respondents said “billionaires, corporations, and congressional Republicans have made their lives harder,” and 60% said the Trump administration is to blame for the higher cost of living. More than 4 in 5 Americans said they were concerned about the price of groceries, and nearly half were concerned about their ability to pay their rent or mortgage. Forty-eight percent said they would have difficulty paying an unexpected $500 bill, like a home repair or medical bill, without borrowing or using credit, and nearly 20% said it would be “very difficult” to make the payment. Even among households with incomes over $100,000, more than a third said they would have a hard time meeting the surprise expense without dipping into savings or using credit cards—suggesting that these households are using a large proportion of their relatively comfortable monthly income for essentials “While the federal government tears down programs such as Medicaid and food assistance and federal regulators give the green light to companies to rip off consumers, families are being forced to construct their own safety nets from a web of risky financial practices,” said TCF. Unrig the Economy said that with Don’t Inflate Our Plates, the group is calling out “the Republican-backed policies that got us here” and demanding “that Congress put working people first.” Saw an article in the last couple of days warning that Social Security Staffing cuts might threaten Cost-of-Living Adjustments- no one there to analyze infaltion. Someone commented that there was plenty of data available everywhere. This looks interesting. Bill Maher, the Nobel Prize winning economist, declared he was wrong about the inflationary effects of Trump’s tariffs. The effort and study into Maher’s advanced degrees must have displaced the simple Econ 101 exhortations about lagging effects of policies on the real economy. A small additional point for Mr. Maher: the economy is NOT the Stock Market and the three major Indices reported breathlessly every night on Broadcast news. I’m sorry but Common Dreams is mostly apology for the D faction – it’s all the bad ol’ Rs. They are proponents of the Bipartisan status quo. The D faction has done nothing but vote for kleptocracy, anti-labor, pro-finance, genocide, war and everyone turns a blind eye to the rampant institutional corruption in both the so-called public and private sectors. “… More than half of respondents said “billionaires, corporations, and congressional Republicans have made their lives harder,” and 60% said the Trump administration is to blame for the higher cost of living…” So whaddya gonna do? Vote D? Arrghh The same old garbage for decades got us where we are now. The US is an oligarchy, let’s stop pretending otherwise, the charades have become tiresome and irritating. The judicial branch make a mockery of the law and the constitution, the legislative branch are openly and legally bribed, and the Idiot Emperor and the Kakistocrat Krew are accelerating the rot. Also, when are folks going to see that the Emperor has lost his marbles? Dude is showing signs of physical and mental decline. Even the so-called liberal outlets don’t see it. I guess late-stage empire produces deep corruption, kleptocracy, corruption, kakistocracy and war. Don’t need to say “so-called liberal” as liberal is an enforcer of the status quo as well as being Far-right wing. This is ad hominem and a violation of our site Policies. You don’t disprove the validity of the remark. And inequality and immiseration of the poor is increasing enormously under Trump. No, it was an attack on the credibility of Common Dreams. As in, if the witness is unreliable, that is grounds to doubt the testimony. Ad hominem is an attack on the messenger unrelated to the message. Credibility, however, is always relevant. Jeez Louise, you fail as a pedant. No, ad hominem is not about testimony. It is the logical fallacy of trying to dispute the validity of an argument by attacking the party that said it. You might try using the modern invention of a search engine rather than tout your erroneous beliefs. Ad hominem (Latin for ‘to the person’), short for argumentum ad hominem, refers to several types of arguments where the speaker attacks the character, motive, or some other attribute of the person making an argument rather than the substance of the argument itself. This avoids genuine debate by creating a diversion often using a totally irrelevant, but often highly charged attribute of the opponent’s character or background. The most common form of this fallacy is “A” makes a claim of “fact”, to which “B” asserts that “A” has a personal trait, quality or physical attribute that is repugnant thereby going off-topic, and hence “B” concludes that “A” has their “fact” wrong – without ever addressing the point of the debate. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem Your comment about credibility is also false. Even parties with erratic track records can make accurate observations. That is why you must address the argument on its merits. That’s right. The Democratic Party knows that all it has to do to regain power is wait for Trump to self-destruct. They have no intention of creating plans that would improve the lives of ordinary people. JonnyJames is also wrong in his depiction of Common Dreams. They are Sandernistas. They have often criticized Team D from the soft left. I did apologize in advance, and apologize for sounding offensive.I take your point, and I do admit that I am angry about the political situation in general. We can quibble about Common Dreams, they do post some good material, however I am overly sensitive about Rs this, Ds that at this point. It all seems so superficial and lost in the forest for the trees. My observations are not necessarily ad hom polemics, given the context. I did engage in ad hom in “the Idiot Emperor and the Kakistocrat Krew”. But I have heard many analysts we all follow say very similar things. I have read CD for years, and I feel that they have done the old bait and switch routine every election. It is not ad hom to say that. The old, “hold your nose and vote D” the lesser evil and all that. From what I have read here over the years, we all agree on the main point: partisan politics is a dead-end. The US has no functioning democracy and can be seen as an oligarchy. 1. Common Dreams very often posts about the US as an oligarchy but (like pretty much everyone) they have no or unrealistic ideas. So I don’t agree with your characterization 2. Common Dreams did not endorse Harris, which for a reader-supported venue generally aligned with the Sandernista left was pretty bold. They still said Trump was awful and dissed voting third party, but throwing cold water on Kamala would at the margin lead more readers to vote for Stein or another third party candidate. See: https://www.commondreams.org/opinion/we-can-t-endorse-harris-but-we-oppose-trump-and-voting-third-party-is-a-mistake I know am being unrealistic in my expectations, but the implicit assumption is if you don’t vote 3rd party, then one must “vote” for the D (or R) candidate. (in our FPTP electoral system) So although they did not explicitly endorse Harris, they did not endorse an alternative candidate, thus the endorsement was by default. The way electoral issues are framed are a bit disappointing to me, but that’s just me. Also, on foreign affairs, I have been disappointed with stuff like this https://www.commondreams.org/opinion/putin-russia-gas-ukraine-war https://www.commondreams.org/opinion/trump-vance-putin https://www.commondreams.org/views/2022/02/20/vladimir-putin-authentic-leader-republican-party No, they were endorsing not voting at all. Or not voting for a Presidential candidate but voting down ticket. That is where their logic goes. They might not have been able to admit that to themselves. Thank you for hearing me out, I should have articulated the fine points in my earlier post. I mean…the writeup by Yves and some of the linked articles, including Common Dreams pointed to multiple examples of things that the Biden administration did to help consumers but which were – or are in the process of being – intentionally overturned by the Trump administration. For example the CPFB and the “click to cancel” thing. While we on the left may have a lot of legitimate long term beef with the trajectory of the Democratic Party, as far as average American “consumers”, the GOP and in particular Trump are demonstrably worse. ‘Republicans against Trump @RpsAgainstTrump Brazil is the largest exporter of coffee to the U.S. With Trump’s 50% tariffs on Brazilian imports, your coffee is about to get a lot more expensive. (Prices have already jumped over 15% in recent months.) All because he wants to protect his corrupt friend Bolsonaro. Insane.’ The whole thing is asinine but I wonder if Washington will privately agree to look the other way if, for example, Brazilian coffee was shipped to say Mexico who then sold it to the US for a marked up price. If there was a mini-revolt over the price of coffee, the Trump regime might think it wise to go this way to take some off the pressure form these price increases. And this could happen for other goods as well. Trouble is his admin is shot through with ideologues who might rebel at the idea. “If there was a mini-revolt over the price of coffee…” As one NC commenter recently stated, “Coffee is not a matter of life or death, it’s much more important than that.” Also see Michael Pollan on caffeine and capitalism: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHW7Ly8k0X8&t=7s Might one then infer that a lack of caffeine will bring about socialism, inefficiencies due to acquiescent lassitude, something else entirely? Does the price of eggs have anything to do with tariffs, or just with bird flu and the culling of birds? I’ve no doubt the tariffs will have significant impact, but the eggs are one of the only concrete [ie non-political] statistics in the linked article. TOM: A google search found the USA is importing eggs from Turkey and South Korea. Other sources being considered include Europe and Brazil. It is difficult to imagine large eggs being more than $5 doz anywhere in the USA, but well, California is “special”. Before Covid they were 49¢ per doz here. But for a few weeks now (in Wisconsin) they have been holding at $2.71 at Aldi (and I think that is high). Here on Cape Cod, they are $6.99 and up a dozen. Massachusetts has cage free laws. organic pasture raised go for around 10 bucks a dozen here in California. My ladies make them for chicken feed (and whatever bugs they scrounge). Where are policy proposals that stand a chance of enactment to reverse the rise in interest costs? What will those mean to you, me and our friends, neighbors and everybody? After absorbing increase in premiums on auto insurance and housing insurance, I’m waiting patiently on the retrospective analysis of what Did Happen the last four years between mid year 2021 to January 2025. This isn’t what about the other side necessarily but clowns like a Krugman or Noah Smith were crowing loud and proud on the wonders by those Biden administration economic policies. Mainstream economists deserve their scorn and this cheerleading is readily available to find from previous years. My last six month auto premium finally flattened out, or unchanged. Year to date the average price on a gallon of gas is practically unchanged as well. Feel welcome to highlight items that have increased or will be increasing in that basket of theoretical groceries for a family of four. But personally my personal cost of living increased by roughly 25% to 35% during that aforementioned time frame until early 2025. The cost of natural gas from PG&E went up about 40 percent in the last year. Locally grown organic eggs are still around $10 per dozen. That’s down from $12 from a few months ago. Our auto insurance premium actually went down a whopping $1.66 per month. Alas, our business work van with tools of the trade was recently stolen, so if Farmer’s runs true to form they’ll get back their buck sixty-six and a whole lot more come renewal time. Trade van thefts are rampant here no doubt due to harder economic times, and our town seems able to afford only 1 police officer per 10,000 residents, which is 1/3 the national average. Good times! Forgot to add, our city’s parsimony when it comes to citizen security services is rather baffling in that we are hardly a community of poors, over the last few years under state pressure we’ve added thousands of new residential units, and our state and local taxes are some of the highest in the nation. PG&E, aren’t they a notorious and poorly run energy utilities company on the west coast I wish to suggest? I don’t do organic anything to be honest, so the best of my egg purchases in a convenient dozen currently run about $3 per dozen for a store branded carton. My personal experience is just that, of course within my daily or monthly consumption patterns. A simple anecdote from a supposedly “Simple Man!” We went from high times under Biden and just now people ( not specifically to you or anyone here ) recognize the cost of living increased dramatically since 2021….oh come on. Would a Harris administration really have made marked improvements or changes in a few short months? I think, in that hypothetical , most media would’ve extended a grace period but that is just me being a cynical American citizen. I had 3 Bidenomics sightings yesterday, people walking on the road in this rural area where if you’re doing that, you’re in a bad way. What looked like a couple and two individuals. I got lucky with auto insurance this go around, the price went down slight; and I negotiated a better deal with Spectrum, to my shock, sans TV bundle. Just Internet-only now, and for about $16 less per month. I was shocked. Things were deteriorating even prior to our surprise jobs number today. I’m an owner of a thirty year old wholesale specialty food and spice business. We import and then manufacture, package items you cannot get onshore, or often times, spices etc that literally cannot be grown here. Yet these inputs are being tariffed seemingly with zero thought, foresight, planning. It’s the whim of the king and whether someone was mean to his bestie decision making. But small businesses like mine have very little runway to get through this environment. Everyone I know is getting more convinced (perhaps a bit of wish casting) that the courts will strike down the tariffs. They have already lost in US Trade Court by unanimous decision. The US Appeals Court yesterday seemed very skeptical of the governments position. I expect the decision to be the same as the Trade Court. SCOTUS? Not so sure. And how long must we wait? Or if the decision ultimately doesn’t go his way, will he even abide by it? In the meantime the admin is blowing up businesses, jobs, inflation. I see it up close everyday. “Yet these inputs are being tariffed seemingly with zero thought, foresight, planning.” You’re dead wrong: it’s a great big beautiful plan and you and I ain’t in it. Hey, us not being in, IS the plan. Saw a published US unemployment stat for the last quarter that youth unemployment had risen from 9.2% to 10%, which qualifies the headline rate. Trump didn’t like todays jobs report so he fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics Erika McEntarfer. https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/trump-orders-firing-bls-commissioner-weak-jobs-report-rcna222531 I struggle to visualize what is the outcome Trump and his cronies expect from this. Tariffs are only a good threat so long as the US market is good; now, 342 million people is nothing to scoff at, but as immiseration sets apace and companies are forced to diversify buyers (after all, the only reliable expectations scenario for Trump is that he does things on a dime and can cause ruinous losses based on whims) how relevant will the US market keep on being? Furthermore, in a pure balance-of-payments matter, the US dollar as the global means of payment, store of value, etc. necessitates US deficits, as is well known. The attempt (meagre as it may be) to induce surpluses would imply catastrophic deflation, as too few dollars are available for world investment/commerce needs, and the obvious impossibility to industrialize (I don’t expect Trump and his ilk to follow the Credit Theory of Money, though). On the other hand, the deflationary pressures could well make everyone who is holding treasuries and the like to cash out in order to benefit from the currency arbitrage, causing raising yields, an incapability to refinance the US debts, and stock and commodity prices to soar (since the dollars would have to be put somewhere that isn’t more US treasuries). Any way out of this dilemma that I can see is to cause either inflationary ruin or bankruptcy (and maybe both). Is there anyone thinking of the consequences? A large cause of all that US currency floating around in the world is due to the country’s five-decades of consecutive trade deficits where it has paid for imports with US cash/debt. When the US had a trade surplus, other countries would want to borrow US money in order to buy American production. If the US was competitive in international trade, other countries would buy US goods with the dollars they are holding reducing the amount of US money floating around out there. Increased manufacturing in the US would also mean faster economic growth, more jobs and more tax revenue – this would reduce the rather huge 6-8% of GDP federal budget deficits that the country is experiencing. Well, it looks a bit vaporwareish at this point. I can go to the linked website and compare the price of beef at Kroger’s for different states, which I guess is something. Also, I’m sorry if this is also ad hominem, (at least not a direct criticism) but hello! 1997 would like their web designer back . . . I suspect that people are underestimating the economic cliff dead ahead due to the front-loading of US imports (to avoid tariffs). The front-loading both delayed and will soon enhance the effects of the tariffs on PRICES and REAL ACTIVITY and TRADE. Now that 18% average US tariffs are permanent, US imports will not only decrease in an amount consistent with an increase in the average tariff from 2.3% to 18%, US imports will also decrease an even larger amount to make up for the excess inventories that were previously imported to front run the increased tariffs. This sudden tremendous decrease in US imports will sharply decrease global real activity in the second half of 2025. Similarly US businesses will go from having abundant low-cost front-loaded inventories to suddenly having scarce high-cost inventories. Prices will increase dramatically and rapidly in the US in the second half, even as global GDP plummets. Data point: 3-4 months ago I paid $13.99 for a 2.5 pound bag of Costco’s French roast whole coffee beans. The following month it was $116.99, and ten days ago I paid $19.99. Regardless of the beans’ origin that is a coffee Brazilian. I’m assuming you mean $16.99 not $169.99. I just read this article right before your comment, coincidentally: https://www.barchart.com/story/news/33822282/coffee-prices-plunge-as-supply-concerns-ease I don’t see how the price action downwards makes sense on the tariff exemption news? It was caused by a lack of supply due to environmental factors. A reduction in tariffs would only increase US consumption of it. Ive been talking to a lot of coffee roasters recently and one mentioned that Robusta will likely come back into favour as Arabica becomes harder to grow due to climate change. He mentioned that Arabica became the popular bean partly because it was seen as a “premium” bean in the first place. Anecdotally, my friend recently brought back some Robusta from Vietnam and it had amazing flavour. I feel like it’s underrated, at least here in Canada. Oops! You are correct. It was $16.99. In Trump’s defense, he is working to improve the economic numbers: Trump fires Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner after disappointing job numbershttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-fires-commissioner-of-labor-statistics-july-jobs-report-erika-mcentarfer/ Eggs were about $12 last fall at my local Costco last fall. Last I checked in the Spring of this year they were $8.99. I’ll take a look again but I don’t think they are up $5 since Trump took office. Your email address will not be published.

BlackRock's ETHA commands Ethereum ETF inflow surge, capturing 78% of total investments. Spot Ethereum ETFs had their 20th straight day of net inflows as of July 31, the longest streak of positive flows since their debut. According to data from SoSoValue, these funds attracted a combined $17 million in net inflows on the day. This sustained momentum has pushed total inflows across the nine spot ETH ETFs to nearly $5.4 billion, significantly higher than the cumulative flows seen in previous months. In fact, this month’s inflows are approximately three times greater than the second-highest month since launch. BlackRock’s spot ETH ETF, ETHA, led the charge with $4.2 billion in monthly inflows, accounting for 78% of all capital flowing into Ethereum ETFs. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas highlighted the pace of growth, calling it “wild.” He noted that if Bitcoin ETFs didn’t exist, ETHA would be the fastest ETF in history to reach $10 billion in assets, beating previous records by nearly 2x. These consistent gains have significantly boosted the total net assets under management. The spot Ethereum ETFs now hold $21.52 billion in net assets, representing 5% of Ethereum’s total market capitalization. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential. He imparts insights on a range of topics like DeFi, hacks, mining and culture, underlining transformative power.

Title: Why ethereum is suddenly beating bitcoin
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/ethereum-vs-bitcoin-eth-btc-price-crypto-rally-spot-etfs-2025-7
Time Published: 2025-08-01T09:30:02Z
Full Content:
The world's most popular cryptocurrency is being outdone by its closest competitor in the last few weeks. Bitcoin has rallied to record highs this year, but its more recent performance has lagged behind ethereum. Ethereum's price is up 54% over the last month, compared to bitcoin's 10% increase. Zack Shapiro, an attorney at the Bitcoin Policy Institute, told BI there were a handful of reasons ethereum has pulled ahead. "I think a lot of it is that it's a speculation trade," he said of ethereum's latest rally. "Long term, we have to see." Here are some of the things Shapiro thinks are driving the fervor for ethereum. Markets are enthusiastic about stablecoins after the passing of the GENIUS Act, the Senate's landmark bill that sets the terms surrounding stablecoin regulation and opens the door for more issuers to mint their own fiat-backed tokens. Tether, USD Coin, Binance USD, and other top stablecoins on the crypto market are issued on the Ethereum network. "People think that stablecoins might proliferate a lot more. Maybe some of those stablecoins will be on ethereum," Shapiro said of the market's psychology. Retail giants like Walmart and Amazon are reportedly considering their own stablecoins, and using the tokens for retail payments would be a "big breakthrough" for the market, according to Apollo chief economist Torsten Sløk. Shapiro says institutional investors have also recently offered ethereum ETFs, another factor driving inflows into the token. BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale are among the firms that now offer a spot ethereum ETF. BlackRock's iShares Ethereum Trust ETF is up 48.9% over the last month. Fidelity's Ethereum Fund is up 33.1%, while Grayscale's Ethereum Mini Trust ETF is up 49.2% over that time frame. Cumulative spot ethereum ETF volumes rose to $123.5 billion as of Wednesday, according to data compiled by The Block. Corporate crypto treasuries have also proliferated in 2025, and recently, many have been scooping up ethereum. Bitmine Immersion, one such crypto treasury, said last week it raised its ethereum holdings to over $2 billion. The Ether Machine, another crypto treasury firm, said on Wednesday that its total ethereum holdings had climbed to $56.9 million. "Those vehicles are out there buying ethereum. And so that could also be additional buy-pressure that's moving up the price," Shapiro said. Shapiro isn't certain that the momentum will last for ethereum. He believes much of the hype for the coin in recent weeks has to do with excitement and uncertainty over ethereum's potential catalysts. The crypto's rally could lose steam once more regulatory details are solidified, he said. He pointed in particular to the CLARITY Act, the crypto market structure bill that's awaiting approval in Congress. "Is the market structure bill going to pass? Are these sort of crypto primitives going to find product market fit in the market? And then is Ethereum, as opposed to other blockchain systems, going to be the winner from that?" Shapiro said. "I would personally probably sell the news." Check out Business Insider's picks for best cryptocurrency exchanges Check out Business Insider's picks for best cryptocurrency exchanges Jump to

Title: Oculis Upsized Loan Facility to Access up to CHF 100 million

Time Published: 2025-08-01T08:00:00Z
Full Content:
August 01, 2025 04:00 ET | Source: Oculis Holding AG Oculis Holding AG ZUG, Switzerland, Aug. 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Oculis Holding AG (Nasdaq: OCS; XICE: OCS) (“Oculis” or the “Company”), a global biopharmaceutical company focused on innovations addressing ophthalmic and neuro-ophthalmic diseases with significant unmet medical needs, today announced that it has amended its loan facility (the “Amended Loan Agreement”) with funds and accounts managed by BlackRock (the “Lender”). The Amended Loan Agreement replaces the prior loan agreement between Oculis and the Lender dated May 29, 2024, and the upsized structure will provide CHF 75.0 million in borrowing capacity (which may be increased to up to CHF 100.0 million) (the “Loan”). The Loan comprises tranches 1, 2 and 3, in the amounts of CHF 25.0 million each, as well as an additional loan of up to CHF 25.0 million, which may be made available by the Lender to Oculis on mutually agreed terms. No amounts were drawn at signing. Access to this additional capital offers significant financial flexibility beyond Oculis’ current cash reserves as the Company moves toward upcoming key milestones across all three core assets: regulatory discussions with the FDA on three indications investigated with Privosegtor (OCS-05) for acute optic neuritis, non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuritis (NAION), and treatment of acute relapses in multiple sclerosis (MS) during 2H 2025; initiation of Licaminlimab (OCS-02) Phase 2/3 trial for dry eye disease in 2H 2025; initiation of Privosegtor (OCS-05) Phase 2/3 trial for acute optic neuritis in 1H 2026; OCS-01 Phase 3 DIAMOND trials’ topline results in Q2 2026, and if positive, its first NDA filing in 2H 2026. Riad Sherif, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Oculis, said, “We are pleased to have upsized our previous loan agreement with funds and accounts managed by BlackRock, which expands an instrument allowing enhanced flexibility to ensure the future financial and operational strength of Oculis. Our current robust cash position provides runway into early 2028, which is further strengthened by the loan facility, as we remain focused on advancing our portfolio of differentiated assets and bringing transformative treatments to those who need them most.” About Oculis Oculis is a global biopharmaceutical company (Nasdaq: OCS; XICE: OCS) focused on innovations addressing ophthalmic and neuro-ophthalmic conditions with significant unmet medical needs.

August 01, 2025 04:00 ET | Source: Oculis Holding AG Oculis Holding AG ZUG, Switzerland, Aug. 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Oculis Holding AG (Nasdaq: OCS; XICE: OCS) (“Oculis” or the “Company”), a global biopharmaceutical company focused on innovations addressing ophthalmic and neuro-ophthalmic diseases with significant unmet medical needs, today announced that it has amended its loan facility (the “Amended Loan Agreement”) with funds and accounts managed by BlackRock (the “Lender”). The Amended Loan Agreement replaces the prior loan agreement between Oculis and the Lender dated May 29, 2024, and the upsized structure will provide CHF 75.0 million in borrowing capacity (which may be increased to up to CHF 100.0 million) (the “Loan”). The Loan comprises tranches 1, 2 and 3, in the amounts of CHF 25.0 million each, as well as an additional loan of up to CHF 25.0 million, which may be made available by the Lender to Oculis on mutually agreed terms. No amounts were drawn at signing. Access to this additional capital offers significant financial flexibility beyond Oculis’ current cash reserves as the Company moves toward upcoming key milestones across all three core assets: regulatory discussions with the FDA on three indications investigated with Privosegtor (OCS-05) for acute optic neuritis, non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuritis (NAION), and treatment of acute relapses in multiple sclerosis (MS) during 2H 2025; initiation of Licaminlimab (OCS-02) Phase 2/3 trial for dry eye disease in 2H 2025; initiation of Privosegtor (OCS-05) Phase 2/3 trial for acute optic neuritis in 1H 2026; OCS-01 Phase 3 DIAMOND trials’ topline results in Q2 2026, and if positive, its first NDA filing in 2H 2026. Riad Sherif, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Oculis, said, “We are pleased to have upsized our previous loan agreement with funds and accounts managed by BlackRock, which expands an instrument allowing enhanced flexibility to ensure the future financial and operational strength of Oculis. Our current robust cash position provides runway into early 2028, which is further strengthened by the loan facility, as we remain focused on advancing our portfolio of differentiated assets and bringing transformative treatments to those who need them most.” About Oculis Oculis is a global biopharmaceutical company (Nasdaq: OCS; XICE: OCS) focused on innovations addressing ophthalmic and neuro-ophthalmic conditions with significant unmet medical needs.

Title: Institutional Money Is Moving Into The Ethereum Ecosystem; Here Are The Top ETH Token Price Predictions

Recently, there has been an unprecedented influx of capital into the Ethereum ecosystem, with data showing billions in record-breaking monthly inflows. The Ethereum ETF spot approval and rising DeFi dominance have continued leading the way as institutional money keeps flowing in. However, with the inflow comes a surge in attention to Ethereum top tokens such as AAVE, Remittix, and Ethena. But with these tokens seeing renewed pump, here is a look into Ethena price direction and what AAVE price prediction looks like this month. The Ethereum ETF has continued extending its rising Ethereum ETF inflow with a record 17-day extension. Ethereum’s global reach with the ETF has also continued pushing the token closer to a new bull breakout as traders eye $4,000. However, fundamental factors have proven instrumental in the rising Ethereum price as new announcements keep adding to the large inflow. One of the latest updates analysts are eyeing lately is the news of Deutsche Bank’s tokenization platform on Ethereum. Therefore, with new projects such as the BlackRock BUIDL fund and Sharplink Gaming, experts remain bullish on rising inflows to Ethereum. Top AAVE price prediction speculates a 100% rise before November this year. The bullish season is a factor experts believe could boost the AAVE price as Ethereum leads the altseason. Moreover, as institutional traders continue moving millions into Ethereum, AAVE price prediction continues to stand stronger. However, while a whale withdrawal last week gave the AAVE price prediction a shakeup, new Metamask integration is renewing the hope. This is a new AAVE Price prediction suggests a potential high of over $500 before the end of the year. Ethena price surge joined the ranks of the major breakouts last week, with a bullish stretch recording over 140% in the last 30 days. The Ethereum rising inflow is projected to see the Ethena price hit a new high this year, with a target $1.50. The Ethena price setup shows 3 bullish candles breaking out above the 50 SMA on the weekly chart, fueling bullish sentiment. A growth in Ethereum staking yield is projected to see Ethena price rise to $4 before mid-2026. Remittix is another Ethereum token growing to be the best this year, with utility and adoption. While Remittix is new to the ecosystem, its fast climb in the last few weeks shows it could soon take over the market. This includes a breakout surge in presale already hitting $17.9 million, making it the best crypto presale of 2025. The Remittix solution is not feeding off hype, but rather on a solidly built utility that analysts believe could be the future of crypto payment. Below are some of the features making Remittix stand out at the moment: With Remittix set to launch in the coming weeks, experts forecast up to 30x in breakout after hitting the exchange.

Title: Ireland’s Cliodhna Moloney-MacDonald: ‘We want to leave a legacy from the World Cup’
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2025/08/01/cliodhna-moloney-macdonald-we-want-to-leave-a-legacy-from-the-world-cup-in-terms-of-our-performance-and-how-we-are-supported-by-the-irish-people/
Time Published: 2025-08-01T05:00:01Z
Full Content:
Two days out from the first of the two warm-up games before the Women’s Rugby World Cup in England, Clíodhna Moloney-MacDonald is reflective. With 43 Ireland caps to date, she is one of the players lining out against Scotland on Saturday in Cork who was involved in the home World Cup back in 2017. “I think a lot has changed,” says Moloney-MacDonald. “The tournament structure has changed hugely. The numbers that go have changed hugely. Women’s rugby has advanced a lot. So while I might have experience – and people will be asking me questions anyway – that’s not World Cup relevant. “I’ve been around a long time, I do know a lot of players from other countries and how they play. I’ve experienced playing against a lot of other countries, even at a club level, like playing over in England [with Exeter Chiefs], I would experience playing against a lot of these teams and players from these teams.” The landscape of women’s sport and women’s rugby has exploded since 2017, and Irish women’s rugby has been on an emotional rollercoaster, with more lows than highs in that time. Through all this, the support of family, friends, and fans has remained consistent. “[The 2017 World Cup] was a huge occasion, and getting to play in front of all your family and friends, it was amazing. That’s probably something that will remain the same. We’re as close as we could be to a home World Cup so the support element will hopefully be huge.” Saturday’s game at Musgrave Park and the following Saturday’s encounter with Canada at Ravenhill have been organised to give fans a chance to see off the team in style before they set up base in England. “People can fly over from Shannon, Dublin and wherever, and there’s lots of games all over the country,” says Moloney-MacDonald. “We want to give our team a great send-off and prepare ourselves as best as possible. But we also want to get people behind us a little bit. So performance is the main goal, but we do want to feel a little bit of support and love from the Irish people before we head off.” Managing those small things will be critical for this weekend’s first warm-up game against Scotland, who beat Ireland in the final Six Nations game earlier this year. “We were disappointed at the end of the Six Nations to lose that game, it’s not one that we should have lost, we feel,” admits Moloney-MacDonald. “We’ll want to put those things right, just for our performance, like the things we got wrong that day. We want to tidy up on them. But it is more about performing as a team in the way that we want to play and the way that we want to approach this World Cup.” Every game and every opponent is different, but the guiding goal is the same: getting to Twickenham for the World Cup final. “We know what we need to do at each stage but we’re not overestimating; this week is about Scotland, next week about Canada. Then it’s selection and getting there and then it’s each game at a time, and the pool games are each going to be very challenging in their own way.” Having the World Cup so close, and hopefully performing well, could help achieve another of the team’s goals: to fuel the growth of the game in Ireland. “We do have our goals individually and for each game, and obviously we need to get there first. But obviously the overall plan and strategy and everything is about growing the game in Ireland and that’s always in the back of our mind. “When we travel over to England, the lucky ones that get to go, we want to bring the sport with us, but we also want to leave a legacy from this World Cup in terms of our performance and how we are supported by the Irish people.” IRELAND (v Scotland, World Cup warm-up, Saturday, Musgrave Park, 2pm): Méabh Deely (Blackrock College/Connacht); Béibhinn Parsons (Blackrock College/Connacht), Nancy McGillivray (Exeter Chiefs)*, Eve Higgins (Railway Union/Leinster), Amee-Leigh Costigan (Railway Union/Munster); Dannah O’Brien (Old Belvedere/Leinster), Molly Scuffil-McCabe (Manawatū/Leinster); Siobhán McCarthy (Railway Union/Munster), Clíodhna Moloney-MacDonald (Exeter Chiefs), Sadhbh McGrath (Cooke/Ulster); Eimear Corri-Fallon (Blackrock College/Leinster), Sam Monaghan (Gloucester Hartpury/IQ Rugby) (capt); Grace Moore (Trailfinders Women/IQ Rugby), Ivana Kiripati (Creggs/Connacht)*, Brittany Hogan (Old Belvedere RFC/Ulster).

Share this article Seven major asset managers – Grayscale, VanEck, Bitwise, Canary, Franklin Templeton, Fidelity, and CoinShares – on Thursday submitted amended S-1 registration statements to the SEC for their proposed Solana (SOL) ETFs. The amendments represent the firms’ continued efforts to secure regulatory nod to expand their crypto ETF offerings beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum products currently available to US investors. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas and ETF Store President Nate Geraci note that the revised filings demonstrate active engagement between the SEC and ETF issuers. Not really… but clearly dialogue w/ SEC and issuers are refining prospectus language. Gotta think fees in neighborhood of btc & eth ETFs. — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) July 31, 2025 Industry experts project a 95% probability of SEC approval for spot Solana ETFs, though prospects are unclear for products incorporating staking features. Meanwhile, asset managers like BlackRock are seeking regulatory approval to incorporate staking into their existing spot Ethereum ETFs. Geraci suggests staked Ether ETFs could receive the next regulatory approval, following the SEC’s recent authorization of in-kind redemptions for spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs. Several organizations, including Jito Labs, VanEck, Bitwise, the Solana Policy Institute, and Multicoin Capital, are advocating for the SEC to permit liquid staking in Solana-based ETPs. Liquid staking enables tokens to maintain liquidity while being staked, providing benefits such as enhanced capital efficiency, lower ETP operational costs, and expanded security and investor options.

Title: SEC Chair Discusses American Leadership in Digital Finance — Project Crypto
URL: https://clsbluesky.law.columbia.edu/2025/08/01/sec-chair-discusses-american-leadership-in-digital-finance-project-crypto/
Time Published: 2025-08-01T04:01:15Z
Full Content:
It gives me great pleasure to be with you all, particularly at what I believe is a defining moment for American leadership in the crypto asset markets. Before I share a few reflections, I want to thank the America First Policy Institute for convening such a timely conversation. And, I must note, in order to keep my compliance folks happy, that the views I express here today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the SEC as an institution or of the other Commissioners. *** Today, I would like to discuss what Commissioner Hester Peirce and I are calling “Project Crypto,” which will be the SEC’s north star in aiding President Trump in his historic efforts to make America the “crypto capital of the world.”[1] But before I discuss our plan for crypto market primacy, let me take a few moments to revisit some inflection points in the history of our financial markets that bear similarities to the one we are at now, so that the future we shape is worthy of the legacy that we inherit. The winds of innovation have always swept through our capital markets, often at gale force. In 1792, they rustled the leaves of a buttonwood tree, beneath which two dozen stockbrokers assembled to establish the forerunner to the New York Stock Exchange. That modest agreement—fewer than a hundred words handwritten on a slip of parchment—set in motion an elegant design that would govern the flow of capital for generations.[2] In the centuries since, our markets have never stood still. They have expanded, evolved, and reinvented themselves in step with the ideas and technologies of their time. Markets are dynamic because of the people who participate in them. Markets channel human ingenuity toward society’s most intractable problems by rewarding those who develop the most innovative solutions that others value enough to buy. They are the mechanism by which Adam Smith’s invisible hand elevates those who act in the common good—even when pursuing their own. The SEC’s role is to safeguard markets that allow the spark of human creativity and skill to benefit society. Over the arc of its history, the agency has both enabled innovation and, regrettably at times, stifled it. Fortunately, progress has a way of prevailing. And when our regulatory posture is calibrated to meet innovation with thoughtfulness rather than fear, America’s leadership position has only grown stronger. *** In the 1960s—before my time, I am happy to say—Wall Street was riding a bull market. But behind the scenes, our market machinery was straining to keep up. Most clearing and settlement transactions involved a costly and cumbersome process. Rising stacks of paper stock certificates had to be physically delivered by clerks wheeling carts up and down Wall Street and in other financial districts all across America.[3] It was a scene from another century struggling to meet the demands of the modern securities markets. Indeed, the paper-based clearance and settlement systems, built for a gentler era, began to buckle under the weight of soaring volumes. Delays at one firm held up the work of another. Securities were lost or stolen. Fails ballooned. And many thinly capitalized broker-dealers were caught by the whiplash of scuttled transactions. In desperation, trading hours were reduced and exchanges eventually closed on Wednesdays to allow firms to process the mountains of certificates. The breakdown over an antiquated system was described by the SEC chairman at the time as “the most prolonged and severe crisis in the securities industry in 40 years… Firms failed. Investor confidence plummeted.” And very much to its credit, the SEC was proactive in remedying the so-called “Paperwork Crisis.” The agency helped market participants to develop the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, which would transform how securities were held and traded.[4] Instead of shuffling paper certificates from customer to broker, broker to broker, and broker to customer, title to shares could now be transferred through computerized ledger entries.[5] The certificates themselves were immobilized, stored securely in vaults, as ownership moved electronically, laying the foundation for the modern clearing and settlement system that has continued to this day. The ticker tape machine—like the one here—was also a breakthrough of its time, revolutionizing how Americans accessed market information, line by line, trade by trade.[6] But breakthroughs don’t belong in the past. By the late 1990s, electronic trading systems surged in popularity, unsettling old assumptions about how markets should function. Chairman Arthur Levitt likewise believed it behooved the SEC to provide regulatory flexibility for the electronic markets to innovate.[7] So, Regulation Alternative Trading Systems, or “Reg ATS,” adopted in 1999, allowed for ATSs to be regulated like broker-dealers, rather than like exchanges.[8] So, this brings me to today. To a moment that demands American ambition. To a project that can unleash it. Our regulatory framework need not be anchored to an analog past—unkind to new frontiers. After all, the future is arriving at full speed—and the world is not waiting. America must do more than just keep pace with the digital asset revolution. We must drive it. So today, I would like the world to go on notice that under my leadership, the SEC will not stand idly by and watch innovations develop overseas while our capital markets remain stagnant. To achieve President Trump’s vision of making America the crypto capital of the world, the SEC must holistically consider the potential benefits and risks of moving our markets from an off-chain environment to an on-chain one. We are at the threshold of a new era in the history of our markets. As I mentioned earlier, today I am announcing the launch of “Project Crypto”—a Commission-wide initiative to modernize the securities rules and regulations to enable America’s financial markets to move on-chain. Just a few weeks ago, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law, ensuring that America will continue to lead in global payments with a gold standard stablecoin regulatory framework. Upon signing the GENIUS Act into law, I was pleased that President Trump endorsed Congressional efforts to pass crypto market structure legislation by the end of the year. I commend the House of Representatives for garnering such strong bipartisan support, and I look forward to working with the Senate as they build off the House’s work and craft market structure legislation that future proofs our markets against regulatory mischief, cementing the United States as the crypto capital of the world. Yesterday, the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets released the PWG Report with clear recommendations for the SEC and other federal agencies to build a framework to maintain U.S. dominance in crypto asset markets. This report is the blueprint to make America first in blockchain and crypto technology. The President said last week that he wants “the entire world running on the backbone of American technology.”[9] I stand ready to help get that job done. That is why I am launching Project Crypto and directing the SEC’s policy divisions to work with the Crypto Task Force, led by Commissioner Peirce, to swiftly develop proposals to implement the PWG’s recommendations. Project Crypto will help ensure that the United States remains the best place in the world to start a business, develop cutting-edge technologies, and participate in capital markets. We will reshore the crypto businesses that fled our country, particularly those that were crippled by the previous administration’s regulation-by-enforcement crusade and “Operation Chokepoint 2.0”[10] Whether an incumbent or a new entrant, the SEC welcomes all market participants who are hungry to innovate. In accord with the PWG Report’s recommendations, I have directed the Commission staff to draft clear and simple rules of the road for crypto asset distributions, custody, and trading for public notice and comment. While the Commission staff works to finalize these regulations, the Commission and its staff will in the coming months consider using interpretative, exemptive, and other authorities to make sure that archaic rules and regulations do not smother innovation and entrepreneurship in America. Many of the Commission’s legacy rules and regulations do not make sense in the twenty-first century—let alone for on-chain markets. The Commission must revamp its rulebook so that regulatory moats do not hinder progress and competition—from both new entrants and incumbents—to the detriment of Main Street.[11] Now, Project Crypto will involve a broad range of initiatives across the Commission. First, we will work to bring crypto asset distributions back to America. The days of convoluted offshore corporate structures, decentralization theater, and confusion over security status, are over. President Trump has said that America is in its Golden Age—and under our new agenda, our crypto asset economy will be, too. In line with the PWG Report, a key priority of mine will be to establish—as swiftly as we can—a regulatory framework for distributions of crypto assets in America. Capital formation is at the heart of the SEC’s mission, yet for too long the SEC ignored market demands for choice and disincentivized crypto-based capital raising.[12] As a result, crypto markets pivoted away from offering crypto assets and deprived investors of the opportunity to use this technology to contribute to productive economic enterprises. The SEC’s head-in-the-sand posture—as well as its shoot first, ask questions later approach—are days of the past. Despite what the SEC has said in the past, most crypto assets are not securities. But confusion over the application of the “Howey test” has led some innovators to prophylactically treat all crypto assets as such. American entrepreneurs are harnessing blockchain technology to modernize a broad range of legacy systems and instruments. One such entrepreneur is Senator Bernie Moreno of Ohio, a successful businessman and freshman senator, who before his election to the Senate founded a company that put car titles on the blockchain.[13] He saw a need for efficiency in transferring titles and devised a practical solution with the new technology. These entrepreneurs need—and deserve—bright-line rules for determining whether the securities laws apply to their businesses. I have directed the Commission staff to work to develop clear guidelines that market participants can use to determine whether a crypto asset is a security or subject to an investment contract. Our goal is to help market participants to slot crypto assets into categories, such as digital collectibles, digital commodities, or stablecoins, and assess the economic realities of a transaction. This approach can allow market participants to determine, based upon clear guidelines, whether any outstanding promises or commitments of the issuer cause the crypto asset to be subject to an investment contract. In addition, it should not be a scarlet letter to be deemed a security. We need a regulatory framework for crypto asset securities that allows these products to flourish within American markets. Many issuers will prefer the flexibility in product design that the securities laws afford, and investors will benefit from the opportunity to earn distributions, voting rights, and other features typical of securities. Projects should not be forced to establish decentralized autonomous organizations and offshore foundations or decentralize too early if this is not their desired plan of action. I am excited to see new use cases for crypto asset securities in commerce, such as the ability to participate in blockchain network consensus with tokenized equities. Thus, for those crypto asset transactions that are subject to the securities laws, I have asked staff to propose purpose-fit disclosures, exemptions, and safe harbors, including for so-called “initial coin offerings,” “airdrops,” and network rewards. Regarding these sorts of transactions, our goal should be that issuers no longer exclude Americans from their distributions to avoid legal complexity and lawsuits,[14] but instead choose to include Americans to enjoy legal certainty and an accommodating regulatory environment. It is my view that a Cambrian explosion in innovation could occur if we stay true to this course. Additionally, many firms seek to “tokenize” their common stock, bonds, partnership interests, and other securities, or tokenize the securities of third parties.[15] Much of this innovation is offshore today due to regulatory challenges in the United States. I also hear from our regulatory policy staff that firms—from household names on Wall Street to unicorn tech companies in Silicon Valley—are lined up at our doors with requests to tokenize. I have asked the Commission staff to work with firms seeking to distribute tokenized securities within the United States and to provide relief where appropriate to assure that Americans are not left behind. Second, to achieve the President’s goals, it is incumbent on the SEC to ensure that market participants have maximum choice when deciding where to custody and trade crypto assets. As I have said before, the right to have self-custody of one’s private property is a core American value.[16] I believe deeply in the right to use a self-custodial digital wallet to maintain personal crypto assets and participate in on-chain activities like staking. However, some investors will continue to rely on SEC registrants, such as broker-dealers and investment advisers, to hold assets on their behalf, and these firms are subject to additional regulatory requirements when they do so. It will be a priority of my chairmanship to carry out the PWG Report’s recommendation to modernize the SEC’s custody requirements for registered intermediaries. The prior Administration’s “special-purpose broker-dealer” framework, SAB 121, and “Operation Chokepoint 2.0,” resulted in a dearth of custodial service provider options in the market today.[17] The existing custody rules were created without crypto assets in mind. I have directed the staff to consider how best to adapt the existing regime to facilitate the custody of crypto assets, including possible exemptive or other relief, in addition to changes to the rules themselves. As the PWG Report recommends, market participants “should be permitted to engage in multiple business lines under the most efficient licensing structure possible.” We should not force market participants to be stretched to fit a Procrustean bed of regulation for regulation’s sake. I am in favor of affording them the freedom to choose the most efficient regulatory framework for their business, provided that the framework adequately protects investors. Third, a key priority of my chairmanship is to allow market participants to innovate with “super-apps.”[18] I am often asked, “What do you mean by a super-app?” Plain and simple: securities intermediaries should be able to offer a broad range of products and services under one roof with a single license. A broker-dealer with an alternative trading system should be able to offer trading in non-security crypto assets alongside crypto asset securities, traditional securities, and other services, like crypto asset staking and lending, without requiring fifty-plus state licenses or multiple federal licenses. Nothing in the federal securities laws prohibits SEC-registered trading venues from listing non-securities on their platforms today, and I have directed the Commission staff to develop further guidance and proposals ultimately to make this “super-app” vision a reality. Maybe they’ll call it “Reg Super-App.” Consistent with the PWG Report, the SEC in concert with other regulators should strive to have the most efficient licensing structure for SEC registrants. They should not be unnecessarily subject to multiple regulators or regulatory regimes. This model has worked well for banks, which are broadly exempted from many duplicative regulatory frameworks, such as broker-dealer and clearing agency registration. Regulators should provide the minimum effective dose of regulation necessary to protect investors while allowing entrepreneurs and businesses to flourish. We should not overburden them with paternalistic regulation that could drive them offshore or make American companies less competitive internationally. Our regulators should unleash the forces of venue and product competition for the benefit of all Americans. We should not artificially constrain business models and impose duplicative regulatory costs on American businesses that favor the largest firms that are better able to bear the regulatory burdens. Per the PWG’s recommendations, I have directed the Commission staff to develop a framework that will allow non-security crypto assets and crypto asset securities to be traded side-by-side on SEC-regulated platforms. Additionally, I have asked the staff to evaluate the use of Commission authority to permit non-security crypto assets that are subject to an investment contract to trade on trading venues that are not registered with the Commission. I am keen to pursue such a solution, as it will not only enable state-licensed crypto asset platforms that are not registered with the SEC to list certain crypto assets, but it also clears the way for CFTC-regulated platforms to offer these products with margin capabilities—even without Congress providing the CFTC with any additional authority, unlocking even greater liquidity for these assets. Fourth, I have directed the Commission staff to update antiquated agency rules and regulations to unleash the potential of on-chain software systems in our securities markets. On-chain software comes in many shapes and sizes—some of these systems are truly decentralized and not operated by any intermediary. Other on-chain software systems have an operator. Both types of on-chain software should have a place within our financial markets. It is essential that any crypto asset regulatory market structure create a path for software developers to unleash on-chain software systems that do not require operation by any central intermediary. Decentralized finance software systems—like automated market makers—facilitate automated, non-intermediated financial market activity. Federal securities laws have always assumed the involvement of intermediaries that require regulation, but this does not mean that we should interpose intermediaries for the sake of forcing intermediation where the markets can function without them. We will create space in our markets for both models, by protecting pure publishers of software code, drawing reasonable lines to distinguish intermediated and disintermediated activity, and creating rational and workable rules of the road for intermediaries that seek to operate on-chain software systems. Decentralized finance and other forms of on-chain software systems will be part of our securities markets and not drowned out by duplicative or unnecessary regulation. To make this vision a reality, we will need to consider some changes to our rules. For example, accommodating trading of tokenized securities on-chain may require us to explore amendments to Reg NMS, in addition to what we otherwise would do in the normal course to correct market distortions that it engenders. Many of you will remember that I co-authored with Commissioner Cynthia Glassman a lengthy dissent to the adoption of Reg NMS twenty years ago last month.[19] This dissent is even more compelling now that we have had two decades of prescriptive requirements that distort market activity and impede the evolution of our securities markets. Congress clearly intended that “competitive forces, rather than unnecessary regulation, guide the development of the national market system.”[20] I will look for ways to bring us back in line with that intent and thereby promote innovation and competition in our markets. Finally, innovation and entrepreneurialism are the engines of the American economy. President Trump has described America as a “nation of builders.”[21] Under my leadership, the Commission will encourage our nation’s builders rather than constrain them with red tape and one-size-fits-all rules. While the Commission is actively considering industry requests that could jumpstart innovative activity, we are also contemplating an innovation exemption that would allow registrants and non-registrants to quickly go to market with new business models and services that do not neatly fit within our existing rules and regulations. The Commission will continue to ensure that market participants adhere to certain conditions and requirements designed to achieve the policy aims of the federal securities laws. Under my vision for an innovation exemption, innovators and visionaries will be able to immediately enter the market with new technologies and business models but will not be required to comply with incompatible or burdensome prescriptive regulatory requirements that hinder productive economic activity. Instead, they will be able to comply with certain principles-based conditions designed to achieve the core policy aims of the federal securities laws. These conditions may include, for example, a commitment to make periodic reports to the Commission, incorporate whitelisting or “verified pool” functionality, and restrict tokenized securities that do not adhere to a token standard that incorporates compliance features, such as ERC3643.[22] I encourage market participants and SEC staff alike to have an eye towards commercial viability when contemplating what various models could look like. *** As we advance these priorities, I look forward to working with my counterparts across the Administration to make the United States the crypto capital of the world. This represents more than a regulatory shift—it is a generational opportunity. From the leaves of a buttonwood tree to ledgers on a blockchain, the winds of innovation still blow—and it is our task that they carry American leadership forward. After all, ladies and gentlemen, we have never been content to follow. We will not watch from the sidelines. We will lead. We will build. And, we will ensure that the next chapter of financial innovation is written right here in America. Thank you very much for your time today. I encourage you to be attentive to our coming announcements and proposals and, as always, I welcome your thoughtful comments and suggestions.

Title: SOS — Save Our Shipping: Trump must break China’s chokehold on global trade
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/07/31/opinion/sos-trump-must-break-chinas-global-shipping-chokehold/
Time Published: 2025-07-31T23:59:58Z
Full Content:
A high-stakes deal that would give an American company a major role in running dozens of strategically crucial global ports is now in limbo — as China aggressively demands a stake. The United States cannot let that happen. US asset manager BlackRock and its partners are vying for 43 of the world’s most important shipping ports, including the two that straddle the Panama Canal. The seller is C.K. Hutchison, a major Hong Kong operator that is one of China’s “big three” port giants — and the only one not owned outright by the Chinese government. Prying these ports from China’s oversight is a critical move for both US national security and the global economy. Now the Chinese Communist Party is trying to block the deal, unless its state-owned COSCO joins the buyers’ group and gains veto rights over port operations. Alarmingly, all three main parties are reportedly open to letting that happen, apparently thinking that a compromised deal is better than no deal at all. But with all that’s at stake, President Donald Trump should use every tool available — starting with the ongoing US-China trade talks — to push the original deal through and keep COSCO out. The 43 ports that Hutchison seeks to sell would launch a global liberation from oppressive Chinese surveillance and control. If the plan falls through — or if it’s altered to add COSCO to the ownership group — China could tighten its grip on the global shipping system, by replacing a Beijing-influenced company with a Beijing-controlled one. While the media has dubbed this the “Panama Canal deal,” it’s actually much bigger. The canal, a vital artery that runs through the center of the western hemisphere, is certainly critical — but many of the other ports involved in the deal are equally so. For example, this deal would include a port inside the Malacca Strait, the only direct maritime pathway between the Indian and Pacific Oceans. It sees 90,000 ships and $3.5 trillion worth of global trade every year. Hutchison is also looking to sell five ports that it owns on both sides of the Suez Canal, the preferred maritime commercial route between the Asian and European markets. About 12% of global trade, $1 trillion a year, passes through Suez. As China’s purchases of sanctioned Iranian oil draw greater US scrutiny, Hutchison’s four ports on the southern side of the Strait of Hormuz are also critical. Nearly all Iranian oil must pass through the strait, along with oil and gas from Saudi Arabia, UAE, Iraq, Kuwait and Qatar. In Europe, Hutchison controls 13 ports that act as a key entry point for Chinese goods into the European Union. The original deal would reduce China’s port foothold on the continent — and the geopolitical influence that comes with it. Stay up on the very latest with Evening Update. Please provide a valid email address. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Never miss a story. Like all major commercial deals, this one is complicated. Apart from the two Panama Canal ports, BlackRock would retain 20% ownership of the remaining facilities; its partner, Europe-based Mediterranean Shipping Corp., would control 70%, with Singapore’s Sovereign Wealth Fund owning the rest. Meanwhile, China’s power in global shipping is massive. China produces 95% of world shipping containers and all of the refrigerated ones. Ports around the world are plugged into China’s logistical software platform, LOGINK, which tracks sensitive trade, market, maritime and passenger data. Huawei’s “Smart Port” 5G telecommunication towers provide Wi-Fi — and ready surveillance capacity — at ports worldwide. A Chinese state-owned company makes more than 70% of the world’s ship-to-shore cranes (and 80% of the cranes used in America) — a major risk, according to the House Homeland Security Committee, which has alleged those cranes may be engaging in covert surveillance on behalf of the CCP. Adding state-owned COSCO to ports deal would give the CCP the power to veto any attempts to replace Huawei towers, LOGINK systems, Chinese cranes or other tools that may already be spying on behalf of the state. With BlackRock’s minority interest in the vast bulk of these ports, replacing a private Chinese company with a state-owned one is even worse for the United States than the status quo. Breaking China’s maritime monopoly is urgent. At the same time, America’s economic leverage has never been higher. As Beijing trumps up patently absurd anti-monopoly investigations to stall or scuttle the BlackRock-MSC deal, the United States should Trump right back. He must make the choice clear: Access to American markets cannot continue unless Beijing releases its maritime monopoly.

Title: Biden Aide Mike Donilon Claims He Had No Clue About Autopen

Mike Donilon, a senior advisor to former President Joe Biden, told congressional investigators he had no knowledge of the autopen or its use, a source familiar with his testimony told the Daily Caller. Donilon appeared Thursday before the House Oversight Committee as part of Chairman James Comer’s probe into Biden’s mental fitness and the administration’s use of the autopen. He had advised Biden since 1981, serving as a pollster, strategist and media consultant during Biden’s Senate tenure, according to his Harvard Institute of Politics biography. (RELATED: ‘A Great Candidate For Republicans’: James Comer Has Fun Predicting Kamala’s Future Job Prospects) Mike Donilon is in the hot seat today. Let’s get some answers. https://t.co/vN39PdlGZ1 — Oversight Committee (@GOPoversight) July 31, 2025 Donilon told the committee he stood to make $8 million from Biden’s reelection bid — half already paid out, with the rest contingent on a 2024 victory. He reportedly downplayed concerns over Biden’s debate performance, saying critics in the media and on Capitol Hill had overreacted. He conceded the former president’s presence was sometimes diminished and that he occasionally stumbled over words, but expressed frustration with the public’s fixation on Biden’s appearance. Donilon reiterated he had no knowledge of the autopen or how it was used. He previously served as counselor to then-Vice President Biden and led strategy, polling, messaging, advertising and speechwriting for Biden’s 2020 and 2024 campaigns.

(RELATED: House Oversight Committee Votes To Subpoena Ghislaine Maxwell For Deposition) Ricchetti and Donilon followed former Chief of Staff Ron Klain, who sat for several hours of questioning last week. Meanwhile, several close Biden associates — including former White House physician Kevin O’Connor, Jill Biden’s ex-chief of staff Anthony Bernal, and former aide Annie Tomasini — have recently invoked the Fifth Amendment before the committee.

Title: [EU] Ghosts of K'aresh Content Update Notes
URL: https://www.bluetracker.gg/wow/topic/eu-en/24226698-ghosts-of-k-aresh-content-update-notes/
Time Published: 2025-07-31T21:00:58Z

Journey deeper into The War Within campaign in the Ghosts of K’aresh content update arriving on 6 August. Explore a new zone, break ground in a new Delve, make an impact in Ecological Succession, and more. The War Within Season 3 also kicks off on 13 August with a new raid, new Mythic+ dungeon pool, and a fresh PvP season. In Ghosts of K’aresh, the campaign continues as more pieces to a troubling puzzle fall into place. With the release of this content update players will be able to immerse themselves in The War Within story as it leads up to the next chapter of the Worldsoul Saga—Midnight. There’s some unfinished business to be had on K’aresh and the specter of an old enemy looms large. Forces with ill-intent are determined to bring forth Dimensius, the All-Devouring once more to finish off the ethereals. Should he arise, Azeroth will also be in peril from this dangerous Void Lord. Home of the ethereals, K'aresh was once a vibrant world, but now it only exists as a fragmented void-touched world waiting for players to explore what remains of this little-known land. Though there are multiple points of interest for heroes to explore, including ethereal Eco-Domes where life still thrives. With shadowy forces working toward bringing Dimensius back into the world, players will need to gather their allies in a bid to put a stop to him and his followers. [LEARN MORE] Not just a dungeon in the Ghosts of K’aresh content update, Tazavesh, the Veiled Market has been brought from the Shadowlands to serve as a home base for adventurers. Glowing glimmering shields of energy protect the city from the dangers of the cosmos beyond allowing the many survivors of this land to have a degree of safety behind them. Once inside the market, find vendors, more quests, and portals. There are even portals to each of the four daily active Bountiful Delves. A coalition of Broker cartels and ethereals formed to accomplish an impossible goal—save their destroyed world from the All-Devouring. The K'aresh Trust is the seventh major faction of The War Within, and is based out of Tazavesh, located in what remains of K'aresh. Harness the power of the ethereals and see the world through their eyes. An artifact cloak, Reshii Wraps, can be used to transform into an energy form, much like the ethereals, to interact with the world in a new way. You'll use these wraps to take on a new type of content—Phase Diving— as well as use them in the Manaforge Omega raid, the open world, delves, and more! [LEARN MORE] Reshii wraps will upgrade and scale with you, including new visuals as you progress through the content. Enter untethered space by using your Reshii Wraps to experience a whole new aspect of K’aresh. You’ll experience new creatures, objectives, world quests, and some new mechanics all within this overlay of the world. You can expect to see anything you normally would in the world such as treasures, rare creatures, or objects, but there will also be some unique opportunities to be found such as Warrants. Aid the constable of Tazavesh by hunting down notorious monsters for fun… and profit. Help Ve’nari bring life back to K’aresh with her eco-domes. You’ll help fill them with creatures that thrive within the ecosystem. You’ll scour previously traveled zones to bring back animals to live within the eco-domes and aid them in adjusting to life on K’aresh. It’s up to you to help transform this barren eco-dome into one filled with life and promise for a new future. [LEARN MORE] Manaforge Omega, built to harness arcane power from the wastes of K’aresh, now hums with a sinister radiance. Within it, Nexus-King Salhadaar attempts to reawaken Dimensius, the All-Devouring, in a bid for ultimate power. The champions of Azeroth must disrupt Manaforge Omega’s operations or else risk a reborn Dimensius feasting on reality itself. [LEARN MORE] Raid Bosses Those bold enough to vanquish Dimensius, the All-Devouring, will earn the prestigious Royal Voidwing on Heroic difficulty—and for those who conquer him on Mythic, the elusive Unbound Star-Eater awaits. Upper Left: Royal Voidwing Lower Right: Unbound Star-Eater Manaforge Omega will also have a Raid Renown Track called Manaforge Vandals, similar to the Gallagio Loyalty Rewards Club, filled with rewards like The Bone Freezer mount, and buffs to use once inside the raid. Dungeon Bosses The new seasonal rewards for Mythic+ include the two new titles: "the Unbound" and "the Unbound Hero", dungeon teleports, and two mounts: Azure Void Flyer and Scarlet Void Flyer. Scarlet Void Flyer Starting the week of August 12th, Tazavesh will also return as a full hard mode mega-dungeon and will count as a Mythic+10 once a week in the Great Vault. This mega-dungeon replaces the Mythic 0 difficulty for the season for both Tazavesh dungeons, and can be accessed by entering the Tazavesh instance and with all players in the party interacting with Al'dalil near the dungeon entrance to confirm they're ready to proceed. All bosses have a chance to drop Hero track loot, and completing the mega-dungeon will also grant players 30 Gilded Crests. An additional weekly reward is available for players who are able to defeat all bosses in the mega-dungeon without anyone in the party dying. Checkpoints are also evolving into Waystones, with a more visual representation of unlock checkpoints. A new icon will appear on the map showing you where Waystones within the zone can be found as well. Found within the Azure Vaults within the Dragon Isles, you’ll encounter ethereals, ethereal pirates, and brokers who are plundering the Delve. Upgrading and using the Reshii Wraps unlocks unique challenge gateways to powerful bosses and reveals hidden secrets when you revisit your favorite delves across Khaz Algar. You may also get a glimpse of your friends within the Delve as well or even /mourn them as you observe their ghost from where they died. There’s unfinished business with Nexus Princess Ky’veza as well and you’ll take her on one on one as this season's Nemesis.

Journey deeper into The War Within campaign in the Ghosts of K’aresh content update arriving on August 5. Explore a new zone, break ground in a new Delve, make an impact in Ecological Succession, and more. The War Within Season 3 also kicks off on August 12 with a new raid, new Mythic+ dungeon pool, and a fresh PvP season. In Ghosts of K’aresh, the campaign continues as more pieces to a troubling puzzle fall into place. With the release of this content update players will be able to immerse themselves in The War Within story as it leads up to the next chapter of the Worldsoul Saga—Midnight. There’s some unfinished business to be had on K’aresh and the specter of an old enemy looms large. Forces with ill-intent are determined to bring forth Dimensius, the All-Devouring once more to finish off the ethereals. Should he arise, Azeroth will also be in peril from this dangerous Void Lord. Home of the ethereals, K'aresh was once a vibrant world, but now it only exists as a fragmented void-touched world waiting for players to explore what remains of this little-known land. Though there are multiple points of interest for heroes to explore, including ethereal Eco-Domes where life still thrives. With shadowy forces working toward bringing Dimensius back into the world, players will need to gather their allies in a bid to put a stop to him and his followers. [LEARN MORE] Not just a dungeon in the Ghosts of K’aresh content update, Tazavesh, the Veiled Market has been brought from the Shadowlands to serve as a home base for adventurers. Glowing glimmering shields of energy protect the city from the dangers of the cosmos beyond allowing the many survivors of this land to have a degree of safety behind them. Once inside the market, find vendors, more quests, and portals. There are even portals to each of the four daily active Bountiful Delves. A coalition of Broker cartels and ethereals formed to accomplish an impossible goal—save their destroyed world from the All-Devouring. The K'aresh Trust is the seventh major faction of The War Within, and is based out of Tazavesh, located in what remains of K'aresh. Harness the power of the ethereals and see the world through their eyes. An artifact cloak, Reshii Wraps, can be used to transform into an energy form, much like the ethereals, to interact with the world in a new way. You'll use these wraps to take on a new type of content—Phase Diving— as well as use them in the Manaforge Omega raid, the open world, delves, and more! [LEARN MORE] Reshii wraps will upgrade and scale with you, including new visuals as you progress through the content. Enter untethered space by using your Reshii Wraps to experience a whole new aspect of K’aresh. You’ll experience new creatures, objectives, world quests, and some new mechanics all within this overlay of the world. You can expect to see anything you normally would in the world such as treasures, rare creatures, or objects, but there will also be some unique opportunities to be found such as Warrants. Aid the constable of Tazavesh by hunting down notorious monsters for fun… and profit. Help Ve’nari bring life back to K’aresh with her eco-domes. You’ll help fill them with creatures that thrive within the ecosystem. You’ll scour previously traveled zones to bring back animals to live within the eco-domes and aid them in adjusting to life on K’aresh. It’s up to you to help transform this barren eco-dome into one filled with life and promise for a new future. [LEARN MORE] Manaforge Omega, built to harness arcane power from the wastes of K’aresh, now hums with a sinister radiance. Within it, Nexus-King Salhadaar attempts to reawaken Dimensius, the All-Devouring, in a bid for ultimate power. The champions of Azeroth must disrupt Manaforge Omega’s operations or else risk a reborn Dimensius feasting on reality itself. [LEARN MORE] Raid Bosses Those bold enough to vanquish Dimensius, the All-Devouring, will earn the prestigious Royal Voidwing on Heroic difficulty—and for those who conquer him on Mythic, the elusive Unbound Star-Eater awaits. Upper Left: Royal Voidwing Lower Right: Unbound Star-Eater Manaforge Omega will also have a Raid Renown Track called Manaforge Vandals, similar to the Gallagio Loyalty Rewards Club, filled with rewards like The Bone Freezer mount, and buffs to use once inside the raid. Dungeon Bosses The new seasonal rewards for Mythic+ include the two new titles: "the Unbound" and "the Unbound Hero", dungeon teleports, and two mounts: Azure Void Flyer and Scarlet Void Flyer. Scarlet Void Flyer Starting the week of August 12th, Tazavesh will also return as a full hard mode mega-dungeon and will count as a Mythic+10 once a week in the Great Vault. This mega-dungeon replaces the Mythic 0 difficulty for the season for both Tazavesh dungeons, and can be accessed by entering the Tazavesh instance and with all players in the party interacting with Al'dalil near the dungeon entrance to confirm they're ready to proceed. All bosses have a chance to drop Hero track loot, and completing the mega-dungeon will also grant players 30 Gilded Crests. An additional weekly reward is available for players who are able to defeat all bosses in the mega-dungeon without anyone in the party dying. Checkpoints are also evolving into Waystones, with a more visual representation of unlock checkpoints. A new icon will appear on the map showing you where Waystones within the zone can be found as well. Found within the Azure Vaults within the Dragon Isles, you’ll encounter ethereals, ethereal pirates, and brokers who are plundering the Delve.

Title: A 13% Dividends From AI? Here Are The Tickers
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelfoster/2025/07/31/a-13-dividends-from-ai-here-are-the-tickers/
Time Published: 2025-07-31T21:00:00Z
Full Content:
ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster, Contributor. By now you’ve no doubt heard the argument that AI is a bubble, and there’s no way Big Tech will make a significant profit from it, given the massive amounts of cash they’ve already piled in. That take is just plain wrong—truth is, the tech giants are already booking profits from AI. And we closed-end fund (CEF) investors can grab our share at a discount—and at dividend rates running all the way up to 13%, too. This next chart tells us straight-up why the “AI-is-unprofitable” theory is off the mark. Look at the far left of this chart and you see that communication-services stocks led in profit growth in the second quarter of 2025. Alphabet (GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (META) are both titans of that sector, and both have invested billions in AI. They’ve largely done it by buying chips and other hardware, as well as software, from IT firms like NVIDIA (NVDA). That pop in communication-services earnings proves that these companies are profiting from AI. Similarly, the second-highest earnings gains in the chart above, in IT, confirms that AI actually does make money for Big Tech. When it comes to high-yielding, tech-focused CEFs, there are basically four tickers that income investors look to. Let’s check in on those now. As you can see in the chart below, all four of these funds’ net asset values have been roaring higher, with the 12.3%-yielding BlackRock Science and Technology Term Trust (BSTZ), in green, leading by a small amount over the last three months. It’s followed closely by its sister fund, the 7.7%-yielding BlackRock Science and Technology Trust (BST), in purple. The BlackRock Technology and Private Equity Term Trust (BTX), with its huge 13% yield (in blue), and the Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund (STK), (in orange and paying 6%) bring up the rear. The interesting thing, however, is the fact that these funds still trade at discounts to net asset value (NAV). The best values are the three BlackRock funds (again in green, blue and purple): We’ve seen BSTZ’s discount remain basically where it was three months ago, despite its strong NAV return in that time, while BST’s discount has widened slightly, despite its strong performance. The third BlackRock tech CEF, the BlackRock Technology and Private Equity Term Trust (BTX), has seen its discount narrow slightly (April was a great time to buy BTX). The Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund (STK) is the priciest of our quartet, but context matters here, as its premium to NAV, which it has held for much of the last decade, suddenly disappeared. Let’s stick with STK for a bit. Despite that fund’s smaller discount, is it still worth our time? I’d say yes, given the next chart. But there is a caveat that we’ll get into shortly. Before we get to that, we see that STK, whose NAV (in purple above) has closely matched the NASDAQ 100 (whose benchmark index fund is shown in orange) over the last decade. That makes STK a good way to get tech exposure, plus the index’s diversification. I mention that diversification because STK is tech-heavy, with core names like Microsoft (MSFT), NVIDIA and Apple (AAPL). But like the NASDAQ, it also branches out a bit, with holdings in companies like Visa (V) and Bloom Energy (BE), which focuses on products that help customers generate power on-site. On the dividend side, STK’s 6% yield far outruns the NASDAQ’s 0.5%, and the CEF has also never cut its payouts. However, STK is contending with funds yielding a lot more—up to 13% in the case of the highest-paying BlackRock fund, BTX. That’s the real reason for STK’s growing discount: Even though it was swept up in the tech rally, its lower payouts aren’t enough for many income investors, now that there’s more competition, plus dividends that nearly double STK’s 6% yield, among tech CEFs. This is why the bigger discounts offered by the BlackRock funds are the better deals here, and why STK’s discount isn’t yet big enough to warrant our attention.

Title: Panama says it could take over ports as it threatens to upend $20B deal with BlackRock, MSC
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/07/31/business/panama-says-state-could-take-over-ports-as-it-threatens-to-upend-20b-deal-with-blackrock-msc/
Time Published: 2025-07-31T20:47:24Z
Full Content:
Panama’s President Jose Raul Mulino said Thursday the Central American nation could potentially take over two key ports along the canal — a move that would scupper US asset manager BlackRock’s bid to gain control of the vital shipping lane. Mulino asked the nation’s top court to scrap a contract with current operator CK Hutchison, which would then allow Panama to forge its own public-private partnerships for the two ports. CK Hutchison has agreed to a $20 billion deal to hand over more than 40 global ports owned by Hong Kong business magnate Li Ka-Shing to BlackRock and Mediterranean Shipping Company. CK Hutchison owns a 90% stake in Panama Ports Company, which has given it control over the Balboa and Cristobal ports located at both ends of the canal. It renewed that agreement – planned to last 25 years – in 2021, but has since proposed a sale of the ports to appease President Trump’s demands for the US to “take back” the waterway, citing national security concerns. While Italian billionaire Gianluigi Aponte’s family-run business MSC is slated to be the lead investor, the two Panama ports included in the deal will go to BlackRock, according to Bloomberg. Panama’s Comptroller General’s office filed two lawsuits this week asking the Supreme Court to declare the sale unconstitutional and to nullify its contract with CK Hutchison, claiming the operator did not follow required steps – like getting it greenlit by the comptroller. “I do not at the moment see the continuation of the Panama Ports contract, amended or not,” Mulino said at a press conference Thursday. “We will wait for the verdict,” Mulino added on the lawsuits. MSC, CK Hutchison and the White House did not immediately respond to The Post’s requests for comment. BlackRock declined to comment. It’s not the first time Panama’s comptroller has taken aim at its contract with CK Hutchison, arguing that there were irregularities from the previous government and that the deal has brought insufficient revenue to Panama. The results of a recent audit by the comptroller’s office have not been released.

China has also pushed back hard against the BlackRock deal, fearful of losing critical access to the Panama Canal. Beijing officials have threatened to squash the sale unless Cosco, China’s largest shipping firm, gets a stake equal to those of BlackRock and MSC, according to the Wall Street Journal. Tensions have continued to heat up as China and the US negotiate on a trade deal. Panama’s government said state partnerships could also solve the problem of a key copper mine previously operated by Canada’s First Quantum Minerals, whose contract was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 2023. “The idea is still a draft, covering the ports and the mine through partnerships with the state,” Mulino said.

Title: Panama Brings 'Abusive' Ports Contract with China-Linked Company to Supreme Court

Comptroller General of Panama Anel Flores filed two separate lawsuits on Wednesday against a contract between the country and Panama Ports Company (PPC), a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based Hutchison Port Holdings, over the “abusive” contract that grants PPC control of two ports at the Panama Canal. The lawsuits, filed at Panama’s Supreme Court of Justice (CSJ), demand that the decades-old contract be rendered null and void over the “many irregularities” that his office found in detriment of national interests during a months-long audit of the company and its management of the two ports. “The duty of this Comptroller’s Office is to defend the money of Panamanians and always be on the side of the best national interest,” Flores said during a press conference presenting the lawsuits on Wednesday. “That is why today we are referring directly to the Supreme Court, appealing to them as the Panamanian State and as comptroller in these two lawsuits. We hope they will be admitted promptly and that we will have the results that the country obviously needs and that the citizens are waiting for.” Since 1997, PPC, a subsidiary of Hutchison Port Holdings, has administered two ports located at opposite ends of the Panama Canal. One of the ports is located at the Pacific entrance to the canal in Balboa and the other on the Atlantic side of the trade route in Cristóbal, in the province of Colón. At the time, the administration of former Panamanian President Ernesto Pérez Balladares granted a 25-year lease to PPC for the management and administration of the two ports. The original 1997 contract reportedly contained automatic lease renewal provisions invoked in 2021 to grant PPC an additional 25-year lease period that will run through 2047. Flores, who took office in 2024, claimed in April that the renewal did not have the endorsement of the Office of the Comptroller General, refuting statements issued by his predecessor Gerardo Solís, who claimed otherwise. The two ports have been at the center of an ongoing debate started by President Donald Trump last year after he called for the United States to regain control of the Panama Canal — which the United States originally built and ceded to Panama in 1999. President Trump and several members of his administration have denounced China’s alleged growing influence in the country and control of the interoceanic trade route. International outlets have described PPC’s parent company, HK-based Hutchison Port Holdings, as an “example” of China’s presence in the trade route after the Chinese communist regime ended the “One Country, Two Systems” policy in 2020 that prevented Beijing from imposing communist laws in Hong Kong through a “national security” law intended to suppress democratic protests. The law effectively outlawed anti-communist dissent and imposed Beijing’s law, which gives the Party total control over supposedly “private” businesses. The Office of Panama’s Comptroller General has audited PPC during the past year over its management of the two ports. The audit reportedly revealed evidence of multiple breaches of contract that amounted to more than $300 million in losses to Panamanian state coffers. At the time, Comptroller Flores accused Panama’s Maritime Authority (AMP) of misrepresenting financial figures related to PPC and its management of the ports. Flores stressed during his press conference that Panama’s relationship with PPC has been “harmful” and his office seeks to correct the “historical damage” caused to the Central American nation. The comptroller general said he hopes that the nation’s Supreme Court promptly admits both lawsuits and that the judicial process yields results that “respond to the public outcry.” “We Panamanians do not agree with or approve of what the country has been through,” Flores reportedly said. Flores denounced this year that, despite the growth in container traffic in the country, the economic benefits for Panama resulting from the PPC lease deal have been “minimal” and described the situation as a “colonial enclave that perpetuates economic inequalities.” In February, Panama’s Attorney General Luis Carlos Gómez deemed the PPC contract “unconstitutional,” arguing that its terms stood in violation of fundamental principles of Panama’s constitution. At press time, Hutchison Port Holdings’ parent company CK Hutchison Holding is undergoing negotiations with asset manager Blackrock and other companies over the sale of the two ports as part of a broader sale of 43 ports spread across 23 countries. Panamanian President José Raul Mulino expressed his support for Comptroller General Flores’ legal action in remarks given during a press conference Thursday morning. Mulino denounced the contract, its 2021 renewal, and how much it has “cost” the country. “The Comptroller’s lawsuit, which I fully support, is well justified. We have all seen what that contract has cost the Panamanian nation over time. What we have not gained from it, apart from the fact that we are 10-percent shareholders, is a very, very paltry sum,” Mulino said. “When that contract was renewed for another 25 years, the Comptroller did not endorse it,” he continued, “and that is what is being challenged in court, the nullity of the contract because it was not endorsed as all contracts between the State and any third party must be endorsed.” On the subject of C.K. Hutchinson’s sale of the Balboa and Cristóbal ports, Mulino said that the negotiation “is at a standstill as far as we know.” “Remember that this is a broad process. There are 41 ports around the world that are being sold, and the two ports in Panama are in a separate process. So one thing has nothing to do with the other,” Mulino said. “The Republic of Panama will definitely adopt a port policy which we will announce in due course with the aim of enforcing what I mentioned about the canal,” he continued, “a coherent maritime and logistics strategy for the Panamanian state, in all its services, civil servants, etcetera, so that we can truly take advantage of the privilege of our strategic geographical position.” Christian K.

Join the leading maritime news network A view of the Balboa Port is pictured after Hong Kong's CK Hutchison agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a BlackRock Inc-backed consortium, amid pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to curb China's influence in the region, Panama City, Panama, March 4, 2025. REUTERS/Enea Lebrun PANAMA CITY, July 31 (Reuters) – Public-private partnerships could take over two key ports near the Panama Canal if courts invalidate a contract with Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison‘s to operate them, Panama’s President Jose Raul Mulino said on Thursday. CK Hutchison holds a 90% stake in the local Panama Ports Company, which had a 25-year concession to operate the Balboa and Cristobal ports, located at both ends of the canal, renewed in 2021. The contract has been at the center of a dispute since U.S. President Donald Trump this year threatened to take over the waterway due to China’s influence over Panama’s maritime industry. CK Hutchison is trying to sell its stake in the Panamanian company as part of a massive global deal. Two suits were filed with the Supreme Court this week by Panama’s Comptroller General’s office, aiming to declare the agreement unconstitutional and to nullify the contract on the basis the renewal did not follow required legal steps, including the Comptroller’s greenlight. “I do not at the moment see the continuation of the Panama Ports contract, amended or not,” Mulino told a press conference. “We will wait for the verdict,” Mulino added, referring to the lawsuits. The comptroller has openly criticized the contract over alleged irregularities by the previous government and insufficient revenue to Panama from the deal, but the full results of a recent audit by his office have not been revealed. The legal challenges the contract is facing in Panama are adding troubles to a diplomatically sensitive plan from a consortium led by U.S. asset manager BlackRock BLK.N to buy a large portion of CK Hutchison’s global ports business, a possible deal that has been celebrated by Washington but criticized in China. The deal has become increasingly politicized amid a U.S.-China trade war. Beijing argues it has significant national interests in the transaction and the proposed deal would be a betrayal of the country. Panama’s government is also seeing partnerships with the state as a solution for the operation of a key copper mine previously operated by Canada’s First Quantum Minerals FM.TO, whose contract was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 2023. “The idea is still a draft, covering the ports and the mine through partnerships with the state,” Mulino said.
