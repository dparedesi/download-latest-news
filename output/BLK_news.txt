A man whose son was beaten to death before his body was dumped in a woodland has said the murderers did not show “one bit of remorse for what they did” despite listening to “horror stories” in court during their trial. The family of Kieran Quilligan (47) delivered victim impact statements at the Central Criminal Court in Cork on Wednesday as Niall Long (33) and Luke Taylor (28) were sentenced to life imprisonment by Ms Justice Siobhán Lankford. Long, formerly of St Michael’s Close, Mahon, Cork, and Taylor, formerly of Cherry Lawn, Blackrock, Cork, pleaded not guilty to murdering Mr Quilligan on a date unknown between September 1st, 2023 and January 29th, 2024. However, a jury found them both guilty of murder. Mr Quilligan’s mother, Catherine O’Flynn, his father Stephen Quilligan, and his partner, Colette O’Driscoll, on Wednesday told the court how Mr Quilligan’s death had affected them. Ms O’Flynn said the family clung on to the hope that Kieran was still alive after he disappeared from his flat in Cork city on September 1st, 2023, and that it was all just a bad dream from which they would one day wake up. “I remember the months unfolding. How could I forget? Each day the weather conditions were getting worse – it felt like there were never so many storms. I’d stare out the windows thinking ‘God love him – he is out there in all this’, while still clinging to the hope he was still alive," she said. “We were living in a world of loss, fear and hope until January 29th, 2024 when Kieran’s skeletal remains were found. Our hearts were broken in a million pieces – our worst nightmare come true,” added Ms O’Flynn, who said that if her love could have saved her son, he would still be alive. Stephen Quilligan said they knew foul play had been involved in Kieran’s disappearance, but it was not until they sat through the murder trial and heard the evidence that they realised the full horror of what had happened. “We were shocked, angry, in disbelief that someone could do this to another person and pretend like nothing happened,” he said. “For the last three weeks we have sat here listening to horror stories about my son and the two defendants didn’t show one bit of remorse for what they did.” He thanked An Garda Síochána for not giving up when searching for Kieran and treating him “like a human being”. Ms O’Driscoll said she adored Kieran and they had been told before his disappearance that they were to be housed together. “Kieran was going to get the keys to his long-awaited castle,” she said. Det Garda Ann O’Sullivan outlined the background to the murder. She said Long and Taylor killed Mr Quilligan in retaliation for an incident earlier on September 1st, 2023 when Mr Quilligan and another man had robbed Long of drugs and cash in Cork city centre. The three men were known to each other as they were users of heroin and crack cocaine. Taylor lured Mr Quilligan from his flat on Anderson’s Quay to St Finbarr’s Place, where he was attacked by him and Long before being bundled into the boot of a Toyota Rav 4. Gardaí were able to link the vehicle to Long and tracked it driving to the Little Island area, where they dumped Mr Quilligan’s body off a farmyard. Gardaí tracked the vehicle returning there three days later, when the defendants collected and moved Mr Quilligan’s body. Garda were able to track the vehicle’s movements to Whitewell, Rostellan near Midleton. A search of the area by a cadaver dog on January 29th, 2024 led them to Mr Quilligan’s skeletal remains, which had been dumped in a gravel bag in low lying forestry. Det Garda O’Sullivan said Assistant State Pathologist Dr Margot Bolster was unable to give a cause of death because of the long interval between Mr Quilligan’s death and the postmortem. She testified that many of Mr Quilligan’s fractures were “suggestive of a blow with a blunt instrument like a hammer and there is no doubt at all they are consistent with a severe and significant assault”.

TWO MEN HAVE been sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of a man whose skeletal remains were found in a jute bag in scrubland in east Cork. A jury of ten men and two women found Luke Taylor (28) and Niall Long (33) guilty of the murder of Kieran Quilligan last week following a three-week trial at the Central Criminal Court in Cork. Kieran Quilligan (47) was missing for five months when his remains were found in a ravine at Whitewell, Rostellan on 29 January 2024. He had suffered nineteen broken bones after being attacked with fists and a hammer-like object. Gardaí had brought a PSNI cadaver dog to an area of interest to the investigation in east Cork where they discovered the remains in a one tonne gravel bag. At a sentencing hearing in Cork today, Stephen Quilligan, father of the late Kieran Quilligan, said that the two perpetrators, whom he referred to as “monsters”, would never be forgiven for what they had done. Mr Quilligan said that he knew that there was foul play involved when his son disappeared without trace on 1 September 2023. “It all started for us two years ago and it has been a nightmare of our family ever since. We want to thank the gardaí who never gave up. They said they would bring Kieran home and they did,” he said. “Due to the nature of this case, any time we asked what was going on, the gardaí could not tell us. We were told when the case would come up in court, everything would come out. “We were hearing what really went on for the first time and were shocked, angry and in disbelief that someone could do this to another person and pretend like nothing happened.” Mr Quilligan said that it was beyond difficult to listen to the “horror stories” that emerged over the course of the trial. He said that the defendants didn’t show “one bit of remorse” for murdering his son. He added that Kieran was a “loving son, brother and uncle” before thanking the gardaí and the prosecution team for treating Kieran “like a human being.” Catherine O’Flynn, the mother of Kieran Quilligan, said he was “adored” by his family. “Kieran had the biggest heart you ever seen. His birthday, 13 July 2023, was the last time I saw Kieran. If I had known what was going to happen I would never have left him leave the house,” she said. “I will never forgive them (Niall Long and Luke Taylor) for what they have put our family through.” Colette O’Driscoll, the partner of Kieran Quilligan, said that he left their home on 1 September 2023 and she never saw him again. Advertisement “Niall Long and Luke Taylor stole my future with the man I loved, adored and cherished.” She said that herself and Kieran were set to move in to their forever home when he was violently taken from this world. “Kieran was going to get the keys to his long awaited castle. Now unfortunately Kieran will never get the keys to his castle.” Whilst sentencing Luke Taylor and Niall Long to mandatory life imprisonment, Ms Justice Siobhan Lankford praised gardaí for the “exemplary” manner in which they carried out their comprehensive investigation. She said that the perpetrators might well have never been found other than for the enormous work of investigating gardaí. She also paid tribute to members of the Quilligan family for the manner in which they had conducted themselves in “difficult circumstances.” Ms Justice Lankford added that Kieran Quilligan was taken from this world in the “most egregious circumstances.” At the start of the sentencing hearing today, the coordinator of the Garda investigation, Det Garda Ann O’Sullivan of the Bridewell Garda Station in Cork, said that the two men subjected Kieran Quilligan to a “significant and sustained assault” on 1 September 2023. They then bundled him in to the boot of a car and brought him to a farmyard in Little Island. His body was then moved to the scrubland in Rostellan. She detailed the extensive harvesting of CCTV in the case which led gardaí to find the body of Kieran Quilligan and determine the identity of his killers. During the trial Prosecution senior counsel, Donal O’Sullivan, told the jury that the “instigating factor” for the murder was Kieran Quilligan stealing drugs and cash from Niall Long on 1 September 2023. Meanwhile, in the course of the trial the jurors heard evidence from Assistant State Pathologist, Dr Margaret Bolster who carried out a postmortem examination on the late Kieran Quilligan. Dr Bolster indicated that an exact cause of death could not be established because decomposition had led to the loss of organs. However, she stated that what was not at doubt was that the injuries suffered by Kieran Quilligan were consistent with a “severe assault.” Those injuries included fractures to his ribs, leg and hand bones, jaw bones and skull. Dr Bolster said whilst the remains were skeletonised there was a small piece of skin remaining which consisted of a tattoo with the word “Mother” and a date. The skull was separate from the body and there was a large amount of silt and vegetation. Father-of-two Niall Long is formerly of St Michael’s Close in Mahon in Cork, whilst Luke Taylor is previously of Cherry Lawn in Blackrock in Cork. Kieran Quilligan was living with his partner in Simon Community housing in Cork city at the time of his death.

German crypto and digital asset manager Deutsche Digital Assets (DDA) and Nordic cryptocurrency exchange Safello have announced the launch of the Safello Bittensor Staked TAO ETP. The launch comes as the crypto industry welcomes a growing number of digital asset-related products across the market, including the Bitcoin ETP by BlackRock. Meanwhile, Bittensor continues to attract attention as a top decentralized artificial intelligence (AI) project. Developments around AI, including from Big Tech giants Nvidia, Microsoft and Meta, have often pushed TAO and other AI tokens into the limelight. Frankfurt-based DDA, a pioneer in crypto exchange-traded products since 2017, announced the new product on October 29, 2025. The ETP is a collaboration with Safello and brings a physically backed Bittensor ETP to the expanding market. The product tracks the Kaiko Safello Staked Bittensor Index (KSSTAO) and is domiciled in Liechtenstein. Trading under ticker STAO (ISIN: DE000A4APQY4) on SIX is slated to commence to enhance seamless buying and selling during standard market hours. Moreover, the ETP is fully secured in cold storage by regulated custodian BitGo Europe GmbH and holds 100% physical TAO reserves. Investors are to benefit from total returns encompassing TAO’s price appreciation plus staking yields, automatically reinvested into the net asset value (NAV). With a competitive total expense ratio (TER) of 1.49%, it provides an accumulating income structure, ideal for portfolio diversification amid rising interest in AI-driven blockchain assets. Maximilian Lautenschläger, CEO and founder of DDA, emphasized the strategic fit: “We are excited to announce the launch of Safello Bittensor Staked TAO ETP through our collaboration with Safello. By leveraging DDA’s white-label ETP platform, we enable our partner to bring their innovative crypto investment strategies to market, while ensuring compliance with regulatory standards.” Bittensor (TAO) is currently trading at $425 and powers a groundbreaking peer-to-peer network, incentivizing collaborative machine learning. Participants contribute data, models, and compute power for tasks like image recognition, fraud detection, and protein structure prediction, earning TAO rewards in a proof-of-stake ecosystem. With a market cap exceeding $4.3 billion, Bittensor exemplifies the fusion of blockchain and AI, positioning it as a high-growth asset in the evolving digital economy. Safello CEO Emelie Moritz commented, “The launch of Safello Bittensor Staked TAO ETP underlines Safello’s conviction in decentralised AI. Bittensor is a prime example of how decentralized technology and AI are converging to reshape the future of value creation. Together with DDA, we’re making it possible for investors to easily access this innovation through a regulated and transparent investment vehicle.” Bittensor price reached highs of $457 on Oct. 29, but its all-time high is $767, which it hit back in April 2024.

Paschal Sheehy Southern Editor Two men have been jailed for life for the murder of another man whose skeletal remains were found in a gravel bag in a ravine in east Cork, five months after he went missing. A jury at the Central Criminal Court in Cork had been told Kieran Quilligan was lured to a laneway near Cork city centre before he was ambushed and beaten to death. Mr Quilligan was 47 years of age and was originally from Togher in Cork city. He went missing from St Finbarr's Place in Cork on the evening of 1 September 2023. Prosecuting Senior Counsel Donal O'Sullivan told the Central Criminal Court jury he had been lured to the laneway before he was ambushed. The State's case was that 28-year-old Luke Taylor, originally from Cherry Lawn, Blackrock, in Cork, was the one who lured Mr Quilligan to the laneway. Mr Quilligan was alleged to have stolen drugs and cash from a second man earlier in the day, 33-year-old Niall Long, originally from St Michael's Close in Mahon in Cork. Niall Long, it was alleged, ambushed him before he was beaten to death in retaliation for the earlier robbery. Both men were convicted of Mr Quilligan's murder by a jury last week. Their trial was told that gardaí undertook extensive searches for Mr Quilligan in east Cork, after CCTV tracked them travelling there immediately after he disappeared. His skeletal remains were found five months later by a cadaver dog, as part of a garda search. A post-mortem examination was unable to identify a cause of death for Mr Quilligan. But pathologist Dr Margot Bolster established he had been attacked with a weapon like a hammer and suffered fractures to his skull, neck and jaw, his hand, his leg, his chest and his ribs.

"The anger and frustration was unbearable for our family," he said. "We want to thank the gardai who never gave up. They told us they would bring Kieran home and they did. "Kieran was a loving son, brother and uncle. He is sadly missed by all of us and our lives will never be the same without him." Mr Quilligan's mother, Catherine O'Flynn, said he was missed, loved and adored. "If my love could have saved you, you would still be here with us," she said.

"I have a heavy heart. I miss my best friend every day. I feel lonely without him," she said. Sentencing both men to life in prison, Ms Justice Siobhan Lankford said Mr Quilligan's life had been taken in most egregious circumstances. She described the garda investigation as exemplary, and said Niall Long and Luke Taylor might never have been identified were it not for the huge volume of work on the case carried out by detectives. Both men indicated to the court through their counsel that they intend to appeal. Southern Editor © RTÉ 2025.

Title: The Evolution of Capitalism: Why Markets Defy Feudal Aristocracy

We rely on your support for our independence, diversity and quality. Via Shutterstock. This article saved into your bookmarks. Click here to view your bookmarks. In 2005, Citigroup analysts coined the term Plutonomy as an ideological provocation disguised as analysis. They argued that global growth rested disproportionately on the spending of the wealthy, especially the “top 1%.” According to this claim, the world economy follows the whims of the global elites’ demand, while the majority slips into irrelevance. The Plutonomy thesis reveals either ignorance of capitalism or ideological hostility toward it. Left-collectivist critics embrace it because it dresses capitalism as feudalism in modern clothes. But in essence, capitalism and feudalism are opposites. Feudalism chains wealth and power to the bloodline, preserving a static order. Capitalism breaks that order. It multiplies, redistributes and even annihilates wealth through innovation, entrepreneurship and competition. Plutonomy advocates point to inequality data to support their case. Yes, wealth concentration exists, but the inference those advocates draw from it is false. Capitalism’s logic is not one of privilege but freedom. Studies from Williams Group wealth consultancy show that two-thirds of wealthy families lose their fortune by the second generation, and 90% by the third. Concentration of wealth is not permanent but a phase in a cycle. The system does not malfunction when wealth clusters — it functions. Success receives reward, but failure swiftly destroys fortunes. The capitalist system rests on voluntary exchange, individual initiative and open competition. The moral principle is not “the few rule the many” but “each individual acts by right.” Critics mistake correlation for causation. Rising wealth at the top does not mean exclusion of the bottom. In fact, global data since 1980 demonstrates that while the top 1% grew richer, more than a billion people worldwide rose out of extreme poverty. China, India and much of Southeast Asia did not escape starvation because elites consumed more; they escaped because capitalism’s logic of production and trade reached their masses. The logic of capitalism undermines Plutonomy at its root. Elites may shape markets, but capitalism’s engine lies in mass participation. The wealthy do not dictate growth; they compete within a framework shaped by consumer sovereignty and entrepreneurial risk. No aristocracy ever built an industrial revolution; no plutocracy ever lifted billions from poverty. Only capitalism, driven by free exchange and broad demand, accomplished that. Capitalism treats wealth as a process, not a possession. Entrepreneurs must continually recreate wealth through production, innovation and risk-taking. Inherited fortunes erode when heirs fail to compete. Thomas Piketty claimed that capital tends to accumulate, but capitalist markets demonstrate the opposite: Unused capital dissipates. This competitive order forces every firm and every individual to justify their position anew. Aristocracy freezes history in bloodlines while capitalism accelerates history through challenge, destruction and renewal. Joseph Schumpeter identified this dynamic as creative destruction. He argued that capitalism thrives by overturning the old and replacing it with the new. Innosight data confirms this: In the 1950s, Fortune 500 companies survived on average for 60 years. Today, they survive for less than 20 years. Kodak dominated photography with 90% of the film market, yet it collapsed in 2012 because it ignored digital innovation. Canon, Sony and other firms seized Kodak’s market by betting on digital technologies. Nokia controlled 40% of the cellphone market in 1999, but its share fell below 5% by 2013 because it missed the smartphone revolution. Apple and Samsung seized Nokia’s throne. In 1980, oil and auto companies such as Exxon, GM and Ford dominated the global rankings. By 2022, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet and Tesla occupied those top positions. The World Economic Forum estimates that industries younger than 40 years generate over half of global GDP. Shifts in dominance reveal capitalism’s law: Innovators survive, complacent firms vanish. Entrepreneurial stories embody the same laws. American businessman Jeff Bezos launched Amazon in a garage in 1994 and expanded it into a trillion-dollar firm by leveraging capitalism’s infrastructure of financial markets and contract law. South African businessman Elon Musk reinvested profits from PayPal into Tesla and SpaceX, enterprises that toppled century-old automakers and state-run aerospace monopolies. American businessman Mark Zuckerberg built Facebook in a dormitory and redefined global communication. These entrepreneurs did not inherit aristocratic dynasties. They acted. Forbes reports that more than 70% of billionaires worldwide are self-made, and in China, over 80% built their fortunes as first-generation entrepreneurs. Capitalism rewards action, not birth. This dynamic reality delivers capitalism’s strongest refutation of aristocracy and Plutonomy. Aristocracy assumes permanence; capitalism enforces transience. Aristocracy passes property by bloodline; capitalism demands innovation by merit. Plutonomy imagines static classes; capitalism generates continual upheaval. In 19th-century American business life, the rise of the “inventor-businessman” type most clearly revealed capitalism’s difference from aristocracy. Andrew Carnegie, a poor immigrant from Scotland, rose to become one of the giants of the steel industry. John D. Rockefeller, starting from humble origins, founded Standard Oil and became the world’s first dollar billionaire. Rockefeller was born in 1839 in New York to a poor family. His father, William Avery Rockefeller, worked as a charlatan traveling salesman, always chasing ventures and failing to provide a steady income. His mother lived frugally and devotedly. Rockefeller grew up amidst poverty and uncertainty but absorbed discipline and thrift early on. At 16, he began working in an accounting firm. In his first years of work, he carefully tracked every dollar, saving some and donating some to charity. By his early twenties, he entered the oil business in Cleveland with his partners. At the time, oil was new and difficult to refine, yet Rockefeller turned these difficulties into advantages. Rockefeller founded Standard Oil in 1863 and quickly built it into the largest US oil company in refining, distribution and sales. He also tried to monopolize transportation by striking deals with railroad companies to gain cost advantages. This advantage lasted only until the state enacted antitrust laws. In 1911, the US Supreme Court declared Standard Oil a monopoly and ordered its breakup. Far from shrinking Rockefeller’s fortune, this ruling multiplied it, as the separated companies — Exxon, Chevron and Mobil — grew independently. The episode revealed a truth of the capitalist market: Even a monopoly, once broken, can generate more growth in a dynamic marketplace. Rockefeller also pioneered what we now call philanthropic capitalism. He donated hundreds of millions to institutions such as Harvard and the University of Chicago. The foundations he created in medicine and education still shape society today. He did not owe his wealth to the state, as state regulations tried to restrict him. He did not inherit aristocratic privilege, nor did he cling to feudal instincts of passing wealth intact to heirs. Instead, he taught his children thrift, philanthropy and entrepreneurship. Through his story, capitalism reveals its revolutionary and egalitarian nature: The son of a poor preacher left a permanent mark on world history through ability and hard work in the marketplace. The Rothschild family illustrates how intellect, numerical skill and entrepreneurship built a global banking network despite European antisemitism. Mayer Amschel Rothschild was born in 1744 in the Frankfurt ghetto, where Jews lived under restriction with scarce educational opportunities. Mayer displayed an extraordinary passion for books and numbers. As a youth, he apprenticed with a banker in Frankfurt, learning financial calculations. He then traded antiques and rare coins, building his first capital. This step gave him access to Frankfurt’s nobility. In the 1760s, Mayer achieved his breakthrough when he became financial advisor to Wilhelm IX, the Prince of Hesse-Kassel (a state within the Holy Roman Empire). He managed the prince’s wealth but showed greater genius by sending four of his five sons — Nathan Mayer, Saloman Mayer, Karl Mayer and James Mayer — to Europe’s capitals to establish a family banking network. Nathan went to London, Salomon to Vienna, Karl to Naples and James to Paris. The Rothschilds became the most influential financial family of 19th-century Europe. Their success came from superior knowledge, communication and risk management. Before the telegraph, they created networks that gave them faster access to market information. During the Napoleonic Wars, they controlled key information flows, lent money to Britain and helped finance the British army against France. The Rothschilds did not descend from a dynasty. They exemplified how a marginalized Jewish family could, despite prohibitions, become leaders in finance by investing in knowledge and commerce. The capitalist market valued their achievement, not their lineage. And although their descendants remain financially active, modern giants like BlackRock and Vanguard far surpass the influence the Rothschilds held a century ago. Their eclipse proves again that capitalism does not freeze into aristocracy but renews itself endlessly. Capitalism’s competitive nature creates a powerful resistance mechanism against the absolutization of economic power. Competition functions not as an external safeguard but as the system’s internal law, its self-regulating force. Those who claim that capitalists inevitably form cartels to seize markets misunderstand the essence of capitalism. Oligopolies may rise, and firms may dominate for a time, but such power cannot last. Knowledge flows, entrepreneurship pushes forward and innovation breaks every chain. The marketplace acts as a battlefield in which permanence is an illusion. What matters is the ability to adapt, not the possession of a temporary advantage. In the late 1980s, Microsoft commanded almost absolute dominance in global software with its Windows operating system and Office suite, which ran on over 80% of personal computers. Yet, this supremacy did not endure. Google rose by capturing the internet, Apple transformed communication through the iPhone and Linux opened doors for free software alternatives. Today, Microsoft remains powerful, yet it no longer controls the future of computing. The automobile industry reveals the same dynamic. For decades, General Motors, Ford and Chrysler ruled the US market. But Japanese firms —Toyota, Honda, Nissan — challenged them with efficient production and durable models. By the 1980s, Japanese automakers controlled nearly 30% of the US market, forcing Detroit into reform or collapse. In this century, Tesla has shattered the industry again, proving that even the giants of capitalism cannot insulate themselves from new rivals armed with better ideas. This fragility does not weaken capitalism; it strengthens it. Dynamism, not stagnation, defines its law. The rise of the East Asian Tigers — South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong — illustrates capitalism’s transformative power. In 1960, South Korea’s GDP per capita barely reached $150; by 2020, it had risen to over $30,000. Taiwan, once an agrarian economy, became a global technology leader and now produces more than 54% of the world’s semiconductors through Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). Singapore, a city-state without natural resources, climbed to rank among the wealthiest nations, with a GDP per capita surpassing $70,000. These countries escaped poverty not by state planning but by unleashing markets, encouraging exports, fostering education and creating an open environment for enterprise. Centrally planned economies show the opposite trajectory. The Soviet Union, despite immense resources, collapsed under inefficiency. Former supreme leader Mao Zedong’s China starved tens of millions. Only when Mao’s successor Deng Xiaoping’s reforms embraced markets in 1978 did China’s GDP begin to grow at an average of nearly 10% per year for three decades, lifting 800 million people out of extreme poverty. The real enemy of competition is not capitalism but the state. History shows that whenever governments step in to control markets, competition collapses. In the 17th century, the British Crown granted the East India Company exclusive rights to trade in Asia. Instead of innovation, this monopoly produced corruption, inefficiency and exploitation, until its collapse in the 19th century. In the 20th century, state-backed corporations in Latin America — such as Pemex in Mexico or Petrobras in Brazil — became centers of inefficiency and political patronage, draining resources without innovation. The United States itself has suffered similar distortions: The government’s antitrust case against AT&T in the 1980s reveals how state-protected dominance stalled telecommunications innovation. Once AT&T was broken up, competition flourished, giving rise to mobile telephony, the internet and the digital revolution. In the second half of the 20th century, South Korea and Taiwan embraced export-led capitalism, transforming from impoverished to high-income economies. Between 1960 and 1990, South Korea’s GDP per capita grew nearly tenfold. By contrast, North Korea, under state control, stagnated in famine and isolation. The same divide appeared in Germany: West Germany’s market economy surged after 1948, while East Germany’s socialist experiment collapsed under inefficiency and repression. Latin America shows the same truth. Venezuela — with the world’s largest proven oil reserves — nationalized industries and imposed state control. By 2020, its GDP had contracted by over 70% from the previous decade, inflation exceeded one million percent and millions fled the country in response to the economic crisis. Meanwhile, Chile liberalized markets in the 1970s and 80s. From 1990 to 2015, its poverty rate fell from 40% to under 10%, and it became Latin America’s richest nation per capita. In China, state-owned enterprises (SOEs) consume over 30% of the country’s bank credit yet generate less than 10% of GDP growth. World Bank data shows SOEs earn returns on assets less than half those of private firms. They survive on subsidies, cheap credit and political protection. By contrast, private firms — Huawei, Tencent, Alibaba and BYD — compete globally and drive breakthroughs in telecom, digital finance and electric vehicles. The difference lies in rules: SOEs live by privilege, private firms by competition. SOEs employ barely 10% of China’s workforce yet capture most corporate credit, starving small firms of capital. Productivity lags because connected giants hoard resources. Meanwhile, the private sector — responsible for 80% of urban jobs and 70% of innovation — faces crackdowns whenever it threatens state power. The West tells the story in another form. The 2008 financial crisis showed how intervention entrenches failure. US and European governments bailed out American International Group (AIG), Citigroup, Royal Bank of Scotland and others, freezing competition and rewarding recklessness. The US Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) spent $700 billion rescuing failing banks, while the Eurozone added trillions in guarantees. Instead of disciplining error, states preserved it. These bailouts created a sense of moral hazard. Banks knew governments would shield them, so accountability vanished. A decade of ultra-low rates followed, keeping “zombie companies” alive. This was not a result of capitalism failing, but capitalism blocked. The corrective force of failure capitalism provides, was replaced by political privilege. Russian-American writer and philosopher Ayn Rand foresaw it: “The difference between a welfare state and a totalitarian state is only a matter of time.” When governments protect the incompetent, they turn markets from arenas of merit into shelters of privilege. The market demands discipline. Remove that truth, and freedom vanishes. State-backed oligopolies, rent-seeking firms and politically privileged corporations represent the intrusion of non-capitalist elements into the system. Rand captured this with brutal clarity in her novel Atlas Shrugged: When you see that trading is done, not by consent, but by compulsion — when you see that in order to produce, you need permission from men who produce nothing — when you see that money is flowing to those who deal, not in goods, but in favors … you may know that your society is doomed. Her warning underscores the point: government favoritism replaces merit with power and enterprise with privilege. A genuine free market grants no actor permanent advantage. Every success must be tested, every fortune re-earned, every firm challenged. Collectivist regimes historically reveal the true nature of plutonomy. The Soviet Union gave Politburo elites privileges comparable to those of Western billionaires, while ordinary people could not access basic goods. In China, Mao’s Cultural Revolution impoverished millions, while Party cadres enjoyed privileged lives. During Deng’s reforms, the state integrated market elements but ensured that real capital accumulation still depended on Party ties. In contemporary China, the case of business magnate and investor Jack Ma illustrates this reality: after criticizing government policies, he lost public visibility, and the state restructured Alibaba (a multinational technology company), demonstrating how easily political authority can dismantle market success. The case of Venezuela illustrates the modern socialist version of plutonomy. Former Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez built his 21st-century socialism not by distributing oil revenues to the people but by concentrating them within the state apparatus and a loyal elite. Managers of Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) enriched themselves rapidly in foreign currency, while the general population lacked access to basic food and medicine. These cases prove that plutonomy emerges not in capitalism but in collectivism. Capitalism’s stability and sustainability depend on a broad consumer base that responds to production. Economic growth and prosperity come not from the excessive wealth of the minority but from the consumption capacity of the majority. The capitalist market functions as a democratic decision-making arena. Consumers, through their daily purchasing choices, effectively cast votes in the marketplace. These votes reflect not only economic value but also preference. The market thus becomes a ballot box where products and services, not rulers, compete. Consumer behavior directly shapes economic existence. The consumer acts as capitalism’s “silent voter” — silent because the vote is cast by buying, not speaking. Yet this silence masks immense power: the collective choices of consumers decide whether a product stays on shelves, spreads or vanishes. Unlike centrally planned systems, capitalism rests on pluralism and bottom-up consent. Liberal democratic philosophy aligns with this capitalist structure. Just as political leaders rise through popular votes, entrepreneurs and producers survive only through consumer choice. No matter their capital, ventures without customers collapse. This reality highlights capitalism’s populist and majoritarian nature, not an aristocratic one. Capitalism is no elitist club but a competitive arena built on mass consent. For a product to remain in the market, it must resonate with the public. This constant need for validation keeps capitalism open to pressures from below. Broad participation is the indispensable condition of capitalist democracy. If middle- and lower-income groups cannot participate, the voting mechanism breaks down. Capitalism requires individuals not just to exist as consumers but to function effectively as consumers. The democratic nature of the market creates fairness and dynamism. Consumer choice directs supply, drives innovation, raises efficiency and prevents waste. Each purchase acts as a “yes” vote; each rejection, a “no” vote. This continuous micro-level voting process builds a coordination mechanism more precise and dynamic than any central planner could achieve. The market generates a natural order through supply and demand. Austrian-British economist and philosopher Friedrich Hayek described this as spontaneous order, where knowledge spreads through millions of free decisions, not through central authority. No ministry or planning agency can collect and process such knowledge. French diplomat, political philosopher and historian Alexis de Tocqueville highlights a fundamental tension in Democracy in America: In democratic societies, when freedom is sacrificed to equality, people become passive and consent to their own chains. The plutonomy discourse offers exactly such chains: it promises not freedom but passivity under the guise of equality. Capitalism rests on the moral principle of consent. Neither producer nor consumer, neither employer nor employee, enters the system by force. This order, built on mutual benefit, secures not only economic efficiency but also individual autonomy. Capitalist economics allow the individual to secure their place through labor, capital or ideas. In contrast, plutonomy undermines freedom by persuading individuals to believe in systemic determinism rather than their own potential. This mentality denies individual worth and responsibility, portraying success not as the product of productivity but as a matter of birth privilege. As a result, young individuals turn away from entrepreneurship, and potential inventors give way to “pseudo-opponents” who hate the system yet make no contribution.

Title: Will Ethereum Outperform Bitcoin In 2026?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/29/will-ethereum-outperform-bitcoin-in-2026/
Time Published: 2025-10-29T13:14:08Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Ethereum’s impressive 120% rise over the past six months, reaching approximately $4,000, has significantly eclipsed Bitcoin’s modest 20% increase during this timeframe. This isn’t merely a fleeting moment—various fundamental factors indicate that ETH might sustain its outperformance trajectory.​ Before we explore the specifics, if you’re interested in an upside with less volatility compared to holding a single stock or token like ETH or BTC, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has thoroughly outperformed its benchmark—a mix of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indices—and has secured returns surpassing 105% since its inception. Why is this the case? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster experience, as seen in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Investing in a single stock or token without thorough analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices), delivering robust returns for investors. Why is this the situation? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks has offered a responsive approach to maximize gains during optimistic market conditions while minimizing losses when markets decline, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics. Ethereum’s superior performance indicates genuine fundamental advantages: the adoption of institutional ETFs, upcoming technical enhancements, deflationary tokenomics, and its foundational role in the expanding DeFi ecosystem. The December Fusaka upgrade and ongoing institutional accumulation imply that this trend might continue well into 2026.​ Nevertheless, investors need to balance ETH’s higher reward potential with its elevated volatility and technical complexity.

And it didn’t pick Ethereum or Bitcoin. 📌 What Happened Western Union, the 173-year-old global money transfer giant, just announced it’s launching a stablecoin on Solana. Western Union will issue a U.S. dollar stablecoin called USDPT, built on Solana, with custody provided by Anchorage Digital. The rollout begins in 2026, targeting hundreds of millions of users across LatAm, Africa, and Southeast Asia, regions where stablecoins already dominate real economic usage. The stablecoin will plug straight into Western Union’s existing licensed fiat rails and 4,500+ corridors, enabling people to move dollars across borders without banks, ACH delays, or predatory FX fees. And here’s the curveball: Western Union says it plans to keep supporting cash-in and cash-out locations, effectively becoming a global on/off ramp for Solana. 🗣️ What They’re Saying “For 175 years, we’ve been connecting people, moving $150 billion a year. Digital assets is the next evolution. We looked at alternatives, and came to the conclusion that Solana was the right choice.” - Devin McGranahan, CEO of Western Union Why is Western Union launching a stablecoin on Solana? > Here's what Devin McGranahan, CEO of Western Union, said 👇 "For 175 years, we've been connecting people, moving $150 billion a year.

This is massive for both Solana and stablecoins. Solana just got validation from a major payments player on a global scale. Payments is crypto’s biggest real-world use case today, and Solana now anchors the largest remittance migration play in history. As for stablecoins, the are clearly eating the world, and Western Union is capitulating in. Global remittances are a $860 billion market. If even 10% of those flows move to stablecoins over the next two years, that’s $86 billion in annual on-chain volume. Largely on Solana. Stablecoins are the future - and Solana is a part of that future. A really nice narrative win, on the same day that Bitwise’s Solana ETF set the record for highest volume for any new ETF launch in 2025.

UPDATED 08:00 EDT / OCTOBER 29 2025 by Duncan Riley Cybersecurity and data protection company Acronis International GmbH today announced the launch of Acronis Cyber Protect Local, a new solution that delivers natively integrated cyber resilience for on-premises, sovereign private cloud, and air-gapped information technology and operational technology environments. Cyber Protect Local is designed for organizations where cloud deployment is not an option and combines backup, recovery, cybersecurity and endpoint management in a single platform. The service delivers agile, resilient and compliant IT and OT operations while reducing costs and operational complexity. The new offering keeps data securely within the customer’s perimeter to ensure full data sovereignty and regulatory compliance, the company says. It supports legacy systems and modern hypervisors, including Windows XP, OT/ICS environments, Nutanix, Proxmox, VMware and Hyper-V, to ensure complete coverage across mixed infrastructures. Acronis says customers benefit from strong backward compatibility, one-click self-service recovery and expanded workload portability for virtual and hyperconverged environments. Acronis Cyber Protect offers natively integrated endpoint security and management and automated discovery of unmanaged devices via Acronis Device Sense that help reduce tooling complexity while enhancing operational efficiency. Physical-to-virtual, virtual-to-virtual and cross-platform recovery are simplified, with no need for separate agent installations to allow organizations to migrate workloads seamlessly while maintaining protection. Key features include unified cyber resilience, with support for backups, recovery, cybersecurity and endpoint management in a single agent and single console. There’s also data sovereignty, with management and data kept within a customer perimeter to ensure compliance, as well as comprehensive workload support, artificial intelligence-driven automation and cross-platform agility. “The systems that ensure we have access to water, electricity, technology, healthcare and transportation are vulnerable targets for cyberattacks due to their reliance on outdated software and hardware,” said President Gaidar Magdanurov. “Acronis Cyber Protect Local brings the power and innovation of our trusted cloud cyber protection platform directly on-premises, running on a dedicated management server within the customer’s internal networks to meet strict security and data location requirements.” Based in Switzerland, Acronis is a venture capital-backed startup that has raised $658 million over four rounds, including rounds of $147 million in 2019 and $250 million on a valuation north of $2.5 billion in 2021. Investors in the company include BlackRock Inc., CVC Capital Partners Ltd., Goldman Sachs Investment Partners and Insight Partners LP. In August 2024, it was announced that Swedish investment firm EQT was acquiring a majority stake in Acronis. Support our mission to keep content open and free by engaging with theCUBE community.

Title: Trump Mulls Replacing Jerome Powell As Fed Chair As Shortlist Narrows

Time Published: 2025-10-29T10:30:39Z
Full Content:
US President Donald Trump has announced plans to remove Jerome Powell as head of the Federal Reserve, citing incompetence. Amid the plot to remove Powell, there is a five-horse race for potential replacements for the current Fed Chair as Trump’s top choice declines the offer. US President Donald Trump has fired a new round of criticisms at Jerome Powell over his handling of the Federal Reserve, hinting at an imminent replacement. According to a report, Trump noted that plans are underway to name a new Fed Chair before the end of the year. Trump disclosed the plans during a dinner for business leaders in Tokyo as part of his week-long trip to Asia. The US President has previously railed against Powell over his refusal to cut interest rates, with the Federal Reserve headquarters fiasco fuelling more criticisms. “We have an incompetent head of the Fed. We got a bad Fed guy, but he’ll be out of there in a few months, and we will get somebody new,” said Trump. Powell’s term as Fed Chair is expected to come to an end in May 2026, bringing an end to a nearly eight-year tenure at the helm of affairs. Early in the week, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent revealed that the administration is considering five potential replacements for Powell. At the moment, the five finalists include White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett, BlackRock executive Rick Rieder, Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, and current Fed Governor Christopher Waller. Bessent noted that he will do one more round of interviews on the five finalists before formally submitting their names to the White House after the Thanksgiving holiday. Meanwhile, Trump had previously tapped Bessent to replace Powell, but the Treasury Secretary declined to serve as Federal Reserve chair. “I’m thinking about him for the Fed, but he won’t take the job,” said Trump on Bessent’s refusal. “He likes being Treasury Secretary, so we’re not thinking about him really.” Despite Powell’s previous reluctance to cut interest rates, cryptocurrency markets are pricing in a rate cut in October’s FOMC meeting. Data from the FedWatch CME tool pegs the probability for a rate cut to 375-400 bps at 99.9%, potentially representing back-to-back cuts after September’s easing. At the moment, Bitcoin is trading at $113,096, while Ethereum is holding the $4,000 psychological price point. However, investors are eyeing a bullish upswing following forecasted rate cuts that are expected to push the global cryptocurrency market capitalization above $4 trillion.

Title: Top AIG Exec Has Major Fossil Fuel Ties

Time Published: 2025-10-29T09:00:00Z

This article is published in partnership with the Center for Media and Democracy. At the end of July, a group of residents of Brownsville, Texas, gathered to discuss the risk of explosions from a new methane export facility—Rio Grande LNG—that is being built right next to a SpaceX rocket facility with a history of explosions. Their fear? That their communities risk being blown up due to ongoing accidents in both sectors. Indeed, just the month before, an enormous explosion rocked the SpaceX facility in Brownsville. “They’re attacking us. They’re killing us,” a resident told Telemundo, referring to the extraordinary fossil fuel infrastructure expansion in the border city. More from Matthew Cunningham-Cook Rio Grande LNG is one of the most expansive methane build-outs in the country, with the project set to cost $18 billion and handle a capacity of 17.6 million tons per year of liquefied natural gas, which would make it the second-largest methane export facility in the U.S. Its largest ownership stake is held by NextDecade, a publicly traded fossil fuel firm, but it is also backed by Global Infrastructure Partners, a private equity subsidiary of BlackRock, and TotalEnergies, a major French oil and gas firm. Construction has continued despite the project being in ongoing legal limbo, with the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals blocking its regulatory approvals last year. Despite the challenges of explosions, legal uncertainty, and the ongoing climate crisis, American International Group (AIG) is insuring Rio Grande LNG. This insurance arrangement comes as a Center for Media and Democracy (CMD) investigation shows that John G. Rice, AIG’s lead independent director, holds the exact same position at Baker Hughes, a global fossil fuel technology company that has received major contracts from both Rio Grande LNG and Calcasieu Pass LNG, which is also insured by AIG. AIG is one of the top ten insurers of fossil fuel companies in the country, and a report by Insure Our Future, a climate advocacy group, found that it collects over $500 million annually in premiums from insuring the fossil fuel industry and held $27.4 billion in fossil fuel investments as of 2022. In addition to the Rio Grande project and Calcasieu Pass LNG Phase 1 (owned by Venture Global), AIG is also insuring Cameron LNG (majority-owned by Sempra and backed by KKR, Mitsubishi, and TotalEnergies) on the Gulf Coast of Louisiana, along with historically insuring the Gulf LNG and Freeport LNG projects. The relationship between AIG and Baker Hughes has not been publicly disclosed prior to this. In its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), AIG does not disclose that the projects it is insuring give major contracts to Baker Hughes despite the fact that the relationships could be material and, as a result, compromise federal standards on director independence. AIG has only disclosed that Rice is a director at Baker Hughes, not that he is its lead independent director, which is the second-most powerful position in a company when the CEO is also the chairman of the firm, as is the case with both Baker Hughes and AIG. Yaron Nili, a professor at Duke University School of Law who has studied director independence issues, told CMD that AIG’s failure to disclose that Rice is the lead independent director as opposed to an ordinary director at Baker Hughes could be considered “problematic,” and added that there is a “requirement [by AIG] to disclose anything that materially would impact their independence.” “These industries are so intertwined, as evidenced by Rice having these dual roles,” Rick Morris, an insurance campaigner at Public Citizen, told CMD. “They’re sacrificing our ability to get property insurance … in order to continue to make short-term profits off of the very causes of climate change.” The Gulf Coast is one of the most burdened regions on the planet when it comes to fossil fuels, with 20 new or expanded export facilities currently being proposed or under construction. There are now eight functioning LNG export facilities in the U.S., but if all the proposed projects get built nationwide, that number will balloon to 31. Liquefied natural gas is mostly methane, which is 28 times more effective than CO2 at trapping heat in the atmosphere, and currently accounts for 11 percent of global emissions. In 2022, a “Banking on Climate Chaos” report estimated that if the 18 proposed new fossil fuel export facilities on the Gulf were completed, they would generate 1.5 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions per year, equivalent to emissions from 320 million cars. With the growth of fracking and export infrastructure on the Gulf Coast—along with a monumental increase in demand from Europe in the aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022—natural gas exports have expanded rapidly, with a tripling of U.S. exports between 2019 and 2024. Subscribe for analysis that goes beyond the noise. In January 2024, the Biden administration put a pause on new LNG export approvals, citing environmental and energy security concerns. A federal judge in Louisiana then blocked that pause in June of last year, but in January of this year President Trump ordered it to be lifted on the first day he returned to office. Just before the presidential transition (in December 2024), Biden’s Energy Department also released a report warning that unfettered LNG exports could drive up prices for U.S. consumers and worsen the impacts of climate change. Trump, who campaigned on the promise to “drill, baby, drill” and push American dominance in dirty energy, has firmly rejected that approach. Instead, his administration has fast-tracked new LNG export infrastructure, allowing these exports to hit record highs as the president has tied access to U.S. markets to foreign purchases of American LNG. In the first quarter of 2025, AIG posted $460 million worth of losses from the fires in Los Angeles, which were exacerbated by climate change. Insure Our Future, which advocates for insurance industry accountability in climate change, estimated in December 2024 that $600 billion in property and casualty losses globally were due to climate change–related issues, which accounted for 38 percent of total losses in the sector. “AIG is one of the largest insurers of methane export terminals on the Gulf Coast,” Ethan Nuss, an organizing strategist at the Rainforest Action Network, told CMD. He cited a major disaster in August during dredging as part of the massive new Calcasieu Pass terminal, which will be one of the largest in the world. “There was a huge overflow of dredging sediment into public waterways and fishing grounds of the local fishing communities who have fished those waters for generations,” Nuss explained. Nuss pointed out that AIG generally seems to turn a blind eye to risks when insuring the methane build-out. At one point, the company insured Freeport LNG in Freeport, Texas (also on the Gulf Coast), which experienced a major combustion event in June 2022 that “sent flames shooting 450 feet into the air, injuring beachgoers, shaking residents’ homes and sending tons of toxic chemicals into the air,” according to Melanie Oldham, a Freeport resident, in a 2023 press release. “To this day the community has not received basic safety guarantees from the company that the problems that led to that explosion have been resolved,” Nuss said. In response to investor pressure, AIG released what it calls a “climate roadmap” last year. Yet Nuss says that the firm has continued to prioritize its relationships with the fossil fuel industry. “AIG says that they care about climate and are in the process of developing a climate action plan, but they are actively insuring and backing this very industry that we know is incompatible with a livable climate,” he said. Rice’s role at Baker Hughes shows that there is a “very clear relationship between AIG at a corporate level and their stake in the methane industry. The stakes couldn’t be [higher], not only for those … who live next to these dangerous terminals, with the risk of explosions and loss of livelihood and threats to their health. There’s also the threat to [our] shared climate. We know that if we have any hope of a livable climate we cannot afford to build new methane terminals, full stop,” Nuss said, citing research from the International Energy Agency to buttress his concerns about insurers’ complicity in exacerbating the crisis. Morris of Public Citizen draws a line between AIG’s continued underwriting of fossil fuel projects amid the escalating climate crisis to its role in the 2008 financial crisis, when the company insured complex financial products that detonated the global economy, requiring a $182 billion bailout from the U.S. government. The firm’s share price has never meaningfully recovered in the 17 years since that crisis. “In 2008, the [world] faced a financial crash caused by speculative activities by companies like AIG,” Morris noted. “Those investments caused a crisis in the housing market [that] trickled down to affect every American and just about every country on the globe. [Now] AIG continues to play fast and loose with the U.S. housing market [through] their investments in fossil fuels, spiking the rates that Americans pay for their home insurance. When people cannot afford home insurance … they cannot get a mortgage to buy a home, period. When you look at AIG’s central role in the 2008 financial crisis it is difficult not to draw stark parallels to the crisis we face today.” Morris underscored the critical role insurers play in the fossil fuel infrastructure expansion, noting that “you can’t find investors for a fossil fuel project if that project is not insured first.” AIG—and the insurance industry as a whole—“is bent on squeezing every last cent out of the American people while abandoning them at the very time that they need to rely on their insurance.” In a statement, Baker Hughes told CMD that the company “is committed to ethical business practices, transparency, and full compliance with all applicable disclosure obligations”—yet it failed to make its general counsel available for an interview.

Title: Circle debuts public testnet of its payment-focused Arc chain – Details

Will the incoming payment chains shake Ethereum’s stablecoin market share? If the test is successful, the payment-focused chain could soon hit the public mainnet for everyone. It signals incoming shifts across the stablecoin payment ecosystem, and whether Ethereum will hold its ground remains to be seen. Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, is close to launching its Arc chain – A global payment-focused L1 powered by digital dollars. In a statement on 28 October, the firm said that it had begun public testing for the chain alongside key design partners. The partners include top banks, insurers, and asset managers like BlackRock, HSBC, and Absa, among others. According to Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire, the partners have billions of users and handle trillions of dollars in assets across the globe. He claimed that Arc can seamlessly allow local markets and builders to connect to the global economy. Allaire called it the “economic OS of the internet,” and added, “This geographic diversity highlights a defining strength of Arc: its purpose-built to connect every local market to the global economy.” Source: X Beyond global and agentic payments, Arc also aims to support on-chain FX (foreign exchange) and capital markets (tokenization). In fact, BlackRock’s Global Head of Digital Assets, Robert Mitchnick, underscored FX and tokenization as key interests for them in the project. He said, “Exploring Arc will provide insight into how stablecoin-denominated settlement and onchain FX capabilities might enable more efficient capital markets and unlock additional utility for onchain assets.” Arc is not the only purpose-built project seeking to rewrite payment and capital markets via on-chain rails though. Google, Stripe, and Tether have similar plans. In fact, Tether-backed Plasma [XPL] is already live and handles about $6 billion of the stablecoin supply. It’s now the fifth-largest chain for digital dollars. Source: DeFiLlama Google’s GUCL and Stripe’s Tempo are expected to launch in the near future. Collectively, the new chains could challenge Ethereum’s market share in stablecoin settlement, according to some analysts. Out of the current $305 billion in total stablecoin supply, Ethereum controls $162 billion or 53%. Tron [TRX] handles about a quarter of the overall market, while the rest is shared among other chains. However, in terms of stablecoin transfers, Ethereum’s volumes have been making record figures every month. In fact, for the first time, the stablecoin volume crossed the $2 trillion milestone on Ethereum this October. Source: The Block Even so, it remains to be seen whether Arc, Plasma, Tempo, or Google’s payment chains will grab Ethereum’s market share.

Title: Saudi Arabia could become an AI focal point

SUBSCRIBE & SAVE Less than $3 per week A state-backed AI21 project hopes to rival China and the United States China and the United States are widely seen as the top two countries making artificial intelligence advancements, but there’s another nation looking to get in the game: Saudi Arabia. The wealth of Saudi businessmen is attracting outside investors to the Gulf kingdom as it tries to entice American tech companies to expand AI operations. But many are skeptical of what Saudi Arabia’s AI push could mean for the tech world and beyond. The nation wants to expand its tech influence by using AI, as “few nations can match the kingdom’s cheap energy, deep pockets and open land,” said The New York Times. All of these things are “ingredients that tech firms need to operate the vast, power-hungry data centers that run modern AI.” The kingdom’s de facto leader, Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, is “seizing a chance to turn Saudi Arabia’s oil wealth into tech influence.” Saudi officials have been trying to woo American tech companies to the desert, with “executives from OpenAI, Google, Qualcomm, Intel and Oracle” all set to meet at an upcoming Middle Eastern investment summit, said the Times. Many of these executives “will be keen to seek out the opportunities that change tends to bring,” said Bloomberg, and will look to “divine the kingdom’s plans for the more than $200 billion it earns each year from oil exports.” The country is additionally building several AI data centers that may further entice U.S. brands.

Riyadh is also looking to strengthen its own AI development through Humain, a state-owned AI company backed by the Saudi sovereign wealth fund. The company believes it can eventually be the “third-largest AI provider in the world, behind the United States and China,” Humain CEO Tareq Amin said to CNBC. Humain is looking toward U.S. moguls in an effort to boost itself; Blackstone and BlackRock, two of the largest investment companies on Wall Street, are “already vying to invest billions of dollars with the firm,” said Bloomberg. Saudi Arabia is well on its way to building this AI groundwork, as Humain “offers AI services and products, including data centers, AI infrastructure, cloud capabilities and advanced AI models,” and is also developing a computer operating system that “enables users to speak to a computer to tell it to perform tasks,” said Reuters. But not everyone is happy about Saudi Arabia’s rapid development of AI, largely due to the country’s various human rights abuse allegations and treatment of women. Other experts don’t believe the hype around Saudi tech. Saudi Arabia has a notably “shallow pool of AI expertise,” and many “warn of a global glut in computing capacity as governments and companies race to build data centers faster than they can profit from them,” said the Times. Crown Prince bin Salman has said that Humain’s goal is to handle 6% of the global AI workload — but this could be a stretch. Tech experts “can never say never,” John Dinsdale, a senior analyst for Synergy, said to the Times. “But I can’t imagine any circumstances that would enable Saudi Arabia to achieve 6% of the world’s AI compute capacity.” A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Justin Klawans has worked as a staff writer at The Week since 2022.

Germany’s dramatic economic collapse is dragging its geopolitical standing down with it. Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul has now learned what it means to be treated as a second-tier diplomat, receiving the red card from Beijing. A humiliation and a reprimand for Germany. The school of life can be cruel. Growing up usually means losing lofty ideals, fringe ideologies and the dreamy mindset of an inexperienced existence to the harsh reality of the world. Reality follows its own rules, unimpressed by self-delusion. That moment of maturity, the exit from the bubble of hermetically-sealed party ideology, has now arrived for Germany’s top diplomat. A Minister of Fantasies Johann Wadephul, who only recently wandered through wonderland attributing the German economic miracle to Turkish immigrants, had to cancel his first official visit to China at the last minute because Beijing saw no need to speak with a German delegation. The Christian Democrat is learning, much like his BlackRock-seasoned party colleague Friedrich Merz, that Germany’s dramatic economic decline is being followed instantly by a loss of geopolitical relevance. Wadephul’s first China trip was intended as a reset in the strained diplomatic relationship with Beijing. A high-profile business delegation was set to accompany him and help ease tensions over critical rare earth supplies. China has been threatening a complete export ban for weeks, a measure that would instantly paralyze key German industries. Suddenly Business Matters The delegation was to include representatives from the German automotive industry, Siemens Healthineers, the German Robotics Association and a leading importer of rare earth elements. Together, they were meant to relieve pressure in Beijing and secure access to the essential resources that Germany’s industrial base cannot function without. When Beijing made clear that it would not entertain additional talks beyond the mandatory meeting of foreign ministers, Wadephul was forced to cancel the trip late Friday. A last-ditch attempt to save face and limit the political damage. Perhaps Wadephul should have copied his predecessor Annalena Baerbock and focused on moral-philosophical escapism such as feminist foreign policy. It is harmless, fits the German zeitgeist, and would have earned him brownie points among left-leaning coalition partners. The Giant’s Achilles Heel Right now, Europe would desperately need a delegation that positions itself smartly in the slipstream of the Americans. Every giant has a weakness. China’s economy is caught in a self-reinforcing deflationary spiral triggered by draconian U.S. tariffs and a long-festering property crisis caused by massive state-driven capital misallocation. Deflation is fatal because China’s growth relies on the fiat-credit machine. Rising insolvencies mean shrinking loan books. The credit turbo sputters, collateral values collapse through fire sales and oversupply, especially in real estate. Then the state must intervene again, inject more government credit and weaken its currency further. It is a vicious cycle gripping nearly every modern economy. China’s answer has always been the same: a colossal export-subsidy engine, a mercantilist model built at the expense of trade partners who lost production capacity to China. Beijing’s trade surplus accounts for roughly 1 percent of global GDP. Roughly 1 trillion U.S. dollars, fueled by massive export aid. On top of that come geopolitical Trojan horses like the Belt and Road Initiative, opening markets wherever China needs raw materials. China Is Desperate for Replacement Markets Europe’s internal market has become essential for Beijing to dump excess production. The U.S. market is increasingly blocked since Donald Trump’s tariff offensive: Chinese exports to the United States have crashed by a staggering 27 percent. At the same time, Chinese exports to Germany rose 10.7 percent in the first half of the year. To prevent a labor-market meltdown at home, Beijing is flooding alternative markets with overcapacity. The Communist Party is facing a youth unemployment rate likely around 20 percent. The social explosive lies right there. This is precisely where Europe -- especially Berlin -- could apply leverage. In the escalating struggle for rare earth access, crucial for German industry and especially automakers, Europe could build real bargaining power by teaming up with the United States. Irresponsible and Stubborn It is irresponsible, considering China’s 90-percent dominance in rare-earth refining, not to side with Washington and secure strategic advantages for Europe’s own industrial survival. Ideologically rigid, strategically naive and severely weakened by its trade debacles with the U.S., EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is stumbling from one pseudo-summit to the next like a dethroned Brussels queen. One gets the impression that the entire climate circus, the theatrical solidarity on Ukraine and the delusional green posture have become a psychological overcompensation for the visible failure of the Brussels project. Time to Seek Alliance with the United States Europe should have embraced geopolitical division of labor with Washington from the start. Especially now that the U.S., under a hyperactive foreign-policy president, is openly claiming leadership. Trump is right to point at EU protectionism, ubiquitous climate regulation and a policy increasingly hostile to markets. Washington is on the offensive: deregulation, tax cuts, junking the quasi-religious climate cult. It’s working: the U.S. economy is growing 3.8 percent, new debt fell from 6.7 to 5.8 percent. Trump is recalibrating the system while Europe tumbles in the opposite direction: higher debt, deeper recession. Wadephul and his fellow European diplomats must finally accept this reality and drop their escalating crusade over censorship laws, scrap the Digital Services Act, the Digital Markets Act and the online-surveillance regime entirely. Instead, they should seek fair trade with the U.S. without hidden climate protectionism. Europe is resource-poor and energy-dependent, importing up to 60 percent of its energy. Without Russian energy and raw materials, Europe’s prosperity model collapses. And the attack on a Eurasian rapprochement between continental Europe and resource-rich Russia did not come from Washington, despite media mantras to the contrary. It came straight from the heart of the European Union. Image: AT via Magic Studio Germany’s dramatic economic collapse is dragging its geopolitical standing down with it.

by Pivot 5G AI BROADBAND NATION CYBERSECURITY FIBER BROADBAND FIXED WIRELESS M&A MARKET RESEARCH MOBILE POLICY RURAL BROADBAND VIDEO Verizon’s announcement this week about the company’s commercial agreement with Eaton Fiber is the latest example of how important the “killer bundle” of mobile and internet service has become. Or, as Verizon put it in the press release, the goal is to “accelerate Verizon’s broadband and mobility convergence strategy.” Customers who buy both mobile and internet from the same provider generate higher average revenue and are less likely to churn in comparison with customers who only buy a single service. While mobile service is widely available nationwide from AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon, no provider has a nationwide broadband footprint. But all three providers are expanding where they offer broadband. Verizon’s plan to purchase Frontier will expand the company’s reach to 31 states and the District of Columbia. The agreement with Eaton Fiber, an affiliate of Tillman Global Holdings, will target markets outside of Verizon’s and Frontier’s current fiber-to-the-home footprint. According to the press release, Eaton Fiber will “fund and build the network and be responsible for network maintenance and installation.” Verizon’s responsibilities will include sales, marketing, and end-user customer service. The wording of the release suggests that other providers also will be able to use the network, but Verizon will have a head start. “Verizon will be the exclusive retail provider of residential fiber services over the new network through the build phase and for an additional time period, ensuring competitive advantage in subscriber acquisition,” the release states. AT&T also has been making fiber deals targeting areas outside its broadband footprint. The company also has a joint venture with BlackRock to expand its fiber reach. Although T-Mobile has had tremendous success with its fixed wireless offering, the company lacks the expansive fiber footprints that AT&T and Verizon already have. Unsurprisingly, the company’s fiber strategy, in large part, has been to acquire fiber assets that are already in the ground, through joint ventures to acquire Lumos and Metronet. In addition, T-Mobile has its own deal with Tillman Fiber. Telecompetitor is a publication of Pivot.

Title: Panama Canal Opens Search for Partners in $2.6B Dual-Terminal Project
URL: https://sourcingjournal.com/topics/logistics/panama-canal-authority-partners-dual-terminal-operators-consultation-construction-project-ports-corozal-telfers-1234786645/
Time Published: 2025-10-28T21:50:07Z

By Glenn Taylor As the Panama Canal’s operator turns its focus to developing new port terminals on both sides of the trade conduit, it has launched a “consultation process” designed to identify possible partners that would control the gateways. The Panama Canal Authority (ACP) made the announcement Monday after holding an invite-only meeting including members of both major container shipping lines and global port and terminal operators. In August, the ACP indicated it planned to sell rights to two plots of land reserved for the construction of two new ports near the canal. These two ports would be individual transshipment terminals—Corozal on the Pacific Ocean and Telfers serving the Atlantic Ocean. Combined, the two terminals are expected to boost the country’s overall container-handling capacity from 9.5 million 20-foot equivalent units (TEUs) to 15 million TEUs annually. The construction of the terminals is expected to cost $2.6 billion, with both scheduled to begin operations in 2029 upon completion. As part of the process, the authority will conduct a market and feasibility study for both terminals. Following this stage, a general project plan will be developed which will lead to the initiation of a special process to select a concessionaire for each terminal. Related Stories Topics Ocean Freight Rates Bounce Back as Carriers Tighten Capacity, But Will it Last? Topics Cosco, OOCL Rack Up $43M in Port Fees in First Week After USTR Penalties Take Effect The selection will include a pre-qualification phase, a one-on-one dialogue stage with pre-qualified participants, and finally, the awarding of the concession contracts. The final phase of the selection is expected to conclude in the fourth quarter of 2026. Approximately 8,100 direct and indirect jobs are expected to be generated during construction, the ACP says, with that number jumping to 9,000 once operations begin. The project is forecast to provide an economic impact of between 0.4 percent and 0.8 percent of Panama’s gross domestic product (GDP). Representatives from terminal operators included Maersk-owned APM Terminals, Cosco Shipping Ports, CMA Terminals, DP World, Port Houston, PSA International and Mediterranean Shipping Company’s (MSC) Terminal Investment Limited. The ocean carriers consisted of CMA CGM, Cosco Shipping, Evergreen, Hapag Lloyd, Hyundai Merchant Marine (HMM), Maersk, MSC, Ocean Network Express (ONE), Orient Overseas Container Line (OOCL), Yang Ming and ZIM. “We think that if it isn’t done here in Panama, it will happen elsewhere in the region, and we have to decide whether we want to stay competitive,” said Víctor Vial, vice president of finance at the ACP, at the Monday press conference. For the ACP, and for Panama in general, the desire to foster more competition at the canal comes as geopolitical tensions have put the waterway and the country under the microscope from both American and Chinese interests. A proposed $23 billion mega-deal which would see Hong Kong’s CK Hutchison sell off the Balboa and Cristóbal ports, as well as more than 40 others worldwide, to a consortium of MSC and BlackRock, has been in limbo since the summer. That acquisition occurred weeks after U.S. President Donald Trump returned to office, and was considered a massive win for his administration as it aims to curb Chinese influence in the region. Conversely, Beijing and China’s President Xi Jinping were unhappy with the deal, with China’s antitrust regulator opening a probe into that transaction, and later pushing for state-owned Cosco’s inclusion. The acquisition is under scrutiny from some in Panama’s government as well, with the country’s Supreme Court currently presiding over a lawsuit that alleges Hutchison’s recent 25-year extension to operate the Balboa and Cristóbal ports is illegal. If the high court rules in the favor of the comptroller general who filed the suit, the port sale would be annulled. If the contract is voided, it would take between 12 and 18 months to get a new concession tender ready, said José Ramón Icaza, Panama’s minister of canal affairs. “We don’t control the scenarios, but what I can say is that President [José Raúl] Mulino and a few members of his cabinet, including myself, are working on a plan for any of those scenarios and that if we have to take control of Balboa and Cristóbal we don’t create a disruption of the supply chain in the region,” Icaza said. The constant tug-of-war among the parties has driven concerns among ACP leadership that a concentration of terminal operators at the canal-adjacent ports would pose risks to the waterway’s neutrality. Panama’s $2.6 billion port project is one tranche of a wider 10-year, $8.5 billion plan to modernize the canal by 2023. The plan includes the $1.6 billion construction of the Indio Rio reservoir, which will be built to supplement the canal’s main supply of water from Lake Gatún and add capacity for an additional 11 to 13 daily transits. Additionally, the other major project within the 10-year blueprint is a 76-kilometer (47-mile) liquefied gas pipeline that could transfer up to 2.5 million barrels per day between the Corozal and Telfers terminals without sailing them through the canal.

Title: Oracle and IPDN signal next phase of tokenization as RWA market surges

Time Published: 2025-10-28T20:00:49Z

Oracle and IPDN are building the next layer of institutional blockchain infrastructure. The moves highlight how legacy firms are accelerating real-world asset adoption. Both companies are capitalizing on institutional demand for blockchain-based settlement and compliant RWA trading infrastructure. According to a16z and HTX Ventures, the tokenized asset market has surged to $30 billion, quadrupling in just two years. Oracle and Professional Diversity Network [IPDN] are the latest traditional firms diving into blockchain infrastructure, underscoring a rapid shift toward institutional-grade tokenization. Oracle announced the launch of its Digital Assets Data Nexus platform on 27 October. It is built to help banks and financial institutions issue, manage, and settle tokenized assets on-chain. Meanwhile, IPDN also revealed a strategic collaboration with QBSG Limited to develop a global Real-World Asset (RWA) Exchange. This is designed to bridge regulated capital markets with blockchain rails. Together, the two announcements mark a new front in the corporate tokenization race. Legacy tech firms and public companies are now building infrastructure to bring traditional finance fully on-chain. Recent on-chain data show the RWA market has entered a period of exponential growth. According to a16z crypto report, the total RWA market has expanded fourfold in the past two years, reaching $30 billion in tokenized value. Additionally, BlackRock leads the pack with $2.6 billion in tokenized Treasuries, while Ethereum hosts $9.6 billion in total RWA issuance. Data also indicates that tokenized private credit is valued between $12–$16 billion. This represents over half of all RWA activity. Oracle’s entry shows a major shift in how institutions approach blockchain adoption. Its new platform promises compliance-ready infrastructure for on-chain settlement. This is a critical component as major banks move toward tokenized credit and liquidity products. Similarly, IPDN’s RWA Exchange adds a regulated marketplace layer, supporting the tokenization of equities, real estate, and commodities. Both efforts align with broader industry moves by JPMorgan, Citi, and BlackRock, all of which have unveiled tokenization pilots this year. From private credit to tokenized Treasuries, real-world assets are no longer a niche experiment; they’re becoming the backbone of institutional blockchain adoption. Oracle and IPDN’s latest moves reinforce that the race to tokenize traditional finance is now firmly underway — and the market, already worth tens of billions, is just getting started.

Title: Securitize to go public via $1.25 billion SPAC deal

Securitize, a pioneering platform in asset tokenization, has announced its intention to go public through a merger with Cantor Equity Partners II, valuing the company at $1.25 billion. The platform disclosed the strategic move on October 28, 2025, with this set to mark a major development for the tokenization industry. Securitize is at the forefront of bringing global financial institutions onchain. The move sees it join a growing number of crypto-focused companies going public across Wall Street and elsewhere. In its case, the platform, renowned for its role in tokenizing assets for entities such as BlackRock and Apollo, will merge with Cantor Equity Partners II as it eyes the $1.25 billion listing. Cantor Equity Partners is a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) sponsored by Cantor Fitzgerald. The transaction is anticipated to generate up to $469 million in gross proceeds, including a $225 million private investment in public equity (PIPE) financing round. This capital infusion will enhance Securitize’s ability to scale its operations and advance its mission of making capital markets more accessible and efficient through tokenization. 8/ The deal is expected to deliver $469M of gross proceeds consisting of an upsized $225 million in committed common stock PIPE, anchored by new and existing blue-chip institutional investors, and $244 million of cash held in CEPT’s trust account, assuming no redemptions. — Securitize (@Securitize) October 28, 2025 The merged entity, to be renamed Securitize Corp., will list on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “SECZ.” Going public sees Securitize cement its position as a leader in the tokenization space. The platform, which has facilitated over $4 billion in tokenized assets, could attract even more attention as a public entity. The company’s platform offers a comprehensive ecosystem, integrating with major blockchains and financial institutions. It stands out as the first vertically integrated, SEC-registered tokenization provider. BlackRock and Apollo are among firms to tokenize funds with Securitize. “This is a defining moment for Securitize and for the future of finance,” said Carlos Domingo, co-founder and chief executive officer of Securitize. “We founded this company with a mission to democratize capital markets by making them more accessible, transparent, and efficient through tokenization. This is the next chapter in making financial markets operate at the speed of the internet and is another step in our mission to bring the next generation of finance onchain and tokenize the world.” The public listing of Securitize is expected to accelerate the adoption of tokenization across traditional financial markets. Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Brandon Lutnick noted: “We believe that blockchain technology has massive potential to transform finance, and partnering with Securitize underscores our confidence in tokenization as a foundational force in the next era of capital markets.” The real-world asset (RWA) tokenization market has expanded by 135% over the past year, reaching a total value of $35 billion, according to recent data. Analysts at Citi project that the tokenized RWA sector could climb to nearly $4 trillion by 2030.

Vanguard Group has turned artificial intelligence from a pilot program into a profit engine, generating more than $500 million in measurable business value across customer service, analytics and software development, according to MIT Sloan Management Review. The $11 trillion asset manager’s methodical rollout shows how large financial institutions can use AI to boost productivity while maintaining trust, governance and employee engagement.

Δ As mentioned in MIT Sloan analysis on Monday (Oct. 27), Vanguard’s first wave of AI deployments focused on service and productivity. Its “Crew Assist” tool, powered by Azure OpenAI, helps call-center representatives handle investor inquiries more efficiently, while an automated report generator produces customized market summaries for more than 150,000 advisers. Both tools have reduced call-handling times and improved customer satisfaction. The firm’s “Digital Advisor” applies machine learning to model job-loss risk and unemployment duration, tailoring financial-planning recommendations even for clients with minimal balances. A separate call-summarization model automatically drafts meeting notes and follow-ups, reducing administrative work by nearly 50 percent. Vanguard’s research arm has also trained a large-language model on 22,000 corporate earnings-call transcripts to forecast dividend cuts. Companies flagged as negative were five times more likely to announce reductions within a month, underscoring how generative models can supplement traditional financial analysis. As reported by MIT Sloan, Chief Information Officer Nitin Tandon said AI is “embedded where it makes the most difference in decisions that improve investor outcomes and streamline how our teams deliver value.” While Vanguard has taken a focused, high-ROI approach, JPMorgan Chase is expanding AI across the enterprise. Its “LLM Suite” supports more than 200,000 employees and includes 175 active AI applications, from automated research assistants to wealth-management tools that helped boost sales. And JPMorgan isn’t the only company to tap into AI-powered tools for insights into wealth management. BlackRock has also integrated generative AI capabilities into Aladdin, its portfolio management platform used by global institutions, providing portfolio managers with faster insights into exposures and scenario analysis. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue Half of Vanguard’s 20,000 employees have completed its internal AI Academy training program, designed to improve literacy and responsible use. Each system is monitored for drift, bias and performance under the company’s governance framework. Chief Data Analytics Officer Ryan Swann told MIT Sloan Review that Vanguard’s success sees “the best outcomes when humans and machines collaborate, not compete.” That approach mirrors findings from the World Economic Forum’s AI in Financial Services report, which found that 70 percent of financial executives expect AI to drive revenue growth but warned that scaling safely depends on workforce readiness and governance discipline. Citigroup is also emphasizing human-AI collaboration through its “agentic AI” system, Stylus Workspaces, which allows employees to perform multi-step workflows, such as market analysis and report summarization, with a single prompt. The tool connects directly to Citi’s internal databases and collaboration platforms, turning AI into an end-to-end task manager. The rollout began in September and is expected to expand globally next year. Across the industry, finance leaders are shifting from cost-based AI metrics to performance-based ones. A PYMNTS report found that CFOs increasingly view AI as a driver of growth and revenue rather than just operational savings, a change reflected in how firms like Vanguard and Citi quantify ROI in business terms rather than experimentation.

Title: Burlington Stores Takes 43K for Jackson Heights Retail Outlet

© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy Burlington Stores, the retailer formerly known as Burlington Coat Factory, has taken 42,575 square feet for a store at the as-yet-unbuilt 72-22 Broadway in the Jackson Heights section of Queens. Adam Heller, Stephen Weber and Joshua Singer from the Heller Organization represented the landlord, Werber Real Estate. Clifford Simon, David Rosen and Jake Simon from CNS Real Estate repped the tenant. The length of the lease and the asking rent were unavailable, though CNS classified the lease as “long-term.” Retail asking rents in Jackson Heights for this quarter equaled around $64.10 per square foot, according to CoStar. Burlington’s new Jackson Heights store is scheduled to open in September 2028. 72-22 Broadway is set to be a 13-story, mixed-use building with 60,000 square feet of retail on three levels, with two floors dedicated to office and the rest multifamily residential, Clifford Simon told CO. “Burlington’s arrival is a strong addition to the Jackson Heights community, bringing much-needed affordable soft goods to one of the city’s busiest transit hubs,” Heller said in an email to CO. “We’re excited about the continued momentum in the area as this corridor continues to thrive as a key shopping destination in Queens.” Traded was first to note the lease, which was signed in August. Burlington has been busy on several fronts after opening 101 new stores in 2024 and aiming for around the same number this year. The company took over 45 leases from Joann in May 2025, including at 535 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, following Joann’s second bankruptcy filing in January 2025. The month before, Burlington paid over $257 million to BlackRock to acquire an 889,445-square-foot industrial warehouse in Southern California where the company had been the sole tenant since 2019, as CO previously reported. Burlington also signed a 12-year, 77,970-square-foot lease at RXR and Hudson Bay Capital’s 620 Avenue of the Americas in December 2024 in a move from 695 Avenue of the Americas, as CO previously reported. The company took over the spot of the former Bed, Bath & Beyond outlet. Werber Real Estate, as Roosevelt 72 LLC, purchased the Jackson Heights site — also using the address 72-11 Roosevelt Avenue, according to public records — from Delco Properties for $24 million in May 2020. Representatives for Burlington Stores, Werber Real Estate and the Heller Organization did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

"Owning crypto assets or gold are assets of fear," Fink said during his appearance at the Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh, according to a Bloomberg report. "You own these assets because you're frightened of the debasement of your assets. You're worried about your financial security. You're worried about your physical security." “The renewed focus on the so‑called ‘debasement trade’—where investors move away from fiat currencies into hard assets—is rooted in a clear trend: purchasing power is weakening in light of both fiscal and monetary policy leeway, especially on the U.S. dollar side,” Fabian Dori, Chief Investment Officer at Sygnum Bank, told Decrypt. “There are good reasons why private investors, banks, and institutions may start to hedge using Bitcoin,” he added, while warning that 24/7 volatility demands new risk systems and round-the-clock liquidity management. The concerns come as the U.S. government's debt burden is projected to exceed levels in both Italy and Greece for the first time this century. General government gross debt in the U.S. will surge by more than 20 percentage points to reach 143.4% of GDP by 2030, surpassing pandemic-era records, according to IMF forecasts. The IMF estimates the U.S. budget deficit will remain above 7% of GDP annually until 2030, the highest among rich nations tracked by the fund. Fink has gone from calling cryptos such as Bitcoin “the domain of money launderers and thieves” in 2017 to describing himself as a “major believer” in 2024, saying it’s “an instrument you invest in when you’re more frightened.” Two weeks ago, he told CBS that markets force constant reassessment, adding that crypto has "a role in the same way there is a role for gold, that is, it's an alternative." With BlackRock managing $12.5 trillion in assets and operating the largest crypto ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust, with $93.9 billion under management, his views carry substantial weight across global markets. Nic Puckrin, crypto analyst and co-founder of The Coin Bureau, told Decrypt that while Bitcoin originated as an "asset of fear" in response to the 2008 financial crisis, crypto has evolved into "a risk-on bet on the future of blockchain technology and an entirely new, borderless financial system." Bitcoin and blue-chip tokens remain viewed as hedges against fiat devaluation, Puckrin said, calling it "a secular trend, not just a short-term fear-based strategy." Bitcoin is currently trading at around $114,820, down 0.4% in the past 24 hours, per CoinGecko data. Meanwhile, users of prediction market Myriad, launched by Decrypt’s parent company Dastan, expect that Bitcoin will not outperform gold this year, suggesting lingering uncertainty about crypto's volatility despite growing institutional adoption. Sygnum’s Dori pointed to U.S. public entities exploring strategic reserves, major managers positioning Bitcoin as collateral, and the CME’s move toward 24/7 crypto derivatives as signs that the “pieces of the puzzle are coming together.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: US spot Bitcoin ETF balances are negative without BlackRock

Without BlackRock's IBIT, Bitcoin ETFs face potential outflows, showcasing a fragile market balance. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Over the past year, Bitcoin’s exchange-traded fund (ETF) boom has been celebrated as proof that Wall Street has finally embraced crypto. Yet the numbers reveal something far more fragile. On Oct. 28, Vetle Lunde, head of research at K33 Research, noted that US-traded Bitcoin ETFs have attracted about $26.9 billion in inflows year-to-date. However, that headline figure hides a stark imbalance that BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) alone accounts for roughly $28.1 billion of those flows. In other words, Bitcoin ETFs would be in net outflows this year without IBIT. The product’s relentless accumulation has single-handedly offset redemptions across competitors, keeping aggregate inflows positive and sustaining Bitcoin’s narrative of institutional adoption. Since launching in early 2024, IBIT has dominated every major performance metric in the ETF ecosystem. According to SoSo Value data, it has seen about $65.3 billion in lifetime inflows, compared to $21.3 billion across all other Bitcoin funds combined. Meanwhile, Grayscale’s GBTC has suffered roughly $24.6 billion in redemptions, confirming that without IBIT, the aggregate picture would be deeply negative. This effectively means that BlackRock’s IBIT scale stands in a league of its own. The fund drew $37 billion in its debut year and has added another $28 billion so far in 2025, pushing its total assets under management past $90 billion, which is well ahead of any competitor. According to Coinperps data, Bitcoin ETFs collectively hold about 1.3 million BTC, and IBIT accounts for over 60% of that entire stash. A significant part of IBIT’s growth can be linked to the fact that BlackRock has used its $12.5 trillion AUM, retail brokerage channels, and institutional relationships to channel demand into a single flagship product. The asset manager’s entry into the emerging industry instantly conferred legitimacy on a sector still reeling from the broader crisis of trust. Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg ETF Analyst, said: “When BlackRock filed for IBIT, the price was $30,000 and the stench of FTX was still in air. It’s now [over] $110k (a return that is 7x that of the mighty S&P 500) and is now seen as legitimate for other big investors.” Apart from that, the fund’s recent success can also be linked to how Bitcoin has transformed BlackRock’s investor base. Last year, the firm revealed that three out of four IBIT investors were entirely new to BlackRock’s iShare product suite. This shows that IBIT has become not just a crypto ETF but also a client-acquisition engine for the world’s largest asset manager. Indeed, the asset manager’s custom creation mechanisms have become increasingly popular among large Bitcoin holders, or “whales,” who were once wary of traditional financial institutions. These mechanisms allow investors to transfer their Bitcoin directly to the ETF in exchange for new shares, bypassing the need to sell on the open market. So far, the firm has reportedly processed over $3 billion in such in-kind transfers, reflecting the strong confidence in its custodial design and long-term exposure model. This strong dominance has created a halo effect that has proven very profitable for BlackRock. Barely more than a year old, IBIT already ranks as BlackRock’s top ten revenue generators, surpassing long-standing funds like the iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF. IBIT’s overarching dominance of the Bitcoin ETF space begs the question of what will happen when its numbers eventually slow down. If IBIT’s inflows taper, the immediate impact would be felt across market liquidity and price stability. At its current size, even a modest reduction in buying could remove a significant source of consistent demand. That demand has acted as a quasi-monetary inflow, offsetting miner sell pressure and exchange outflows. A slowdown would therefore widen spreads on US spot exchanges, reduce arbitrage opportunities for market makers, and weaken the feedback loop that has kept Bitcoin’s price anchored above key support levels. In essence, the ETF bid has become Bitcoin’s floor, and IBIT is most of that bid. The knock-on effects would also ripple through institutional sentiment. If month-over-month flows turn negative, family offices and RIA desks benchmarking performance to IBIT could rebalance away from Bitcoin ETFs entirely. That withdrawal would lower the “liquidity premium” currently embedded in Bitcoin’s price. Finally, a sustained stagnation in IBIT inflows could shift capital toward Ethereum and newly launched altcoins ETFs, eroding Bitcoin’s dominance ratio. However, Lunde pointed out that BlackRock’s absence from these product suites could limit their overall net flows. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: What Is the Fate of Altcoin ETFs Without BlackRock Presence?

© 2025 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. BlackRock was instrumental in the success of spot Bitcoin ETFs, dampening sentiment with its boycott of altcoin ETFs. In this year alone, Bitcoin BTC $110 867 24h volatility: 2.0% Market cap: $2.21 T Vol. 24h: $73.64 B Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) have recorded net inflows of $26.9 billion, per K33 Research. Out of this massive flow, top asset management firm BlackRock accounted for a total of $28.1 billion, covering the losses from other issuers, including Grayscale Investments. This outlook has prompted the question, “What is the fate of altcoin ETFs without BlackRock’s presence?” Even though Bitcoin ETFs recorded $26.9 billion in net inflows this year, it is obvious that BlackRock contributed the major percentage of this value. Precisely, the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) rakes in $28.1 billion in inflows. This shows that without this fund, Bitcoin ETF flows would be negative. According to K33 Research, Bitcoin ETFs have recorded $26.9 billion in net inflows this year, with BlackRock’s IBIT accounting for $28.1 billion. Excluding BlackRock, Bitcoin ETF flows would be negative. K33 noted that while competitors may gain an edge as BlackRock stays out of… pic.twitter.com/wpaCvqzRSV — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) October 28, 2025 The same positive trend was seen around the BlackRock iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA), as it dominated inflows on several occasions. Unfortunately, BlackRock has decided to stay out of the current altcoin ETF wave that is now gaining traction. 21Shares, Canary Capital, Fidelity, and many other asset managers have all filed for one or an altcoin ETF with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the last year. Unlike these firms, BlackRock has not pursued a similar filing. Given the strong performance of the first two crypto ETFs, the upcoming funds may face challenges in achieving the same level of traction. In other words, their overall inflows could be limited, despite the massive hype trailing their respective listings. In mid-October, VanEck filed for the Lido Staked Ethereum ETF with the US SEC. Just a week before this filing, it filed a statutory trust registration for the same Ethereum ETF in Delaware. This fund is designed to track spot Lido Staked ETH (stETH) prices based on MarketVector’s LDO Staked Ethereum Benchmark Rate index. Back in August, Bitwise Asset Management submitted an S-1 filing to the US SEC to launch a spot Chainlink ETF to track the price of LINK LINK $18.32 24h volatility: 3.0% Market cap: $12.76 B Vol. 24h: $1.22 B . Details in the filing suggest standard creation and redemption mechanisms, noting that the trust can process both in-kind and cash transactions. It intends to utilize a “Trust-Directed Trade” system managed by the prime execution agent to achieve this. Interestingly, these altcoin ETFs are waiting for a green light from the SEC.

The company’s common stock will trade on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “SECZ” once the transaction is completed, Securitize said. The firm will also issue digital representations of its stock on a blockchain, the company added. Securitize expects up to $469 million in proceeds from the proposed merger, which would stem from a private placement in public equity and Cantor Equity Partners II’s trust account. Existing backers, including BlackRock–the world’s largest asset manager–and financial services giants ARK Invest, and Morgan Stanley Investment Management, will see their equity rolled into the combined company, Securitize said. The stock price of Cantor Equity Partners II, an affiliate of the firm linked to U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, fell 7% on Tuesday to $11.93, according to Yahoo Finance. Securitize offers a platform enabling companies to manage issuance of real-world assets on-chain, including stock and money market funds. Last March, the company helped BlackRock debut its $2.8 billion USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL). Several crypto firms have debuted on Wall Street this year as U.S. regulators and lawmakers have moved to bring clarity to the industry. Securitize CEO Carlos Domingo told Decrypt that Circle’s blockbuster IPO in June provided ample motivation. “We started thinking, maybe this makes sense for us,” he said. “We’ve been really pushing for the company to become profitable, and I think there are a lot of opportunities.” Domingo described BlackRock’s BUIDL as a “catalyst” for tokenization, and last month, Securitize reached an agreement with FG Nexus, a Nasdaq-listed Ethereum treasury firm, to issue a tokenized version of its stock on Ethereum. Securitize’s tokenization platform underpins $22 billion worth of real-world assets, but Citi analysts have projected that the sector could reach $5 trillion by the end of the decade. Having a big balance sheet gives Securitize the opportunity to participate in consolidating the industry, as opposed to being scooped up by a larger firm, Domingo said. Domingo said that Securitize’s public debut will likely take place early next year, depending on how the regulatory process plays out and when the U.S. government shutdown ends. “We’ve built a real company with 230 employees, revenue, growth, [and] profits,” he said. “We’re just scratching the surface of what the industry is.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: BlackRock Holds the Line as Bitcoin ETFs Reveal Fragile Foundations | US Crypto News

Time Published: 2025-10-28T15:20:36Z

Written byLockridge Okoth Edited byMohammad Shahid Welcome to the US Crypto News Morning Briefing—your essential rundown of the most important developments in crypto for the day ahead. Grab a coffee to read how institutional flows tell a story of dominance, dependency, and deep accumulation. At the center stands BlackRock, propping up a fragile ETF ecosystem that may not stand so tall without it. BlackRock’s IBIT contributed $28.1 billion in year-to-date net inflows to US Bitcoin ETFs, surpassing sector gains and revealing a fragile foundation for institutional crypto adoption. Outside IBIT, Bitcoin ETFs faced negative flows, raising concerns over broader market confidence. On October 27, US Bitcoin ETFs saw inflows of 1,300 BTC (about $149.3 million), equal to three days’ worth of new Bitcoin. This demonstrates lasting institutional demand, yet nearly all of it goes through IBIT. Competitors continue to face challenges, even as interest in digital assets grows. Recent figures show a stark pattern. BlackRock’s IBIT has driven the net positive flows for US Bitcoin ETFs, outpacing rivals. According to Farside Investors, US Bitcoin ETFs reported $26.9 billion in net inflows this year, but $28.1 billion came from IBIT. Without IBIT, flows in other ETFs, such as Fidelity’s FBTC and Bitwise’s BITB, were flat or negative. “No BlackRock, no party? BTC ETFs are up $26.9bn YTD, yet $28.1bn stems from BlackRock’s IBIT. Ex-IBIT, flows are negative. BlackRock is absent from the imminent altcoin ETF wave. Opportunity for competitors to secure strong flows, but on net, likely limiting for overall flows,” wrote Velte Lunde, head of research at K33 Research. This reliance on one fund signals a critical vulnerability. If BlackRock scales back, institutional inflows could fade quickly. Such concentration can shape the perception of ongoing institutional confidence in global finance. On the same day as notable Bitcoin inflows, US Ethereum ETFs added 32,220 ETH, worth $133.9 million according to Farside. While significant, no Ethereum ETF has achieved IBIT’s dominance. This indicates growing yet more distributed interest from institutions exploring beyond Bitcoin. Meanwhile, Bitwise data shows that banks, asset managers, and payment companies treat crypto as a core part of finance. Transitioning from niche to mainstream, large firms are deepening exposure through custody, tokenization, and ETF products. This kind of change would have been unlikely just a few years ago. “Institutions are quietly going all in. Banks, funds, and payment giants keep adding exposure every week. Crypto’s no longer a side bet – it’s becoming part of the system,” wrote analyst Kyle Doops. Research by CoinShares confirms this trend. Bitcoin investment products drew $931 million in inflows for the week ending October 24, 2025, bringing the annual total to $30.2 billion. Yet, a sharp outflow the previous week highlights ongoing volatility and shifting sentiment that still affect the crypto markets.

Title: Forget the debasement trade: 2 reasons the US is the best place to keep your money, according to BlackRock chief Larry Fink.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Larry Fink isn't losing a lot of sleep over the debasement trade. The BlackRock CEO said he's still confident that US assets are the best place for investors to park their cash for at least the next 18 months. That's despite fears swirling around the debasement trade, which is the idea that investors are fleeing from dollar-denominated assets due to concerns that the US dollar is losing value, and that rising debt levels and deficit spending will broadly hurt fiat currencies. "Money is going to move around all the time. But I would say most global investors have a very large overweight in the US and I think that's going to be the best place to have your overweighting for at least the next 18 months," Fink said, speaking at a panel discussion in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. There are a few reasons Fink thinks investors' focus should still be on US markets. First, the sell-off in US assets earlier this year has largely reversed. Investors fled US stocks and other dollar assets in early 2025 as concerns mounted over tariffs, America's credit rating, and the nation's growing debt balance. But that move has largely reversed in recent months, Fink said. Foreign demand for US assets saw a strong rebound in May and June despite net selling in April, analysis from Apollo Global Management showed. Meanwhile, other safe-haven alternatives to US assets, like gold, are retreating after a big rally that some observers say was largely driven by FOMO rather than fundamental fears about financial stability. Second, there's huge faith in the investment being poured into the US, Fink said. He pointed in particular to capital expenditures spending related to AI, tech, energy infrastructure, and data centers. Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Google — four of the biggest companies at the center of the artificial intelligence boom — could be on track to spend as much as $320 billion on capex this year, according to a Business Insider analysis of the companies' financial statements. "You're seeing all that happening more in the United States than most places in the world today," Fink said, attributing large investment to why the US GDP has outpaced European nations. Other market pros have expressed doubt over the debasement theory. JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, and Apollo are among the top Wall Street forecasters that have been skeptical about the "sell America" narrative this year, thanks largely to the excitement for investment opportunities in the US. The US dollar has also remained stable against other currencies in recent months, Capital Economics said in a note to clients on Monday. The 10-year US Treasury has also rallied, the firm added, signaling that investors haven't lost confidence in Treasurys. Jump to

Title: Tariffs Fuel Inflation Fears Among Insurance Companies

Time Published: 2025-10-28T14:14:00Z

Insurance firms see inflation as the biggest threat to their investment strategy over the next year, per a BlackRock report. The possibility that tariff wars will create a knock-on effect leading to higher inflation over the next year is by far the biggest concern among insurance companies during that time period, according to BlackRock’s annual “Global Insurance Report.” “Inflation remains a key concern, particularly with the renewed imposition of tariffs and their potential ripple effects,” the report stated. “Escalating geopolitical tensions and increasing market fragmentation are also shaping insurers’ investment strategies and outlook.” The report also noted that the sustained higher-interest-rate environment, combined with ongoing regulatory developments, is forcing insurance firms to adjust their strategies “to navigate a rapidly evolving landscape.” The report analyzed a survey of 463 senior investment professionals at firms representing an aggregate of $23 trillion in assets under management. It found that 63% of those surveyed cited inflation risk when asked what they consider to be the “most serious macro conditions” affecting their companies’ investment strategy during the next 12 months. This is a big jump from last year, when inflation risk ranked fifth, with only 46% of insurers saying it worried them the most. Never miss a story — sign up for CIO newsletters to stay up-to-date on the latest institutional investment industry news.  With respondents able to select more than one option, “rising geopolitical tension and fragmentation” was a distant second, with 50% naming it as their biggest concern. A “high-rate environment” was cited by 42%, while “regulatory developments” and “recession risk” were cited by 40% and 35% of respondents, respectively. In last year’s survey, the top concern among insurance companies was regulatory developments, cited by 68% of respondents, followed by rising geopolitical tensions and a high-rate environment at 61% and 58%, respectively, while 50% cited the risk of a recession. This year’s report also found that insurance companies have lost their appetite to increase risk, down to just 12% in 2025 from 60% in 2021. However, they are still eating up private market investments, with 30% of insurers saying they expect to increase their allocation to the asset class over the next 12 months and only 12% reporting they plan to cut back on private assets. Some 79% said they plan to raise their allocation to private markets by 1% to 5%; 13% said they expect to increase their exposure to private markets by 6% to 9%; and 1% said they plan to boost their private assets by at least 10% over the next 12 months. Within private markets, insurance companies reported the most interest in single-strategy direct lending, named by 39% of respondents, followed by special situations/opportunistic investments at 38% and citing infrastructure debt at 37%.

Solana officially joins Bitcoin and Ethereum in the ETF arena as the first U.S. spot Solana ETFs go live. 📌 What Happened Four new crypto ETFs will begin trading this week across Nasdaq and the NYSE, led by Solana, Litecoin, and Hedera. The big headline is Solana, which will see two ETFs go live: The Bitwise ETF will track 100% spot SOL and is designed to participate in staking, meaning it could compound yield through validator rewards over time. The Litecoin and Hedera ETFs, both from Canary Capital, also begin trading Tuesday. This is the first wave of altcoin ETFs to reach U.S. markets after the Bitcoin ETF launch in January and Ethereum ETF rollout in July. 🗣️ What They’re Saying “Confirmed. The Exchange has just posted listing notices for Bitwise Solana, Canary Litecoin and Canary HBAR to launch TOMORROW and grayscale Solana to convert the day after. Assuming there’s not some last min SEC intervention, looks like this is happening.” - Eric Balchunas, Senior ETF Analyst for Bloomberg 🧠 Why It Matters Solana enters ETF land with serious momentum. SOL is now a top-5 crypto by market cap, trading near $200, and continues to dominate usage metrics with higher daily transactions than Ethereum. And the Solana ETF unlocks new access to SOL for retirement accounts, wealth advisors, and institutional portfolios that can’t touch crypto directly. It deepens liquidity and puts Solana in the same regulated bucket as BTC and ETH, something nearly unthinkable during the FTX collapse just two years ago. That means inflows and diversification buying is incoming. But, with that said, there is one key difference between these SOL ETFs and BTC & ETH - BlackRock isn’t at the table (yet). BlackRock’s IBIT (BTC) and ETHA (ETH) are the dominant players in their respective categories of ETFs. IBIT has seen $65B in net inflows. The next biggest is FBTC at $12B (so 5x bigger). Similarly, ETHA has seen $14.2B in net inflows. The next biggest is Fidelity’s FETH at $2.69B (also ~5x bigger). So while there is reason to celebrate these new ETFs, especially for SOL - take them with a grain of salt.

Description: BlackRock was the only reason Bitcoin ETF investments didn’t turn negative in 2025, raising concerns for altcoin ETF performances without the asset manager.
