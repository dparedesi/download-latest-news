Title: CoinEx Research Releases Landmark Report on the RWA Tokenization Revolution
URL: https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/07/21/3118490/0/en/CoinEx-Research-Releases-Landmark-Report-on-the-RWA-Tokenization-Revolution.html

July 21, 2025 04:40 ET | Source: CoinEx CoinEx HONG KONG, July 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CoinEx Research, the research division of global crypto exchange CoinEx, has officially released its latest in-depth two-part report: “Unlocking the On-Chain Asset Era: A Deep Dive into the Real World Asset (RWA) Tokenization Revolution (Part I & II).” The report systematically examines the RWA landscape—from foundational infrastructure and regulatory frameworks to the practical deployment of tokenized asset classes—and signals the arrival of RWAs as a core pillar of the next wave of financial innovation. Key Insight I: The On-Chain Asset Era Is Accelerating The report highlights that RWA tokenization is fast becoming the critical bridge between traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi). As of June 2025, RWA-related protocols have locked $12.7 billion in total value, up 69% year-to-date. Yield-bearing assets such as tokenized U.S. Treasuries and private credit are growing rapidly under clearer regulatory regimes, led by institutional giants like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton. Notably, BlackRock’s BUIDL fund alone commands 44% of the tokenized Treasuries market with $2.5 billion in TVL. CoinEx Research believes RWAs are transitioning from early experimentation to institutional-scale adoption, marking a clear inflection point in the on-chain asset revolution. Key Insight II: Five Core Asset Classes Define the Tokenized Financial Landscape In Part II of the report, CoinEx Research analyzes five of the most impactful RWA asset types, detailing how each class is evolving in design, adoption, and regulatory complexity: CoinEx Research emphasizes that as compliance, yield, and liquidity converge, these asset classes will serve as foundational components of an on-chain financial system. Key Insight III: Regulatory Clarity & Infrastructure Enable Institutional Entry The report outlines two critical enablers for mainstream RWA adoption: Over 59% of non-stablecoin RWA value is currently hosted on Ethereum, underlining its institutional composability and regulatory alignment. CoinEx Research’s Outlook: RWAs as the Foundation of On-Chain Capital Markets CoinEx Research concludes that RWAs are not just symbolic tools—they are the building blocks of real on-chain capital markets. With scalable legal, custodial, and compliance systems in place, RWAs are now enabling institutions to enter Web3 with safety, efficiency, and clarity. More than just the ability to “tokenize assets,” the real competitive edge will lie in delivering stable, composable, and transparent real-world financial instruments on-chain. Read the Full Report Both Part I and Part II of “Unlocking the On-Chain Asset Era: A Deep Dive into the RWA Tokenization Revolution” are now available on the official CoinEx Research portal. Industry professionals, institutional investors, developers, and policymakers are encouraged to explore the full insights.

Title: Ambani’s Jio Agrees to Reinsurance Venture With Allianz in India

Mukesh Ambani’s Jio Financial Services Ltd. agreed to form a reinsurance venture with Allianz SE in India, advancing the billionaire’s quest to broaden his reach in the sector. The 50-50 venture combines Jio’s local digital footprint with Allianz’s global underwriting and reinsurance capabilities, the companies said in a statement late Friday. Jio and Allianz also signed a non-binding agreement to set up equally owned general and life insurance businesses in India. Bloomberg News previously reported the companies’ joint-venture plan, which expands Ambani’s footprint in the insurance sector. His Jio Financial already offers digital banking and has struck a deal with BlackRock Inc. for investment-fund services. The agreement with Jio comes after the German insurer sold its holdings in ventures with Bajaj Finserv Ltd. in India. The new reinsurance project will start operating after the companies have received statutory and regulatory approval. India’s insurance penetration — the ratio of premiums to gross domestic product — is about 3.7%, well below other Asian countries including Japan, South Korea and Thailand, according to data from the local insurance regulator.

Stablecoin Strategy: Trumpâs team and BlackRock aim to globalize dollar-pegged stablecoins to sustain U.S. financial dominance, channeling capital into Treasuries and delaying a dollar collapse. Digital Currency Takeover: Like past dollarization in Iraq, stablecoins replace local currencies, enforce Treasury demand, and extend dollar supremacy for 10â15 years via tech-driven financial control. Surveillance Risks: Critics warn stablecoins could enable CBDC-like social credit tracking, merging finance with national security while exposing corruption (e.g., Brazil tariff schemes). Broader Financial Looting: Links to Pentagon fund gaps, healthcare plunder (e.g., mRNA shots suppressing life expectancy), and Epstein cover-ups reveal systemic elite exploitation. Resistance Tactics: Ditch propaganda, hoard precious metals, and use unincorporated nonprofits (UNAs) to legally shield assets against centralized financial coup.

Resistance Tactics: Ditch propaganda, hoard precious metals, and use unincorporated nonprofits (UNAs) to legally shield assets against centralized financial coup. President Donald Trumpâs administration is aggressively pushing stablecoinsâdollar-pegged digital currenciesâas part of a strategy to preserve U.S. financial dominance despite soaring national debt, warns financial analyst Catherine Austin Fitts, founder of The Solari Report. In an exclusive interview on Decentralized TV, Fitts revealed that the Trump administrationâalongside figures like BlackRock chairman Larry Finkâaims to internationalize dollar-backed stablecoins, funneling global capital into U.S. Treasuries and delaying an inevitable dollar collapse. "The New Iraqi Pallets of Cash" Fitts compared the plan to past U.S. financial maneuvers, such as flooding post-invasion Iraq with physical dollars to cement dollar reliance. Now, she argues, stablecoins serve as "digital palettes of cash"âcool, tech-savvy vehicles to: Replace local currencies worldwide with dollar-pegged digital money. Force capital into Treasuries, propping up demand for U.S. debt as interest rates spike. Extend dollar supremacy for 10â15 years, avoiding a fiscal reckoning. "This is a hostile takeover of global currencies through tech," Fitts said, referencing legislative efforts like the (GENIES Act) to formalize crypto markets under U.S. control. Critics Fear CBDC Backdoor Despite claims of resisting Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), Fitts warned that dollarized stablecoins could impose social credit surveillance: Example: Brazil tariff front-runningâwhere insiders profited before policy shiftsâshows corruption risks. Real-world control: Palantir- and DoD-backed systems may enforce compliance, merging finance with national security. "Financial Coup DâEtat" Fitts, who documented $21 trillion in missing Pentagon funds (1998â2015), linked the scheme to broader looting: Healthcare plunder: mRNA shots for sick children may artificially suppress life expectancy ("balancing budgets by killing people"). Epstein files erased: Governments buried evidence while VC-backed crypto elites lobbied Washington. How to Resist? Fitts urged pragmatic defiance: Ditch TVsâpropaganda clouds judgment. Stack precious metalsâhedge against currency collapse. Non-corporate entities: Unincorporated nonprofits (UNAs) can shield assets legally. Bottom Line Trumpâs stablecoin gambit may salvage the dollar temporarilyâbut accelerates a centralized financial coup. As Fitts bluntly put it: "If you ignore the great poisoning, you wonât survive."

Title: Why Public Pension Funds Should Still Put Beneficiaries First: A Response to Fisch and Schwartz
URL: https://clsbluesky.law.columbia.edu/2025/07/21/why-public-pension-funds-should-still-put-beneficiaries-first-a-response-to-fisch-and-schwartz/
Time Published: 2025-07-21T04:05:48Z
Full Content:
In a recent article, professors Jill Fisch and Jeff Schwartz argue that the beneficiary primacy model – requiring pension fund trustees to maximize economic value solely for beneficiaries – fundamentally misunderstands the nature of public pension funds. They contend that public pension funds differ critically from private funds because beneficiaries receive defined benefits that do not vary with fund performance. Unlike mutual fund investors who are residual claimants, public pension beneficiaries have contractual claims to fixed payments. As the two professors note, if a public pension fund outperforms, beneficiaries have no claim to the surplus; it belongs to the government. Their solution is as innovative as it is radical: Treat public pension funds as principals rather than intermediaries. Under their model, fund managers would owe fiduciary duties to the fund itself, not to beneficiaries. This would free managers to balance the sometimes-competing interests of multiple stakeholders – employees, taxpayers, local communities, and beneficiaries – guided by state constitutions, legislation, and investment policies. As they argue, “the political nature of public pensions is a feature, not a bug. I will provide the English law perspective, but the UK principles also apply to some extent to Fisch and Schwartz’s U.S. law analysis. I will examine the roles and duties of pension fund trustees, because as Fisch and Schwartz recognize, public pension funds in the U.S. are typically organized as trusts. It has been argued that under U.S. law, the beneficiary primacy principle is a problem because, among other reasons, fund managers or pension fund trustees are not permitted to take into account ESG factors but must maximize the economic value of the fund. Fisch and Schwartz go further, arguing that this principle creates litigation risk and “delegitimizes values-based fund management decisions,” forcing fund managers to make disingenuous claims that all ESG decisions maximize returns. But while the beneficiary primacy principle is recognized under English law, it is more nuanced. For pension fund trustees to address ESG issues, it is unnecessary and undesirable to reframe a pension fund as a principal to which trustees solely owe duties. This reframing subverts well-established tenets of trusts law and fiduciary law. In my view, under English law, pension fund trustees are already legally permitted, and under certain circumstances may even be legally required, to consider ESG factors, if one of two conditions exist. First, the trustee’s mandate, as stated in the trust deed or legislation allows or requires them to consider these factors. Or second, these factors materially affect the long-term risk-adjusted returns for the beneficiaries.[1]For example, trust-based pension funds are statutorily required to take into account climate-related risks.[2] To begin with, under English law, the fiduciary duties of pension fund trustees primarily consist of promoting the purpose for which the trust was created. This has been interpreted to require the trustees to balance returns against risks[3]; this is different from the maximization of risk-adjusted returns as stated by Fisch and Schwartz. English law generally permits fiduciary duties to be shaped or qualified by the terms of the trust deed, applicable contract or applicable legislation, such that the scope of fiduciary duties has to be interpreted to permit, and may even require, the pension fund trustees to address ESG factors.[4] Fisch and Schwartz argue that courts “contort themselves” to uphold values-based investment decisions while nominally applying the beneficiary primacy principle. They discuss cases like State of West Virginia v. Investment Management Board[5] (upholding mandatory investment in jail bonds) and Board of Trustees v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore City[6] (upholding required divestment from South Africa) as examples where courts strain to find economic justifications for politically motivated decisions. However, under English law, if the trust deed or legislation permits or requires the trustees to consider or even prioritize environmental, social, political, or other kinds of factors, or to make certain investments, the beneficiary primacy principle, which is part of fiduciary duties, is no obstacle at all. This is because the fiduciary duty has been molded or qualified by the trust deed or legislation. Thus, should the facts of State of West Virginia v. Investment Management Board be decided by a UK court, the decision in that case is justifiable because the legislation has given the mandate to the state pension board to invest in jail bonds. Likewise, the decision in the Board of Trustees v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore City is similarly justifiable because the state law requires the public pension funds to divest from companies doing business in South Africa during the apartheid era. This is because the duties of the pension fund trustees had been qualified by, or had to be interpreted in light of, state law. A real difficulty arises when there is no clear mandate, that is, when the trust deed or legislation is silent as to whether pension fund trustees can take into account ESG factors. Fisch and Schwartz argue this creates an “irresolvable and disingenuous” debate where fund managers must artificially claim that all decisions maximize returns. Their solution is to abandon the beneficiary primacy principle entirely. One answer provided by the beneficiary primacy principle, as described by Fisch and Schwartz, is that pension fund trustees are not allowed to do so because their sole and overriding duty is to maximize the returns of their beneficiaries. But under English law, while pension funds trustees must act in the exclusive interests of beneficiaries, this does not mean they have to maximize returns. Rather, the beneficiary primacy principle requires trustees to balance returns against risks. As the 2024 UK Financial Markets Law Committee (FMLC) makes clear in its important paper, “Pension Fund Trustees and Fiduciary Duties: Decision-making in the Context of Sustainability and the Subject of Climate Change”, pension fund trustees can balance returns against risks at three levels:[7] the specific investment level, the portfolio level, and the level of whole economies material to the pension fund. This framework elegantly addresses many of Fisch and Schwartz’s concerns about economically targeted investments (ETIs). They explain how public pension funds have invested in local infrastructure, affordable housing, and small businesses – investments critics condemn as creating politically motivated conflicts of interest. But under the FMLC approach, these can be justified at the third level of analysis. Thus, trustees are allowed to consider ESG or political factors to the extent they constitute material financial risks or opportunities that can affect the returns of the beneficiaries. Should a UK court decide the case of Withers v. Teachers Retirement System of New York City[8], the court is likely to affirm the decision of the fund manager because, had the pension funds not bought the state bonds, the state, which is a major contributor to and guarantor of the funds’ assets, would have become bankrupt. And this would materially affect the returns of the beneficiaries. I do not find the court’s interpretation to be particularly strained. The ETIs, which are designed to benefit low-income earners, can be justified on this basis, because the creation of affordable housing and employment can spur economic growth, which will in turn improve the returns for the beneficiaries. This reasoning may seem tenuous. But recall that under the UK approach, as pension fund trustees can balance returns against risks at the whole economies level that are material to the fund, the ETIs can be justified on this basis. It is within the discretionary judgment of pension fund trustees to conclude that a badly performing economy, caused by unemployment, can affect the long-term risk-adjusted returns for the beneficiaries. Fisch and Schwartz document extensive public pension fund activism on social issues – from New York City Employees’ Retirement System’s 1992 proposal on sexual orientation discrimination at Cracker Barrel to recent fossil fuel divestments. They argue that putting beneficiaries first forces funds to make disingenuous economic arguments for these values-based decisions. In my opinion, even if the pension fund trustees are motivated by their moral or ideological views when they make ETIs or when they consider ESG factors, they may not breach their fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the beneficiaries. This is because under English law, taking into account non-financial factors is permissible, if two tests are met: first, trustees should have good reason to think that the beneficiaries would share the concern; and second, the decision should not involve a risk of significant financial detriment to the fund.[9] What if the first test is met but not the second? Can the fiduciary still take into account and give effect to these non-financial considerations such as advancing the net-zero agenda or implementing the Paris Agreement? There may be support for an affirmative answer in a 2022 English High Court decision. In Butler-Sloss v. Charity Commission for England and Wales[10], the trustees of two charitable organizations sought a declaration from the court that they were not in breach of their fiduciary duties by aligning their proposed investment policy with the Paris Agreement and therefore with the wishes of their respective charities, even if doing so would lead to lower returns for their beneficiaries. The goals and objectives of the investment policy were to “protect and enhance the trust’s financial returns and support its charitable objectives” and in doing so, “align its investments with the Paris Climate Agreement.” To implement the policy, the trustees decided on an investment that had the highest percentage of green funds but there would be financial detriment in the short term, the precise amount of which the trustees could not determine. The Attorney General and Charity Commissioner took the view that the potential financial detriment would conflict with the trust’s purposes. But the court disagreed, holding that the trustees had discharged their duties and struck the right balance between giving effect to the goals and objectives of the investment policy, which included aligning investments with the Paris Agreement, and the financial detriment that would ensue. In my view, this case suggests that English courts may defer to a fiduciary’s balance between risk-adjusted returns and non-financial considerations – even if it causes short-term financial detriment – provided that the trust’s purpose permits such investments and specifically includes these non-financial objectives. Where the trust lacks such provisions, the fiduciary must ascertain the beneficiaries’ preferences, which may be challenging. Where regulations or guidelines require or expect asset managers, asset owners, and pension fund trustees to make climate-related disclosures, the fiduciary duties of these entities – here the beneficiary primacy principle – have to be interpreted in that light. For example, the UK Financial Conduct Authority has issued similar disclosure rules or guidelines.[11] This means that asset managers must consider climate-related risks as part of their duty to their beneficiaries to balance returns against risks. This is an example of how the common law fiduciary duties have been molded or qualified by regulation. In my view, under English law, it is unnecessary to overturn the longstanding principle that trustees owe duties only to beneficiaries. Nor is it desirable to assert the controversial claim that public pension fund trustees owes duties only to the public pension fund understood as a principal. It is difficult to defend the claim that the public pension fund is a principal when, unlike a company, it is not conferred a separate legal personality by the law. Fisch and Schwartz’s reconceptualization, while intellectually bold, would require fundamental changes to well-established trust law principles. More concerningly, completely severing the link between fund managers and beneficiaries could reduce accountability and potentially enable the political manipulation they elsewhere acknowledge – such as when Louisiana’s State Treasurer stopped investing with BlackRock to protect the fossil fuel industry. The English law approach achieves most of their legitimate objectives – enabling ESG consideration, supporting local investments, and reflecting public values – while maintaining crucial protections against self-dealing and mismanagement. It recognizes that pension fund trustees operate within a framework shaped by legislation, regulation, and trust documents, but preserves the fundamental principle that they must act in their beneficiaries’ best interests, properly understood.

Mikey Stafford RTÉ Online Sport Editor History is written by the victors and, as is customary, the All-Ireland champions make up almost half of The Sunday Game Team of the Year. Tipperary's second half blitzkrieg led them to an All-Ireland title that looked as unlikely at half-time of the All-Ireland final as it did at full-time of their Munster SHC defeat to Cork. But Liam Cahill's men were victorious, thanks to a rabid defence and a lethal attack, which sees seven men from the Premier County represented in the selection. There is room for four Corkmen, two from Kilkenny and one each from Dublin and Galway. Tipperary's Jake Morris is considered the cream of the crop, the half-forward voted Player of the Year by the RTÉ GAA pundits. Rhys Shelly (Tipperary) Despite becoming the first goalkeeper to score from play in an All-Ireland hurling final with his huge 69th-minute effort, the Moycarkey Borris man has made the grade on the strength of his restarts and his defensive solidity. Conceded eight goals in his first three Championship matches after taking the number one jersey from Barry Hogan, but after that conceded just four in Tipp's remaining four Championship matches (thanks to a penalty save late in the final). Not only were his puckouts long and accurate, he was also adept at getting them away very quickly. Robert Doyle (Tipperary) A wonderful debut inter-county season is made all the more remarkable by the fact the Clonoulty-Rossmore man plays corner-forward for his club. That might explain his attacking tendencies, notching a point and a free from right corner-back in an All-Ireland final. His place on this selection was earned thanks to some remarkable man-marking gigs during the year. Dessie Hutchinson, Eoin Cody and Tony Kelly had already been guarded by Doyle before he picked up Alan Connolly earlier today and held the towering Blackrock man to a single point. Huw Lawlor (Kilkenny) The gold standard in terms of inter-county full-backs for a few years now. Following in the proud tradition of no nonsense number threes in stripey jerseys, Brian Cody, Noel Hickey and JJ Delaney would be proud of the O'Loughlin Gaels man's commitment to keeping the game as simple as possible. Low or high, win your ball, secure possession and give it to someone in a better position. Not opposed to the odd jaunt up the field and has been known to raise a white flag or two in his time. Sean O'Donoghue (Cork) Jason Forde's 0-02 tally was by a distance the lowest of Tipp's rampant inside line today and that was thanks to the efforts of the ultra-aggressive O'Donoghue. The former captain from Inniscarra is as honest as they come and holding Aaron Gillane to two points in a Munster final is some going. Eoghan Connolly (Tipperary) Notched his obligatory point from a different timezone against Cork. The Cashel King Cormacs 'full-back' has been a revelation from long distance, both from placed balls and open play, this year, scoring 0-14 in total. Tougher than normal outing from a defensive point of view in the first half as his man Diarmuid Healy scored 0-03 but Connolly, like most of his team-mates, got on top in the second half and Healy made way for Damien Cahalane after the sending off of Eoin Downey. Ronan Maher (Tipperary) What can be said about the towering Thurles Sarsfields man? Goes one better than his revered older brother Pádraic by captaining Tipperary to an All-Ireland title. His peerless ability in the air saw him given the task of shackling Cork's talisman Brian Hayes and he carried out his duty with his usual energy and physicality. With Liam Cahill blooding plenty of young players this year, the experienced Maher was one of the foundation stones around which this Tipp team were built. Ciarán Joyce (Cork) One of Pat Ryan's former Under-20 charges, the Castlemartyr man has now played in and lost two All-Ireland finals at the age of 23. No shame in his performance today however, keeping Tipperary's main man Jake Morris to two points. One-third of Cork's massively influential half-back line, you feel his best is yet to come. Darragh Fitzgibbon (Cork) The modern midfielder that all modern midfielders will be modelled on. Athletic, blessed with boundless energy and ludicrously fast, the Charleville man is too good to have been on successive losing All-Ireland final teams. A massive target for Cork puck-outs and a pest on opposition restarts. Cathal Mannion (Galway) This was a better year for Galway hurling than 2024 (that wouldn't be hard) but where would Micheal Donoghue's team be without Mannion? His 0-17 against Wexford in the Leinster SHC was the display of a hurler in the form of his life. He notched 0-11 of Galway's 1-20 as another Leinster final against Kilkenny came and went. Jake Morris (Tipperary) The Nenagh Éire Óg man has been the leader of Tipperary's lethal attack all year. Like his long-time underage team-mate Ormonde, he is fast and loves to elude opponents with his movement. Economical in possession, will be irked by fact his wides (three) outnumbered his points (two) against Cork... only joking, I'm sure he couldn't give a damn. Andrew Ormond (Tipperary) Pacey, hard-working and blessed with sublime wrists, the JK Brackens man has been one of the finds of the season (despite being around for a few years since winning an Under-20 All-Ireland in 2019). His two points in as many minutes at the start of the second half were vital in Tipp's bewilderment of Cork. One of several Tipp forwards who revels in turning over possession. Cian O’Sullivan (Dublin) In a bright year for Dublin hurling, no one shone brighter than the St Brigid's man. On the inter-county scene since 2018 he looks invigorated by the Niall Ó Ceallacháin project and the talented sharpshooter adds a touch of flair around the middle for a physical Dublin side. He was off the charts in the shock win over Limerick. Martin Keoghan (Kilkenny) 'Mossy' has become the totem around which Kilkenny's talented posse of forwards circulate. The Tullaroan man, after a few years of being part of the support cast, has started to rack up the numbers of a true Cats matinee idol. Managed six points in defeat as Kilkenny's season was ended by All-Ireland champions Tipperary at the penultimate stage. John McGrath (Tipperary) John McGrath scores a third goal for Tipperary. We may never have seen the likes of this.... 📺 https://t.co/ZfZ9mA9XTY 📱 https://t.co/1S2tbTA3PH 📻 https://t.co/2SRRKdgjzu pic.twitter.com/kNFBkiv2yT Noel's fourth All-Ireland medal owes much to the goalscoring prowess of his little brother who has been a man reborn this season. His two goals today bringing him to seven in the Championship in 2025. A wily, smart and skilled hurler. A joy to watch. Brian Hayes (Cork) A shoo-in for Hurler of the Year had the Rebels got the job done today, but still a season to remember for the towering St Finbarrs forward. Against Tipperary he managed a single point from play, bringing him to 5-09 in seven championship matches, but he is more than just a scorer - a playmaker, a free-winner and a bringer of chaos. The Cork attack will be built around him for years to come. ALL-IRELAND HURLING FINAL MAN OF THE MATCH Ronan Maher (Tipperary) The captain played a captain's role. Tipperary's 3-14 in the second half may grab the headlines, but what about the 0-02 recorded at the other end? The Tipperary defence, in that second half, were playing on a different level. And the tone for that ravenous, relentless performance was set by full-back Maher, who completely shut down Cork's main man Brian Hayes. Superb in the air, a hard-hitting tackler and pragmatic when he needs to be, the Thurles man makes defending an art form. SUNDAY GAME HURLER OF THE YEAR Jake Morris (Tipperary) "It was a sobering winter for us all [after] being knocked out of the championship early again. Lads had to go away and have a hard, long look in the mirror, really. It's a hard thing to do but it had to be done. "Pride was swallowed and really it was about coming back in and giving this one hell of a rattle. "We worked extremely hard as a group to give ourselves a chance of being in an All-Ireland final and it shows what you can do with a bit of hard work and determination." Jake Morris bore the brickbats of the Tipp hurling public in 2024 when things did not go well for the Premier County, so how sweet will it feel to be a two-time All-Ireland winner and be credited with being the key man for Liam Cahill's team's unlikely triumph? The Tipperary attack can be an irresistible force at its best and Morris is the man who makes it tick. His tactical awareness, his movement, his pace, his skills, his eye for a pass and his shooting ability from range, are all the qualities that make him Tipperary's main man.

Title: Cork player ratings: Shane Barrett starts strong but too many fail to reach final crescendo

Time Published: 2025-07-20T17:37:16Z
Full Content:
At fault for Tipperary’s crucial first goal when mis-controlling a shot that was going over the crossbar. Should have been more decisive under a long ball for Tipp’s second goal. Rating: 4 On a lot of ball in the first half when Cork were mostly comfortable at the back. Scored and made a point on his forays into attack. Ultimately couldn’t handle Darragh McCarthy. Rating: 5 Coped reasonably well under the dropping ball in the first half but was losing his battle with John McGrath when he picked up a second yellow for conceding a penalty. Rating: 4 Tipp were happy for O’Donoghue to be the first receiver on short puck-outs and his distribution was patchy. His least impressive game of an otherwise excellent season. Rating: 5 Fought hard as usual and kept going to the end. Held Jake Morris to a couple of points from play without negating his influence. Morris must now be favourite for Hurler of the Year. Rating: 5 Absolutely commanding in the first half, dominating in the air and on the ground, but the centre didn’t hold in the second half when Tipp started playing the ball in front of him. Rating: 6 Made a blistering start, sweeping up around the Cork half-back line and starting attacks, but couldn’t maintain that influence and faded as the game wore on. Rating: 6 After a terrific season this was his least effective performance. Made an early assist and had a couple of score involvements late in the first half but otherwise offered little in attack. Rating: 4 Was the most influential of the four centre fielders in the first half, but Cork lost a grip in the middle third in the second half. Fought hard against the tide. Finished with three points from play. Rating: 6 For a young player starting just his third championship match he had a brilliant first half, scoring three points and assisting two. Couldn’t get going after half-time and was eventually replaced. Rating: 6 Superb in the opening half, rifling three points from play, including what seemed at the time like a vital goal in first-half stoppage time. Finished with 1-4 but couldn’t influence the second half. Rating: 7 Just like last year, he followed a terrific semi-final with an ineffective performance in the final. Landed a trademark long free in the first half, but faded badly before being replaced. Rating: 4 The most effective of Cork’s inside forwards in the first half, scoring one from play and making another. Missed a free just after half-time and was replaced before the hour mark. Rating: 5 Got his only point shortly before half-time but had struggled to get his hands on the ball before that. Ironically, fluffed the only goal chance he created by making a poor handpass instead of shooting. Rating: 4 Was smothered in the air by Ronan Maher. One of his flicks from a long puck-out resulted in a first half score, and was fouled for two frees, but was essentially neutralised by Tipp. Rating: 5 Seamus Harnedy was lively as always, hitting the crossbar with a rasping shot for goal and scoring a late point. Damien Cahalane coped well as an emergency full back, apart from one ridiculous foul for charging. Rating: 5 Cork coped well with Tipp’s extra defender in the first half but when the momentum of the game shifted violently after the break they didn’t have any solutions. Too many players failed.

Title: Sea of blue and gold floods Talbot Street as Tipperary fans honour Seán Treacy ahead of All-Ireland final

There were smiles, laughter and fists held high among the Tipperary supporters following the county’s All-Ireland hurling final in Dublin’s Croke Park on Sunday. Anthony Nagle, from Clonmel but now living in Dublin, said he had “not a single complaint left” following the definitive win by the Tipperary team. “Cork didn’t expect it. They are known to be a little bit arrogant. But their game didn’t turn up today,” he said. John O’Dwyer, a brother of Ryan O’Dwyer the former player for Tipperary and Dublin, said he was delighted. “Lots of heart” was his explanation for the Tipperary win. “The team had lots of heart.” Joe Bourke, enjoying a celebratory post-match drink in the noted Tipperary people’s pub Chaplin’s on Hawkins Street, said he put the Tipperary team’s performance down to the number of young people in the squad who had “energised the whole team”. However, the Cork supporters were not so cheerful, as might be expected. “Gutted” was the response from Togher man Gavin Barrett when The Irish Times stopped him on the street. He said he felt the initially successful performance by the Cork team had little substance to it. “I felt it was nothing. Then the second half – complete collapse.” Taylor Keating, who was with him, said she too felt the Cork performance was lacking. [ Cork v Tipperary live updates: Tipperary win All-Ireland after amazing second half performanceOpens in new window ] Dermot Crowley from Douglas said of course he was “disappointed”. He said he had not bought into the pre-match “talk” that Cork would win fairly easily. “I felt everyone was a little frightened of Tipp in the background.” Earlier, Dublin’s Talbot Street had been a sea of blue and gold on Sunday morning as Tipp fans gathered for the annual commemoration of War of Independence veteran Seán Treacy in advance of the final. Hundreds gathered at the memorial for the Soloheadbeg republican who was killed in a shoot-out with Crown forces in October 1920. [ Tipperary are better than they get credit for, but Cork go into All-Ireland final as the finished articleOpens in new window ] The sea of Tipp colours was not matched elsewhere, however, as from midday, the rest of the city teemed with one colour: red. John and Mark Swann from Doneraile were with a large group of Cork supporters outside Mulligan’s pub on Poolbeg Street, and said it was clear the Rebels had come to town. They travelled to Dublin on Saturday and were not going home until Monday. The father and son team and the wider group had no doubt whatsoever that Cork would prevail in the final. “Ten points. Cork will win by 10 points,” said Mark. Also relaxed about the supremacy of the Cork team were Donal Murphy, Freddie Sweeney, Ian O’Brien, Conor Curran, Jack Hannon, Steven Davern and Gary Sweeney, as they posed for photographs and enjoyed a prematch drink before walking to Croke Park. Some 50 yards away outside Chaplin’s bar, a group of supporters were equally happy, if not as confident. Jack Keating noted the county was on the “back foot” when it came to winning the All-Ireland. “We are so far back I don’t even know what is forward any more,” he joked. Around the corner on D’Olier Street and up O’Connell Street, the scale of the number of Cork fans became apparent as a tide of red swept along. By rough estimate, the crowds of Cork supporters outnumbered the Tipperary supporters by at least 20 to one. Tourists wheeling bags looked on as fans waited, five and six deep, at traffic lights. Street vendors selling “flags, hats and ponchos” mingled with those holding signs aloft calling for “tickets needed”. Music blared from Cassidy’s and the Belvedere hotels as the sea of red – with occasional dots of blue and gold – swept by to the beat of a bodhrán and chants of “Re-bels, Re-bels”. On the corner of North Circular Road, Shay and Chloe Butler were dressed in the blue and gold Tipperary colours but were downbeat about the county’s chances. Shay, originally from Gortnahoe and now living in Dublin, said Tipperary fans seemed to accept that their team faced a difficult task in beating Cork. “It is more exciting when Dublin are playing,” said Chloe, who added that she was “always a Dub”. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Trump and the energy industry are eager to power AI with fossil fuels

Δ A nonprofit, independent media organization dedicated to telling stories of climate solutions and a just future. Δ AI is “not my thing,” President Donald Trump admitted during a speech in Pittsburgh on Tuesday. However, the president said during his remarks at the Energy and Innovation Summit, his advisers had told him just how important energy was to the future of AI. “You need double the electric of what we have right now, and maybe even more than that,” Trump said, recalling a conversation with “David”—most likely White House AI czar David Sacks, a panelist at the summit. “I said, what, are you kidding? That’s double the electric that we have. Take everything we have and double it.” At the high-profile summit on Tuesday—where, in addition to Sacks, panelists and attendees included Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, Google president and chief investment officer Ruth Porat, and ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods—companies announced $92 billion in investments across various energy and AI-related ventures. These are just the latest in recent breakneck rollouts in investment around AI and energy infrastructure. A day before the Pittsburgh meeting, Mark Zuckerberg shared on Threads that Meta would be building “titan clusters” of data centers to supercharge its AI efforts. The one closest to coming online, dubbed Prometheus, is located in Ohio and will be powered by onsite gas generation, SemiAnalysis reported last week. For an administration committed to advancing the future of fossil fuels, the location of the event was significant. Pennsylvania sits on the Marcellus and Utica shale formations, which supercharged Pennsylvania’s fracking boom in the late 2000s and early 2010s. The state is still the country’s second-most prolific natural gas producer. Pennsylvania-based natural gas had a big role at the summit: The CEO of Pittsburgh-based natural gas company EQT, Toby Rice—who dubs himself the “people’s champion of natural gas”—moderated one of the panels and sat onstage with the president during his speech. Grist thanks its sponsors. Become one. To support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How All this new demand from AI is welcome news for the natural gas industry in the US, the world’s top producer and exporter of liquefied natural gas. Global gas markets have been facing a mounting supply glut for years. Following a warm winter last year, Morgan Stanley predicted gas supply could reach “multi-decade highs” over the next few years. A jolt of new demand—like the demand represented by massive data centers—could revitalize the industry and help drive prices back up. Natural gas from Pennsylvania and the Appalachian region, in particular, has faced market challenges both from ultra-cheap natural gas from the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico as well as a lack of infrastructure to carry supply out of the region. These economic headwinds are “why the industry is doing their best to sort of create this drumbeat or this narrative around the need for AI data centers,” says Clark Williams-Derry, an energy finance analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. It appears to be working. Pipeline companies are already pitching new projects to truck gas from the northeast—responding, they say, to data center demand. The industry is finding a willing partner in the Trump administration. Since taking office, Trump has used AI as a lever to open up opportunities for fossil fuels, including a well-publicized effort to resuscitate coal in the name of more computing power. The summit, which was organized by Republican senator (and former hedge fund CEO) Dave McCormick, clearly reflected the administration’s priorities in this regard: No representatives from any wind or solar companies were present on any of the public panels. Tech companies, which have expressed an interest in using any and all cheap power available for AI and have quietly pushed back against some of the administration’s anti-renewables positions, aren’t necessarily on the same page as the Trump administration. Among the announcements made at the summit was a $3 billion investment in hydropower from Google. Grist thanks its sponsors. Become one. To support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How This demand isn’t necessarily driven by a big concern for the climate—many tech giants have walked back their climate commitments in recent years as their focus on AI has sharpened—but rather pure economics. Financial analyst Lazard said last month that installing utility-scale solar panels and batteries is still cheaper than building out natural gas plants, even without tax incentives. Gas infrastructure is also facing a global shortage that makes the timescales for setting up power generation vastly different. “The waiting list for a new turbine is five years,” Williams-Derry says. “If you want a new solar plant, you call China, you say, ‘I want more solar.’” Given the ideological split at the summit, things occasionally got a little awkward. On one panel, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, who headed up a fracking company before coming to the federal government, talked at length about how the Obama and Biden administrations were on an “energy crazy train,” scoffing at those administrations’ support for wind and solar. Speaking directly after Wright, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink admitted that solar would likely support dispatchable gas in powering AI. Incredibly, fellow panel member Woods, the ExxonMobil CEO, later paid some of the only lip service to the idea of drawing down emissions heard during the entire event. (Woods was touting the oil giant’s carbon capture and storage business.) Still, the hype train, for the most part, moved smoothly, with everyone agreeing on one thing: We’re going to need a lot of power, and soon. Blackstone CEO Jonathan Gray said that AI could help drive “40 or 50 percent more power usage over the next decade,” while Porat, of Google, mentioned some economists’ projections that AI could add $4 trillion to the US economy by 2030. It’s easy to find any variety of headlines or reports—often based on projections produced by private companies—projecting massive growth numbers for AI. “I view all of these projections with great skepticism,” says Jonathan Koomey, a computing researcher and consultant who has contributed to research around AI and power. “I don’t think anyone has any idea, even a few years hence, how much electricity data centers are gonna use.” In February, Koomey coauthored a report for the Bipartisan Policy Center cautioning that improvements in AI efficiency and other developments in the technology make data center power load hard to predict. But there’s “a bunch of self-interested actors,” Koomey says, involved in the hype cycle around AI and power, including energy executives, utilities, consultants and AI companies. Koomey remembers the last time there was a hype bubble around electricity, fossil fuels, and technology. In the late 1990s, a variety of sources, including investment banks, trade publications, and experts testifying in front of Congress began to spread hype around the growth of the internet, claiming that the internet could soon consume as much as half of US electricity. More coal-fired power, many of these sources argued, would be needed to support this massive expansion. (“Dig More Coal—The PCs Are Coming” was the headline of a 1999 Forbes article that Koomey cites as being particularly influential to shaping the hype.) The prediction never came to pass, as efficiency gains in tech helped drive down the internet’s energy needs; the initial projections were also based, Koomey says, on a variety of faulty calculations. Koomey says that he sees parallels between the late 1990s and the current craze around AI and energy. “People just need to understand the history and not fall for these self-interested narratives,” he says. There’s some signs that the AI-energy bubble may not be inflating as much as Big Tech thinks: in March, Microsoft quietly backed out of 2GW of data center leases, citing a decision to not support some training workloads from OpenAI. “It can both be true that there’s growth in electricity use and there’s a whole bunch of people hyping it way beyond what it’s likely to happen,” Koomey says.

Daily Tech News 20 July 2025 Top Story If you gaze long into an LLM, the LLM also gazes into you: Geoff Lewis is managing partner and co-founder of Bedrock Capital (no, you're thinking of Blackrock) and guided his firm to be an early investor in OpenAI. He used ChatGPT to help him in his work on a daily basis. He went stark raving mad. (Futurism) There is a website called the SCP Foundation that documents the work of a secretive organisation that finds, catalogues, and if possible imprisons various kinds of cosmic horror and more innocuous but equally strange entities. It's a work of collaborative fiction organised as a wiki, and has been running for more than 15 years. It's all online where tools like ChatGPT can scan it and incorporate it into their hallucinations, which is exactly what it fed to Geoff Lewis, providing the perfect reinforcement loop to drive him into psychosis. Which in a strange form of recursion, layering reality upon fiction, makes ChatGPT into precisely the kind of psychic terror that the SCP Foundation pretends to investigate. (Hat tip to commenter Blonde Morticia.) Tech News Are you looking to spend $900 on a replica of the Data General Dasher terminal keyboard from 1977, used as the basis for prop design in the Apple TV sci-fi series Severance? (Tom's Hardware) Nope, me neither. Are you looking to spend $1299 on a 32" 6K (6016x3384) monitor covering 98% of the DCI-P3 colour space? (Hot Hardware) If you are, the Asus ProArt PA32QCV is exactly that and costs exactly that much, or will do when it launches next month. It has two Thunderbolt 4 ports with 96W power delivery, DisplayPort, HDMI, two 2W speakers with a headphone jack, and a built-in USB hub with KVM support. It only offers a 60Hz refresh rate, so definitely more suitable to professional artists than competitive gamers. I want one. But since I run a triple-monitor setup, that could get kind of expensive. Speaking of expensive, TSMC has leased land in Central Taiwan Science Park to construct four new 1.4nm fabs. (Taipei Times) No numbers attached, but expect it to cost more than three 6K monitors. The company also plans to build eleven wafer manufacturing plants (creating silicon wafers to turn into chips) and four packaging facilities (where the bare slivers of silicon are packaged into the products that other companies package into the boards that still other companies package into consumer products). Intel is laying off 5500 employees in Oregon, California, and Arizona. (WCCFTech) Assuming these are new layoffs, this brings the total job losses at the company to over 20,000 in the past year. OEM laptop maker Sixunited has announced a burger with the lot. (Notebook Check) The company's new XN77-160M-CS - forgive them, this is not a retail brand - uses AMD's Strix Halo CPU, which has integrated graphics on par with Nvidia's laptop 4070 model, paired with up to 128GB of RAM. The RAM is soldered due to timing constraints of the 256-bit bus - Framework tried modular RAM on this processor but couldn't make it work reliably at the required speeds - but it does have two M.2 slots. Plus a 2560x1600 165Hz display covering 100% of sRGB, two Thunderbolt 4 ports, two regular USB ports, wired Ethernet (though only gigabit), HDMI, what looks like a full-size SD card slot, a headphone jack, a barrel jack power connector, and the Four Essential Keys all in their rightful place. No pricing specified since this will be sold to other companies who will then market it to the public. Musical Interlude Disclaimer: Ask the children. The children have many dollars.

What are *you* up to this fine morning? Me? Uh . . . not much. Still hurting a bit from the surgery of last Monday, though I move around well and can drive to the grocery. There are a few things I *need* to get today; the big shop can come tomorrow. The Killer Kittenz From Outer Space are galloping around after breakfast, Dagny with her Cat Dancer wire toy and Stirling leaping around with her. I recommend this toy to any cat people. It's simple, and since the curved wire wiggles on its own when they play with it, it'll keep them entertained/exercised for hours.

Get those skeeters both in the water and on the fly. And they don't bother humans. Posted by: RickZ at July 20, 2025 *** We used to have those in the patio of our French Quarter apartment when I was a kid, along with not a few mosquitoes. Mom called the dragonflies "mosquito hawks." People don't believe me when I say we used to have fireflies too. My brother and I would trap them in a Tang jar of an evening with holes poked in the lid, and watch them flick their lights on and off. Then we'd open the jar and let them go. Posted by: Wolfus Aurelius, Dreaming of Elsewhere at July 20, 2025 06:27 AM (omVj0) 47 So family and I went to a lovely art museum in New Castle, Delaware - called "Delaware Art Museum"" not overwhelmingly large and with a terrific collection of of beautiful Pre- Raphaelite painting. There was some modern arts and prints but I didn't see those, and some great illustrations by Howard Pyle. Unfortunately, there was the usual left wing bias in some of the commentary. There was a picture by Howard Pyle with a strong tall, man challenging a robber or criminal who was trying to assault or rob a woman. Because it's from the early 1900's we need to be told that the white man is seen as courageous and strong and the woman is in a subservient position. Oh, gee, because white men shouldn't be courageous and she should have whipped Led out her karate moves and defeated the robber. They got me on tape I'm sure saying that and rolling my eyes But I enjoyed it anyway and I liked that one of the pre-Raphaelites was a very devout Christian who had wanted to illustrate all of the scenes in the Bible. New Castle DEi has an old section Which dates from the late 1600s with lovely homes from the 1700's and 1800's with some cobblestone streets.

Some people say "I've just seen the biggest mosquito ever" and it was probably a mosquito hawk. My new neighbors have three bat houses on poles in their BY.

Where I live now, no spots of light in the back yard. I seldom watched TV at that age, and was outdoors building my backyard construction site with my little plastic trucks and cars. Mother read a lot and dad played poker or pool in a hidden backroom of a bar/restaurant. Don't think they ever got raided and they were hurting nobody.

This has been by far the biggest story in the media of the last week. You can try to avoid it, but it just keeps popping up everywhere. It is not left or right it has been on all the news sites. I keep lowering my expectations about our culture, but I don’t do it quickly enough. Posted by: Quint at July 20, 2025 07:09 AM (haE0k) 77 I had a similar experience with the 2002 Ford Explorer. If the cam position sensor gets wet, it kills the vehicle until it is replaced. It is on the underside of the engine compartment and the enclosure that is supposed to keep it dry is very easy for a mechanic to get wrong. I was twice stranded on a rainy. One of these times was on an offramp from the 210 Freeway in Pasadena just in time for rush hour. I later did a search and found many forum entries discussing the problem, with several posters saying they always kept a spare as part of an emergency kit in the Explorer.

Title: Mike Rowe warns of massive trade-job vacancies: 'AI is coming for the coders'

Skip to comments. Posted on 07/19/2025 10:19:32 AM PDT by Twotone Blue-collar hero and former host of "Dirty Jobs" Mike Rowe says claims of a massive deficit of trades workers in the United States are not hyperbole. Rowe spoke at the Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit, where he sounded the alarm on a serious lack of young people going into the trades. Providing stories from employers, politicians, and even the military, Rowe stressed the need to move away from computer programming and coding in favor of tougher, more traditional career paths. "We've been telling kids for 15 years to learn to code," Rowe told an audience at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. He then delivered a stark warning to those who may have followed Joe Biden's infamous "learn to code" advice in 2019. "Well, AI is coming for the coders," Rowe remarked. From there, the 63-year-old dropped some industry knowledge, detailing that the demand for tradespeople was not going away any time soon: "[AI is] not coming for the welders, the plumbers, the steamfitters, the pipe fitters, the HVAC. They're not coming for the electricians." Adopting a more serious tone, Rowe leaned in to the audience to deliver the jaw-dropping numbers of exactly how many trade jobs remain vacant in the United States. Recalling his time at the Aspen Ideas Festival in late June, Rowe said billionaire investor and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told him the U.S. needs "500,000 electricians in the next couple of years — not hyperbole." "This is me being the alarmist again," Rowe continued, now tapping into America's military industrial needs. "The BlueForge Alliance, who oversees our maritime industrial base — that's 15,000 individual companies who are collectively charged with building and delivering three nuclear-powered subs to the Navy every year for 10 years." Rowe explained that the head of the alliance called him and said, "We're having a hell of a time finding tradespeople. Can you help?" Rowe replied, "I don't know, man, it's pretty skinny out there. How many do you need?" The man indicated to Rowe that the industry needed 140,000 people over the next seven years. "They need 80 to 90 thousand right now," Rowe emphasized. "These are for our submarines, folks. [If] things go hypersonic — a little sideways with China, Taiwan — our aircraft carriers are no longer the point of the spear. They're vulnerable." Rowe added, "Our submarines matter, and these guys have a pinch point because they can't find welders and electricians to get them built." The Trump administration drastically increased naval production in April 2025 through an executive order that placed at least $40 billion per year into shipbuilding efforts for the next 30 years. With fewer than 300 battle force ships in the U.S. Navy currently, according to the Military Times, the president set a goal for a 381-ship fleet. To that end, the Discovery Channel host said he is consistently getting calls from tradespeople, companies, and even governors, who ask him a simple question. "Where are they?" they ask Rowe, referring to tradespeople. "They've said, 'We've looked everywhere.'" Rowe revealed his response to industry leaders: "I know where they are. They're in the eighth grade." The trades advocate stressed that a "clear and present freakout" was happening under the surface in America in the automotive and energy industries, suggesting that children need to be encouraged to go into these fields. "The automotive industry needs 80,000 collision repair and technicians," he explained. "Energy, I don't even know what the number is — I hear 300,000; I hear 500,000." The latter is likely to do with not only nuclear-powered subs but also small modular reactors that are popping up across the United States to supply the growing power demand from data centers, new and old. Several large companies like Amazon and Microsoft are building new, massive data centers and campuses to house data and AI machine-learning systems. These new locations require so much power that they have put stress on existing power grids, necessitating their own energy sources.

The people who stayed home using their computers got paid more, but the people who were out there whether they were working in stores, delivering goods, repairing power lines, or repairing cars, were the ones who were essential. Many of those sitting at home will be replaced by AI next time. 3 posted on 07/19/2025 10:28:21 AM PDT by Freee-dame [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: mewzilla And a neat FR thread from a few days ago...Mike Rowe’s Mother Had an Important Warning for Him Before He Met Trump 4 posted on 07/19/2025 10:29:20 AM PDT by mewzilla (Swing away, Mr. President, swing away!)

I guess that makes him an early millennial. I told him that so long as he was willing to work he would probably never have to worry about having a job for the rest of his life. So far I have been right. There was no way the sparse generations since X would ever replace the Boomers. I had an X helper here on the farm but had to fire him and wish it had not been so but I could not tolerate the risk of his having returned to old bad habits. I have not looked very hard to find a replacement but when I do I find the field is all but vacant for candidates. My only viable responses to the loss of help are to: do less, work smarter, mechanize or quit. I have not quit yet. Covid was the straw that broke the camel’s back all at once instead of over a period of a few more years when it came to the “great replacement”. We mid to late Boomers will be taken care of by third world recruits or robots or not at all. The time for that is at hand and the next 10 years for us look bleak if we can’t manage on our own. This is long but at least some of it is worth the watch if you don’t know the story of the demographics and how seriously deficient the numbers of replacements are. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w05QgHwq8Ig&t=590s 7 posted on 07/19/2025 10:42:28 AM PDT by Sequoyah101 [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Twotone It seems to me that a lot of people would like these jobs - not everyone is suited to sitting at a desk all day. The real problem is the false stigma that’s been created around them, as though those who do them aren’t ‘smart’ enough to do other types of work. Many of the trades involve high skill levels and require a lot of brain power. 8 posted on 07/19/2025 10:43:50 AM PDT by Jamestown1630 ("A Republic, if you can keep it.") [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Twotone The numbers have probably changed since I heard Mike mention them a couple of years ago .... trades people are retiring & for every 5 that retire, there is only one to replace them. If people want to WORK, there are good jobs & good money out there. Our HVAC guy was making 80-90k a year with experience. Many of the trades have programs where you go to school (usually a community college) & get your certificate - they pay for it & you work for them for 2 years (or whatever their terms are). No student debt, no graduating an expensive 4 year degree program in some non-technical field only to find it might qualify you to work at Starbucks/s. 9 posted on 07/19/2025 10:49:04 AM PDT by Qiviut (Imagine waking up in the morning & only having the things you thanked God for yesterday.

He cites nuclear submarine builders having difficulty finding employees. Those employers can hire woke Didn't Earn It (DEI) employees and send them through regular DEI training to remind them of how bad white males are. Get women to do it. They're boss babes. They don't need no man. They can smash the "patriarchy". Mike went to school for a white-collar Communications degree and works in television. It's not about "dirty jobs", it's about jobs that have little value outside of a narrow field. Mike can go interview all those fathers and grandfathers who used to do those jobs and got laid off in the 1970s and 1980s, and ask them why they told their sons and daughters to go in different industries. You can go to yard sales and flea markets all over the country and buy tools that haven't been used in decades. There are a lot of people who aren't going to learn all those skills that don't translate into anything once they get downsized - and they will get downsized. They're asking themselves, "What's in it for me? Because if it's just a paycheck, I'll find a different way - maybe as an 'influencer' like Mike Rowe did." 12 posted on 07/19/2025 10:55:21 AM PDT by T.B.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Rowe spoke at the Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit, where he sounded the alarm on a serious lack of young people going into the trades. Providing stories from employers, politicians, and even the military, Rowe stressed the need to move away from computer programming and coding in favor of tougher, more traditional career paths. "We've been telling kids for 15 years to learn to code," Rowe told an audience at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. He then delivered a stark warning to those who may have followed Joe Biden's infamous "learn to code" advice in 2019. "Well, AI is coming for the coders," Rowe remarked. From there, the 63-year-old dropped some industry knowledge, detailing that the demand for tradespeople was not going away any time soon: "[AI is] not coming for the welders, the plumbers, the steamfitters, the pipe fitters, the HVAC. They're not coming for the electricians." Adopting a more serious tone, Rowe leaned in to the audience to deliver the jaw-dropping numbers of exactly how many trade jobs remain vacant in the United States. Recalling his time at the Aspen Ideas Festival in late June, Rowe said billionaire investor and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told him the U.S. needs "500,000 electricians in the next couple of years — not hyperbole." "This is me being the alarmist again," Rowe continued, now tapping into America's military industrial needs. "The BlueForge Alliance, who oversees our maritime industrial base — that's 15,000 individual companies who are collectively charged with building and delivering three nuclear-powered subs to the Navy every year for 10 years." Rowe explained that the head of the alliance called him and said, "We're having a hell of a time finding tradespeople. Can you help?" Rowe replied, "I don't know, man, it's pretty skinny out there. How many do you need?" The man indicated to Rowe that the industry needed 140,000 people over the next seven years. "They need 80 to 90 thousand right now," Rowe emphasized. "These are for our submarines, folks. [If] things go hypersonic — a little sideways with China, Taiwan — our aircraft carriers are no longer the point of the spear. They're vulnerable." Rowe added, "Our submarines matter, and these guys have a pinch point because they can't find welders and electricians to get them built." The Trump administration drastically increased naval production in April 2025 through an executive order that placed at least $40 billion per year into shipbuilding efforts for the next 30 years. With fewer than 300 battle force ships in the U.S. Navy currently, according to the Military Times, the president set a goal for a 381-ship fleet. To that end, the Discovery Channel host said he is consistently getting calls from tradespeople, companies, and even governors, who ask him a simple question. "Where are they?" they ask Rowe, referring to tradespeople. "They've said, 'We've looked everywhere.'" Rowe revealed his response to industry leaders: "I know where they are. They're in the eighth grade." The trades advocate stressed that a "clear and present freakout" was happening under the surface in America in the automotive and energy industries, suggesting that children need to be encouraged to go into these fields. "The automotive industry needs 80,000 collision repair and technicians," he explained. "Energy, I don't even know what the number is — I hear 300,000; I hear 500,000." The latter is likely to do with not only nuclear-powered subs but also small modular reactors that are popping up across the United States to supply the growing power demand from data centers, new and old. Several large companies like Amazon and Microsoft are building new, massive data centers and campuses to house data and AI machine-learning systems. These new locations require so much power that they have put stress on existing power grids, necessitating their own energy sources.

He then delivered a stark warning to those who may have followed Joe Biden's infamous "learn to code" advice in 2019. "Well, AI is coming for the coders," Rowe remarked. From there, the 63-year-old dropped some industry knowledge, detailing that the demand for tradespeople was not going away any time soon: "[AI is] not coming for the welders, the plumbers, the steamfitters, the pipe fitters, the HVAC. They're not coming for the electricians." Adopting a more serious tone, Rowe leaned in to the audience to deliver the jaw-dropping numbers of exactly how many trade jobs remain vacant in the United States. Recalling his time at the Aspen Ideas Festival in late June, Rowe said billionaire investor and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told him the U.S. needs "500,000 electricians in the next couple of years — not hyperbole." "This is me being the alarmist again," Rowe continued, now tapping into America's military industrial needs. "The BlueForge Alliance, who oversees our maritime industrial base — that's 15,000 individual companies who are collectively charged with building and delivering three nuclear-powered subs to the Navy every year for 10 years." Rowe explained that the head of the alliance called him and said, "We're having a hell of a time finding tradespeople. Can you help?" Rowe replied, "I don't know, man, it's pretty skinny out there. How many do you need?" The man indicated to Rowe that the industry needed 140,000 people over the next seven years. "They need 80 to 90 thousand right now," Rowe emphasized. "These are for our submarines, folks. [If] things go hypersonic — a little sideways with China, Taiwan — our aircraft carriers are no longer the point of the spear. They're vulnerable." Rowe added, "Our submarines matter, and these guys have a pinch point because they can't find welders and electricians to get them built." The Trump administration drastically increased naval production in April 2025 through an executive order that placed at least $40 billion per year into shipbuilding efforts for the next 30 years. With fewer than 300 battle force ships in the U.S. Navy currently, according to the Military Times, the president set a goal for a 381-ship fleet. To that end, the Discovery Channel host said he is consistently getting calls from tradespeople, companies, and even governors, who ask him a simple question. "Where are they?" they ask Rowe, referring to tradespeople. "They've said, 'We've looked everywhere.'" Rowe revealed his response to industry leaders: "I know where they are. They're in the eighth grade." The trades advocate stressed that a "clear and present freakout" was happening under the surface in America in the automotive and energy industries, suggesting that children need to be encouraged to go into these fields. "The automotive industry needs 80,000 collision repair and technicians," he explained. "Energy, I don't even know what the number is — I hear 300,000; I hear 500,000." The latter is likely to do with not only nuclear-powered subs but also small modular reactors that are popping up across the United States to supply the growing power demand from data centers, new and old. Several large companies like Amazon and Microsoft are building new, massive data centers and campuses to house data and AI machine-learning systems. These new locations require so much power that they have put stress on existing power grids, necessitating their own energy sources.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson From there, the 63-year-old dropped some industry knowledge, detailing that the demand for tradespeople was not going away any time soon: "[AI is] not coming for the welders, the plumbers, the steamfitters, the pipe fitters, the HVAC. They're not coming for the electricians." Adopting a more serious tone, Rowe leaned in to the audience to deliver the jaw-dropping numbers of exactly how many trade jobs remain vacant in the United States. Recalling his time at the Aspen Ideas Festival in late June, Rowe said billionaire investor and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told him the U.S. needs "500,000 electricians in the next couple of years — not hyperbole." "This is me being the alarmist again," Rowe continued, now tapping into America's military industrial needs. "The BlueForge Alliance, who oversees our maritime industrial base — that's 15,000 individual companies who are collectively charged with building and delivering three nuclear-powered subs to the Navy every year for 10 years." Rowe explained that the head of the alliance called him and said, "We're having a hell of a time finding tradespeople. Can you help?" Rowe replied, "I don't know, man, it's pretty skinny out there. How many do you need?" The man indicated to Rowe that the industry needed 140,000 people over the next seven years. "They need 80 to 90 thousand right now," Rowe emphasized. "These are for our submarines, folks. [If] things go hypersonic — a little sideways with China, Taiwan — our aircraft carriers are no longer the point of the spear. They're vulnerable." Rowe added, "Our submarines matter, and these guys have a pinch point because they can't find welders and electricians to get them built." The Trump administration drastically increased naval production in April 2025 through an executive order that placed at least $40 billion per year into shipbuilding efforts for the next 30 years. With fewer than 300 battle force ships in the U.S. Navy currently, according to the Military Times, the president set a goal for a 381-ship fleet. To that end, the Discovery Channel host said he is consistently getting calls from tradespeople, companies, and even governors, who ask him a simple question. "Where are they?" they ask Rowe, referring to tradespeople. "They've said, 'We've looked everywhere.'" Rowe revealed his response to industry leaders: "I know where they are. They're in the eighth grade." The trades advocate stressed that a "clear and present freakout" was happening under the surface in America in the automotive and energy industries, suggesting that children need to be encouraged to go into these fields. "The automotive industry needs 80,000 collision repair and technicians," he explained. "Energy, I don't even know what the number is — I hear 300,000; I hear 500,000." The latter is likely to do with not only nuclear-powered subs but also small modular reactors that are popping up across the United States to supply the growing power demand from data centers, new and old. Several large companies like Amazon and Microsoft are building new, massive data centers and campuses to house data and AI machine-learning systems. These new locations require so much power that they have put stress on existing power grids, necessitating their own energy sources.

With fewer than 300 battle force ships in the U.S. Navy currently, according to the Military Times, the president set a goal for a 381-ship fleet. To that end, the Discovery Channel host said he is consistently getting calls from tradespeople, companies, and even governors, who ask him a simple question. "Where are they?" they ask Rowe, referring to tradespeople. "They've said, 'We've looked everywhere.'" Rowe revealed his response to industry leaders: "I know where they are. They're in the eighth grade." The trades advocate stressed that a "clear and present freakout" was happening under the surface in America in the automotive and energy industries, suggesting that children need to be encouraged to go into these fields. "The automotive industry needs 80,000 collision repair and technicians," he explained. "Energy, I don't even know what the number is — I hear 300,000; I hear 500,000." The latter is likely to do with not only nuclear-powered subs but also small modular reactors that are popping up across the United States to supply the growing power demand from data centers, new and old. Several large companies like Amazon and Microsoft are building new, massive data centers and campuses to house data and AI machine-learning systems. These new locations require so much power that they have put stress on existing power grids, necessitating their own energy sources.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Rowe explained that the head of the alliance called him and said, "We're having a hell of a time finding tradespeople. Can you help?" Rowe replied, "I don't know, man, it's pretty skinny out there. How many do you need?" The man indicated to Rowe that the industry needed 140,000 people over the next seven years. "They need 80 to 90 thousand right now," Rowe emphasized. "These are for our submarines, folks. [If] things go hypersonic — a little sideways with China, Taiwan — our aircraft carriers are no longer the point of the spear. They're vulnerable." Rowe added, "Our submarines matter, and these guys have a pinch point because they can't find welders and electricians to get them built." The Trump administration drastically increased naval production in April 2025 through an executive order that placed at least $40 billion per year into shipbuilding efforts for the next 30 years. With fewer than 300 battle force ships in the U.S. Navy currently, according to the Military Times, the president set a goal for a 381-ship fleet. To that end, the Discovery Channel host said he is consistently getting calls from tradespeople, companies, and even governors, who ask him a simple question. "Where are they?" they ask Rowe, referring to tradespeople. "They've said, 'We've looked everywhere.'" Rowe revealed his response to industry leaders: "I know where they are. They're in the eighth grade." The trades advocate stressed that a "clear and present freakout" was happening under the surface in America in the automotive and energy industries, suggesting that children need to be encouraged to go into these fields. "The automotive industry needs 80,000 collision repair and technicians," he explained. "Energy, I don't even know what the number is — I hear 300,000; I hear 500,000." The latter is likely to do with not only nuclear-powered subs but also small modular reactors that are popping up across the United States to supply the growing power demand from data centers, new and old. Several large companies like Amazon and Microsoft are building new, massive data centers and campuses to house data and AI machine-learning systems. These new locations require so much power that they have put stress on existing power grids, necessitating their own energy sources.

The people who stayed home using their computers got paid more, but the people who were out there whether they were working in stores, delivering goods, repairing power lines, or repairing cars, were the ones who were essential. Many of those sitting at home will be replaced by AI next time. That's a very simplistic and flawed view. The people who stayed at home using their computers: - planned and forecasted what goods to buy, where to source them, negotiated contracts, etc. -determined what goods to deliver as well as when and where to deliver them - funded, updated, and tracked vehicle production and servicing schedules -determined electricity demands based on new construction as well as infrastructure changes -etc. etc. The people working in stores, delivering goods, repairing power lines, or repairing cars benefited from all that. The cost savings to companies discontinuing leases of offices, as well as being able to hire talent from farther away, aided all stakeholders. Remote work is nothing new. For example, Chrysler opened the Chrysler building in 1930 in Manhattan, New York but never built automobiles in New York City. 20 posted on 07/19/2025 11:15:35 AM PDT by T.B.

"They need 80 to 90 thousand right now," Rowe emphasized. "These are for our submarines, folks. [If] things go hypersonic — a little sideways with China, Taiwan — our aircraft carriers are no longer the point of the spear. They're vulnerable." Rowe added, "Our submarines matter, and these guys have a pinch point because they can't find welders and electricians to get them built." The Trump administration drastically increased naval production in April 2025 through an executive order that placed at least $40 billion per year into shipbuilding efforts for the next 30 years. With fewer than 300 battle force ships in the U.S. Navy currently, according to the Military Times, the president set a goal for a 381-ship fleet. To that end, the Discovery Channel host said he is consistently getting calls from tradespeople, companies, and even governors, who ask him a simple question. "Where are they?" they ask Rowe, referring to tradespeople. "They've said, 'We've looked everywhere.'" Rowe revealed his response to industry leaders: "I know where they are. They're in the eighth grade." The trades advocate stressed that a "clear and present freakout" was happening under the surface in America in the automotive and energy industries, suggesting that children need to be encouraged to go into these fields. "The automotive industry needs 80,000 collision repair and technicians," he explained. "Energy, I don't even know what the number is — I hear 300,000; I hear 500,000." The latter is likely to do with not only nuclear-powered subs but also small modular reactors that are popping up across the United States to supply the growing power demand from data centers, new and old. Several large companies like Amazon and Microsoft are building new, massive data centers and campuses to house data and AI machine-learning systems. These new locations require so much power that they have put stress on existing power grids, necessitating their own energy sources.

The Trump administration drastically increased naval production in April 2025 through an executive order that placed at least $40 billion per year into shipbuilding efforts for the next 30 years. With fewer than 300 battle force ships in the U.S. Navy currently, according to the Military Times, the president set a goal for a 381-ship fleet. To that end, the Discovery Channel host said he is consistently getting calls from tradespeople, companies, and even governors, who ask him a simple question. "Where are they?" they ask Rowe, referring to tradespeople. "They've said, 'We've looked everywhere.'" Rowe revealed his response to industry leaders: "I know where they are. They're in the eighth grade." The trades advocate stressed that a "clear and present freakout" was happening under the surface in America in the automotive and energy industries, suggesting that children need to be encouraged to go into these fields. "The automotive industry needs 80,000 collision repair and technicians," he explained. "Energy, I don't even know what the number is — I hear 300,000; I hear 500,000." The latter is likely to do with not only nuclear-powered subs but also small modular reactors that are popping up across the United States to supply the growing power demand from data centers, new and old. Several large companies like Amazon and Microsoft are building new, massive data centers and campuses to house data and AI machine-learning systems. These new locations require so much power that they have put stress on existing power grids, necessitating their own energy sources.

"Where are they?" they ask Rowe, referring to tradespeople. "They've said, 'We've looked everywhere.'" Rowe revealed his response to industry leaders: "I know where they are. They're in the eighth grade." The trades advocate stressed that a "clear and present freakout" was happening under the surface in America in the automotive and energy industries, suggesting that children need to be encouraged to go into these fields. "The automotive industry needs 80,000 collision repair and technicians," he explained. "Energy, I don't even know what the number is — I hear 300,000; I hear 500,000." The latter is likely to do with not only nuclear-powered subs but also small modular reactors that are popping up across the United States to supply the growing power demand from data centers, new and old. Several large companies like Amazon and Microsoft are building new, massive data centers and campuses to house data and AI machine-learning systems. These new locations require so much power that they have put stress on existing power grids, necessitating their own energy sources.

It's not about "dirty jobs", it's about jobs that have little value outside of a narrow field. Mike can go interview all those fathers and grandfathers who used to do those jobs and got laid off in the 1970s and 1980s, and ask them why they told their sons and daughters to go in different industries. You can go to yard sales and flea markets all over the country and buy tools that haven't been used in decades. There are a lot of people who aren't going to learn all those skills that don't translate into anything once they get downsized - and they will get downsized.

Many of those sitting at home will be replaced by AI next time. That's a very simplistic and flawed view. The people who stayed at home using their computers: - planned and forecasted what goods to buy, where to source them, negotiated contracts, etc. -determined what goods to deliver as well as when and where to deliver them - funded, updated, and tracked vehicle production and servicing schedules -determined electricity demands based on new construction as well as infrastructure changes -etc. etc. The people working in stores, delivering goods, repairing power lines, or repairing cars benefited from all that. The cost savings to companies discontinuing leases of offices, as well as being able to hire talent from farther away, aided all stakeholders. Remote work is nothing new. For example, Chrysler opened the Chrysler building in 1930 in Manhattan, New York but never built automobiles in New York City. 20 posted on 07/19/2025 11:15:35 AM PDT by T.B.

They're in the eighth grade." The trades advocate stressed that a "clear and present freakout" was happening under the surface in America in the automotive and energy industries, suggesting that children need to be encouraged to go into these fields. "The automotive industry needs 80,000 collision repair and technicians," he explained. "Energy, I don't even know what the number is — I hear 300,000; I hear 500,000." The latter is likely to do with not only nuclear-powered subs but also small modular reactors that are popping up across the United States to supply the growing power demand from data centers, new and old. Several large companies like Amazon and Microsoft are building new, massive data centers and campuses to house data and AI machine-learning systems. These new locations require so much power that they have put stress on existing power grids, necessitating their own energy sources.

Love his mom, she’s great. and yet employers, including under government contracts, insist they can pay them Starbucks wages. “AI please unclog my toilet”. A lot of tradespeople are making very good salaries, and at a relatively young age. This is one of the things Rowe points out in his talks on the subject. I am being glib, but for quite some time, my position has been: Dumb kids go to college. Smart kids end their schooling by age 18 and just start working. We have FReepers bragging about working at home. If that's the case, it'll be real easy to replace them as soon as the technology is available. Not all jobs that can be done from home are easily replaceable by AI. (Many jobs can’t be done from home; but some are done perfectly well from home. I sometimes think there’s a little jealousy on the part of people here who can’t work from home.) That's a very simplistic and flawed view. The people who stayed at home using their computers: - planned and forecasted what goods to buy, where to source them, negotiated contracts, etc. -determined what goods to deliver as well as when and where to deliver them - funded, updated, and tracked vehicle production and servicing schedules -determined electricity demands based on new construction as well as infrastructure changes -etc. etc. The people working in stores, delivering goods, repairing power lines, or repairing cars benefited from all that. The cost savings to companies discontinuing leases of offices, as well as being able to hire talent from farther away, aided all stakeholders. Remote work is nothing new. For example, Chrysler opened the Chrysler building in 1930 in Manhattan, New York but never built automobiles in New York City.

Title: These 5 S&P 500 Stocks Show New Highs On Declining Relative Strength

ByJohn Navin ByJohn Navin, Contributor. S&P 500, Blackrock The S&P 500 on Friday hit another new high – it was brief as sellers showed up and the index closed lower by .01%. July has been a month of new highs. It’s also been a month of a declining relative strength indicator. This negative divergence between price and a key indicator might be a problem. The RSI, as it’s known to price chart analysts, is a momentum oscillator. Developed by technical analyst J. Welles Wilder, Junior in the 70s, his work on the subject was first published in the book “New Concepts In Technical Trading Systems.” Forbes in 1980 called him “the premier technical trader publishing his work today.” The issue is not just with the S&P 500. Big, well-known names within the index are also showing weakening relative strength per Wilder’s oscillator. S&P 500: S&P 500 daily price chart, 7 19 25. The red-dotted lines show the negative divergence between the direction of price and the direction of the RSI momentum oscillator. Blackrock: Blackrock daily price chart, 7 19 25. The big asset management firm hit a new high Friday and the relative strength indicator failed to confirm the move by coming in lower than it’s earlier July reading. The stock retreated from the higher price high during the session and closed lower by .16%. Blackrock is market capitalized at $170.97 billion. Genius Sports Limited: Genius Sports Limited daily price chart, 7 19 25. The price just hit a new high. The relative strength indicator peaked in November 2024 and did not accompany the stock on to a higher high on Friday. You can see how the 50-day moving average no longer trends upward. Genius Sports Limited has a market cap of $2.89 billion and it’s a member of the Russell 2000 small caps ETF. MMM: MMM daily price chart, 7 19 25. The relative strength indicator peaked in January and is now lower even as the stock’s price is hitting a new high. Friday’s volume is extraordinary. The candlestick is a bearish engulfing: the high is higher than the previous session and the low is lower than the previous session. MMM has a market cap of $82.47 billion. Raytheon Technologies: Raytheon Technologies daily price chart, 7 19 25. The aerospace and defense company with a market cap of $202 billion has a negative divergence on its daily price chart. The stock just hit a new high and, at the same time, the relative strength indicator could not make it above its mid-June reading. Note that July volume levels are subdued compared to earlier months. Charles Schwab: Charles Schwab daily price chart, 7 19 25. The RSI peak came in mid-May and the measure is now lower as the stock itself makes a new high on decent buying volume. Schwab remains in an uptrend as indicated by the direction of the 50-day and the 200-day moving averages. Market cap for the capital markets firm is $174 billion. The RSI is only one indicator of momentum and should be seen in the context of other price indicators. Stats courtesy of FinViz.com. Charts courtesy of Stockcharts.com.

Title: For-Profit Hospital Chain Reportedly Left Patient Lying in Pool of His Own Blood
URL: https://futurism.com/neoscope/for-profit-hospital-negligence
Time Published: 2025-07-19T14:30:41Z
Full Content:
For-profit rehabilitation hospitals are booming in the United States, but their rapid growth is leaving patient safety far behind. The US post-acute care industry, which deals with rehab and long-term care facilities, was worth an estimated $483 billion in 2024, and is expected to grow to over $785 billion by 2034. On paper, it's easy to assume all that business potential would translate to quality care. Unfortunately, for thousands of patients across the country, that couldn’t be further from the truth, as Encompass Health Corporation — the McDonald's of post-acute care, basically — makes clear. Bombshell reporting by the New York Times this week uncovered a horrifying track record by Encompass and other for-profit rehab outfits. Though negligence in rehab facilities might not seem as overtly dangerous as it is in generic hospital settings, it often leads to injuries, unplanned readmissions to general hospitals, and even death. At the Encompass facility in Jackson, Tennessee, for example, a 68-year-old patient was found lying in a pool of his own blood. Per the NYT, a pressure- and motion-triggered alarm meant to alert nurses if he left his bed had been turned off prior to the gruesome discovery. A patient in Morgantown, West Virginia, died a similarly preventable death, after a fall off the bed gave her a "huge gash" on her forehead. There, too, the hospital chain's alarms failed to notify staff in time. "We are having a lot of problems with the bed alarms," a nurse technician told police inspectors after the woman's death, according to an inspection report obtained by the NYT. Another incident in South Dakota led to the death of a 73-year-old man when a nurse administered the wrong drug. That was just one of 26 adverse drug events the Encompass site was responsible for over the span of just six months. Per the NYT, Encompass owns 168 hospitals, and was responsible for nearly 250,000 patients in 2024. In 2023, Encompass helped flip the rehabilitation sector from a mostly non-profit space to a predominantly profit-seeking one. Though non-profit rehab is its own kind of nightmare, particularly for low-income or "charity care" patients, this pivot to for-profit models has come with a notable increase in unplanned readmissions to general hospitals. Unlike nursing homes and skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), these types of errors in post-acute care aren't explicitly disclosed to Medicare recipients, elderly and disabled patients who are at heightened risk for medical neglect. Nor are ownership details, such as the involvement of private equity firms or real estate investment trusts — profit-seeking groups whose participation in the medical field leads to worse outcomes in patient care. That's not to say Medicare doesn't keep tabs on rehab facilities, however. As the NYT notes, out of the 41 inpatient rehab sites Medicare judged to have "statistically significantly worse rates of potentially preventable readmissions," 34 were owned and operated by Encompass. Though Encompass has toyed around with private equity spinoffs in the past, its main overlords are institutional investors — professional investment fund managers — such as Vanguard Group, whose fund Vanguard Health was ordered to pay $18 million in claims related to "grossly substandard nursing home services," and Blackrock, whose healthcare dealings have been mired in controversy. Speaking to the NYT, executive vice president and general counsel for Encompass, Patrick Darby, called Medicare's readmission ratings a "crude scoring measure." He added that health inspection violations are "rare occurrences" that "do not support an inference of widespread quality concerns." Whether this is empirically true or not remains to be seen, as the rapidly changing corporate rehab landscape demands further study. Still, it's hard to imagine the families of patients who died under Encompass's care share the executive's attitude.

Further, amid tariff wars while there is broad uncertainty including for India, on a relative basis India is being looked upon favourably, as global corporations look for alternative supply chains. One important source to distil their India plans is from their quarterly earnings calls. With the June quarter earnings season just about gathering momentum, we will bring to you what CXOs of global corporations are saying about India and their perspectives and plans during this earnings season in this column.

Title: Bitcoin Is Lost In Washington, and Nobody Is Looking for It

Bitcoin may be the most famous cryptocurrency on the planet, but in Washington, itâs suddenly the ghost at the party. This week, lawmakers passed the GENIUS Act, the first-ever U.S. law focused entirely on cryptocurrency. It sets clear federal rules for stablecoins, the digital tokens pegged to the U.S. dollar and used for instant payments. For the first time, crypto has a legal foundation in America. But hereâs the twist: the bill doesnât mention Bitcoin. And that silence speaks volumes. From Spotlight to Sideline For more than a decade, Bitcoin dominated every conversation about crypto. It was the revolution, the protest, the gold 2.0. Politicians warned about it, billionaires backed it, and banks feared it. Now? The U.S. government just passed the most important crypto law in history, and it didnât include Bitcoin at all. Why? Because Bitcoin doesnât fit the Washington agenda anymore. Stablecoins are the hot new thing in the halls of Congress. Theyâre pegged to the dollar, designed for payments, and (at least now) tightly regulated. Theyâre the kind of crypto lawmakers can get behind: useful, tame, and trackable. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is messy. Itâs volatile, anonymous, and built to operate outside the financial system. It doesnât want approval. It doesnât ask for permission. And that makes it a problem for lawmakers trying to modernize finance without surrendering control. Even as Wall Street piles into Bitcoin ETFs and companies like BlackRock embrace it as a long-term asset, D.C. remains silent. Bitcoin is being treated like a relic of cryptoâs rebellious past, not part of its regulated future. A Shift in Crypto Power The passage of the GENIUS Act is a political pivot. Stablecoins now have rules, protections, and the federal governmentâs blessing. Theyâre being embraced by banks, fintech firms, and maybe soon by everyday consumers sending money across borders or paying rent digitally. Bitcoin, meanwhile, is on the outside looking in. Still popular. Still powerful. But politically orphaned. If this trend continues, cryptoâs future may belong to the regulated, dollar-linked digital tokens, and not the decentralized dream that Bitcoin represents. The big question: can Bitcoin stay relevant in a post-GENIUS world? For now, Bitcoin remains king on Wall Street. But in Washington, itâs rapidly becoming an afterthought. In a town where the rules are now being written, thatâs a dangerous place to be. Bitcoincongressregulation Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

A combination of Wall Street capital, corporate adoption, and a deepening supply crisis is quietly forging a new future for the worldâs most important blockchain. The GENIUS Act gives stablecoins real legal backing, paving the way for instant payments, lower fees, and a safer digital dollar you can actually trust. The GENIUS Act brings crypto out of the shadows and into the American financial system. Car buyers could lose up to $7,500 in federal incentives after September 30âbut the rules are murky, and the government hasnât said exactly what happens next. Entities linked to the president can now sell up to nearly $1 billion worth of $TRUMP. The question is: will they? The worldâs largest cryptocurrency is on a historic run fueled by new money and government spending, but some analysts warn this is not a normal rally.

Global Times By Global Times Published: Jul 18, 2025 05:39 PM In response to a Wall Street Journal report claiming that China would block a deal in which CK Hutchison Holdings would transfer ownership of its Panama Canal port and dozens of other ports globally to Western investors such as BlackRock unless China COSCO Shipping Corporation was granted a stake, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said on Friday that he is not aware of the situation the reporter mentioned. Regarding CK Hutchison's sale of overseas port assets, China's State Administration for Market Regulation has already stated that it will conduct a review in accordance with the law, protect fair market competition, and safeguard the public interest, Lin said. The spokesperson also emphasized that China has always firmly opposed acts of economic coercion and bullying that infringe upon the legitimate rights and interests of other countries.

Title: Ether Prices Reach A Fresh, 6-Month High Near $3,700
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/07/18/ether-prices-reach-a-fresh-6-month-high-near-3700/

ByCharles Lloyd Bovaird II ByCharles Lloyd Bovaird II, Senior Contributor. Ether prices reached a six-month high on July 18, fueled by multiple bullish factors. Ether prices rallied on Friday, July 18, approaching $3,700 and attaining their highest value since early January. The world’s second-most valuable digital currency by market value reached $3,677.40 during the day, according to Coinbase data from TradingView. At this point, the cryptocurrency was trading at its loftiest price since approximately January 7. The ether token has been having a very strong month, rallying more than 50% after falling to as little as roughly $2,400 near the start of July, additional Coinbase figures from TradingView reveal. When asked what fueled these latest gains, analysts who contributed input for this article highlighted several factors, including the recent legislative developments such as the government’s decision to approve the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS Act). The YouTuber who goes by Wendy O commented on this particular matter, stating that “Ethereum has been on an absolute tear recently. And I honestly think we can attribute most of it to the GENIUS Act getting approved and then of course, BlackRock filing to allow staking of Ethereum in their iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA).” Doug Colkitt, a founding contributor at Fogo, also weighed in, identifying several causal factors. “Ethereum is benefiting from a mix of structural and speculative drivers," he stated via email. “The rally is partly fueled by renewed momentum across DeFi and tokenized assets, which continue to build atop Ethereum’s infrastructure. On top of that, with Bitcoin dominance stretched, investors are rotating into other majors like ETH that offer strong narratives, robust developer activity, and room to run,” said Colkitt. “If ETF progress continues, Ethereum could be on the verge of a new capital influx cycle," he concluded. Mike Cahill, CEO of Douro Labs, also provided his take on ether’s latest price rally. “Ethereum is catching a wave of renewed institutional interest, driven by the broader tailwinds from ETF optimism and a rotation into high-beta assets,” he stated. “But under the hood, there’s also growing traction in the tokenization and L2 space, both of which are Ethereum-native narratives. As institutions begin allocating capital across more than just Bitcoin, Ethereum is naturally the next step, especially given its programmability and network effects across both DeFi and RWAs,” said Cahill. Joe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency hedge fund manager BitBull Capital, offered input on ether’s latest upside, citing a range of causal factors. “Ether’s rally toward $3,700 is being fueled by record inflows into spot ETH ETFs, with institutional investors showing renewed conviction,” he stated via email. “Regulatory clarity from the GENIUS Act is also boosting sentiment, especially as Ethereum plays a central role in the stablecoin ecosystem. Add in whale accumulation and a strong technical breakout, and we’re seeing a surge that looks more sustainable than past speculative runs.” Greg Magadini, director of derivatives for digital asset data provider Amberdata, took a different tack than the other respondents, focusing on staking activity. “Today we have the highest ETH staking rate ever seen. About 30% of all ETH is now staked," he emphasized via email. "As Ethereum staking rates increase, the available liquid ETH remaining to trade is reduced (a smaller tradable float). Combine this phenomenon with ETH etf inflows, corporate treasury allocations and a longtime ETH underperformance and we get an explosive 'upside move,’” said Magadini. “Everyone is trying to buy at the same time!” he stressed. The crypto derivatives expert also spoke to the impact of regulatory developments, as well as supply-demand dynamics. “This week’s regulatory clarity and prospects for stablecoin adoption are great catalysts to create investment demand for ETH and other EVM based chains (65% of all USDC is on EVM chains), but the real key to explosive upside is the dynamics of increased demand with a simultaneous decrease in tradable supply," said Magadini. “There’s a lot of upside to ETH as the historical range of ETH prices to BTC prices ranges from 2% to 11% which implies ETH could rally from a low of $2,000 to $12,000 given Bitcoin’s current value,” he noted. One analyst in particular focused on investors rotating their capital from bitcoin into altcoins. When asked what fueled ether’s latest gains, Julio Moreno, head of research for CryptoQuant, responded that “I think that it generally has to do with early signals that investors/traders are rotating part of their capital from Bitcoin to altcoins, as these coins reached extremely undervalued levels compared to Bitcoin.” “Purchases of ETH from US-based ETFs have outperformed purchases of Bitcoin. You can see this in the ratio of ETH to Bitcoin holdings of these ETFs,” he stated via Telegram. “The ratio has increased from 0.02 in April to 0.09 today." The chart below helps illustrate these developments: ETF: ETH/BTC Total Holdings Ratio “A similar dynamic can be observed in the relative spot trading volume ratio for these coins, which has been increasing in the same period, indicating higher growth in ETH trading activity than in Bitcoin,” he stated. The chart below illustrates this situation: Bitcoin and ether weekly spot trading volume

This week: We dig into who exactly is holding Strategy's Bitcoin billions, both Coinbase and Strategy rack up stock records, and more companies make crypto treasury moves. There isn’t a public list of the custodians holding Strategy’s $70 billion worth of Bitcoin. But there’s strong evidence that the SEC knows. And Strategy has said enough in public filings that we were able to put together a short list of potential custodians. Strategy appears to have told the SEC who custodies its Bitcoin in a 2023 response to an inquiry from the regulator. At the time, the industry was still reeling from FTX’s collapse and the resulting contagion that followed. And, more importantly, Silvergate Bank—which in 2022 lent Strategy $205 million to buy more Bitcoin, and held 34,619 BTC as collateral—had just shuttered. The SEC asked Strategy point-blank who it uses as custodians, strongly hinting that it was worried about the BTC held at Silvergate. Strategy answered, but invoked SEC Rule 83 to keep its list out of the public domain. But what it did say narrows the list down to 9 companies: BitGo, Coinbase, GMO-Z.com, Fidelity, Bakkt, Gemini, NYDIG, Paxos, and Standard Custody & Trust Company. Suffice it to say, Strategy still hasn’t replied to a request from Decrypt to comment on the matter. Coinbase and Strategy smashed through record highs this week, thanks to a crypto market that’s suddenly awash in fresh money. COIN hit multiple all-time high price marks over the course of the week, as analysts pointed to the surge in trading volume, the influx of ETF‑related inflows, and new custody deals as tailwinds. Now the firm has done it again to close out the week, finishing Friday at a new closing peak of $419.78 after hitting a new intraday peak of $444.65. The weekly surge came after Argus Research initiated coverage with a “buy” rating and $400 price target and JMP Securities doubled down on its “market outperform” reading. Rosenblatt also reiterated its buy rating on Thursday. Strategy—Michael Saylor’s unapologetic Bitcoin hoarder—hit its own all-time high market cap close on Wednesday as the company’s relentless buying spree pushed its holdings to 601,550 BTC. But MSTR hasn’t held onto its gains. On Friday, things weren’t so rosy for Strategy, with its stock falling more than 6% by close. Is it the Jim Cramer curse? The long-time crypto critic recently mentioned Strategy during an appearance on CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street”—but his comments were pretty cryptic. He recounted that someone approached him and asked if he “would be the figurehead” for a business “about, you know, one of the coins”—apparently referring to Bitcoin. He said he turned it down. “I was kind of like [JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon],” he said, “I’m kind of like lukewarm on that.” It’s difficult to go a day without hearing about a new crypto treasury company or an existing one adding to its coffers. And the investor response isn’t always to take the stock straight to the moon. This week was no exception. Bitcoin mining firm Bit Origin saw its share price spike after raising $500 million to start a Dogecoin treasury. The miner, which trades on the Nasdaq under the BTOG ticker, has been slow to come down off that high. As of Friday close, its stock was still changing hands for $0.78—nearly double the price it started the week at. Ethereum juggernaut Sharplink double dipped this week, picking up $48 million on Monday and then $225 million on Tuesday, and told the SEC on Thursday that it’s upsizing its $1 billion raise to $6 billion—all in the name of buying more ETH. Sharplink, which trades on the Nasdaq under the SBET ticker, has gained 16% since the start of the week. But it lost a whopping 20% off its share price in the past day and finished the day trading hands at $28.98 a share. There’s also a new Bitcoin treasury company in the mix. E-bike maker Volcon saw its shares soar 135% on Thursday as it said it plans to raise $500 million to start buying BTC. The shareholder euphoria was short-lived, though. On Friday, VLCN shares finished the day trading for $17.11 after falling by nearly 21%. No gray area. OG crypto asset manager Grayscale has made its intentions clear: The firm has filed preliminary paperwork that could lead to an IPO as the industry basks in a resurgence of interest in IPOs. But so far, the S-1 is still in draft mode while the firm, the issuer of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, works out the kinks. High stakes. Perhaps you’ve heard it’s ETH szn? Seen an altcoin ticker tape parade? Maybe heard the rumble of XRP Army troop movements? On Wall Street, the altcoin jubilee has iShares Ethereum Trust issuer BlackRock yearning for the ability to stake the nearly $8 billion worth of ETH it holds. Bad news: The SEC isn’t due to start issuing verdicts on staking for Ethereum ETFs until October.

Title: President Trump Officially Signs The GENIUS Stablecoin Act Into Law, BlackRock Is Now Buying 5x More Ethereum As Bitcoin

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. In a seminal development, President Trump has now officially signed the GENIUS stablecoin act, more formally known as the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act, into law. This marks the first time the US has enacted a significant crypto-focused law. The GENIUS Act passed 308-122. pic.twitter.com/ijVebDHua6 The legislation stumbled earlier this week when some House members raised concerns regarding the supposed lacunae within the GENIUS stablecoin act, including its failure to safeguard self-custody of crypto assets, as well as the lack of a formal preclusion of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). President Trump then invited some of the discenting members to the White House, ultimately managing to win over 11 out of the 12 additional Congress members required to ensure the passage of the act. For the benefit of those who might not be aware, the GENIUS stablecoin act creates a comprehensive framework for regulating stablecoins. Among other things, it mandates that stablecoins pegged to the US Dollar have to be backed by eligible reserves - consisting of US Treasuries with maturities of 93 days or less, US dollars, or similar liquid assets - on a 1:1 basis. The legislation also requires regular reserve audits and monthly disclosures. Large stablecoin issuers, with a market cap of $50 billion or more, will be subjected to an annual financial audit. Under the proposed framework, banks and other eligible entities can issue stablecoins without the onerous requirements entailed under securities laws. However, all issuers will have to comply with anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including rules pertaining to the so-called Know Your Customer (KYC) framework. The law also prioritizes a stablcoin holder's claims to the issuer's reserves over the claims of creditors in the event of a bankruptcy. The law also prevents domestic and foreign issuers of stablecoins from offering interest to the holders of these coins. The GENIUS stablecoin act is expected to provide a major boost to the USD-pegged stablecoins, with the sector's TAM expected to grow from around $240 billion right now to $750 billion by the end of 2026. Of course, the House has also passed two other bills in what was widely dubbed as the Crypto Week: the anti-CBDC Act and the Clarity Act, which formally divides regulatory jurisdiction over the crypto sector between the SEC and CFTC and creates a framework for consumer protection. Both of these bills are now headed to the Senate. BLACKROCK IS STILL BUYING MORE ETH THAN BTCBlackRock’s purchase of over half a billion dollars of ETH ($547M) exceeded its Bitcoin inflow ($497M) by $50 Million USD.Weighted by market cap, BlackRock is buying over 5 TIMES the amount of ETH compared to BTC. pic.twitter.com/fnvjvKXQ0N Meanwhile, in what constitutes a significant development, the asset management titan BlackRock is now manifestly favoring Ethereum over Bitcoin. This suggests a new altcoin mania might be at hand. Under the GENIUS stablecoin law, stablecoin issuers must procure either a federal or state license to operate. The federal licenses have to be procured from the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). Of course, small stablecoin issuers - with a market cap of under $10 billion - can opt for either a state or federal license. However, this choice is not available to larger issuers, who are mandated to seek federal licenses under the GENIUS stablecoin law. The chosen regulator has to decide on a given application within 120 days. As a part of the licensing framework, applicants must demonstrate sufficient capitalization and their possession of liquid, high quality reserves on a 1:1 basis representing a 100 percent backing of all issued stablecoins, robust internal control mechanisms, and compliance with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) rules and regulations. Bear in mind that existing stablecoin issuers such as Circle have a grace period to ensure compliance with the law. GENIUS stablecoin law becomes effective at the earliest of either 18 months after its passage or 120 days after final regulations are issued. Ths biggest loser under the law is Tether, which is a foreign issuer and can't legally distribute it's USDT stablecoin the US now. As such, non-compliant stablecoins have to be phased out within 3 years. Tether can, however, create a new US-based subsidiary or partner with an approved stablecoin issuer to maintain its footprint in the US. Of course, Tether's biggest backer is the investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald, whose former chairman, Howard Lutnick, is the current US Treasury Secretary. So, there is hope yet for Tether. Big Tech also loses under the GENIUS stablecoin law as these companies - which are not primarily involved in the financial services sphere - will now have to win a unanimous approval from the Stablecoin Certification Review Committee - comprised of the Treasury Secretary (chair), the Fed Chair/Vice Chair for Supervision, and the FDIC Chair - to issue their bespoke stablecoins.

Title: Wall Street backs Ethereum as ETH stablecoin dominance hits 54%

From stablecoins to staking, ETH is becoming the reserve asset of the onchain economy. Ethereum is gaining momentum with a 20% rally, driven by U.S. policy support, growing DeFi demand, and major institutional treasury allocations. Falling Bitcoin dominance and rising Ethereum activity hint at an incoming altseason led by ETH. Ethereum [ETH] is back in the spotlight – and this time, Wall Street is watching closely. As stablecoin adoption soars and real-world assets go on-chain, ETH is emerging as more than just a utility token. Ethereum is no longer just the foundation for DeFi and NFTs – it’s fast becoming Wall Street’s on-chain reserve. With over 54% of stablecoins issued on Ethereum and billions in tokenized real-world assets settling on its network, ETH is now seen as digital collateral akin to Treasuries or gold. These developments come as BlackRock filed to add staking to its Ethereum ETFs. From Fidelity to Electric Capital, institutions increasingly treat Ethereum as a sovereign financial layer where ETH is the reserve asset. Its role in collateralization, settlement, and staking-backed yield positions it as the backbone of the emerging digital dollar economy, reshaping how TradFi views and uses blockchain infrastructure. After months of Bitcoin dominance climbing steadily since December 2024, the tide may be turning. BTC dominance recently broke below a key threshold; mirroring patterns seen ahead of prior altseason bursts. Source: X In previous market cycles, a drop in Bitcoin dominance often led to a capital rotation into altcoins, with Ethereum typically leading the charge. Now, Ethereum is up 20% in the past week, outperforming Bitcoin. Its daily active addresses and transaction volume have hit record highs, signaling strong network engagement. This divergence, combined with falling Bitcoin dominance, suggests a potential regime shift in the crypto market. Historically, Ethereum’s strength has triggered broader altcoin rallies. If momentum continues, this breakout could be the start of a new altcoin season. Ethereum’s recent rally isn’t just driven by market momentum—it’s backed by real catalysts. Nic Puckrin, crypto analyst and founder of The Coin Bureau, pointed to the impact of U.S. legislation like the CLARITY and GENIUS Acts, stating: “GENIUS targets yield-bearing stablecoins, and this is great news for Ethereum-based DeFi.” Institutional confidence is also rising. SharpLink Gaming, chaired by Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin, added $225 million in ETH to its treasury. Meanwhile, Bitmine Immersion Technologies, backed by Peter Thiel, has pivoted to Ethereum reserves, now holding over $500 million in ETH. Puckrin believes Ethereum is gaining serious traction: “Momentum is clearly on Ethereum’s side,” he said, projecting a near-term test of $4,000. Still, he offered a word of caution: “What goes up must come down.” Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

Title: Show HN: molab, a cloud-hosted marimo notebook workspace
URL: https://marimo.io/blog/announcing-molab
Time Published: 2025-07-18T18:40:30Z

🍃 Announcing molab: run and share marimo notebooks in the cloud, for free marimo team @marimo_io molab is a cloud-hosted marimo notebook workspace that lets you rapidly experiment on data using Python and SQL. We’re giving molab (mo for marimo) to you, our community, for free. To create your first notebook, visit https://molab.marimo.io. To get inspired, check out example notebooks on visualizing embeddings, calling LLM inference providers with HuggingFace by Vaibhav Srivastav from Hugging Face, annotating data with W&B Weave by Scott Condron from W&B, and more. Highlights. Create your first notebook by navigating to https://molab.marimo.io. If this is your first-time using molab, you’ll be prompted to create an account. Each notebook runs in an environment with several popular packages pre-installed, including torch, numpy, polars, and more. marimo’s built-in package manager will install additional packages as you import them, using uv. As packages are installed, an associated pyproject.toml file is updated, keeping a record of your notebook’s dependencies. In the near future, we plan to add support for syncing these dependencies, so that the next time you start your notebook it will run with the dependencies you installed. To get a shareable link, click the link icon in the top-right. Notebooks are public but undiscoverable. Notebooks get persistent storage; view the file tree by clicking the file icon in the sidebar. From here you can upload additional data files, which are stored in a Cloudflare R2 bucket. You can download the notebook directory by clicking the download button, also on the top-right. To run your notebook locally after downloading it, install uv then use uv run marimo edit notebook.py To download the notebook locally, just pass the notebook URL to marimo edit. For example: Today, this brings just the notebook file down, and does not include your attached storage. We launched marimo last year on HackerNews, after incubating it at Stanford and tech startups. Since then, marimo has been downloaded over four million times, with over 300k monthly downloads, blown past Jupyter in GitHub stars (14.5k and counting!), and has been adopted by Fortune 500 companies, cutting-edge startups, and research institutes alike for ML, AI, data engineering, data science, and more. Along the way, our company was backed by the best investors in data. While you can use marimo locally (just pip install marimo), many of you have told us how valuable a marimo-powered Colab-like service would be for running machine learning and AI workloads. In fact, the most popular recent feature request in Google Colab’s issue tracker asks for marimo support in Colab: Rather than try to convince Google to replace their notebook with marimo, we decided to just build molab instead. marimo is a modern notebook for modern data workflows, so it’s only fitting that we built molab on a modern tech stack: Making the next generation of interactive computing accessible to everyone. In addition to reinventing the Python notebook, we’re also on a mission to make marimo accessible to anyone with an internet connection. That’s why we launched support for WebAssembly notebooks last year, making it possible to run lightweight notebooks entirely in the browser (of course, you can also run marimo on your laptop, on cloud servers, or anywhere you can run software). But while our WebAssembly playground makes snappy interactive compute widely available, it is limited in the packages it supports and the computation it can exploit. molab is our next step in democratizing the next generation of interactive computing: backed by cloud computing, molab lets you create and share notebooks that use any Python package and that run on powerful hardware. We have a lot more planned for molab, but for now — please try it out, share feedback, and have fun making awesome notebooks! What’s the difference between molab and Google Colab? Google Colab is a hosted Jupyter notebook service provider. molab is a hosted marimo notebook service with similar compute and sharing capabilities, but powered by marimo notebooks instead of Jupyter. Is molab marimo’s enterprise product? No. If you’re interested in a next-generation data platform for modern AI and data workloads — with marimo’s trademark developer experience, complete with security and governance required for enterprises — get in touch. I’m behind the times, what’s marimo? marimo is an open-source reactive notebook for Python that is designed specifically for working with data. marimo notebooks are stored as pure Python (version with Git), shareable as data apps, executable as scripts or pipelines, reproducible in execution and packaging, have SQL built-in, and make it easy to connect to your own databases and data lakes. marimo has no dependencies on Jupyter or IPython, and is built entirely from scratch. marimo was originally developed with input from scientists at Stanford and developers in industry. With over 300k monthly downloads and 14k GitHub stars, it is now used broadly at companies like Cloudflare, BlackRock, Shopify, OpenAI, and Hugging Face, and universities like Stanford and Berkeley. Is molab free? molab is currently free to use, as long as usage is reasonable. Our goal is to make is as easy as possible for our community to use marimo notebooks. How do I get more RAM, CPU or GPUs? Reach out to us and we’ll see what we can do! I’m a compute provider. How do I get plugged into molab as an offered backend? Get in touch. How does molab relate to marimo’s open source notebook? molab is a hosted version of marimo’s open source notebook. You can use marimo on your own machine or on your own remote servers. How does molab relate to marimo’s WebAssembly playground? The WebAssembly playground runs notebooks entirely in the browser through Pyodide. This makes for a snappy user experience, at the cost of limited compute and limited support for Python packages. The playground is well-suited for lightweight notebooks and embedding interactive notebooks in documentation, but it is not well-suited for modern ML or AI workflows. molab is currently entirely separate from the WebAssembly playground. In the future we may merge them into a unified experience. How does molab relate to marimo’s community cloud? Our community cloud provides a place to organize and share WebAssembly notebooks. molab is currently entirely separate from the community cloud. In the future we may merge them into a unified experience. © 2025 Marimo Inc. All rights reserved.

Skip to comments. Posted on 07/18/2025 10:34:39 AM PDT by MinorityRepublican The NYC Partnership threw a party — but no one really showed up. A who’s who of the New York City business community were no shows for a Tuesday meet and greet session with socialist democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani. The list of New York City-based CEOs that declined the Partnership’s invitation includes Jamie Dimon, the nation’s top banker and chief of JP Morgan, the nations largest bank; Steve Schwarzman, the CEO of private equity powerhouse Blackstone; Brian Moynihan, the head of Bank of America, the nations second largest bank; Larry Fink, the CEO of Blackrock, the worlds largest asset manager; and David Solomon, the CEO of investment banking giant Goldman Sachs. Most publicly pleaded “scheduling conflicts.” But “what is this guy going to tell us that we don’t already know?” is how someone close to Solomon described the situation. Those sentiments were pretty universal among according to sources at the banks of the CEOs who didn’t attend. (Excerpt) Read more at nypost.com ...

Title: Lido rallies 21%, hits 2-month high – Can LDO bulls hold on?

Time Published: 2025-07-18T17:00:59Z

LIDO DAO surges 21% to a 2 months high as investors rush into the market following Blackrock’s filing of ETHA staking LIDO surged 21.53% hitting $1.15, then retraced to $1.13. Buyers rushed into the market following Blackrock’s filing for ETHA staking, scooping up over 60 million tokens. Lido [LDO] rallied 21.53% reaching a 2-month high of $1.15 before slightly retracing to $1.13 by press time. As a result, the altcoin’s market cap reclaimed $1 billion mark for the first time in two months. At the same time, its trading volume surged 219.9% to $471 million, reflecting growing demand and network activity. But what triggered the surge? According to AMBCrypto, the price uptick is in part driven by BlackRock’s recent filing to add staking to its Ethereum ETF [ETHA]. This move is significant for Lido because staking mainly happens through LDO. Thus, all ETH staking processes will run through LDO, something that most market participants have interpreted as a bullish signal. Significantly, this move to stake ETH through a third party could boost demand for Lido’s stETH derivatives, thus enhancing POS. Following BlackRock’s filing, investors rushed into the market to accumulate the altcoin. According to Coinalyze, Lido Dao saw 48.6 million in Buy Volume compared to 45.7 million in Sell Volume on July 17th. At the time of writing, the altcoin recorded 15.3 million in Buy Volume relative to 13.4 million in Sell Volume. As a result, the altcoin experienced two consecutive days of positive Buy-Sell Delta, at 2.8 and 1.8 million, respectively. Typically, a higher buy volume indicates strong market conviction as investors shift to aggressive accumulation. Unsurprisingly, as LDO prices rallied, so did the profit-taking urge by holders and investors in equal measures. Spot Netflow hiked to a 6-month high of $5.2 million before dropping to $2.77 million as of this writing. Source: CoinGlass A high Netflow implies increased Exchange Inflow compared to Outflow, a clear sign of aggressive selling. For that reason, Lido Finance’s scarcity has been evidenced by the declining Stock-to-Flow Ratio. According to Santiment, SFR declined to 26.4, reflecting an increase in LDO available for immediate sale on Exchanges. Source: Santiment Typically, a lower scarcity precedes lower prices amid mounting downward pressure on an asset. According to AMBCrypto’s analysis, Lido saw a strong uptrend as buyers rushed into the market following good news. As a result, the altcoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) surged to 78, at press time, touching overbought territory. At the same time, DMI spiked to 41, indicating strong upward momentum and its potential for continuation. Source: TradingView When these momentum indicators are configured in this manner, they suggest that Lido may continue to make gains. That said, if buyers can hold on and continue accumulating, LDO could target $1.4. However, profit takers pose a threat to the continued uptrend, and if they overwhelm buyers, a pullback is likely to follow. If LDO faces rejection here, the altcoin will find support around $0.97.

The move, which reasserts Libya’s 2019 maritime agreement with Ankara, comes amid heightened regional diplomacy and renewed Cypriot-Turkish deadlock. Greece has dismissed the claims as legally void, but the timing reflects growing alignment between Khalifa Haftar’s eastern bloc in Libya and Turkish strategic aims, despite earlier being staunch enemies. Haftar is now positioning himself as a gatekeeper to offshore gas corridors and international recognition. With Turkey’s foreign minister engaging at the UN on Cyprus, Libya’s new maritime push creates leverage for Ankara on multiple fronts: it pressures Greece, undercuts Egypt’s quiet coordination with Haftar’s rivals in Tripoli, and signals continued Turkish reach in Mediterranean maritime negotiations. The note verbale is unlikely to result in enforcement but reshapes the legal-political map enough to keep energy and boundary negotiations unsettled, and both Ankara and Haftar benefit from this ambiguity. Discovery & Development ConocoPhillips is ramping up oil exploration in Alaska’s National Petroleum Reserve, aiming to drill four wells and run seismic surveys over 300 square miles this winter. The push comes as the company looks beyond the $7B Willow project, which is set to start flowing 180,000 bpd by 2029. New activity is backed by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed by Republicans and signed by Trump, mandating at least five lease sales and a rollback to Trump-era rules. Conoco sees Alaska as a long-term oil play with 8.7 billion barrels still on the table. Azule Energy, the BP–Eni joint venture, just struck gas in Angola’s first-ever exploration well dedicated solely to gas. Drilled in Block 1/14 of the Lower Congo Basin, the Gajajeira-01 well hit pay with over 1 Tcf of gas and 100 million barrels of condensate, according to early estimates. The find is being called a turning point for Angola’s gas ambitions, which have long played second fiddle to oil. Azule operates the block with 35%, alongside Equinor (30%), Sonangol (25%), and local firm Acrep (10%). Aker BP hit more oil in Norway’s North Sea, confirming two out of five targets at its Omega Alfa well in the Yggdrasil area. The discovery adds to rising volumes there, with recoverables now pegged at 700 MMboe, up from 650 MMboe after folding in the East Frigg Beta/Epsilon find. Yggdrasil’s first oil is still expected in 2027, but cost estimates have climbed to $12.1B. Meanwhile, pipelay and topsides construction are advancing fast, and the company’s broader North Sea and Norwegian Sea projects—including Valhall, Alvheim, Johan Sverdrup, and Skarv Satellites—are all pushing toward fresh output over the next two years. CNOOC has made another major find in the Beibu Gulf, striking a 211-meter oil and gas pay zone at its WZ10-5S-2d well—its second big hit in the area after the earlier 283-meter pay at WZ10-5-1Sa. The new well, drilled to 3,362 meters, is the first major breakthrough in China’s offshore exploration of metamorphic sandstone and slate buried hills. Initial flows hit 400 bpd of crude and 165 Mcf/d of gas, reinforcing CNOOC’s bet on deep play and buried hill formations. The company says this opens the door to large-scale exploration in mature basins like Beibu, with more production gains likely in the pipeline. Chevron is backing a $100M exploration push in Peru’s offshore Block Z-62, partnering with Anadarko after seismic studies revealed signs of a new oil and gas field. The block, located off La Libertad and Lambayeque, could help Peru close its hydrocarbon trade gap—currently importing double the diesel it produces. The plan includes drilling five exploratory and ten confirmatory wells–a significant step in boosting domestic output. Peru’s energy ministry is framing the project as a critical step toward energy security and long-overdue reactivation of its oil and gas sector. Equinor’s wildcat well 34/6-8 S in the North Sea’s Garantiana NV prospect came up dry, with no hydrocarbons found in the Cook Formation target. The well, drilled by the Deepsea Atlantic rig, hit 105 meters of Cook Formation but encountered only water-bearing sandstone. It’s the eighth well in PL 554 and has now been permanently plugged and abandoned. This follows another dry hole at the Lit prospect, though Equinor did recently score a gas find at its Skred prospect in the Barents Sea. Assam is now the first state in India with a direct stake in crude production, following a hydrocarbon discovery at the Namrup Borhat-1 well. Through a likely 10% interest via Assam Hydrocarbon and Energy Co., the state will share in both the revenue and risk alongside Oil India Ltd. (OIL). Assam already ranks #3 in India’s onshore crude output, but this shift from royalty recipient to equity partner puts it in a new league. Chief Minister Sarma called it a milestone for energy security and a signal that Assam is done playing a passive role in India’s oil story. BlackRock is leading a group set to invest around $10B in Saudi Aramco’s massive Jafurah gas project, marking another pipeline-style leaseback deal. Like Aramco’s 2021 infrastructure transactions, the group won’t own the assets outright—Aramco keeps control while paying tariffs to investors for using the pipelines and processing facilities. Jafurah is Aramco’s $100B shale gas bet, touted as the largest non-U.S. shale project, and key to boosting Saudi gas output 60% by 2030. For Saudi Arabia, it’s another way to cash in on energy assets without relinquishing control, while shoring up funds for economic diversification. Deals, Mergers & Acquisitions SLB just locked in final approval for its $7.8B merger with ChampionX after the UK’s CMA signed off on a package of divestitures aimed at easing monopoly fears. The deal—delayed for months by regulatory scrutiny—will close Wednesday, giving SLB new firepower in production chemicals and drilling services. To get it done, SLB and ChampionX agreed to offload overlapping UK assets, sell ChampionX’s US Synthetic unit, and license quartz sensor tech to competitors. Norway's competition authority had already greenlit the deal in April, clearing the last real hurdle. Perenco has wrapped up its acquisition of Woodside’s Greater Angostura assets in Trinidad & Tobago, securing operatorship of offshore fields producing 50,000 boepd. The deal includes stakes in the 2(C) and 3(A) PSCs plus an onshore terminal, and pushes Perenco’s T&T output above 100,000 boepd. The move deepens its foothold in the region and boosts gas output to over 500 mscfd. Perenco says it's banking on its expertise in mature fields to extend the life of Angostura while backing T&T’s economic growth. To access this exclusive content...

Title: Good Riddance: CalPERS’ Atrocious General Counsel Matt Jacobs to Retire

Why, pray tell, would the nation’s biggest public pension fund that also runs its own health insurance program hire a general counsel with no experience whatsoever in investment management, financial regulatory compliance, insurance, government public disclosure and other state agency requirements, and instead had been a private sector criminal defense attorney? Oh, and by credible rumor, one who was looking for a new gig because he wasn’t generating fees at the level that his law firm expected of partners? Hiring a crook-protector like Matt Jacobs as general counsel sure looked like a statement of CalPERS’ ‘intent to engage in less than savory conduct. Shortly after she joined CalPERS as CEO, Marcie Frost asked to meet us for dinner. She reneged when she realized I intended to treat the discussion on the record. At the time, I told her she should fire Jacobs. The Matt Jacobs rap sheet below shows our recommendation to have been well warranted. These and many more posts document either his complicity in trying to cover up rather than correct CalPERS’ bad actions, or his direct role in dereliction of duty, above all in making sure CalPERS had adequate controls and procedures. So we can take only a tiny bit of comfort from the fact that Matt Jacobs is retiring at the end of this month. It should have happened a long time ago. Remember this is only a partial list.

From CalPERS Chief Investment Officer Ben Meng Resigns Following Our Exposing His False, Felonious Financial Disclosure Filings and Private Equity Conflicts of Interest: CalPERS Chief Investment Officer Ben Meng resigned effective Wednesday August 5. This was less than three days after we exposed Meng having made multiple felonious1 false statements on financial disclosure forms as well as holding investments in private equity firms when CalPERS was making multi-hundred-billion dollar commitments to them.2 Since Meng was seen in the office in routine internal meetings Wednesday morning, it appears his departure was not voluntary. We were also first to break the story of his resignation, via Twitter; you can read the press release here: We have from two sources that CalPERS CIO Ben Meng has submitted his resignation, presumably due to: https://t.co/mnfZHyd0eG — Yves Smith (@yvessmith) August 6, 2020 This outcome was a self-inflicted wound. Remember that the Forms 700 that exposed Meng’s misconduct went first to CalPERS, which then sends them to the Fair Political Practices Commission. Apparently no one reviewed the documents, much the less suggested Meng correct them, even though CalPERS’ written policy is that the Form 700 is to be submitted in time so that the employee’s supervisor, which in Meng’s case was CEO Marcie Frost, can review it. Apparently, no one checked the Form 700 against Meng’s trading records, which CalPERS should also have on file. Apparently, no one even told Meng to amend his form when CalPERS was about to post it on CalPERS’ site. And we will see when we get the results of our Public Records Act request, but it appears likely that CalPERS did not require Meng to recuse himself on private equity investment pitches from the firms whose stocks he held: Ares, Blackstone, and Carlyle…. CalPERS accelerated its decay when it chose a white-collar defense attorney, Matt Jacobs, as General Counsel in 2014. Despite having sworn an oath to defend the laws of California and having constitutional duties that make protecting beneficiaries paramount, Jacobs clearly sees his job as shielding the executive team. And that has included thwarting board members in making what at any well-functioning institution would be non-controversial inquiries, like getting senior management resignation letters, copies of procedure manuals, minutes of closed session board meetings, and internal audit reports. Jacobs has repeatedly sullied CalPERS by regularly telling falsehoods in public, which is toxic model for an institution’s top compliance officer. The examples are too numerous to catalogue in full… Needless to say, this conduct is deeply corrosive. It telegraphs to employees that something is deeply wrong. People whose job it to tell the truth think there is no payoff for doing the right thing, only punishment. This message has been powerfully reinforced by Frost and Meng forcing out some of the few remaining competent executives: Elisabeth Bourqui, apparently for questioning a “private equity new business model” that eventually died under the weight of its own contradictions, and then two highly regarded investment professionals, Ron Legnado and Paul Mouchakka. Yet the CalPERS board, unwilling to look at its own culpability in this run of escalating scandals, chooses to blame commies under the bed, um, supposed pension haters. In fact, as we have catalogued, these transgressions were all unforced errors that merely adequate oversight would have prevented. There would be almost no bad stories about CalPERS if CalPERS didn’t keep generating them. Although CalPEERS has some competition from the disastrously underfunded and deeply corrupt Kentucky Retirement System, CalPERS under Marcie Frost has done more to damage the image of public pension funds in the US than any other force. From Criminality, CalPERS Style: Board Members Misappropriate Public Funds by Signing Blank, Undated Expense Forms: Pictures really can be worth a thousand words. The images below and related evidence demonstrate conclusively that many, perhaps most, CalPERS board members have been filing fraudulent expense forms on a regular basis, some over a period of years. This is a written policy, codified in CalPERS’ board manual and is clearly intended to circumvent California state requirements. The Board Services Unit, which reports to the Board President, asks board members to pre-sign blank sheets of paper with just a blank signature line printed on them. The Board Services Unit later prints onto that signed blank page the body of the travel claim form, with the dollar amounts and date filled in, and submits it on board members’ behalf. Importantly, the form that CalPERS board members have been endorsing in blank requires the signature to certify a statement contained immediately above the signature that validates the accuracy of the information submitted on of the form. As you can see in one of the photos below, that certification is deliberately omitted from the nearly blank page that the board members sign in advance…. As Andrew Silton, former Chief Investment Officer for North Carolina, said by e-mail: There’s a pretty simple rule in the realm of public pension management. You don’t sign blank signature pages whether it’s an investment management contract or an expenditure report. During my tenure as CIO for North Carolina we sometimes had to go to great lengths to get entire contracts and reports into the hands of the State Treasurer (the sole fiduciary) because he had to know what he was signing. Whether he was committing the pension to a multi-million dollar contract or requesting reimbursement for a few hundred dollars of travel expenses, he was drawing funds that belong to the pension trust. His signature, and at times my signature, had to be attached to completed documents. Filling out expenditure reports was often a cumbersome task, and I needed help on numerous occasions to get the figures into the correct boxes on North Carolina’s expenditure form. So I suppose it would have been convenient to just sign a bunch of blank forms and dump a stack of receipts on someone’s desk. Aside from violating the law, this would have sent a terrible signal to staff and invited abuse. Travel expenditures are a precious commodity in pension management. They allow fiduciaries and staff to perform proper due diligence. When abuses are unearthed (e.g. padding expense reports) public pensions tend to crack down. Not only is the abuse addressed, but legitimate travel is also curtailed. The board of CalPERS shouldn’t need any training or lawyers to help them understand the importance of protecting the expenditure process. It’s amazing to me that all but a few board members at CalPERS seem to have no qualms about signing blank expenditure forms. Once again, it appears that senior staff rather than the board is in control at CalPERS… On January 15, the day before Margaret Brown’s first day as a board member at CalPERS, she attended an orientation meeting with fellow incoming board member David Miller. Members of the Board Services Unit, all but one of whom are relatively low-level administrative staff, led the briefing. They gave Brown a raft of forms to sign and hand back to them. This is what she was given: Brown signed them in front of staff before saying she wanted to look at them some more and took the folder with the signed copies with her. She did not return them…. Note that the certification language that sits right above the signature line has been omitted from the blank form Brown was asked to sign: I HEREBY CERTIFY That the above is a true statement of the travel expenses incurred by me in accordance with DPA rules in the service of the State of California. If a privately owned vehicle was used, and if mileage rates exceed the minimum rate, I certify that the cost of operating the vehicle was equal to or greater than the rate claimed, and that I have met the requirements as prescribed by SAM Sections 0750, 0751, 0752, 0753 and 0754 pertaining to vehicle safety and seatbelt usage. And it is no accident that Brown and Miller were asked to sign about 20 copies of each form. This is a page from the CalPERS Board Manual: As the images show, the Board Services Unit instructs board members sign undated forms in blank, with the body of the form, including critically, the certification language removed.1 Staff prints the rest of the form, including the missing certification language, into the pre-signed document when they also fill in expense information and submit it on behalf of the board member… The implication of the institutionalized practice of: 1) using pre-signed partial forms, 2) using them to fabricate documents that are falsely submitted as complete originals, and 3) using them as the basis for making of payment is that the current Board President, Priya Mathur, her predecessor, Rob Feckner, and members of the Board Services Unit have suborned board members to provide false certifications on an ongoing basis. In addition, both the pre-signing of the travel claim forms and the submission of the false certifications is criminal conduct. Per Title 12 OF CRIMES AGAINST THE REVENUE AND PROPERTY OF THIS STATE, Section 424: (a) Each officer of this state, or of any county, city, town, or district of this state, and every other person charged with the receipt, safekeeping, transfer, or disbursement of public moneys, who either: 3. Knowingly keeps any false account, or makes any false entry or erasure in any account of or relating to the same; or, 4. Fraudulently alters, falsifies, conceals, destroys, or obliterates any account; Section 424(a)3 is colloquially called the “misappropriation of public funds” statute. Merely providing a “false account,” as in false certifications or doctored records, is a crime in and of itself. In addition, Chapter 8 of the California Government Code makes conspiracy a crime, and defines it broadly in Section 182: (a) If two or more persons conspire: (1) To commit any crime. This means that not only have the “officers of the state” meaning Board Presidents Mathur and Feckner, along with any board members who pre-signed travel expense forms, apparently misappropriated public funds as defined under the law, but they and the members of the Board Services Unit who prepared and submitted the forms also look to have committed an additional felony, that of conspiracy. Summarizing from this detailed post: Brown voiced her concern about this practice to a board member who was also an attorney, who confirmed that no one should ever sign a blank form. Matt Jacobs overheard the discussion, said it was improper and needed to stop, and said he would speak to Board President Priya Mathur about it. Whatever Jacobs said to Mathur was apparently unserious. Rather than Mathur halting the practice and telling board members pronto that new procedures were to be implemented, Mathur scheduled a call with Brown. Brown e-mailed Mathur and told her about the practice and why she was concerned about it. Mathur replied by e-mail she would look into it and get back to Brown. As we described in the post, Brown did not hear back and there was no evidence any corrective action was taken at the time our post ran, months later. So Jacobs couldn’t be bothered to pressure Mathur to fix something so obviously improper yet easy to remedy. This incident may help readers will understand the disgust with which I view his, Marcie Frost, and many other board members’ lazy, corrupt, and self-serving conduct. And a favorite with some, CalPERS General Counsel Matt Jacobs Violated “Zero Tolerance” Policy via Manhandling CEO Marcie Frost; Will CalPERS Sanction Jacobs or Change the Policy?: As much as we enjoy mining the seemingly bottomless vein of misconduct at CalPERS, we feel compelled to commemorate an incident from last week’s offsite because it so deeply offended the people who saw it live — many of them CalPERS beneficiaries who are retired after decades of honorable government service. This incident, of General Counsel Matt Jacobs literally draping himself over CEO Marcie Frost’s shoulders for a long tete-a-tete, was a cut-and-dried violation of CalPERS’ Harassment, Discrimination, and Retaliation Prevention Policy. It epitomizes CalPERS’ hypocritical and two-faced posture toward board members and senior staff, by which members of the power faction are never held to account or even criticized. By contrast, those who are seeking to clean up CalPERS’ misconduct and incompetence are often severely sanctioned, in ways designed to interfere with the performance of their fiduciary duties.1 …Reports from a half dozen independent sources show that these witnesses were appalled. In fact, the degree of upset was what led one observer to take the pictures above, noting: Matt ❤️ Marcie. CalPERS Santa Rosa off-site. I was a little slow with my camera, so I missed the minutes-long embrace from the other side — because I couldn’t believe that this was actually happening. I was sitting with a woman from XXX and a woman from YYY who both attend SCORE. There was a third woman who I had just met that day who was a [former government job]. They were freaking-out. It started looking like a casual huddle to whisper, but it lingered on-and-on to the point that the women were saying, “Somebody take a picture, this is completely inappropriate!” Jacobs had draped himself over both of Frost’s shoulders with his left arm, his hand casually cupping one of them. I couldn’t tell if it was a “power move” to dominate her or if there was some sort of creepy mutual cuddle-thing going on, because I couldn’t see their faces. He’s huge and she’s tiny; which made the whole incident even creepier from the peanut gallery. Just a horrible “look” smack in front of a group of retired female shop-stewards. There’s also still a soupçon of salaciousness. Other reactions, each from additional sources: Audience Member 1: Attorney Mr Jacobs went to CEO Ms. Marcie Frost and proceeded to put his arm around her shoulders to have a private conversation, he then went to board President Mr. Jones and CEO Ms. Frost and repeated this act from the other side. During this interaction the previously mentioned board member [Theresa Taylor] glanced at this interaction and said nothing. I found the interaction as unacceptable staff interaction and the non action of the board member as conflicting…Persons seated near me commented that the interaction appeared to be inappropriate contact between supervisor and subordinate. Audience Member 2: His behavior was unsettling. I don’t know if he was being controlling or sexual towards little Marcie but it was unprofessional at best and sexual at worst. Audience Member 3: It wasn’t appropriate For a staff member and his boss. It was sexual harassment. Audience Member 4: It was gross. It looked like it could have been sexual but I doubt that. It reminded me more of a big dog we had. He’d put his paw on other dogs to show he was the boss. It is noteworthy that most of the individuals above were older women. Generally speaking, older women grew up in an era where sexual banter and flirting in the workplace were seen as acceptable within bounds. The fact that women of this age group were deeply disturbed suggests that young women would have been even more upset. But as the last comment made explicit, they were disturbed by the power dynamic. By putting his hands on Frost and keeping them there, Jacobs was making a big and very public display of his dominance. The State of California and many government bodies in the state trust CalPERS to handle their money, when most candy stores are better managed. While we can lay a lot of blame for the terrible controls, disregard for the law, and persistent preference for cover-ups rather than clean-ups, the buck ultimately stops with Governor Gavin Newsom. If he’s serious about a Presidential bid in 2028, it would behove him to shake up CalPERS lest some big creepie crawlies emerge during his campaign. Another shocking exposé on these criminal clowns, but just a heads up Yves that your internal links in this piece are broken (unless a user has WordPress admin access at NC) Oh, hell, it will be a huge process to fix them manually. But I am on to it. Just logging off for the night so just a quick comment. It has not escaped my notice of the colour of those postal notes saying ‘signature only please. no date.’ Just sayin’. But now the real fun and games start. CalPERs choosing somebody to fill Jacob’s shoes. Like with Meng, that have had some spectacular fiascos in choosing new people that would be amenable to the, ahem, mysteries ways of CalPERS. I look forward to the resulting posts on what they do. I would not trust Governor Gavin Newsom to do anything effective in reforming CalPERS. At best he will be theatrical, saying all the right words because he is connected to all the corruption in all levels of California’s government. As a mediocre white-collar criminal defense attorney tasked with advising the largest public pension trust fund in the country, Jacobs brought a mix of willful ignorance of the law and a stubborn obsession to run roughshod over it in order to push money out the door to the “right people,” no matter the terms. He is emblematic of an over-subscribed legal profession in which lawyers simply bloviate their “opinions” to clients without reference to fact, statutory, or decisional law. Newsom would be wise to pressure his factotums on the CalPERS Board of Administration to appoint a new General Counsel who understands the fiduciary obligations of a pension trust. The mis-doings at CalPERS are about to blow up in his face and it will be a better look for him to fix them (and blame his predecessors) than to persist in trying to cover them up… My understanding is that the CalPers Board are not direct state employees. Their pay is quite variable. Some double-dip. some don’t. Here’s a 2014 article on CalPers by the SacBee newspaper: https://www.sacbee.com/news/investigations/the-public-eye/article4071012.html The article is quite long and you’ll discover why the ‘undated’ travel/expense forms are so useful. This has NOTHING to do with what David in Friday Harbor said and comes off as an unwarranted correction/reprimand. And what they get paid or not paid similarly has nada to do with their legal obligation to handle expenses or board matters generally in accordance with the law. Some are automatically on the board as state officers, namely the state Treasurer. and Comptroller. Others are appointed from different candidates for particular seats by the Governor or legislature. Six seats are elected. One seat is for retirees and so is not a current employee and receives only a modest stipend. Ditto the ex-officio members and the gubernatorial and legislative appointees Of the elected seats, the ones that are currently employed do not quit their jobs to serve on the CalPERS board. They instead get “relief time”, as an a reduction of hours while still receiving full pay, to allow for time spent at CalPERS The issue is that they are all state officers in their capacity as CalPERS board members and subject to various state laws related to that status. Oh, but it does. If the CalPERS Board were direct state employees then Newsom would have real pressure to bear. I understand the Board is a mix of appointed and elected ‘officials’. The SacBee article explains that and identifies why Jacobs would seek undated reimbursement forms—to assist some of the Board members to game the reimbursement system and increase payment for their time working on Board matters. As the article explains, a Cal State Univ. professor was claiming reimbursement for $50K per semester (15 weeks) while actually not teaching anything anywhere. The undated travel claims were likely in service to this particular Board members reimbursement charade. Please stop Making Shit Up. You are way way out of your depth here. Newsom has ample power over CalPERS and its board. He could for starters threaten to prosecute them for felonies over the unsigned expense forms. He could force Marcie Frost’s resignation on any one of a number of abuses (see our archives). The expense forms have NOTHING to do with relief time. That is set based on the # of board meetings and assumptions re prep time for them (if you do your job, there is a lot of material to review before a board meeting). Some employers do wind up taking employees who win CalPERS board seats off all their regular day-job work because it is too difficult to manage the relief time demands and the board meeting schedule and still have them be productive. I know of a former board member who was tortured early in his 8 year tenure as a CalPERS board member by effectively being made to do all of his regular duties in his non-CalPERS time, then they threw up their hands and stopped asking him to work at his official job (my dim recollection is that he was expected to turn up now and again for appearances’ sake). It was just too hard for him to be a useful contributor in his role on a part-time basis. That is the employer’s decision, not CalPERS’ decision. And you are further wrong about Newsom’s power over the state employees as state workers. Once they get past the one year probation period, they are very very hard to fire and have strong due process and appeal rights. Yves is quite correct here. The governor directly appoints and controls four members of the CalPERS Board, who effectively serve at his pleasure. A fifth is appointed by the President of the State Senate, which in a one-party state gives the governor great influence if the Senate wants bills signed. The two ex-officio members are the State Treasurer and the State Controller who are quite beholden to the governor. That is a majority of the Board. But more importantly, public opinion will hold the governor responsible for failures at the pension. There has been a lot of tension between the governor and the Board since Newsom’s predecessor Jerry Brown rammed the PEPRA pension reform through the State Legislature back in 2013. PEPRA reduced retirement formulas, increased retirement ages, reduced and capped what counted as compensation, increased contributions, and capped high-earners. Brown’s predecessors Davis and Schwarzenegger had been more laissez-faire toward high fees and kick-backs than Brown was and the criminal case against the CEO and ex-Board member brought things to a head. In the same time-frame CalPERS pulled-out of Hedge Funds entirely, and it appears that high fees to Private Equity and Real Estate were a sop to those who had been living off the grift. Unfortunately things have gotten out of control again and Mr. Newsom would be wise to tamp-down on the grifting if he doesn’t want it getting on him. CalPERS currently pays nearly triple the fees as CalSTRS across the river does as a percentage of AUM, for lower rates of return. Not a good look. BTW, I wouldn’t trust anything that the Bee says about CalPERS. They’re owned by Chatham Asset Management and regularly kill stories and letters critical of PE. Great post! But it also re-raises the question I always ask myself. Namely with so much money being so poorly managed by a state organization over so many years why is this still ongoing and has not been cleaned up? I can’t help but think that someone benefits by CalPERS being such a mess, but haven’t a clue who they might be or why (besides greed). Any ideas? The main beneficiaries are the Congressional Democrats led by Nancy Pelosi and now Adam Schiff — who live off the largesse of high-fee Private Equity and Real Estate managers (even though the GOP probably gets more money from them) — the California Democrats and public employee unions — who are relieved of fundraising obligations to the DCCC and the DNC as a “behestment” for CalPERS high-fee largesse — and the unions who see high PE and RE fees as a “Stockholm Syndrome” buy-off that prevents Stanford’s Joe Nation from running a ballot initiative to switch CalPERS to a Pinochet/Thatcher style defined-contribution system. Jacobs was a protegé of Barbara Boxer, the former U.S. Senator from Brooklyn via Marin County, who made it her mission to recognize Tribes so that they could open flashy casino gambling dens up and down the Golden State — with clumsy kick-backs to her ne’er-do-well son Doug. Apparently Jacobs’ one job was to keep the money flowing out the door of CalPERS to the “right” people. If you the compare PE and RE management fees that CalPERS pays with the same fees paid by the teachers pension across the river at CalSTRS, you will find that CalPERS pays nearly TRIPLE in fees as a percentage of AUM while generating slightly lower returns. This amounts to over a BILLION dollars every year in excess fees over the decade of Jacobs’ tenure that aren’t being invested to grow the trust fund. Maybe I have a soft spot for Barbara Boxer as she voted against the AUMF in Iraq while the other CA senator at the time, Feinstein voted for it. But I want to post in Boxer’s defense. As I recall, as I live in the Sonoma County area, Boxer pushed to recognize the defunct tribe that eventually built the Graton Casino (about 8 miles away from where I’m writing this) but Boxer had that the tribe would NOT be allowed to do gambling. Her son did lobby for the tribe after the bill passed. From https://indianz.com/IndianGaming/2010/022426.asp “Update III: The Hill has determined that their portion of the story has serious factual problems, and was not properly researched. For instance, Boxer did not change the bill to allow gaming; her version of the bill continued the House prohibition on it.” Here’s an update about Doug Boxer and his attempted shake-down of the Graton Band: https://consortiumnews.com/2018/11/16/national-exclusive-former-sen-barbara-boxers-son-and-california-powerbroker-found-bilking-indian-tribe/ Crass money-grubbers, if you ask me — even if Boxer did come up through the anti-war movement. CalPERS’s troubles are all about the skim by the politicals. The Repubs were even worse… Well, thanks for reminding us of all the illegal advice that crook Jacobs brought to CalPERS over a decade ago. Jacobs never gave the Board legal advice, it was legal cover. Matt Jacobs is an expert at justifying the unjustifiable. I remember when Bill Slaton at a public meeting accused me of “clear violations of fiduciary duty” and “disregard for confidentiality of materials or decisions reviewed or made by the Board.” He could not come up with any examples. However, a month latter Matt Jacobs came up with charges for him. Matt Jacobs labeled his report “Attorney Client Privileged” so I could not even disclose them nor get my requested public hearing. I still say they are without merit. It’s worth noting, at my Kangaroo court, Mr. Slaton couldn’t defend “his” charges because he said he only knew what Jacobs had written. It’s also noteworthy that Marcie Frost was given a copy but no Board members were given copies even when they asked. Mr. Jacobs advised the Board that the statutory requirement that security transactions by the staff on behalf of the system be made public was satisfied by reporting the dollar value of transactions by asset class. California law requires that before a state body discusses litigation in closed session “the state body shall state the title of, or otherwise specifically identify, the litigation to be discussed …” Mr. Jacobs says “General Counsel’s Update on Pending Litigation” satisfies that requirement. Mr. Jacobs seems to forget that as a government attorney he has an obligation to the public. I am not sorry to see him go and hope he enjoys his retirement. Meanwhile, over at UC: University of California fund ditches hedge funds with scathing rebuke “Hedge funds are a fantastic business if you’re on Wall Street, and you can charge a great fee and then you can afford to buy all the art and the private jets and the amazing houses in the world,” he said. He added: “My only regret is not the fact that we haven’t invested in hedge funds, it’s that I’m not a hedge fund manager.” https://archive.li/MK7fV CalPERS got out of hedge funds in 2014. We deemed that to be 8 years late: https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2006/12/fools-and-their-money-hedge-fund.html Note that University of California system != Cal State System, with only the latter being part of CalPERS. UC = prestige operation/where the nobel prizes happen No, UC has its own pension system. Similarly, California school teachers have their own system, CalSTRS. But non-teacher school employees like administrators and bus drivers are in CalPERS. Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Comment * Name * Email * SUBSCRIPTIONS

Title: Geopolitical Risks Force Family Offices Into Liquid Alternatives, Cash

Time Published: 2025-07-18T13:36:01Z

Geopolitical uncertainties are forcing family offices out of U.S. equities, diversifying into cash and liquid alternatives, according to BlackRock’s annual Global Family Office Survey. Global family offices find themselves in “risk-management mode,” as 68% reported scrambling to diversify their assets. Some 84% of respondents said geopolitical uncertainty is the most important issue for them and is a critical factor in their capital allocation decisions. Alternatives are benefiting from increased allocations and now make up 42% of single-family office portfolios, up from 39% in 2022, according to the data. For more stories like this, sign up for the CIO Alert newsletter.  Private credit and infrastructure are the most-favored alternatives. In addition, 32% of family offices reported plans to increase their allocations to private credit, and 30% said they intend to raise their infrastructure allocation in2025-26. Infrastructure is also gaining strong momentum, with 75% of respondents reporting they feel positive about the prospects for the asset class. Armando Senra, BlackRock’s head of institutional business in the Americas, said with 60% of family offices pessimistic about the global outlook, confidence has been further shaken by new U.S. tariffs. “Family offices are now prioritizing diversification, liquidity, and structural reassessment of risk as they build resilience in their investment portfolios,” he said in a statement. Many of the 175 single-family offices surveyed, which collectively have $320 billion in assets, want to collaborate with external partners, especially when it comes to private markets. Many cited gaps in their internal expertise on reporting (57%), deal-sourcing (63%) and private-market analytics (75%). Almost one-quarter (22%) reported using an outsourced chief investment officer or would consider doing so. The majority of respondents said they would also consider using artificial intelligence for a variety of tasks from risk management to cash-flow modelling. Finally, 45% reported being more likely to invest in technology firms building AI solutions, while 51% said they were interested in investment opportunities they believe will benefit from the growth in AI, and 33% reported planning to deploy AI tech internally to improve their investing process.

Title: Ethereum ETF Evolution: BlackRock Aims To Boost ETHA Returns With Proposed ETH Staking
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-etf-evolution/
Time Published: 2025-07-18T13:00:42Z
Full Content:
Spot Ethereum ETFs could be gearing up for a notable shift as crucial efforts are being made constantly to include ETH staking into the exchange products. At the forefront of this key advancement in the ETH spot ETFs is BlackRock, which has recently taken steps to bring this idea into reality. As the Ethereum Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) gain momentum in the crypto sector, BlackRock has taken a bold step to enhance its exchange fund. The largest asset management company has recently filed for an application to add ETH staking in its iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA). This move was highlighted in the amended 19b-4 filing submitted by Nasdaq to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Thursday. Such a move would allow BlackRock’s fund to use Ethereum’s proof-of-stake mechanism to increase returns for investors. Thus, the exchange fund could earn rewards by confirming transactions on the ETH network. BlackRock’s action toward integrating staking in its ETHA marks a pivotal moment for the asset manager and its fund, redefining crypto investment. Should this application get a green light from the US SEC, it is likely to pave the way for a new era of cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds that combine decentralized financial mechanisms with conventional accessibility. According to TerraNewsEN on the social media platform X, “staking in Ethereum ETFs is not new.” In the X post, the informative platform noted that BlackRock and the US SEC have already discussed this move before the asset manager took a decisive step to submit an application. With positive news swelling around Ethereum, the platform is confident that BlackRock‘s demand for staking will yield promising results, particularly in terms of price. “BlackRock did not acquire ETH for nothing,” the platform added. While ETH rose to $3,600 mark following the news, TerraNewsEN has highlighted $4,200 as the next critical level for the altcoin to reclaim. If the asset surpasses the $4,200 level, the platform anticipates a massive rally to a new all-time high of $5,000 and beyond. Another exciting news concerning Ethereum that is making headlines in the crypto landscape is GameStop’s latest attempt to acquire more ETH into its treasury. Filing Tracker reported that the leading retail gaming company could be on the verge of purchasing ETH worth over $70 million. It is worth noting that the $70 million was generated from a public offering where the firm sold about 46,666,667 shares of common stock at a price of $1.50 each. The report shows that this move is supported by GameStop’s strategic partnership with Dialectic, a leading crypto native capital management and yield generation.

XRP price today soared to $3.48, rising nearly 7%, after the U.S. House passed major crypto bills and corporations like VivoPower and Webus announced $421 million in XRP holdings. Whale wallets added a massive $7.1 billion, boosting confidence among retail and institutional investors. With support from Trump-era crypto momentum and bullish technicals, analysts now predict XRP could hit $5 soon—and possibly reach $10 if this trend continues. The rally follows XRP breaking its 2018 all-time high, signaling strong demand and growing use cases. Investors are watching closely as XRP enters a new phase of explosive price discovery in 2025.
