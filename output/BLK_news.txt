Posted on 12/21/2024 10:43:47 AM PST by george76 Not soon after the general election, and within two weeks of each other, two major financial institutions have left a United Nations Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA). This is after they joined three years ago, pledging to require environmental social governance standards (ESG) across their platforms, products and systems. According to the "bank-led and UN-convened" NZBA, global banks joined the alliance, pledging to align their lending, investment, and capital markets activities with a net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, NZBA explains. Since April 2021, 145 banks in 44 countries with more than $73 trillion in assets have joined NZBA, tripling membership in three years. "In April 2021 when NZBA launched, no bank had set a science-based sectoral 2030 target for its financed emissions using 1.5°C scenarios," it says. "Today, over half of NZBA banks have set such targets." There are two less on the list. Goldman Sachs was the first to withdraw from the alliance this month, ESG Today reported. Wells Fargo was the second, announcing its departure Friday. The banks withdrew two years after 19 state attorneys general launched an investigation into them and four other institutions, Bank of America, Citigroup, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley, for alleged deceptive trade practices connected to ESG. Four states led the investigation: Arizona, Kentucky, Missouri and Texas. Others involved include Arkansas, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Virginia. Five state investigations aren't public for confidentiality reasons. The investigation was the third launched by Texas AG Ken Paxton into deceptive trade practices connected to ESG, which he argues were designed to negatively impact the Texas oil and natural gas industry. The industry is the lifeblood of the Texas economy and major economic engine for the country and world, The Center Square has reported. The Texas oil and natural gas industry accounts for nearly one-third of Texas's GDP and funds more than 10% of the state's budget. It generates over 43% of the electricity in the U.S. and 51% in Texas, according to 2023 data from the Energy Information Administration. It continues to break production records, emissions reduction records and job creation records, leading the nation in all three categories, The Center Square reported.Last year, the industry paid the largest amount in tax revenue in state history of more than $26.3 billion.This translated to $72 million a day to fund public schools, universities, roads, first responders and other services. "The radical climate change movement has been waging an all-out war against American energy for years, and the last thing Americans need right now are corporate activists helping the left bankrupt our fossil fuel industry," Paxton said in 2022 when launching Texas' investigation. "If the largest banks in the world think they can get away with lying to consumers or taking any other illegal action designed to target a vital American industry like energy, they're dead wrong. This investigation is just getting started, and we won't stop until we get to the truth."' Paxton praised Wells Fargo's move to withdraw from "an anti-energy activist organization that requires its members to prioritize a radical climate agenda over consumer and investor interests." Under Texas law, financial institutions that boycott the oil and natural gas industry are prohibited from entering into contracts with state governmental entities. State law also requires state entities to divest from financial companies that boycott the oil and natural gas industry by implementing ESG policies. To date, 17 companies and 353 publicly traded investment funds are on Texas' ESG divestment list. After financial institutions withdraw from the NZBA, they are permitted to do business with Texas, Paxton said. He also urged other financial institutions to follow suit and "end ESG policies that are hostile to our critical oil and gas industries." Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar has expressed skepticism about companies claiming to withdraw from ESG commitments noting there is often doublespeak in their announcements, The Center Square reported. Notably, when leaving the alliance, a Goldman Sachs spokesperson said the company was still committed to the NZBA goals and has "the capabilities to achieve our goals and to support the sustainability objectives of our clients," EST Today reported. The company also said it was "very focused on the increasingly elevated sustainability standards and reporting requirements imposed by regulators around the world." "Goldman Sachs also confirmed that its goal to align its financing activities with net zero by 2050, and its interim sector-specific targets remained in place," EST Today reported. Five Goldman Sachs funds are listed in Texas' ESG divestment list. The Comptroller's office remains committed to "enforcing the laws of our state as passed by the Texas Legislature," Hegar said. "Texas tax dollars should not be invested in a manner that undermines our state's economy or threatens key Texas industries and jobs."

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Since April 2021, 145 banks in 44 countries with more than $73 trillion in assets have joined NZBA, tripling membership in three years. "In April 2021 when NZBA launched, no bank had set a science-based sectoral 2030 target for its financed emissions using 1.5°C scenarios," it says. "Today, over half of NZBA banks have set such targets." There are two less on the list. Goldman Sachs was the first to withdraw from the alliance this month, ESG Today reported. Wells Fargo was the second, announcing its departure Friday. The banks withdrew two years after 19 state attorneys general launched an investigation into them and four other institutions, Bank of America, Citigroup, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley, for alleged deceptive trade practices connected to ESG. Four states led the investigation: Arizona, Kentucky, Missouri and Texas. Others involved include Arkansas, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Virginia. Five state investigations aren't public for confidentiality reasons. The investigation was the third launched by Texas AG Ken Paxton into deceptive trade practices connected to ESG, which he argues were designed to negatively impact the Texas oil and natural gas industry. The industry is the lifeblood of the Texas economy and major economic engine for the country and world, The Center Square has reported. The Texas oil and natural gas industry accounts for nearly one-third of Texas's GDP and funds more than 10% of the state's budget. It generates over 43% of the electricity in the U.S. and 51% in Texas, according to 2023 data from the Energy Information Administration. It continues to break production records, emissions reduction records and job creation records, leading the nation in all three categories, The Center Square reported.Last year, the industry paid the largest amount in tax revenue in state history of more than $26.3 billion.This translated to $72 million a day to fund public schools, universities, roads, first responders and other services. "The radical climate change movement has been waging an all-out war against American energy for years, and the last thing Americans need right now are corporate activists helping the left bankrupt our fossil fuel industry," Paxton said in 2022 when launching Texas' investigation. "If the largest banks in the world think they can get away with lying to consumers or taking any other illegal action designed to target a vital American industry like energy, they're dead wrong. This investigation is just getting started, and we won't stop until we get to the truth."' Paxton praised Wells Fargo's move to withdraw from "an anti-energy activist organization that requires its members to prioritize a radical climate agenda over consumer and investor interests." Under Texas law, financial institutions that boycott the oil and natural gas industry are prohibited from entering into contracts with state governmental entities. State law also requires state entities to divest from financial companies that boycott the oil and natural gas industry by implementing ESG policies. To date, 17 companies and 353 publicly traded investment funds are on Texas' ESG divestment list. After financial institutions withdraw from the NZBA, they are permitted to do business with Texas, Paxton said. He also urged other financial institutions to follow suit and "end ESG policies that are hostile to our critical oil and gas industries." Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar has expressed skepticism about companies claiming to withdraw from ESG commitments noting there is often doublespeak in their announcements, The Center Square reported. Notably, when leaving the alliance, a Goldman Sachs spokesperson said the company was still committed to the NZBA goals and has "the capabilities to achieve our goals and to support the sustainability objectives of our clients," EST Today reported. The company also said it was "very focused on the increasingly elevated sustainability standards and reporting requirements imposed by regulators around the world." "Goldman Sachs also confirmed that its goal to align its financing activities with net zero by 2050, and its interim sector-specific targets remained in place," EST Today reported. Five Goldman Sachs funds are listed in Texas' ESG divestment list. The Comptroller's office remains committed to "enforcing the laws of our state as passed by the Texas Legislature," Hegar said. "Texas tax dollars should not be invested in a manner that undermines our state's economy or threatens key Texas industries and jobs."

Wells Fargo was the second, announcing its departure Friday. The banks withdrew two years after 19 state attorneys general launched an investigation into them and four other institutions, Bank of America, Citigroup, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley, for alleged deceptive trade practices connected to ESG. Four states led the investigation: Arizona, Kentucky, Missouri and Texas. Others involved include Arkansas, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Virginia. Five state investigations aren't public for confidentiality reasons. The investigation was the third launched by Texas AG Ken Paxton into deceptive trade practices connected to ESG, which he argues were designed to negatively impact the Texas oil and natural gas industry. The industry is the lifeblood of the Texas economy and major economic engine for the country and world, The Center Square has reported. The Texas oil and natural gas industry accounts for nearly one-third of Texas's GDP and funds more than 10% of the state's budget. It generates over 43% of the electricity in the U.S. and 51% in Texas, according to 2023 data from the Energy Information Administration. It continues to break production records, emissions reduction records and job creation records, leading the nation in all three categories, The Center Square reported.Last year, the industry paid the largest amount in tax revenue in state history of more than $26.3 billion.This translated to $72 million a day to fund public schools, universities, roads, first responders and other services. "The radical climate change movement has been waging an all-out war against American energy for years, and the last thing Americans need right now are corporate activists helping the left bankrupt our fossil fuel industry," Paxton said in 2022 when launching Texas' investigation. "If the largest banks in the world think they can get away with lying to consumers or taking any other illegal action designed to target a vital American industry like energy, they're dead wrong. This investigation is just getting started, and we won't stop until we get to the truth."' Paxton praised Wells Fargo's move to withdraw from "an anti-energy activist organization that requires its members to prioritize a radical climate agenda over consumer and investor interests." Under Texas law, financial institutions that boycott the oil and natural gas industry are prohibited from entering into contracts with state governmental entities. State law also requires state entities to divest from financial companies that boycott the oil and natural gas industry by implementing ESG policies. To date, 17 companies and 353 publicly traded investment funds are on Texas' ESG divestment list. After financial institutions withdraw from the NZBA, they are permitted to do business with Texas, Paxton said. He also urged other financial institutions to follow suit and "end ESG policies that are hostile to our critical oil and gas industries." Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar has expressed skepticism about companies claiming to withdraw from ESG commitments noting there is often doublespeak in their announcements, The Center Square reported. Notably, when leaving the alliance, a Goldman Sachs spokesperson said the company was still committed to the NZBA goals and has "the capabilities to achieve our goals and to support the sustainability objectives of our clients," EST Today reported. The company also said it was "very focused on the increasingly elevated sustainability standards and reporting requirements imposed by regulators around the world." "Goldman Sachs also confirmed that its goal to align its financing activities with net zero by 2050, and its interim sector-specific targets remained in place," EST Today reported. Five Goldman Sachs funds are listed in Texas' ESG divestment list. The Comptroller's office remains committed to "enforcing the laws of our state as passed by the Texas Legislature," Hegar said. "Texas tax dollars should not be invested in a manner that undermines our state's economy or threatens key Texas industries and jobs."

Under Texas law, financial institutions that boycott the oil and natural gas industry are prohibited from entering into contracts with state governmental entities. State law also requires state entities to divest from financial companies that boycott the oil and natural gas industry by implementing ESG policies. To date, 17 companies and 353 publicly traded investment funds are on Texas' ESG divestment list. After financial institutions withdraw from the NZBA, they are permitted to do business with Texas, Paxton said. He also urged other financial institutions to follow suit and "end ESG policies that are hostile to our critical oil and gas industries." Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar has expressed skepticism about companies claiming to withdraw from ESG commitments noting there is often doublespeak in their announcements, The Center Square reported. Notably, when leaving the alliance, a Goldman Sachs spokesperson said the company was still committed to the NZBA goals and has "the capabilities to achieve our goals and to support the sustainability objectives of our clients," EST Today reported. The company also said it was "very focused on the increasingly elevated sustainability standards and reporting requirements imposed by regulators around the world." "Goldman Sachs also confirmed that its goal to align its financing activities with net zero by 2050, and its interim sector-specific targets remained in place," EST Today reported. Five Goldman Sachs funds are listed in Texas' ESG divestment list. The Comptroller's office remains committed to "enforcing the laws of our state as passed by the Texas Legislature," Hegar said. "Texas tax dollars should not be invested in a manner that undermines our state's economy or threatens key Texas industries and jobs."

"If the largest banks in the world think they can get away with lying to consumers or taking any other illegal action designed to target a vital American industry like energy, they're dead wrong. This investigation is just getting started, and we won't stop until we get to the truth."' Paxton praised Wells Fargo's move to withdraw from "an anti-energy activist organization that requires its members to prioritize a radical climate agenda over consumer and investor interests." Under Texas law, financial institutions that boycott the oil and natural gas industry are prohibited from entering into contracts with state governmental entities. State law also requires state entities to divest from financial companies that boycott the oil and natural gas industry by implementing ESG policies. To date, 17 companies and 353 publicly traded investment funds are on Texas' ESG divestment list. After financial institutions withdraw from the NZBA, they are permitted to do business with Texas, Paxton said. He also urged other financial institutions to follow suit and "end ESG policies that are hostile to our critical oil and gas industries." Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar has expressed skepticism about companies claiming to withdraw from ESG commitments noting there is often doublespeak in their announcements, The Center Square reported. Notably, when leaving the alliance, a Goldman Sachs spokesperson said the company was still committed to the NZBA goals and has "the capabilities to achieve our goals and to support the sustainability objectives of our clients," EST Today reported. The company also said it was "very focused on the increasingly elevated sustainability standards and reporting requirements imposed by regulators around the world." "Goldman Sachs also confirmed that its goal to align its financing activities with net zero by 2050, and its interim sector-specific targets remained in place," EST Today reported. Five Goldman Sachs funds are listed in Texas' ESG divestment list. The Comptroller's office remains committed to "enforcing the laws of our state as passed by the Texas Legislature," Hegar said. "Texas tax dollars should not be invested in a manner that undermines our state's economy or threatens key Texas industries and jobs."

Notably, when leaving the alliance, a Goldman Sachs spokesperson said the company was still committed to the NZBA goals and has "the capabilities to achieve our goals and to support the sustainability objectives of our clients," EST Today reported. The company also said it was "very focused on the increasingly elevated sustainability standards and reporting requirements imposed by regulators around the world." "Goldman Sachs also confirmed that its goal to align its financing activities with net zero by 2050, and its interim sector-specific targets remained in place," EST Today reported. Five Goldman Sachs funds are listed in Texas' ESG divestment list. The Comptroller's office remains committed to "enforcing the laws of our state as passed by the Texas Legislature," Hegar said.

UN Agenda 21 , 2030 , Great Reset, ( Let me know if you wish to be added or removed from the list.) This is a good indication that the Globalists are steadily losing ground. And Donald Trump not being a Globalist probably had something/a lot to do with it. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said he is no longer using the term “ESG” (environment, social and governance) because it is politically weaponized and he is ashamed to be part of the debate on the issue. Ron DeSantis’ decision to pull $2 billion in assets hurt his firm in 2022, but.. https://freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/4163518/posts Larry Fink is not disavowing ESG. He is disavowing using the name. Trump re-election is a major factor. MAGA is diagonally opposite of globalism. Great Reset -> Great Face Plant Great to see Wells Fargo sees clearly. Maybe he will call it what it really is: Reverse Discrimination Right - same with DIE, they’re dropping the term but still ramrodding it everywhere. The idiotic powers that be who managed the investment part of the Kalifornia CalPers retirement fund tried this years before the term ESG was used. Since more and more Kalifornians retire each year, the Fund needs do just one thing.... GROW. Once the Board overseeing the idiots got wind to the insanity, they gave them an ultimatum - go back to WHATEVER has the best return on investment, or go find another job. You are correct. They stopped using the term[name]. However, they will just rename the Programs and continue on. Why doesn’t BlackRock CEO Larry Fink just follow the mission statement of US Constitution vs the crap of ESG which is discriminatory? NOTE TO SELF: Close out that BOA acct.

Title: Robert Kiyosaki: ‘Everything Bubble’ Is About To Burst — How To Prepare

In a series of tweets on Oct. 14, “Rich Dad Poor Dad” author Robert Kiyosaki warned of an impending collapse of the “everything bubble” — his term for the inflation that has not only driven up home price and costs of consumer goods, butassets such as gold, silver, bitcoin and stocks, as well. When the everything bubble bursts, Kiyosaki warned, an “everything crash” will bring suffering on the unprepared. Find Out: 10 Things the Middle Class Won’t Be Able To Afford in Less Than a Decade Read Next: The Salary Needed To Afford America’s 50 Biggest Cities Kiyosaki’s predictions are rooted in his belief that the dollar is a “fake” store of value, so consumers should invest money in appreciating assets instead of saving it in a bank account. But rather than invest in the stock market — which he also considers a fake store of value — he says physical assets like gold, silver and bitcoin are the way to go. Kiyosaki recommended buying these assets when the markets for them crash so that you can get rich when prices recover and their values appreciate. Before you sell off your stock and transfer your savings to a cryptocurrency exchange, it’s important to understand Kiyosaki’s track record when it comes to forecasting market crashes. A U.S. News & World Report analysis looked at 11 such predictions from April 2011 to May 2024, when he proclaimed, “BAD News: CRASH has BEGUN,” and found that he was incorrect 100% of the time. Even economists have trouble predicting market crashes, but there’s no denying the economy undergoes cycles. In its fourth-quarter 2024 update, Fidelity identified the U.S. as being in the latter part of the cycle, where growth slows. Sooner or later, it’ll hit a trough that could trigger a market correction. Learn More: 3 Signs You’ve ‘Made It’ Financially, According to Financial Influencer Genesis Hinckley While cashing in your stocks is probably a terrible idea that you shouldn’t consider without consulting with a financial planner and/or tax advisor, investing in gold, silver and cryptocurrency might be smart regardless of where you believe the market is headed. Precious metals like gold and silver diversify your portfolio. Gold is the stronger of the two in that regard, according to Morgan Stanley, because it’s less volatile and less sensitive to global economies. Experts generally recommend, according to CBS News, that gold comprise up to 10% of your portfolio. Cryptocurrency, and bitcoin in particular, also provide diversification. A Fidelity study found that from Aug. 1, 2010 through March 31, 2024, bitcoin returned 178% per year, on average, which far surpassed annualized returns on stocks. However, bitcoin is less of a hedge than previously thought. Rather than move opposite the market, it has tended to move in the same direction, but reach higher highs and lower lows. For a traditional portfolio with a 60%/40% mix of stocks and bonds, Blackrock recommends allocating no more than 2% to bitcoin[x].Here are more tips for preparing your finances for an “everything crash,” according to Merrill Lynch: Avoid panic selling. Your losses are paper losses only until you sell. Once your shares are gone, you have no chance to recoup your investment. Rebalance your portfolio. Over time, differences in how assets appreciate can throw your investment mix out of whack. Rebalancing restores the mix to the strategy you intended. Keep investing. Regular investing protects your portfolio through dollar-cost averaging. Over time, you’ll buy more shares at lower prices, and fewer shares when prices are up. Build an emergency fund. Granted, inflation reduces the purchasing power of cash you hold in a savings account, but the best high-yield savings accounts earn more than 4% annual percentage yield, with no risk to the cash itself. That savings can keep you from having to rely on expensive credit should you lose your job or need an expensive home or car repair. Pay down debt. Eliminating debt frees up cash you can save or invest. It also frees up your available credit for use in an emergency your savings can’t cover.

Title: Balaji Srinivasan on Bitcoin, AI: 'Going Vertical'

U.Today - Renowned tech visionary Balaji Srinivasan, former CTO of Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) and GP of Andreessen Horowitz, shows two charts to display the rocketing opportunities of AI large language models (LLMs) and Bitcoin ETFs. Both are in their "vertical" growth phases, he says. To demonstrate the traction of Bitcoin (BTC) and AI, Srinivasan shared two charts. The first one demonstrates the opportunities of OpenAI's flagship models to solve various tasks. It is measured by Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI) benchmarks. Yesterday, Dec. 20, 2024, OpenAI's much-anticipated o3 model set a new record, hitting 87.5% on ARC-AGI public data set. As demonstrated by Balaji Srinivasan, this is a 10x more powerful result compared to GPT-4o, the strongest of ChatGPT's mainstream models today. In turn, GPT-4o performs 500% better than GPT-3, the model that kickstarted the AI euphoria in 2023. The second chart by Balaji Srinivasan showcases the dynamics of USD-denominated AUM of BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) iShares ETFs on Gold and spot Bitcoin. Launched less than one year ago, BlackRock's Bitcoin spot ETFs exceeded their Gold-based predecessors by almost 73%. Bitcoin spot ETFs in the U.S. were approved Jan. 11, 2024. In total, they amassed $113 billion in AUM across 21 products. Commenting on Balaji Srinivasan's estimations, tech veteran and former Phunware CEO Alan Knitowski noticed that Bitcoin (BTC) might surpass the internet in adoption impetus. While Bitcoin (BTC) might already be growing faster than the internet, its adoption is near 1999 levels for Global Web, Knitowski's chart says. This article was originally published on U.Today

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 AI News That Broke the Internet. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) stands against other AI news that broke the Internet. As AI continues to evolve, its influence on business will be undeniable, reshaping industries with smarter, more efficient solutions. Companies that embrace these trends will be better equipped to innovate, compete, and thrive in an increasingly AI-driven world. According to Oliver Parker Vice President, Global Generative AI Go-To-Market, Google Cloud, artificial intelligence is set to significantly impact businesses in 2025, driving innovation and transforming operations. Key trends include multimodal AI, which combines text, audio, and visual data for more accurate and contextual analysis; AI agents that simplify complex workflows and support employees; improved enterprise search capabilities allowing users to access data through various media; improved customer experiences with personalized and predictive AI solutions; and stronger security systems powered by AI to detect threats and strengthen defenses. However, this progress also introduces challenges, especially in the realm of AI-driven security threats. READ ALSO: 10 Companies Hoarding Bitcoin Like There’s No Tomorrow and 9 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings. The AI landscape is undergoing a significant shift, with a growing focus on algorithmic innovations and software applications rather than just scaling hardware. As generative AI models mature, startups and smaller companies are emerging as key players, driving efficiency and new use cases in the field. In the discussion on CNBC, Chetan Puttagunta from Benchmark and Deirdre Bosa of CNBC focused on the evolving AI landscape. Chetan highlighted that AI innovation is shifting from large-scale hardware investments to algorithmic advancements, especially at the model layer, with entrepreneurs pushing the frontier in inference and AI applications. He mentioned that recent investment trends are moving toward smaller startups focused on algorithmic breakthroughs, as opposed to just scaling hardware. Deirdre added that AI’s generative phase is transitioning from pre-training large models to leveraging existing models for real-world applications. This phase is characterized by a focus on software, with smaller companies gaining traction, especially with the rise of open-source models like Llama, allowing new startups to challenge established players. Chetan gives examples like Sierra, which is revolutionizing customer service by automating tasks and improving customer experiences. Both see a significant opportunity for new AI-first startups to disrupt traditional software companies. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). An e-commerce platform displaying a wide range of products to customers online. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 115 Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) AI across several applications, including chatbots for customer service, NLP and machine learning for text analysis and model development, and advanced tools like AI translation and text-to-video creation. South China Morning Post reported that Alibaba Group has restructured its AI teams by separating the development of its chatbot, Tongyi Qianwen, from its large language model (LLM) research. The AI chatbot team will now operate under the Intelligent Information Platform, which focuses on consumer-facing products like the UC Browser and Quark search engine. Meanwhile, the LLM research division, Tongyi Lab, will remain part of Alibaba Cloud, dedicated to fundamental research and supporting specific products. This move reflects Alibaba’s efforts to boost consumer AI products and keep pace with the competitive AI market in China. Overall, BABA ranks 3rd on our list of AI news that broke the Internet. While we acknowledge the potential of BABA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than BABA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Lemonade, Inc. (LMND): A Bull Case Theory

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We came across a bullish thesis on Lemonade, Inc. (LMND) on Substack by Lorenzo Bastianelli. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on LMND. Lemonade, Inc. (LMND)'s share was trading at $38.10 as of Dec 19th. An insurance agent at their desk consulting a customer about property & casualty insurance. Lemonade (LMND) is redefining the insurance industry by prioritizing growth and maximizing gross profit over achieving the lowest loss ratio, positioning itself as an AI-driven disruptor rather than a traditional insurer. Management’s strategy focuses on scaling the business and leveraging technology to unlock efficiencies, addressing critics who point to its loss ratio and lack of profitability. This vision was at the forefront of the recent investor day, where Lemonade outlined its ambitious plan to grow in-force premium (IFP) from $1 billion to $10 billion. CEO Daniel Schreiber emphasized Lemonade’s unique foundation as a technology-first insurer, free from legacy constraints, which enables it to innovate, delight customers, and reduce costs. A key competitive advantage lies in its ability to iterate rapidly, with 50 product updates released weekly—far beyond the capabilities of traditional insurers. This technological edge has bolstered Lemonade’s brand strength, with its renters and pet insurance ranking among the most searched in their categories, achieved with minimal marketing spend. Lemonade’s innovative "synthetic agents" financing model has further fueled its growth by funding customer acquisition efficiently while preserving direct relationships with customers. This approach eliminates the drawbacks of traditional agent models, ensuring financial efficiency and customer retention. Lemonade’s superior model is evident in its ability to decouple revenue growth from operational costs, creating a scalable platform with near-zero marginal costs. Car insurance represents the cornerstone of Lemonade’s growth strategy, leveraging continuous telematics to offer real-time data-driven pricing. This approach allows for precision in rates, rewarding safe driving while dynamically adjusting for risk, and supports aggressive pricing strategies to capture market share. Coupled with cross-selling opportunities across its portfolio, Lemonade is poised to accelerate growth with car insurance as a pivotal driver. The company has maintained a 30% compound annual growth rate (CAGR), with consistent acceleration quarter-over-quarter. Management projects this momentum will lead to EBITDA profitability by 2026 and net income profitability by 2027, underpinned by AI-driven efficiencies that have kept operating expenses flat despite the business’s expansion. Schreiber underscored Lemonade’s long-term vision, prioritizing growth to maximize enterprise value. By scaling its operations, the company intends to shift the profit frontier, leveraging its technological advantage for sustained profitability. With its innovative, tech-first approach, Lemonade is well-positioned to achieve its ambitious goals, paving the way to redefine the insurance industry while delivering substantial value to shareholders. Lemonade, Inc. (LMND) is not on our list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 16 hedge fund portfolios held LMND at the end of the third quarter which was 17 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of LMND as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than LMND but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Unlock over $3,000 in NFT, web3 and crypto perks — Apply now! The bitcoin price has plummeted toward $90,000 per bitcoin, dragging the wider crypto market lower and wiping away around $500 billion worth of value from the $3.2 trillion crypto market. Bitcoin's drop of around 10% in the last 24 hours was dwarfed by ethereum and smaller, top ten cryptocurrencies—including solana and dogecoin—that crashed back by between 15% and 25%.

[+] bitcoin price and crypto market sell-off. This week, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell disappointed traders when he warned interest rates would not come down as quickly as the Fed had previously thought, reducing its planned number of cuts to just two in 2025, from four previously. 12/21 update: The bitcoin price has bounced back, climbing to within touching distance of $100,000 per bitcoin after the latest inflation data from the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) index showed a smaller than expected rise of 2.4% rise in November, just below the 2.5% estimate of economists polled by Reuters. Other major cryptocurrencies that had crashed lower, including ethereum, Ripple's XRP and dogecoin, also rebounded, with the combined market recovering around $300 billion of value as traders increase their bets on Federal Reserve interest rate cuts next year. Meanwhile, Cathie Wood, the founder of the Ark Investment Management hedge fund, reiterated her bullish bitcoin price prediction in a Bloomberg interview, forecasting that the bitcoin price will top $1 million by 2030—something that would give bitcoin a market capitalization of around $20 trillion. "[Bitcoin] is becoming even more scarce than gold," Wood said. "The difference between gold and bitcoin is, when the gold price goes up, as it has, production goes up, the rate of increase in the supply goes up—that can not happen with bitcoin." Over the next few weeks, bitcoin and crypto market watchers expect the bitcoin price to remain prone to wild swings. "In terms of what is coming over the holiday period, the first rule of bitcoin is that it is always volatile in the same way water is always wet," James Toledano, chief operating officer at Unity Wallet, said in emailed comments. "It’s behavior is always mixed and there is zero discernible pattern at the end of the year and going into the next. Sometimes the price rises in the new year and at other times it falls. So, historically, we can say that bitcoin exhibits typically mixed behavior over Christmas and New Year," Toledano added, pointing to incoming U.S. president Donald Trump's January 20 inauguration as an important date to watch for the bitcoin and crypto market. "Comments from the Federal Reserve were a wake-up call," Danni Hewson, AJ Bell's head of financial analysis, said in emailed comments. "Inflation is proving sticky and tax cuts and tariffs could be a recipe for reflation. "Risk appetite has been pared back.

Title: Weekend reading: Merry Christmas everyone
URL: https://monevator.com/weekend-reading-merry-christmas-everyone/
Time Published: 2024-12-21T12:57:19Z
Full Content:
What caught my eye this week. I can’t deny the Monevator Christmas party is always a little awkward, but I look forward to it every year. It’s the anonymity that makes it tricky. Not just keeping our identities secret from the waiting staff, but also from each other. Finumus doesn’t want anybody to know who he really is, you see. But when you land your private helicopter in the pub garden it’s a bit of a giveaway. Meanwhile my false beard always gets covered in gravy. Secret Santa adds to the surreal air, but again it’s easy to guess who gave what. Did I really need The Accumulator’s slightly musky Chillbreaker now the cost-of-living crisis is over? And while Squirrel accepted her framed stock certificate of a triple-levered uranium ETF – blatantly from Finumus – with good grace, TA groaned as he unwrapped a copy of One Up On Wall Street. “Every bloody year…” he complained, warding off Peter Lynch’s stock-picking classic with a copy of Tim Hale’s Smart Money – which he carries with him everywhere to shun temptation, like a Holy cross. Lynch’s book flew back through the air at me – it’s not easy to duck when you’re sporting a three-foot long beard – and I packed it away for next year. (Stay hungry, stay frugal!) Then there are the gatecrashers. It’s nice enough when Lars shows his face for old time’s sake. And it’s heartening to see The Greybeard grown fat on his equity income trust dividends after all these years. But is that not Ermine in the corner? Plotting something with a bright-looking fellow on a dusty old Sinclair computer? When the whole of yesteryear’s Team Monevator turns up expecting brandy and mince pies, I’m afraid to say we sneak out the back door and escape via that waiting chopper. Monevator membership revenues are going quite well, but we’re not running another Studio 54 here! Talking of membership, a huge thanks to the many readers who now support this site with a few quid every month. It’s made a big difference. I was reading Ed Zitron this week on how the Internet, media, and just using a computer has been progressively ruined over the past decade, and I thought again that I’d probably have turned off Monevator if enough people hadn’t signed up to support our work. Zitron writes: As every single platform we use is desperate to juice growth from every user, everything we interact with is hyper-monetized through plugins, advertising, microtransactions and other things that constantly gnaw at the user experience. We load websites expecting them to be broken, especially on mobile, because every single website has to have 15+ different ad trackers, video ads that cover large chunks of the screen, all while demanding our email or for us to let them send us notifications. I know – of course we do some of this ourselves. We show ads to non-members on the website, and I prompt new visitors to sign-up to read us by email. We (sparingly) use affiliate links. And some of this involves the same tracking stuff we’re all exposed to on every other site on the Internet, apart from possibly Wikipedia. I suppose a few people may consider us adding a membership tier to be part of this ‘making everything worse’. Well I don’t. I love the membership tier and the purity of email. Some dwindling number of diehards will never accept that creating digital products and destinations for years on end has to be paid for somehow. But for the rest of us I prefer a model where we directly pay for things. I do it myself with other websites and newsletters. Though I accept the costs add up, and there is a limit. If you are of the grumpier persuasion, you’d probably be surprised at everything I turn down. Paid-for links to crypto, currency exchange, and loan sites. (We never sell links). Well-known companies asking us to create stealthy articles to promote their products. Lucrative guest posts by SEO firms. The long trails of clickbait ads that even old-line newspaper sites have at the end of every article these days. Again, you might say you’re looking at an advert next to these words on our website right now. All I can say is that this is the thin end of a very thick wedge. And I fight to stay at the right end. Zitron’s article turned a bit hyperbolic but I agree with most of it. However where I disagree is his broad brush claim that media sites have done all this ‘enshittification’ for vast growth and profits. In fact they’ve usually made endless compromises and degraded the experience to near-unusable levels either because they are desperate not to go bust or because they already went bust and the new owner is squeezing out whatever juice is left in the brand. The big platforms have sucked all the air and money out of the Internet, and everyone else is left to starve. We’re spoiled in the UK. We have the BBC and (whatever you think of the politics) The Guardian, two of the least-polluted free media sites left standing. But countless others have gone dark, or else it would have been better had they done so. As for independent blogs, maybe 95% of those I’ve linked to in the UK are no longer around. Honestly, I’m sometimes tempted to turn Monevator into a subscription-only newsletter and switch off the lights, too. It’s a better experience for readers and better for us. No more fighting spam each day! But we still get so many emails from new people thanking us for helping them take their first steps in investing, or from older hands for keeping them on the straight and narrow. I’ve collected several hundred of these. That folder is probably the crowning achievement of my working life. Perhaps I should have tried harder to achieve more, I guess, but anyway I’m loathe to turn off the site while we’re making a difference – however much Google is trying to kill us and others off with its endless algorithm changes. So again, if you’re signed up as a Monevator member then thank you! You make it possible for us to continue to keep 99% of the 2,000-plus articles we’ve written free to read. A portion of your subscription covers the 30 minutes or more I spend every day keeping Monevator clear of toxic links, racist and sexist comments, and bit rot. Hopefully you’re enjoying the extra member content too, of course! We’re able to go deeper in the member-only articles, especially with my active ones. And it’s very nice not to worry about search engines with them. Don’t forget you can browse all our Mavens and Moguls posts in their archives. There’s quite a few now! On the opposite tack, a few members have asked me to paywall more content. Really – I was surprised too, but I guess it reflects a desire not to be taken advantage of. Personally I feel we have the right balance with our investing-related content, but there is a chance that I will eventually make the Weekend Reading links a members-only affair. Doing these links is a service to our regular readers. Nobody stumbles across them via search. And Weekend Reading is the reading list I’d love to see each week if I wasn’t creating it myself. It takes eight to ten hours to compile each one (much of which consists of reading and rejecting articles you never see links to) but it is a labour of love. However its roots lie in that better Internet of 20 years ago. Back then we used to do ‘blog carnivals’ where blogs would link to each other to spread their traffic and credibility around. Yet besides one or two honourable exceptions – thank you Simple Living in Somerset and Abnormal Returns – almost nobody links freely now. I’ve included hundreds of links to certain blogs and had at most a couple back to us over two decades. More often zero. I get it’s harder because we’re a British site and we can be kind of nerdy. But we do have some articles that are universally worthy of linking to. Even worse, Google probably penalises us nowadays for doing what used to be the right thing and highlighting the best of the web via these links. It’s so rare to do this now that it’s potentially become an indicator of a spammy link farm. Ho hum. A halfway house would be to keep the Weekend Reading list free but for email subscribers only. So again, subscribe to the free emails if you haven’t. Finally, if you’re a member but you’re not getting the emails you expect to see, then please do drop me a line via a reply to this email (ideally) or via the contact form link top-right (risk of getting stuck in spam.) The system is not perfect, but I can always sort out problems. Ditto if you have log-in issues. (Deleting your cookies usually does the trick). Okay, that’s a lot in the weeds for a busy Christmas weekend. I try not to solicit membership too often but the reality is some people churn away (et tu Maven?) so we have to keep topping up. TLDR: please everyone sign-up as members and then we can stay classy indefinitely. Beyond that, thanks for reading us for another year. With all the competition from cat and dog TikToks and belaboured YouTube videos where someone reads out their Vanguard statement for 20 minutes for 100,000 views, we do not take our audience for granted. Nor, for that matter, the many wonderful readers who add so much value in our comments. If Monevator still has a USP in today’s universally indexing-friendly age, it’s surely in the quality of the discussions that take place beneath so many of our articles. Right, that’s us almost done for 2024. I’ll have my Moguls missive out for December but otherwise we’re taking a break until the first Saturday of the new year.

Look forward to your posting a (ID redacted) selfie from the festive works outing! ;o) Thank you for all your content in 2024 (and previous years). I would not complain if all your content was behind a paywall, however, I know you help people at the start of their investing life and may not have access to your content otherwise. Season’s Greetings, Lee. Thanks again for all your work, time and musings, and the rest of the team. 2024 has been a bit of a naff one on a personal level, but the learnings and information gained via this site have meant the financial impacts of some poor health have been cushioned. Roll on 2025. Wishing everyone a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year year. Thanks for inviting me to the party, TI! (I didn’t realise until I bit into one that the gold coins weren’t chocolate… But the crackers with stock tips instead of jokes were a nice touch.) Happy Christmas to all – and wishing the site a successful year to come! Yeah, back at you big fella. Thanks to all for all your efforts. See you next year, DV. Happy Christmas and thanks for all you do! Thanks for another great year of education and discussions. Much appreciated and hopefully long may it continue. Thank you for your excellent job. Your help was greatly appreciated during my long years of toil in the NHS to facilitate my escape act and live a life of modest luxury in the Med. Merry Christmas and looking forward to more excellent articles and links in 2025. I must say that the comments are also some of the best I have seen in any website. You have created a great community of experts around this site. Peace and goodwill to the Monevator Massive! Love monevator..long may it continue. Obs thanks for the great articles but I would also like to express my gratitude to the mostly unsung heros that are the comments posters. There are too many great ones to list but many times I’ve read a post that I would like to thank but don’t want to clog up the discussion. Here’s a nod to you all. Thanks, have a good one! And keep them coming Merry Christmas to you and all the contributors to Monevator, including the commentees. I came across this website comment via the dreaded X and thought it might be of interest to you (if this comment doesn’t end up in spam) https://www.davidbrin.com/nonfiction/proxyactivism.html But I thought it kind of describes what your members are doing by our small fee – keeping something we feel is worthwhile going and maybe changing the world for some in a small way. The Monevator community feels special, and I’m happy to form part of it. You made the right pricing choices by creating the lower entry Mavens subscription. If it was for the premium Moguls only I’d never have converted, and would feel bad for not supporting the site. Agree that comments add value to already superb content. After years of reading nowadays perhaps 2/3 of even the nerdier comments make sense to me! Happy holidays! Please keep running this site. It is such a useful resource. I know from personal experience how difficult it is – and have given up myself in my niche interest presence some time ago. Thank you for all the good work! Have a great festive time. Thanks for all the effort and articles to TI and TA. I really think you need better pseudonyms – Batman & Robin, Butch & Sundance or Delboy and Rodney possibly. Also echo the thanks to the other posters who take the time to write thoughtful, constructive and helpful posts in the main. One comment on this week’s links – the Chase 5% offer should read as “including” rather than “plus” as it is 3.5+1.5 for 6 months. I raise a glass to y’all. I really enjoyed Ed’s never forgive them link – I was recently and fairly charged as a mobile refusenik but I ain’t got nothing on Ed. It sounds like I iced my Facebook account in the nick of time earlier this year. To the old ways of intelligent human discourse rather than AI slop 😉 Another hearty thank you from me too. After *counts on fingers* about seven years of religiously logging onto your site a couple of times a week and reading almost every article (I draw the line at the nerdiest posts about bond drawdown strategies…), you’ve just persuaded me to sign up via email. I feel a bit ashamed not even being a Maven, but – and I probably shouldn’t admit this – if you put Weekend Reading behind a paywall, that would probably push me to become a paying member. Thank you, and Merry Christmas. I love coming here. Another big thank you for all the great articles (which must involve a significant amount of research and time I’m sure) and weekend reading items over the year. The comments are great to read too. All make the membership subscription extremely worthwhile. [Existential mini special, re the Garden of Forking Paths, see also comments + links at #41, 42, 44 & 45-48 (Aug 23) on DA here: https://monevator.com/weekend-reading-not-a-prayer-for-serenity/ Thank you for all your efforts this year. I too love this site and look forward to my Saturday reading. I subscribe to Pensioncraft and the FT and I would give them up before Monevator! Merry Xmas and best wishes for a successful 2025 I am sure you believe it, as having followed this site since the beginning i have never thought you into trolling, but the statement “We’re spoiled in the UK. We have the BBC and (whatever you think of the politics) The Guardian, two of the least-polluted free media sites left standing.” Is quite incredible, amid even a cursory look at how both responded to the October mass murder and rape of Jewish children and elders. Both weee found to deliberately pivoting against Jewish people. Many, many other examples exist. The Times is but one that is head and shoulders of both. Enjoy the financial info as ever, and have a great Xmas Is anyone going to mention how lucrative 2024 has been? It’s been an annus miraculus. I guess if we do that we’re guaranteed to come a cropper in 2025 Gary, The Times site isn’t free. Might be much better, but it isn’t free. Marry Christmas to TI and TA, long as this site exist. Thank you TI & TA, other contributors and regular commenters. I have only commented a couple of times before, and never in a substantive way to actual financial discussions (I have no particular financial expertise or unique experience to share). However, I am here several times a week and religiously read all the articles and comments, gaining much in the way of entertainment and education on the way. So, I do want to momentarily step out of the shadows to say “Cheers” to you all at the end of another informative, enlightening and thought provoking year. I have followed this site for many years: there is so much great, informative content, you should be proud of what you have achieved. Merry Christmas As Roberto #8 but colder and wetter in Wales.Thankyou. For this tired dad, you are the Sunday Supplement of personal finance email round-ups. I look forward to and devour the content in the same way I used to for old media. Thank you and merry Christmas Thanks for all the effort and time it takes to produce the excellent articles and resources. Merry Xmas all I understand the sentiment of not being taken advantage of but for me supporting a site that I regularly direct people to when teaching them about investing is a way of paying it forward ( i really must look into whether i could leave the day job and do financial coaching full time as its definitely the ‘find something you love enough to do for free and youll never work again’ ). The fact I feel I can afford to is in no small part down to the knowledge gained on this website. Take advantage all you want Thanks @TI and @TA for all your efforts this last year … and a big thanks to folks like @ermine and @AlCam for all their follow-up musings too. Whilst financially it’s been a good year, in all honesty I cannot wait for 2024 to be over. This site has kept me distracted from my cancer treatment (fingers crossed all sorted, now in remission) and it has been a mine of fantastic content and (mostly) great banter. Due to the work of @TA I think I’ll be cooking up a gilt-ladder or two next year – would never have approached doing this before, so thank you very much. Here’s to 2025 … bring it on ! @Rhino #22 > It’s been an annus miraculus. I confess I have made the assumption that this is simply the high recent levels of inflation rattling out, shortening the ruler against which we measure our networth. It was one of the useful points made in Rob Dix’s money book that your market holdings are a store of value outwith government manipulation of the money supply. But hey, not to look a gift horse in the mouth, wherever the uplift came from it’s better than not having it at all. Merry Christmas, and happy winter solstice all! I’m a non subscriber. I love the site. I love Weekend Reading especially. The site feels like one of the few non toxic corners left on the internet. I’m not one of the typical readers though, I don’t think. Not high earner, not high net worth. Every month finances are very tight. Monevator has changed my life for the better, from piles of debt in 2014, to small regular investments these days (I’d probably be homeless without the site given recent health issues, if I’d not changed finances). I’d hate to lose access – certainly to the articles that help people like me most, but also understand that producing such quality should be rewarded. Hopefully in the future I will be able to start to repay what this site has given me, but for now thank you is all I can offer. @ermine – well 2024 was the year I did some ‘inflation adjusted’ calculations (with a helping hand from Al Cam the inflation guru). Let’s just say I wish I hadn’t. . I quickly recoiled and took the blue pill of nominal returns. Think I’ll stay there for mental well being reasons. 2024 also the year I attended a FIRE meetup for first time which was pretty cool. Matching blogs to real people is fascinating after all this time. I think you once met up with liberate dot life, a long since moth balled blog, in the real world. Which made me think an ermine hike to see some historic stones could be a grand day out! @Team M: Seasons Greeting to all at Monevator Towers. Great year in ’24! Long may it continue. P.S. I trust you have all now got over the office Christmas party? @Rhino: No guru – just wanted to understand inflation better and had the time and inclination to do so once I pulled the plug. Re: red pill (vs blue pill), see last para (that begins “Fearing …”) at: https://monevator.com/vanguard-price-rise/#comment-1852375 Merry Christmas / holiday of choice. TI (and TA) thanks for all you do. The subscription is a thanks rather than a particular interest in the extra articles. Without the free content I would never have been able to read so many of your great informative articles and not gone on to subscribe. As you say, it’s a balance and I for one think you do an amazing job at maintaining that balance. @all — Thanks to everyone for such smashing feedback, very generous and great to hear that we’re still mostly hitting the right spot. 🙂 @carl — Understood, and thanks for reading us. We definitely appreciate some people at the start of the journey are watching all the pennies — in fact we support that if things are tight! 🙂 One way we’ve tried to tilt towards this reality is to make the Maven member articles a bit more de-accumulation focused, so hopefully geared more for those at the other end of the journey, where there’s a bit more cash to spare but also a need for insights into the trickier and arguably less well-covered end of lifecycle… @The Investor First of all, thank you for all the amazingly helpful articles over the years and I wish you and everyone at Monevator a lovely Christmas and New Year! I think the general idea of making Maven member articles more de-accumulation focused, so hopefully geared for those with more cash to spare, is a pretty smart idea. It would be nice, however for the occassional free article on this area, even if it is primarily only a collection of free resources for less wealthy retirees. Happy 2025! Thank you to all the Monevator team! Another year of tremendously insightful articles and well worth the subscription. Happy Christmas. Ditto, all the supportive comments. It has been 5 years since feeling comfortable with our level of FI and finally pulling the plug on work. After many years of benefiting from all the fabulous articles and associated comments, I have finally and belatedly signed up as a Maven. £30 pa is a small price to pay for this great resource. Not sure I am yet a Mogul! Long may Monevator continue. Thanks to all at the Moneyvator team for the work you do and best wishes. @Rhino #33 Well I’m all for stoney things 😉 I went a blog meetup 12 years ago. In tribute to our host’s ‘I’m Still Standing’ riff I note that very few of those blogs are still standing. Ed Zitron’s article seems pertinent – it was the platforms wot ate all the good things. Plus people have lost the ability to read – it’s all youtube videos and podcasts. Panem et circenses because, y’know, focus is hard. I am still not a digital native, though I accept the STFU old man vibe from the last post. In return for eschewing the hive-mind I have time to think and to look, Thoreau’s a man is rich in what he can afford to leave alone is me. There’s little I can contribute to a meet-up, because as I learned then, I am a serious anomaly, both in having a work does not equal meaning philosophy which 12 years and some experimentation shows holds for me. And absolutely nobody else. Not quite Nagel’s What is it like to be a Bat but further along that line than is useful. The demon inflation makes it hard to see right. I do think anyone looking at a great 2024 does need to ask the question how much of this is real particularly if a lot of your capital was bought a while ago – pre Covid say. They still need to kiss the ground and thank their lucky stars, because although the numbers are wrong the value is largely preserved. But we do need to think of those starting out too. Hopefully they will gain from the crash yet to come when we discover AI isn’t all that, or indeed they will gain from the next 15 year bull run is somebody works out how to use it to add value. @TI I am all for keeping Weekend Reading on the open part of the site, and the deacc emphasis on mavens seems an equitable balance. I don’t feel taken advantage of at all, in the round playing some of the hints easily pay for a mogul subs. Sure, there’s some small print saying don’t do that, but I am old enough and ugly enough to go yeah whatever. So far my error was not to go big enough. A Merry Christmas to all Monevatorites, and be of good cheer because the World can’t end today since it’s already tomorrow in Australia 🙂 It is curious how my and @Gary’s (#21) recollections disagree. None of the media I saw expressed anything but stunned horror to the atrocities of 7 October 2023 – and that would have included both the BBC and Guardian because of their open access. In the weeks and months subsequently several commentators expressed their concern that the Israeli response was disproportionate, and that included people writing for the Guardian and also other papers – though there was rather little on the BBC website which includes little other than news (of course the broadcast discussion programmes will have covered all points of view). The Guardian also gave space to writers expressing support for Israel, though none that I saw that gave any credible justification for the death of 14,000 children as part of any legitimate self-defence. But more importantly, absolutely none used anyone’s Jewish faith as a basis for criticism. At least in the mainstream media I see. @Gary @Jonathan B — Thanks both for sharing your views but there are better venues to debate such a contentious topic I’d suggest, so with both sides represented let’s now please leave it there. Thanks! @ermine – ‘There’s little I can contribute to a meet-up, because as I learned then, I am a serious anomaly’ ..and therein lies the value of the contribution. Precisely because, rather than despite the fact, you present a perspective not shared by the majority. Sometimes we need the inconvenient lone voice of alternative rather than the comforting cacophony of the status quo. Happy Christmas & thanks as always, Monevator team. Glad to hear others who enjoyed the Ed Zitron piece (but agree that it did veer a bit into ‘old man shouts at cloud’ at times, so I hope it wasn’t just read by people like us as confirmation bias). This & the OG Doctorow piece are so important, I think, we are sleepwalking into it all, and it’s already pretty hideous. It will remain a slight mystery (I think being UK, rather than US, is definitely some of it, & not being as aggressive monetisers) why Monevator isn’t much bigger than it is, & so it’s a shame to have to say that consequently it’s probably the better for that. I suppose I must ask (unless I missed something) *cough* where’s the book. I know many people who say their careers went into another gear once they had a book published. But I also know that writing a book is really hard! And very different from writing shorter online pieces. (I must be in a minority of one who was unimpressed by Morgan Housel’s first book – I adore his blog essays, but didn’t think he managed to convert it successfull into a book format). Happy Christmas again, & here’s to good things in 2025 (for me, a return to form for LTI is high on my list!). Merry Christmas everyone, have a lovely time! As always, thanks for the links TI. 😀 Happy Christmas everyone. I’m so pleased that I found Monevator a few years ago (I can’t quite remember but think it was through the compound interest calculator). I agree that it does seem like one of the more civilised parts of the Internet and I routinely find the comments very intelligent and thought provoking. Thank you @TA and @TI for providing such a useful and informative resource. I look forward to the weekend reading email each and every week. @Alan — I think you’re right re: the Chase account wording, ‘including’ is a bit clearer. I’ve changed it now. Thanks! @Rhino — TA (mostly) and me (a little bit) finished 95% of a book about ten years ago. But for various reasons we couldn’t/didn’t get it to 100%. Now the original text would need revising and it’s all too daunting for what would probably be a labour of love only, realistically. @all — Thanks for the further nice comments — and for the new sign-ups! 🙂 Don’t want to clog this thread up with my thanks but we’re enjoying and appreciating them all.

Title: SEC Greenlights First Hybrid Bitcoin And Ethereum ETFs From Franklin Templeton, Hashdex
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/sec-greenlights-first-hybrid-bitcoin-and-ethereum-etfs-from-franklin-templeton-hashdex/
Time Published: 2024-12-21T12:30:02Z
Full Content:
Amid yesterday’s crypto market slump, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the first-ever dual Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) index exchange-traded funds (ETFs) from Franklin Templeton and Hashdex. The ETFs are scheduled for launch in January 2025. For the first time, the US financial regulator has approved hybrid Bitcoin-Ethereum index ETFs. Hashdex’s Crypto Index ETF will trade on Nasdaq, while Franklin Templeton’s Crypto Index ETF will be listed on the Cboe BZX Exchange. Both ETFs will hold spot BTC and ETH in proportions reflecting their respective market capitalizations, currently resulting in an 80:20 ratio favoring Bitcoin. However, the ETFs may expand to include other cryptocurrencies in the future, pending regulatory approval. The SEC highlighted that Franklin Templeton’s December 18 filing received expedited approval. Commenting on the development, Nate Geraci, President of The ETF Store, said: Will be interesting to see if BlackRock or others attempt to piggyback on this and launch similar ETFs. Regardless, I expect there will be meaningful demand for these products. Advisors love diversification. Especially in an emerging asset class such as crypto. Geraci emphasized the potential rationale behind the SEC’s decision to approve the crypto index ETFs, pointing to their similarities with the previously approved spot Bitcoin and spot Ethereum ETFs in terms of the trusts’ structure and the operation terms. The SEC added that proposals for both the ETFs aligned with the criteria set forth by the Exchange Act. For the uninitiated, the Exchange Act requires issuers to implement safeguards against fraud, manipulation, and risks to investors. Asset manager Hashdex first amended its S-1 filing with the SEC in October, and submitted a second amended application on November 25. Franklin Templeton filed its S-1 for the crypto index ETF in August. In Hashdex’s November filing, the company stated that other digital assets, such as Avalanche (AVAX), Chainlink (LINK), and Litecoin (LTC), may meet its eligibility criteria and could be added to the ETF in the future with regulatory approval. Franklin Templeton’s ETF also leaves room to add other cryptocurrencies, but did not specify any by name. Notably, Hashdex’s ETF will rely on custodial services from Coinbase, BitGo, Fidelity, and Gemini. Similarly, Franklin Templeton’s ETF will use BitGo and Coinbase as its primary custodians. The crypto ETF space is becoming increasingly competitive, thanks to their resounding success since their launch earlier this year. Experts opine that US-based crypto spot ETFs may soon overtake spot gold ETFs in terms of net assets held. Following the US, other countries in the world are also steadily warming up to the idea of regulated crypto ETFs. At press time, BTC trades at $95,824, down 4.8% in the past 24 hours.

Title: Governments and banks once mocked Bitcoin. Now they want in on it

After topping $100,000, Bitcoin supporters see the cryptocurrency soaring even higher. Bitcoin has proven to be one of the best-performing assets in modern history. The value of the cryptocurrency has increased some 1,000 times over the past decade, far outpacing US stocks and real estate. Buoyed by United States President-elect Donald Trump’s crypto-friendly stance, Bitcoin’s record rally hit a new high of $107,000 on Monday after the Republican reiterated his intention to create a Bitcoin strategic reserve. Bitcoin, the first decentralised digital currency, was invented by the pseudonymous figure Satoshi Nakamoto in the wake of the 2007-2008 global financial crisis. Nakamoto introduced the blockchain system – a digital ledger that stores transactions in a network of computers – to enable anyone to make financial transactions without the involvement of banks, financial firms or governments. Once widely derided as a speculative asset with no intrinsic value, Bitcoin is being taken increasingly seriously by governments, financial institutions and investors alike. Boaz Sobrado, a London-based fintech analyst, said Bitcoin has transformed from being a niche asset favoured by political dissidents and criminals carrying out Illicit transactions “to something that central banks have to keep in mind and consider”. “The IMF has put very firm anti-crypto political guidelines into place when negotiating with countries that might require its own assistance. It’s gone from being an academic question to a practical, real one and one that central banks are taking very seriously now,” Sobrado told Al Jazeera. In January, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved Bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds), allowing investors to have exposure to the asset on the stock exchange for the first time. In an October report, the US Department of the Treasury referred to Bitcoin as “digital gold”, noting its use as a store of value. A number of countries have made big bets on the cryptocurrency. El Salvador has accumulated some $600m worth of Bitcoin reserves and is one of just a handful of countries, along with the Central African Republic, that accepts the asset as legal tender. Other countries, including the US and the United Kingdom, have acquired large holdings of Bitcoin through the seizure of assets implicated in criminal activity. The US has seized at least 215,000 Bitcoins, valued at almost $21bn at current prices, since 2020, according to an analysis by crypto firm 21.co. With Trump returning to the White House, Bitcoin supporters are hopeful that cryptocurrencies will gain unprecedented legitimacy after years of government-led crackdowns on the sector. Despite once labelling Bitcoin “a scam”, Trump has emerged as arguably the world’s most powerful advocate for the asset. After pledging to make the US “crypto capital of the planet”, he has picked several high-profile crypto enthusiasts to join his incoming administration, including former PayPal Chief Operating Officer David Sacks as crypto tsar and Paul Atkins as SEC chair. Trump’s pro-crypto stance has found allies in the US Congress, such as Senator Cynthia Lummis, a Republican from Wyoming, who earlier this year introduced the BITCOIN Act of 2024, which would include Bitcoin among reserve assets such as gold and oil as a long-term store of value. Under Lummis’s plans, the government would buy roughly 200,000 Bitcoins every year for five years, and then hold the assets for 20 years as a hedge against inflation. “If we did that with five percent of all the Bitcoin that will ever exist – which is roughly a million Bitcoin – we could cut our debt in half in 20 years,” Lummis said in a television interview with Fox Business. On Wall Street, derision and mockery have also given way to more positive appraisals. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who once described Bitcoin as an “index of money laundering”, in January said the commodity was “no different than what gold represented for thousands of years” and an “asset class that protects you”. The key attribute of Bitcoin that makes it revolutionary is that it separates money from the state, according to Max Keiser, senior Bitcoin adviser to El Salvador President Nayib Bukele. “This is the first time in history that this has ever happened – money exists that has no central authority controlling it. This is what makes it unique, very powerful,” Keiser told Al Jazeera. “There’s now this growing feeling that the 21st century will be the century of Bitcoin.” Keiser spotted Bitcoin’s potential early on and advised people to buy it when its value was only $1 in 2011. That year, he and his wife, television presenter Stacy Herbert, called Bitcoin “the currency of resistance”, and predicted it would top $100,000. One of the reasons Bitcoin has gained strength in value is the poor performance of economies such as Argentina, where inflation last year skyrocketed more than 200 percent, according to Gerald Celente, founder and director of the New York-based Trends Research Institute. “People were seeing their currencies being devalued… People were saying: ‘I’m losing all my money, what am I going to do?’ They can’t afford to buy gold, so they started buying whatever they could in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, so that kept it strong,” Celente told Al Jazeera. Since Trump’s election, Bitcoin’s price has risen by more than 50 percent and with an incoming pro-crypto administration, Celente predicts an even greater rally. “[The value] could go through the roof, but we don’t see [Bitcoin] going down much at all,” he said. Crypto supporters argue that Bitcoin’s winning advantage is that its global supply is capped at 21 million. Unlike central banks that can print money indefinitely, Bitcoin’s supply stays constant no matter the demand, which has helped boost its value against the dollar. Armando Pantoja, futurist and tech investor, believes that Bitcoin will appreciate in value “forever”, likening the purchase of the asset to buying real estate in Manhattan. “Bitcoin has value not because of the currency, but because of the technology that governs it, blockchain technology,” Pantoja told Al Jazeera. “In Bitcoin’s blockchain, there’s a certain supply of Bitcoin that comes out every 10 minutes, and every four years they cut it in half. Over time there is less and less Bitcoin being generated. “Once it reaches the limit, no more can be created… That’s why it’s going to keep going up, every four years when they cut the supply, it has to respond positively. It has to keep going up to supply the demand.” Keiser predicts Bitcoin will reach $1m in value in the coming years, with a market cap at least equal to gold’s market cap of $20 trillion. “That would be $1m a coin. I think that would be a conservative estimate for the price for the next three to four years,” he said. Bitcoin’s stellar rise, however, has not convinced everyone. Despite its recent rally, the commodity continues to be extremely volatile. After hitting $107,000 at the start of the week, the asset had by Friday plunged below $97,000. Many financial analysts continue to view Bitcoin as a bubble with little to support its stunning rise. “The more resources Americans misallocate to #Bitcoin and #crypto-related businesses, the fewer resources will be available to devote to making stuff we actually need,” Peter Schiff, chief economist at Euro Pacific Capital, said in a post on X last month. “The end result will be larger trade deficits, a weaker dollar, higher inflation, and a lower standard of living.” Even as Trump’s positive stance towards Bitcoin has thrilled crypto enthusiasts, some pro-crypto governments have reined in their support of the sector. El Salvador announced this week that it would privatize or close its cryptocurrency wallet “Chivo” as part of the terms of a $1.4bn loan deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Bukele’s government also agreed to make acceptance of Bitcoin by businesses voluntary, within steps to assuage the IMF’s concerns about Bitcoin-related risks. Some crypto supporters see governments and central banks taking a leading role in the global march towards digitised money with the development of their own currencies. Celente of the Trends Research Institute said the US, for example, could create its own digital currency as a way to pay off its federal debt. “There’s no way the US can pay off their $36 trillion worth of government debt. They may come up with a new cryptocurrency as part of CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currency),” Celente said. “You’re seeing more and more of the central banks talking about CBDCs, they’re definitely going to go into that direction,” Celente added. “They’re going to use this as an excuse to come up with a coin because they cannot pay off the debt that they have now. They’re going to say, ‘This [digital currency] is worth a lot more than the dollar, yuan, the euro,’ and use that to pay off their debt.” Some observers have warned that the introduction of CBDCs would open a Pandora’s box of problems related to government control and surveillance of people’s finances. Trump’s pick for commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, is the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, which manages the stockpile of US Treasuries that back Tether, the largest stablecoin by market cap. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are pegged to a traditional commodity or currency to maintain a stable price. They have reached record volumes of more than $200bn in total market cap. Sobrado said there could be an opening for Tether to become the national de facto privatised CBDC for the US, and for smaller economies such as the UAE, Hong Kong, Singapore and Switzerland to issue their own CBDCs. “The pro-crypto voices and Fed-critical voices have never been louder in the White House,” Sobrado said. Celente said he had no doubt that the future of money is digital. “There’s no question at all,” he affirmed. Follow Al Jazeera English:

(Bloomberg) -- BNP Paribas SA finalized the €5.1 billion ($5.3 billion) purchase of Axa SA’s asset management unit, in the biggest acquisition under Chief Executive Officer Jean-Laurent Bonnafe.

The transaction is expected to close by the middle of next year, and have an impact of 25 basis points on BNP Paribas’ CET1 ratio, the French lender said in a statement Saturday, confirming its previous guidance. The deal will create one of Europe’s largest money managers, with roughly €1.5 trillion in assets overseen. A good chunk will be in popular and usually more lucrative markets such as private credit, infrastructure and real estate, where Axa adds more than €200 billion. Prior to the purchase, the BNP CEO had shied away from big takeovers, deciding instead to return excess cash to shareholders after selling US lender Bank of the West for $16.3 billion last year. The Axa deal will allow BNP to challenge Europe’s No. 1 in asset management, Amundi SA, although it would still be dwarfed by US firms such as BlackRock Inc. or Vanguard Group Inc. Axa has said it plans to use proceeds from the sale for share buybacks and to fund growth.

Title: Jim Cramer Says He’s Sure That The Broad Demand for NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)’s Products Isn’t Going Anywhere

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Latest Stocks: 23 Stocks He Just Talked About. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. With the Federal Reserve's December meeting over, Wall Street has now shifted into a new paradigm. While the central bank did cut interest rates by 25 basis points in a widely anticipated move, the bank also signaled that 2025 might be accompanied by fewer interest rate cuts than many might have anticipated. In fact, not only are markets convinced that the Fed will cut less in 2025, but some even believe that the interest rates might be hiked especially since the central bank's median 2025 inflation outlook is 2.5% which is higher compared to the earlier 2.1%. While the Fed's announcements and the press conference sent the flagship S&P index by 3.2%, Jim Cramer explained how the stock market as a whole isn't doing that well. On the episode of Squawk On The Street the day of the interest cut, he stated "Look at the material stocks, look at anything related to industrial export. Look at the housing stocks. David, there are cohorts that are indeed rolling over. It isn't like everything is just super strong and everything is quantum computing and Rocket Lab!" Cramer added that while some believe that sections of the economy such as retail are strong, there might be a need to look deeper. "Look there's this growing consensus not represented necessarily in these Fed fund futures but that just says why are they doing this? And I come back and say why are they doing this," said Cramer, adding "So I think that the talking heads, and boy are there ever a lot of talking heads, have decided that look that if you look at what we're seeing in some retailers, things are strong. By the way in retail, it's not strong either if you count colds." Going against the trend, he stressed the need to look into the data to find the right stocks. According to him, "I don't know where these people get that things are strong, they look at the aggregate numbers, I look at the individual companies, I am trying to find companies that are strong." Cramer was also perplexed by the Atlanta Fed's Q4 3.2% GDP growth estimates. He shared that he's "trying to find why. I'm trying to find where that is. You know David that travel's very strong yeah. Leisure's very strong. Dining out's very strong. These are strong and by the way, they're very obvious, they look obvious to the Atlanta Fed. I don't know what kind of weighting they have but wow." The American economy wasn't the only economy on Cramer's mind. While he might be having a hard time believing the GDP estimates, there isn't a doubt in his mind that the US is the best place to invest. Cramer shared that he's "trying to find countries, maybe Argentina making a comeback, but it's very difficult to find a country that I would invest in," but it's very difficult to "find a country that isn't upset in turmoil or something." Speaking of other countries, Cramer believes that China "is behind so much of what's going wrong. But they are never, other than [BY] Peter Navarro, called out." On how the "media and other coverage says that China is in a depression," Cramer has "to believe it because I don't believe a single number they send. We used to be able to look at their electric power. . . . .how about when they used to do employment of youth." One economic sector that he's worried about is the automobile industry. Cramer doesn't "understand why the problems with autos are not so visible among the cognoscenti," something he believes is very important since autos "is a huge industry. Employs a lot of people. And the layoffs and the ramifications of what could happen here and other mergers." China is "getting away with murder, they really are, they're getting away with wiping out industries all over the world," Cramer said, adding that "there's only one guy who actually stands up them, and even he was saying that he has a good relationship with Xi. And that is President-elect Trump." However, on an optimistic note, Cramer believes that the "Mag 7 seems almost immune even to China. Which they never really got into." Our Methodology To make our list of the latest stocks on Jim Cramer's mind, we made a list of the stocks he talked about during a fresh episode of CNBC's Squawk In The Morning. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 193 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is Wall Street's AI GPU darling whose products big tech can't get enough of. Yet, its GPUs, and particularly the latest Blackwell lineup, have also created doubts in investors' minds. Some quarters believe that as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s GPUs are in high demand, tight supply, and pricey, big tech companies like Amazon will be forced to switch to either custom chips or products from Broadcom or Marvell. Cramer isn't buying any of this as he's sure that the broad demand for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s products isn't going anywhere: "And I'm absolutely sure about that. Just the fact that Microsoft got their chips, immediately the wags, whoever the wags are said oh then there must be a demand problem if they got all their chips. That's completely untrue. I do not like, Carl, as you know, an up opening. The people who bought it yesterday at $127. It will be heat-seeking missiles blasting that $133. You need a crescendo sell-off and we did not. Haven't yet. Overall NVDA ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 76 The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is a multimedia and entertainment giant and a household name. The shifting winds in the media industry created by the rise of streaming services have created trouble for the firm in 2024. By mid-November, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)'s stock was up by a modest 13% year-to-date as it battled an 8% revenue and 22% operating income drop in Q1. However, since mid-November's Q3 report, the shares have gained 8.42%. During Q3, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)'s streaming operating profit sat at $322 million and an overall profit of $47 million. The overall profit was the first in history, and Cramer thinks a turnaround is in sight: "You know that I have turned positive on Disney. Hugh Johnson, CFO is helping too. Well Morgan Stanley, I think they agree with me. Now they take a, they really have a top pick situation, and they ask Spotify, which by the way they raised the price target, Spotify is a great subscription model.

On how the "media and other coverage says that China is in a depression," Cramer has "to believe it because I don't believe a single number they send. We used to be able to look at their electric power. . . . .how about when they used to do employment of youth." One economic sector that he's worried about is the automobile industry. Cramer doesn't "understand why the problems with autos are not so visible among the cognoscenti," something he believes is very important since autos "is a huge industry. Employs a lot of people. And the layoffs and the ramifications of what could happen here and other mergers." China is "getting away with murder, they really are, they're getting away with wiping out industries all over the world," Cramer said, adding that "there's only one guy who actually stands up them, and even he was saying that he has a good relationship with Xi. And that is President-elect Trump." However, on an optimistic note, Cramer believes that the "Mag 7 seems almost immune even to China. Which they never really got into." Our Methodology To make our list of the latest stocks on Jim Cramer's mind, we made a list of the stocks he talked about during a fresh episode of CNBC's Squawk In The Morning. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A row of shelves in a retail pharmacy, demonstrating the variety of drugs and over-the-counter products. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 63 CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is the healthcare benefits manager facing significant stock price storms in December. Over the past month, the firm's shares have lost 21.5%. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS)'s share price performance is driven by growing government and public sentiment against benefits providers as well as President-elect Trump's intent to take on the healthcare middlemen. The shifting winds have come amidst a turnaround effort through which CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is purportedly looking to spin-off businesses such as its Medicare Advantage division. To boot, the Justice Department has also accused the firm of filing illegal opioid prescriptions, and similar accusations in the past have cost CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) as much as $5 billion in resolution. According to Cramer: "CVS is a real company. And the stock broke down, I saw someone on Frank Holland's show this morning talk about a potential bottoming in some of these. Look, the President-elect does not say it once. He says it like ten times. That he wants to wipe out middleman. I mean it's a theme." Overall CVS ranks 12th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of CVS as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CVS but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Cramer on Salesforce, Inc. (CRM): AI Innovations Drive Market Confidence

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 14 Stocks That Jim Cramer Recently Talked About. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer recently talked about. In his latest appearance on CNBC’s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer continued to talk about the incoming Trump administration’s tariffs. Coupled with the Fed’s data-driven interest rates cycle, tariffs have created quite a stir on Wall Street as investors are wary of them contributing to inflationary pressures and making the central bank hesitate when it comes to reducing rates. He believes that one of the key issues surrounding tariffs is the interconnection between the US and China. Cramer shared that “I know many business people have talked to President-elect Trump and they’ve said, ‘It’s not as simple as steel. Steel’s a hundred thousand people, I mean some of these companies have three hundred, four hundred thousand people themselves. I think the problem is we’re so intertwined and a lot of people felt, you know what, when President Trump, or when he was President Trump, you basically felt you were supposed to go from China to Mexico. Seemed like a good deal. And Mexico seemed like, favored.” Since then, Cramer shared that the sentiment around Mexico has changed. According to him, the same people are now wondering “Why did we go to this country that apparently doesn’t like.” He also shed light on the relationship between China and Mexico and shared that “China and Mexico are strange bedfellows. China’s been flooding the country with autos! And, what we did was we moved all of our auto production down there! Also Germany, you go to Puebla, and it’s Volkswagen!” He added that this makes implementing tariffs tricky as “it’s just that the cars go back and forth, and back and forth, where, where do we put the tariff on? Where to we take it off?” However, while the market might be worried about the broader impact of tariffs, businesses are also excited about growing merger and acquisition activity. Cramer outlined that “very quickly, people just say, you know what, look, tariffs are so convoluted that something has to happen. But the idea that they can talk to other companies and maybe combine, they want that so badly.” Apart from his takes on stocks, some of Cramer’s most controversial views are of cryptocurrencies. While he doesn’t advocate completely shunning them, the tight-knit crypto community either panics when he’s bullish for Bitcoin due to the well-known inverse Cramer effect or wonders why he doesn’t advocate holding more crypto as part of a portfolio. In a recent episode of Mad Money, Cramer shared some of his latest thoughts about crypto: “I’ve always endorsed keeping up to 10% of your portfolio in gold as a kind of insurance against the world’s lunacy. But for years now, I’ve also been saying Bitcoin’s a fine alternative to gold for that 10% position. Why not? I think the federal budget deficit is at impossible levels. I don’t want to be wedded to a currency backed by the full faith and credit of a country that owes $36 trillion.” Cramer reiterated that there’s more to investing than simply “just owning cryptocurrencies.” In fact, he believes that buying stocks can potentially lead to an investor making more money than buying cryptocurrencies. “Bitcoin’s part of the most obviously diversified portfolio in recent history,” believes Cramer. “Buying and holding stocks can be just as lucrative as buying Bitcoin six days after Biden dropped out of the race. Or maybe, just maybe, it can make you even more money.” Another Mad Money episode saw him stress that he has held Bitcoin for years as Cramer shared: “I want to discuss Bitcoin, really. I do—not to the detriment of stocks but in addition to stocks. I come to praise Bitcoin, not buy it. First, let’s dispel the idea that I’ve never believed in Bitcoin. Now, if you search YouTube, you can see that I first bought Bitcoin on September 15, 2020, when it was at just over $10,000.” To make our list of stocks that Jim Cramer is talking about, we listed down stocks he commented on during at latest episode of CNBC’s Squawk on the Street and tweeted about. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 116 Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is one of the biggest customer relationship management software providers in the world. The firm commanded a 21.7% market share in 2023. In 2024, Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)’s shares have gained 39% year-to-date. As has been the case with most SaaS companies this year, the firm’s narrative has also been driven by AI. CRM applications are believed to be on the chopping block as firms switch to AI chatbots and other tools. As a result, Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)’s shares were up by a modest 16% from the start of the year to November 5th. Since then, the stock has gained 20% as Wall Street gathered confidence in Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)’s AI applications and products. As for Cramer, here’s what he shared: “But everyone is focused in Salesforce, which you know I am too. Overall, CRM ranks 3rd on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of CRM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Cramer Criticizes Danaher (DHR) for Lackluster Performance and Unimpressive Guidance

Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 98 Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) is a medical products company that supplies items to the biotechnology, diagnostics, and other industries. It also plays a key role in the bioprocessing industry, which is a sector thought to have considerable exposure to emerging and high-end medical industries such as gene editing and therapies. Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR)’s diagnostics and bioprocessing businesses, which have exposure to gene testing and drug discovery posted $2.36 billion and $1.78 billion in Q3 sales. Both of these beat analyst estimates but the stock tumbled by 11% following the earnings as its profit fell and the guidance failed to impress investors. Cramer is among those unimpressed by the direction Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) is taking as he shared: “The year-over-year from Danaher is terrible. They have not tried to stimulate where we thought they would, which is in medtech and in pharma.

Title: Kevin Power: Literary magazines are all the more vital for operating off the commercial grid

Last week, my Irish lit-mag slog took me through the uplands and lowlands of nonfiction country, with its personal essays and activist journalism, its mixed-media photo-essays and longform critical badgerings. This week, we’re doing the fiction and the poetry. I might as well say at this point that I feel largely unqualified to judge contemporary poetry. If pushed, I work with a flexible axiom, to wit: I don’t know much about poetry, but I know what I like. You have been warned. I’ll begin with The Stinging Fly, by now a grandparental presence on the Irish lit-mag scene. The Fly’s founding editor, Declan Meade, has now stepped backward or upward to oversee a miniature publishing empire, and the magazine proper is edited by the novelist Lisa McInerney (author of The Glorious Heresies). But the spirit of the mag feels consistent, which is to say that it continues to publish elusive, modernist-inflected short fiction that makes you laugh when it doesn’t make you scratch your head (and you could say the same about the poetry). [ Lisa McInerney: ‘I’m a hoor for attention. It has to be good attention, though’Opens in new window ] Highlights of the Winter 2024-25 issue include The Wrong Thing, a story about grief, shock, and consciousness itself by Keith Ridgway; a pleasantly meandering personal essay about a 2005 visit to Sudan by Eimear McBride; and a spooky, memorable story by a young writer appropriately named James Young, called Long Term Parking. This starts out like a chatty blog post about a Sopranos episode (Long Term Parking) and becomes something much deeper and darker by gradual strange degrees. Potent stuff. Also potent: a poem by Karl Parkinson called Don’t Want to Die, which would suffer in quotation; buy the issue, read the poem. Banshee, founded in 2014 by Claire Hennessy, Eimear Ryan, and Laura Cassidy, appears twice a year. In spirit feminist and Irish (hence the name), Banshee nonetheless publishes ecumenically across all genders, and each issue contains a mixture of poetry and prose. Issue 18 (Autumn/Winter 2024) features an extract from Rosita Sweetman’s forthcoming memoir, which is wonderfully titled A Girl with a Fork in a World of Soup, and which, on the evidence of this extract, has an equally wonderful first line: “The first thing I remember is being in Mum’s womb.” [ Rosita Sweetman: As a wife and mother I learned feminism all overOpens in new window ] Banshee Issue 18 also includes Memory Prompts, a personal essay by Ruby Eastwood about various visits to her father in Barcelona: “Remember that his carefulness is not just the carefulness of the very drunk, that he’s like this even in his brief moments of sobriety.” The “memory prompts” of the title are instructions composed on the Notes app of Eastwood’s phone, “a series of imperatives” – self commanding self, that is, to recall the vital details of this most vexed, and most personal, of relationships. It’s a powerful piece. Ragaire, published out of Galway, is a newcomer; Issue 1 appeared this summer. A “ragaire”, the editors tell me, is someone who enjoys walking at night, when things look and feel secretive, different. The Ragaire vibe is one of disquiet; I like it. Issue 1 features both poetry and prose. Even Keel, a poem by Helen Campbell, is laid out like a right-angled triangle: “A/tiny/pill will/give you the/illusion of skimming/over the surface of life,” it begins, and ends with its longest line: “someday you will wake up to know that sailing is not a substitute for living.” Striking work. Ragaire also includes Tepid, a five-page short story by Phoebe Santow about a young woman spending a college semester abroad in Dublin. That description might ring alarm bells (not another one!), but this strange, numb story, with its perfectly controlled paragraphs, generates real insight and a deep sense of unease. Last line: “My hands grip his back like a retreat into childhood.” That’s the good stuff. The Four-Faced Liar is published out of Cork (but nobody’s perfect); it is a conspicuously beautiful object, a large-format magazine with photographs and artwork gorgeously printed. It offers a poetry and prose mix, or perhaps buffet is the word I’m looking for. The vibe is bouncy, funny, with underlying darkness. Issue 2 contains a short story about grief by Conor Griffin, Too Good for Charity, which begins with the line, “In some ways I enjoyed the aftermath of my father’s death,” and only gets better from there. “In school I was the type […] who induced a sigh of relief from many a father when I showed up shy-eyed and strangling a wilting corsage to collect his daughter for the debs.” Jokes in fiction are a sign that the writer’s intelligence is operating in high gear. A joke that also beautifully reveals character? In the trade, we call that a twofer. Also worth picking up a copy of The Four-Faced Liar for is a very short story called Unsent Application to Become a Foster Parent by Andrew Rucker Jones. This takes the form of increasingly long, increasingly funny, and increasingly heartbreaking responses to the questions posed by the eponymous application form. It stayed with me. Flash fiction, like poetry, occupies a zone of literary achievement to which I am largely a stranger (look, we’re all philistines about something). Splonk, an online flash-fiction journal edited by the novelist Nuala O’Connor, therefore introduced me to what is, I think, essentially a non-narrative form, or perhaps a narrative halfway house between the prose poem (which no one has ever satisfactorily defined) and the vignette or sketch (also never satisfactorily defined). Issue 12 of Splonk features The Questions by the splendidly named poet Partridge Boswell; its elusive and allusive paragraphs seem to be about a father speaking to a son, and its closing lines achieve a unique effect, not quite that of a conventional short story: “Life is so f**king long, my favourite professor told me at a back porch kegger after graduation. Tap in hand, I nodded and refilled his cup. I didn’t have the heart then to tell him what I don’t have to tell you now. He was wrong.” Sinéad Creedon and Orla Murphy, Dublin-based writers and editors, have been publishing Sonder since 2019; they’re now up to Issue X, and Belfast-based writer Aisling Kearney has since joined the editorial squad. Each issue has a theme (Identity, Belonging, Madness); most issues also have a “featured writer.” Since the featured writer for the current edition, (theme: Need), is Kevin Power (sterling work, a name to watch), I’d better limit my remarks to Issue IX (theme: Madness), whose featured writer is the journalist, novelist and memoirist Sophie White; she contributes a funny, dark vignette about female bodies and death. Sonder offers shoestring shelter to some extremely impressive work by younger writers. Issue IX contains two short pieces by Lea McCarthy, who (according to her bio note) studied Creative Writing at NUIG. I Believe in Something Something is about Knock airport (no, really); it recounts the vision of Mary beheld by Mary Byrne and Mary McLoughlin in 1879; it contains this sentence: “The Marys (the solid Marys) ran home and spread the gospel.” The solid Marys: deft, funny. Heads Up, Ladies, also by Lea McCarthy, is about an under-15s ladies’ Gaelic football team – their lives, their world: “This muddiness, this cold hard smack, this pitch with the wonky white lines and the nepotistic linesmen.” In two pages, it’s all there. Shakily funded, sometimes shakily produced, lit mags are not just the staging area for the “real” (that is, moneymaking) literary culture. They are themselves a literary culture Also worthy of mention, from Sonder Issue IX, is Alicia Bones’s short story, The City After Dark. A married office worker surreally parts company with his own life across a single evening. Like a sour Murakami, or the earlier novels of Ottessa Moshfegh: “She pushes me into an empty room. ‘My mother forgot my birthday today, you s**t.’ I can relate.” The Pig’s Back, edited by Dean Fee and Emily Cooper (both also writers), is published out of Letterkenny; it’s “a literary prose journal that aims to bring the rest of Ireland – and in turn, the world – to the northwest”. I didn’t, alas, receive a hard copy of the latest issue, but the website presents some excellent work. Direct Message, a short story by Grace Banks, is about a young queer woman, Mia, who can’t get over her ex, and who manipulates the rules of social media (and of social actuality) to perpetrate a kind of revenge. Another relative newcomer is Profiles, a Dublin literary and visual arts journal edited by Clare Healy & Sarah Sturzel. On the evidence of issue iii, Profiles is the real deal: the art and design are spectacular, and the fiction is unusually good. Loss Adjustment by Dara Higgins, about a middle-aged man who quits his job to write poetry and can’t, might be the best short story I encountered in any of these journals: hilarious, empathetic, stylish. Irish Carnage?: Essays on Political Violence by Chris Beausang is an unnerving bit of modernism, in the form of an academic book review that is also a memoir and an essay on, of course, political violence. Southword, edited by Patrick Cotter and Billy O’Callaghan and published by the Munster Literature Centre, is another venerable presence on the lit mag scene. It publishes both poetry and prose. Issue 47 features Vigilante, a short story by Karen Jennings. A female academic moves house after a break-up; little happens, until you realise the story is about “material culture,” which is both the academic’s field of study and the physical basis of emotion in our lives. Also an excellent poem, Tigers by Jonathan Edwards, about zoos, animals, us. So, that’s that. What have I learned? Everyone who thrives on the literary scene agrees that we need a thriving literary scene. But the real question is, why? What are lit mags for? They are not, surely, just a greenhouse for new writers who will later be ground up by the Big Five commercial-publishing agribusiness machine. Shakily funded, sometimes shakily produced, lit mags are not just the staging area for the “real” (that is, moneymaking) literary culture. They are themselves a literary culture, all the more vital (and vital, here, means both “necessary” and “alive”) for operating off the commercial grid. Oh, sure, they’re a counterculture, the house journals of a priestly and passionate underground. Hardly anyone reads them, measured by head of population. But that’s the good news. When most people aren’t paying attention, you never know what you might get away with. Kevin Power is an assistant professor of English at Trinity College Dublin.

It was not working before, due to the stack limitation. Your local Alchemist was not holding out on you, they just weren’t getting procs until the fix above was implemented.

Title: GitLab Inc. (GTLB): A Bull Case Theory
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gitlab-inc-gtlb-bull-case-231340686.html
Time Published: 2024-12-20T23:13:40Z

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We came across a bullish thesis on GitLab Inc. (GTLB) on High Growth Investing’s Substack by Stefan Waldhauser. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on GTLB. GitLab Inc. (GTLB)'s share was trading at $55.66 as of Dec 19th. GTLB’s trailing and forward P/E was 69.44 according to Yahoo Finance. A corporate executive standing in front of a large monitor, demonstrating the DevOps package repository. GitLab (GTLB), a standout from the 2021 IPO cohort, has navigated a turbulent journey in the public markets. Like many high-growth tech companies of its era, GitLab’s debut came at a premium valuation, leading to an inevitable correction as its stock shed nearly 80% of its value during the market downturn of 2022-2023. However, since mid-2024, GitLab has staged an impressive recovery, buoyed by solid financial performance and growing investor confidence. GitLab provides an all-encompassing platform for software development, catering to the DevOps and DevSecOps ecosystems. This integrated approach streamlines collaboration between development, operations, and security teams, enabling organizations to enhance the efficiency, speed, and quality of their software development cycles. Originating as an open-source project in 2011, GitLab has evolved into a full-fledged enterprise offering under the leadership of co-founder Sid Sijbrandij, who transitioned to Chairman at the end of 2024 due to health reasons. Its seamless blend of version control, issue tracking, continuous deployment, and compliance tools positions GitLab as a premier DevSecOps solution, differentiating it from competitors like GitHub and Bitbucket. GitLab’s commitment to innovation and automation, underpinned by AI and machine learning capabilities, has established it as a leader in a growing market projected to reach $40 billion. Its land-and-expand strategy has been remarkably effective, reflected in a net retention rate of 124%. With over 30 million registered users and a robust enterprise customer base—including over 1,100 organizations paying annual fees exceeding $100,000—GitLab continues to expand its footprint in the software development sector. This dynamic customer base underscores the platform's significance to large enterprises, many of which have committed to multi-year contracts as evidenced by GitLab’s $812 million in remaining performance obligations (RPOs). The company’s financial results for Q3 FY25 showcased its resilience and growth trajectory. Revenue rose 31% year-over-year to $196 million, while RPOs surged 48%, signaling strong long-term commitments from customers. With 70% of FY25 revenue already locked in and the potential for significant upselling, GitLab’s growth slowdown appears to be temporary. Its exceptional gross margin of 89% highlights its scalability and profitability potential. Over the past two years, GitLab has dramatically improved operational efficiency, with marketing and sales expenses dropping from 60% to 40% of revenue and administrative costs falling from 20% to 14%. Consequently, the non-GAAP operating margin expanded by 1,000 basis points to 13% in Q3 FY25. GitLab achieved free cash flow breakeven a year ahead of schedule in FY24 and has since demonstrated a robust cash flow profile, despite minor fluctuations in recent quarters. These results underscore its ability to transition from a high-growth company to a cash-generative enterprise as it scales further. With a total addressable market still in its early stages of penetration, GitLab is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for unified DevSecOps platforms. In summary, GitLab represents a compelling investment opportunity with strong fundamentals, a dominant market position, and a clear path to sustained growth. Its recent operational improvements and financial discipline have set the stage for significant value creation, making it an attractive addition to any growth-focused portfolio. GitLab Inc. (GTLB) is not on our list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 43 hedge fund portfolios held GTLB at the end of the third quarter which was 39 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of GTLB as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GTLB but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: It’s Not Unusual: Stablecoin Platform Altcoin USUAL Bucks Crypto Downtrend Following Binance Listing

The native token of a decentralized fiat stablecoin-issuing platform is rallying against the dipping crypto markets. Two days ago, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, Binance, added support for Usual Protocol (USUAL). “Binance is excited to announce that Usual (USUAL) will be added to Binance Simple Earn, Buy Crypto, Binance Convert, Binance Margin, Binance Auto-Invest, and Binance Futures at the respective dates and timings listed below.” According to a post on the social media platform X from Usual in response to the Binance listing, the team says the protocol aims to usher in a “stablecoin renaissance”. “90% for the Community: Usual is built to empower, with the majority of tokens for users. No VC (venture capital)/Team Dumps: Just 10% allocated to insiders, cliffed for one year. 100% Revenue for the DAO (decentralized autonomous organization): Every $ of revenue belongs to USUAL holders” According to the Usual Protocol’s website, USUAL acts as a governance token performing two major functions: “1. Usual is a multi-chain infrastructure that aggregates the growing tokenized Real-World Assets (RWAs) from entities like BlackRock, Ondo, Mountain Protocol, M0 or Hashnote to transform them into a permissionless, on-chain verifiable, and composable stablecoin (USD0). 2. Usual is built around the redistribution of power and ownership to users & third parties, akin to a scenario where Tether’s TVL providers would own the company and the associated revenues.” USUAL is going for $1.43 at time of writing, up 17% on the day. Meanwhile, the total crypto market cap is down 6% over the same period. Generated Image: Midjourney Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

Title: Why SolarEdge (SEDG) And Shoals (SHLS) Are Climbing

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. SolarEdge (SEDG) stock is soaring 15% today. The shares appear to be rallying due to residual momentum from a rare double upgrade of the shares by Goldman Sachs earlier this week. Meanwhile, another name in the sector, Shoals (SHLS), is also rising sharply today after it was upgraded by Morgan Stanley on Tuesday. SolarEdge manufactures solar inverters that convert power from solar panels into usable electricity, while Shoals develops and markets electrical balance of systems that enable the safe and efficient transportation of electricity from the solar panels to their destinations. A photovoltaic field at dawn, its solar panels shimmering in the light of a new day. On Dec. 17, Goldman Sachs raised its rating on SolarEdge to Buy from Sell. Moreover, the investment bank hiked its price target on the shares to $19 from $10. According to Goldman, the risk-reward ratio of SEDG stock is positive. That's because worries about the company's ability to make $350 million of debt payments in 2025 are overdone, according to the bank. Moreover, SolarEdge's cost-cutting efforts and more favorable product mix should combine to lift its free cash flow, margins, and bottom line, Goldman believes. Also importantly, Goldman expects the U.S. and European rooftop solar markets to resume expanding in 2025, and it believes that the utility-scale solar sector could also grow next year. What's more, the increased demand for electricity in the U.S. may make investors more bullish on solar stocks, according to Goldman. Also on Dec. 17, Morgan Stanley upgraded Shoals to Overweight from Equal Weight. Writing that SHLS stock had reached "an attractive entry point," the investment bank predicted that the company's revenue would increase about 10% in 2025. And from 2024 to 2027, Morgan Stanley predicts that the company's sales will increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12%. While we acknowledge the potential of SEDG and SHLS, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than SEDG and SHLS but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: DeFi Protocol Usual's Surge Catapults Hashnote's Tokenized Treasury Over BlackRock's BUIDL

Time Published: 2024-12-20T20:16:30Z
Full Content:
There's been a change of guard at the rankings of the $3.4 billion tokenized Treasuries market. Asset manager Hashnote's USYC token zoomed over $1.2 billion in market capitalization, growing five-fold in size over the past three months, rwa.xyz data shows. It has toppled the $450 million BUIDL, issued by asset management behemoth BlackRock and tokenization firm Securitize, which was the largest product by size since April. USYC is the token representation of the Hashnote International Short Duration Yield Fund, which, according to the company's website, invests in reverse repo agreements on U.S. government-backed securities and Treasury bills held in custody at the Bank of New York Mellon. Hashnote's quick growth underscores the importance of interconnecting tokenized products with decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and presenting their tokens available as building blocks for other products — or composability, in crypto lingo — to scale and reach broader adoption. It also showcases crypto investors' appetite for yield-generating stablecoins, which are increasingly backed by tokenized products. USYC, for example, has greatly benefited from the rapid ascent of the budding decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Usual and its real-world asset-backed, yield-generating stablecoin, USD0. Usual is pursuing the market share of centralized stablecoins like Tether's USDT and Circle's USDC by redistributing a portion of revenues from its stablecoin's backing assets to holders. USD0 is primarily backed by USYC currently, but the protocol aims to add more RWAs to reserves in the future. It has recently announced the addition of Ethena's USDtb stablecoin, which is built on top of BUIDL. "The bull market triggered a massive inflow into stablecoins, yet the core issue with the largest stablecoins remains: they lack rewards for end users and do not give access to the yield they generate," said David Shuttleworth, partner at Anagram. "Moreover, users do not get access to the protocol’s equity by holding USDT or USDC." "Usual’s appeal is that it redistributes the yield along with ownership in the protocol back to users," he added. The protocol, and hence its USD0 stablecoin, has raked in $1.3 billion over the past few months as crypto investors chased on-chain yield opportunities. Another significant catalyst of growth was the protocol's governance token (USUAL) airdrop and exchange listing on Wednesday. USUAL started trading on Binance on Wednesday, and vastly outperformed the shaky broader crypto market, appreciating some 50% since then, per CoinGecko data. BlackRock's BUIDL also enjoyed rapid growth earlier this year, driven by DeFi platform Ondo Finance making the token the key reserve asset of its own yield-earning product, the Ondo Short-Term US Government Treasuries (OUSG) token.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of the 10 Best Growth Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other best growth stocks. Is a December rally in store for stocks in 2024? Some investors are expecting a surge in stocks from the 24th of December to the 3rd of January, 2025, also referred to as the Santa Claus Rally. On December 17, Ryan Detric, Chief Market Strategist at Carson Group, Joined Catalysts on Yahoo Finance to discuss whether he expects December to be a record-breaking month for the stock market. Historically, the first half of December is usually slow for the stock market, while the second half is faster, suggested Detric. He also added that compared to election years in the past, this December has been very “flattish” so far. He also suggested that the Fed is going to continue the easing cycle and with the CPI declining, the current market conditions are favorable. Detrick then added that despite macroeconomic conditions and the performance of the Dow Jones index recently, he expects to see a record surge this month and expects “Santa Claus” to make an appearance this year. Since the elections, stocks have been rallying with high hopes for the future. On December 18, Dan Ives, Managing Director at Wedbush Securities, joined Market Domination on Yahoo Finance to discuss his outlook on Big Tech and the new administration. Ives emphasized that the autonomous robotics and disruptive technologies sectors are going to benefit strongly from the new administration and its policies, despite concerns over tariffs. He also discussed the growing relationship between the new administration and Elon Musk, and how the two parties “need each other” to thrive, suggesting that Musk’s company has solid growth potential in the coming year and AI innovation will strengthen the collaboration immensely. He also added that the environment is extremely bullish for Big Tech and expects growth in the coming year. Ives shared that while there are a few road bumps, especially from the Chinese market, the environment in retrospect is positive. Speaking of the electric vehicle market, he emphasized that new policies in the US coupled with international consolidation, especially in Europe and Asia, will benefit EV makers in the United States immensely. The expectations from growth stocks are immense as the AI revolution takes precedence. To come up with the 10 best growth stocks to invest in now, we went over multiple rankings on the internet to compile an initial list of growth stocks. We then examined the hedge fund sentiment of each stock and picked the most popular ones. Our list is in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders as of Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A semiconductor production line, showing the complex procedures of chip manufacture. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading GPU maker driving innovation in artificial intelligence, gaming, creative design, autonomous vehicles, and robotics. In the third quarter of 2024, the company generated revenue worth $35.1 billion, up by 17% sequentially and 94% year-over-year. Most of the demand was propelled by the market’s growing AI needs in hardware especially. The company’s growing demand for its data center services and its Blackwell AI chip has ramped up expectations for the coming year. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been lagging compared to its record close last month. However, despite that analysts remain bullish on the stock, tying great expectations to its growth potential. On November 21, CFRA Research senior equity analyst, Angelo Zino, joined Yahoo Finance where he discussed his thesis on the stock. Zino shared that the stock has enormous cash flow potential, given the demand projections for its Blackwell AI chip and data center services. He also added that the stock has solid financials and will continue to exceed expectations in the coming year. Zino emphasized that investors must not read “too much” into the guidance especially because making a complex technology demands time. Overall, analysts are also bullish on NVDA and their median price target of $175 points to an upside of nearly 35%. Ithaka Group’s Ithaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA’s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artifi cial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock’s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefi ted from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia’s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat[1]and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today’s accelerated computing infrastructure.” Overall, NVDA ranks 5th on our list of the best growth stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Reuters) - Wells Fargo has withdrawn from a group of global banks committed to curbing greenhouse gas emissions, increasing the number of high-profile firms exiting climate initiatives amid mounting political pressure. The bank has ended its membership in the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, a spokesperson said on Friday, two weeks after another notable exit by Goldman Sachs. Financial firms, which have long been criticized for their ties to the fossil fuel industry, have tried to integrate net-zero standards more prominently into their operations. But more recently, they have started to scale back some of those initiatives to avoid irking Republicans. GOP officials have cracked down on companies they view as climate-friendly. Last month, asset management giants BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street were accused of violating antitrust law through climate activism in a lawsuit by Texas and 10 other Republican-led states. Wells Fargo, however, did not give a reason behind the move. "The alliance prefers not to see any bank leave but respects the decision Wells Fargo has made based on its own individual circumstances," an NZBA spokesperson said. The NZBA is a group of banks "committed to aligning their lending and investment portfolios with net-zero emissions by 2050," according to its website. Since the UN-backed alliance was founded in April 2021, it has attracted over 100 banks while five have left, the group's spokesperson said. "The overall increase in membership indicates how important understanding climate risk and the transition to net zero has become to banks and companies around the world," they added. Wells Fargo's exit was first reported by Bloomberg News earlier on Friday. (Reporting by Niket Nishant in Bengaluru; Editing by Krishna Chandra Eluri) Sign in to access your portfolio

We recently compiled a list of the 11 Important AI News and Ratings for Investors. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Dynatrace, Inc.’s (NYSE:DT) stands against the other AI stocks. The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence have raised both opportunities and concerns, especially regarding its safety and the ethical implications of its widespread use. Establishing regulatory frameworks for AI is essential to ensure its responsible development, protecting against potential risks while maximizing its positive impact across industries. The Future of Life Institute released its 2024 AI Safety Index, evaluating the safety practices of leading AI companies including Anthropic, Google DeepMind, OpenAI, x.AI, and Zhipu AI among others. The review panel, consisting of prominent AI experts, found significant gaps in the companies' risk management and safety strategies, especially regarding their ability to ensure that advanced AI systems remain beneficial and under human control. Despite some positive steps in certain areas, the panel expressed concern that these companies are not adequately addressing the existential risks associated with AI development. The report highlighted the need for improved accountability, transparency, and safety frameworks, as competitive pressures seem to be overshadowing safety considerations. The index aims to provide the public with insights into AI companies' safety efforts and encourage better practices within the industry. READ ALSO: 10 Companies Hoarding Bitcoin Like There's No Tomorrow and 11 AI News That You Should Not Miss. In a CNBC interview, Max Tegmark, president of the Future of Life Institute and MIT professor, emphasized the need for AI safety standards, drawing a parallel to regulated industries like aviation and medicine. He highlighted the current lack of clear plans to ensure AI safety, especially as systems like chatbots and autonomous vehicles become more integrated into real-world applications. Tegmark advocates for policy changes to make AI companies prioritize safety, much like other industries, to prevent potentially dangerous outcomes. While the situation is concerning, he believes that proper regulation could lead to significant benefits. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

We recently published a list of 10 AI News That Broke the Internet. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against other AI news that broke the Internet. As AI continues to evolve, its influence on business will be undeniable, reshaping industries with smarter, more efficient solutions. Companies that embrace these trends will be better equipped to innovate, compete, and thrive in an increasingly AI-driven world. According to Oliver Parker Vice President, Global Generative AI Go-To-Market, Google Cloud, artificial intelligence is set to significantly impact businesses in 2025, driving innovation and transforming operations. Key trends include multimodal AI, which combines text, audio, and visual data for more accurate and contextual analysis; AI agents that simplify complex workflows and support employees; improved enterprise search capabilities allowing users to access data through various media; improved customer experiences with personalized and predictive AI solutions; and stronger security systems powered by AI to detect threats and strengthen defenses. However, this progress also introduces challenges, especially in the realm of AI-driven security threats. READ ALSO: 10 Companies Hoarding Bitcoin Like There’s No Tomorrow and 9 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings. The AI landscape is undergoing a significant shift, with a growing focus on algorithmic innovations and software applications rather than just scaling hardware. As generative AI models mature, startups and smaller companies are emerging as key players, driving efficiency and new use cases in the field. In the discussion on CNBC, Chetan Puttagunta from Benchmark and Deirdre Bosa of CNBC focused on the evolving AI landscape. Chetan highlighted that AI innovation is shifting from large-scale hardware investments to algorithmic advancements, especially at the model layer, with entrepreneurs pushing the frontier in inference and AI applications. He mentioned that recent investment trends are moving toward smaller startups focused on algorithmic breakthroughs, as opposed to just scaling hardware. Deirdre added that AI’s generative phase is transitioning from pre-training large models to leveraging existing models for real-world applications. This phase is characterized by a focus on software, with smaller companies gaining traction, especially with the rise of open-source models like Llama, allowing new startups to challenge established players. Chetan gives examples like Sierra, which is revolutionizing customer service by automating tasks and improving customer experiences. Both see a significant opportunity for new AI-first startups to disrupt traditional software companies.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) stands against other AI news that broke the Internet. As AI continues to evolve, its influence on business will be undeniable, reshaping industries with smarter, more efficient solutions. Companies that embrace these trends will be better equipped to innovate, compete, and thrive in an increasingly AI-driven world. According to Oliver Parker Vice President, Global Generative AI Go-To-Market, Google Cloud, artificial intelligence is set to significantly impact businesses in 2025, driving innovation and transforming operations. Key trends include multimodal AI, which combines text, audio, and visual data for more accurate and contextual analysis; AI agents that simplify complex workflows and support employees; improved enterprise search capabilities allowing users to access data through various media; improved customer experiences with personalized and predictive AI solutions; and stronger security systems powered by AI to detect threats and strengthen defenses. However, this progress also introduces challenges, especially in the realm of AI-driven security threats.

The AI landscape is undergoing a significant shift, with a growing focus on algorithmic innovations and software applications rather than just scaling hardware. As generative AI models mature, startups and smaller companies are emerging as key players, driving efficiency and new use cases in the field. In the discussion on CNBC, Chetan Puttagunta from Benchmark and Deirdre Bosa of CNBC focused on the evolving AI landscape. Chetan highlighted that AI innovation is shifting from large-scale hardware investments to algorithmic advancements, especially at the model layer, with entrepreneurs pushing the frontier in inference and AI applications. He mentioned that recent investment trends are moving toward smaller startups focused on algorithmic breakthroughs, as opposed to just scaling hardware. Deirdre added that AI’s generative phase is transitioning from pre-training large models to leveraging existing models for real-world applications. This phase is characterized by a focus on software, with smaller companies gaining traction, especially with the rise of open-source models like Llama, allowing new startups to challenge established players. Chetan gives examples like Sierra, which is revolutionizing customer service by automating tasks and improving customer experiences. Both see a significant opportunity for new AI-first startups to disrupt traditional software companies. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

An aerial view of a bustling semiconductor production zone showcasing the company’s integrated circuits. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74 QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) integrates AI into its wireless technologies, supporting applications in mobile devices, automotive systems, IoT, and edge networking. It also invests in early-stage AI innovations, advancing connectivity and intelligent computing across industries. As reported by Reuters on December 18, Qualcomm estimated potential annual savings of $1.4 billion in royalties to Arm by acquiring Nuvia, a startup purchased for $1.4 billion in 2021, as revealed during a Delaware federal court trial. CEO Cristiano Amon testified that the acquisition was justified by these projected savings and Nuvia’s critical role in Qualcomm’s strategy to strengthen its chip designs for PCs and smartphones, aiming to compete with Apple and Intel. Qualcomm acquired Nuvia after attempts to partner with the startup failed, leveraging its expertise despite Nuvia’s lack of a finished product and initial focus on servers. The trial involves Arm’s claim that Qualcomm used Nuvia’s technology without proper licensing consent. Overall, QCOM ranks 5th on our list of AI news that broke the Internet. While we acknowledge the potential of QCOM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than QCOM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Man secures €600,000 settlement over alleged brain injury from Christmas Day fall on sister’s driveway
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/crime-law/courts/2024/12/20/man-secures-600000-settlement-over-alleged-brain-injury-from-christmas-day-fall-on-sisters-driveway/
Time Published: 2024-12-20T15:41:07Z

A financial consultant who alleged he fell and fractured his skull as he left his sister’s house on Christmas Day and ended up with a severe brain injury has settled a High Court action for €600,000. Anthony O’Riordan (81) was stretchered from the driveway of the house in Dalkey, Co Dublin after what is thought to have been a tumble as he attempted to get into a taxi on the driveway. His counsel, Bruce Antoniotti, instructed by Augustus Cullen Law, told the High Court Mr O’Riordan suffered a brain injury and has been left with cognitive deficits following the incident 12 years ago. Counsel said Mr O’Riordan had arrived with his wife and daughter at his sister’s house at 4pm on Christmas Day in 2012. The driveway where the fall allegedly occurred had a 9.5 degree slope. The O’Riordans were leaving about four hours later when he “disappeared from view” having apparently lost his balance after walking around the back of their taxi, counsel said. “We don’t know what happened and Mr O’Riordan does not remember the incident. We don’t know if he tripped, slipped or stumbled,” counsel said. The most likely explanation was that Mr O’Riordan stumbled, said Mr Antoniotti, noting the wing mirror of the taxi car broke off, which was consistent with somebody stumbling and grabbing the wing mirror. Mr O’Riordan, of Mount Merrion Avenue, Blackrock, had through his wife, Hilda, sued Irene and Robin Hennessy, of Knocknacree Road, Dalkey, over the incident. All of the claims were denied. He claimed he was negotiating the steep driveway and attempting to enter the taxi when he slipped and fell. He alleged there was a failure to ensure his safety, health and welfare while he was a guest on the premises and a failure to ensure that the cobble lock paving was cleaned with a power hose to ensure it was free from any build-up of grime liable to render the surface slippery, particularly in the winter months. It was alleged that Mr O’Riordan hit his head and was unconscious for about 20 minutes. He was diagnosed with a skull fracture and brain bleed that required surgery. Mr Antoniotti told the court that expert engineers on his client’s side were not critical of the driveway slope and said the rough surface was safe. A year and a half after the incident it was noted on inspection of the driveway that it was in pristine condition. Outlining the risk of further litigating the case, counsel said he had grave concerns and he could not say they would succeed if the case went to trial. Approving the settlement, Mr Justice Paul Coffey said there was no evidence as to how Mr O’Riordan fell and there was no criticism of the slope by the engineers. Noting the litigation risk, the judge said the offer was fair and reasonable. He said it must have been a very shocking event for the family and Christmas must now be a very difficult time for them. © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Novo Nordisk (NVO) stock is tumbling 21% today after individuals who received the company's experimental weight-loss drug shed many fewer pounds than expected. Specifically, the weight of patients who received Novo's anti-obesity drug, CagriSema, declined by an average of 20.4% in 68 weeks, versus the 25% average weight loss that Novo had expected the treatment to produce. A closeup shot of a laboratory technician handling a medical device used for fertility treatments. The company, however, stated that if all the patients who were tested had complied 100% with the treatment requirements, their mean weight loss would have been 22.7% and 40% of the trial participants would have shed at least 25% of their weight. Reporting that only 57% of patients in the trial received the highest dose of CagriSema, Novo stated that it was "encouraged" by the data and added that it intends to launch an additional trial of the drug by June 2025. Roughly 3,400 individuals were involved in the trial. Taken weekly as an injection, CagriSema consists of semaglutide and cagrilintide. Semaglutide, which is similar to the hunger-suppressing hormone called GLP-1, is also the main ingredient of Novo's anti-obesity drug, Wegovy. The latter treatment is already being widely used to combat obesity in the U.S. Cagrilintide acts similarly to a pancreas-based hormone called amylin. The average weight loss of the patients who took CagriSema was similar to the mean weight declines of individuals who have taken Eli Lilly's (LLY) Zepbound treatment. Novo Nordisk had hoped that CagriSema would surpass Zeopbound's performance. LLY stock is advancing 7.5% in early trading. While we acknowledge the potential of NVO, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Jim Cramer Says Cencora (COR) ‘Always Wins’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Latest Stocks: 23 Stocks He Just Talked About. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Cencora (NYSE:COR) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. With the Federal Reserve's December meeting over, Wall Street has now shifted into a new paradigm. While the central bank did cut interest rates by 25 basis points in a widely anticipated move, the bank also signaled that 2025 might be accompanied by fewer interest rate cuts than many might have anticipated. In fact, not only are markets convinced that the Fed will cut less in 2025, but some even believe that the interest rates might be hiked especially since the central bank's median 2025 inflation outlook is 2.5% which is higher compared to the earlier 2.1%. While the Fed's announcements and the press conference sent the flagship S&P index by 3.2%, Jim Cramer explained how the stock market as a whole isn't doing that well. On the episode of Squawk On The Street the day of the interest cut, he stated "Look at the material stocks, look at anything related to industrial export. Look at the housing stocks. David, there are cohorts that are indeed rolling over. It isn't like everything is just super strong and everything is quantum computing and Rocket Lab!" Cramer added that while some believe that sections of the economy such as retail are strong, there might be a need to look deeper. "Look there's this growing consensus not represented necessarily in these Fed fund futures but that just says why are they doing this? And I come back and say why are they doing this," said Cramer, adding "So I think that the talking heads, and boy are there ever a lot of talking heads, have decided that look that if you look at what we're seeing in some retailers, things are strong. By the way in retail, it's not strong either if you count colds." Going against the trend, he stressed the need to look into the data to find the right stocks. According to him, "I don't know where these people get that things are strong, they look at the aggregate numbers, I look at the individual companies, I am trying to find companies that are strong." Cramer was also perplexed by the Atlanta Fed's Q4 3.2% GDP growth estimates. He shared that he's "trying to find why. I'm trying to find where that is. You know David that travel's very strong yeah. Leisure's very strong. Dining out's very strong. These are strong and by the way, they're very obvious, they look obvious to the Atlanta Fed. I don't know what kind of weighting they have but wow." The American economy wasn't the only economy on Cramer's mind. While he might be having a hard time believing the GDP estimates, there isn't a doubt in his mind that the US is the best place to invest. Cramer shared that he's "trying to find countries, maybe Argentina making a comeback, but it's very difficult to find a country that I would invest in," but it's very difficult to "find a country that isn't upset in turmoil or something." Speaking of other countries, Cramer believes that China "is behind so much of what's going wrong. But they are never, other than [BY] Peter Navarro, called out." On how the "media and other coverage says that China is in a depression," Cramer has "to believe it because I don't believe a single number they send. We used to be able to look at their electric power. . . . .how about when they used to do employment of youth." One economic sector that he's worried about is the automobile industry. Cramer doesn't "understand why the problems with autos are not so visible among the cognoscenti," something he believes is very important since autos "is a huge industry. Employs a lot of people. And the layoffs and the ramifications of what could happen here and other mergers." China is "getting away with murder, they really are, they're getting away with wiping out industries all over the world," Cramer said, adding that "there's only one guy who actually stands up them, and even he was saying that he has a good relationship with Xi. And that is President-elect Trump." However, on an optimistic note, Cramer believes that the "Mag 7 seems almost immune even to China. Which they never really got into." Our Methodology To make our list of the latest stocks on Jim Cramer's mind, we made a list of the stocks he talked about during a fresh episode of CNBC's Squawk In The Morning. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A closeup of pills in a pharmacy, representing the high quality medications of the company. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 45 Cencora (NYSE:COR) is one of the biggest pharmacy distributors in America. Recent events surrounding the pharma and healthcare benefits management industry have placed its shares on the backfoot. Cencora (NYSE:COR)'s stock up 6% over the past month as investors reevaluate consumer perceptions of the benefits industry. The sentiment surrounding its sector has not been helped by President-elect Trump's blunt statements of 'destroying' the healthcare middleman. On a firm-specific level, Cencora (NYSE:COR) has benefited from its portfolio of specialty drugs that help treat diseases like cancer. These drugs are pricier than other medications, and they enable pharmacies to post robust margins. Cramer believes that taking on giants like Cencora (NYSE:COR) will be quite hard as they've withstood similar attempts in the future. According to him: "Cencora. It used to be a, had a different name. You cannot attack Cencora. They are Teflon. Cencora always wins." Overall COR ranks 17th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of COR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than COR but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Stock Prices May Fall On More Inflation, Slower Growth, Bitcoin Risk

396930 01: Traders and clerks work on the Eurodollar Futures floor of the Chicago Mercantile ... [+] Exchange November 6, 2001 after the FOMC announced an interest rate cut. The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a half-percentage point bringing the cost of short-term loans to their lowest level in 40 years after a flurry of grim economic reports. In cutting rates for a third time since the September 11 terrorist attacks, the Fed cited unusual forces restraining demand and left the door open to even more rate cuts. CME's flagship Eurodollar contract is the most actively traded short-term interest rate futures contract in the world, and the benchmark for short-term U.S. interest rates. (Photo by Tim Boyle/Getty Images) With the U.S. government careening toward a shutdown this weekend and a key inflation report due today, stock futures — led by a 1% drop in Nasdaq-100 futures — were down, according to the Wall Street Journal. Does this drop foreshadow declining stock prices in the next few years? Lacking a crystal ball, my prediction is yes. That’s because the scenario that strikes me as most likely will send stock prices down for four reasons: If you are not prepared to wait out a long period of stock market decline and a gradual recovery, taking equity profits could be a wise move. After two failed efforts to fund the government through March 2025; absent a deal today, the government could shut down at 12:01 a.m. on December 21. The economic consequences of such a shutdown would be significant. For example, “millions of federal employees and military service members” could be furloughed and Americans relying on federal assistance could face service disruptions, noted Seeking Alpha. Moreover, an extended government shutdown could cause flight delays since some TSA employees and air traffic controllers might call in sick, reported Axios. Leading the fall are technology stocks and bitcoin as investors await an inflation report that could send stocks down further. As semiconductor industry stocks — such as ASML, TSMC, AMD, Broadcom, and Nvidia — fell, bitcoin’s price dropped 12% from its peak to $95,000, the Journal reported. Fortunately for bulls, a report on the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge — the Personal Consumption Expenditures index — was better than expected. The PCE rose 0.1% in November — less than the expected 0.2%, according to CNBC. Some economists forecast tariffs imposed by President-Elect Donals Trump could revive inflation. Trump has announced a variety of tariff proposals — some linked to conduct of the countries whose goods would affected. During the election campaign, he pledged to impose 20% tariffs on all U.S. imports, reported the Journal. Following the November election, Trump also Executives of companies that import goods — which would likely be faced with higher costs when they pay the tariffs — have so far failed in their efforts to quash the Trump tariffs, noted the Journal. Economists envision tariffs could boost inflation. If tariffs push up consumer prices, businesses and individuals might be primed to react by hoarding products or paying more, they argue. Tariffs could go up “in the context of an economy where the embers of inflation are still smoldering,” KPMG chief economist Diane Swonk told the New York Times. “It can rekindle.” On December 18, the Dow plunged 1,100 points after the Fed signaled fewer 2025 rate cuts than investors expected. If inflation rekindles, the Fed could stop cutting rates — or even raise them. “Today was a closer call, but we decided it was the right call,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a news conference after the Federal Open Market Committee's meeting. He later added, “From here, it’s a new phase, and we’re going to be cautious about further cuts,” according to the Wall Street Journal, Investors did not take into account how the Fed’s forecast might change in light of the election results. One economist concluded the Fed’s slower rate of interest rate cuts was a result of uncertainties related to tariffs and immigration policies. “This wholesale change in their views are clearly tied to uncertainty and risks around as-yet-enacted tariff and immigration policies and have far less to do with changes to the economic landscape,” Inflation Insights Founder Omair Sharif told the Journal. Economists are uncertain about the rate of economic growth. “It is a very uncertain outlook, and most of that uncertainty comes from potential changes in policy,” Morgan Stanley’s chief U.S. economist Michael Gapen told the Times. Nevertheless, Morgan Stanley and other Wall Street economists forecast gross domestic product growth will slow from 2.5% in 2024 to 2% in 2025. While rising stock prices and higher home prices could boost consumer spending — which accounts for 70% of economic growth, tariffs and stricter immigration policies could increase prices. Such stagflation — slower growth and higher prices — is the worst case scenario of one economist. “Trade and immigration policy could be extremely disruptive to the economy,” American Enterprise Institute economist Michael Strain told the Times. Strain envisions a stagflation scenario in which prices — of imported goods, groceries, restaurant meals, and homes — rise as economic growth slows. The reason? “Steep new tariffs discourage investment, mass deportations limit employers’ ability to find workers and mounting deficits drive up borrowing costs,” reported the Times. Finally, just as subprime mortgage-backed securities found their way into the financial mainstream — contributing to the 2008 financial crisis — there is a risk of bitcoin and other risky tokens doing something similar in the future. Bitcoin more than doubled in 2024 and popped 40% since November 5 on “hopes that a second Trump administration will usher in a golden age for digital currencies,” reported the Wall Street Journal. Individual investors are pouring cash into exchange traded funds linked to cryptocurrencies. Such ETFs — notably from Fidelity and BlackRock — have attracted $36 billion of new money since their launch — with their assets totaling about $116 billion, the Journal noted. ETFs get paid to accumulate assets in classes investors desire. “Asset managers’ jobs are to build products where there is demand from their clients so they can charge fees on it,” ETF Action Founder Mike Akins, told the Journal. “Let us not forget they also had no problem packaging up subprime mortgages and delivering them to their clients.” Could the inherent volatility of bitcoin and other risky tokens clip those investors’ wings and cause another financial crisis? The involvement of Fidelity and BlackRock gives me little comfort about the safety of bitcoin as an investment. After all, Akins’ comment reminds me how Lehman Brothers — which accumulated a highly leverage portfolio of subprime mortgage-backed securities — was a respected investment bank until Sept. 15, 2008 when it filed a $639 billion bankruptcy. The median Wall Street forecast sees a 9% rise in the S&P 500 in 2025, according to MarketWatch. While I hope I am wrong, tariffs, inflation, higher-than-expected interest rates, slower economic growth, and bitcoin volatility risk could make that forecast look overly optimistic. One Community.

Title: A Teenager’s Lawsuit: Taking on the Global Food Giants. Colin Todhunter

Time Published: 2024-12-20T14:03:02Z
Full Content:
In a bold move, 18-year-old Bryce Martinez from Pennsylvania has taken a stand against some of the world’s largest food corporations. Martinez has filed a groundbreaking lawsuit against 11 major food companies, including household names like Coca-Cola, Nestlé and Kraft Heinz, alleging that their ultra-processed foods (UPFs) led to his development of Type 2 diabetes and fatty liver disease at the age of 16. This legal action brings to light the growing concern over UPFs, which are foods that have undergone multiple processing steps and often contain additives, preservatives, and artificial ingredients. These products, ranging from sugary cereals to packaged snacks and soft drinks, have become staples in many households, particularly appealing to children and teenagers. Martinez’s lawsuit argues that these companies have engaged in practices reminiscent of the tobacco industry, prioritising profits over the health of young consumers. His legal team contends that the food giants have exploited children’s vulnerability to marketing and their natural preference for sweet and salty flavours. It argues that these companies have deliberately engineered their products to trigger addictive responses, making it difficult for young consumers to resist or moderate their intake. The case details Martinez’s personal story, describing how he regularly consumed popular UPFs throughout his childhood, unaware of the potential long-term health consequences. His diagnosis with Type 2 diabetes and fatty liver disease at 16 came as a shock, prompting him to investigate the root causes of his health issues. This lawsuit raises important questions about the food system in the face of rising childhood obesity and diabetes rates. It challenges the food industry’s long-standing defence that consumers have free choice in their dietary decisions. Martinez’s lawyers argue that when it comes to children, this notion of free choice is compromised by aggressive marketing tactics and the addictive nature of these products. The case also highlights the growing awareness of the link between diet and long-term health outcomes. Public health advocates have long warned about the potential dangers of a diet high in UPFs, but this lawsuit brings these concerns into the legal arena in an unprecedented way. The case draws parallels to the landmark tobacco lawsuits of the past, which resulted in significant changes to how cigarettes were marketed and sold. If successful, Martinez’s lawsuit could have similar far-reaching implications for the food industry, potentially leading to stricter regulations on food marketing, more transparent labelling practices and a shift in public perception of UPFs. Moreover, this case may inspire other individuals or groups to take similar legal action, potentially opening the floodgates for a wave of lawsuits against food companies. This could force coopted governments and the industry to reckon with their role in the global obesity epidemic and other diet-related health issues. While Martinez’s lawsuit focuses on the direct health impacts of UPFs on individuals, it’s crucial to understand this case within the broader context of the global food system. This is something I have been drawing attention to for many years, offering a critical lens through which to examine how the industrial food system, driven by profit motives, perpetuates health crises, environmental degradation and socio-economic harm. The rise of UPFs is emblematic of a food system shaped by capitalist imperatives. These foods, often laced with harmful chemicals and produced using toxic agrochemicals, are not only detrimental to health but also highly profitable for corporations. The same companies that dominate the UPF market are deeply intertwined with investment firms like BlackRock and Vanguard, which also hold stakes in the pharmaceutical industry. This dual investment creates a cycle where corporations profit from both the sale of harmful foods and the treatment of diseases caused by these products—a ‘win-win’ scenario for them but a devastating one for public health. A complex web of influence shapes global food policies and scientific research. Any talk about corporate influence and lobbying must include the role of the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI). Despite claiming to be an independent scientific organisation, the ILSI functions as a powerful lobby group for the food industry. The ILSI plays a crucial role in promoting narratives that benefit its corporate funders, often at the expense of public health. We have a food system where corporate lobbying exerts significant influence over policies and ensures harmful practices remain largely unchecked. The proliferation of UPFs has been linked to rising rates of non-communicable diseases such as obesity, diabetes and heart disease. In high-income countries like the United States and the United Kingdom, UPFs account for more than half of total calorific intake, exacerbating these health issues. Yet corporate-backed narratives often downplay these risks or frame them as issues of personal responsibility rather than systemic problems. High-level ‘experts’ and scientists with ties to major food corporations have argued against demonising UPFs, despite overwhelming evidence linking them to poor health outcomes. Addressing the harms caused by UPFs requires more than individual lawsuits — it demands a rethinking of how food is produced, marketed and regulated. Bryce Martinez’s lawsuit against food corporations represents a critical challenge to a system that thrives on ‘sickening profits’. This case is part of a larger struggle against a global food system that prioritises corporate wealth and power over health and food sovereignty. Whether through legal action or the work of grassroots movements, dismantling and rejecting this harmful system is essential for creating a healthier and more equitable future. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article to your friends and colleagues.

Title: Middle East – Towards Endless Chaos?
URL: https://www.globalresearch.ca/middle-east-endless-chaos/5875360
Time Published: 2024-12-20T14:00:45Z
Full Content:
Update as of December 22, 8:18 AM ET: Since the article below was published, the US has apparently increased its troops stationed in Syria from 900 to at least 2,000. The Pentagon / NATO also has at least one aircraft carrier stationed in the Mediterranean Sea and at least two in the Gulf, thus encircling the Middle East by sea, air and land. Clearly, the US -still self-styled Empire- does not want to let go of the “Jewel” called the Middle East, loaded with 55% to 60% of the world’s energy resources; or better, and maybe even more importantly called, the “becoming” of Greater Israel for the Chosen People. This second point is not to be neglected. It is funded by those who have created and control the international monetary system, and reign over the worldwide money flow. We are talking of various quadrillions of US dollars-equivalent. *** With the Ashkenazi-Zionist-Israel rapid expansion towards a Greater Israel, the sudden fall of Syria, the silence of Iraq, Iran scared to intervene, when Russia is folding up its tents in Syria and is getting the hell out of there — what else, but chaos? See also this analysis by Paul Craig Roberts. Well, the West’s unquestioned support for Israel, or what is still called Israel, though in the hands of mass murderers going by the name of Ashkenazi-Zionist – no original Jews, what can be expected from the region, other than an ever-faster downfall into full chaos? Chaos is usually what the rulers want. That is what Washington manages best. The US-Pentagon-NATO have a long history of letting chaos reign for control. This time though it seems to be different. The chaos is happening because of the West’s collective inaction; possibly negligence of their own interests. Just to be sure, Syria has not collapsed because of an “internal” civil war. There NEVER was a civil war; a civil war as we know by its true term where the local people rise up against their ruler. That never happened. Never listen to western media, which would like you to believe that Bashar al-Assad was fighting against a country full of Syrians who disliked him. That is a load of bull***t, as strong as it comes. Mr. al-Assad’s Syria was infiltrated since before the year 2000, still during his father Hafez Assad’s reign by US-UK-Israeli created terror groups, which lasted up to this day, plus new ones, to which Turkey later also contributed. Today they are called ISIS, IS, al-Qaeda, and finally by Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a coalition of northern Syria-based Sunni Islamist insurgent groups that evolved from Jabhat al-Nusrah, or “Nusrah Front,” al-Qaeda’s former branch in Syria. For sure there are others. For now, HTS seems to be in control of Syria, if anybody is. Turkey, the flip-flop nation, a so-called NATO heavyweight claiming to be also friends with Russia – but when it comes down to it, Turkey under Erdogan is a traitor of everyone. Erdogan has dreams of grandeur, to bring back the Ottoman Empire. Should he ever be trusted? Washington wanted to dominate Syria for decades. Why? Her oil riches are much larger than is being officially estimated, her geographic strategic situation is unique to control the region – and not least, Syria is part of the Zionists’ dream of becoming the Greater Israel, the Land for the Chosen People. One can only wonder, what kind of God would choose such horrifying people? Syria is central to the downfall of the entire Middle East. That descent into chaos has started long ago, but accelerated to warp speed in the past weeks. It may go on for an undetermined period of time. It will affect Iran, though Iran, a new BRICS country and part of the Chinese Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), is expected to have Russian and Chinese support. However, recent events have shown that none of this can be taken for granted. So, for practical reasons Iran is on her own, internally still torn apart between the adherents of western values and those who trust the east. Of course, the western faction is heavily paid, infiltrated and trained by CIA and associated secret services to foment resistance and, if needed, facilitate assassinations of (western) undesirable leaders. And what about the Saudis? They are selling their hydrocarbons to China in Yuan, an indication that they would lean towards the East, China. However, when a year ago they were offered a place in the new BRICS, though they had officially accepted, but as of today they have not fulfilled any of the conditions laid out for the BRICS members. For example, they are adamant not letting go of the US dollar, not meaning de-dollarization, but trading among each other in their respective currencies. De-dollarization was never a condition for BRICS membership. But the sheer fact of being a member of the BRICS, pulling them closer to China and Russia, scares them. Remember, they are full with US military bases – a tit-for-tat – when they agreed in the 1970s as head of OPEC to trade hydrocarbons only in US dollars, Washington promised to “protect” them from potential enemies by dotting their country with US bases. The very bases from which the US is aggressing her chosen enemies, not only in the Middle East, but all over the world. The population of the Middle East is about half a billion people (2024 estimate), and growing. That is only about 6% of the world’s population but extremely rich in natural resources, including energies. . . Does anybody expect these people just to let go, being overrun and their resources – the world’s energy – being stolen by supremacists, who call themselves the Chosen People, without a fight? Not likely. What incoming President Trump will do to bring Peace to the Middle East is anybody’s guess. From the supposed key positions to be confirmed, with responsibilities for the Middle East, including his VP and Secretary of State – and others of course – the course of unquestioned support for Israel, or let’s call it by the true name, the Ashkenazi-Zionists, seems guaranteed. Mr. Trump has not made any indication that he wants Peace with Iran. That pits East against West in the Middle East which controls as it is today, between 55% and 60% of all known hydrocarbon reserves. Many countries around the globe depend on these reserves. For the foreseeable future the world’s economies are not going to be run by alternative “renewable” energy, like windmills or solar panels. By now, most people know that this is a joke. The climate hoax behind it is also about to collapse. The Green Deal people will soon get a hefty blow. Financial giants like BlackRock / Vanguard are clearly distancing themselves from this lie. Syria was a shining light in the region. But for most, she was unexpectedly overrun with apparent ease. All prepared for over 30 years, already when Hafez al-Assad was in power, the US started meddling. They intensified their interference in the early 2000 with a supposed pipeline from Qatar through Syria, which was probably planned by the US in connivance with Qatar, knowing that Syria would never allow it to protect her ally’s, Russia, gas market in Europe. But it gave the US yet another argument to further destabilize Syria. Chaos, upheaval and destruction; murdering of the worst kind in Syria of anybody who can still be linked to Bashar al-Assad. Human rights abuse, torture no end. Listen to this remarkable discussion between Mike Robinson and Vanessa Beeley about the events of the past week in Syria, including Vanessa’s escape from the terrorists (50-min podcast): Alternatively, you may listen here. The west is cheering, and the rest of the world is just looking on. Now the total downfall, total chaos of the Middle East is almost a given. Will Trump want to find a solution? The world needs a peace-loving leader from the East or from the West. Not a globalist, because globalists want Power not Peace. The current chaos is what the west wants – the US, UK, Europe, Israel and even Turkey. But it is doubtful that chaos in the Middle East would be in the long-term interest of the self-proclaimed masters of the universe. Somalia may be a good example of man-made chaos and kept as continued chaos. For decades Somalia has followed a similar pattern as is now inflicted in the Middle East. When it gets out of hand, and risks to spread to other areas and countries, inconvenient to the west, the US air force comes in on a flash, dropping a few bombs until the chaos becomes normal and manageable again. Will President Trump leave Syria to the old terror groups set up by the US et al. in the first place – and new ones to be created, which arm themselves largely from the weapons shipments to Ukraine, of which at least 70% goes directly to the black market, already reported on over a year ago by BBC and CNN? Some analyst-pundits predict that 30 to 50 years from now, the Middle East may become a nuclear-contaminated, uninhabitable, literally untouchable piece of land. Let us hope this can be avoided. If a genuine peace-leader, either from the west or the east, were to intervene in the Middle East by stopping the Zionists’ march towards a Greater Israel, restoring old frontiers, giving back Palestine to the Palestinians, there is a chance that the Middle East could become a viable partner to the rest of the world — with the hydrocarbon reserves continuing driving the world economy, towards a civilization of shared values and shared benefits. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article to your friends and colleagues.

Title: SEC Greenlights First Combo Bitcoin-Ethereum ETFs From Hashdex And Franklin Templeton

After multiple delayed reviews, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has finally given its regulatory greenlight the first spot exchange-traded funds tracking both Bitcoin and Ethereum. The approval extends the access of traditional institutional investors to the two largest crypto assets through spot-based investment products. According to a Dec. 19 notice, the Securities and Exchange Commission approved the Hashdex Crypto Index US ETF, which will trade on the Nasdaq stock market. The Wall Street top financial cop also greenlighted the Franklin Crypto Index ETF to be listed on the Cboe BZX Exchange. “The proportion of bitcoin and ether to be held by each Trust will be based on free-float market capitalizations,” the notice reads. Franklin Templeton’s updated filing, submitted earlier on Wednesday, was approved on an “accelerated basis” due to compliance with existing commodity-based trust share structures. The SEC also stated that the proposals satisfied the criteria of the Exchange Act, which requires ETF providers to have sufficient rules to deter fraudulent and manipulative actions and protect investors, among other requirements. Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, observed in an X post that it would be “interesting” to see if other issuers, including Wall Street giant BlackRock, will seek to introduce similar investment products following the SEC’s recent approval. “Regardless, I expect there will be meaningful demand for these products. Advisors LOVE diversification. Especially in an emerging asset class such as crypto,” Geraci added. The regulatory green light comes amid a Federal Reserve-spurred crypto market rout. The leading cryptocurrency has fallen over 7.5% on the day to $94,301 as of press time. Solana’s SOL, ETH, and Cardano’s ADA have dropped as much as 17.2%. Meanwhile, the OG meme coin Dogecoin has tumbled by 20.6% over the last 24 hours at a current price of around $0.2861.

Title: Uber Technologies, Inc. (UBER): Among Tiger Global Management’s Long-Term Stock Picks

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Tiger Global's 15 Long-Term Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) stands against the other stock picks. Even as the venture capital efforts of Tiger Global Management come under increased scrutiny on the back of reportedly disappointing post-pandemic performance, the 13F portfolio of the fund seems to be performing exceedingly well to taper over these concerns. From the beginning of 2023 through to the end of the first quarter of 2024, the public long positions of the fund returned more than 80% to investors. These were dominated by prominent stakes in hyperscalers riding the AI boom. The rate of return posted by the fund was more than double the returns of the benchmark S&P 500 over the period. In contrast, a recent report by news publication Bloomberg reveals that the sixteenth private markets fund of Tiger Global, which set out with a target to raise more than $6 billion in funding back in 2022, closed with $2.2 billion in funding earlier this year. Tech news platform TechCrunch reports that the VC efforts of Tiger Global are suffering from a reputation of making bad bets during the pandemic. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Even though perfectly-timed bets on tech stocks are the claim to fame for Tiger Global in the past few years, a team from the fund recently noted in an investor letter that 30% of its exposure sits in businesses other than the AI-driven tech sector. Per the fund, these positions have roughly doubled over the last fifteen months with an 80% hit rate. Compared to these astute bets, the venture capital efforts of the company paint a grimmer picture. For example, a recent report by the California State Teachers’ Retirement System reveals that the paper losses on the fifteen private markets fund stood at more than 15% at the end of June 2024. This fund had raised more than $12.7 billion back in 2021 to invest in high growth areas. Data from PitchBook Benchmarks shows that the steep losses of this fund place it in the bottom 10% of all venture funds raised in 2021. However, there is still time for some of these investments to bear fruit in the long term. The investment team at Tiger Global is certainly losing no sleep over these numbers. In a letter to investors, the fund has noted that the private holdings of the fund generated positive returns in the first quarter of 2024. This year, the VC arm of Tiger Global has invested in many prominent startups, including Waymo, OpenAI, Scale AI and Wiz. The Tiger Global team stressed in the letter that a meaningful portion of the private exposure of the public fund is concentrated in global market leaders who are performing well and awaiting attractive opportunities to go public. The team further added that it was also encouraged by the signs of life in the IPO market following relative dormancy over the last two years.

For this article, we selected stocks by combing through the 13F portfolio of Tiger Global Management at the end of the third quarter of 2024. Only the companies that have been in the 13F portfolio of the fund consistently for the past three years were selected. These stocks are also popular among other hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close up view of a hand holding a smartphone, using a ride sharing app. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 136 Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) develops and operates proprietary technology applications worldwide. Even though the fund trimmed its stake in the company by 14% in the past few months, the firm is still one of the top long term stock picks of Tiger Global. It has featured in the 13F portfolio of the fund constantly since the second quarter of 2019. At the end of the third quarter of 2024, Tiger Global owned close to 2.6 million shares in the ride hailing firm worth close to $200 million, representing 0.83% of the portfolio. Just like Tiger Global, Wall Street analysts are also bullish on Uber Technologies, Inc.(NYSE:UBER). Investment bank Goldman Sachs recently termed the firm as one of its top stock picks for 2025. In an investor note, Goldman analyst Eric Sheridan said Uber's risk-to-reward balance was among the most attractive heading into 2025. Sheridan highlighted that Uber was mired in a series of short-term debates, including discussion on pricing inflation and competition impact on mobility growth, as well as medium/long-term industry concerns over the impact of autonomous vehicles on supply/demand if not outright disintermediation. Against that backdrop, we see a company that can continue to deliver on its February 2024 Investor Day commitments despite the rise of autonomous vehicles, countered Sheridan. Overall UBER ranks 9th on our list of Tiger Global Management's long-term stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of UBER as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than UBER but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Is Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) a Cheap NYSE Stock to Invest in Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Cheap NYSE Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE:XOM) stands against other cheap NYSE stocks to invest in now. The stock market appears poised for another year of impressive returns, likely extending into 2025. However, concerns about high valuations persist. To gain insight into this, Aswath Damodaran, professor of finance at NYU Stern School of Business, recently joined CNBC’s ‘Closing Bell’ on December 14. Damodaran recognized that it’s tough to keep up after two years of returns over 25%. He mentioned that if the market stays stable until the end of the year, it would be similar to the high points seen in the 1950s and mid-1970s. However, he was doubtful about being able to keep this strong performance going, as it’s challenging to continue rising after such big gains. When asked if the market is overvalued, Damodaran said that while prices are high, they haven’t reached the level of a bubble yet. He compared the current situation to the late 1990s but clarified that he doesn’t plan to sell all his investments. Instead, he is hesitant to invest cash right away because staying in cash might mean losing out on potential gains. He also mentioned that while there may be limited growth in price-to-earnings ratios in 2025, there could still be good returns due to better-than-expected earnings growth from new government policies. Damodaran believes that a return of 8% to 10% would be satisfactory for him, as he prioritizes preserving wealth over aiming for very high returns. The US stock market currently presents a mixed valuation picture. According to Morningstar, Large growth stocks have experienced significant price appreciation. However, their current valuations may not fully reflect the inherent risks associated with high growth expectations and potential competition. Consumer defensive stocks tend to be less volatile during economic downturns, but the current valuations may be inflated due to a perceived safe-haven status. Utilities may be currently overvalued relative to their historical performance and future earnings potential as interest rates rise. The industrial sector may be overvalued due to concerns about potential economic slowdowns and rising input costs, although some sub-sectors may offer value. Conversely, the communication services sector may present attractive opportunities for investors. While facing challenges such as increased competition and regulatory scrutiny, certain companies within this sector may be undervalued relative to their long-term growth prospects. The energy sector has experienced significant volatility in recent years. However, with increasing global energy demand and ongoing geopolitical uncertainties, certain segments of the energy sector may be undervalued at current prices. Markets are constantly evolving, influenced by various factors such as economic growth, interest rates, and geopolitical events. Damodaran’s insights reflect a cautious view of market prospects heading into 2025, emphasizing careful investment strategies amid high valuations. We sifted through the Finviz stock screener to compile a list of the top NYSE-listed stocks.

(NYSE:XOM) is a global leader in the oil and gas industry. It focuses on upstream operations, which encompass the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas. It is also a major producer of a variety of advanced plastics, including polypropylene and polyethylene. Its third-quarter 2024 earnings of $8.6 billion were driven in part by the successful integration of Pioneer Natural Resources, a major independent oil and gas exploration and production company in the US which is primarily focused on the Permian Basin in Texas. Exxon Mobil Corp.’s (NYSE:XOM) Upstream segment’s year-to-date 2024 earnings doubled compared to 2019 to reach $10.00 per oil-equivalent barrel. This is attributed to the acquisition of Pioneer, which added 770,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of high-quality production to the company’s portfolio. Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE:XOM) leverages its technology and Pioneer’s Permian Basin acreage for efficiency gains. Industry-leading laterals (including a recent 18,250-foot well and planned 20,000-foot well) reduce well counts, minimize surface impact, and improve capital efficiency. This drives Upstream success and strong shareholder returns. Overall, XOM ranks 6th on our list of cheap NYSE stocks to invest in now.
