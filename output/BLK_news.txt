Ethereum (ETH) treasury firm BitMine Immersion Technologies today announced that it had bought another 203,800 ETH last week. Following its latest purchase, the firm’s total ETH holdings now stand 3.24 million tokens. According to a press release issued earlier today, BitMine Immersion Technologies, a leading Ethereum treasury firm has further increased its ETH holdings. The firm added another 203,800 ETH over the last week, worth approximately $820 million. Last week’s purchase has increased BitMine’s total ETH holdings to 3.24 million ETH, representing roughly 2.7% of the active circulating supply. In addition, the company holds 192 Bitcoin (BTC) and $219 in cash. The firm has $1.34 billion in combined crypto and cash holdings. BitMine’s frequent ETH purchases have propelled it as the leading public company in terms of ETH held on its balance sheet. Earlier this month, the firm had reported that its total ETH holdings had surpassed 3 million tokens. Commenting, Tom Lee, Chairman of BitMine said: The crypto market saw one of its largest deleveraging events ever last week and this put downward pressure on ETH prices. Open interest for ETH sits at the same levels as seen on June 30th of this year. Given the expected Supercycle for ethereum, this price dislocation represents an attractive risk/reward. We acquired 203,826 ETH tokens over the past week pushing our ETH holdings to 3.24 million, or 2.7% of the supply of ETH. We are now more than halfway towards our initial pursuit of the ‘alchemy of 5%’ of ETH. Lee added that he sees Ethereum as a “truly neutral” blockchain which is likely to witness growing institutional adoption. He added that BitMine remains committed to accumulating 5% of Ethereum’s total circulating supply. Following today’s announcement, the NYSE-listed firm’s stock BMNR surged an impressive 7.76%, trading at $53.72 at the time of writing. The stock is up an astonishing 640.87% over the past six months. As institutional adoption of Ethereum grows, analysts are predicting new all-time highs (ATH) for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. According to crypto analyst HAMED_AZ, ETH can surge to $6,400 on the back of a new bullish wave. Recent trends show that some institutional investors are even replacing BTC with ETH, due to the latter’s greater flexibility and wider variety of uses. Major asset manager, BlackRock recently shifted some of its BTC holdings to ETH. That said, some analysts are cautious of the trend of Ethereum treasury firms adding ETH on their balance sheets. At press time, ETH trades at $4,019, up 1.2% in the past 24 hours. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Anthropic Expands Claude Code to Web and iOS for Cloud Coding
URL: https://www.iphoneincanada.ca/2025/10/20/anthropic-expands-claude-code-to-web-and-ios-for-cloud-coding/
Time Published: 2025-10-20T21:55:04Z
Full Content:
AI startup Anthropic is bringing its AI coding assistant Claude Code to the web and iOS, giving developers a way to run coding jobs straight from their browser or phone. The new tool, now in beta, lets users offload tasks like bug fixes, backend tweaks, or documentation updates—all handled in the cloud. Developers can connect GitHub repositories, describe what they need, and watch as Claude codes in real time inside a secure, isolated sandbox. Each task runs independently with live progress updates, and multiple jobs can run in parallel across different projects. When done, Claude automatically generates pull requests and change summaries. The iOS version offers a mobile-friendly way to steer code sessions on the go, though Anthropic says it’s an early preview meant for testing and feedback. Security-wise, all sessions are locked down in sandboxed environments with strict network limits. Git actions go through a secure proxy to ensure Claude only touches approved repositories. Developers can even whitelist domains—for example, to allow package downloads for testing. With this release, Anthropic is clearly signaling it wants Claude Code to become more than a chat-based helper—it’s positioning it as a full-fledged AI pair programmer in the cloud, available anywhere you work. Check out the promo video below: Anthropic has raised billions in funding, with its most recent $13 billion US Series F round in September 2025—valuing it at whopping $183 billion US—led by Iconiq, Fidelity Management & Research, and Lightspeed Venture Partners. Key earlier backers include $4 billion from Amazon in 2023 and $2 billion from Google, alongside investors like Bessemer Venture Partners, Menlo Ventures, General Catalyst, Cisco Investments, and over 80 others such as BlackRock.

Title: BlackRock launches Bitcoin ETP in London

Time Published: 2025-10-20T21:30:21Z

BlackRock’s latest move brings regulated Bitcoin exposure to UK investors for the first time. The iShares Bitcoin ETP (IB1T) opened strong on the LSE. BlackRock’s IB1T launched on the London Stock Exchange, giving UK retail investors direct access to Bitcoin. The launch follows the FCA’s policy shift, allowing retail access to crypto-linked products. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETP [IB1T] is now live on the London Stock Exchange [LSE]. This marks a key milestone for retail investors seeking regulated exposure to Bitcoin in the UK. The move signals both a policy shift from British regulators and BlackRock’s growing dominance in the digital-asset investment space. According to data from BlackRock’s official listing page, IB1T opened trading on 20 October 2025 at $11.10, climbing 5.54% on its first day. The exchange-traded product (ETP) is physically backed by Bitcoin. It offers investors direct exposure to the asset’s spot price without needing to hold or custody BTC themselves. BlackRock said the product carries a total expense ratio (TER) of 0.15% per annum until 31 December 2025, after which it will rise to 0.25%. The firm confirmed the ETP complies with UK regulatory requirements and maintains its reserves through regulated custodians. The launch follows the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) decision to relax rules that had previously blocked retail participation in crypto-linked products. By approving products like IB1T, the UK is signaling a more pragmatic approach toward digital-asset investment. This aligns it with the U.S. and European markets that already allow similar instruments. The move also comes as Bitcoin trades around $110,000, recovering from recent volatility that briefly sent prices below $104,000. The renewed institutional inflows from newly launched products could help stabilize BTC’s trajectory and re-anchor market confidence. BlackRock’s debut places it among a growing list of European Bitcoin ETP issuers, including WisdomTree, 21Shares, and CoinShares, all of which operate similar products across Germany, Switzerland, and France. Traditional financial heavyweights are now competing head-to-head in Europe’s maturing digital-asset market, where regulation is fast becoming a competitive advantage. The new listing adds to BlackRock’s expanding digital-asset portfolio. Its portfolio includes a U.S.-listed Bitcoin ETF, an Ethereum ETP, and the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL). With the UK now opening the door to mainstream crypto investing, BlackRock’s move shows the growing convergence between traditional finance and blockchain-based assets. The iShares Bitcoin ETP could become a benchmark product for retail Bitcoin exposure in one of the world’s oldest and most influential financial centers.

Title: Bitcoin and Ethereum ETPs Available to UK Users via Blackrock, 21Shares, and Others

© 2025 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. BlackRock, 21Shares, WisdomTree, and Bitwise have listed Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) ETPs on the London Stock Exchange as FCA lifts the ban. Top global asset managers like BlackRock, 21Shares, WisdomTree, and Bitwise have opened access to Bitcoin BTC $108 063 24h volatility: 0.1% Market cap: $2.16 T Vol. 24h: $108.17 B and Ethereum ETH $3 861 24h volatility: 0.7% Market cap: $466.42 B Vol. 24h: $45.65 B exchange-traded products that are available to UK retail investors. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF will be listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE), with its shares physically backed by BTC and held via Coinbase. The BlackRock Bitcoin ETF has already been a massive success in the US, becoming the fastest ETF in history to approach $100 billion AUM, within 18 months of launch. Speaking on the development, Jane Sloan, EMEA head of global product solutions at BlackRock, said: “Built on institutional-grade infrastructure, [the product] enables UK investors to gain exposure to bitcoin with the confidence of robust custody and regulatory oversight.” The development comes 12 days after the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) lifted its four-year ban on retail access to crypto exchange-traded notes (ETNs). As a result, this has opened the market to a wider investor base. Apart from BlackRock, other asset managers have also joined the listing race. On Monday, October 20, 21Shares listed two physically backed products for Bitcoin and Ethereum on the London Stock Exchange (LSE). It also includes a staking component for its Ethereum ETPs and a reduced 0.1% management fee for select offerings. The announcement comes as the asset manager also pushes for spot Dogecoin ETF approval in the US. 21Shares first launched its crypto ETPs for institutional investors in the UK last year, capturing 70% of total turnover on the London Stock Exchange (LSE), according to the company. Meanwhile, WisdomTree has listed its physically backed Bitcoin and Ethereum ETPs on the LSE with fees of 0.15% and 0.35%. This also follows its earlier institutional offering in the UK. Asset manager Bitwise also announced plans to list its Bitcoin and Ethereum ETPs on the LSE on Tuesday, with a reduced 0.05% fee on its Core Bitcoin ETP for at least six months. Back in 2021, UK’s top financial regulator FCA, had banned the sale, marketing, and distribution of crypto derivatives and exchange-traded notes (ETNs) to retail investors. With the latest policy shift, retail investors can now access these products through UK-regulated brokers and investment platforms, such as standard brokerage accounts and tax-efficient wrappers like ISAs and SIPPs, WisdomTree said on Monday. The update brings the UK’s regulatory framework closer in line with markets such as the U.S., Canada, Hong Kong, and the EU. However, the prohibition on retail access to broader crypto derivatives remains in effect. Disclaimer: Coinspeaker is committed to providing unbiased and transparent reporting.

Title: $1.2B exits US Bitcoin ETFs just as London makes crypto comeback

$600B in futures inflow could be on the horizon as analysts say Europe’s new ETNs could ignite the next wave of mainstream inflows. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The 12 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETFs) in the United States reversed sharply last week, recording $1.2 billion in net outflows. According to SoSoValue data, this was their second-largest weekly setback since launching in January 2024. The pullback snapped a two-week run of inflows that had brought in more than $5 billion, a period many read as proof of deepening institutional conviction. Data from SoSoValue show that investors pulled capital from nearly every major issuer. BlackRock’s IBIT recorded a $276 million outflow, while Fidelity’s FBTC saw $169 million leave. Other major issuers, such as ARK Invest’s ARKB and Bitwise’s BITB, lost $290 million and $128 million, respectively, while Grayscale’s two funds shed $321 million. The reversal followed a volatile week for Bitcoin, which briefly dipped below $104,000 during the reporting period. Notably, this was its lowest price level since June. Industry experts linked the drawdown to macroeconomic conditions triggered by US-China tariff wars, that shook confidence in risk assets like Bitcoin. However, the flagship digital crypto asset has rebounded strongly above $110,000 as of press time amid recent developments in the market. While US flows turned defensive, a different story that would reshape retail access for Bitcoin was unfolding across the Atlantic. On Oct. 20, Bitcoin exchange-traded notes (ETNs) officially began trading on the London Stock Exchange. This marks the end of the UK’s three-year retail ban on crypto investment products. BlackRock led the debut with its iShares Bitcoin ETP, joined by other leading issuers like Bitwise. Meanwhile, early feedback about these products has been mixed, but they have still shown promising signs. ByteTree founder Charlie Morris said initial trading activity showed “success with platforms such as Interactive Investor, Swissquote, and Trading 212,” though some brokers like AJ Bell were slower to support access. Still, Bradley Duke, Bitwise’s head of Europe, opined that the launch of these products would mark a “big week” for retail investors because the “direction of travel is clear for crypto.” With a new wave of adoption emerging across the Atlantic and renewed institutional focus on Bitcoin, Galaxy Research believes that crypto investment products could attract up to $600 billion in new inflows as traditional financial institutions broaden distribution. According to the firm, the US advisory market represents a vast, largely untapped opportunity that would drive significant flows into BTC. It stated: “Roughly 300,000 financial advisors manage about $30 trillion in client assets. If even a modest 2% allocation to bitcoin ETFs emerged across this channel, that would translate to roughly $600 billion in potential inflows.” These wave of flows would would rival the entire global gold ETF market, now worth about $472 billion, and quadruple the combined $146 billion in assets under management (AUM) across US spot Bitcoin funds. The asset management firm pointed out that recent policy moves by leading traditional financial institiutions like Morgan Stanley and Vanguard support that thesis. Notably, Morgan Stanley recently recommended up to a 4% allocation to digital assets, while Vanguard is reportedly looking to offer select third-party crypto ETFs to its brokerage clients. These developments are expected to drive fresh capital into the emerging industry and further drive Bitcoin’s adoption. Galaxy Research argued that the full opening of large advisory platforms could mark a structural shift in how digital assets are integrated into mainstream finance. Once this access is fully enabled, financial advisors will be able to include crypto directly within traditional balanced portfolios, moving the asset class from retail-driven speculation toward advisor-led portfolio construction. It noted: “The impact could be substantial. New inflows may follow as wealth managers begin allocating to the asset class, potentially pushing total bitcoin ETF AUM to $500 billion within a few years, assuming just a 1% average allocation across managed portfolios. Such flows would reshape market dynamics and reinforce bitcoin’s position as a mainstream, investable asset.” Galaxy’s analysis further suggested that this transition could also bring a more mature form of liquidity. According to the firm, advisory-driven allocations tend to follow longer holding periods and stricter compliance frameworks, reducing the short-term turnover that has defined retail crypto trading. Over time, that discipline could enhance price stability, deepen liquidity, and align Bitcoin more closely with traditional asset classes such as equities, bonds, and gold.

Title: Ethereum In, Bitcoin Out: BlackRock Rebalancing Its Digital Asset Portfolio In Major Crypto Shift
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-in-bitcoin-out/
Time Published: 2025-10-20T15:00:15Z
Full Content:
Following the recent market crash due to Donald Trump’s tariff order, the price of Bitcoin and Ethereum experienced a sharp decline below key support levels. While both coins fell strongly, ETH has emerged as the leading choice among major corporations, as these institutions swap their BTC for the altcoin leader. Major crypto assets such as Ethereum and Bitcoin are beginning to recover lost ground once again. Meanwhile, Ethereum appears to be leading the charge in terms of institutional adoption, reflecting the long-term potential of the leading altcoin. In a move that has triggered a frenzy across the crypto and traditional finance sectors, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is reportedly shifting a portion of its Bitcoin holdings into ETH. Coin Bureau shared this institutional pivot on the social media platform X, which has captured the attention of the crypto community. This daring rotation indicates a significant shift in institutional opinion and a rising belief in Ethereum’s sustained price growth. BlackRock‘s shift to ETH highlights the asset’s developing importance as the cornerstone of decentralized finance and next-generation financial infrastructure, even though Bitcoin keeps dominating as a store of value. Data shared by Coin Bureau reveals that the leading asset manager firm transferred about 272.4 BTC, valued at approximately $28.3 million, to Coinbase Prime. A few hours later, BlackRock was observed pulling out over 12,098 ETH worth $45.4 million. Bitmine Immersion Technologies Inc. has also been accumulating ETH at a significant and rapid rate. A recent report from BMNR Bullz shows that the leading treasury company purchased thousands of ETH within the past week to strengthen its digital asset treasury. Despite the recent market crash, the firm continues to double down on the altcoin, scooping up a total of 379,271 ETH, valued at $1.5 billion. With the massive purchase of Ethereum, Bitmine is demonstrating its conviction in the network’s expanding role in blockchain innovation. During the dip on Friday, Bitmine bought over 72,898 ETH worth $281 million. Three days prior to this acquisition, the firm purchased more than 104,336 ETH, valued at $417 million. Finally, a +202,037 ETH was made after the weekend crash, bringing the total to 379,271 ETH within a week. Bitmine’s persistent acquisition of the altcoin reflects the firm’s Co-CEO Tom Lee’s bold declaration that Ethereum will be the backbone of the digital economy. According to BMNR Bullz, this is not a buy signal, but a seismic shift. Prominent figures in the financial landscape are currently endorsing Ethereum. Robert Kiyosaki, a billionaire and author of the “Rich Dad Poor Dad” book, has included ETH as one of the key assets to hedge against the rising inflation across the world. While inflation keeps increasing and making it difficult for the poor and middle class, the billionaire has urged this set of people not to rely on government fake money or fiat currency. Instead, they should invest in Gold, Silver, Bitcoin, and Ethereum, which he labels the real money. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Lily Mae Lazarus is a news fellow at Fortune. Jim Edwards is the executive editor for global news at Fortune. He was previously the editor-in-chief of Business Insider's news division and the founding editor of Business Insider UK. His investigative journalism has changed the law in two U.S. federal districts and two states. The U.S. Supreme Court cited his work on the death penalty in the concurrence to Baze v. Rees, the ruling on whether lethal injection is cruel or unusual. He also won the Neal award for an investigation of bribes and kickbacks on Madison Avenue. On Oct. 15, two Wall Street titans offered radically different visions of the private credit market. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon warned investors that recent bankruptcies in private credit could be just the beginning: “When you see one cockroach, there are probably more.” Hours later, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink struck a defiant tone on his firm’s earnings call: “I’ve never been more excited about the future of BlackRock,” he said. BlackRock has bet $12 billion on private credit through its acquisition of HPS Investment Partners. So who is right? Investors have been so worried about the stability of private credit recently that their frantic selling drove up the VIX “fear” index by 35% over the past month. They are spooked by the collapse in September of Tricolor Holdings, a subprime auto lender and dealer, revealing allegations of fraud in which the company allegedly pledged the same collateral to multiple banks. Private credit was dealt another blow late last month when First Brands, an auto parts supplier, collapsed into bankruptcy, owing $10 billion, triggering federal investigations into $2.3 billion in missing funds. Then on Oct. 16, regional banks Zions Bancorporation disclosed fraud-related losses and Western Alliance flagged nearly nearly $100 million in alleged fraud, catalyzing a market rout that erased $100 billion in market cap from U.S. bank stocks and pushed market volatility to four-month highs. Major institutions tallied their damage: JPMorgan took $170 million in Tricolor losses; UBS disclosed over $500 million in First Brands exposure; and Jefferies revealed $715 million in questionable receivables. The private credit market—which has grown from $200 billion to $3 trillion globally in 15 years—suddenly looked vulnerable. But credit analysts and executives who spoke to Fortune have mixed views on Wall Street’s panic. Several argue that the failures aren’t private credit problems at all. According to them, these instances are traditional bank lending blowups, and the mislabeling reveals more about competitive tensions between old-guard banks and private credit disrupters than genuine systemic risk. The question, however, is whether these analysts are right, or whether they’re dangerously downplaying cracks in a $3 trillion market that is systemically important to global finance. The definition problem “First Brands, if it was rated by us, would not have been considered in any way, shape, or form a private credit transaction,” said Bill Cox, chief rating officer at Kroll Bond Rating Agency (KBRA), which tracks thousands of private credit loans. “Its main debt was full-on public, broadly syndicated loans.” This distinction matters. The broadly syndicated loan (BSL) market—dominated by large commercial banks—operates differently from the direct lending market that defines private credit. BSL loans are originated by banks, syndicated to multiple investors, and traded in public markets with daily pricing. Private credit loans, by contrast, are bilateral transactions between a lender and borrower, held to maturity in a “buy and hold” strategy with no secondary market trading. First Brands’ bankruptcy involved primarily BSL debt and receivables “factoring,” a form of lending where banks purchase a company’s accounts receivable at a discount in hopes of profiting later when clients pay their bills in full. Neither activity represents the core direct lending business that firms like Ares, Apollo, and Blackstone have built. “None of them do factoring,” Cox said of the dozens of private credit platforms his firm rates. “We looked at the entire universe of our CLOs, BDCs, and other facilities for exposure to First Brands. The exposure was de minimis,” he said, referring to collateralized loan obligations (bundles of loans sold to other investors) and business development companies (which are set up as investment bets on struggling or distressed companies). Brian Garfield, who heads U.S. portfolio valuation at investment banking firm Lincoln International, which performs over 6,500 quarterly valuations of private companies, echoed this view: “First Brands [largely had BSL facilities, and] that’s not the direct lending market. I think it’s important that we understand that alone in itself is really important, because there’s this whole combination of things that everyone is just putting … in one basket,” he told Fortune. The real state of private credit This isn’t to say private credit faces no challenges. Lincoln International’s proprietary data tracking the direct lending market shows covenant defaults—technical breaches of loan terms rather than payment failures—have risen from 2.2% in 2024 to 3.5% currently. Payment-in-kind (PIK) usage, where struggling borrowers defer cash interest payments, increased from 6.5% of deals in Q4 2021 to 11% today, with “bad PIKs” (repriced mid-deal) rising from 33% to over 50% of that total. “Are there cracks? Yes,” Garfield acknowledged. “But on average, are we seeing strong fundamental Ebitda growth? Yes.” His data shows last-12-months year-over-year Ebitda growth of 6% to 7%—the highest level since Q1 2021. KBRA’s analysis of 2,400 middle-market companies representing roughly $1 trillion in debt tells a similar story. Cox’s team projects defaults could peak at 5%, which he admitted is “a lot more than this industry has seen,” but he said was “relatively” low for public market comparables, the measure through which private company valuations can be derived by comparing the businesses to other similar companies that are already publicly traded on the stock market. Why the panic? Given the fundamentals aren’t catastrophic, analysts point to several factors beyond credit quality to explain investor anxiety, namely less stringent guardrails and documentation processes. “If something grows like a weed, maybe it is one,” Timur Braziler, who covers regional banks at Wells Fargo, told Fortune. “The availability of credit over the last five years, when you have more than one source competing for that same loan, maybe the underwriting isn’t as stringent.” Andrew Milgram, managing partner and chief investment officer of Marblegate Asset Management, an alternative investment firm focused on middle-market distressed and special situation investments, offered a more pointed critique: The competitive dynamics of unregulated lending inevitably lead to deteriorating standards. “When loans were done by banks, they were subject to oversight,” he explained. “As those loans moved out of the banking system into an unregulated environment, they began competing for business by loosening documentation, loosening underwriting standards.” Private credit loans are typically given out by nonbank lenders such as alternative asset managers, private equity firms, and pension funds. Without the guardrails and protections provided by traditional banks, who are beholden to regulators and the federal government, disaster can ensue, according to Milgram, who has long been skeptical of the private credit market. “Lending has been regulated in societies for all time. In fact, the Code of Hammurabi contemplated regulating lenders because every society, everywhere for all time has recognized that durable, responsible lending is central to the proper functioning of the economy,” he added. Cox sees a different dynamic at work: Competitive tensions between traditional banks and private credit upstarts have led to, in his opinion, a rise in misconstruing the overall risk of private credit and direct lending. “If your neighbor is saying it’s your dog that’s relieving itself on the lawn, and you know it’s not your dog, it’s pretty frustrating,” he says, noting that both Tricolor and First Brands were primarily bank lending failures, not private credit issues. He admits, however, that there are corners of the private credit market that are more exposed and involved in “riskier parts of credit,” where lenders provide loans at high risk in hopes of high returns. Private credit has a reputation for being directed at smaller, middle-market companies that are highly leveraged and potentially unable to secure traditional bank financing. While these firms may offer higher yields to offset the risk, they are more vulnerable to financial shocks. What comes next The debate over private credit’s risks won’t end with these bankruptcies. Braziler expects more fraud cases to emerge: “Just the abundance of credit, it makes sense that you’re going to have more of these bad characters.” However, he doesn’t see systemic risk to the banking sector. Tim Hynes, global head of credit research at Debtwire, expects continued stress but not catastrophe: “The weakest companies are starting to get hit as a result of the tariffs and economic slowdown. You’re going to see an increase in bankruptcies, but there isn’t systemic risk.” The real test may be transparency. Unlike BSL loans with daily market pricing, private credit valuations are less transparent, being updated quarterly using subjective methodologies. “It is really opaque,” Braziler notes. “It’s really hard to get a good understanding of who the end borrower is.” As BlackRock doubles down with its $12 billion HPS acquisition and Dimon warns of “cockroaches,” the private credit industry faces a credibility test. The question isn’t whether some loans will default—they will. It’s whether the industry’s risk management, documentation standards, and valuation practices can pass a financial stress test. “Anyone who has any amount of meaningful exposure to corporate credit markets, and in particular the leverage loan corporate credit markets, should be reexamining their portfolio in excruciating detail at this moment and really thinking hard about the quality of the underwriting that has gone into making those loans and the veracity of the reporting that supports their understanding of the performance of the business,” Milgram said. For now, the analysts who track private credit most closely see warning signs, not apocalypse. But in a market where definitional confusion obscures risk and competitive tensions drive narratives, distinguishing signal from noise is increasingly critical and difficult. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: BlackRock brings Bitcoin ETP to UK as regulator opens door for crypto products
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/blackrock-brings-bitcoin-etp-to-uk-as-regulator-opens-door-for-crypto-products/
Time Published: 2025-10-20T13:52:32Z
Full Content:
The investment giant BlackRock has launched its first bitcoin-linked exchange-traded product (ETP) in the United Kingdom, signalling a major step in bridging traditional finance with the crypto sector. The move follows the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) decision to ease restrictions on crypto investment vehicles, allowing investors to gain exposure to bitcoin without directly holding it. The launch not only widens access to digital assets for UK investors but also highlights a growing convergence between global asset managers and regulators in adapting to the evolution of financial markets. The iShares Bitcoin ETP, now listed on the London Stock Exchange, is designed to mirror the price of bitcoin and offer exposure within a regulated structure. The product allows investors to buy fractions of bitcoin through units starting at about $11, making participation in the asset class more accessible. Unlike holding bitcoin directly, investors can trade the ETP through standard brokerage accounts, bypassing the complexities of digital wallets or private key management. The product’s underlying assets are securely held by regulated custodians, ensuring compliance and oversight under the UK’s financial rules. BlackRock’s UK-listed ETP builds on the firm’s earlier success with its bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States, which has accumulated over $85 billion in net assets. It also adds to its European range, complementing listings in Switzerland, Paris, Amsterdam, and Frankfurt. The launch comes shortly after the FCA lifted its four-year ban on crypto exchange-traded notes (ETNs) on 9 October 2025. The regulator stated that UK investors could now access such products through approved exchanges, reflecting a broader acceptance of crypto-linked investment options. The decision marks a turning point for crypto regulation in the UK. It suggests a shift from outright restrictions to a more measured approach that balances investor protection with innovation. The FCA’s announcement followed months of consultation with industry players and international regulators. BlackRock’s move is expected to encourage other global asset managers to follow suit, as the UK repositions itself as a hub for financial innovation post-Brexit. The FCA’s approval has opened the door for firms such as VanEck, DWS, and WisdomTree to explore similar launches. For retail investors, the product offers exposure to bitcoin’s price movements through a traditional investment wrapper. It eliminates the need for managing crypto wallets and navigating unregulated exchanges, while allowing investment through familiar platforms. The regulator’s decision also aligns with the UK Treasury’s ambition to make the country a global centre for digital assets. It supports ongoing efforts to integrate blockchain into traditional finance, paving the way for tokenised funds and blockchain-based asset management in the future. Despite the easing of rules, the FCA maintained that its ban on crypto derivatives for retail investors will remain. While the ETP operates under a regulated structure, exposure to Bitcoin still carries the same volatility and market risks associated with the underlying asset. In parallel, the UK is exploring broader blockchain adoption across financial services. On 14 October 2025, the FCA announced new provisions allowing asset managers to use distributed ledger technology for fund tokenisation. The move is intended to foster innovation and efficiency, signalling that the regulator sees long-term potential in blockchain applications beyond cryptocurrencies. By facilitating regulated access to bitcoin and promoting tokenisation, the UK is gradually laying the groundwork for a digital financial ecosystem where traditional and decentralised finance coexist. BlackRock’s ETP marks a key milestone in this transition, setting the stage for more institutional crypto products in one of the world’s leading financial markets.

The iShares Bitcoin ETP began trading on the London Stock Exchange on Monday, with securities physically backed by Bitcoin held through Coinbase, as per the Financial Times report. "As the UK crypto investor base is projected to approach 4 million over the next year, today's listing of exchange-traded products like iShares Bitcoin ETP unlock a securer gateway to digital assets through traditional investment platforms,” the firm's EMEA head of global product Jane Sloan said, speaking to the FT. "Built on institutional-grade infrastructure, [the product] enables UK investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin with the confidence of robust custody and regulatory oversight," Sloan added. The product features institutional-grade security protocols, with Coinbase transferring Bitcoin from trading wallets into segregated, offline cold storage by day's end. The UK launch follows the runaway success of BlackRock's U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF, which became the firm's most profitable fund just 21 months after launch, now managing over $87.5 billion in assets. The fund was on track to hit $100 billion in assets under management and become the youngest ETF to cross that milestone, but last week's market crash derailed the timeline. “The launch signals the advancing institutional acceptance of Bitcoin as an investable asset class by both major regulators and global asset managers,” Fabian Dori, Chief Investment Officer at Sygnum, told Decrypt. Dori expects the UK launch to pave the way for broader crypto product offerings, noting that "in the U.S., additional ETPs beyond BTC/ETH and the first diversified crypto baskets are progressing through preparatory stages.” “At the same time, various traditional managers are expanding their digital-asset footprint, including tokenized securities in BlackRock’s case,” he added. He said it's reasonable to expect the Financial Conduct Authority to "proceed deliberately" by monitoring market conduct and retail outcomes before "broadening issuer participation" and considering additional crypto assets "in close alignment with other major financial centres." The launch also follows CEO Larry Fink's pivot on crypto, from describing Bitcoin as an "index of money laundering” in 2017 to placing crypto alongside gold in investors’ portfolios. “The markets teach you, you always have to relook at your assumptions,” Fink told CBS last week. “There is a role for crypto in the same way there is a role for gold, that is, it's an alternative." However, market conditions remain choppy with digital asset investment products seeing $513 million in outflows last week following a Binance liquidity cascade on October 10 that triggered nearly $20 billion in liquidations, including roughly $16.7 billion in long positions, according to a CoinShares report. BlackRock's UK expansion comes amid broader concerns about regulatory fragmentation in the crypto sector. Last week, the Financial Stability Board warned that crypto firms are exploiting loopholes in fragmented global regulations, threatening financial stability as countries adopt wildly different approaches to policing the digital asset market.

Title: How a Cyber Charter Struck Back When It Was Fired by a School District in New Mexico
URL: https://dianeravitch.net/2025/10/20/how-a-cybercharter-struck-back-when-it-was-fired-by-a-school-district-in-new-mexico/
Time Published: 2025-10-20T13:00:00Z
Full Content:
Peter Greene, the best education blogger ever, writes regularly for Forbes magazine. Hopefully, some of the nation’s business executives are learning about the for-profit entrepreneurs who have entered into the education “industry,”where they are profiting without doing much for students. Greene recently wrote about the latest setback for the giant of the cybercharter industry. It’s now called Stride, but for many years it was K12 Inc. Top executives are paid millions of dollars. Profit, not learning, is its highest priority. Despite terrible academic results, low graduation rates, complaints about inflated enrollments, there are always school districts happy to host the cybercharter industry because the district gets a cut of the profits. Greene writes: Stride, a giant in the cyber charter school industry, was accused by a New Mexico school district of violating rules and regulations. Now a lawsuit alleges that Stride responded by mounting a coordinated attack on the district and its superintendent. In 2020, Gallup-McKinley County Schools contracted with Stride (formerly known as K12 Inc) to operate its New Mexico Destinations Career Academy. But the district alleges that the for-profit organization repeatedly cut corners, violated staffing rules, and inflated enrollment numbers. In May 2025, the school board voted to end the contract. “Our students deserve better,” said School Board President Christopher Mortensen in a press release.“This action is not sudden; it is the result of months of effort to address persistent issues with the contractor. We are taking this step to protect our students, uphold academic standards, and meet our obligations under state and federal law.” Within months, the district had filed a complaint against Stride, charging them with fraud, unfair trade practices, civil conspiracy, and seven other counts. That lawsuit outlines the issues between Stride and the district. According to the complaint, Stride had continuing issues with meeting requirements for student-teacher ratios, having been notified as early as September 2023 that it was out of compliance. Special education teachers were over their permitted caseloads, and IEP students were not receiving their due process. Further, Stride failed to employ certified teachers, complete background checks, or provide state-mandated occupational and professional trainings to their staff. The district also alleges that Stride “retained nonexistent students on its rolls” and took school district funds for educating these ghost students. Stride failed to provide timely required communication with the district. Stride’s graduation rate, says the district, was “horrific,” with a graduation rate of 27.67% in 2024. The district also claims that through it all, Stride has “ignored compliance requirements” and failed to produce a remediation plan. According to the suit filed by the district, a management representative of Stride came forward in May as a whistleblower, declaring that the increases in student-teacher ratios was “intentional… in order to increase profit margins.” The whistleblower reported that he made multiple attempts to inform upper management that Stride was out of compliance with state law, and asked for authority to hire the roughly 80 teachers needed. The Vice President of Finance, says the whistleblower, refused to authorize those hires. Instead, in a later meeting, the whistleblower was allegedly told that his “projected profit margin was too low.” He was directed to cut staff for the next year to meet projected profit margin.” According to the whistleblower, Stride’s plans to deal with their troubles were not focused on meeting their obligations to the district. Instead, the whistleblower says, at an April meeting Stride’s Senior Vice President of School Development “Peter Stewart said the company should attack first publicly and Stride Inc. should develop a strategy for that” and that Stride CEO “James Rhyu said [to the group] that the Superintendent [for the School District] was in over his skis on this issue.” Alleges the district’s suit, ”Stride’s management, including the individual Defendants, engaged in and agreed to a civil conspiracy to cover up its misconduct and illegal activities acting, by and through its employees, agents and attorneys, in planning and engaging in a systemic public attack on the School District and its Superintendent of Schools to distract from its illegal activities and its breach of the contract with the Board of Education.” And counter-attack they did. On April 22, the district sent Stride a letter charging it had “materially breached” its contract. On April 28, the company filed an ethics complaint against GMCS Superintendent Michael Hyatt, alleging that he had tried to leverage Stride’s contract with the district in order to secure a “lucrative position” with Stride. Hyatt had applied for a management position with Stride in 2024; the company declined to hire him. The list of complaints by the district against Stride is long, but the theme is simple enough. Defendant Stride purposely and willfully disregarded the contractual requirements and the statutory and regulatory requirements in order to defraud the School District to increase its profits… Defendant Stride, while obligated to provide a certain quality of education to students, disregarded its legal obligations with the sole intent to profit on the education of students that it was supposed to educate, and that profit was obtained illegally through the intentional 27 violations of State law, incomplete and false reporting of student data, withholding technical support and operating and manipulating student counts to include students who had been dropped, withdrawn or were excessively absent. Asked for comment on the suit, a Stride representative directed me to the company’s suit-related web site which argues that the company has been working on an improvement plan, that their student-to-staff ratios are better than those reported by the district, and that “explosive growth” of NMDCA makes it hard to stay caught up with staffing. A reply to the district’s Aprill 22 letter contests virtually every point that the district has made about Stride’s performance. Since being cut loose from GMCS, Stride has re-opened NMDCA as a cyber charter school partnered with Charna Valley Independent Schools and Santa Rosa Consolidated Schools; a fact sheet from Stride says 3,000 students are enrolled, including 2,300 returning families. Those families, they say, are largely satisfied with the school. They also point out that many students enter the school short of credits, and that the majority of students are closing that gap. The Stride representative also sent a fact sheet alleging that GMCS is facing other legal problems. But Stride is no stranger to legal issues. It was founded in 2000 as K12 Inc by Ron Packard, former banker and Mckinsey consultant, and quickly became the leading national company for cyber schooling. One of its first big investors was Michal Milken. That investment came a decade after he pled guilty to six felonies in the “biggest fraud case in the securities industry” ending his reign as the “junk bond king.” Besides Milliken, Stride investors have included brothers Lowell and Larry Ellison, and BlackRock, founded by Larry Fink, whose brother Steve sits on the Stride Board of Directors. In 2011, the New York Times detailed how K12’s schools were failing miserably, but still making investors and officers a ton of money. Former teachers wrote tell-alls about their experiences. In 2012. Florida caught K12 using fake teachers. The NCAA put K12 schools on the list of cyber schools that were disqualified from sports eligibility. In 2014, Packard turned out to be one of the highest paid public workers in the country, “despite the fact that only 28% of K12 schools met state standards in 2011-2012.” In 2013 K12 settled a class action lawsuit in Virginia for $6.75 million after stockholders accused the company of misleading them about “the company’s business practices and academic performance.” In 2014, Middlebury College faculty voted to end a partnership with K12 saying the company’s business practices “are at odds with the integrity, reputation and educational mission of the college.” In 2016 K12 got in yet another round of trouble in California for lying about student enrollment, resulting in a $165 million settlement with then Attorney General Kamala Harris. K12 was repeatedly dropped in some states and cities for poor performance. In 2020, they landed a big contract in Miami-Dade county (after a big lucrative contribution to an organization run by the superintendent); subsequently Wired magazine wrote a story about their “epic series of tech errors.” K12 successfully defended itself from a lawsuit in Virginia based on charges they had greatly overstated their technological capabilities by arguing that such claims were simply advertising “puffery.” The district is seeking compensatory and punitive damages from Stride. Four Stride executives are named in the suit in addition to Stride Inc itself. The court will decide who’s blowing smoke here. In the meantime, school districts continue to learn about the price of teaming up with aggressively for-profit partners. Wow, what a story! Looks like K12 Inc [now “Stride”] may finally be brought down [& hopefully snuffed out], after 26 yrs of ripping off the public with devious/ scurrilous practices.

Strategy (MSTR), the largest publicly traded corporate holder of bitcoin, purchased 168 BTC at an average price of $112,051, according to a filing on Monday. The company financed the acquisition by raising $18.8 million through the issuance of various perpetual preferred shares and common stock. This latest purchase brings MSTR’s total bitcoin holdings to 640,418 BTC ($71 billion), with an overall average acquisition price of around $74,010. BTC climbed to over $115,000 on Oct. 13 but fell as low as $103,500 on Oct. 17. Bitcoin’s has seen a recent rebound to $111,000 on Monday, helping MSTR shares to a 3% gain in pre-market trading, just below $300 per share. However, the stock remains negative on a year-to-date basis, compared to bitcoin's 19% gain. The MSTR/BlackRock iShares Trust (IBIT) ratio currently stands at 4.74, its lowest level since October 2024. This highlights how the IBIT ETF has outperformed MSTR over the past 12 months, as the ratio previously hit an all-time high of 8.0 in November 2024.

You won't want to start your day without it. By Francisco Rodrigues (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Bitcoin BTC$108,048.05 and the broader crypto market recovered over the weekend, offering a brief reprieve after sticky selling pressure kept cryptocurrency prices depressed in the aftermath of a $500 billion value-destruction event. The price of bitcoin rose 3% in the past 24 hours to $110,770. It remains down about 4% for the month. The recovery came as global risk sentiment improves, with equities rising and investors rotating back into more volatile assets. U.S. President Donald Trump’s softer stance on tariffs and signs that the Federal Reserve may ease monetary policy later this year have helped calm markets. The CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index rose 4.3% in the past 24 hours with all members in the green. “While bitcoin has seen a notable short-term correction, the long-term trend remains a different story, as the cryptocurrency’s trajectory is still heavily influenced by macroeconomic factors such as the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy, U.S. dollar strength, spot bitcoin ETF flows, and geopolitical risks,” XS.com markets analyst Linh Tran told CoinDesk in an emailed statement. Still, short-term momentum may not signal a lasting trend. Analysts at Coinbase Institutional warned that thin liquidity, a strong U.S. dollar and uncertainty around the Federal Reserve's rate path continue to weigh on market structure. A spike in U.S. Treasury yields at the end of last week and geopolitical tensions with Israel conducting retaliatory airstrikes in Gaza after attacks on its forces while a ceasefire was in effect and as Russia advances in Ukraine, have kept many institutional investors cautious. Nevertheless corporate accumulation has kept on going, with BitcoinTreasuries data showing that in the past 30 days these entities increased their holdings by 8.4% to 4.04 million BTC. Access to crypto exposure is also growing, with BlackRock and 21Shares adding debuting their crypto ETPs on the London Stock Exchange for retail investors. “Overall, in my view, bitcoin is currently in a reaccumulation phase following its short-term correction, with market sentiment stabilizing and institutional demand remaining resilient,” Tran added.

Title: BlackRock’s Tokenized ETFs Are Only The Beginning, CEO Says

Time Published: 2025-10-20T10:10:00Z

Tokenized securities are moving closer to a reality as issuers make plans to bring more assets and funds on-chain. Lilly Riddle lilly@thedailyupside.com Tokenization was once just a whisper in the wind. Now, it’s a scream. Investment giant BlackRock, which boasts more than $13 trillion in assets under management, has made tokenized ETFs a top priority, CEO Larry Fink confirmed on an earnings call last week. Fink, who said that the crypto industry is set to grow “rapidly,” is calling for more regulatory clarity as his firm builds up the technology required to tokenize both its ETFs and traditional securities. The move is the latest by one of the industry’s largest issuers to merge the worlds of traditional and decentralized finance and bring tokenization — and with it, instantaneous transactions — to the mainstream. The hurdle for issuers remains a lack of guidance, experts said. “The challenge with all the various tokenization projects to get ETFs or stocks on the blockchain is that we don’t actually have a legal structure to allow this,” said Dave Nadig, director of research at ETF.com. “What there aren’t right now are clean legal and regulatory rails for this kind of activity … I’m not holding my breath.” While BlackRock’s move to tokenize ETFs would be a significant step toward decentralized finance, issuers are still some distance away from fully on-chain securities, said Aaron Kaplan, founder and co-CEO of Prometheum. Although having digital representations of ETFs can speed up the transaction process, it still wouldn’t allow for immediate movement of the underlying stocks, which remain off-chain. Another roadblock is the lack of infrastructure and cybersecurity safeguards, Kaplan added, particularly if on-chain assets are going to be held digitally by a custodian. “You have to have the cybersecurity, the blockchain technology, the operational security — everything else that’s required in order to protect the keys,” Kaplan said. “Because in the event that the actual custodian gets hacked, they could take those [on-chain] assets and make them disappear.” Still, Kaplan predicts tokenized on-chain assets, which now account for more than $30 billion, will soon be sold in public markets, particularly as agencies continue signaling their support. Issuers’ concerns about receiving a regulatory letter if they tried using blockchain have dissipated since the Trump administration came into office, he added. “When it comes to securities, you have to have the proper licenses and the technology to conduct such activities,” he said. “[This is] as opposed to the cryptocurrency space, which has been a little bit more Wild West-y.” Just Around the Corner. Really. As the ETF industry enters a transitional period, with markets moving from electronic to digital transactions, Kaplan anticipates that expanding on-chain trades beyond crypto products is coming — probably in the fourth quarter of 2025 or early 2026. “Initial use cases will be ETFs of bundles of underlying cryptocurrencies,” Kaplan said. “As more assets move on-chain, you’ll be able to create additional ETF products and other structured products and the like … It just makes paramount sense.” Even with the lights out at the SEC, it’s unlikely that ETF issuers seeking 3x and 5x funds will sail through the approval process. The new VanEck TruSector ETFs invest in stocks and other ETFs to maximize exposure to individual companies and reflect actual market caps. No one knows the future, but high inflation could make some investments virtually worthless. As regulators have warmed up to crypto and assets have poured into ETFs, advisors who ignore the trend risk losing clients, proponents said. Analysts from JPMorgan on Monday wrote that levered ETFs might worsen macro swings by increasing intraday volatility. The firm has waited until now to expand its US product line as sales trends are favoring ETFs over many mutual funds. As the iShares Bitcoin Trust nears the milestone, dozens of spot-price crypto ETFs are being prepped to come to market. Low-fee products tracking indexes have outperformed their higher-fee ETF counterparts and have raked in assets. The meme stock category isn’t about stonks and tendies anymore, and the new iteration focuses on broader retail sentiment. Investors have been piling into gold ETFs amid uncertainty exacerbated by the government shutdown and the dollar’s declining status. A slew of 3x leveraged single-stock ETF filings highlights issuer appetite for increasingly risky strategies. Categories outside of the US are seeing double the returns of the S&P 500, despite high tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. © 2025 The Daily Upside

BlackRock debuted a bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP) on the London Stock Exchange on Monday, one of a number of similar offerings that started trading after the Financial Conduct Authority ended a ban on retail investment imposed in 2021. In addition to the iShares Bitcoin ETP trading under the ticker IB1T, investors also gained access to products from companies including 21Shares, WisdomTree and Bitwise, which allow retail investors to buy exposure to bitcoin through a regulated market without needing to hold the cryptocurrency directly. BlackRock's product is already available elsewhere in Europe, having been listed on Xetra, Euronext Amsterdam and Euronext Paris in late March according to the BlackRock’s page for the product. Switzerland-based 21Shares introduced four of its flagship crypto ETNs. These include its bitcoin (ABTC) and ether (AETH) staking products, as well as two lower-fee "Core” offerings, CBTC and ETHC, with management fees of 0.10%. “Today’s launch represents a landmark step for the U.K. market and for everyday investors who, for years, have been excluded from regulated crypto products,” 21Shares CEO Russel Barlow said in an emailed press release. Ending the ban “begins to level the playing field with Europe.” The WisdomTree Physical Bitcoin and WisdomTree Physical Ethereum ETPs, which were previously available only to wealthy investors, are expected to be available through a range of U.K.-regulated investment platforms starting this week, the company said. Bitwise listed four ETPs on the LSE, two each tracking BTC and ETH. The firm said on Monday it was reducing the management fee of its Core Bitcoin ETP (BTC1) from 20 basis points to 5 bps for the next six months. BlackRock, which manages over $13 trillion in assets globally, has seen strong growth in its crypto-focused products. Its flagship bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), has $85.5 billion in net assets according to SoSoValue data. This makes it the largest spot bitcoin ETF, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC, which has $21.9 billion in net assets.

Title: Ethereum Foundation Researcher’s Pivot Highlights Growing Cultural Divide in Crypto

reading time 3 minutes On Friday, Ethereum Foundation Researcher Dankrad Feist announced he will be joining the stablecoin-focused blockchain startup Tempo, which was incubated via a partnership between fintech giant Stripe and crypto investment firm Paradigm. In response, some of the crypto purists on social media, most notably and understandably those who build on Ethereum, shared their disappointment, while others simply saw it as a sign of the times in terms of where the industry is headed more generally. Dankrad leaving Ethereum is a terrible look for open-source vs. corporate blockchains. Huge L for the entire community tbh — Andy (@ayyyeandy) October 17, 2025 The reaction to this recent move by Feist is an illustration of the greater cultural divide that has been growing in crypto over the past few years as more of this technology is built around increasingly centralized vectors of control. While Satoshi Nakamotoâs original Bitcoin whitepaper and other early writings discussed the need for a new system built on âcryptographic proof instead of trustâ and the problems with traditional systems being related to âall the trust thatâs required to make it work,â much of the more recent activity in crypto has involved centrally-issued stablecoins as poker chips in a meme coin casino. Much of the growth around crypto networks like Ethereum has been centered around centralized stablecoins, which operated in somewhat of a legal grey area in the U.S. prior to the passage of the GENIUS Act earlier this year. With greater regulatory clarity established around these digital dollars, there has been an increase in various developments around so-called âstablechains,â which are focused on these bank-backed dollar tokens rather than crypto-native, permissionless assets. A fundamental problem with ETH valuation is that ethereum's primary uses cases are largely external to ETH's market value. Ethereum can be very useful, its apps can garner great revenue, and ETH can still be low price — or vice versa — there is little link between them. OTOH,â¦ — Nick Szabo (@NickSzabo4) October 7, 2025 Circle and Tether are the two largest stablecoin issuers via their respective USDC and USDT tokens. Earlier this year, Circle announced the creation of their own layer-one blockchain called Arc. Additionally, Tether and its affiliates have supported the development of at least two blockchains where USDT is the native gas token, namely Stable and Plasma. More well-known players in the fintech industry are also getting involved, with Coinbase, Stripe (Tempo), PayPal, and Robinhood all either announcing or already having launched their own blockchain platforms or other expansions into the crypto market. Google Cloud and Cloudflare also have their own blockchain offerings at different stages of development that are focused on payments for artificial intelligence agents. Some of these platforms are being built as secondary layers on top of Ethereum, while others are completely separate blockchain networks. As big tech giants and other notable players get involved in building out their own blockchain networks where they can have more control and extract more value, the cypherpunk values Satoshi wanted to infuse into Bitcoin, such as privacy and censorship resistance, have struggled to gain the hearts and minds of the general public. Sure, the bitcoin price recently hit a new all-time high once again (before subsequently dropping more than 15%); however, much of the recent bull run has been built around centralized, regulated financial products such as the publicly-traded exchange-traded funds (ETFs) from the likes of BlackRock and bitcoin treasury companies such as Strategy. There are still pockets of activity in crypto that are relatively faithful to the Satoshi vision. Not all use cases reintroduce trusted third parties by building everything around centralized stablecoins or throw away privacy by putting too much financial data on public blockchains. This is becoming an increasingly smaller percentage of overall activity, however, when compared to speculation on dubious token offerings or further empowering financial institutions with new technology that allows them to avoid strict anti-money laundering regulations as long as they put their customers on a database they call a blockchain. Bitcoin itself has remained somewhat resistant to corporate influence at the protocol level, as shown by the resolution of its internal block size warÂ back in 2017. However, Ethereumâs reliance on stablecoins is becoming an increasingly hard-to-ignore issue that is worth watching, as the issuers of these tokens have an incentive to use their centralized point of control to extract as much value as possible from this technology. As seen by the recent âstablechainâ phenomenon, this may include a desire to cut the open Ethereum network out of the picture entirely. Contrastly, Bitcoinâs main problematic point of centralization in terms of third-party custodians still requires those custodians to use the Bitcoin network. While people are still able to use these technologies in the permissionless, non-custodial manner Satoshi originally intended, the crypto industry as a whole is increasingly turning into a way for centralized financial entities to empower themselves rather than individual users.

Title: $600 Billion Could Flow Into Crypto From Wall Street: Galaxy Research
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/600-billion-inflow-crypto-wall-street-galaxy/
Time Published: 2025-10-20T09:00:10Z
Full Content:
Galaxy Research’s latest brief argues that the “wealth channel” in the United States—the network of roughly 300,000 financial advisors overseeing about $30 trillion in client assets—is finally starting to open to crypto assets, with implications that are both mechanical and potentially transformative. The crux of the thesis is arithmetic but not trivial: “If even a modest 2% allocation to bitcoin ETFs emerged across this channel, that would translate to roughly $600 billion in potential inflows,” the note states, adding that such a sum “is comparable to the entire global gold ETF market (~$472 billion) and more than 3x the US spot bitcoin ETF AUM (~$146 billion).” The firm frames this as the moment crypto begins moving from retail-driven speculation toward advisor-led portfolio construction, as approvals, custody, and compliance guardrails converge inside the largest wirehouses and banks. The catalyst, in Galaxy’s telling, is a series of platform-level access changes and infrastructure buildouts that remove long-standing bottlenecks. On October 10, Morgan Stanley “removed longstanding restrictions on crypto fund access for its financial advisors,” allowing proactive recommendations “to all clients across any account type.” Galaxy highlights the bank’s newest house guidance—“up to 4%” of portfolios in digital assets—as a conservative but meaningful signal that crypto is being slotted alongside established diversifiers. The shift matters less as a branding exercise and more as a workflow change: when exposure becomes standard inside advisory toolkits, it can be modeled, rebalanced, and supervised under the same risk and suitability processes that govern equities, bonds, and alternatives. The research brief stresses how the wealth channel’s internal approval machinery has been the real gating factor. Advisors “can only allocate to products formally approved by their firms,” and those approvals depend on “custody readiness, compliance frameworks, operational integration, and client suitability standards.” Crypto has lagged not because advisors lack interest, Galaxy argues, but because “approval of crypto products has been especially cautious” amid volatility, evolving regulation, and a limited on-platform track record. That calculus is changing as banks build the “critical backbone” internally—trading, custody, and advisory systems that let them “offer secure, scalable crypto access through their wealth platforms.” In the same vein, the note flags movement among the largest brand names in US asset management and banking. Vanguard—long the archetype of crypto skepticism—“is reportedly preparing to offer select third-party crypto ETFs to its brokerage clients,” a reversal Galaxy attributes to “strong client demand and a more supportive regulatory climate,” while noting that there is “not yet [a] specific timeline or which ETFs will be made available.” Citi, for its part, “plans to launch institutional-grade crypto custody in 2026,” and JPMorgan “signaled that its clients will soon be able to trade bitcoin and other crypto assets,” albeit without in-house custody for now. Galaxy treats these moves less as isolated headlines than as evidence that banks intend to capture crypto flows “using their own integrated trading, custody, and advisory systems” to provide regulated access at scale. Policy context also features in Galaxy’s analysis. The brief points to the recent executive order allowing 401(k) plans to include crypto as an option” as a legitimizing step that helps fiduciaries and compliance teams grow comfortable with the risk profile of digital assets inside retirement plans. While implementation ultimately depends on how plan sponsors interpret fiduciary obligations, Galaxy’s point is that headline regulatory posture is no longer exclusively restrictive—reducing a key narrative and operational headwind for wealth platforms. Importantly, Galaxy situates the prospective 2% allocation within a broader spectrum of public guidance from prominent allocators over the past year. The firm notes that “BlackRock, Fidelity, Bridgewater’s Ray Dalio, and Ric Edelman have publicly suggested crypto allocations ranging from a conservative 1% to as high as 40% in aggressive scenarios.” Within this range, Morgan Stanley’s “up to 4%” ceiling is neither fringe nor maximalist; it reads as a risk-budgeted sleeve for an asset class the bank now describes as “both a hedge against inflation and a long-term growth opportunity.” Galaxy extends the math: if average allocations across advised assets land closer to 1% than 2%, bitcoin ETF assets could still reach “$500 billion within a few years.” The bottom line: If advisors can finally “integrate crypto directly into traditional balanced portfolios,” the firm concludes, the industry will likely look back on this period as the point “where crypto transitions from a niche investment to a standard portfolio component, alongside equities, bonds, and gold.” At press time, the total crypto market cap was at $3.71 trillion.

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change Quote of the Week: “For my many mentors, who taught me the importance of scientific integrity.”— Steven E. Koonin, dedication in Unsettled? (2021) Number of the Week: 0.45% per year, 0.82% per year, and 1.51% per year THIS WEEK: By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP) Scope: This TWTW begins with a discussion of an effort by the UN to establish a global carbon tax. TWTW presents some responses from GROK AI to questions like why do many physicists object to quantum mechanics? TWTW discusses some weaknesses in a new paper from members of the CERES project and it discusses a report on crossing tipping points. TWTW concludes with a discussion of a paper on the world record surface temperature and a UK master food plan. ********************* Global Carbon Tax: For years, some commentators have speculated why the UN was so emphatic in creating fear of carbon dioxide, which is essential for life on Earth. In the 1850s Earth was coming out of the Little Ice Age when famine was a widespread problem in temperate regions when crops did not ripen. A bit of warming was a blessing that permitted crops to ripen. The UN ignored this history. In their efforts to create fear, the UN relied on computer models with questionable assumptions. When tested against atmospheric temperatures the models clearly fail, significantly overestimating the warming of the atmosphere, where the greenhouse effect occurs. The UN ignored this fact and many others in making questionable claims about the warming effect of carbon dioxide in today’s atmosphere. Based on decades of laboratory experiments, carbon dioxide has a slight warming effect, which is beneficial, not harmful for life on Earth. Further, thousands of studies show that adding carbon dioxide will make most plants more robust, particularly C3 plants that include virtually all food crops except C4 grasses such as corn (maize), sugarcane, sorghum, and millets. Yet even C4 plants do better in an atmosphere richer in CO2. Greenhouses and hothouses growing plants routinely double or even triple the amount of CO2 in their atmospheres to promote growth. These yield fresh vegetables year-round, even in cold climates such as in the northern parts of Europe and North America. The UN typically dismisses or ignores such benefits. The UN’s actions in creating fear of carbon dioxide prompted some commentators to speculate that the UN hopes to obtain a source of funding independent of governments that can hold it accountable by instituting a carbon tax or a regulatory authority to collect fees for emissions of carbon dioxide. Such commentators have been dismissed as cynics. This year, the UN showed they are not. In April, the UN International Maritime Organization planned to institute a Global Carbon Tax, which was to be implemented in a meeting on October 17. On October 10, the US State Department issued a joint statement by the Secretaries of State, Energy, and Transportation titled “Taking Action to Defend America from the UN’s First Global Carbon Tax – the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) “Net-Zero Framework” (NZF).” The statement asserts: “President Trump has made it clear that the United States will not accept any international environmental agreement that unduly or unfairly burdens the United States or harms the interests of the American people. Next week, members of the IMO will vote on the adoption of a so-called NZF aimed at reducing global carbon dioxide gas emissions from the international shipping sector. This will be the first time that a UN organization levies a global carbon tax on the world. The Administration unequivocally rejects this proposal before the IMO and will not tolerate any action that increases costs for our citizens, energy providers, shipping companies and their customers, or tourists. The economic impacts from this measure could be disastrous, with some estimates forecasting global shipping costs increasing as much as 10% or more. We ask you to join us in rejecting adoption of the NZF at the October meeting and to work together on our collective economic and energy security. The NZF proposal poses significant risks to the global economy and subjects not just Americans, but all IMO member states to an unsanctioned global tax regime that levies punitive and regressive financial penalties, which could be avoided. The United States is considering the following actions against nations that support this global carbon tax on American consumers: The United States will be moving to levy these remedies against nations that sponsor this European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations. We will fight hard to protect our economic interests by imposing costs on countries if they support the NZF. Our fellow IMO members should be on notice.” On October 17, at the IMO meeting in London with over 100 countries represented, Saudi Arabia moved to table the talk of a tax until next year, the motion to table carried, and the meeting was adjourned.

Those who desire to obtain differing views on a controversial subject cannot hope to do so using most internet search engines. TWTW asked Google AI: Why do many physicists object to quantum mechanics? It received a mushy answer about the so-called scientific consensus. The response was unhelpful in trying to understand why journal editors routinely reject papers written by Atomic, Molecular, and Optical (AMO) physicists based on evidence obtained by experiment or observation. Is the IPCC false “consensus” view that dominant? TWTW asked GROK AI the same question it asked Google AI. The response began with: “Many physicists don’t outright reject quantum mechanics—it’s the most successful theory in physics, underpinning technologies from semiconductors to lasers. However, a significant number object to its interpretations, particularly the standard Copenhagen interpretation, due to deep conceptual problems. Here’s why:” The response from GROK AI was far more satisfactory than from Google AI. So TWTW asked GROK AI to think harder. The response was: BEGIN QUOTE Many physicists don’t outright reject quantum mechanics—it’s the most successful theory in physics, underpinning technologies from semiconductors to lasers. However, a significant number object to its interpretations, particularly the standard Copenhagen interpretation, due to deep conceptual problems. Here’s why: 1. The Measurement Problem 2. Nonlocality and “Spooky Action at a Distance” 3. Lack of a Unified Interpretation 4. Incompleteness and the Classical-Quantum Divide 5. Philosophical and Aesthetic Discomfort Notable Critics and Alternatives Physicist/Thinker Main Objection Proposed Alternative Albert Einstein Nonlocality, incompleteness Hidden variables Edwin Schrödinger Measurement absurdity Unified field theory David Bohm Indeterminism Pilot-wave (deterministic) Gerard ‘t Hooft Observer-dependence Superdeterminism Roger Penrose No gravity integration Objective collapse Sabine Hossenfelder Philosophical vagueness Emergent QM from deeper laws Counterpoint: Why Most Physicists Accept It Bottom Line Objections stem from conceptual ugliness, not failed predictions. Quantum mechanics is like a black box: input experiment, output flawless result—but open it, and it’s philosophically messy. Many physicists (e.g., ~40% in surveys) favor alternatives like Many-Worlds or Bohmian mechanics. The debate rages because physics craves not just what works, but what is real. Ongoing work in quantum gravity (string theory, loop quantum gravity) may resolve this—or reveal even stranger truths. END QUOTE The response from GROK AI suggests an interesting dilemma for government policy makers. We have global climate models based on principles of classical physics that do not work. And we have calculations by noted physicists based on physical evidence but out of the context of classical physics and objected to by noted classical physicists. Which should be used? It may be disturbing, but because we do not have an intuitive understanding of “why it works” is no reason to not use it. ********************* CERES Cloudiness: According to NASA’s Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) mission website: “Climate is controlled by the amount of sunlight absorbed by Earth and the amount of infrared energy emitted to space. These quantities–together with their difference–define Earth’s radiation budget (ERB). The Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) project provides satellite-based observations of ERB and clouds. It uses measurements from CERES instruments flying on several satellites along with data from many other instruments to produce a comprehensive set of ERB data products for climate, weather, and applied science research. The goals of the CERES project are to: Writing in PNAS, the CERES team reports that twenty-four years of satellite observations from CERES show that the Northern Hemisphere (NH) is becoming darker while the Southern Hemisphere (SH) is becoming brighter. The abstract states, in part: “The emerging darkening of the NH relative to the SH is associated with changes in hemispheric differences in aerosol–radiation interactions, surface albedo, and water vapor changes. Cloud changes also contribute to a greater ASR [absorbed solar radiation] hemispheric contrast, but the magnitude is small due to opposing trend differences in the tropics and extratropics. The break in hemispheric symmetry in ASR challenges the notion that clouds naturally compensate for forced hemispheric asymmetries in noncloud properties. Hemispheric (a)symmetry in radiation is linked with the atmosphere–ocean general circulation. How clouds respond to this hemispheric imbalance has important implications for future climate.” The effort to understand changing cloudiness and other properties of Earth that influence climate is notable but as John Robson points out, the reasoning becomes questionable when the authors write: “To gain some insight, we use the multimodel mean climate model simulations in ref. 25 for 2001 to 2019 to examine hemispheric trends in cloud radiative effect (CRE; defined as the difference between clear and all-sky downward TOA flux) and contributions from cloud feedback, “effective radiative forcing” ERF (sum of IRF and rapid adjustments), and the associated cloud masking terms (due to variations in noncloud properties).” [Boldface added.] Why do the authors seek an explanation using “the multimodel mean climate model simulations” for explanations of the data? The models have been shown to overestimate atmospheric temperature tends, thus falsified. The purpose of the mission is to produce a data record to improve our understanding of the Earth’s radiation budget by observations and thus hope to improve global climate models. Writing for Net Zero Watch, David Whitehouse has a more generous view of this paper.

Jo Nova points out that Peter Ridd and the Reef Rebels use The Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) studies which show a significant improvement in the Great Barrier Reef in the 2020s with a slight decline in 2025. The amount of coral cover at the Reef is now higher than it was any time before 2023 since systematic data collection began in 1985. TWTW asks: How many tipping points were crossed by environmental degradation during the Eemian period, the last interglacial with the environment rebounding from thousands of feet of ice covering most of North America? Will tipping points be crossed when Earth cools again with the onset of a severe glaciation? All this is an effort to drum up support for the 2025, 30th Conference of Parties (COP) of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) which will take place in November in Belém, Brazil.

Oct 14, 2025 What you see is what you get… unfortunately By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Oct 15, 2025 We call it double nonsense because it starts with the common fatuity Thomas Sowell explores in A Conflict of Visions of believing the key to successful public policy initiatives is sufficiently strong, and sufficiently loudly proclaimed, good intentions. It is a strange thing for adults to believe about anything. It wouldn’t get you far in car repair, for instance. Or cooking. And after a few years living on your own you ought to know good intentions don’t get the dog fed, the sink cleaned or much of anything. [Canada’s Minister of Environment and Climate Change] Dabrusin’s remarks are rendered doubly and hopelessly inane by the fact that Canadian politicians, mostly in her own party, have had one thing and one thing only on the climate file for a third of a century now. And it is (drum roll please) ambition. They have not had understanding, of the science, the economics or the administration. They certainly have not had success. But over and over again they have brandished their vaulting ambition. What Climate Crisis? By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Oct 17, 2025 17-minute video featuring a proponent of clean energy claiming we need to do more and Daily Sceptic’s Chris Morrison Yes Virginia, David can slay Goliath By Ronald Stein, America Out Loud News, Oct 13, 2025 The misunderstanding of “green” delusionists is treating electricity as interchangeable with materials, as it is the central flaw of the green movement. Electricity is a utility, not a substance. In fact, steel, cement, plastics, fertilizers, and pharmaceuticals all require hydrocarbons—not simply as fuel but as essential feedstocks. Oil, natural gas, and coal are the molecular foundations for over 6,000 everyday products that define modern life. Without them, hospitals would lack sterile equipment, farmers would lose fertilizers, and the construction of roads, bridges, and homes would grind to a halt. Nonprofits Cruelly Normalize Poverty for Climate Virtue By Vijay Jayaraj, CO2 Coalition, Oct 16, 2025 Similarly, Africa today accounts for less than 5% of global oil product demand despite presenting 18% of the world’s population.” Government budgets in the U.S. and Europe have poured millions into climate initiatives purportedly aimed at “mitigation” and “resilience.” Disguised is the redirection of funds into programs meant to deny oil and natural gas development in regions that need it most. #HaveItBothWays: Plants going uphill By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Oct 15, 2025 The logic is impeccable. Cold temperature limits plant growth so as temperatures rise, the upper line where plants including trees can and do grow will travel uphill. It is even, awkwardly for climate alarmists, one of the ways we know it was warmer during the Medieval Warm Period: trees grew at higher altitudes (and latitudes). And so it was in 2002 that a group of scientists carefully and logically made the case that the optimal range of trees would start shifting uphill.

But as of the early 21st century ICAT stopped tracking the standard literature and started using the now-canceled and grossly overstated NOAA Billion Dollar Disaster data set, stitching it on to the earlier part of the series despite being constructed on a completely different basis. Putting the two different series together, a hoary statistical no-no, caused an upward trend to appear in the G18 paper where none did previously. It was that the IPCC and NCA ignored over 60 other studies reporting the absence of a disaster trend and put all their faith in one study claiming a trend exists. And then when that study was shown to be invalid, the scientific authorities refused to correct the record. We’d call that a scandal. We’d even call it a shocking scandal, except that we’ve seen it too often to be shocked anymore. And clearly many in the field who know better are not sufficiently shocked to speak up.

Abram, et al., Nature, NPJ Climate Action, Oct 13, 2025 From newspaper article: In the new paper published in the Nature journal Climate Action, researchers found Scarborough’s 880 million tonnes of emissions over its lifetime — including emissions when the gas was burnt — would increase global temperatures by 0.00039 degrees. The small increase can still have significant consequences, according to [co-author] Professor Perkins-Kirkpatrick. [Professor of Climate Science in the Fenner School of Environment and Society at Australian National University (ANU)] According to the study, another 356,000 people globally would be pushed outside the human climate niche — a comfort zone defined by scientists as the climate conditions in which human societies have historically thrived.

At the centre of this story is our favourite food. Meat production has long bothered the environmental movement and climate campaigners, because it is at the centre of culture, and family and social life. 8-minute video with lightly edited transcript and illustrations by Clutz Questioning European Green Europe in the Rare Earth Trap By Thomas Kolbe, American Thinker, Oct 16, 2025 Energy Expert Vahrenholt: Hamburg’s Zero CO2 By 2040 Is “A Fundamental Attack On Prosperity” By P Gosselin, No Tricks Zone, Oct 17, 2025 Vahrenholt is not alone. Other critics, seeing a silver lining, have pointed out that Hamburg will serve as the sacrifice city that will showcase to the rest of Germany the absurdity of mandating a carbon-free society. Clean Power For 87 Hours! By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Oct 17, 2025 From Carbon Brief: “Electricity demand on the island of Great Britain has been fully covered by the output of clean-energy sources for a record 87 hours in 2025 to date, new Carbon Brief analysis shows.” Homewood: But as Carbon Brief admit, we still had plenty of gas power running for the whole of that time, most likely to provide inertia. Although non-fossil fuel power just about covered demand, the surplus power was exported. Shut The CCC Now! By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Oct 15, 2025 The Climate Change Committee are getting desperate, as they face oblivion after the next election: Funding Issues Science Subsidy Trap: Why Public Research Funding Needs to End By Cameron English, ACSH, Apr 16, 2025 The simple fact is that private R&D spending dwarfs public investment, with as much as 70 percent of science financed by corporations and charities. In the US, the difference is similarly massive. Of the $892 billion total invested in R&D in 2023, “the business sector funded $673 billion and the federal government funded $164 billion,” the National Science Foundation reported in February. Trump finalizes $1.6B loan for power lines initiated by Biden By Rachel Frazin, The Hill, Oct 16, 2025 Litigation Issues Climate Lawfare Circus Update By Ron Clutz, Science Matters, Oct 11, 2025 Orsted vs. Trump: An offshore battle looms By David Wojick, CFACT, Oct 14, 2025 The world’s largest offshore wind developer, backed by the government of Denmark, is on a deliberate collision course with the Trump Administration. The battleground is Sunrise Wind, a 924 megawatt (MW) offshore wind project located roughly 30 miles east of Long Island’s Montauk Point. Orsted just raised almost $10 billion, two-thirds of which is reportedly aimed at building Sunrise. Sunrise has all its federal permits, but offshore construction has yet to begin, or, as the industry puts it, there is no “steel in the water.” The Trump administration has vowed to stop all offshore wind projects that are not already under construction, so Sunrise must be in the federal crosshairs. States sue Trump administration over terminated solar funding By Rachel Frazin, The Hill, Oct 17, 2025 Officials in more than 20 states and Washington, D.C., sued the federal government over a decision to axe a Biden-era program to provide solar power to disadvantaged communities. In a pair of legal filings this week, the states argued that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) move to cut the $7 billion Solar for All (SFA) program was unlawful and unconstitutional and a breach of its contract with the states. Judge dismisses young climate activists’ lawsuit challenging Trump on fossil fuels By NBC Montana Staff, Oct 15, 2025 [H/t Bernie Kepshire] Subsidies and Mandates Forever Lose It: Towards a Tax-neutral Energy Market By Robert Bradley Jr., Master Resource, Oct 15, 2025 The chart below from social media lists some of the current deadlines for major [US] energy subsidies. Renewables soar as renewables crash By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Oct 15, 2025 But despite the Panglossian gloss, that last sentence actually tells you, as does the collapse in the industry in the U.S. as the subsidy rug is yanked out from under, that these kinds of energy do not appeal to end users, just to governments who, as Margaret Thatcher pointed out long ago, sooner or later run out even of other people’s money.

But £3.455/MWh works out at a billion pounds a year, £40 for every household in the country. They claim it will lead to lower bills eventually, once Sizewell C is built. But I will believe that when I see it! All the evidence from Hinkley suggests that costs will keep escalating. UK Exporting Gas Power To Windless Europe By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Oct 14, 2025 What will happen when our gas plants are shut down? German Energy Expert Warns Of Germany’s Energy Supply Madness…Energy Security On The Line By P Gosselin, No Tricks Zone, Oct 11, 2025 Even the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) under Klaus Müller warns in its security of supply report: By 2035, up to 35,500 MW of additional controllable capacity will be needed – equivalent to about 70 gas power plants. As early as 2030, a deficit of up to 21,000 MW is expected. This gap will inevitably lead to massive power supply bottlenecks during periods of Dunkelflaute (low wind and no solar radiation). To cover up the misery, the BNetzA is planning a direct attack on energy-intensive German industry. Under the AgNES project, the so-called “Bandlastrabatt“ (base-load tariff discount) for the 560 companies in the basic materials industry (chemicals, metals, glass), which operate 24/7, is to be abolished. The justification: Industry must become the scapegoat for the failed energy policy and “flexibilize“ its production according to the wind and weather. This is simply impossible for continuous processes like copper or glass production. The cancellation of the €1.42 billion discount is of existential importance for the basic materials industry. Netherlands’ renewables drive putting pressure on its power grid By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Oct 16, 2025 Netherlands Electricity Mix By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Oct 16, 2025 As in all northerly latitudes, solar power is virtually useless in winter, while at the same time overloading the grid in summer. Wind is its usual intermittent and variable nature. As a result, in December 2024, thermal power supplied 58% of electricity, with solar a miserable 3%. Energy Issues – Australia Renewables will need subsidies until we get rid of coal says government — “Another ten years” By Jo Nova, Her Blog, Oct 15, 2025 If the green subsidies can’t end until coal power is gone, it looks more like their primary goal was not to help renewables so much as to destroy coal… Queensland breaks the unthinkable tabboo, saves $26b and keeps old coal plants running *til 2046*! By Jo Nova, Her Blog, Oct 11, 2025 If Queensland doesn’t turn into horned turnip or a snivelling hunchback, other states might get the crazy idea that they can do this too. Especially when the businesses move to Queensland… Energy Issues — US DOE Secretary Chris Wright: Energy Exceptionalism Quotations By Robert Bradley Jr., Master Resource, Oct 14, 2025 President Trump Is Fixing FERC By Daniel Turner, Real Clear Energy, Oct 15, 2025 In June 2022, The Wall Street Journal broke the story of [FERC’s chairman Richard] Glick’s biweekly meetings with the White House climate office. Suddenly, it all clicked. Team Biden wanted to advance the climate agenda and punish the fossil fuel industry, and the FERC became the vehicle to do both. The weaponization of government struck again. Former Chair Glick treated upgrades and basic maintenance as new projects, beginning the review process at square one. The Slowly Mounting Mineral Shock By Portia Roberts , Peter Bryant, Real Clear Energy, Oct 13, 2025 Oil shocks cause price leaps, lines at gas stations, political fallout. Mineral shocks are slow burns, until they’re not. They might initially surface as longer delivery times, stalled grid projects, costlier products––or some with missing features. But if mineral shortages continue, if (limited) stockpiles are exhausted, markets unavoidably face price shocks. NYISO Weighs In On The New York State Draft Energy Plan By Francis Menton, Manhattan Contrarian, Cot 14, 2025 Link to: Comments of the New York Independent System Operator on the Draft State Energy Plan By Staff, NYISO, Oct 6, 2025 From Menton: I then submitted my own Comment on the Plan, and had a further post describing that on September 27. Key takeaway: “[T]he so-called ‘Energy Plan’ is not an energy plan at all. It would more accurately be described as random musings and wishful thinking by some completely incompetent people who have no idea what they are doing.” So, with that background, let’s take a look at NYISO’s newly-issued Comment. This sentence from page 1 is fairly representative of the overall tone: “The NYISO submits these comments to highlight electric system reliability concerns and to offer approaches that support ongoing electric system reliability through competitive markets for consideration as part of the final State Energy Plan. “ They are submitting comments to “highlight . . . concerns.” Yes, I guess so, but I find that a wholly inadequate statement of the problem. In fact, the energy bureaucracies are driving the State down an impossible path from which it becomes increasingly difficult to exit before disaster strikes. Critics Fear Financial Titans Have Found Trojan Horse For ‘Climate Mandates’ By Audrey Streb, Daily Caller, Oct 13, 2025 AI Needs Data Centers—and People to Build Them How did the world of bits and bytes become the second-largest source of demand for construction workers, trailing only residential housing?

America’s Energy Dilemma: A Consumer’s Guide to Common Sense By Terry L. Headley, Real Clear Energy, Oct 14, 2025 When judged by the same standards every American uses to make a purchase—cost, reliability, security, longevity, and value—coal remains the only logical choice. Nuclear Energy and Fears And Now, SMR Intelligence Global Last month, we published an in-depth guide to the US companies vying to deploy small modular reactors.

Yes, a slew of US companies are working on designs and prototypes, but they are years behind their Russian and Chinese counterparts. Who’s winning the SMR race? By Stephen McBride and Dan Steinhart, Rational Optimist Society, Oct 12, 2025 Connecting nuclear reactors across Africa By Kelvin Kemm, WUWT, Oct 16, 2025 So African countries should now clearly adopt nuclear power as their future. They owe it to their citizens to provide a clear vision of a stable, reliable, and inexpensive electricity supply as a foundation for national growth.

By Eric Worrall, WUWT, Oct 12, 2025 I believe former environmentalist tech leaders are driving this uptick in confidence, because they are clinging to irrational hopes for an imminent fusion breakthrough like a shipwrecked sailor clings to a life raft. The alternative to belief in the imminence of nuclear fusion is to accept they are utter hypocrites, that Big Tech’s AI push is a total betrayal of their once precious green energy ideals. New York to appeal after judge OKs radioactive Indian Point water in the Hudson By Johan Sheridan, The Hill, Oct 14, 2025 The wastewater in question is contaminated with tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen created during the nuclear fission process. Tritium—whose half-life is 12 years—bonds with oxygen, meaning the wastewater cannot be filtered. Regulations on radioactive releases from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the federal body managing decommissions, are based on the dose to the public, regardless of the volume of the discharge. NRC has an internal goal to keep the dose from liquid releases below three millirem per year at the release point, and a legal limit of 25 millirem per year. The calculated dose to the public from Indian Point in 2021 was about 0.011966 millirem—about one-thousandth of the federal cap. [SEPP Comment: Tritium or hydrogen3 (3H) is extremely rare. It is produced naturally by the interaction of atmospheric gases with cosmic rays.] Amazon Unveils ‘Cascade’—Energy Northwest’s Xe-100 SMR Project, Targeting Construction by 2030 By Sonal Patel, Power Mag, Oct 15,2025 Amazon’s Climate Pledge, which aims to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040, unites more than 550 signatories across 55 industries to accelerate joint action on climate solutions. Its Climate Pledge Fund—a $2 billion venture investment program—supports technologies that advance sustainability and carbon-free energy, including investments in wind, solar, battery storage, and new SMR projects to power its operations and add clean generation to the grid. The Northwest Power and Conservation Council’s 2025 demand forecast shows steep potential growth in regional electricity use through 2046, driven primarily by data centers and semiconductor facilities, followed by electrified transportation and emerging hydrogen production. Alternative, Green (“Clean”) Solar and Wind Texans Should Stop Spending on Fake Climate Crisis By Gregory Wrightstone, CO2 Coalition, Oct 17, 2025 Boasting that Texas “has built more wind power than any state and is a top contender for the most solar power,” a Texas Tribune article bemoans a decline in federal subsidies for such energy sources and a potential loss of “billions in investments and thousands of jobs.” Avian Mortality: Industrial Wind in Ecological Trouble By Sherri Lange, Master Resource, Oct 16, 2025 The U.S. Secretary of the Interior, Doug Burgum, posted a memorandum back in August calling on the agency to ensure compliance with the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, “to ensure that our national bird is not sacrificed for unreliable wind facilities!” A US startup plans to deliver ‘sunlight on demand’ after dark.

Death of a ‘Clean Energy’ Debacle A new ‘endangerment’ study shows that the climate battle is over except for the lawfare. By Holman W. Jenkins, Jr., WSJ, Oct. 14, 2025 The columnist begins with: “Oh, the humanity, I sarcastically thought on reading the names and affiliations of 39 scientists behind a National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine finding that, as the New York Times put it, ‘greenhouse gases are, in fact, a danger.’ Read on and realize their book-length report is concocted for a bureaucratic and legalistic purpose, not a scientific one. It will disappear into the maw of a futile partisan legal squabble over the Trump administration’s effort to repeal the 2009 so-called endangerment finding by the Environmental Protection Agency. This finding, in the Obama years, would be used to justify regulatory actions that have zero impact—none—on climate change. Not only are U.S. emissions too small a share of the global total to matter; in practice, EPA actions mostly just drive U.S. emissions offshore. Whatever they think, the 39 scientists are part of a machine now defending its own activity and privilege, in one of the biggest boondoggles in the history of policy making. Remember the left-wing film director Michael Moore’s 2019 opus ‘Planet of the Humans’? Of course you don’t. It was shadow-banned by the left and film distributors not because it was short on climate apocalyptics—it was over-the-top on climate apocalyptics. It was shadow-banned for pointing out that U.S. climate policy was a fraud. It consisted of colossal pork barrel that was having no effect on the alleged problem. Richard York, of the University of Oregon, is seen marveling in the film at the self-willed blindness of the U.S. policy community to a simple question: Do clean-energy subsidies result in fossil fuels being displaced? ‘They don’t even know that that’s a question,’ he says in a voice of wonder. As often happens, truth tellers weren’t really in short supply. As often happens too, we can pinpoint the exact moment and exact dynamics when a policy boondoggle was born. President Obama was taking office amid the 2008-09 financial crisis. Money printing was popular; new energy taxes weren’t. So he abandoned his party’s long-standing advocacy of a carbon tax in favor of turning green energy into just another thing government money printing could support. Put it this way: Hot dog consumption would surely rise if hot dogs were subsidized by government. Purely a conceit, though, is any idea that cheeseburger consumption would simultaneously decline. It doesn’t follow. And so it has proved: Energy consumption has simply grown overall. It’s almost too big a question. Why, under the First Amendment and the special protections it enjoys, does our press still fail us? If the press has any job, it’s policy analysis—to tell us whether government actions are producing their stated aims or devolving into pocket lining by special interests, in this case amounting to trillions of dollars in the U.S. and around the world. Last year a study put paid to magical thinking. Of 1,500 climate policies adopted in 41 countries over two decades, less than 5% have resulted in any reduction of emissions. Donald Trump has been good for one thing, showing millions of Americans why they should feel contempt for their media and leadership elites. But he has mostly succeeded at beating these elites at their own game of electoral politics, not changing the game. This week’s partial Hamas defeat may prove a game changer. His productive disabling of the green energy elite may be a longer-lasting game changer.” The columnist compares some politicians, then concludes with: “This doesn’t mean we should welcome growing CO2. But if you’re not trying to get at the truth, you’re doing something else. ‘Negative impacts might be more severe in the absence of efforts to adapt,’ the report is reduced to nonsensically arguing, as if adaptation is not the definition of being alive for humans and other creatures. Two lessons are worth drawing from this whole sorry episode: Beings who think themselves independent and science-minded are not immune to the reward system in which they operate. The bigger lesson concerns how democracy’s error-correction function can be impeded when an unnatural uniformity prevails among elites. This has clearly been the case during the 16 years and approximately 350 days of the green energy fraud.” ***************** Subscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.

Title: One in Four charity sees more men than women come forward for first time
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/2025/10/20/one-in-four-charity-sees-more-men-than-women-come-forward-for-first-time/
Time Published: 2025-10-20T05:00:01Z
Full Content:
The One in Four charity, which supports survivors of child sex abuse, saw more men than women come forward last year, for the first time in its more than 20-year history. In what was also its busiest year, the proportion of male survivors reached a “historic high” – a development the charity puts down to the aftermath of the Blackrock Boys radio documentary, which detailed historic sexual abuse of two brothers, Mark and David Ryan, at Blackrock College in south Co Dublin. It led to the establishment of a scoping inquiry into abuse in religious-run schools and, this year, a commission of investigation. Its work is ongoing. The charity’s 2024 annual report, published on Monday, notes the 14 per cent increase in the proportion of male survivors – from 48 per cent of all contacts in 2023 to 62 per cent – and that this increase coincided with the Government’s publication of the Scoping Inquiry Report into Historical Sexual Abuse in Schools. “Contacts to the service increased by 17 per cent, with 7,674 support sessions delivered to 1,292 individuals. Advocacy support requests rose by 21 per cent,” says the report. “The percentage of male survivors coming forward reached a historic high, climbing to 62 per cent from 48 per cent [in 2023].” One in Four chief executive Deirdre Kenny said the trend indicated that when the State “talks honestly about child sexual abuse and demonstrates that survivors will be heard, people respond. “The public conversation and the visibility of the scoping inquiry have helped create an environment in which survivors – especially men – felt able to come forward and seek support.” In all, the charity delivered almost 8,000 sessions of support to 1,292 people. Nearly half (44 per cent) were living in Dublin, with 45 per cent in the rest of Ireland and the remaining abroad or unknown. More than half were men (62 per cent), with 37 per cent women and 1 per cent non-binary. “These numbers represent not just statistics, but real people breaking years, sometimes decades, of silence,” said Ms Kenny. In July last year, the Government published the report of the scoping inquiry into historical sexual abuse in schools run by religious orders. Its primary recommendation, that a commission of investigation be established, was accepted by the Government. It appointed Mr Justice Michael MacGrath to chair the commission which will examine the handling of allegations, suspicions and concerns of historical sexual abuse all primary and post-primary schools. Ms Kenny said the commission would “play a crucial role in examining decades of child sexual abuse in schools and uncovering the lessons of our past”.

Japan’s crypto adoption exploded 120% in 2025 amid positive policy shift. The interest in digital assets has grown, especially in Japan. Per Chainalysis, Japan topped the 2025 adoption list with a 120% crypto user growth. Japan may be gearing up for a major overhaul to drive crypto adoption. The country’s regulator, the Financial Services Agency (FSA), is considering allowing banks to hold crypto assets like Bitcoin [BTC] as investments, according to a Livedoor report. In recent years, the cryptocurrency market has grown massively, with the U.S leading in institutional adoption via ETFs. The crypto holdings of the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, recently crossed $100 billion. Other banks and investment firms like JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley allow wealthy clients to have crypto exposure in the U.S. In July, Standard Chartered also made a similar move for its U.K. customers, starting with BTC and Ethereum [ETH]. At that time, the banking giant said there was “growing interest in regulated digital asset solutions.” To achieve and catch up with its counterparts in the U.S, Japan seeks to expand its regulatory clarity to allow crypto in banking investments. Per Livedoor, a working group under the Prime Minister is set to discuss the new guidelines to allow banks to act as crypto exchanges. Given crypto’s volatility, the risk mitigation system for banks will also be explored to ensure the safety of the institutions. In June, the FSA proposed a reclassification of crypto assets into “financial products” to pave the way for crypto ETFs (exchange-traded funds). It is the same framework that applies to securities and other traditional financial products in Japan. Pundits also highlighted that the move would slash crypto taxes from over 50% to 20%. Given the similar treatment as traditional stocks, the country also banned crypto insider trading with new rules. Collectively, the recent updates have been geared towards ensuring user protections and further adoption. In fact, Chainalysis’s report singled out Japan as the fastest-growing crypto market across the broader Asia-Pacific region in 2025. It saw a 120% crypto market growth thanks to regulatory shifts, with Ripple [XRP] as the dominant crypto asset. Indonesia, South Korea, and India followed closely at 103%, 100% and 99% growth rates.

Title: BlackRock to Develop Tokenization Tech as Bitcoin ETF Passes $100 Billion in Assets

BlackRock is developing technology to tokenize a wide range of assets and expand its digital investment offerings. BlackRock is developing its own technology to tokenize a broad range of assets, from real estate to equities and bonds. CEO Larry Fink said the global market currently holds more than $4.5 trillion in digital wallets, spanning crypto, stablecoins, and tokenized assets. “A lot of that money is outside the United States,” Fink said on CNBC earlier today, emphasizing the opportunity for the firm to reach new investors through digital channels. Fink said tokenization could allow investors who are entering markets through crypto to access more traditional long-term products, such as retirement funds. “If we could tokenize an ETF, we could get them into the more traditional long-term retirement products,” he said, pointing to BlackRock’s digital platforms, which include tokenized money market funds and Bitcoin investments that have grown to over $100 billion. Fink also said yesterday that Bitcoin and crypto “serve same purpose as gold.” BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, launched just 21 months ago, is BlackRock’s most profitable fund — outranking even products that have been in circulation for more than two decades. The firm’s growth extends beyond digital assets. Fink highlighted record inflows across ETFs, private markets, AI-driven equity strategies, and investment technology platforms. “It wasn’t just one product area. It was not just one region. It was a completeness,” he said, noting the breadth of BlackRock’s growth across business lines. Fink credited the firm’s strategy of combining active and passive management, public and private markets, and technology overlays for driving this expansion. Fink also stressed the value of long-term investing in his chat: “It’s not about if our market’s going up or down, is there a bubble in crypto or technology. It’s about being in the market throughout the cycle,” he said. He underscored the power of compounding over decades, noting that even a small additional return can significantly grow a retirement portfolio over a 30-year horizon. Looking ahead, Fink said regulatory clarity in the U.S. and further investment in digital asset innovation will be critical to supporting market growth. “We’re just at the beginning of the tokenization of all assets,” he said. The firm expects that over the coming decades, tokenized financial products will allow investors to remain within a digital ecosystem while accessing the full spectrum of traditional and alternative investments.

October 19, 2025 13:44 ET | Source: NB HASH NB HASH London, United Kingdom, Oct. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As inflation persists and global interest rates continue to fall, institutional capital is searching for a new destination that offers both stability and yield.This month, investment giant BlackRock made headlines by expanding its exposure to Real-World Assets (RWA) — a move that many analysts see as the clearest sign yet that real-asset tokenization has entered the mainstream.While large institutions are beginning to capitalize on this opportunity, NB HASH is taking it a step further — opening the door for everyday investors to participate in the same asset-backed yield strategies that Wall Street is now chasing. From Institutions to Individuals: The Rise of RWA RWA (Real-World Assets) refers to the tokenization of tangible, income-producing assets — such as energy facilities, infrastructure capacity, or data-center power — and bringing those assets onto the blockchain.Unlike traditional crypto speculation, RWA projects are tied directly to real economic output, creating stable, transparent, and verifiable income.NB HASH leverages this model by linking its investment ecosystem to audited real-world resources including: “RWA is no longer a concept reserved for institutions,” said an NB HASH spokesperson.“We make it possible for anyone with USDT to participate in assets that produce real-world cash flow — not just speculative value.” Illustrative Earning Scenarios NB HASH’s RWA products are structured around verified real-asset performance. Returns are calculated and distributed through on-chain smart contracts, ensuring transparency and traceability. Figures shown are for illustration only and do not constitute a guarantee of return. Actual performance may vary based on market and project factors. Why Now — and Why RWA Matters Analysts from Goldman Sachs and BlackRock alike point to the same macro backdrop driving this shift: As a result, RWA has emerged as the bridge between traditional finance and digital value, and NB HASH is among the first platforms to offer it to the public with full transparency and daily on-chain settlement.

Title: Sarsfields ease past Midleton to regain Cork crown

RTÉ Sport contributor Sarsfields 2-18 Midleton 1-14 Sarsfields lifted their second Co-op SuperStores Premier Senior Hurling Championship title in three seasons following a seven-point victory over Midleton at SuperValu Páirc Uí Chaoimh. The Riverstown-based club made light work of their divisional rivals with player of the match Jack O'Connor hitting 0-05 and James Sweeney getting two goals. The result adds another chapter into the story being written by management duo Johnny Crowley and Diarmuid O’Sullivan, and it follows success in last year’s Munster championship and three consecutive Cork league titles. It felt like business as usual for the club and their reward was a comfortable 1-09 to 1-03 advantage at the interval. Midleton were missing Conor Lehane and Eoin Moloney, two important components in the team that reached the final via victories over Glen Rovers and Blackrock. Clinical finish from James Sweeney after being set up by Cian Darcy as @SarsfieldsCork register their first green flag in the @OfficialCorkGAA final #rtegaa #sundaygame pic.twitter.com/NGuG8EC15k The Magpies only led once, through an Evan McGrath green flag at the City End in the 10th minute after a mistake by the Sars back-line presented the midfielder with an open goal. That made the scoreboard read 1-00 to 0-02 and the soon to be champions immediately went back in front through a brace of Colm McCarthy frees. O’Connor then got in on the action, just before Sweeney rifled the back of the net with a blistering strike after collecting a pass from Cian Darcy. That made it 1-05 to 1-00 and the first half finished with a burst by Midleton that wasn’t enough to dent Sars’ lead or confidence. The game restarted with O’Connor splitting the posts and McCarthy getting his seventh, as their overall lead grew to 1-11 to 1-03. Full-time: @SarsfieldsCork 2-18 @MidletonGaa 1-14 James Sweeney slips home his second goal to ensure that Sarsfields regain the @OfficialCorkGAA senior hurling title, the eighth in their history #rtegaa #sundaygame pic.twitter.com/dJC2GQm8W4 The Magpies did make of a game of it in the end, by bringing it back to four points as more and more black and white jerseys began finding space. This started with a burst that involved Mikey Finn nailing a free and a 45, in addition to Killian McDermott sneaking the sliotar over from the tightest of angles. Then came a goal chance at the near post from Alex Quirke and this was scrambled off the line by Sars. A green flag would have made it a two point game, instead it galvanised the eventual champions as they came through the next 20 minutes without a scratch from their divisional rivals. Even when Midleton got it back to four at 1-13 to 1-09, they remained in control and saw out the game with O’Connor scoring three points from play. Sweeney rounded out the win in the dying seconds with a close range goal after escaping his marker at the City End. Sarsfields: Ben Graham; Conor O’Sullivan, Cillian Roche, Donal English; Bryan Murphy, Luke Elliott, Craig Leahy; Daniel Hogan (0-1), Killian Murphy (0-1); Jack O’Connor (0-5), Colm McCarthy (0-8, 7f), Cian Darcy (0-1); Daniel Kearney, James Sweeney (2-0), Barry O’Flynn (0-1).

Title: Sunday Summary: Marc Holliday Is Not Playing Around

© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy SL Green Realty’s earnings call last week was pretty good. The largest office owner in New York City saw cash flow increase ($164.4 million versus $155.9 million the previous quarter). They scored profitable sales. And leasing was downright great —Teneo Holdings, the global consulting firm, took 46,551 square feet at 280 Park Avenue, and asset management firm Sagard Capital Partners added 31,580 square feet to its previous 8,936 square feet at the same address; at One Madison Avenue, SL Green leased the sixth floor (92,663 square feet) to Harvey AI Corporation; and over at the Lipstick Building (885 Third Avenue) the law firm Fox Horan & Camerini signed a 19,200-square-foot lease. All very good. But the thing that most caught our attention was the big continuation bet CEO Marc Holliday just put on Midtown the day before the call: $730 million on 65 East 55th Street (aka Park Avenue Tower), which the REIT is buying from Blackstone. A month earlier, Holliday scooped up 346 Madison Avenue — the former home of Brooks Brothers — and 11 East 44th Street from Claudio Del Vecchio for $160 million. On the call, Holliday gave a sense of what SL Green has planned. “Over the past five years, we saw the heightened demand for well-located Park Avenue and Grand Central assets long before the competition, and now it’s truly paying off,” Holliday said. “Earlier in the quarter, we delivered on our goal of identifying a major new development site, acquiring 346 Madison Avenue and 11 East 44th across the street from One Vanderbilt. This is the perfect place to build the next great building.” Hopefully this can make up for losing out on SL Green’s proposed casino in Times Square — although this might have been a blessing in disguise for the real estate giant. A firm further along in the bidding process for a downstate gaming license, MGM Empire City, looked at the numbers for a Yonkers casino and said, “Thanks, but no thanks.” And, maybe it’s just us, but we’re seeing a pattern. The major developers and tenants are betting big on the Plaza District. BXP found an anchor for its $2 billion, 930,000-square-foot 343 Madison Avenue: The insurance and investment giant C.V. Starr, which is taking about 30 percent of the unbuilt tower. And fashion deity Prada is getting pretty ambitious with its plans for 720-724 Fifth Avenue — they’re currently finishing up talks with Related Companies to build a skyscraper on the prime spot. A few other sites are wooing tenants and, given the fact that new office construction ground to a halt during the pandemic, these sites are actually poised to do extremely well. Not everyone wants to talk about office By sheer numbers, the deal of the week has to be the dizzying, $40 billion bet that is being organized by BlackRock — and includes firms NVIDIA, Microsoft and MGX — for Aligned Data Centers, which consists of about 50 data center campuses globally (with a lot more on the way) to cater to AI mania. And that’s hardly the only big asset bet last week. Whatever anyone thinks about the hospitality market, Cain is seeing the value of the the Dominick Hotel at SoHo’s 246 Spring Street, having plunked down $175 million for the 390-key lodging, which will be reopened as a Delano hotel. Speaking of Cain, they’ve also been planning a lush new park as part of the multibillion-dollar One Beverly Hills in Southern California. This is notable because parks are an increasingly rarefied amenity, with an average of 6,000 acres of open space going bye-bye throughout the country every single day. (Sheesh! When did fresh air and grass become luxuries?) “Land is a finite resource, and it’s an incredibly important one for our cities and communities, and there are a lot of pressures on how we use that land,” said Bianca Clarke of the Trust for Public Land. “The problem is, if we use land for uses other than public spaces, it’s really difficult then to create public spaces where we need them.” The building of parks has fallen increasingly on developers, with private developers accounting for 67 percent of the park and greenway space in 10 major cities in the country. Housing, housing, housing! But the asset we want to talk about most this week is not hospitality, data centers or office. It’s housing. Part of the reason is because of the activity: the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles (HACLA) plunked down $49.7 million for the 154-unit Emerald Apartments in Downtown L.A.; Crescent Heights nabbed a $238.4 million refinancing for Forma, its 40-story, 588-unit luxury tower in Miami’s Edgewater (which comes with a Whole Foods to boot!); and the Miami-based Resident Group secured a $113.8 million refinancing from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for a 32-story, 279-unit luxury tower, also in Edgewater (honestly, we didn’t know HUD backed luxury housing). And we would be lax if we failed to mention that Midtown Park, the $2 billion mixed-use project in Miami from Rosso Development, Midtown Development and Proper Hospitality, got approval last week from the Urban Development Review Board to begin construction. However, the reason we’re most excited about housing this week is that CO dropped its first ever Power Residential list on Tuesday. The list represents our selections for the 35 most important names in residential real estate throughout the country. Some are developers who have quietly built tens of thousands of houses and apartment buildings. Others are brokers who moved billions of dollars worth of luxury condos. There are architects, lawyers and reality TV stars among their number. Take a leisurely look through it. See you next week! Read the latest edition of the Commercial Observer online!

Title: Cardano’s Charles Hoskinson Chimes in on Bitcoin’s 4-Year Cycle Discourse
URL: https://zycrypto.com/cardanos-charles-hoskinson-chimes-in-on-bitcoins-4-year-cycle-discourse/
Time Published: 2025-10-19T09:33:31Z
Full Content:
Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson believes the long-standing idea of Bitcoin’s four-year market cycle may soon become obsolete. In an interview with CNBC, Hoskinson argued that as institutional players like BlackRock and Fidelity deepen their involvement in the market, Bitcoin’s historical rhythm of boom-and-bust tied to halving events could fade away. For more than a decade, Bitcoin’s price action has followed a familiar four-year pattern, rising sharply after each halving, reaching new highs, and then retracing by as much as 85% before stabilizing. Hoskinson suggested that this predictable pattern no longer fits the realities of a maturing market. “I don’t think we’re gonna see those kinds of cycles anymore because there is too much money in the space and there is too much market structure,” he said, adding that complex financial products like synthetics and derivatives will dampen volatility. According to Hoskinson, the inflow of institutional capital will create “stronger floors and less volatility,” gradually pushing Bitcoin toward more stable price behavior. He also predicted that this stability will play a crucial role in onboarding the next half a billion users to crypto, with regulatory developments and risk-managed products reinforcing investor confidence. Despite his skepticism about Bitcoin’s four-year rhythm, Hoskinson believes altcoin seasons will persist. He recalled how the last cycle revolved around the search for an “Ethereum killer,” spawning projects like Solana and Polkadot. In the next phase, he expects privacy-oriented platforms to take center stage, highlighting Cardano’s own Midnight project, which he says addresses issues such as oracles and stablecoins while strengthening the Cardano ecosystem. Analysts like João Wedson, Alphractal CEO and verified CryptoQuant analyst, argue that the four-year fractal cycle remains intact, pointing to Bitcoin’s recent market behavior as proof. Others, like popular investor Ted Pillows, believe the absence of a euphoric blow-off top this time signals an evolving, liquidity-driven market that could see Bitcoin extend its rally into 2026.

Title: Crypto Market Players are Anticipating These 4 Bullish Events, Here’s Why

The crypto market is entering a potentially decisive phase as investors track four developments that could shape sentiment for the rest of 2025. Experts anticipate a possible end to the Federal Reserve’s tightening campaign and a wave of pending ETF decisions that could widen institutional access to digital assets. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell suggested this week that the central bank’s balance sheet runoff, known as quantitative tightening, may be nearing its conclusion. Speaking at the National Association for Business Economics conference, Powell noted that bank reserves were approaching an ample level, hinting that quantitative tightening could end in the coming months. Markets interpreted the comments as a sign that liquidity conditions could soon ease, a scenario historically supportive for risk assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Adding to the optimism, Fed Governor Michelle Bowman reaffirmed the likelihood of two interest rate cuts before the end of 2025, saying the labor market’s slowdown justifies a gradual policy pivot. Investors view such a shift as a green light for growth sectors. “When the Fed begins an easing cycle, bonds in the middle of the curve, around three to seven years, often strike the right balance of income and protection,” said Gargi Pal Chaudhuri, Chief Investment and Portfolio Strategist Americas at BlackRock. Another major catalyst looms on the regulatory front. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission faces final deadlines this month for 16 crypto-linked exchange-traded funds (ETFs), covering tokens such as Solana, XRP, Litecoin, and Dogecoin. Bloomberg’s James Seyffart and ETF Store president Nate Geraci have called October a make-or-break period for the sector, with approval of even a handful of products expected to unlock fresh institutional inflows. Together, the potential end of quantitative tightening, prospects of rate cuts, and mounting anticipation over ETF approvals are forming a rare alignment of bullish factors for digital assets. As industry analyst Lark Davis put it, you might be missing what’s coming next if you “still think the crypto market has topped.”

Title: Spiritan survivor calls for swifter redress and apology

Time Published: 2025-10-19T06:00:00Z

Ailbhe Conneely Social Affairs & Religion Correspondent "I feel very empty, very raw, I'm missing him terribly." The words of David Ryan when asked how he is feeling following the second anniversary of his late brother Mark. "Two years on, it hits more, and while I’m more grounded, it’s poignant that he’s gone two years," he says. David and Mark Ryan were catapulted into the spotlight three years ago following the broadcast of RTÉ’s Doc on One programme 'Blackrock Boys’. The brothers spoke publicly about the sexual abuse they suffered as boys on the campus of Blackrock College in Dublin run by the Spiritan Order. Their bravery and the manner in which they told their story resulted in former students contacting RTÉ’s Liveline programme, alleging historical physical and sexual abuse. It all snowballed into hundreds of cases of alleged abuse being reported to gardaí as well as to the organisation One in Four - which supports survivors of child sexual abuse. Fr Martin Kelly offered a public apology to all victims and survivors on behalf of the Spiritan congregation, and independent experts were brought in by the order to guide survivors through a restorative justice programme. The Spiritan Restorative Justice Framework has six elements including an apology, therapy, testimony (truth telling), redress, memorialisation and restorative justice. Just half of those have been activated in full, according to a group which represents some of the victims/survivors called Restore Together. "Dragging its heels" Outstanding issues include redress, over which; the Order has been accused of "dragging its heels". Just over a week ago, the Spiritans denied deliberately delaying or obstructing the progress on a redress scheme. It confirmed that Rockwell Farm, (at Rockwell College in Co Tipperary), would be the first of the properties to be sold. It has been put on the market with an asking price of €21m, a sum which is "only the tip of the iceberg", according to David Ryan. Speaking from his home, Mr Ryan questioned the length of time it would take for the Order to untie itself from assets, to provide redress to survivors. "We’re three years since the Doc on One, what’s happened in three years? Very little." Since ‘Blackrock Boys’ aired in November 2022, David Ryan has twice been bereaved. The unexpected death of Mark in September 2023 received national attention. More recently, the death of David’s mother has focused his mind on the fleeting nature of life. He acknowledges the establishment of the Commission of Investigation into the Handling of Historical Child Sexual Abuse in Schools as a step, however there’s concern over the length of time it could take. "He (Judge Michael McGrath) will need to go through lots of reports, police statements and judging by how many victims/survivors that came forward through the Scoping Inquiry, and more are expected, it could be a long-drawn-out process which will frustrate people." There are reports that the commission could take five years, which, according to Mr Ryan, "is just way too long; survivors will be dead". "Lack of apology" A significant grievance of the now 61-year-old is a "lack of an apology" from the Taoiseach, which he called for in September 2024. Simon Harris TD who held the position at the time said he could not see a scenario where there would not be a State apology. Mr Ryan has been waiting to hear from Taoiseach Micheál Martin since he took up his role and is much aggrieved over the lack of an apology to victims and survivors. For two decades One In Four has supported David Ryan and tomorrow will launch its 2024 annual report. The announcement of the Scoping Inquiry in 2023 led to an increase in waiting lists for treatment and therapy from the organisation. It is likely that more victims/survivors sought help from the organisation last year, due to the publication of Mary O'Toole's report which found almost 2,400 allegations of sexual abuse in respect of 308 schools recorded by religious orders that ran the schools. When he first approached One in Four twenty years ago, David Ryan’s "head was on the ground". Such was the level of abuse and trauma he had endured; Mr Ryan would not attend a public bathroom, stay in a hotel, or go to a pool. He still can’t attend an indoor swimming pool, but with significant therapy in recent years he can use outdoor swimming areas. Through therapy and support, he acknowledges "he’s a different person now". He describes it as being "deprogrammed", requiring huge work on his part - reliving the abuse, playing it back and flashbacks. "I don’t blame myself any longer, it wasn’t my fault and looking back on it, they were the sick people, not me. "It’s only in the last year really that I'm accepting what happened to me."

Title: Stephen Donnelly swoops to the rescue of UK healthcare citing his triumphs in Ireland

Unemployment has sent good hardworking Irish people on the boat to seek their fortune in Britain for centuries now, and it’s no different for former minister for health Stephen Donnelly, who will be rolling up his sleeves with CF, a healthcare management consultant. Quite how the UK, home of the world’s first modern universal free-at-the-point-of-use healthcare system, wound up requiring expertise from Ireland, home of it costing €60 to have a doctor tell you to keep an eye on it, is a contemplation for another day. CF spared no fireworks in their announcement of the former Fianna Fáil brainiac who was punted unceremoniously to touch by the people of Wicklow last year. Unappreciated by the hill tribes of Delgany and Roundwood, he “designed and led the most comprehensive programme of investment and reform in Ireland’s public health services in decades”, said the announcement. “Stephen brings something truly unique to our UK transformation work – direct experience designing and implementing the exact type of comprehensive national health system reform that the UK government is now prioritising,” said Hannah Farrar, chief executive of CF. He’ll help the company be consulted in the UK, where the cracks in society are growing wider and ministers can offer only words like “we will harness AI” to fill them. He will also work on expanding the business across Europe and the Middle East, where reforms are also in the offing. “Some years ago I left healthcare consulting in the UK to enter parliament in Ireland,” said Donnelly in his announcement on LinkedIn, somewhat minimising his 13 years in the Dáil including a spell as founder/ co-leader of the Social Democrats and five years as minister for health. “While there is still much to be done, crucial improvements were achieved,” he said, slipping comfortably back into the metrical worldview of the business-wonk, listing his achievements as follows: “a 60 per cent reduction in long waiters; a 50 per cent reduction in outpatient and 30 per cent reduction in surgical waiting times; a shift of care from hospitals to the community; an end to falling productivity; vital new patient services including a transformation of women’s health services; a new eHealth plan; a step change in public health and preventative care; rebalancing the regional deployment of health assets.” Sounds like a record of delivery that could be of interest to the Health Service Executive (HSE), which is already regularly spending more than €100 million a year on external consultants, many of whom have never even been minister for health. The youth of Ireland can rest easy: they have an ally in Frank McDonald, former Irish Times environment editor and author of several books about Dublin’s transformation into a kip. The renowned critic joined Labour, Green and Independent councillors in a judicial review of the Government’s planned changes to apartment standards, characterised by the group as a “developer-led race to the bottom”. He filed an affidavit outlining his bona fides (various books, various honours), his shock at the manner of the plans being introduced (“I was aghast”) and his proposed remedy (quash the plans, do an environmental assessment). McDonald, the inadequately housed will be happy to hear, recently “moved out to Blackrock” where he lives in a “spacious new apartment on the top floor of a three-storey block”. It boasts “views south towards Three Rock Mountain”, he told the High Court, calling up what a High Court judge might consider a familiar and aesthetically appealing vista. “I could spend my time reading novels and drinking champagne on our planted terrace,” he went on, no doubt sparking serious interest from judges at this stage. [ Is Ireland ready for drab Soviet-style apartment blocks?Opens in new window ] But no – he has chosen to fight for the younger generation, whose “plight will be aggravated by the dystopian future set out for them by the new apartment design standards referred to above, which effectively guarantee that they will have no option but to pay dearly for Lilliputian living spaces in glorified 21st-century tenements”. So, like Bruce Wayne before him, he has set the champagne aside and joined the fight. The Government, extremely annoyed by all this, says it plans to fight back “robustly”. The youth could use such a champion when it comes to “deemed disposal”, Brian Cowen’s tax on unrealised investment gains that is felt as a deep injustice by the type of person who has unrealised investment gains. Gen Z worldwide is interested in stocks and shares, having come of financial age during a long period where the lines have been heading in the right direction and their capital, while at risk, goes up rather than down. Irish dabblers might start out following US advice, before encountering decidedly un-free market taxes taking a bite out of their profits. Last week, in the hotbed of radical political thought that is “r/irishpersonalfinance”, the savings-and-investments subforum of social media network Irish Reddit, a user popped up with a plan: a national walkout to end deemed disposal. [ How Gen Z is taking a different approach to money - and what others can learn from itOpens in new window ] “This Monday, at 2pm, we walk out of our schools, colleges and places of work,” the user wrote, in a hint at his youth, “demanding change”. “For too long, the ruling coalition has ruled by diktat, without the slightest thought toward the preferences of the electorate,” quoth the rabble-rouser with a touch of (James) Connolly to his rhetoric. “A people shouldn’t acquiesce to their government, the government should follow the will of the people.” Monday, October 13th, came and went, and despite the poster’s claim that he had the support of “the rest of my placement cohort at the Big Four consulting company I work at”, Bastilles went unstormed and the fetters on free enterprise remained in place. One to keep an eye on though. If this keeps up, the Progressive Democrats might spontaneously reappear. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: David McCullagh: ‘There’s plenty of people in the long grass hoping I’ll fall flat on my face’

David McCullagh says it’s definitely time for him to move to radio. “In the space of a week before the summer, women approached me at random on two separate occasions and told me I looked much better on telly.” One of these unsolicited verdicts on his real-life appearance was delivered just outside the RTÉ campus in Montrose, Dublin. “I went in and told the make-up department. They were delighted,” he says. As I meet the journalist, presenter and historian (57) in a hotel lounge not far from Montrose, he’s limbering up to swap the Six One television news for Radio 1’s Today with David McCullagh – and poised to publish his latest book, From Crown to Harp. Completed with the aid of a “really, really handy bout of insomnia”, the book covers the 28-year period in which the Anglo-Irish Treaty was undone, with McCullagh exploring three decades of fractious negotiations and much-contested shifts in symbolism. He cites an October 1921 cartoon in British satirical magazine Punch in which an Irish nationalist, asking if the inn he finds himself in is the Harp, is told it’s the Crown and Harp. “But I don’t think you’ll find it any less comfortable for that,” the innkeeper replies. “It sort of encapsulates the British attitude of ‘all we’re asking you, all we’re asking you, is to give us our symbol, and it will have no practical difference. And to an extent that was true, to an extent they were lying through their teeth.” Evolving expressions of identity from stamps, coins and passports to flags and anthems are covered, though especially fun to consider now are the diplomatic exchanges over recognition of the Irish president in official toasts. “It seems kind of arcane and not worth bothering about, but if you feel you’re in a position of inferiority and you want to assert your independence, sovereignty and identity, it really is important, and you’re prepared to fight for it,” he says. One key theme is that few in Dublin were interested in using the Free State’s association with the Commonwealth to try to achieve unity – the removal of partition just wasn’t a priority. “Every time there was a choice between extending sovereignty or limiting it to make a connection with unionists, politicians of all parties down here went for sovereignty.” His catalyst was a “lovely, thoughtful present” Miriam O’Callaghan gave him when he left Prime Time in 2020: the Saorstát Éireann Official Handbook. He was fascinated by how various essayists in the 1932-published book downplayed constitutional links with Britain and “put the best possible gloss” on the State’s international standing. Two years later, while in London covering Queen Elizabeth’s funeral, he was struck by how “deeply odd” certain elements seemed. “The Lord Chamberlain was going to break his wand of office and place it on her coffin, and I thought, ‘That’s a bit Harry Potter, isn’t it?’ It just got me thinking. The whole thing about the Crown was the cause of the Civil War, in effect, and yet it’s the kind of thing that we, at this stage, don’t really regard as being of any importance.” I was in Leinster House for 12 years ... you do become institutionalised The book only took three years – “pretty fast by my standards” – as he was able to draw on research he had done for his biographies of Éamon de Valera and another former taoiseach, John A Costello. [ Dev – Rise and Rule review: Chatty, well-made series fails to decode Éamon de ValeraOpens in new window ] Still, he found he had “quite a bit to do”, from trawling through the UK’s National Archives in Kew to “joining the dots in a slightly different way”, and he’d sold the project to his wife, Anne-Marie Smyth, on the basis that it would be straightforward. “She was very enthusiastic about it, possibly because I lied to her about how long it would take.” Free State to Republic was his planned title, but Smyth – who edits RTÉ’s children’s news programme, news2day – proposed From Crown to Harp. “Yeah, she’s good at these things,” he says. He also obtained the required permission from RTÉ management. Would this be a different book if he wasn’t an employee of RTÉ? “No, I don’t think so. Certainly, consciously, there was nothing where I thought ‘I better not say that’. Like, it’s sufficiently far in the past, I think, that it probably won’t come back to bite me. But then lots of people have thought that about lots of things. Ha!” Everything seems to be happening at once for McCullagh, with September seeing the broadcast of his two-part series on de Valera, Dev: Rise and Rule. In it he detailed how no trace has ever been found of Vivion de Valera, the man said to be his father. He worried that the coverage this sparked “gave the impression that we were maybe being a bit tabloid about it”, but he was pleased overall by the reception, and the ratings were “not quite The Traitors, but not bad”. When I mention that my first introduction to Dev as a child in 1980s Dublin was the skipping rhyme that began “vote, vote, vote for de Valera”, he says a friend told him similar, but only after he’d spent eight years writing his two-volume biography. “So, useless!” he declares cheerily. “You’re useless as well!” The new book is dedicated to his parents, Robin and June, who are “still hale and hearty, thankfully” and did a lot for him and his older brother when they were growing up in Dublin, on Newtownpark Avenue in Blackrock. After studying history and politics at UCD, his career began when he was hired by the Evening Press in 1989. A subsequent Master’s degree “became a PhD, which became a book” – A Makeshift Majority, about the 1948-1951 government – and he discovered he enjoyed longer forms of writing than the “12-14 paragraphs, tops” he had at the newspaper or, later, the 300 words he could squeeze into a typical TV report. He joined RTÉ in September 1993 and after various gigs became political correspondent in 2001. “I was in Leinster House for 12 years. [It] sounds like a prison sentence, and you do become institutionalised.” [ RTÉ’s new radio schedule a hurried defensive reflex to sour taste left by Ray D’Arcy exitOpens in new window ] Lots of late nights? “It was mad, particularly because I was there during the whole bailout and everything. It was just the maddest time ever.” He recalls the chaotic January 2011 day when Fianna Fáil TDs openly conspired outside the Dáil chamber to oust then taoiseach Brian Cowen. “Normally they do their plotting and back-stabbing in private, but they were doing it completely in the open. Wild. Absolutely wild.” Plunging into history – which he self-deprecatingly calls his “schtick” – helps him unwind from the intensity of unfolding political drama, and it has underlined for him, too, how so much of politics is about personal relationships. I ask what he thought about Leo Varadkar’s memoir, but he hasn’t read it yet – it’s on his list. “I’m banned from purchasing books for myself from September to Christmas, because my birthday is in December, and apparently I’m very difficult to buy for,” he says, with a gentle strain of mock indignation. Varadkar has said it was McCullagh’s advice that inspired him to release it. Mcullagh confirms: “I told him that if you don’t write your version of history, people in the future will rely on some other fella’s version of history, and it might not be to your benefit.” Perhaps his own book might be a good Christmas gift option for the tough-to-buy-for demographic? “Oh, absolutely,” he says quickly. “Every home should have at least one copy, if not two.” He was ready to move on from Leinster House when Pat Kenny’s surprise departure for Newstalk triggered that station’s “move the dial” campaign and left a vacancy on Prime Time. His seven years on the current affairs flagship were “good times, happy times”. Presenting the Six One “wasn’t something that I particularly envisaged for myself”, but he has enjoyed that too. The big switch to Today has been instigated by another defection to Newstalk, this time Claire Byrne’s. McCullagh is one of those broadcasting heavyweights who wears his intellect lightly, and his reporting experience, depth of insight and tonal flexibility should combine to make him a strong and entertaining successor. But the job, which pays a salary of €209,000, also comes with pressure to maintain the show’s listenership amid direct competition from “class act” Byrne. Will his Today be different from Byrne’s Today? “I guess if you change presenter, it’s inevitably going to have some differences, but I mean it’s a very successful programme and people like it.” True, Today’s buoyant listener figures throughout the Kenny, Sean O’Rourke and Byrne eras imply that the midmorning show’s format and slot – rescheduled after we meet to start one hour earlier – are more important than the presenter. “So they can put any eejit in and it won’t matter. I see what you’re saying there, Laura!” Well, he doesn’t want to be the one to break that streak, does he? “No, no, indeed,” he says. “But, you know, the dial moves both ways.” Unfortunately, my face betrays me sometimes He will finish on the Six One on Halloween night, then start on Today soon after. He will also stop co-hosting RTÉ’s Behind the Story podcast – “I think 10 hours of me on air a week is probably enough” – but he credits it with getting him out of his comfort zone and showing people he isn’t always completely serious. His eyebrows go into immediate overdrive after I note that viewers often respond to his facial expressions. There can be some side-eye, too, I suggest, referencing one screengrab, captured during an election debate in 2020, that became a meme. “That was weird, it’s become a bit of a thing, but I wasn’t aware the camera was on me. I was actually trying to communicate with the editor in the gallery.” The eyebrow gymnastics, and everything else, are all “completely unconscious”, he says. “Unfortunately, my face betrays me sometimes.” Surely, in these days of visual radio, he will still be on screen? “It’ll all be on webcam, and apparently you’ll be able to see me on the RTÉ News channel, unless something better is on.” He reminisces about how the addition of cameras meant he had to be “careful with the hand signals” when he returned to Radio 1’s This Week in 2018. “It nearly got me in trouble a couple of times,” he says. What kind of hand signals? “Let’s not go there!” When he’s not working or writing, he swims, reads “quite a lot” and watches TV with his wife – the couple live in Stillorgan, while their daughter, Rosie (24), is studying in London. He goes to Leinster rugby matches and gigs when he can, one artist being especially close to his heart – in 2022, he said he’d been to see Bruce Springsteen 33 times. “Ah, that was then,” he says. The updated tally is 41. The last two times he brought Rosie, and she loved it. “That was just fantastic, because I think I probably overdid playing the Springsteen songs for her when she was growing up, and she wasn’t really into it then.” Sending From Crown to Harp to the printers was “a great relief”, he says, and he’s excited now about his Today adventure. “But it’s a challenge, and I’m sure there’s plenty of people out there in the long grass hoping I’ll fall flat on my face.” I don’t know who they would be, I say. Has he got a bitter rival at RTÉ? “Oh god, no. It’s all sweetness and light in RTÉ.” From Crown to Harp by David McCullagh is published by Gill.

Title: $536M In Sell Pressure: Why Bitcoin And Ethereum Prices Crashed

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. The cryptocurrency market has been hit with another wave of sell pressure as both the Bitcoin and Ethereum prices plunged sharply, triggering widespread panic and uncertainty. With over $536 million in Spot Bitcoin ETF outflows in a single day, the downturn has sparked renewed fears of an extended bearish phase. Analysts are calling this correction a “Bloody Friday,” a less but still severe reflection of last week’s brutal selloff that wiped billions in the market and saw BTC and ETH spiraling downwards. The recent crash in Bitcoin and Ethereum prices is being attributed to recent large-scale outflows from US Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Crypto analyst Jana on X social media described the event as one of the bloodiest weekly downturns of the quarter, with Bitcoin tumbling 13.3% in seven days and Ethereum sliding 17.8% over the past month. At press time, Bitcoin is trading slightly above $106,940 while Ethereum sits around $3,870, both suffering steep retracements from their recent highs. Data from SoSoValue shows that Thursday, October 16, saw a staggering $536.4 million in daily net outflows from Spot Bitcoin ETFs, marking the largest single-day negative flow since August 1, when $812 million exited the market. Out of twelve US Bitcoin ETFs, eight registered major outflows, led by $275.15 million leaving Ark & 21Shares’ ARKB, followed by $132 million from Fidelity’s FBTC. Notably, funds managed by other major companies like Grayscale, BlackRock, Bitwise, VanEck, and Valkyrie also reported significant withdrawals. These persistent outflows have now stretched into their third consecutive day, with October 17, just a day ago, recording a massive outflow of $366.5 million. The sustained negative ETF flows underscore waning investor confidence and suggest that the broader market downturn could continue in the near term. Combined with the $19 billion liquidation event last Friday, increased outflows in ETFs could put more selling pressure on the already fragile market. Many experts believe that the crypto market may still have more room for a decline. Data from Polymarket, one of the world’s largest prediction platforms, show that 52% of participants expect Bitcoin to drop below $100,000 before the end of October. Veteran economist and Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff has also warned that the coming months could be catastrophic for the industry, predicting widespread bankruptcies, defaults, and layoffs as Bitcoin and Ethereum face another major leg down. Meanwhile, technical analysts are pointing to signs of deeper weakness in Ethereum’s structure. According to Crypto Damus, Ethereum has broken key weekly support and is displaying a bearish setup on the charts. He says that MACD is about to “cross red,” leaving a significant amount of room for a crash. Other analysts like Marzell have echoed similar concerns, stating that Ethereum is now nearing a “crash zone.” However, he also highlighted the $3,690 – $3,750 range as a possible short-term demand area where buyers could step in again and trigger the next leg up.

U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) hemorrhaged money Thursday, snapping a two-week streak of consistent inflows as participants continue to tread carefully in the wake of Friday’s historic flash crash. The 11 funds recorded $536.4 million in net outflows, marking the sharpest single-day capital flight since August 1. Ark $ 21Shares’ ARKB suffered the largest outflow with $275.15 million exiting, while Fidelity’s FBTC posted $132 million in withdrawals, and Grayscale’s converted GBTC product witnessed $45 million flee, according to SoSoValue data. Spot ETFs managed by BlackRock, Bitwise, VanEck, and Valkyrie also saw capital exodus. Spot Ethereum ETFs also registered $56.8 million in net outflows on Thursday, ending the positive inflow streak witnessed in the previous two trading days. Grayscale’s ETHE suffered the largest single-day outflow with $69 million exiting on Oct. 16, while Bitwise’s ETHW saw $15.8 million flee. The dwindling demand comes as markets continue to nurse losses after President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social that he would impose 100% tariffs on all Chinese imports, responding to Beijing’s threat to cut off exports of rare earth minerals, which are vital to U.S. technology manufacturing. The surprise announcement sparked the biggest liquidation event on record, with $19 billion in leveraged positions wiped out within 24 hours. While Bitcoin recovered to around $115,000 earlier this week after Trump seemingly tried to de-escalate the tariff war, tensions continue. Crypto prices extended their corrections today, with BTC, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, plummeting to as low as $103,856 in the past day. Meanwhile, Ethereum blockchain’s native token, Ether, fell 1.9% to $3,829 alongside bigger losses in the altcoin market, according to CoinGecko data.

One important source to distil their India plans is from their quarterly earnings calls. With the September earnings season having just begun, starting this week we will bring to you what CXOs of global corporations are saying about India and their perspectives and plans in this column. Here are some from companies that reported their earnings so far. BlackRock Inc (BLK, $182.3 billion) The world’s largest asset manager said its JioBlackRock venture marks a key step in expanding access to local investing and retirement products in India. “The Indian market remains largely untapped and is today a country of savers rather than investors. Through JioBlackRock, we’re enabling individuals to more easily invest in their local economies and financial assets.” Brown-Forman Corp (BFB, $13.4 billion) The American spirits-maker sees India as a major long-term growth engine for its flagship Jack Daniel’s brand, driven by premiumisation and rising social acceptance of alcohol. “Since Covid, there’s been a rising social acceptance of beverage alcohol in India, particularly among younger consumers. India is the second-largest whiskey market in the world, growing around 8 per cent annually — a perfect storm for Jack Daniel’s growth.” Firan Technology Group (FTG, C$254.8 billion) The Canadian aerospace and defence electronics firm is setting up a new manufacturing facility in Hyderabad to tap India’s cost advantages and policy support. “We concluded India is a very cost-effective place for manufacturing, with Prime Minister Modi’s Make in India policy and strong aerospace spending making it an ideal place to operate.” Pernod Ricard SA (RI, €21.9 billion) The French spirits major reported steady growth in India despite a sharp excise tax hike in Maharashtra that weighed on demand. “While India continues to enjoy strong consumer demand, the 50 per cent increase in excise tax in Maharashtra led to higher prices and a consequential impact on sales, partly offset by strong growth in Royal Stag and international brands like Jameson.” Published on October 18, 2025 Copyright© 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

The Best Global Brands shows which brands are going up, and which are going down... When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Interbrand has released its annual Best Global Brands ranking and there's very little movement at the top. The top five are Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Samsung in that order, showing that Apple is still... well.... the Apple of many eyes. Other notable brands that rose up through the ranks include Nvidia, Instagram, YouTube, Uber and Netflix. Nvidia had a particularly huge increase (116 per cent), the biggest in the history of the Best Global Brands. There is also the highest number of new entries of any Best Global Brands report, with Uniqlo, Booking.com, Shopify and Blackrock among the newcomers. The reports methodology includes looking at financial analysis, the role of the brand (the portion of the purchase decision attributable to the brand as opposed to other factors) and brand strength, which takes into account brand loyalty. And it's no surprise to us that some of these top brands are also in our best logos list. In the automotive sector, Toyota held on to its number 6 position while Mercedes and BMW also made the top 20 (10 and 14, respectively). In success stories, Ferrari has seen 17 per cent growth (in at 54) while on the flipside, Tesla declined 35 per cent to number 25. Jaguar was nowhere to be seen and hasn't ranked on its own since 2018. I imagine its recent rebrand probably hasn't helped matters. In terms of media and entertainment brands, it was Instagram that stood out as it surged 27 per cent and entered the top 10 for the first time (at number eight). YouTube also saw huge growth, with an increase of 61 per cent to spot number 13 (explore the brand's history with our YouTube logo history). Elsewhere, Netflix surged 42 per cent, and climbed 10 places to number 28. When you think about brands that people use every day for entertainment, neither of these three are a shock. I'm frankly surprised that Netflix wasn't ranked higher. In the world of luxury, Gucci dropped out of the top 50 altogether (to number 69) while Hermés grew 18 per cent (and made it to spot 21) and Chanel managed to cling on to the top 25 at number 24 despite shrinking 8 per cent. Interbrand suggests this may be due to prices post-Covid, which have discouraged some "aspiring middle-class consumers, creating a headwind for the sector". In the world of retail, it was bad news for IKEA and H&M which shrank 9 and 13 per cent, respectively, but good news for Uniqlo, which stormed into the charts at number 47. It must be all those cross-body bags it sold. Interbrand also outlines its Brands to Watch, which shines a light on brands predicted to enter the top 100 in future years. These include Burberry, Canon, KFC, PlayStation, WhatsApp, Zoom and Starbucks. It feels quite amazing that some of those brands aren't on the list already, but I guess there isn't room for everyone.

Investors are plowing money into a broad swath of assets putting the ETF industry in the driver’s seat of what may be another record year. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, overseeing $10 trillion, took a victory lap this week, touting ownership of some of the fastest-growing exchange-traded funds in history. "Our digital assets ETPs and active ETFs have grown from practically zero to 10 in 2023 to over $100 billion in digital assets and over $80 billion in active ETFs. The rapid growth of these premium categories is another proof point of our success in scaling distribution and quickly adapting to new offerings and in new markets," said CEO Larry Fink on the company’s earnings call this week.

This as gold popped to a fresh record high of $4,280.20 an ounce. Another standout, iShares Ethereum ETF -ticker ETHA with assets around $16 billion. AMERICANS FAVOR TRUMP'S $1,000 BABY SAVINGS PLAN "Our flagship offerings in IBIT and ETHA were among the top five inflowing products in the ETP industry," Martin Small, CFO and global head of corporate strategy detailed on the call. Like bitcoin, ethereum has dipped to the $3,800 level from its high of $4,955.23 reached on Aug. 24, 2025. LIVE CRYPTOCURRENCY PRICES: HERE Still, bitcoin and ethereum have each advanced about 14% this year, slightly outperforming the S&P 500’s 13% rise as of Friday.
