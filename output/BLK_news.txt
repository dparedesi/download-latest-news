Title: Real-World Asset Tokenization Hits $24 Billion As Wall Street Bets Big

ByAnastasia Chernikova ByAnastasia Chernikova, Contributor. TOPSHOT - A trader works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) during afternoon trading ... More on April 9, 2025 in New York. Wall Street stocks rocketed to close solidly higher Wednesday, with dramatic advances on all three major indexes as US President Donald Trump delayed steep new tariffs hours after they took effect. The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 7.9 percent to 40,608.45, the broad-based S&P 500 Index rallied 9.5 percent to 5,456.90, and the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index jumped more than 12.2 percent to 17,124.97. (Photo by ANGELA WEISS / AFP) (Photo by ANGELA WEISS/AFP via Getty Images) Major financial institutions are racing to tokenize everything from U.S. Treasuries to real estate, but how long will it last? The tokenization revolution is accelerating at breakneck speed with the Senate just passing the GENIUS Act, providing the first federal framework for digital assets that Wall Street had been waiting for. Over 185 crypto tokens are classified as Real-World Assets (RWAs) with their market capitalization over $10.62 billion, a 61% increase from the previous month, according to Tangem. On top of that, the total market value of tokenized RWAs on public blockchains had surged to nearly $18 billion by early 2025, up from about $10 billion just a year before. This unprecedented growth has been driven by institutional adoption that's finally materializing. BlackRock’s BUIDL fund now holds $2.9 billion in tokenized U.S. Treasuries, making it the world’s largest tokenized asset fund. Franklin Templeton’s BENJI follows at $776 million, while VanEck launched its tokenized RWA fund called VBILL, offering exposure to US Treasury bills across multiple blockchains in partnership with Securitize. “BlackRock tokenized a money market fund on Ethereum. Franklin Templeton is running US government bond funds on public blockchains. JPMorgan just ran a cross chain Delivery versus Payment pilot with Chainlink and Ondo. These are not retail projects. These are the most conservative institutions in finance validating a new model,” Mitchell DiRaimondo, founder at Steelwave Digital, told me in a written response. The current market shows $24 billion in total tokenized assets across 194 issuers, with over 205,000 asset holders, indicating steady growth despite market volatility. Tokenization strips away the friction that has plagued traditional asset management for decades. Settlement times drop from days to minutes, previously illiquid assets like real estate can be traded 24/7, and compliance becomes programmable rather than paper-based. “The biggest risk today is assuming that a legal wrapper and a blockchain alone create value,” Ian Balina, CEO of Token Metrics, told me. "Without real composability, reliable secondary markets, and trusted custody, tokenized assets remain stuck in marketing decks rather than investment portfolios." Ethereum still dominates the tokenized asset landscape, hosting the majority of Real-World Asset value. But emerging Layer 2 solutions are gaining ground as institutions seek faster, cheaper transactions. The infrastructure buildout extends beyond blockchain networks. Zero-knowledge proofs are enabling privacy-preserving compliance, allowing banks to prove asset backing without revealing sensitive financial information. Cross-chain interoperability solutions are connecting fragmented tokenized asset markets. "The introduction of zero-knowledge proofs—which make it possible to securely verify that RWAs are backed by real world assets, without revealing sensitive information—has been a huge catalyst for RWAs," Maxim Legg, CEO of The Pangea Foundation, told me in a written response. "Banks are able to prove that their tokenized funds are backed by real assets, without disclosing sensitive financial information." “It’s a structural evolution in how private credit and fixed income funds operate,” David Robnett, Managing Director of Asset Token Ventures, told me in a written response. “Tokenization solves real-world inefficiencies, such as post-trade friction, tax drag, and illiquidity. That makes growth not just sustainable, but inevitable.” Unlike the speculative crypto cycles of previous years, RWA tokens offer something fundamentally different: real yield backed by real assets. Tokenized Treasury bills currently yield 4-5%, while private credit tokens can offer 8-10% returns—comparable to traditional alternatives but with blockchain’s added benefits. “Unlike the NFT bubble, where speculative JPEGs dominated and predictably lost value, NFT 2.0, AKA Tokenized RWAs, are grounded in utility,” Dan Silverman, CEO at Balcony Technology, told me in an interview. "The RWA is worth what the underlying asset is worth, eliminating the volatility of speculative hype." While stablecoins, tokenized fiat currencies representing over $240 billion of the RWA market, have paved the way, the focus is now shifting to higher-yielding tokenized assets. The GENIUS Act’s framework creates the regulatory foundation for the broader RWA expansion. Here is the sector breakdown: U.S. Treasuries: $6.2 billion (led by BlackRock’s BUIDL at $2.5 billion and Franklin Templeton’s BENJI at $776 million) Private Credit: $12.9 billion (platforms like Centrifuge, Maple, and Apollo's new tokenized fund) Commodities: $1.4 billion (primarily tokenized gold through Tether Gold and Paxos Gold) Real Estate: Growing rapidly, with about $3.8 billion in tokenized properties "Real-World Asset is real and sustainable. It's likely to go in waves," Paul Brody, Global Blockchain Leader at Ernst & Young, told me in an interview. "We are going to move towards a second wave of real-world assets like real estate, physical infrastructure, intellectual property, and more that exist off-chain but could benefit from the automation possible with smart contracts and in the efficiency of on-chain settlement." Regulatory clarity and guidelines for tokenized assets remain critical for their future development. Infrastructure scaling with cross-chain interoperability solutions and institutional-grade custody services are also maturing rapidly. The RWA market is projected to hit a $50 billion market cap by the end of this year. For investors, this represents both opportunity and risk, but the institutional validation is real—BlackRock doesn't deploy billions into experimental technologies. "The promise of RWAs is to deliver the efficiency and immediacy of crypto markets to a wider investor pool," Stuart Popejoy, CEO of Kadena, wrote to me in a response. "We’re not trying to tear down the financial system. We’re upgrading it." The smart money is actively participating, with careful due diligence and risk management. Whether this marks the dawn of a new financial era will depend on execution.

Title: New York Times and Roger Cohen Promote War Again

Time Published: 2025-06-20T11:17:09Z
Full Content:
The NY Times has been a major promoter of US “regime change” operations for decades. Today, while President Trump considers directly involving a US attack on Iran, the NYT is again performing this role despite many readers being skeptical or opposed. A June 19 NYT news/analysis is titled “An Islamic Republic With Its Back Against the Wall” by Roger Cohen. It seems written to pave the way for yet another US-backed or -directed “regime change”. The first sentence asserts without providing evidence that the Tehran government is “an unpopular and repressive regime”. An “Iran expert” is quoted saying, “The Islamic Republic is a rotten tooth waiting to be plucked, like the Soviet Union in its latter years.” . Screenshot from NYT . When Israel bombed the Iranian TV broadcast station as a female news anchor was reading the news, Cohen writes that “Some Iranians were overjoyed”. Cohen uses Netanyahu’s description that Israel’s attacks on Iran are “pre-emptive” and designed to “stop Iran using its enriched uranium to race for a bomb.” He does not mention that even the US intelligence agencies agree that Iran does NOT have a nuclear weapon program. Cohen goes on to quote former BlackRock executive and now German Chancellor, Friedrich Merz: “This mullah regime has brought death and destruction to the world.” Iran has invaded no countries while the US has invaded Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and Syria while Israel has attacked Lebanon, Syria, Gaza, and now Iran. After suggesting some causes for caution, Cohen closes with his core message: the Tehran government may fall like the Berlin Wall. He quotes the “Iran expert” again: “The Islamic Republic is a zombie regime.” Roger Cohen has been an influential participant in NYT distortions and lies. In 2002, he became NYT foreign editor during the crucial run up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. As stated at his Wikipedia page, “He supported the invasion.” The deceit about the non-existent “weapons of mass destruction” was under Cohen’s direction. In early March, 2011, Roger Cohen said he was against Western intervention in Libya. Two weeks later, he urged the West to be “ruthless” and to kill the Libyan leader. This has turned out to be yet another disaster. The Libyan people are still paying the price while Roger Cohen has forgotten about it. Roger Cohen, representative of the Times, consistently finds a few voices of opposition, claims without evidence they represent a large group or the civilian majority, then promotes intervention, violence and “regime change”. He did this with Iraq, then Libya, now Iran. Judging from the most popular reader comments, many NYT readers are critical of this “news analysis”. The most popular comment has 1,600 endorsements. Dr. Finn Majlergaard from France says, “What right do you (Americans) think you have to decide who should be in power in sovereign countries when you can’t even deal with your own domestic dictator and the US regime’s gestapo methods against foreigners?” The second most popular comment is from Florence Massachussetts. The reader asks, “Will it be okay if a truly democratic nation bombs the United States in order to encourage regime change away from our current authoritarian rulers?” The vast majority of reader comments are critical of the drive to attack and possibly overthrow yet another government. Apparently they have learned from past foreign policy failures while the NY Times and foreign policy establishment have not. Another disaster based on false assumptions and arrogance lays ahead. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article. Follow us on Instagram and X and subscribe to our Telegram Channel.

Governments can make that happen by erecting barriers that keep foreign goods out or make them more expensive. That protects domestic industries and domestic workers, but at the expense of domestic consumers (and global welfare). That’s a tradeoff – the kind of thing free markets require and leaders who would mandate economic outcomes would prefer to ignore.

Title: WE ARE BEING AMUSED AND ABUSED TO DEATH

Editor Empire Jim Quinn, The Burning Platform “But we had forgotten that alongside Orwell’s dark vision, there was another—slightly older, slightly less well known, equally chilling: Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World. Contrary to common belief even among the educated, Huxley and Orwell did not prophesy the same thing. Orwell warns that we will be overcome by an externally imposed oppression. But in Huxley’s vision, no Big Brother is required to deprive people of their autonomy, maturity and history. As he saw it, people will come to love their oppression, to adore the technologies that undo their capacities to think.” – Neil Postman – Amusing Ourselves to Death “What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one. Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egoism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture, preoccupied with some equivalent of the feelies, the orgy porgy, and the centrifugal bumblepuppy.” – Neil Postman – Amusing Ourselves to Death I find myself ruminating about whether there is anything myself or any other average Joe can do to make a difference in this world, controlled by psychopaths, satanists, egomaniacal billionaires, corrupt evil politicians, a cabal of greedy financiers, neocon warmongering globalists, and the propaganda entertainment complex. When a complex entity becomes too large, it becomes inefficient, bureaucratic, corrupt, and uncontrollable. The corruption, waste, and purposeful use of governmental power to enrich politicians and their billionaire benefactors, to the detriment of the country and the average citizen, has grown to an incomprehensible and uncontainable level. Whether DOGE was a legitimate undertaking by Musk and his tech geniuses to cut wasteful spending and uncover fraud, or nothing more than a PR stunt designed to keep the MAGA army satiated with the appearance of making America great again, it appears to have sunk into the swamps of DC, foiled by the uni-party once again. But the show must go on, and this past week’s episode of “As the Empire Crumbles” was certainly entertaining, with the most powerful politician in the world hurling insults at the richest man in the world, who responded by accusing the president of pedophilia, while calling for his impeachment and the creation of a new political party. The MAGA acolytes were flabbergasted, as their two heroes, who were going to usher in a new golden era, came to blows and have irreconcilably broken up. Who could have predicted that the two biggest egos on the planet would ultimately clash and dissolve their partnership? Many of the twitterati were convinced it was just more 4D chess, just as they believed the Q bullshit during Trump’s first term. The world was captivated and enthralled by this trivial social media war, while NATO/Ukraine desperately attempted to initiate WW3 with their attacks on Russian airbases, the Crimean bridge, and Russian passenger trains. Thousands of tweets and hundreds of articles have been written about this Trump/Musk bickerfest, while the world is imploding and we are accelerating headlong towards a global war, initiated by the three stooges running France, U.K. and Germany, and cheered on by the likes of Lindsey Graham and Mike Pompeo. Trump’s campaign trail promise to end the Ukraine war in 24 hours has proven to be nothing more than his predictable bloviating bullshit. It has become clear he has absolutely no sway over the EU warmongers, or his own Deep State CIA operatives carrying out the attacks on Russia, as his weak and ineffectual efforts to end the conflict start to diminish his presidency from the outset. The Gaza genocide continues, with American financial and military support, even though Trump promised to end that conflict. Iran continues to resist efforts to stop its nuclear enrichment program. China pretends to be negotiating with Trump on tariffs but is content letting the Soros installed leftist judges across the country place roadblock after roadblock in the way of Trump’s tariff, deportation, and governmental downsizing agenda. Foreign leaders know they can wait out all of Trump’s threats by just slow walking negotiations and hoping the Republicans lose the House in 2026. China is biding its time until they believe America is sufficiently preoccupied with its own domestic turmoil and its Ukraine quagmire, and they will initiate their inevitable Taiwan takeover. The United States has not won a war in 80 years and is in no position to wage war in Europe and Asia simultaneously. Trump professes to be for peace, but the Deep State actors controlling the government and the globalist billionaires pulling the strings will force him into WW3. That is how Fourth Turnings roll. With the intense opposition to the Big Beautiful Bill from Musk and key Republicans in the Senate, the next few months could get messy on the fiscal front. Musk is entirely correct, calling the BBB a massive, outrageous, pork-filled disgusting abomination of congressional pork. When the mind numbingly stupid media outlets declare it will add $3 trillion to the national debt over ten years, that means $3 trillion more than the $21 trillion of additional debt already projected. And this assumes no recessions, no financial crisis, no wars, and no fake pandemics. They purposefully give the impression our national debt only goes up by $3 trillion over ten years. I’m absolutely certain the average prole, distracted by their technological bread and circuses, has no clue our debt is on automatic pilot to increase by nearly 70% over the next ten years. The average person remains trapped in a false comfort zone, designed by their overlords, to keep them satiated with toxic foodstuff, propaganda disguised as entertainment, and believing going deeper and deeper into debt, buying trinkets and baubles makes them wealthy. Until that comfort zone is shattered by the bitter reality of the next financial implosion, the masses will do nothing to try and alter the disastrous course plotted by their overlords. The GOP passage of $9.4 billion of DOGE cuts is nothing more than a PR stunt to convince the ignorant masses they are actually doing something about the deficit. The dopes making bets on Draft Kings and posting videos on Instagram have no concept about how ridiculously out of control our government has become. They add $6 billion to the national debt every single day, so their $9.4 of “cuts” will be gone in 37 hours. Our deficits are big, but they are not beautiful. Our deficit in FY24 was $1.8 trillion. Through the first 7 months of FY25 the deficit is $1.049 trillion. At the current rate of spending, the deficit will be $2.2 trillion by the end of the fiscal year. Interest on the national debt is now the second biggest expenditure and has gone from $500 billion during Trump’s first term to $1.3 trillion today. These deficits are clearly unsustainable, and anything which is unsustainable will not be sustained. But the corrupt, captured politicians and insatiably avaricious Wall Street bankers will keep dancing until the music stops. Then they will use their next engineered financial crisis to take more of our money and further restrict our liberties and freedom. CBDCs and social credit scores anyone? The real reason Trump and the GOP need to pass the big beautiful, bloated pig of a bill is because our Ponzi scheme economy depends upon the never-ending issuance of trillions in debt every year to give the fabricated appearance of stability. This is why the GOP applauds Musk’s low hanging fruit DOGE cost savings and ignores them in their outrageously corpulent budget bill. The truth is any actual reduction in government spending (36% of GDP) would ripple through an economy entirely dependent upon government largess and immediately create a massive recession and probable depression. Ponzi schemes have to keep growing until they run out of suckers believing the bullshit underlying the Ponzi. This is where those controlling the levers of society (Bernays’ invisible government) utilize their limitless well of propaganda techniques, technological distractions, and mindless entertainment venues to keep the ignorant masses amused, delusional, and living in denial of the reality staring them in the face. Since the 2008 financial crisis we have been muddling through economically at a 10,000 feet macro level, with periodic crisis episodes (housing collapse, fake pandemic) utilized by the powers that be to issue trillions more debt as the antidote to the initial crisis created by too much debt. At a micro level, the average American has seen a significant decline in their standard of living, as official government reported inflation has eroded 40% of their purchasing power, when in reality they have lost more than 60% of their purchasing power. The reality for the average American prole is debt slavery, either self-imposed to keep up with the Joneses or forced upon them to survive this globalist-imposed death by a thousand cuts economy. Credit card debt of $1.3 trillion is at an all-time high, up $350 billion (35%) since 2020. The average balance on those credit cards is over $7,000 and the average interest rate on those unpaid balances is over 21%. Student loan debt of $1.8 trillion is at an all-time high, up $100 billion since 2020, with over 25% of these loans in default. Auto loan debt of $1.7 trillion is at an all-time high, up $350 billion (27%) since 2020. The average length of these loans is now 70 months. The borrower is underwater by the fifth year of these loans. Shockingly, credit card and auto loan delinquencies have been soaring in the last year, with credit card delinquencies above 3% for the first time since 2012, and auto loan delinquencies surpassed 8% for the first time since 2010. Does that sound like a consumer on solid ground? In addition, the housing market is a disaster looking for a trigger. The Wall Street hedge funds (Blackrock) bought up millions of homes, driving prices 140% (Case Siller Index) higher than the 2012 low, while outstanding mortgage debt has risen from the 2012 low of $13 trillion to $21 trillion today. Prices are ridiculously high and mortgage rates of 7% make it virtually impossible for an average working stiff to buy even a small home. The market is frozen. This is why Trump and his GOP minions must avoid a recession at all costs by continuing to rack up $2 trillion annual deficits. A recession would result in millions of layoffs, which would mean unpaid mortgages, which would mean foreclosures and slashing of home prices, which would trigger housing collapse 2.0, which would turn the recession into a depression, causing a stock market collapse. Now you know why they are desperate to pass this big, beautiful behemoth of bilge. The Fed is in a precarious position of their own making, with all choices pointing towards disastrous outcomes. They are already sitting on over $1 trillion of unrealized bond losses, while their Wall Street owners sit on another $400 billion of unrealized bond losses. If these entities ever have to realize those losses, our entire banking system would collapse. The Fed has cut rates by 1%, but market rates went up, as their power to mislead market players diminishes. They have reduced their balance sheet from $9 trillion to $6.7 trillion. The last time they tried to reduce their balance sheet in 2019, the repo market spasmed and they used the Covid cover to drastically print more fiat. Trump is mocking Powell and demanding interest rate cuts. Powell is pretending to be independent, but he is praying for some kind of crisis to again set the printing presses to hyper-speed. I’m sure the ruling oligarchs are hatching a new crisis to expand their wealth, power, and control, while further impoverishing and enslaving the plebs. It is clear at least to me, we stand on the precipice of an economic conflagration capable of putting the final nail in the coffin of this empire of debt. At the same time there are unrelenting evil forces who are frantically creating the casus-belli to initiate World War III and the massive death and destruction that would produce. The simultaneous commencement of these two events would produce the type of climax expected in the waning years of a Fourth Turning, with a final resolution expected by 2032. Most people are blissfully unaware of the imminent demise of their comfortable existence, so addicted to their techno-gadgets and mindless social media performance art, they are incapable of critical thought regarding the dystopian world they inhabit. “People will come to adore the technologies that undo their capacities to think” ― Neil Postman – Amusing Ourselves to Death “If politics is like show business, then the idea is not to pursue excellence, clarity or honesty but to appear as if you are, which is another matter altogether.” ― Neil Postman – Amusing Ourselves to Death If you ever needed proof politics is nothing but show business, it is this big, beautiful bill episode of drama, fiction, comedy, and tragedy. Excellence, clarity, and honesty have no part in this absurd psychodrama of lies, accusations, and continued downward spiral of this empire of debt. We know Huxley believed the masses could be sufficiently distracted by their own ego driven pursuits, but I don’t think even he realized how much power the technological “advances” of our times (TV based mass media, the internet, corporate/government controlled social media, Big Pharma) would be used by the ruling elite to control, manipulate, sedate, and scare the ignorant masses into voluntary subservience. Everything we are witnessing and living through is nothing more than a theater production, designed by Bernays’ invisible governing authorities to herd us towards their technological gulag, with the slaughterhouse as the other alternative. Huxley’s 1932 dystopian vision, which he believed was more likely than Orwell’s 1949 dystopian vision of the future, and reinforced in a letter to Orwell in 1949 shortly before his death, has been the pre-dominant method used by our overlords to rule over, manipulate, and exploit the foibles of the unthinking masses. They have kept their citizens distracted with pleasures, drugged into passivity, taught to feel rather than think in government run indoctrination centers (public schools) and overloaded with so much useless trivial information, they are incapable of distinguishing between good and evil – actually believing their servitude is freedom. While Huxley’s dystopia continues, the ruling class fears their passive mind control methods aren’t as effective in achieving their great reset agenda, and in need of some Orwellian censorship, disinformation, brute force, government intimidation, harsh mind control, and guaranteeing compliance through fear. Aren’t we lucky to be experiencing the best of both dystopian visions. Those controlling the levers of society have used the school system to create a soulless amalgamation of hedonistic mass consumers; purposeless, apathetic, with muddled brains unable to understand their unintended enslavement to the evil demons running our world and controlling their lives. Knowing most of what we see on our screens and hear from supposed “experts”, left wing corporate media talking heads, and Fox News bimbos, is gibberish and propaganda, it is hard to distinguish real threats from clickbait, purposeful disinformation, and scare tactics designed to make you do what they want you to do. The precarious financial situation of the country is real. The danger from an AI cage built through a tech-state merger with Palantir to surveil and digitally profile everyone is real. The threat of the Ukraine-Russia conflict morphing into WW3 is real. The desire by billionaire globalists to introduce a Great Reset, Great Taking, and CBDCs is real. The planned, funded, and executed invasion of our southern border during the Basement Dummy administration by third world dregs, with the sole intention of destroying the social fabric and finances of the country, run by the Soros/Clinton/Obama triumvirate is real. Even with the dismantling of their USAID insurrection funding source, this week’s festivities in Los Angeles kicked off the summer of civil war. There is nothing real or spontaneous about these riots. Whenever pallets of bricks suddenly show up on streets in city centers, you know Soros and his ilk are behind the organized destruction of that particular city. The brick and bomb throwers are being paid to riot and take photo ops. This will assuredly be rolled out in our other Democrat controlled urban shitholes across the land. The governor of California and the communist mayor of Los Angeles are paid acolytes of Soros, stoking insurrection and should be arrested and thrown into the dungeons of DC, like the grandmothers and patriots who sauntered through the Capitol on January 6. We find ourselves on the precipice of a financial, social, and military calamity, all driven by the three driving forces of this Fourth Turning: debt, civic decay, global disorder. Anyone not noticing events are intensifying, conflict is expanding, anger is building, and the world is accelerating towards that precipice at breakneck speed, is simply ignorant or their minds are so numbed by their i-gadgets and government school indoctrination, that it’s beyond their comprehension to acknowledge reality. At this point in history, I do not believe there are enough awakened critical thinking citizens to make a difference during the waning years of this Fourth Turning. We can’t vote our way out. We likely can’t shoot our way out. We can’t buy our way out. When the majority are proud of their ignorance and believe it is superior to actual knowledge, your society is pretty much screwed. “What is happening here is that television is altering the meaning of ‘being informed’ by creating a species of information that might properly be called disinformation. I am using this world almost in the precise sense in which it is used by spies in the CIA or KGB. Disinformation does not mean false information. It means misleading information–misplace, irrelevant, fragmented or superficial information – information that creates the illusion of knowing something but which in fact leads one away from knowing. I am saying something far more serious than that we are being deprived of authentic information. I am saying we are losing our sense of what it means to be well informed. Ignorance is always correctable. But what shall we do if we take ignorance to be knowledge?” ― Neil Postman – Amusing Ourselves to Death The existing financial, social and political paradigms will have to collapse and be swept away for any real change to occur. The problem is it appears that is exactly what the billionaire globalist elite are trying to trigger. In the aftermath, amidst chaos, financial ruin, civil and global war, social strife, and a political vacuum, they envision establishing an authoritarian global world order, with CBDCs, social credit scores, 15-minute cities, and Big Brother level surveillance. If this vision prevails, Orwell wins the award over Huxley for the most accurate dystopian nightmare. Our only hope resides in the hubris and arrogance of the ruling class. Once the collapse is underway, its course is unpredictable and unstable. The best laid plans have a way of going awry. This could offer an opportunity for normal rational people to make their stand. If a liberty movement, backed by the 300 million firearms residing in the red states, could re-ignite the brush fires of freedom in the minds of men, maybe we could reset the course of our country. The odds probably aren’t worse than they were in 1776. At this point, all we can do is prepare mentally, physically, and spiritually for the coming storm. Buy supplies, guns and ammo. And remember what your forefathers accomplished with far less. The choice is slavery or freedom. “It does not take a majority to prevail … but rather an irate, tireless minority, keen on setting brushfires of freedom in the minds of men.” ― Samuel Adams “The time is near at hand which must determine whether Americans are to be free men or slaves.” – George Washington Support the Truth: SEMI-ANNUAL TBP BEG-A-THON Empire Empire Empire Receive the latest and greatest by subscribing to our newsletter

Title: US Banks That Fueled Ireland’s Finance Rebound Face Tariff Angst

(Bloomberg) -- When the US launched sweeping tariffs against trade partners in April, BlackRock Inc. Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink found himself in Ireland, one of the countries with most to lose if US multinationals were forced to curtail their operations overseas. Fink, whose company was in the running for a major contract with the Irish government at the time, toed a careful line, claiming to “understand the logic” of Donald Trump’s move while not agreeing with it, and insisting there “does not need to be a true trade war.” Almost three months on, the Wall Street giants that created thousands of Dublin jobs since Brexit are in a similarly awkward position. They’re trying to balance the challenges created by their own government with the opportunities in a country that depends on US multinationals for more than 10% of its jobs and a big chunk of tax receipts. For now, the banks are hopeful their multinational clients will adapt to the trade uncertainty. “It’s not obvious to me that that falls off a cliff” under the threat of tariffs, says Marc Hussey, the Irish-born JPMorgan Chase & Co. executive who returned home to run the bank’s 1,500-strong Dublin business in 2022. Assuming multinationals “shrink overnight” would be an “extreme view,” Hussey added, and he is “not sensing that from any of our clients.” He continues to see growth in the range of businesses he oversees including a global funds administration center, a workplace solutions business that runs employment share programs across the world and the EMEA hub for Chase payments technology. Ireland remains popular in JPMorgan’s head office too — CEO Jamie Dimon will travel to Dublin next month to speak at an event, his fourth such trip in six years. Almost a decade on from the UK’s Brexit vote that cut off London’s banks from a several markets inside the European Union, Ireland has become a big draw for foreign lenders. They now employ close to 15,000 people, according to a report from the Federation of International Banks in Ireland last month, with firms including JPMorgan, Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp. leading the way to set up major EU businesses in the country. That choice puts them at the eye of the tariffs storm in a market that has long been heavily exposed to US multinationals, prompting recent warnings about the outlook for the economy and the risk to financial stability. As part of the EU, Ireland’s fate is tied to negotiations with Trump ahead of a July 9 deadline, after which nearly all of the bloc’s imports to the US will be hit with a 50% levy. Across the River Liffey from JPMorgan’s offices, Citi’s 2,900 staff are working across an innovation hub, the group’s EU bank headquarters and an international corporate banking businesses. Citi CEO Jane Fraser was in town a few weeks ago to mark the bank’s 60th anniversary in the nation, and hailed Ireland as “a hub for innovation, a magnet for multinationals and a vital part of the world’s economic landscape.” The bank’s new Dublin office, to be opened next year with space for an extra 400 staff, is “a symbol of our long-term investment in Ireland and in Europe,” she added in a LinkedIn post. Hussey is hoping the move increases the chances of a long-promised footbridge that would link JPMorgan on Dublin’s southside to the northside of the Liffey, where Citi’s new office will join the Central Bank of Ireland’s headquarters. Davinia Conlan, Citi’s Ireland head and chair of industry group FIBI, argues that there is “a lot to be positive about from an Ireland domestic economy perspective” and she is hopeful that Citi will ultimately fill its 3,300 capacity in the new site, though she’s not putting any time line on that. “We’re still expecting the economy to, to grow albeit at a slower pace than we would’ve seen previously,” she said. Wish List Ireland also offers companies the benefit of “ease of access” to government, Conlan said. The Department of Finance will soon launch an industry consultation on its next international financial services strategy, a successor to the Ireland for Finance strategy launched in 2020 which covers banks, insurers, funds and other firms that combined employ around 60,000. Regulatory simplification will be high on the industry’s wish list, Conlan and her peers say, with firms set to call on Ireland to remove some “gold-plating” of EU rules and to push the bloc to be more competitive around regulation. The international banks’ federation, FIBI, is preparing a proposal on simplification which will offer examples of areas where regulation can be “more efficient,” Conlan said, declining to offer goldplating examples before that. Investments in infrastructure and housing, including a long promised airport metro, will also be on the list. Fernando Vicario, who heads Bank of America’s Dublin-based EU head office, is hopeful that imminent reform of the EU’s securitization market will offer a further boost for his 1,300-strong team, which has been retaining its earnings to support future growth. “Ireland can be a place where these securitization deals can be packaged out of Ireland into the rest of Europe,” he said, adding that the country already commands a big presence in this market. Vicario does not expect the Irish government to pivot to protectionist sentiment, which has cropped up in some countries in response to Trump’s trade approach. “I learned in Boston that America is Irish,” says Vicario. “In business, people stick to their positions and do business. And we do business with Irish headquartered companies and with Irish branches and subsidiaries of US companies, all day long. I have quite frankly no problem whatsoever with our passport referring to our US origin.” Ireland has shown it has no problems with US companies either: following Fink’s careful diplomacy, BlackRock was last month named a preferred bidder to help manage the country’s multibillion-euro pension program. --With assistance from Leonard Kehnscherper.

Title: Health Ranger Report: The HIDDEN AGENDAS behind the Israel-Palestine conflict

David Sorensen claims Israel's true purpose is to establish Jerusalem as the center of a one-world government, orchestrated by Zionist elites in powerful institutions like BlackRock, Vanguard and global health organizations. Sorensen alleges Israel intentionally fostered Hamas to justify military expansion, citing Netanyahu's 2019 remarks and suspicious IDF security failures during the October 7 attack as evidence of a staged provocation. He traces Israel's origins to the Rothschild family, accusing them of satanic motives symbolized by occult imagery (e.g., the City of London's dragon crest) and hijacking Christianity to serve political Zionism. Sorensen condemns Christian Zionism as a distortion of scripture, arguing that true Israel is spiritual â not a militarized state. He blames elite-funded doctrines (e.g., Scofield Study Bible) for misleading believers. Despite exposing conflict as manufactured, Sorensen envisions Israeli-Palestinian reconciliation and plans a follow-up documentary. His core message urges unity over violence, encouraging resistance against artificial divisions. The Health Ranger Mike Adams sat down withÂ David Sorensen, a missionary journalist and filmmaker behind the documentary "The Mystery of Israel," on the Health Ranger Report. Their conversation delved intoÂ the hidden agendas behind the Israel-Palestine conflict. Sorensen began by elaboratingÂ a globalist plot to establish Jerusalem as the center of a one-world government.Â The founder ofÂ StopWorldControl.comÂ argues that Israel's geopolitical significance extends far beyond its small geographic footprint. He claims that Zionist elites are orchestrating a plan to centralize control in Jerusalem. Many of these elites helm powerful institutions like BlackRock, Vanguard and global health organizations. "The vast majority of people haven't got the slightest clue about the real agenda with Israel â that it's all about establishing a one-world government from within Jerusalem,"Â Sorensen stated. He emphasized that mainstream narratives suppress this truth, labeling dissenters as "antisemitic" to silence criticism. One of the most explosive claims in Sorensen's documentary is that the Palestinian military group Hamas (formally theÂ Islamic Resistance Movement) was deliberately fostered by Israel to justify military expansion. He cited statements from Israeli officials, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. "Anyone who wants to thwart the establishment of a Palestinian state has to support bolstering Hamas and transferring money to Hamas," the incumbent Israeli leader allegedly said in 2019. "This is part of our strategy." Sorensen also referenced whistleblowers from the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) who claim that Israel's advanced border security systems inexplicably failed during Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attack. This raises suspicions of a staged provocation, with the missionary journalist arguing that no military commander in his right mind would carry out such an irrational suicide mission â unless they knew retaliation was part of a larger plan. Israel's Rothschild connection and the role of satanic influence Sorensen traced Israel's origins to the Rothschild family, whom he accused of funding the state's creation as part of a satanic agenda. He pointed to the City of London's crest â featuring two dragons â as symbolic of their allegiance to dark forces. (Related:Â The history of the House ofÂ Rothschild.) "They don't even hide their Satanism,"Â he said, referencing biblical descriptions of the dragon as Satan.Â "The Rothschilds are known to be at the heads of Satanism. They are a very satanic family." A significant portion of the interview focused on Christian Zionism â a movement that unconditionally supports Israel based on theological interpretations. Sorensen added that they have hijacked Christianity to turn believers away from Christ and toward a political, militarized Israel. The filmmaker condemned this ideology as a distortion of scriptureÂ â arguing that true Israel is spiritual, not political as God never promised a military state. Christ fulfilled all prophecies, and His kingdom is within each individual. Sorensen blamed the elite-funded Scofield Study Bible for twisting Christian doctrine to justify Zionist expansion. Despite the grim revelations, Sorensen ended on a hopeful note, sharing a vision of reconciliation between Israelis and Palestinians. The author and filmmaker mentioned that in a dream, he saw both groups realizing they were the same people who were guilty and needing the forgiveness of God. He added that instead of fighting, they embraced each other which is the message the world needs. Head over to Truth.news for more similar stories.

"Anyone who wants to thwart the establishment of a Palestinian state has to support bolstering Hamas and transferring money to Hamas," the incumbent Israeli leader allegedly said in 2019. "This is part of our strategy." Sorensen also referenced whistleblowers from the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) who claim that Israel's advanced border security systems inexplicably failed during Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attack. This raises suspicions of a staged provocation, with the missionary journalist arguing that no military commander in his right mind would carry out such an irrational suicide mission â unless they knew retaliation was part of a larger plan. Israel's Rothschild connection and the role of satanic influence Sorensen traced Israel's origins to the Rothschild family, whom he accused of funding the state's creation as part of a satanic agenda. He pointed to the City of London's crest â featuring two dragons â as symbolic of their allegiance to dark forces. (Related:Â The history of the House ofÂ Rothschild.) "They don't even hide their Satanism,"Â he said, referencing biblical descriptions of the dragon as Satan.Â "The Rothschilds are known to be at the heads of Satanism. They are a very satanic family." A significant portion of the interview focused on Christian Zionism â a movement that unconditionally supports Israel based on theological interpretations. Sorensen added that they have hijacked Christianity to turn believers away from Christ and toward a political, militarized Israel. The filmmaker condemned this ideology as a distortion of scriptureÂ â arguing that true Israel is spiritual, not political as God never promised a military state. Christ fulfilled all prophecies, and His kingdom is within each individual. Sorensen blamed the elite-funded Scofield Study Bible for twisting Christian doctrine to justify Zionist expansion. Despite the grim revelations, Sorensen ended on a hopeful note, sharing a vision of reconciliation between Israelis and Palestinians. The author and filmmaker mentioned that in a dream, he saw both groups realizing they were the same people who were guilty and needing the forgiveness of God. He added that instead of fighting, they embraced each other which is the message the world needs. Head over to Truth.news for more similar stories.

Title: Could a nuclear war kill crypto? AI predicts Bitcoin’s fate in doomsday scenario
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/could-a-nuclear-war-kill-crypto-ai-predicts-bitcoins-fate-in-doomsday-scenario/

Polymarket odds of a nuclear bomb being dropped in 2025 was 18% – But can BTC survive? Bitcoin [BTC] has a religious following, especially for those who believe it’s a hedge against inflation and political instability, like the ongoing Israel-Iran war. But, what if it cracks in a nuclear doomsday? Many wealthy individuals, like Mexico’s richest man, Ricardo Salinas, and leaders like U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance, have embraced BTC and crypto as a hedge. In fact, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, pitches BTC as a hedge equivalent or better than gold. However, AI predicts that the digital gold may not survive a nuclear apocalypse. For starters, it is crucial to understand the Bitcoin network, miners who secure it, and nodes that run the protocol to ensure transaction reliability. As of mid-2025, the network has 22,129 reachable nodes (including mining nodes) spread across the globe. Source: NewHedge According to public and official data, the U.S. controls 10.2% of BTC nodes, followed by Germany (5.8%) and France (2.6%). All the top three are nuclear powers, while China, per official data, owns only 0.15%. However, nearly 64% of nodes remained unaccounted for or unknown. Per ChatGPT, China may be controlling most of these ‘unknown’ nodes, as most of their operators opted for VPNs and went underground after the state banned BTC mining in 2021. Source: ChatGPT In a major conflict wiping out 60-80% of the internet, Bitcoin active nodes could drop from the current 22K to 1K, leading to transaction failure, alongside the proof of work (PoW) consensus. Most of the U.S. and Germany nodes would be offline for an average war, like between Russia and NATO, per ChatGPT predictions. But P2P connections could be resumed in weeks. However, a worldwide nuclear escalation would drive the network into a ‘critical failure state’, and the consensus program would stop. The above war scales and impact on the Bitcoin network would impact BTC’s value differently. But ChatGPT added that BTC pricing will be modified by other factors like market psychology and sentiment. Source: ChatGPT For a confined conflict, BTC could be viewed as a hedge, like the current Israel-Iran war. It has stayed above $100K despite the war rhetoric from leaders, including the U.S. President Donald Trump. In fact, Bitwise’s Head of Alpha Strategies reinforced this stance and recently stated, “This moment (geopolitical tensions) is why Bitcoin exists.” Meanwhile, other analysts, like QCP Capital, warned that a wider regional war could affect oil supply and global inflation, putting BTC at risk. According to ChatGPT, however, such a regional scale, involving nuclear warheads, would lead to price swings with mixed sentiment. However, in a global and total annihilation scenario, food and barter trade will be more valuable, and the internet and BTC will be dead. This is how ChatGPT charted out the above probabilities on the potential price crash for BTC. Source: ChatGPT For a localized attack, the network would remain steady, and the price could dip about 10%-30%. In fact, this is considered a normal pullback during bull markets. Per current prices, that would imply a drop to $98K-$75K. For a regional nuclear war, BTC price would crash 30%-60%, implying a potential dip to $75K-$42K as most nodes go offline. In continent-wide destruction (2-3 powers annihilated), ChatGPT projected a 60-80% decline. That would be a free fall to $42K-20K. This could be a great discount for survivors if Bitcoin survives and rallies above $100K. However, only 1000 nodes could be online, risking a protocol split or fork. But, as a survivor with no internet access, you’ll likely care about food and shelter if the entire world is nuked. In short, BTC would cease to exist as a market asset and probably tank to zero. Overall, BTC could become worthless if nukes destroy the internet and nodes. But ChatGPT highlighted that it could survive only if there is a backup in satellites with enough running nodes to keep it decentralized and secure before full re-connection later on. That said, as of June 2025, there was only an 18% chance of a nuclear bomb going off in 2025. So, it could be too early to put your nuclear war worries on BTC.

Title: Trump Is ‘Flouting the Law’ in Delaying Enforcement of TikTok Ban, Top Senate Democrat Says
URL: https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/trump-flouting-law-tiktok-ban-delay-executive-order-1236436409/
Time Published: 2025-06-20T02:12:56Z

By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor President Trump on Thursday officially issued his third executive order delaying enforcement of a law that effectively bans TikTok in the U.S. unless its Chinese parent company sells a controlling stake to non-Chinese parties. Democrats said Trump’s action does not have any legal basis. Sen. Mark Warner (D-Virginia), vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said in a statement after the White House said the president would delay enforcing the TikTok divest-or-ban law: “Once again, the Trump administration is flouting the law and ignoring its own national security findings about the risks posed by a PRC-controlled TikTok,” referring to the People’s Republic of China. Related Stories Vincent Cassel to Star in Netflix's Next Big French Movie, 'Quasimodo,' Directed by 'Mesrine' Helmer, Produced by Mediawan's Radar Films Warner continued, “An executive order can’t sidestep the law, but that’s exactly what the president is trying to do.” Popular on Variety Republicans aren’t pleased with Trump’s continuing delays on the TikTok law, either. “That’s not my favorite thing,” Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Missouri) told Axios about Trump’s planned extension in a story published Thursday. “I’m fine with him trying to sell it, that’s fine, but I think at a certain point we’ve got to enforce this law.” Trump on Thursday wrote on Truth Social, “I’ve just signed the Executive Order extending the Deadline for the TikTok closing for 90 days (September 17, 2025). Thank you for your attention to this matter!” The White House had previously said he would issue such an order. Trump, in the final months of his first administration, tried unsuccessfully to ban TikTok unless its ownership was transferred to U.S. companies. But after the 2024 election Trump said “I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok,” because “there are those who say” the app helped drive support for him among young voters. The Trump administration has been trying to hammer out a deal that would restructure TikTok U.S.’s operations in a way that would comply with the law — while also being an arrangement the Chinese government will approve. On Thursday, Rep. Brad Sherman (D-California) criticized Trump’s latest delay on the TikTok ban, writing in a post on X, “The law allows only one single extension, so Trump’s failure to enforce it is illegal.” However, in the same post, Sherman incorrectly claimed that “the Chinese owners of TikToK have announced they are buying ‘Trump Coins’ for $300 million,” which he alleged “is just a $300 million bribe that goes right into his pocket.” The official TikTok Policy account on X called out Sherman’s claim as “patently false and irresponsible.” According to a New York Times story published May 13, a company called GD Culture Group, a “struggling technology company that has ties to China and relies on TikTok,” announced that it secured funding “to buy as much as $300 million of $TRUMP, the so-called memecoin marketed by President Trump.” On a post Thursday on X from @TrumpWarRoom (described as “The official War Room account of President Donald J. Trump’s political operation”) about Trump’s latest deferment of enforcing the ban, users added a Community Note (a crowdsourced fact-checking feature of X) pointing out that the president “has no legal authority to extend the deadline another 90 days.” The Community Note cited the Supreme Court’s ruling in TikTok Inc. v. Garland upholding the law, which says: “The Act permits the President to grant a one-time extension of no more than 90 days with respect to the prohibitions’ 270-day effective date.” Under a U.S. law that went into effect Jan. 19, 2025, it is illegal for American companies to host or distribute TikTok in the country as long as it remains controlled by China-based ByteDance. The legislation passed last year with overwhelming bipartisan support, on fears that the popular video entertainment app’s ties to China‘s communist regime make it a national security risk. TikTok said in a statement Thursday, “We are grateful for President Trump’s leadership and support in ensuring that TikTok continues to be available for more than 170 million American users and 7.5 million U.S. businesses that rely on the platform as we continue to work with Vice President Vance’s Office.” Warner, in advocating for passage of the TikTok divest-or-ban bill in the Senate in April 2024, said the legislation “goes a long way towards safeguarding our democratic systems from covert foreign influence.” He said Chinese companies like ByteDance “don’t owe their obligation to their customers, or their shareholders, but they owe it to the PRC government.” At a congressional hearing in March 2023, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew said, “ByteDance is not owned or controlled by the Chinese government” and said there is an “inaccurate belief that TikTok’s corporate structure makes it beholden to the Chinese government or that it shares information about U.S. users with the Chinese government. This is emphatically untrue.” ByteDance has said 60% of its ownership is represented by global institutional investors including BlackRock, General Atlantic and Susquehanna, with 20% owned by its Chinese founders and 20% by employees including those in the U.S. A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment

The technology may be challenging to master and expensive to build today, but fusion promises to harness the nuclear reaction that powers the sun to generate nearly limitless energy here on Earth. If startups are able to complete commercially viable fusion power plants, then they have the potential to upend trillion-dollar markets. The bullish wave buoying the fusion industry has been driven by three advances: more powerful computer chips, more sophisticated AI, and powerful high-temperature superconducting magnets. Together, they have helped deliver more sophisticated reactor designs, better simulations, and more complex control schemes. It doesn’t hurt that, at the end of 2022, a U.S. Department of Energy lab announced that it had produced a controlled fusion reaction that produced more power than the lasers had imparted to the fuel pellet. The experiment had crossed what’s known as scientific breakeven, and while it’s still a long ways from commercial breakeven, where the reaction produces more than the entire facility consumes, it was a long-awaited step that proved the underlying science was sound. Founders have built on that momentum in recent years, pushing the private fusion industry forward at a rapid pace. With a $1.8 billion Series B, Commonwealth Fusion Systems catapulted itself into the pole position in 2021. Since then, the company has been quiet on the fundraising front (no surprise), but it has been hard at work in Massachusetts building Sparc, its first-of-a-kind power plant intended to produce power at what it calls “commercially relevant” levels. Sparc’s reactor uses a tokamak design, which resembles a doughnut. The D-shaped cross section is wound with high-temperature superconducting tape, which when energized, generates a powerful magnetic field that will contain and compress the superheated plasma. In Sparc’s successor, the commercial-scale Arc, heat generated from the reaction is converted to steam to power a turbine. CFS designed its magnets in collaboration with MIT, where co-founder and CEO Bob Mumgaard worked as a researcher on fusion reactor designs and high-temperature superconductors. Backed by Breakthrough Energy Ventures, The Engine, Bill Gates, and others, Devens, Massachusetts-based CFS expects to have Arc operational in the early 2030s. The company has raised a total of $2 billion, according to PitchBook. Founded in 1998, TAE Technologies (formerly known as Tri Alpha Energy) was spun out of the University of California, Irvine by Norman Rostoker. It uses a field-reversed configuration, but with a twist: after the two plasma shots collide in the middle of the reactor, the company bombards the plasma with particle beams to keep it spinning in a cigar shape. That improves the stability of the plasma, allowing more time for fusion to occur and for more heat to be extracted to spin a turbine. The company raised $150 million in June from existing investors, including Google, Chevron, and New Enterprise. TAE has raised $1.79 billion in total, according to PitchBook. Of all fusion startups, Helion has the most aggressive timeline. The company plans to produce electricity from its reactor in 2028. Its first customer? Microsoft. Helion, based in Everett, Washington, uses a type of reactor called a field-reversed configuration, where magnets surround a reaction chamber that looks like an hourglass with a bulge at the point where the two sides come together. At each end of the hourglass, they spin the plasma into doughnut shapes that are shot toward each other at more than 1 million mph. When they collide in the middle, additional magnets help induce fusion. When fusion occurs, it boosts the plasma’s own magnetic field, which induces an electrical current inside the reactor’s magnetic coils. That electricity is then harvested directly from the machine. The company raised $425 million in January 2025, around the same time that it turned on Polaris, a prototype reactor. Helion has raised $1.03 billion, according to PitchBook. Investors include Sam Altman, Reid Hoffman, KKR, BlackRock, Peter Thiel’s Mithril Capital Management, and Capricorn Investment Group. Pacific Fusion burst out of the gate with a $900 million Series A, a whopping sum even among well-funded fusion startups. The company will use inertial confinement to achieve fusion, but instead of lasers compressing the fuel, it will use coordinated electromagnetic pulses. The trick is in the timing: All 156 impedance-matched Marx generators need to produce 2 terawatts for 100 nanoseconds, and those pulses need to simultaneously converge on the target. The company is led by CEO Eric Lander, the scientist who led the Human Genome Project, and president Will Regan. Pacific Fusion’s funding might be massive, but the startup hasn’t gotten it all at once. Rather, its investors will pay out in tranches when the company achieves specified milestones, an approach that’s common in biotech. Shine Technologies is taking a cautious — and possibly pragmatic — approach to generating fusion power. Selling electrons from a fusion power plant is years off, so instead, it’s starting by selling neutron testing and medical isotopes. More recently, it has been developing a way to recycle radioactive waste. Shine hasn’t picked an approach for a future fusion reactor, instead saying that it’s developing necessary skills for when that time comes. The company has raised a total of $778 million, according to PitchBook. Investors include Energy Ventures Group, Koch Disruptive Technologies, Nucleation Capital, and the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation. Now its third-decade, General Fusion has raised $440.53 million, according to PitchBook. The Richmond, British Columbia-based company was founded in 2002 by physicist Michel Laberge, who wanted to prove a different approach to fusion known as magnetized target fusion (MTF). Investors include Jeff Bezos, Temasek, BDC Capital, and Chrysalix Venture Capital. In an General Fusion’s reactor, a liquid metal wall surrounds a chamber in which plasma is injected. Pistons surrounding the wall push it inward, compressing the plasma inside and sparking a fusion reaction. The resulting neutrons heat the liquid metal, which can be circulated through a heat exchanger to generate steam to spin a turbine. General Fusion hit a rough patch in spring 2025. The company ran short of cash as it was building LM26, its latest device that it hoped would hit breakeven in 2026. Just days after hitting a key milestone, it laid off 25% of its staff. Tokamak Energy takes the usual tokamak design — the doughnut shape — and squeezes it, reducing its aspect ratio to the point where the outer bounds start resembling a sphere. Like many other tokamak-based startups, the company uses high-temperature superconducting magnets (of the rare earth barium copper oxide, or REBCO, variety). Since its design is more compact than a traditional tokamak, it requires less in the way of magnets, which should reduce costs. The Oxfordshire, U.K.-based startup’s ST40 prototype, which looks like a large, steampunk Fabergé egg, generated an ultra-hot, 100 million degree C plasma in 2022. Its next generation, Demo 4, is currently under construction and is intended to test the company’s magnets in “fusion power plant-relevant scenarios.” Tokamak Energy raised $125 million in November 2024 to continue its reactor design efforts and expand its magnet business. In total, the company has raised $336 million from investors including Future Planet Capital, In-Q-Tel, Midven, and Capri-Sun founder Hans-Peter Wild, according to PitchBook. Zap Energy isn’t using high-temperature superconducting magnets or super-powerful lasers to keep its plasma confined. Rather, it zaps the plasma (get it?) with an electric current, which then generates its own magnetic field. The magnetic field compresses the plasma about 1 millimeter, at which point ignition occurs. The neutrons released by the fusion reaction bombard a liquid metal blanket that surrounds the reactor, heating it up. The liquid metal is then cycled through a heat exchanger, where it produces steam to drive a turbine. Like Helion, Zap Energy is based in Everett, Washington, and the company has raised $327 million, according to PitchBook. Backers include Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures, DCVC, Lowercarbon, Energy Impact Partners, Chevron Technology Ventures, and Bill Gates as an angel. Most investors have favored large startups that are pursuing tokamak designs or some flavor of inertial confinement. But stellarators have shown great promise in scientific experiments, including the Wendelstein 7-X reactor in Germany. Proxima Fusion is bucking the trend, though, having attracted a €130 million Series A that brings its total raised to more than €185 million. Investors include Balderton Capital and Cherry Ventures. Stellarators are similar to tokamaks in that they confine plasma in a ring-like shape using powerful magnets. But they do it with a twist — literally. Rather than force plasma into a human-designed ring, stellarators twist and bulge to accommodate the plasma’s quirks. The result should be a plasma that remains stable for longer, increasing the chances of fusion reactions. Marvel Fusion follows the inertial confinement approach, the same basic technique that the National Ignition Facility used to prove that controlled nuclear fusion reactions could produce more power than was needed to kick them off. Marvel fires powerful lasers at a target embedded with silicon nanostructures that cascade under the bombardment, compressing the fuel to the point of ignition. Because the target is made using silicon, it should be relatively simple to manufacture, leaning on the semiconductor manufacturing industry’s decades of experience. The inertial confinement fusion startup is building a demonstration facility in collaboration with Colorado State University, which it expects to have operational by 2027. Munich-based Marvel has raised a total of $161 million from investors including b2venture, Deutsche Telekom, Earlybird, HV Capital, and Taavet Hinrikus and Albert Wenger as angels. First Light dropped its pursuit of fusion power in March 2025, pivoting instead to become a technology supplier to fusion startups and other companies. The startup had previously followed an approach known as inertial confinement, in which fusion fuel pellets are compressed until they ignite. First Light, which is based in Oxfordshire, U.K., has raised $140 million, according to PitchBook, from investors including Invesco, IP Group, and Tencent. Though nothing about fusion can be described as simple, Xcimer takes a relatively straightforward approach: follow the basic science that’s behind the National Ignition Facility’s breakthrough net-positive experiment, and redesign the technology that underpins it from the ground up. The Colorado-based startup is aiming for a 10-megajoule laser system, five times more powerful than NIF’s setup that made history. Molten salt walls surround the reaction chamber, absorbing heat and protecting the first solid wall from damage. Founded in January 2022, Xcimer has already raised $109 million, according to PitchBook, from investors including Hedosophia, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Emerson Collective, Gigascale Capital, and Lowercarbon Capital.

Title: America Plants The Flag As The Crypto Capital Of The World

ByLawrence Wintermeyer ByLawrence Wintermeyer, Contributor. The US plants the crypto flag America is rapidly emerging as the “crypto capital of the world” since Donald Trump won the presidential election and adopted pro-crypto policies. Such a crypto-friendly ecosystem is propelling American companies to further champion and develop innovative DeFi products and expand their investor base into larger pools of global institutional capital. This week the Senate approved the GENIUS Act, groundbreaking stablecoin legislation, by 68-30 votes, a convincing margin that signals deeper than expected bipartisan support towards good crypto and digital assets legislation and signalling America’s political commitment to digital innovation in the finance sector. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., and one of the key sponsors of the bill, said in a statement, “The GENIUS Act will protect consumers, enable responsible innovation, and safeguard the dominance of the U.S. dollar.” It is considered by many market pundits that U.S. dollar backed stablecoins will defend and even extend the dollar’s dominance just as it is in the spotlight with central bankers from Europe to China expressing their views on new challenges to dollar dominance. The prospect of the U.S. defaulting on its debt obligations has been mooted, and asset owners outside of the U.S. now publicly admit they have been overweight in their U.S. equity and debt positions for more than a decade of solid U.S. market performance, driven by U.S. technology over the past 20 years like the MAG7. Now, new digital asset innovators are leading the way. Circle’s IPO earlier this month debuted on NYSE at $31 and is now trading at over $200, a breathtaking performance, helping to break trail for crypto companies lining up to IPO including Kraken and Bullish. The crypto treasury playbook, made famous by Michael Saylor at Strategy (MSTR) has also seen a number IPOs including Sol Strategies Inc. (HODL.CN), DeFi Development Corp. (DFDV), Upexi (UPXI), Metaplanet Inc. (MTPLF) and many more. These “pubcos” are a niche class of publicly-traded companies available to all investors which serve as proxies by investing in major tokens like bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana. The US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Crypto Task Force organized its last roundtable on June 9, titled “DeFi and the American Spirit.” The SEC Chairman, Paul S. Atkins’s comments at the event have drawn widespread attention for aligning DeFi’s philosophy with American values. Atkins said, “The American values of economic liberty, private property rights, and innovation are in the DNA of the DeFi movement, and importantly, the right to have self-custody of one’s private property is a foundational American value that should not disappear when one logs onto the internet.” He further added, “I am in favor of affording greater flexibility to market participants to self-custody crypto assets, especially when intermediation imposes unnecessary transaction costs or restricts the ability to engage in staking and other on-chain activities.” According to Statista, the United States generates the highest revenue in the DeFi market globally, with an annual growth rate of 3.59%. Atkins’s positive sentiment toward DeFi and positioning it at the core of America’s value system will provide a further boost to the industry. Wendy Fu, ceo and co-founder at Momentum and a founding member of the Libra project at Meta said, “The SEC Chair’s statements at the roundtable have provided a much-needed regulatory clarity to DeFi protocols, but this is just the beginning. Atkins’s statements also reflect the SEC’s ‘century-old regulatory frameworks’ are out of sync with current innovations and require further updates to suit DeFi’s needs.” Currently, the SEC’s rules are based on traditional “issuers and intermediaries, such as broker-dealers, advisers, exchanges, and clearing agencies.” The drafters of such regulations didn’t consider how self-executing software code like DeFi’s smart contracts would eventually displace the intermediaries. Paul Atkins has asked the SEC staff to explore amendments, seek guidance, and frame rules that may be necessary for new companies to comply. This will “eliminate economic frictions, increase capital efficiency, enable new types of financial products, and enhance liquidity.” The SEC’s DeFi roundtable has supercharged the DeFi sector with tokens like Compound (COMP), Uniswap (UNI), and Aave (AAVE) surging in prices. Besides DeFi’s bullish momentum, crypto companies and legacy firms are exploring IPOs and Bitcoin treasuries to diversify their balance sheets and onboard new investors. On March 6, 2025, US President Donald Trump passed an executive order for the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a United States Digital Asset Stockpile. This gave a massive boost to private companies to establish Bitcoin corporate treasuries (BCTs), functioning as acquisition vehicles and operating companies. But companies must assess whether they want to accumulate USD or BTC to customize their trading and Bitcoin retention approach. Companies holding substantial BTC reserves diversify their offerings, such as Strategy rolling out debt and convertible instruments to address different capital markets investors. A BTC pubco’s goal is to generate a strong derivatives market with sufficient volume to offer low-risk participation for institutional investors. For fixed income and private credit companies, a derivatives market facilitates purchasing debt and capturing delta using short futures and options to offset long exposure. For example, Strategy deployed this combination to ensure a fundraising success with 0% debt. Similarly, companies like Nakamoto raised $710 million for their Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) because the company wants to launch more pubcos globally. Nakamoto follows Strategy’s business plans and has been involved with Metaplanet and other listed companies. This enables Nakamoto to offer efficient centralized services and tap into foreign capital markets that have limitations in accessing other BCTs. Since adopting BCT, Strategy’s stock has gained 2,800% with a market capitalization of almost $102 billion. On the other hand, crypto-native companies like Circle have recently forayed into the public markets, making a strong debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on June 5, 2025. Circle’s shares jumped 235% on the first trading session as the company’s market performance indicates a growing appetite for stablecoins. Amidst massive investor interest, Circle upsized its IPO to $1.05 billion and sold 34 million shares at $31 each. Naman Kabra, founder and ceo of NodeOps, reacted to the market performance, explaining, “Circle's IPO success shows investors and users care about crypto’s real-world use cases and will actively participate if it makes sense to them. Thus, it’s our responsibility to build robust infrastructure, but abstract the technology away from users, so they can only focus on usability.” Public markets are ready for crypto-native companies demonstrating strong revenue charts, robust compliance, and scalable infrastructure. It’s high time we focus on developing cost-efficient, low-latency infrastructure that suits the needs and demands of investors. No wonder popular crypto exchanges like Kraken are preparing for their IPO in 2026 after the SEC dropped its case against them. But Kraken is already reaching out to retail investors by offering tokenized RWAs to US and non-US investors. Since April 14, 2025, Kraken has enabled exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and tokenized stock trading to US clients from select states. But it is now planning to offer tokenized American stocks to non-US customers, thereby opening up investments in traditional assets via tokenization. The RWA tokenization market has grown massively and is projected to reach $30 trillion by 2030. Kraken’s set of microservices aims to take on larger brokerages like Robinhood, as institutional and retail interest continues to surge. According to a recent World Economic Forum report, Ripple and XRP Ledger (XRPL) will also play an important role in tokenizing private equity (PE). The report cites the $1 billion tokenized PE and debt fund launched on XRP Ledger by Aurum Equity Partners to demonstrate how tokenization will improve the efficiency and accessibility of traditional assets. Unique Divine, co-founder and ceo at Nibiru says, “RWA tokenization isn’t simply theoretical. The RWA market has already grown from $8.6 billion in 2024 to over $24 billion in one year, driven by demand for more efficient access to yield-bearing assets. And giant institutions like BlackRock are taking it seriously." The U.S. federal government has already laid the groundwork to develop innovative crypto products with an accommodating and regulatory-friendly approach. With a new Markets Structure Bill in the making, the U.S. is likely to write the playbook for digital assets, and in a shorter period of time than other jurisdictions. Now it’s time for crypto companies to leverage the opportunity and break out of their bubble to bring new investors into the crypto industry and greater market access to products that have shown a firm demand across all segments of the market.

(Bloomberg) -- La Caisse, one of Canada’s largest institutional investors, is doubling down on its sustainable investing targets after meeting its goals for this year earlier than expected. The pension fund, whose full name is Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec, pledged on Thursday to invest $400 billion by the end of the decade in companies committed to decarbonizing their operations and in climate solutions such as low-carbon technologies. “We are reaffirming our sustainable investing convictions because they are at the heart of our fiduciary responsibility,” Charles Emond, president and chief executive officer of La Caisse, said in a statement. La Caisse is encouraging companies it invests in to adopt “clear and credible” decarbonization plans “with a view to long-term value creation and sound risk management for our depositors,” he said. The decision comes amid a fraught political backdrop for sustainable investing. Canada Pension Plan Investment Board has dropped its pledge to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 and Royal Bank of Canada scrapped its sustainable finance commitments in April, just months after leaving the Net-Zero Banking Alliance. As recently as last week, BlackRock Inc., the world’s largest asset manager, said it will shut several US-based sustainable funds. Political support for fossil fuels in Canada means pension funds “will be challenged in their efforts to make smart investment decisions” that account for risks from oil and gas, Shift, a sustainable investment advocacy group, wrote in its quarterly pension report. Bertrand Millot, the head of sustainability at La Caisse, said in an interview that its strategy is rooted in financial rather than altruistic motivations. “We aren’t doing this to save the planet. We are doing this to make money. That is very, very important,” Millot said. There is reason to be bullish about the long-term value of the energy transition, according to Vinay Shandal, global head of sustainable investing at Boston Consulting Group. That’s because it isn’t only important from a climate perspective; it’s also a driver of energy security, industrial competitiveness and access to critical minerals, he said. La Caisse isn’t alone in Canada in sticking with sustainable investments: Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board said it’s moving ahead with its long-term objective of achieving net zero emissions from its investment activities by 2050. Ontario Municipal Employees’ Retirement System said it’s committed to annual measuring and reporting on its path to net zero by 2050. At British Columbia Investment Management Corp., climate change considerations remain a cornerstone of the investment process, said Jennifer Coulson, BCI’s global head of ESG. “As one of Canada’s largest institutional investors, we continue to leverage our size and ownership rights to actively manage climate-related risks and opportunities in our portfolio, including through engagement, proxy voting, and policy advocacy,” she said.

Stock image Property prices rose again in April, pilling more pressure on new buyers trying to secure a home. It was the 20th month in a row of rising home values. Prices were up by 7.5pc in the year to April, according to the Central Statistics Office (CSO). This was compared with a rise of 7.6pc in the year to March. Property prices in Dublin rose by 6.2pc, and prices outside Dublin were up by 8.6pc compared with April last year. The median price of home bought in the period across the State was €365,000. The highest median price for a dwelling was €670,000 in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, while the lowest median price was €185,000 in Leitrim. The most expensive Eircode area over the 12 months to April was A94 in Blackrock, Dublin, with a median price of €750,000. Castlerea, in Co Roscommon, had the least expensive price of €148,000. In April, 3,748 dwelling purchases by households were filed with the Revenue Commissioners at a total value of €1.6bn. These purchases were made up of 2,908 existing dwellings and 840 new dwellings. Revenue data shows there were 1,458 first-time buyer purchases in April 2025. In the year to April, 49,352 homes were bought by households at market prices were filed with Revenue. Of these, 18,146 were purchased by first time buyer owner-occupiers. This works out at 37pc of the purchases. Former owner-occupiers purchased 25,907 homes, or 52.5pc of the total. The balance of 5,299 (10.7pc) were acquired by non-occupiers, such as State-supported housing charities and funds. The latest price rises are in the wake of the Central Bank again reducing its forecast of how many houses will be built this year, saying it now expects 32,500 – just 2,000 more than last year. It is the second time this year that the bank has reduced its housing forecast. In March, it lowered the prediction to 35,000 from 37,000. The latest development will heap further pressure on the Government, which has set itself a target of delivering 41,000 homes this year, which now seems unattainable. Even that target is less than what most housing experts say is needed to meet demand and clear the backlog – about 52,000 units a year. The slow delivery of new homes comes at a time when demand for housing continues to surge. Close to one in five consumers in this country are looking to rent or buy, the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland said, quoting European Central Bank statistics. Demand for housing in this country is now the second highest in Europe, after the Netherlands. The banking lobby group said 17pc consumers in Ireland, or almost one in five, report that they were looking to rent or buy. This is according to the February 2025 ECB Consumer Expectations Survey.

Don’t be fooled by the bipartisan buzz — the Genius Act is a Trojan horse for centralized power, digital surveillance, and ESG-backed financial control. America is on the edge of a financial cliff, and Washington’s so-called “solution” is yet another clever ploy that could further centralize power and lead to a reduction in freedom. The latest scheme is a bipartisan bill dubbed the Genius Act. The U.S. Senate passed the bill on Tuesday by a vote of 68-30. The bill now moves on to the House, where its prospects are less clear. It’s time for the right to sound the alarm and reject the Genius Act — at least until it offers protections for individual liberty. Supporters of the law claim it will modernize digital finance by issuing new regulations for stablecoins, shoring up assets currently used by millions of people worldwide. But the legislation comes with serious threats to liberty as well. It could ultimately become a backdoor way to create a digital dollar, one that offers minimal privacy protections and is easily controlled by massive institutions unaccountable to voters. Officially named the “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act,” the Genius Act aims to bring order and credibility to the booming stablecoin market. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies tied to supposedly “stable” assets like the U.S. dollar. USD Coin and Tether — two of the most widely used — circulate more than $200 billion combined. The bill creates a regulatory framework for stablecoin issuers, allowing them to operate under either state or federal supervision. Lawmakers believe this approach will boost credibility with consumers and financial institutions. The legislation also forces issuers to disclose their reserve assets, submit to public audits, and comply with the Bank Secrecy Act. That law requires financial entities to implement know-your-customer protocols and anti-money-laundering measures — rules that many stablecoin issuers currently avoid. Most importantly, the Genius Act would force issuers to back their coins with liquid assets, such as U.S. dollars and Treasury securities. For example, for every USD Coin distributed, the issuer would need to maintain $1 in reserves or Treasury bills of equivalent value, ensuring that users can always exchange their stablecoins for dollars. The Genius Act has drawn broad bipartisan support on Capitol Hill. Lawmakers from both parties praise its regulatory ambitions. But behind the applause lie serious risks. The bill lays the foundation for a programmable digital currency system — one that lacks basic protections for privacy and liberty. By granting stablecoins federal recognition and placing them under strict oversight and reserve rules, the Genius Act effectively turns them into government-blessed digital dollars, even if the federal government doesn’t issue them directly. That might sound like progress — if the bill actually protected consumers. But it doesn’t. The legislation includes no safeguards to prevent stablecoin issuers from linking usage to social credit systems, such as ESG scores, or restricting legal but politically disfavored transactions. These programmable currencies could easily reflect the ideological preferences of their creators. RELATED: A brutal wake-up call from America’s most powerful banker Photo by Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images Want to donate to a political cause that a stablecoin company opposes? Expect a digital roadblock. Want to buy red meat, a gas-powered car, or anything else that fails to meet an ESG benchmark? Your money might simply stop working. That’s not science fiction. That’s the likely outcome if Congress fails to add robust consumer protections to the Genius Act. No one needs to use stablecoins — at least not yet. The Genius Act doesn’t eliminate traditional dollars. For now, consumers still have alternatives. But that could change quickly. Stablecoins regulated by the U.S. government offer clear advantages over traditional currency. They move instantly, cost little or nothing to send, and operate around the clock. Because they’re digital, they require no physical infrastructure to create or distribute. In nearly every respect, government-regulated stablecoins outperform paper money. Once the U.S. government legitimizes them and guarantees their safety, adoption will surge. As usage grows, demand for traditional dollars could shrink. The companies issuing stablecoins would gain enormous control over economic life. Financial institutions could even begin phasing out physical currency, leaving those who resist digital money with no practical alternative. That’s why Congress must include strong protections for individual liberty in any bill that accelerates stablecoin adoption. Without those safeguards, Americans may one day wake up to find their economic freedom coded out of existence. One of the primary reasons so many in Washington support the Genius Act is that it would increase demand for Treasury bills, which helps the federal government finance its massive debt. The Genius Act would require stablecoin issuers to back their currencies with cash or U.S. Treasurys. Of the two options, Treasury bills often make more sense for the companies issuing stablecoins. Why? Because Treasury bills pay interest. Washington is drowning in red ink. With over $36 trillion in national debt and counting, the government desperately needs someone to keep buying its IOUs. Stablecoins could offer a trillion-dollar solution. By 2028, the Treasury Department estimates that stablecoin issuers could hold up to $1 trillion in Treasurys, so long as legislation like the Genius Act becomes law. The Genius Act isn’t primarily about innovation. It’s about bailing out a bankrupt government. Even more troubling is who stands to benefit. Major players behind these stablecoins include BlackRock, Fidelity, and other financial giants with deep ties to the globalist ESG agenda and organizations like the World Economic Forum. These aren’t neutral actors. They are ideological enforcers with an appetite for control. Are these the people we want managing the digital currency of the future? Are these the institutions we trust to safeguard our freedoms? It’s time for the right to sound the alarm and reject the Genius Act — at least until it offers protections for individual liberty. If we do not act now, we may soon find ourselves in a nation where every transaction is tracked, every purchase scrutinized, and every dollar you “own” is merely rented from a system that can revoke your access with the flick of a switch.

Workplace Savings was launched to help workers build stronger financial resilience by allowing them to contribute to savings directly as they earn. Over half a million UK workers are now using Wagestream's savings product to save for the first time. This easy access product has an industry leading interest rate of 4.33% and is now broadening its scope to allow external deposits for the first time. Clients in the early access programme went live this week, enabling members to transfer in deposits from their linked bank accounts for easy consolidation of their savings. This feature will be made available to all clients from early July. Katie Duxbury, Head of Pay Services & Wellbeing Benefits at BUPA, shared: "Longer term we can see our employees building saving pots and reversing their money story, moving from borrowers to savers with all the positive mental health benefits that financial resilience brings." One in six UK adults have no savings, and a third have £500 or less. With the traditional financial system stacked against 80% of the working world, those on lower incomes are usually the hardest hit. Workplace Savings was created to change that structure. Partnering with Investec, Wagestream is able to offer this market leading product with no minimum deposit or fees to its members, which is usually reserved for high income earners. Employees have the option to save a monthly fixed amount, or they can switch on Save the Pennies, which rounds down each worker's shift pay to the nearest pound, and adds the difference to their savings. Wagestream first launched in 2018, entering the banking movement with a flexible pay solution, which allowed employees to access and withdraw their pay as they earned it. Fast forward seven years, and it has evolved into a holistic financial wellbeing provider – from flexible pay and high interest savings products, to affordable loans, budgeting, coaching and financial education services. Wagestream is at the forefront of this major shift in the employee–employer relationship, as financial services move beyond traditional institutions into the workplace. Peter Briffett, CEO of Wagestream, said: "With the launch of external deposits, we are entering a new era of next generation workplace financial products. This is just the beginning of the revolution, as we continue to impact the lives of millions of people, with fairer financial services." So far, £38 million has been saved by Wagestream members, providing them with more opportunities for growth, freedom and resilience in their day to day lives. Backed by a social charter and the mission to reduce the poverty premium, Wagestream currently serves more than three million members across 2000+ employer brands. This announcement comes on the back of Wagestream recently announcing a £300 million debt financing facility provided by Citi, to expand the Workplace Loans product to its UK member base. World-leading impact investors, Better Society Capital, Social Tech Trust and Fair By Design, along with renowned venture capital investors, Balderton Capital, Northzone, QED, Smash Capital, BlackRock and British Business Bank, have all invested in Wagestream. About Wagestream: Globally, 3 million people now have Wagestream membership through 2,000 brands – across the U.K., Europe and U.S. – making it the world's most widely-used financial wellbeing provider. Offered through employers, the platform attracts more than 12 million monthly visits, helping members to earn, learn, save, spend and borrow on their own terms, all in one smartphone app. Wagestream is a B corporation, built with a social charter to provide fair financial services.

Title: XRP Addresses Holding 1M Coins Reach 12-Year High As Experts Predict Move Above $4

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. The XRP Ledger (XRPL) is witnessing increased network activity, which is bullish for its native token’s price. On-chain data also shows that whales are actively accumulating XRP, with the addresses holding one million coins recently reaching a new high. In an X post, on-chain analytics platform Santiment revealed that the XRP Ledger is showing signs of growth, from both a usage and key stakeholder perspective. The platform revealed that there are now over 2,700 whale and shark wallets holding at least 1 million XRP for the first time in the token’s 12-year history. Additionally, Santiment stated that the number of active XRP addresses has averaged over 295,000 daily over the past week. This is notable as the normal daily average over the past three months was between 35,000 and 40,000. It is worth mentioning that the XRPL recorded some major developments last week. One is the launch of Circle’s USDC stablecoin on the XRP Ledger. This is expected to boost network activity given the increasing demand for stablecoins. Crypto analyst Moon Lambo predicted that this would increase the total value locked (TVL) on the network. He also noted how this was bullish for the XRP price, since users will need the token for every USDC transaction. Furthermore, Ondo Finance launched its tokenized US treasury fund (OUSG) on the XRP Ledger last week, which could have also contributed to the surge in network activity. The BlackRock-backed fund will be mintable and redeemable using the RLUSD stablecoin. Meanwhile, Guggenheim also recently partnered with Ripple to launch the first Digital Commercial Paper on the XRPL. Amid the surge in network activity on the XRPL, crypto analyst Javon Marks has predicted that the XRP price could rally above $4 and even reach as high as $8. He stated that the altcoin is holding a clear breakout and is getting ready for a major bullish continuation. Marks added that the targets are at $4.80 and $8, marking new all-time highs (ATHs) for XRP. Crypto analyst Dark Defender recently alluded to a previous analysis in which he stated that the XRP price could make a decision within two weeks. The analyst is confident that the altcoin could rally to as high as $6 on this Wave 5 impulsive move to the upside. He has also previously predicted that XRP would reach double digits in this market cycle. On the other hand, it is worth mentioning that the XRP price has again dropped below the $2.25 level. Crypto analyst CasiTrades had warned that the support levels at $2.01, $1.90, and $1.55 could be in play if the $2.25 level holds as resistance. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.16, down over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

The Ghosts of K’aresh Public Test Realm (PTR) is now available for testing. These changes are for the first week of PTR testing and do not contain the full patch notes for the update. In Ghosts of K’aresh, the campaign continues as more pieces to a troubling puzzle fall into place. With the release of this content update players will be able to immerse themselves in The War Within story as it leads up to the next chapter of the Worldsoul Saga—Midnight. There’s some unfinished business to be had on K’aresh and the specter of an old enemy looms large. Forces with ill-intent are determined to bring forth Dimensius, the All-Devouring once more to finish off the ethereals. Should he arise, Azeroth will also be in peril from this dangerous Void Lord. Home of the ethereals, K’aresh is a fragmented void-touched world just waiting for players to explore what remains of this little-known land. With shadowy forces working toward bringing Dimensius back into the world, players will need to gather their allies in a bid to put a stop to him and his followers. You’ll fight alongside Alleria Windrunner and her mentor Locus-Walker among others to end the clear and present danger he poses. Players will also have the opportunity to explore Tazavesh, The Veiled Market, work toward restoring the ecosphere in eco-domes, go Phase Diving, and more. Not just a dungeon in the Ghosts of K’aresh content update, Tazavesh, the Veiled Market has been brought from the Shadowlands to serve as a home base for adventurers. Glowing glimmering shields of energy protect the city from the dangers of the cosmos beyond allowing the many survivors of this land to have a degree of safety behind them. You’ll forge through the campaign, gather allies, hunt down the mounting threats found in K’aresh, and set the stage to take on Dimensius himself all from this iconic ethereal and broker hub of activity. Harness the power of the ethereals and see the world through their eyes. An artifact cloak, Reshii Wraps can be used to transform into an energy form much like the ethereals to interact with the world in a new way. You’ll use these wraps to take on a new type of content—Phase Diving— as well as use them in the Manaforge Omega raid, the open world, delves, and more! Reshii Wraps will upgrade and scale with you and include new visuals as you progress through content. Enter untethered space by using your Reshii Wraps to experience a whole new aspect of K’aresh. You’ll experience new creatures, objectives, world quests, and some new mechanics all within this overlay of the world. You can expect to see anything you normally would in the world such as treasures, rare creatures, or objects, but there will also be some unique opportunities to be found such as Warrants. Aid the constable of Tazavesh by hunting down notorious monsters for fun… and profit. Help Ve’nari bring life back to K’aresh with her eco-domes. You’ll help fill them with creatures that thrive within the ecosystem. You’ll scour previously traveled zones to bring back animals to live within the eco-domes and aid them in adjusting to life on K’aresh. It’s up to you to help transform this barren eco-dome into one filled with life and promise for a new future. A massive facility built upon the planet to harvest cosmic energy, players will fight their way in and through this raid dungeon to take on the Shadow Guard Ethereals who have set their efforts toward reviving Dimensius. You’ll join with your allies to ultimately fight Dimensius in a cosmic battle of truly epic proportions to stave off what could be the end of Azeroth as we know it. Raid Bosses Manaforge Omega will be available for testing in a later PTR build. The raid testing schedule can be found here. Season 3 of The War Within brings with it a new dungeon—Eco-Dome Al’dani. This is a three-boss dungeon where you’ll encounter a variety of creatures including devourers who are consuming the life found there. You’ll also face the Wastelanders who have dug in and learn their purpose within the eco-dome. This new dungeon will be available immediately in Normal, Heroic, and Mythic0 (baseline) difficulties. Dungeon Bosses Tazavesh will also return as a full Mega-dungeon and will count as a Mythic+10 in the weekly Great Vault. Season 3 dungeons will be available for testing in a later PTR build. The dungeon testing schedule can be found here. Found within the Azure Vaults within the Dragon Isles, you’ll encounter ethereals, ethereal pirates, and brokers who are plundering the Delve. Using the Reshii Wraps will unlock unique challenge gateways to bosses or challenge rooms. You may also get a glimpse of your friends within the Delve as well or even /mourn them as you observe their ghost from where they died–this feature will be available in a later PTR build. There’s unfinished business with Nexus Princess Ky’veza as well and you’ll take her on one on one as this season’s Nemesis. Along the Delver’s Journey progression, unlock customizations for your Delver’s Mana Skimmer–the newest Delve mount attainable during Season 3–and two new toys, the Delver’s Mana-Bound Ethergate–opens a portal to return to the Explorers’ League home base in Dornogal, and Etheric Brannmorpher–summons an Ethereal Transmorpher that can change your appearance. The ethereals of K’aresh first witnessed this destructive maw of the void after Dimensius’s attack. They believe Reshanor has manifested as their eternal punishment - for it comes back around to keep eating them and their planet as he grows infinitely bigger over the years. With a new season, also comes a new set of class gear. These new sets will feature set bonuses that will align with your chosen Hero Talents instead of your class or specialization. Head to the FEEDBACK: The War Within Season 3 Class Sets forum thread to read all the new set bonuses and leave feedback after trying them out on the PTR. Setzertauren in Stormwind and Orgrimmar will provide class sets for testing. Several PvP talents will be updated with the content update; players will also be able to undertake a new World Quest to vanquish their foes on Vanquisher’s Wake island. This new point of interest is a perfect spot to hang out for those seeking to go toe-to-toe in some outdoor PvP battles. No quest required for entry. Simply turn on War Mode and enter with caution.

(Bloomberg) -- Wellington Management Co., which is best-known for traditional stockpicking funds, is plotting a move into the fast-growing business of buying and selling private equity stakes. The money manager is in talks with potential hires to start a so-called secondaries arm to acquire illiquid positions from other investors, according to people familiar with the matter. The firm is working with an executive recruiter and told candidates about its plans, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information isn’t public. A Wellington spokeswoman declined to comment. The firm, which oversees more than $1 trillion of assets, has its roots in managing mutual funds. Like other money managers, it’s increasingly drawn to the $13 trillion private markets industry as the pool of publicly traded US firms shrinks. Traditional asset managers are also grappling with outflows and squeezed margins as clients leave mutual funds for cheaper index products. That shift — and the allure of higher fees — is reshaping managers that are best known for picking stocks and bonds. Wellington, which has a large institutional client base, has been investing in private equity for at least a decade and has also backed unicorns such as WeWork and Airbnb. In recent years, it has made a more aggressive push into private markets. The Boston-based firm hired a team of four fund managers from Pacific Investment Management Co. this year to start a private real estate credit platform as it aims to grow in private credit. By entering the secondaries market, Wellington would provide relief to investors that need cash because of a prolonged lull in deal exits. President Donald Trump’s tariff war has further hobbled dealmaking, forcing yield-starved pensions to offload their stakes to secondhand buyers at discounts for cash. Meanwhile, elite universities are selling private-fund stakes to shore up cash in the face of threats to their tax-exempt status. New buyers are now stepping into the arena, betting that the secondaries industry could top past records. Exchange-traded fund giant BlackRock Inc., which struck deals to buy three private-markets firms in the space of a year, said in a recent report that it predicts that the secondaries market growth will accelerate.

Title: BlackRock’s $2,900,000,000 Tokenized Money Market Fund To Be Used by Crypto.com and Deribit: Report

BlackRock’s multibillion-dollar tokenized money market fund (BUIDL) is reportedly going to be used by the crypto exchange platforms Derebit and Crypto.com. According to a new report from Forbes, both crypto exchanges will accept BUIDL as collateral, meaning that traders can now use the yield-bearing stablecoin as a security deposit to hedge leveraged bets, freeing up more of their capital to be used elsewhere. As stated by Michael Sonnenshein, chief operating officer at Securitize, a partner of BlackRock, “This is a major turning point. We’re really starting to see not just the emergence but a real solidification of tokenized securities becoming a challenger to stablecoins as the common denominator across the crypto ecosystem. They’re now becoming what we would consider programmable productive capital, as opposed to just a passive investment instrument used for yield or a safe place to park capital.” BUIDL – which launched in March 2024 – quickly expanded across multiple blockchains, including layer-2 scaling solutions Arbitrum (ARB), Optimism (OP), and Polygon (POL), and has $2.9 billion in assets. According to the report, Crypto.com will make BUIDL available for institutional clients in select jurisdictions across its full suite of services, while Derebit, the largest crypto options exchange by volume, which normally takes collateral in the form of Bitcoin (BTC), will make BUIDL available on its spot exchange. The report also notes that BUIDL may soon become available over the top US-based crypto exchange platform Coinbase, as the firm is currently in the process of acquiring Derebit.

Title: CEOs haven't felt this gloomy about the economy since the pandemic
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/business-roundtable-ceo-economic-outlook-index-5-year-low-2025-6
Time Published: 2025-06-18T19:00:44Z

CEOs aren't feeling too hot about the economy. The Business Roundtable's CEO Economic Outlook Index dropped by 15 points in the second quarter to 69, marking its lowest level since 2020 and well below its historic average of 83. A total of 169 CEOs participated in the survey, which was conducted between June 2 and June 13. "The quarter's survey results signal that Business Roundtable CEOs are approaching the next six months with caution," Cisco CEO and Business Roundtable chair Chuck Robbins said in a release accompanying the results. The survey assesses three categories: capital spending plans, hiring intentions, and sales expectations. Hiring plans saw the steepest decline this quarter, dropping 19 points. Capital investment plans followed with a 15-point decrease, and sales expectations fell by 11 points. The survey indicates that 41% of CEOs surveyed expect their company to decrease employment in the next six months, compared to 29% last quarter. The percentage of CEOs surveyed who expected hiring to increase in the next six months also dropped quarter over quarter, from 33% to 26%. It's the latest indication of a challenging job market, as many companies have made moves to flatten their org charts and slow hiring. A number of major companies have conducted layoffs this year, including Meta, Microsoft, BlackRock, and Intel. Other companies, like Salesforce, have announced a pause on hiring engineers. Business Roundtable CEO Joshua Bolten said the quarterly decline was driven by "broad-based uncertainty," stemming from an "unpredictable trade policy environment." The CEO said expanding tax reform is important but will not solve the issue on its own. "American businesses also need the Administration rapidly to secure deals with our trading partners that open markets, remove harmful tariffs and provide certainty for investment," Bolten said. President Donald Trump's tariff threats have taken consumers and businesses on a roller coaster ride over the last few months. While some tariffs were enacted in April, the bulk of new tariffs have been paused until July to allow time for negotiations. The ups and downs have resulted in sharp stock market swings, led some companies to make tweaks to their supply chains, and impacted retail and food service sales as well as the outlook on home sales. Uncertainty around tariffs has made long-term planning difficult for many companies. The Federal Reserve's Beige Book, released this month, indicated that half of the districts saw "slight to moderate" declines in economic activity, while three reported no growth at all. The Trump administration has said that tariff policies are in the best interest of the US, even if they create some short-term pain. While the report paints a largely gloomy picture of CEO sentiment, it's not at levels previously seen during the last recession. The Business Roundtable states that "readings at 50 or above indicate economic expansion," while readings below indicate a recession. In the second quarter of 2020, the economic outlook plummeted to an overall Index of 34.3, and quickly rebounded to 64 in the next quarter. However, the survey adds to a growing chorus of CEOs who are voicing concern for the near future as they navigate a choppy economic environment. Jump to

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Join the leading maritime news network An aerial view shows the Balboa Port, operated by Panama Ports Company, as U.S. President Donald Trump plans to regain control of the Canal, in Panama City, Panama, February 1, 2025. REUTERS/Enea Lebrun (Bloomberg) — China’s largest shipping company is among the firms in talks to invest in a multinational consortium seeking to buy billionaire Li Ka-shing’s global ports, according to people familiar with the matter, in an effort to ease Beijing’s concerns over the controversial deal. China Cosco Shipping Corp. is one of several Chinese state-backed companies in discussions with the consortium led by Italian billionaire Gianluigi Aponte’s Terminal Investment Ltd. on matters including how they might participate in the port deal, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing private information. The buying group also includes US firm BlackRock Inc. and its Global Infrastructure Partners unit. The inclusion of Chinese investors in the consortium emerged as one of the options to advance the ports sale after high-stakes talks in Switzerland last month between Chinese and US officials, some of the people said. Beijing has fiercely opposed the sale — including two ports along the Panama Canal — over concerns it could affect its global shipping and trade ambitions. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump celebrated the deal as returning the strategic waterway to American influence. Once completed, the agreement to sell the two Panama ports and 41 others around the world is expected to net tycoon Li’s CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. more than $19 billion in cash. Talks are ongoing and the details are not yet finalized, the people said. Cosco, CK Hutchison and the Aponte family’s MSC Mediterranean Shipping Co., which controls Terminal Investment, didn’t respond to requests for comment. BlackRock declined to comment. Cosco shares in Hong Kong extended gains to as much as 6% Friday morning, while CK Hutchison erased losses and rose 1.9%. The talks are the latest twist in one of billionaire Li’s most geopolitically challenging deals amid escalating tensions between the world’s two largest economies over global trade. The development has raised hopes that it could ease China’s concerns over the proposed transaction, which has been blasted by pro-Beijing newspapers as a betrayal of the nation and kowtowing to US pressure. The country’s market watchdog has vowed to review the sale, and Bloomberg News reported in March that authorities told state-owned firms to hold off on any new collaboration with businesses linked to Li and his family. Despite the progress of the talks, a deal could still falter. A 145-day period for exclusive talks between CK Hutchison and the consortium ends in late July and the parties have already missed an initial goal of signing an agreement on the Panama part of the deal by early April. The current structure of the buyer consortium will give Terminal Investment ownership of all the ports except the two in Panama, whose control will go to BlackRock, Bloomberg reported in April. Terminal Investment parent MSC has 28 offices across Greater China. It runs a terminal in China’s eastern city Ningbo and operates dozens of shipping services between the country and the rest of the world. In an interview with the Financial Times earlier this week, the head of the Panama Canal Authority said the consortium’s structure means a concentrated terminal ownership which could threaten the waterway’s competitiveness and neutrality. In response, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it supports Panama in defending its independence and reiterated its opposition to economic bullying. It’s unlikely that MSC will be allowed to take over all of CK Hutchison’s 43 ports due to concerns over market concentration from relevant competition authorities, said Eirik Hooper, a senior associate at maritime research consultancy Drewry. Still, any potential changes won’t affect the dominance for MSC, which will become the world’s largest terminal operator by throughput once the deal is completed, Hooper added. © 2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: Circle’s USDC and BlackRock’s BUIDL spearhead collateral innovation in derivatives markets

Innovative collateral use in derivatives markets gains regulatory nod, enhancing risk management and capital yield. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Crypto trading platforms increasingly adopt blockchain-native assets like the USDC stablecoin and tokenized treasuries such as BlackRock’s BUIDL to enhance collateral efficiency in derivatives markets. These instruments offer a blend of stability, yield, and compliance, making them attractive to institutional players seeking capital optimization. On June 18, Coinbase Derivatives revealed that USDC will be accepted as collateral for margined futures, subject to regulatory approval from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said: “This is the first time we’ll see USDC used as collateral in US futures markets – and we will work closely with the CFTC to make this happen.” The stablecoin’s integration will rely on Coinbase Custody Trust, a Qualified Custodian regulated by the New York Department of Financial Services. In a separate development, tokenized treasuries are also gaining traction in the derivatives market. On the same day, Securitize, a digital asset firm, announced that BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) can now be used as collateral on Crypto.com and Deribit. The token represents a short-term yield-bearing fund backed by cash and US Treasuries and currently manages $2.9 billion in assets. By accepting BUIDL as margin, these platforms allow institutional traders to earn yield on their capital while deploying it for leveraged positions. These recent developments underline this trend and mark a significant shift toward more capital-efficient and transparent market structures. Coinbase pointed out that assets like USDC offer near-instant settlement and enjoy broad acceptance across centralized and decentralized platforms. Carlos Domingo, Co-Founder and CEO of Securitize, also echoed this view by saying: “Tokenized Treasuries are being actively used to improve capital efficiency and risk management across some of the industry’s most sophisticated trading venues, while still offering yield.” Meanwhile, these moves follow the November 2024 recommendation from CFTC Acting Chairman Caroline D. Pham, urging firms to explore the use of distributed ledger technology for non-cash collateral. According to her, embracing these new technologies would not compromise market integrity considering there have been “successful and proven commercial use cases for tokenization of assets, such as digital government bond issuances in Europe and Asia, over $1.5 trillion notional volume in institutional repo and payments transactions on enterprise blockchain platforms, and more efficient collateral and treasury management.” Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Additionally, Applied Intuition expanded its global presence with a new office in the UK. BlackRock managing director Samir Menon said: “Our platform has been actively investing in the autonomous driving sector for years, and Applied Intuition has emerged as a key innovation leader. We are proud to back Applied Intuition as they continue their mission to make all vehicles intelligent.” Applied Intuition co-founder and CTO Peter Ludwig said: “The focus of this next phase is to accelerate the rollout of intelligent, software-defined systems across all domains — defence, automotive, trucking, construction, mining, and agriculture. With the continued backing of our investors, we’re just getting started.”

Title: Sex Sells: How OnlyFans Turned Fetish-Friendly Celebs and Porn Stars Into a Multibillion-Dollar Juggernaut That Rivals Legacy Studios

By Tatiana Siegel For the same amount of money it takes to buy one of Hollywood’s five remaining major studios, some investor may walk away with the nine-year-old porn-friendly platform OnlyFans. While Skydance’s bid to buy Paramount in a deal valued at $8 billion continues to spark daily headlines, little-known Hollywood player The Forest Road’s efforts to buy OnlyFans for $8 billion is playing out with far less fanfare. That’s a stunning juxtaposition considering the Paramount portfolio consists of CBS, Showtime and the “Godfather” trilogy, while popular content on OnlyFans includes pictures of Carmen Electra’s feet and nudes of “Wizards of Waverly Place” alum Dan Benson. It also signals an economic shift in the entertainment industry. Related Stories Vincent Cassel to Star in Netflix's Next Big French Movie, 'Quasimodo,' Directed by 'Mesrine' Helmer, Produced by Mediawan's Radar Films “The name of the game is streaming and online content, and the OnlyFans $8 billion valuation could exceed the price tag of some legacy Hollywood studios, speaking to a new world for the industry where headwinds abound,” says Wall Street analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities. Popular on Variety But do the numbers add up? Many in Hollywood’s private equity space are skeptical that Forest Road, which is led by Zachary Tarica and reportedly manages $127 million in assets, could raise $8 billion. The Century City-based film financier has occupied a niche space in Hollywood since 2017, backing such films as Maggie Gyllenhaal’s “The Kindergarten Teacher” for Netflix and Guy Nattiv’s “Skin” for A24. Few outside the AFM set are familiar with the company and its slate of films, which also includes “The Manson Brothers Midnight Zombie Massacre” and “Chronicle of a Serial Killer.” In 2019, Forest Road invested in Yale Productions, which churned out low-budget movies like the 2023 Uma Thurman-Samuel L. Jackson pairing “The Kill Room.” Last month, Yale filed for bankruptcy, listing more than $55 million in liabilities against $18 million in assets. And in 2023, former Disney COO Thomas Staggs and onetime TikTok CEO Kevin Mayer stepped down from the Forest Road board. According to the SEC filing, Forest Road “has expanded its specialty finance platform across blockchain, digital assets, technology, entertainment, real estate, renewable energy tax credit lending, film tax credit administration, and tax credit brokerage.” But a source who has dealings with Forest Road says the company is legit. “They are very much in touch with BlackRock, Ares and these monster funds,” the source says. “They would not have any problem raising huge money on a deal like this.” (In October, Forest Road and Ares Management founders David Kaplan and Bennett Rosenthal bought a Formula E team.) Forest Road did not respond to a request for comment on this story. On the seller side, even less is known about Leonid Radvinsky, the 43-year-old majority owner of OnlyFans. The Soviet-born billionaire, who bought a 75% stake in OnlyFans’ parent company Fenix International in 2018, has reportedly donated millions to causes involving Ukraine and Israel. (Radvinsky has denied that he pledged $11 million to Israel lobbying group AIPAC.) The father of four, who is partly based in Florida, does not do press. OnlyFans declined comment for this story. While a potential Forest Road-OnlyFans transaction is shrouded in mystery, plenty is known about the parade of random celebrities who have migrated to the platform and how they are monetizing their brands. OnlyFans allows content creators to upload videos to their subscribers and takes 20% of their fees. Initially, the content was mostly explicit, earning OnlyFans a reputation as a purveyor of pornography. Bella Thorne was an early adoptee, making $1 million on her first day on the platform, but faced backlash from the sex worker community, which labeled her a “tourist.” More recently, a wide range of notable names have joined. “Harry Potter” alum Jessie Cave, catering to a fetish community, posts videos of and sounds made by her hair. In response to criticism for taking the OnlyFans plunge, Lily Allen wrote in an X post: “Imagine being an artist and having nearly 8 million monthly listeners on Spotify but earning more money from having 1,000 people subscribe to pictures of your feet. Don’t hate the player, hate the game.” Others, like rappers Cardi B and Trey Songz, offer behind-the-scenes content (including adult-oriented material in Songz’s case). At one point, Australian rapper Iggy Azalea was among the top earners, but she has mostly left the platform in favor of Telegram. The two biggest areas of growth for OnlyFans come via the comedy world and sports stars. While Whitney Cummings is the most high-profile comedian on the platform, having debuted a special there, newbies are benefiting most. In 2023, OnlyFans launched the grassroots comedy show “LMAOF,” which highlighted up-and-coming comedians whose humor might be too risqué for mainstream audiences. Some earnings have been wildly exaggerated. Blac Chyna reportedly pulled down $240 million from OnlyFans, but later said the true number was closer to $2 million. Still, there is real money to be made. On June 11, model Sophie Rain, who is believed to be among the highest paid on the platform, posted a screenshot of her earnings from subscriptions alone since she joined in 2023. The figure was more than $76 million. (An OnlyFans source did not dispute that figure.) “The Sopranos” star Drea de Matteo says she staved off foreclosure on her Laurel Canyon home by starting a page and posting racy content. “I got myself out of a lien on my house. I was in foreclosure,” she tells Variety. “But then the men are fickle and they drop off, and, you know, I’m not like super freaking naked all the time. People know that. Like it’s more of a me-and-my-panties vibes. So if you really want to make the big bucks, you gotta go full-on.” Adds de Matteo: “I was a moderate success. But to be totally honest, I wasn’t Bella Thorne. It saved my life, and now I have to think about doing other things because it won’t sustain.” A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment

Title: A Chinese herbal-medicine stock with no revenue has surged 60,000% this year. 5 things to know about the company's mysterious spike.

Shares of a little-known Chinese herbal medicine company have surged this year, with a fresh rally seeing the price quadruple in less than a week. It's been a head-scratching move, since the company is unprofitable, and shares have moved on seemingly no news. Regencell Bioscience Holdings, a Hong Kong-based firm specializing in traditional Chinese medicine, saw its US-listed stock soar 398% over the first two days of the week. But that move pales in comparison to the year-to-date increase, which amounted to roughly 60,000% through Tuesday's close. The company, which offers a proprietary oral formula it says can help treat disorders like ADHD and autism, has not generated any revenue, according to a regulatory filing from October. Over the last two fiscal years, the company said it lost a combined $10.4 million. So, what on earth is going on with this stock? Here's what to know. Regencell, which trades under the ticker "RGC" on the Nasdaq, soared 283% on Monday after its 38-for-1 stock split went into effect. The company originally announced the stock split on June 2. While stock splits don't generate any value for the company — with overall market cap staying unchanged — they are often viewed as a bullish driver, since a lower per-share price can make a stock more appealing to retail investors. Regencell finished Monday with a market cap of $30 billion, which swelled further to $39 billion at Tuesday's close. That made it — at least temporarily — worth more than more well-known companies like Lululemon, Kraft Heinz, and Reddit. The rapid rise of Regencell stock was bound to catch the eye of the retail crowd, but even the enduringly bullish cohort is incredulous about what might be going on. Though Regencell is still less talked about than flagship stocks like Tesla and Apple, users on Reddit were quick to identify the surge this week, with some speculating that Regencell was the market's newest "meme stock." "Regencell is doing some weird stuff again," one user wrote on the subreddit r/shortsqueeze. "I'm trying to decide if I should pull out before a possible crash," another user, who said they were a longtime investor, said on the r/pennystocks subreddit. "I was gambling. Didn't have a clue what this company is," another user wrote on a separate thread on r/shortsqueeze about Regencell this month. "I've been watching it go the last two weeks and keep telling myself that it will crash as soon as I buy back in." Regencell stock was also surging around the time Robert F. Kennedy Jr. continued his anti-vaccine push, with the Health and Human Services Secretary removing all members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices last week, an independent panel that helps shape vaccination policies in the US. Regencell says it has a proprietary Traditional Chinese Medicine formula, a liquid-based oral formula it says can help treat ADHD or Autism Spectrum Disorder. The formula, which is meant to be taken twice a day and aims to treat the "fundamental cause" of neurocognitive disorders, contains "only natural ingredients," the firm says. Its website lists various herbs with qualities that can help with blood circulation, digestion, "detoxication," and other functions. "We have not generated revenue from any TCM formulae candidates or applied for any regulatory approvals, nor have distribution capabilities or experience or any granted patents or pending patent applications and may never be profitable," the firm said in its October filing. The company only has a small number of shares available to trade, one factor that can explain the large swings in its stock. Out of its 500 million shares, just 30 million are available for public trading. That's a far lower percentage than the average for the more widely traded stocks that populate major indexes. Most of the company is owned by Regencell's CEO, Yat-Gai Au. He owned 86% of the company, or a $426 million stake in the first quarter, according to holdings data. His net worth has surged to as much as $33 billion this week, according to Bloomberg, vaulting him into the ranks of the world's richest people. Regencell's second-largest holder, Digital Mobile Venture, owned 7.6% of the company at the end of the first quarter, or around $37.5 million. RBC, BlackRock, and Morgan Stanley also owned miniscule amounts of the stock. Initial public offerings from Chinese or Hong Kong-based firms have been in the spotlight recently. A report from The Wall Street Journal this week said that more than 20 China-based companies and 17 Hong Kong-based companies that went public on the Nasdaq since 2020 have lost 50% of their value or more in a single trading day over the last two years. In 2022, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority issued a warning about a "heightened threat of fraud" related to small-cap companies that had recently gone public on US exchanges. Many of the companies associated with fraud had operators based in China or broker-dealers based in Hong Kong, the regulator said. In many cases, the broker-dealers were allocated 90% or more of the public float, Finra said, meaning they held most of the IPO shares. The small remaining float leaves stocks vulnerable to market manipulation, it said, referring to such companies as "ramp-and-dump schemes." Jump to

BlackRock buys 6,088 BTC, triggering major short liquidations and fueling Bitcoin’s role as digital gold. BlackRock just bought 6,088 Bitcoin [BTC], worth nearly $638.5 million—one of the largest single BTC acquisitions this quarter. Naturally, this injected a fresh wave of institutional conviction into the market. Of course, the ripple effect wasn’t limited to sentiment alone. On-chain data suggests this move triggered a domino of trading activity, forcing speculators to rapidly recalibrate. Following the purchase, short Bitcoin liquidations surged. It was the second-biggest jump after the 9th of June, when liquidations reached a high on a price breakout. Back then, BTC’s breakout triggered mass exits from bearish positions. This time, the pattern repeated. As shorts unwound, the upward pressure kicked in fast. Bitcoin’s price responded with an immediate spike, showing bulls were quick to reclaim control. Moreover, if BlackRock’s allocation inspires follow-on institutional buying, a cascade of liquidations could fuel another leg up. Source: CryptoQuant Despite the price rally, Bitcoin’s Exchange Outflows have shrunk in the last week. Fewer withdrawals of BTC generally mean that traders and investors alike, with BlackRock leading, are purchasing and holding onto assets, looking to further increase their value. That said, should outflows start climbing again, it could confirm another round of accumulation and signal bullish continuation. For now, the market sits on edge, waiting for either a cooling or an ignition. Source: CryptoQuant BlackRock’s timing is crucial. It comes against the backdrop of ongoing geopolitical tensions and growing concerns regarding fiat stability. Traditionally, gold was always the go-to hedge during such times. However, today, Bitcoin appears to be increasingly getting popular as a virtual hedge. BlackRock’s move mirrors the institutions’ attitudes towards Bitcoin are shifting. It is no longer seen as a mere speculative asset—it is being increasingly woven into broader macro strategies.

Title: Auditory cortex neurons that encode negative prediction errors respond to omissions of sounds in a predictable sequence

Predictive coding posits the brain predicts incoming sensory information and signals a positive prediction error when the actual input exceeds what was predicted, and a negative prediction error when it falls short of the prediction. It is theorized that specific neurons encode the negative prediction error, distinct from those for the positive prediction error, and are linked to responses to omitted expected inputs. However, what information is actually encoded by omission responses remains unclear. This information is essential to confirm their role as negative prediction errors. Here, we record single-unit activity in the rat auditory cortex during an omission paradigm where tone probabilities are manipulated to vary the prediction content. We identify neurons that robustly respond to omissions, with responses that increase with evidence accumulation and directly correlate with tone predictability—key characteristics suggesting their role as negative prediction-error neurons. Interestingly, these neurons showed selective omission responses but broad tone responses, revealing an asymmetry in error signaling. To capture this asymmetry, we propose a circuit model composed of laterally interconnected prediction-error neurons that qualitatively reproduce the observed asymmetry. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these lateral connections enhance the precision and efficiency of prediction encoding across receptive fields, and that their validity is supported by the free energy principle.

The discrepancy between the predicted and actual input, known as the prediction error, is used to update the brain’s internal models. This process is thought to occur through canonical circuits, hierarchically organized neural networks where top–down predictions and bottom–up prediction errors create a feedback loop that allows the brain to refine its models. Recent work suggested that positive prediction errors, occurring when the actual input exceeds the predicted input, and negative prediction errors, occurring when the actual input is less than the predicted input, are calculated in separate populations of neurons within these canonical circuits [6–9]. While extensive research has investigated positive prediction errors using the oddball paradigm and its variations [10–18] these studies face significant limitations. Specifically, oddball responses consist of more than just positive prediction errors. First, they also contain sensory signals, which are often hard to disentangle. Additionally, a deviant stimulus also represents the omission of the standard stimulus, thereby generating a negative prediction error, which further complicates the interpretation. In contrast, responses to omitted expected stimuli do not contain sensory input and could directly represent negative error signals, potentially offering a crucial step in elucidating the computation of prediction errors. Omission responses have been observed in human studies [19–24] and more recently in single neurons within the visual and auditory cortices [7,9,25–28]. However, omission responses could arise from processes other than predictive coding and may not necessarily represent negative prediction errors. Therefore, it is crucial to characterize the information encoded in these responses to confirm their functional role and investigate how they might arise from the interactions between prediction and sensory signals, an area that remains largely unexplored. To address this, we investigated how neurons in the rat auditory cortex respond to the omission of expected auditory stimuli while manipulating their predictability. We use high-resolution extracellular recordings to simultaneously record activity from a large population of neurons across multiple cortical layers, while presenting tone sequences where the probability of tone presentations was systematically varied. We identified a subset of auditory neurons that exhibit two key characteristics of negative prediction-error encoding. First, the neurons displayed omission responses whose intensity was directly correlated with the statistical likelihood of specific omitted tones, demonstrating a quantitative representation of the prediction error. Second, these neurons exhibited omission responses that built up from trial to trial, reflecting predictions established by the accumulation of evidence through repeated exposure to the stimuli. These neurons, which we named “Probability Encoding Omission Neurons” (PEONs), were primarily found in the granular and supragranular layers of the auditory cortex and were distributed across different auditory fields including primary auditory cortex (A1), ventral auditory field (VAF), and anterior auditory field (AAF), with a significantly higher proportion observed in A1. Interestingly, while PEONs showed selective responses to omissions, they responded broadly to tones, highlighting an asymmetry between the processing of top–down predictions and bottom–up sensory signals. To explain these dynamics, we propose a novel circuit model that includes separate negative and positive error calculations within narrowly tuned auditory streams, with prediction error neurons laterally interconnected between adjacent streams. This architecture not only accounts for the observed asymmetry and probability encoding in sensory processing but also demonstrates how lateral connections can enhance the precision and efficiency of prediction-encoding, a concept supported by the free energy principle [1,3]. Our findings provide empirical evidence for the existence of negative prediction error neurons in the auditory cortex and propose a circuit-level hypothesis for how these errors might be computed and integrated within cortical microcircuits. In this study, we focused on the right auditory cortex of Urethane-anesthetized rats, utilizing extracellular recordings to monitor responses to auditory stimuli. Across 18 electrode penetrations involving 10 rats, we successfully captured the activity of 990 single units. For each rat, we first used a surface microelectrode array (NeuroNexus, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) (Fig 1A) to map the various parts of the auditory cortex (Fig 1B) [29–31]. We then used a Neuropixels electrode array to record different layers of the chosen area for each penetration (Fig 1C).

The same representation is used as in panel E. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003242.g001 To explore the neural response to auditory stimuli and their omission, we devised eight experimental conditions (Fig 1D). Each condition featured an oddball sequence of two tones with distinct probabilities, along with a consistent occurrence of tone omissions at a rate of 5%. To create varied prediction contents while maintaining a fixed omission rate, we utilized two tones and controlled their relative predictability. We selected two distinct pure tones (denoted as Tones A and B), one octave apart, that consistently elicited responses from most neurons for each penetration (see details in “Methods”). The sequences were systematically designed but presented in a random order. Each sequence comprised 1,000 stimulus items, including omissions, and featured Tones A and B at varying probabilities to achieve distinct levels of predictability. The specific ratios of Tones A and B were carefully controlled as follows: 95% Tone A and 0% Tone B (exclusively Tone A), 90% and 5%, 85% and 10%, and 75% and 20%. This pattern continued, adjusting further to 20% and 75%, 10% and 85%, 5% and 90%, until reaching 0% and 95% (exclusively Tone B). We observed diverse patterns of neural responses to omissions. Fig 1E and 1F illustrate responses from three exemplary neurons to tone omissions during two distinct tone sequences: one with 95% Tone A and 5% omissions, and the other with 95% Tone B and 5% omissions. Some neurons exhibited strong responses when either tone was presented but did not respond to their omission (Fig 1E), and some neurons displayed selective responses to the absence of specific tones, with the intensity and nature of these responses varying depending on which tone was omitted (Fig 1F). To determine whether omission responses encode negative prediction errors, we investigated how neurons’ responses to omissions were modulated by the predictability of the omitted stimuli. For neurons encoding negative prediction errors, their response should correlate with the content of the prediction. In our experimental design, the content is determined by the probabilities of the two tones, which is equivalent to the probability of one tone, since their total is fixed at 95%. Therefore, we first evaluated which neurons’ omission response correlated with the probability of tone presentation. The omission response was defined as the neuron’s mean firing rate during a 5–120 ms window after the omission, with a local baseline subtracted on a per-trial basis. This baseline was calculated as the mean firing rate from –24 to 5 ms relative to the expected tone onset, capturing the neuron’s state just before the tone was omitted [32]. We then computed the Spearman’s correlation between each neuron’s average omission response under each condition and the corresponding probability of tone presentation (either Tone A or B). For each neuron, the tone whose omission response increased with higher probability was designated the “omission preferred” (OP) tone, while the other was termed the “omission non-preferred” (ONP) tone. Under this definition, the correlation coefficients measured against the OP tone were all positive, unlike those measured against the ONP tone, which would be negative. Next, we examined whether distinct groups exist based on how strongly each neuron’s omission response correlated with predictability of the OP tone. To achieve this, we performed k-means clustering on the correlation coefficients and used an unbiased elbow analysis to determine the optimal number of clusters (see details in “Methods”). The elbow analysis revealed that it is optimal to cluster the data into two distinct neuronal subpopulations (see the elbow analysis in S1 Fig): one comprising 771 neurons with little or no modulation of omission responses by tone probability (mean Spearman’s ρ = 0.048), and a second comprising 219 neurons exhibiting a robust positive correlation (mean ρ = 0.18) (Fig 2A).

The p-value shown below reflects the result of a bootstrap analysis comparing the observed PEON count in each area to a simulated null distribution; the asterisk denotes statistical significance (p < 0.05). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003242.g002 Fig 2B illustrates the omission responses of two example neurons across eight different conditions. These range from scenarios with 0% OP tone (95% ONP and 5% omission) to scenarios with 95% OP tone (0% ONP and 5% omission). The peri-stimulus time histograms (PSTHs), aligned to the expected onset of the omitted tone, have been baseline-subtracted to isolate the omission response. Neuron 1 (from Cluster 1 in Fig 2A) exhibited only a weak correlation (Spearman’s ρ = 0.12), while Neuron 2 (from Cluster 2) showed a pronounced increase in omission response as the probability of the OP tone increased (rho = 0.36). To further examine these PEONs without introducing double-dipping biases, we conducted a split-data analysis by dividing trials into two independent subsets (odd and even trials, denoted as ODD and EVEN trials) to ensure the robustness of our analyses. All PEONs were identified using only one half (e.g., ODD) and subsequently tested on the complementary half (e.g., EVEN), ensuring that selection and evaluation were fully independent. Using the ODD trials, we identified 123 PEONs according to two criteria: (1) a significant correlation (p < 0.05) between their omission responses and the probability of the corresponding OP tone, as verified by Spearman’s correlation test; and (2) a significant omission response (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon sign‐rank test) to this OP tone in the four conditions where it was presented as standard (75%, 85%, 90%, and 95%), when the OP tone is most predictable and omission responses should be greatest (see details in “Methods”). We refer to these PEONs as PEONODD. To confirm the reliability of our selection criteria and ensure that the identified neurons were not specific to one trial subset, we applied the same classification procedure to the EVEN trials, identifying a separate group of PEONs referred to as PEONEVEN. For additional comparison, maximizing statistical power and evaluating probability encoding without trial-based data splitting, we identified PEONALL, a group classified using all available trials. Out of a total of 990 neurons, we identified 123 (13%) PEONODD, 60 neurons (6%) showed correlation with probability but no omission response, and 807 neurons (82%) showed no correlation (Fig 2C, top). On the other hand, when using the EVEN trials, 145 neurons were classified as PEONEVEN, 69 showed correlation but no response, and 776 showed no correlation. Although the precise numbers varied slightly between subsets, the classification proportions were broadly similar, supporting the robustness of the procedure. To assess consistency more directly, we quantified the overlap between the two independently identified PEON subsets. A total of 61 neurons were classified as PEONs in both ODD and EVEN trial sets, significantly exceeding the overlap expected by chance (expected: 18 neurons; hypergeometric test, p << 0.001). This result supports the stability of the classification approach, even when applied to trial-split subsets with reduced statistical power. For comparison, when using all trials without splitting, 200 neurons were classified as PEONALL, 70 showed correlation but no response, and 720 showed no correlation. Pie charts for both PEONEVEN and PEONALL classifications are shown in S2 Fig. Fig 2D presents a box plot that aggregates the omission response of all PEONODD on EVEN trials. To quantify the relationship between omission response and OP tone probability, we performed a direct Spearman’s correlation analysis using all individual neuron data points, which revealed a significant positive relationship (Spearman’s ρ = 0.34, p = 1.6 × 10−27, n = 984, representing 123 neurons × 8 probability conditions). The strength of this relationship indicates that neural responses systematically increase as the probability of the OP tone increases, providing strong evidence that these neurons encode stimulus probability. This significant relationship confirmed the robustness of the probability-encoding property, which is likewise replicated in the analysis of PEONEVEN on ODD trials and PEONALL using all trials (see S2 Fig). From here onward, we present the results from the PEONODD group. Equivalent analyses for PEONEVEN and PEONALL are provided in the S2–S5 Figs to further support the robustness and generalizability of our findings. To investigate the anatomical basis of predictive coding in the auditory system, we analyzed the laminar and areal distribution of PEONODD. We used current source density (CSD) analysis of local field potential (LFP) responses to determine cortical layer depths and categorized neurons into layers based on established criteria (see “Methods”). Fig 2E illustrates the distribution of these neurons across cortical depths, demonstrating that PEONODD are distributed across all cortical layers, with a higher proportion found in the supragranular (16.2%) and granular (13.4%) layers compared to the infragranular layers (9.8%). A similar distribution was also discovered from PEONEVEN and PEONALL (see S3 Fig). To assess whether these distributions differed significantly from a random distribution, we performed a two-sided bootstrap analysis with 300,000 samples. The analysis revealed a marginal trend in the supragranular layer (p = 0.058) and a significant difference in the infragranular layer (p = 0.029), whereas the granular layer did not show a significant deviation (p = 0.62). Further examination of these results indicated that PEONs were present at a lower-than-expected rate in the infragranular layer. We similarly examined neuron distribution across different auditory fields, summarized in Fig 2F, using bootstrap analysis with 300,000 samples. This analysis revealed a significantly higher proportion of PEONs in A1 (p = 0.0036), whereas VAF (p = 0.9442) and AAF (p = 0.9926) did not show significant deviations from the distribution expected under the null hypothesis. Further examination suggested that PEONs were present at a higher-than-expected rate specifically in A1 relative to the other auditory fields. To confirm that PEONs encode negative prediction errors, it is essential to show that their responses to omissions increase over time as predictions are gradually formed, reflecting a growing discrepancy between the predicted and actual outcomes. We analyzed PEONODD from EVEN trials and focused on omissions of the OP tone in sequences where it was the standard (75%, 85%, 90%, and 95%), and therefore expected to evoke the largest omission responses. We grouped these responses by their sequence position and computed the mean firing rate (±standard error) for each bin. This grouping tests whether the omission response increases as more tones precede the omission, which is the expected pattern if these neurons are indeed signaling a negative prediction error that strengthens with increasing prediction. Our analysis revealed a notable pattern: the magnitude of the PEONs response to these omissions progressively increased throughout the sequence, achieving a steady state or plateau after approximately 400 standards were presented (Fig 3A). The dynamics of the trial-by-trial omission response were fitted by a logistic growth curve, expressed as: (A) Firing rate of PEONODD for omission events (on EVEN trials) in the four conditions where the OP tone was the standard (75%, 85%, 90%, 95%), grouped by sequence position. The x-axis represents the bin center (i.e., its sequence position), and the y-axis represents the firing rate in spikes per second. The black dots indicate the mean firing rate across all PEONODD for each bin, and the error bars represent the standard error of the mean (SEM), showing variability across neurons. The blue line represents the logistic growth curve fit to the data, illustrating how omission responses evolve over successive standards. Data were averaged across sequences where the OP tone was the standard (95%, 90%, 85%, and 75%). (B) Firing rate of PEONODD in response to the presentation of tones across the first 50 trials. The x-axis represents the trial number, and the y-axis represents the firing rate in spikes per second. The black dots indicate the mean firing rate across all PEONODD for each trial, and the error bars represent SEM, showing variability across neurons. The blue line represents the exponential decay model’s fit to the data, indicating a rapid decline in response intensity over the initial trials as the neurons adapt to the repeated tone presentations.

The logistic function depicts a saturating increase in response magnitude. Here, an R2 value of 0.51 indicates the model’s moderate success in capturing the variability in responses. To demonstrate that the observed increase in omission response was not caused by gradual changes in network activation over time, we also examined how PEONs responded to standard tones over the first 50 trials (Fig 3B). The results indicated a rapid decline in response intensity over successive trials. This decay was fitted using an exponential decay model: where is the firing rate at trial . An R2 value of 0.75, indicating a substantial fit to the data. As expected, this encapsulates the phenomenon of stimulus-specific adaptation or a decrease in positive prediction error, where the response to an expected stimulus diminishes rapidly. These trends were consistent also for PEONEVEN during ODD trials and PEONALL over all trials (see S4 Fig). Finally, we investigated whether PEONs are exclusively responsive to omissions or if they also react to tone stimuli. The population responses of PEONODD from EVEN trials revealed a pronounced asymmetry in omission and tone responses (Fig 4A, top). Omission responses showed tone selectivity based on probability: as described before for PEONODD, the response strength systematically increased with the probability of the OP tone. In contrast, tone-evoked responses for both OP and ONP tones exhibited an inverse relationship with probability. Specifically, the response to the OP tone (blue line) decreased as the probability of the OP tone increased (Spearman’s ρ = –0.19, p = 2.1 × 10−8, n = 861, representing 123 neurons × 7 probability conditions), showing adaptation to the increasingly standard OP tone (Fig 4A, bottom). Similarly, the response to the ONP tone (orange line) increased as the probability of the OP tone increased (Spearman’s ρ = 0.20, p = 6.7 × 10−9, n = 861, representing 123 neurons × 7 probability conditions), which means it also shows an inverse relationship with probability, but with respect to the ONP tone’s own decreasing probability, reflecting deviant detection of the increasingly rare ONP tone. In essence, PEONs selectively signal negative prediction errors only for OP tone omissions, while their responses to both tones exhibit symmetrical adaptation to the standard tone and deviant detection of the deviant tone, without tone-specific selectivity in the direction of probability modulation.

Gray shading marks the omission period (expected stimulus timing), and light blue shading indicates tone presentation. For tone responses (middle and right columns), trials were subsampled to match the statistical power of omission trials, ensuring equalized trial counts across conditions.

(C) The left chart categorizes the 90 PEONs validated on EVEN trials, meaning they were originally identified in ODD trials and continued to show significant omission responses to OP in EVEN trials (90 of 123 PEONODD). These neurons were divided into selective PEONs, which responded significantly to omissions only when OP was the standard, and non-selective PEONs, which exhibited significant omission responses when either OP or ONP was the standard. The right chart further classifies the 59 OP omission-selective PEONs based on their tone responses—those responding to both tones, only to the OP tone, only to the ONP tone, or to neither.

(C) The left chart categorizes the 90 PEONs validated on EVEN trials, meaning they were originally identified in ODD trials and continued to show significant omission responses to OP in EVEN trials (90 of 123 PEONODD). These neurons were divided into selective PEONs, which responded significantly to omissions only when OP was the standard, and non-selective PEONs, which exhibited significant omission responses when either OP or ONP was the standard. The right chart further classifies the 59 OP omission-selective PEONs based on their tone responses—those responding to both tones, only to the OP tone, only to the ONP tone, or to neither. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003242.g004 When examining individual neurons, we found that, as expected from the definition of PEONs, their omission responses were highly selective. A substantial proportion of PEONs detected the absence of one tone while responding to both. This is illustrated in Fig 4B, which shows the responses on EVEN trials of an example PEONODD. This neuron’s omission response (left column) increased with OP probability, exhibiting robust firing at high probabilities (90%–95%). Despite its selective omission response, it showed significant responses to both OP tone (center column) and ONP tone (right column), especially when the tone probabilities were low (5%–10%). To ensure that the selectivity observed in omission responses is not merely due to residual effects from the previous trial’s tone responses—such as lingering activity or altered baseline activity—we verified that omission selectivity is independent of tone selectivity. To do this, we measured the omission selectivity index (OSI) and the tone selectivity index (TSI) for each PEON (see details in “Methods”). The results showed no significant correlation between OSI and TSI across the PEON population (Spearman’s ρ = –0.03, p = 0.78, n = 123 neurons). This lack of correlation indicates that a PEON’s preference for a specific tone (e.g., Tone A over Tone B) does not predict its preference for the omission of that tone. Therefore, omission selectivity was not a residual effect from the previous trials. To quantify this selectivity across the population, we examined how many PEONs exhibited significant omission responses under different conditions. Out of 123 PEONODD, 90 demonstrated significant OP-omission responses in EVEN trials (with an additional 5 showing significant responses only to ONP omissions). Of these 90 neurons with OP omission responses, 59 (66%) were selective for OP omissions, whereas 31 (34%) were non-selective, exhibiting significant omission responses for both tones (Fig 4C, left). To further characterize the omission-selective group, we examined their responses to tone presentations to determine whether they responded exclusively to one tone or to both (Fig 4C, right), 41 (or 69%) exhibited significant responses to both the OP and ONP tones across experimental conditions (see details in “Methods”). Additionally, 3 PEONs responded exclusively to the OP tone, 9 solely to the ONP tone, and 6 did not significantly respond to either tone. Similar trends in tone responses were observed when validating PEONEVEN validated on ODD trials and in PEONALL (see S5 Fig). In both cases, most omission-selective neurons responded to both tones, while smaller subsets responded exclusively to one tone or to neither. This consistency across datasets further supports the robustness of the omission response selectivity and its relationship to tone-evoked activity. In summary, these characteristic responses—observed in a considerable subpopulation of individual PEONs, which are selective for omissions but broadly responsive to tones—mirror the population responses and indicate an intriguing functional asymmetry. This raises the question of how computational principles and circuitry give rise to this phenomenon. To further understand how PEONs, which we presume to be negative prediction-error neurons, can display this observed asymmetry in top–down and bottom–up processing, we developed a neural circuit model consisting of multiple streams within a “predictive-coding module” (Fig 5A). This model was based on the framework proposed by Keller and Mrsic-Flogel, which describes a circuit module that integrates negative prediction error computation [6]. (A) Basic circuit module showing interconnections between neurons. P: prediction neuron, PE+: positive prediction error neuron, PE–: negative prediction error neuron, I+/I–: inhibitory interneurons, I: sensory input neuron. The connection types are also indicated. (B) Temporal profiles of sensory and prediction signals. (C) Lateral connections between two example circuit modules processing different sensory streams.

(D) Full model with 5 sensory streams showing tonotopic organization. Streams 2 and 4 receive full strength input for tones A and B, respectively. The numbers below illustrate the strength of sensory signal (S_strength) in each stream. (E) Distance-dependent properties of lateral connections, showing delay and weight as a function of the distance between streams (see more details in “Methods”). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003242.g005 Each predictive-coding module includes six leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons divided into two streams: one stream calculates the positive prediction error and upregulates the prediction, while the other stream calculates the negative prediction error and downregulates the prediction. A sensory neuron (denoted as I) receives the sensory signal and propagates the information in a bottom–up manner. In contrast, a prediction neuron (P) receives the prediction signal and propagates the information in a top–down manner. A positive prediction-error neuron (PE+) receives excitatory synaptic input from the sensory neuron and is suppressed by the prediction neuron via an inhibitory interneuron (I+). Conversely, a negative prediction-error neuron (PE–) receives excitatory synaptic input from the prediction neuron and is suppressed by the sensory neuron via an inhibitory interneuron (I–). All synaptic connections are static synapses that include three variables: synaptic weight, time constant, and synaptic delay (see details in “Methods”). The activity of PE+ enhances the prediction signal through excitatory analog feedback, while the activity of PE– suppresses the prediction signal via inhibitory analog feedback. In our simulation, the sensory signal was designed to replicate the experiment, featuring an analog pulse stimulus with an intensity of S_strength (ranging between 0 and 1) and a duration of 20 ms, delivered with a stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) of 150 ms (see Fig 5B, top). Conversely, the prediction signal was modeled as a similar analog pulse as the sensory signal, but varied in intensity (P_strength), which could be enhanced by excitatory feedback from PE+ or diminished by inhibitory feedback from PE– (Fig 5B, bottom). It is important to recognize that our model assumes the temporal profile of the prediction signal is learned through a separate mechanism, while the predictive-coding module adjusts only the signal’s magnitude based on prediction error. Predictive coding modules from different streams, each processing a specific frequency according to a tonotopic organization, are interconnected through lateral excitatory synaptic connections. These connections run from PE+ of one module to PE– of another (as illustrated between streams A and B in Fig 5C). Intuitively, this setup enables PEONs, represented as PE–, in one stream to respond to stimuli in another stream, endowing them with a broader bottom–up receptive field. Moreover, this configuration allows an unexpected stimulus in one stream to inhibit the predictive signal in other streams. For example, as shown in Fig 5C, if the sensory signal in Stream B is unexpected, PE+ in Stream B will activate, causing PE– in Stream A to also activate through the lateral connection. This activation will then suppress the predictive signal in Stream A. Thus, when an unexpected Tone B is detected, indicating that Tone A (or other tones) is unlikely, the prediction for Tone A (or other tones) is consequently reduced. Conversely, since the absence of an expected Tone B does not necessarily suggest the presence of Tone A (or other tones), our model does not include lateral connections running from PE– to PE+. Our comprehensive model includes five streams: Stream 2 is tuned to detect the OP tone (Tone A), while Stream 4 detects the ONP tone (Tone B) (see Fig 5D). The model incorporates a simple receptive field structure for sensory signals. Specifically, Stream 2 receives Tone A at full strength (S_strength = 1), whereas the adjacent Streams 1 and 3 receive Tone A at half strength (S_strength = 0.5). Similarly, Stream 4 receives Tone B at full strength, and the adjacent Streams 3 and 5 receive Tone B at half strength. Additionally, the model features lateral excitatory connections between streams that are distance-specific (Fig 5E). The synaptic delay between any two streams is proportional to their spatial separation, and the synaptic weight decreases with the inverse square of their distance (see more details in “Methods”). We conducted multiple simulations using the model, each featuring unique probability combinations of tones A and B, along with a consistent 5% omission rate, mirroring the conditions of our rodent experiments. Each simulation included 500 stimuli—either tone A, B, or an omission (O)—across a total of 75 s. Importantly, every simulation began with no initial predictions across all streams (P_strength = 0). Here, we demonstrate the model’s responses using the example where the sensory inputs consist of 90% A, 5% B, and 5% O, randomly ordered as shown in Fig 6A. The spiking activities of Neurons I, P, PE+, and PE− across the five streams are illustrated in Fig 6B. Notably, Neuron P began firing after a few seconds, particularly in Streams 1–3, which are responsive to Tone A. This activity indicated that the prediction for Tone A was beginning to be established. Consequently, the positive prediction error, reflected by PE+’s spiking activity, began to diminish. Additionally, the spiking activity of PE−, primarily associated with the omission of Tone A, was also observed in Streams 4 and 5. This was largely due to lateral connections from PE+ in Streams 1–3. The prediction signals across the five streams, detailed in Fig 6C, show that P_strength increased and plateaued in Streams 1–3, caused by PE+’s firing, with Stream 2 displaying the highest value. (A) Sensory input sequences over 75 s, showing occurrences of tones A (90%), B (5%), and omissions (5%). (B) Spiking activities of neurons I, P, PE+, and PE– across five streams.

PSTHs display firing rate over time, with colored lines indicating responses to different stimuli. In the top three panels, spike rasters are plotted across the same set of 500 trials.

Our goal was to reproduce the experimentally observed asymmetry: selective responses to omissions of the preferred tone, but broad responses to both tones. The raster plots of this PEON, presented in Fig 6D for a simulation containing 90% A, 5% B, and 5% O, characterize responses to different stimuli: Tones A, B, and omissions O. The PSTH reveals that while the PEON consistently responded to omissions, it did not respond to Tone A (in later trials), which was anticipated. Importantly, the PEON did respond to Tone B, a response enabled by lateral connections. In Fig 6E, we present raster plots from a different simulation with 5% A, 90% B, and 5% O. Similar to the previous simulation, the PEON in Stream 2 responded to Tone B via lateral connections. It also reacted to Tone A, facilitated by the lateral connections from nearby Streams 1 and 3, where PE+ was activated by the deviant Tone A. Notably, there was no response to omissions, as the prediction in Stream A was not effectively established due to the minimal occurrence of only 5% A. In conclusion, the PEON in Stream 2 demonstrated the asymmetry of receptive fields in bottom–up sensory and top–down predictive processing, reflecting the findings in the rodent experiment. Note that this asymmetry requires that the weights of the lateral excitatory connections from nearby neurons (as shown in Fig 5E) exceed the inhibitory weights within the module (see S1 Table). This setup ensures that sensory inputs from the neighboring streams can overcome inhibition to elicit a response on PEONs. When the number of lateral neighbor neurons increases (there are only two in our model), reduced excitatory weights can remain effective. Furthermore, we believe these lateral connections could be activity-dependent (e.g., via spike-timing-dependent plasticity) and further refined through self-organization. However, this lies beyond the scope of our current study. To assess the validity of the proposed model with lateral connections (the model labeled “Lateral PE+ to PE–”), we evaluated two alternative models and compared their predictions against the experimental data. The alternatives included: a model with lateral connections from Neuron I to PE– across different streams (termed “Lateral I to PE–”, depicted in Fig 7A), and a model with no lateral connections at all (referred to as “No lateral”). For each model, we measured the responses of the PEON in Stream 2 to Tones A, B, and omission O under different probabilities of Tone A (Prob(A)): from 0% (95% B and 5%O) to 95% (0% B and 5%O). The results are shown in Fig 7B, together with the correlation between the firing rate and Prob(A).

Top panels show the firing rates of PEON in Stream 2 in response to Tone A (red), Tone B (blue), and omissions (O, gray) across varying probabilities of Tone A (Prob(A)). Bottom panels display correlations between firing rates and probabilities for Tones A, B, and omissions for each model. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003242.g007 In our proposed model, the PEON’s response to omission significantly correlated with Prob(A) (Spearman’s ρ = 0.79, p = 2.1 × 10−108, n = 500 trials; see “Methods” for further details), indicating that the PEON did encode the probability of the stimulus within its stream. For Tone A, the PEON exhibited reduced responses as Prob(A) increased, demonstrating a significant negative correlation between firing rate and Prob(A) (r = –0.73, p < 1 × 10−250, n = 4,750 trials). This occurred because PE+ in nearby Streams 1 and 3 detected less surprise at higher Prob(A) values, leading to less activation of the PEON in Stream 2 through lateral connections (as also noted in Fig 5E). Conversely, for Tone B, the PEON’s response positively correlated with Prob(A) (r = 0.81, p < 1 × 10-250, n = 4,750 trials). At higher Prob(A) values, Tone B emerged as the deviant tone. This led to an enhanced detection of surprise by PE+ near Stream 4 for Tone B, which subsequently activated the PEON in Stream 2 more strongly through lateral connections. In the alternative “Lateral I to PE–” model, the PEON’s response to omission was also correlated with Prob(A) (r = 0.82, p = 4.3 × 10−123, n = 500 trials). For Tone A, unlike the proposed model, the PEON in Stream 2 did not exhibit decreased responses at high Prob(A) values. This occurred because the PEON directly received sensory input from Neuron I, which remained unchanged across different Prob(A) settings. Despite this, a positive correlation between the firing rate and Prob(A) was observed (r = 0.82, p = 4.3 × 10−123, n = 4,750 trials). This was due to slightly increased responses from Neuron I in nearby Streams 1 and 3, which were caused by an elevated membrane potential resulting from frequent stimulation by Tone A. Conversely, for Tone B, the opposite effect occurred: Neuron I near Stream 4 showed an increase in membrane potential due to frequent stimulation of Tone B at low Prob(A) levels. Therefore, despite only minor changes in firing rate across different Prob(A) values, a negative correlation was observed (r = –0.42, p = 3.5 × 10−204, n = 4,750 trials). In the alternative “No lateral” model, the PEON’s response to omission correlated with Prob(A) (r = 0.38, p = 9.2e−19, n = 500 trials), as this encoding occurs within the stream without the need for lateral connections. For Tone A, the PEON displayed no responses, which was anticipated since it could only react to an omission in the absence of lateral connections. For Tone B, the PEON exhibited similar responses as to omissions, since in Stream 2, any stimulation differing from Tone A was treated as an omission. Consequently, a similar positive correlation was observed (r = 0.58, p < 1 × 10−250, n = 4,750 trials). To validate these models, each demonstrating unique encoding characteristics, we compared them to data from our rodent experiment. In our analysis, Tones A and B corresponded to the OP and ONP Tones, respectively. The correlation patterns we observed in our experimental data (see Fig 4A) align closely with the predictions of our proposed model. The positive correlation for omission responses, negative correlation for responses to OP tone, and positive correlation for responses to ONP tone are all successfully captured by the model with lateral PE+ to PE− connections. These results support the proposed model with its lateral connections facilitating positive prediction errors, distinguishing it from the alternative models. The models discussed so far have not taken into account that the strength of sensory signals could diminish due to frequent exposure to a specific stimulus. To address this, we analyzed responses from neurons in the thalamus (n = 130 neurons) across various probabilities of the OP Tone (see S6A Fig and “Methods” for details). Accordingly, we modeled the sensory signal strength, S_strength, as a function of Prob(A) (S6B Fig) and conducted simulations. By simulating various levels of sensory adaptation (see “Methods”), our results reaffirmed that only the proposed model successfully replicated the probability encoding characteristics observed in the rodent data (S6C Fig). Our next step was to explore the potential computational benefits of the proposed lateral connections, particularly in terms of enhancing prediction encoding. How do these connections influence prediction signals? Without lateral connections, not only would Stream 2 predict Tone A, but also the neighboring streams (e.g., Stream 1), due to their broad sensory receptive fields receiving half-strength sensory signals. However, with lateral connections, these predictions are reduced not only by the omission of Tone A but also by the presence of Tone B. Particularly, we theorized that this additional reduction would suppress the already low prediction signals in the neighboring streams. This leads to a scenario where the prediction signal is predominantly strong in Stream 2, thus resulting in a more precise encoding of Prob(A) across streams. To test this, we first assessed the steady value of P_strength after the prediction signal stabilized across various stimulation sequences (as in Fig 6C). These sequences varied Prob(A) from 0% to 95%, with increments of 1%. In Fig 8A, we plotted the time courses of P_strength for each 75-s simulation under different Prob(A) settings, focusing on Stream 2, where our target PEON was situated, and the adjacent Stream 1. For comparison, the time courses for Streams 1 and 2 in the model without lateral connections (“No lateral”) are shown in Fig 8B. The steady value of P_strength was determined by averaging values over the last 50 s (from 25 to 75 s). It was plotted as a function of Prob(A) for both models, with and without lateral connections, across Streams 1 and 2 (as shown in Fig 8C). In both streams, P_strength increased as Prob(A) rose. However, the increase was less pronounced in the model with lateral connections, especially at lower Prob(A) values. We further analyzed the contrast in P_strength between Streams 1 and 2 by calculating the decibel value (logarithmic ratio of P_strength in Stream 2 to that in Stream 1). This contrast was significantly greater in the model with lateral connections compared to the model without, particularly when Prob(A) was less than 0.5 (Fig 8D). This suggested that the lateral connections enhance the contrast of prediction signals across streams.

This is supported by the observation that P_strength was generally lower with lateral connections (as shown in Fig 8C). To investigate this further, we measured P_strength across Prob(A) for all streams in both models (Fig 8E) and then calculated the average P_strength across streams for each Prob(A) setting (Fig 8F). The findings suggest that with lateral connections, the network requires less “energy” or smaller prediction signals to effectively encode sequences, particularly in less predictable scenarios where the occurrences of Tones A and B are equal, such as Prob(A) = 0.5. This demonstrates a more efficient encoding strategy. Conversely, without lateral connections, the network expends more energy to manage more unpredictable sequences. This study aimed to understand how negative prediction-error neurons in the rat auditory cortex respond. We combined electrophysiological recordings with computational modeling to demonstrate an asymmetry in prediction-error signaling, which we attribute to “lateral prediction suppression” where positive and negative prediction errors interact through lateral connections to enhance the precision and efficiency of prediction encoding. Omission paradigms are a powerful tool for isolating negative prediction-error signals, as they eliminate the confounding influence of sensory input present in positive prediction error paradigms (e.g., oddball sequences). In human studies using EEG and MEG, mismatch negativity (MMN) responses to unexpected omissions in tone sequences have been reported, which are interpreted as evidence for predictive coding mechanisms [17,20,22–24,33]. More recently, single-neuron recordings in animals have begun to reveal the neural mechanisms underlying these auditory prediction errors. Studies have reported omission-responsive neurons in the auditory cortex of both awake and anesthetized rodents. One study found that 35.6% of neurons in awake animals and 19.5% of neurons in anesthetized rats and mice exhibited significant responses to the omission of expected tones [34,35]. Another study, using more complex stimuli involving the omission of expected gaps within auditory sequences, also demonstrated robust omission responses in unanesthetized rats [25]. Alongside these auditory findings, multiple studies in mouse visual cortex have documented sensorimotor prediction-error signals, specifically negative prediction errors, in response to unexpected reductions in expected sensory input [7,36,37]. These studies demonstrate that neurons in V1 exhibit negative mismatch responses when expected visual flow is weakened or omitted during locomotion. A molecularly distinct population of neurons in V1 has been identified that selectively responds to unexpected omissions of predicted visual stimuli [9] Extending this sensorimotor framework to the auditory system, a recent study showed that neurons in the auditory cortex responded to unexpected reductions in movement-contingent sound within a virtual reality environment, signaling a negative prediction error [28]. Building upon this foundation, our study’s conceptual advance stems from our paradigm design that systematically varies tone probabilities while maintaining consistent omission rates, allowing us to characterize negative prediction error as a continuous, probability-encoding mechanism rather than simply a binary deviance detector. This approach also reveals the dynamic nature of these prediction signals, which develop gradually through repeated exposure to statistical patterns in the environment. The subsequent sections will explore how these findings, along with our observations of asymmetry in predictive processing, led us to develop a circuit-level model that offers a new perspective on information flow in predictive coding networks. Our model builds upon the framework proposed by Keller and Mrsic-Flogel, which describes predictive coding as a canonical cortical computation [6]. Their model emphasizes hierarchical processing with distinct neuron populations computing positive and negative prediction errors. Consistent with this framework, our findings provide evidence for both types of prediction error in the rat auditory cortex. While we focused on characterizing negative prediction errors in PEONs, we also observed oddball responses in the broader population of non-PEON neurons (S7 Fig), with enhanced responses to unexpected tones. Since such responses have been interpreted as positive prediction-error signals in previous studies, we infer that at least some of these neurons encode positive prediction error [16,18,38–41]. More importantly, our model additionally describes how predictive coding modules, which process bidirectional information, interact both vertically and horizontally across sensory streams. This provides a means for prediction errors to integrate across bottom–up receptive fields. Moreover, we hypothesize that there is also a receptive field for top–down signaling. Traditionally, a neuron’s receptive field is defined by the range of external stimuli that can directly evoke its activity, a concept rooted in bottom–up sensory processing. However, neurons like PEONs are influenced not only by bottom–up sensory input but also by prediction signals generated in other brain areas. Therefore, their effective response properties – what we might term their “predictive field” – are shaped also by the specificity of the prediction. We believe that the asymmetry between the bottom–up receptive field and the top–down predictive field provides a means to integrate predictions and prediction errors, and that it could be inverted (i.e., a larger predictive field than receptive field) at other hierarchical levels. Our circuit model proposes that unexpected stimuli in one frequency stream inhibit predictive signals in adjacent streams via lateral prediction suppression. This enhances the contrast between the predicted frequency and others, sharpening the prediction signal and facilitating more efficient updates to the internal model, conceptually analogous to lateral inhibition in sensory systems, which serves to enhance the contrast of bottom–up sensory input [42]. That is, the lateral prediction suppression we propose for the top–down predictive field is functionally analogous to lateral inhibition in the bottom–up receptive field. Biological evidence strongly supports the existence of excitatory lateral connections between adjacent frequency channels in A1. These connections play a crucial role in spectral integration and the processing of complex auditory stimuli [43–45]. Anatomical studies have revealed that pyramidal neurons in A1 exhibit long-range horizontal collaterals that form connections across different frequency representations, often aligning with isofrequency bands [46,47]. Physiological investigations have demonstrated that these intracortical pathways contribute significantly to the breadth of subthreshold frequency receptive fields, which can span up to five octaves [48,49]. The strength and probability of these connections are distance-dependent, with stronger and more probable connections between neurons tuned to close frequencies, weakening as the frequency distance increases [50,51]. This organized network of lateral connections facilitates the integration of spectral information across different frequency channels, supporting complex auditory processing and cortical plasticity in A1. Similar patterns of lateral connectivity have been observed in other sensory modalities, such as orientation-specific connections in visual cortex [52] and whisker-related connections in somatosensory barrel cortex [53], suggesting a common organizational principle across different sensory areas. The development of these lateral connections might involve both innate and learned components. While the basic framework of these connections may be genetically predetermined, their refinement occurs during early postnatal development through experience-dependent plasticity [54]. This developmental process allows for the fine-tuning of these connections based on sensory experience, optimizing the auditory cortex for processing the specific acoustic environment encountered during critical periods of development. In our model, the one-way excitation from PE+ to PE− neurons allows for rapid recalibration of expectations across streams. This asymmetry enables efficient updating of predictions based on positive surprises while avoiding false alarms from mere absences. Integration across frequency channels enables complex interactions, with sequences of tones providing predictive information about subsequent tones. Naturalistic sounds like tone clouds can activate multiple streams simultaneously, leveraging the network’s capacity for sophisticated auditory processing [55]. Building upon these anatomical and functional observations of lateral connectivity, we can consider how our proposed circuit model might be interpreted through theoretical principles. The free energy principle [1,56] potentially offers an elegant explanatory framework for understanding why these lateral connections may have evolved. Could the lateral prediction suppression we observed be more than just a convenient circuit mechanism? When viewed through the lens of free energy minimization, these connections might represent an optimal solution for efficient predictive processing. In S1 Text, we provide a mathematical treatment that suggests when a simplified form of the free energy principle is applied to a two-tone paradigm similar to our experimental design, lateral interactions between prediction errors across different streams emerge naturally from the formalism. In our mathematical exploration, we considered a simplified generative model where auditory tones at different frequencies are represented as hidden variables with linear relationships to sensory inputs. By deriving the update rules for prediction signals under free energy minimization, we found that the resulting equations comprise three key components: updates based on prediction errors within the same frequency stream, lateral interactions of prediction errors across different frequency streams, and a temporal decay term. Notably, the lateral interaction term emerges from the correlation structure of sensory inputs across different frequencies—a statistical regularity well-documented in natural auditory environments [57]. These theoretical derivations align remarkably well with our proposed circuit model, where lateral connections between PE+ and PE− neurons across different frequency streams play a crucial role in shaping prediction signals. This theoretical perspective raises intriguing possibilities about why the brain might implement the asymmetric receptive fields we observed. The efficient coding strategy—where unexpected stimuli in one frequency channel not only signal prediction errors within that channel but also laterally modulate predictions in neighboring channels—could represent an evolutionarily advantageous solution for minimizing computational costs while maximizing predictive accuracy. Such a theoretical framing might also explain the directionality of lateral connections we proposed, flowing primarily from positive to negative prediction error neurons rather than bidirectionally. While experimental validation of these theoretical predictions remains a challenge for future work, the mathematical alignment between our empirical findings and free energy principles suggests that lateral prediction suppression could be a fundamental computational motif in predictive processing, potentially extending beyond the auditory system to other sensory modalities. Our finding that PEONs are more prevalent in granular and supragranular layers aligns with current views on the laminar organization of predictive coding circuits [4]. These layers are thought to be primary sites for prediction error computation and integration of top–down predictions with bottom–up sensory input. The relative scarcity of PEONs in infragranular layers suggests these neurons may be less involved in generating feedback predictions to earlier processing stages. Regarding their distribution across different auditory fields (A1, VAF, AAF), while PEONs were present in all areas examined, they showed a significantly higher proportion in A1 compared to VAF and AAF (based on bootstrap analysis). This potential enrichment in A1 might suggest functional specializations within primary auditory cortex related to negative prediction error signals, although the presence of PEONs across fields still supports the idea that predictive coding is a widespread cortical computation [6]. However, this raises questions about potential functional specializations not captured by our current paradigm. A notable feature of the PEON omission responses is their shape; rather than exhibiting a sharp, transient peak as seen in typical tone responses, they often display a more gradual onset and prolonged duration [27,32,34] compared to both typical auditory evoked responses and the idealized, instantaneous prediction-error signals assumed in simplified predictive coding models, including our own. While our model effectively captures the probability encoding and asymmetry of PEON responses, it does not explicitly model the detailed temporal dynamics. Functionally, a more gradual negative prediction-error signal might help prevent drastic responses to slightly delayed expected input—contrasting with the rapid responses needed for unexpected stimuli. Furthermore, the negative prediction-error signal could reflect a prediction not only about the content (i.e., the tone) but also about its timing. In other words, the prediction signal could be gradually ramped up according to a hazard function, modeling how the brain adjusts its anticipation of an event as time passes [58–61], and the negative prediction-error signal could follow a similar pattern. We suspect that this ramp-up response involves a recurrent cortical circuit normally inhibited by sensory input; when the input is omitted and disinhibition occurs, the negative prediction-error signal gradually increases. Future computational modeling that explicitly incorporates recurrent connectivity and temporal integration mechanisms will be crucial for elucidating the precise neural mechanisms underlying this observed latency. A notable limitation of our study is the absence of explicit “prediction neurons” in both our experimental findings and computational model. While we identified neurons responding to prediction errors, we did not find neurons directly representing predictions about upcoming stimuli. Predictive signals might be generated in higher-order auditory areas, non-auditory regions providing top–down input, or encoded in a distributed manner across neuronal populations. Further computational modeling of distributed prediction encoding could help guide future experiments by suggesting specific patterns or population-level dynamics to look for in neural data. It is important to consider whether the observed omission responses might themselves be a prediction signal, rather than solely a prediction error. However, several aspects of the PEON activity argue against this interpretation. First, a prediction signal should precede the expected time of the stimulus, while PEON omission responses occur after the expected tone onset. Second, prediction signals should appear consistently across all trials, regardless of whether the stimulus is presented or omitted. Instead, we observe that PEONs exhibit markedly different activity patterns between presentation and omission trials—in some cases showing smaller responses when tones are presented compared to when they are omitted. Thus, the PEON activity pattern is more consistent with a negative prediction-error signal, reflecting the mismatch between expectation and reality, rather than just the expectation itself. Future research should address the limitations of our study, such as the potential effects of anesthesia on neural responses, by comparing findings with those from awake and behaving animals. Additionally, employing more complex stimuli and varying spectral distances between tones could further probe the limits of the proposed lateral prediction suppression mechanism. Another important direction is identifying the specific neuronal populations involved in prediction-error signaling. While our study focused on firing rate dynamics, different neuronal subtypes may play distinct roles in encoding positive and negative prediction errors. Techniques such as optogenetic tagging, juxtacellular recording, or genetic labeling could help determine whether PEONs correspond primarily to excitatory pyramidal neurons or specific subtypes of inhibitory interneurons, providing critical insights into the circuit mechanisms underlying predictive processing in the auditory cortex. All experimental procedures were conducted in strict accordance with the ethical guidelines established by the Japanese Physiological Society for the care and use of animals in physiological studies. The experimental protocol was approved by the committee on the ethics of animal experiments at the Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, the University of Tokyo (JA21-9). The study involved 10 male Wistar rats, aged 11–12 weeks, and weighing between 250 and 350 gms. The animals were housed in a carefully controlled environment with a 12-h light/dark cycle, ensuring optimal conditions for their well-being. Food and water were provided ad libitum throughout the study. To minimize animal suffering, all surgical procedures were conducted under appropriate anesthesia. Upon completion of the experiments, the animals were humanely euthanized using an overdose of pentobarbital sodium (160 mg/kg, administered intraperitoneally), following established guidelines for the humane termination of animal studies. The rats were anesthetized using urethane, with an initial dose of 1.5 g/kg administered intraperitoneally and supplementary doses of 0.5 g/kg provided as needed to ensure stable and deep anesthesia. This depth of anesthesia was confirmed by the absence of corneal and pedal reflexes. The animals were secured using a custom-made head-holding apparatus. Atropine sulfate (0.1 mg/kg) was administered subcutaneously at the onset of the procedure to reduce bronchial secretion viscosity. Local anesthetic xylocaine (0.3–0.5 ml) was applied at the incision site before making the skin incision. A needle electrode was inserted subcutaneously into the right forepaw to serve as ground. A small craniotomy was performed near the bregma landmark to place a reference electrode, ensuring electrical contact with the dura. A larger craniotomy was performed over the right auditory cortex (4.0 mm posterior and 6.0 mm lateral to bregma), and the right temporal muscle, cranium, and dura covering the auditory cortex were surgically removed. The exposed cortical surface was kept moist with saline to prevent drying. Cisternal cerebrospinal fluid drainage was conducted to minimize cerebral edema. Throughout the experiment, an adequate and stable level of anesthesia was ensured by monitoring the animals’ respiratory rate, heart rate, and hind-paw withdrawal reflexes. Neuronal activity was recorded using both a custom-designed surface microelectrode array [62] and a Neuropixels 1.0 electrode array (IMEC, Belgium) [63]. To record neuronal activity epipially over the auditory cortex, a surface array (NeuroNexus, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) comprising 64 platinum electrodes was employed. Each electrode had a diameter of 100 μm and a center-to-center distance of 500 μm, covering an area of 4.5 × 3.0 mm. The array featured 0.3-mm diameter holes between the electrodes to allow the insertion of a Neuropixels array. Auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) were recorded using amplifiers with a gain of 1,000, a digital filter bandpass of 0.3–500 Hz, and a sampling frequency of 1 kHz, employing the Cerebus Data Acquisition System (Blackrock Microsystems LLC, Salt Lake City, UT, USA). We mapped the click-evoked responses to pinpoint the location of the auditory cortex (AC). A click was defined as a monophasic positive wave lasting 20 ms. 60 clicks were administered at a rate of 1 Hz, and LFPs were recorded. The peak amplitude of the middle-latency auditory-evoked potential (P1) within the first 50 ms following the stimulus onset was measured from the grand averaged LFP. To identify three subfields within the AC—A1, AAF, and VAF—we analyzed the spatial distribution of the P1 response. For recording neuronal activity across different cortical layers, we used the Neuropixels 1.0 electrode array [63]. The array features 384 active recording sites (out of 960 sites total) located at the bottom approximately 4 mm of an approximately 10 mm shank (70 µm wide, 24 µm thick, 20 µm electrode spacing), with the reference and ground, shorted together. The probe’s ground and reference pads were soldered to a pin, which was then connected to a skull screw on the animal. Recordings were made in internal reference mode. Data acquisition for the Neuropixels arrays was performed using Neuropixels version 1.0 acquisition hardware, specifically the National Instruments PXIe-1071 chassis and PXI-6133 I/O module for recording analog and digital inputs (Neuropixels version 1.0, IMEC, Belgium). The signal was collected from the most distal 384 recording sites (bank 0) at a 30 kHz sampling rate. Raw voltage traces from the Neuropixels arrays were filtered, amplified, multiplexed, and digitized on-probe. Data acquisition and initial processing were managed using Open Ephys software (www.open-ephys.org). Spike sorting was conducted using Kilosort 3 [64], and further manual curation was performed with Phy software (https://phy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). This process involved removing artifacts, merging duplicate clusters, and discarding units with insufficient refractory periods, intermingled waveforms, or unstable firing patterns. Only well-isolated neurons meeting strict inclusion criteria were retained for analysis. The cortical depth of the recording site, estimated via CSD analysis, had to be within 0 µm to +1,800 µm from the pial surface. The lower bound of 1,800 µm was chosen to confine recordings to the auditory cortex, preventing the inclusion of neurons from subcortical areas or unintended regions. Additionally, neurons had to fire at least 200 spikes per session to ensure sufficient statistical power, while those exhibiting strong drift in firing rate or waveform shape were excluded to maintain stationarity. To assess the frequency-tuning properties of all recorded neurons, we measured the frequency response area (FRA) at each recording site. The auditory stimuli consisted of pure tone bursts with a 5-ms rise/fall time and a 20-ms steady-state duration. The tones covered a wide range of frequencies, spanning 18 distinct values from 1.6 to 64 kHz, and were presented at seven different sound pressure levels, ranging from 20 to 80 dB SPL in 10-dB steps. In total, 126 unique tone bursts were used to characterize the FRA. The stimuli were delivered in a pseudorandom sequence with an inter-tone interval of 600 ms, and each tone was repeated 20 times. FRA maps were generated for each neuron based on their responses to the presented tones. After examining the FRA maps, we selected two tones that were one octave apart and elicited robust responses from most recorded neurons. These two tones were then used as the stimuli for the subsequent experiments investigating the neural responses to tone sequences and omissions using an intensity well above the threshold of a typical neuron. To investigate the neural responses to tone sequences and omissions, we designed eight experimental conditions, each employing an oddball paradigm with two distinct tones and a fixed 5% probability of tone omissions. The stimuli were the two sinusoidal tones chosen before with a duration of 50 ms, including 5-ms rise and fall ramps. These tones were arranged in sequences of 1,000 stimuli, with an SOA of 150 ms. In the first condition, one tone (Tone A) comprised 95% of the sequence, while the other tone (Tone B) was absent. Across the subsequent conditions, the proportion of Tone B gradually increased by 5% increments, while the proportion of Tone A decreased accordingly. This resulted in the following sequences: This design allowed us to systematically manipulate the relative probabilities of the two tones while maintaining a consistent rate of omissions. By progressively shifting the balance between the tones across conditions, we could examine how the neural responses to tone omissions were influenced by the statistical context provided by the sequence. Omission response was defined as the firing rate measured in a 5–120 ms post‐omission window, with a local baseline subtracted on a per‐trial basis. The baseline was computed as the mean firing rate within a −24 ms to +5 ms window relative to the expected tone onset, a period that closely reflects the neuron’s state immediately prior to the omitted tone and controls for transient adaptations or fluctuations that might occur mid‐sequence. The computed baseline was then subtracted from the mean firing rate obtained during the post‐omission period, yielding a final omission response value that was typically around zero when the neuron exhibited no net change in firing rate. Although we corrected responses using this immediate pre‐omission baseline, we also examined pre‐sequence spontaneous firing rates and observed no correlation between those rates and omission responses (see S8 Fig). This methodology is consistent with established work [32], which demonstrated robust omission responses using a similar immediate reference period. To examine the presence of distinct groups based on the strength of the correlation between each neuron’s omission response and predictability of OP tone, we performed k-means clustering on the correlation coefficients. Thus, neurons encoding predictability exhibited either strong positive or strong negative correlations. To determine the optimal number of clusters, we used the elbow method, which identifies the “knee point” in the plot of within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) against the number of clusters. The knee point suggests the optimal number of clusters where adding more clusters does not significantly improve the model’s fit to the data (see S1 Fig). The k-means clustering analysis was performed using the k-means function in MATLAB with 10 replicates for each cluster number. The WCSS was calculated for each cluster number, and the optimal number of clusters was determined by finding the knee point in the WCSS plot. The clustering results were then visualized using histograms to display the distribution of correlation coefficients within each cluster. To mitigate potential biases such as double dipping—where the same data are used both to select and evaluate effects—and to ensure the robustness of our probability encoding analysis, we employed a split‐half approach. For each probability condition, the 50 omission trials were divided into two equal halves—an odd‐indexed “training set” and an even‐indexed “testing set,” with each set providing 25 omission trials per condition. Using only the training set, we computed Spearman’s rank correlation between each neuron’s omission response and the probability condition. Neurons with a significant correlation (p < 0.05) were provisionally labeled as “correlated,” and the OP tone for each neuron was defined based on the direction of the correlation in the training data. From this subset of correlated neurons, we then pooled the training‐set trials in the conditions where the OP was standard (75%–95%) and applied a one‐sample Wilcoxon sign‐rank test (p < 0.05) to determine whether their omission response was significantly above zero. Because the omission response is computed as the firing rate minus a local baseline, testing against zero effectively assesses whether post-omission activity exceeds the neuron’s immediate pre-omission baseline. Only neurons that exhibited both a significant correlation and a robust omission response were designated as PEONs in the training set. All subsequent population plots—such as boxplots or group correlations—were generated solely from the testing set, ensuring that any observed trends were unbiased by the training‐set selection process. Complementary analyses were also carried out using even‐indexed trials for training (with odd‐indexed trials for testing) as well as a non‐split method utilizing all trials; these additional analyses, presented in the in S2–S5 Figs, confirm that our main conclusions do not depend on the specific trial split. To ensure that neuronal responses across different tone probability conditions were not biased by differences in statistical power due to varying trial counts, we implemented a standardized subsampling procedure. For each neuron, within each condition, we limited the analysis of tones to 50 trials per stimulus type to prevent conditions with more trials from exerting disproportionate influence. If more than 50 trials were available, we selected every k-th trial, where k was chosen to achieve 50 trials (e.g., for 100 trials, k = 2; for 200 trials, k = 4, etc.). This ensured that all conditions were analyzed with equal statistical power. For analyses comparing tone responses with the split-half approach used for PEON identification and characterization (see “PEON Identification” section), an additional subsampling step was performed. After the initial reduction to 50 trials per condition, the remaining trials were further divided into ODD and EVEN subsets, with each subset matched to the corresponding half used for omission responses. For each PEON and each repetition, omission responses were extracted from the four conditions in which the OP tone was presented as the standard (i.e., 75%, 85%, 90%, and 95% OP tone). The omission responses were binned based on their sequence position, and for each bin the mean firing rate and standard error were computed, yielding a two-dimensional response matrix that captures the temporal evolution of omission responses. The mean omission response was then modeled with a logistic growth function using MATLAB’s nlinfit function. The model was defined as: FR(n) = a/[1 + exp(–b × (n – c))], where n represents the bin center corresponding to the sequence position, and a, b, and c are free parameters estimated from the data. The goodness-of-fit was assessed by calculating the R-squared value based on the residual and total sums of squares. To control for non-specific drift in neural activity, responses to standard tones during the first 50 trials were similarly analyzed. These responses were fitted with an exponential decay function of the form: FR(n) = d + e × exp(–f × n), where n denotes the trial number, and d, e, and f are free parameters. The fit quality was evaluated using the R-squared metric. To determine the laminar distribution of neurons, we adapted the methodology from Shiramatsu and colleagues [62]. We used CSD analysis on local field potentials recorded with Neuropixels electrodes to identify cortical layer boundaries. The earliest clear current sink, typically corresponding to the border between layers 3 and 4, was used as a key marker. Individual neuron depths were estimated based on their distance from the probe tip, as determined by spike sorting. Neurons were then classified into supragranular (Layers 1–3), granular (Layer 4), and infragranular (Layers 5–6) layers. Cortical thickness and layer boundaries were set according to Shiramatsu and colleagues [62]. To assess the relationship between tone-evoked selectivity and omission selectivity, we computed selectivity indexes – TSI and OSI for each neuron. TSI was calculated as: and represent the neuron’s mean firing rate in response to the and tones, respectively, averaged across the seven probability conditions in which each tone was presented. OSI was calculated as: and denote the neuron’s mean firing rate in response to omissions occurring in the 4 sequences where the and tones were standard, respectively. To test whether a neuron’s tone selectivity predicted its omission selectivity, we computed Spearman’s correlation between TSI and OSI. We constructed a circuit of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons following with membrane time constant and membrane resistance . When , neurons emitted a spike () and were reset to for a refractory period of 2 ms. Synaptic currents and were modeled with instantaneous rise and exponential decay, and equivalently for , with time constants and . Spikes from presynaptic neurons were delivered with a synapse-specific delay and weight as detailed in S1 Table within each stream module. Lateral connections between streams and delivered spikes with delay and weight . Sensory stimulation was presented through the input neuron I by setting its to a constant (target stream) or (adjacent streams) for 20 ms. Similarly, prediction signals were fed to the P neuron by setting with identical timing. P_strength was initialized to 0 and updated by spikes in prediction neurons as follows: and clipped to ensure at all times. Both and were raised to their respective values for 20 ms at the start of each trial, then reset to for the remaining 130 ms. The model was written in Brian2 [65], which allowed calculating exact solutions for the internal neurons of the circuit (PE+, PE–, I+, I–). The remaining neurons (P and I), synapses and P_strength were integrated with a time step of 0.1 ms by forward Euler integration. Simulations were run over 500 trials. To model sensory adaptation, we adjusted the input by using an adaptation factor a, which is greater than zero, and a base firing factor b, which is between 0 and 1. The input strength for the A and B streams under different values of Prob(A) was adjusted as follows: Examples of S_strengthA versus Prob(A) are shown in S6 Fig, with 12 combinations of a (0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5) and b (0.1, 0.3, 0.5). (A) The elbow method was used to determine the optimal number of clusters for classifying neurons based on the correlation between omission response and OP tone probability. The x-axis represents the number of clusters, while the y-axis represents the WCSS, which measures clustering compactness. A sharp inflection point, or “elbow,” is observed at k = 2, indicating that a two-cluster solution best balances model complexity and explained variance.

The largest tokenized U.S. Treasury fund, the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), can now be used as collateral on two of the most active crypto trading platforms, Crypto.com and Deribit, issuer Securitize said in a Wednesday press release. The listings allow institutional traders to post BUIDL tokens as margin for leveraged trades on those two exchanges, while also earning yield on the underlying token. The tokenized Treasury market is one of the fastest-growing sectors among tokenized assets, growing about 400% in the past year to over $7 billion in market capitalization, rwa.xyz data show. These tokens let investors earn a yield on their idle cash, just like a money market fund, but without leaving the blockchain environment. They are also increasingly being used as collateral for trading. With $2.9 billion in assets, BUIDL is the largest of the tokenized Treasury funds and is backed by a short-term yield-bearing portfolio of cash and U.S. Treasuries. "Tokenized Treasuries are being actively used to improve capital efficiency and risk management across some of the industry’s most sophisticated trading venues, while still offering yield," Securitize CEO Carlos Domingo said in the statement. "The [BUIDL] fund is evolving from a yield-bearing token into a core component of crypto market infrastructure."

Title: Globalist Finance-Capital Can’t Get Enough of War. “NATO’s Quest for War”. Ret Admiral Cem Gürdeniz

While the Ukraine War continues, Israel attacked Iran on June 13, 2025, citing the International Atomic Energy Agency’s (IAEA) decision against Iran, which was taken with a small margin of votes, in a conjuncture where the US declared that the Nuclear Talks with Iran in Oman would continue. On the other hand, it has been revealed that the United States, although it knew that this attack would take place and supported it, gave the wrong messages to Iran under the guise of diplomacy and created a suitable smoke screen environment for Israel to provide tactical and even strategic surprises. Thus, while the Russia-Ukraine war as well as the biggest genocide in recent history in Gaza, continues a new and bigger front has been opened in West Asia. Although the ostensibly main reason is geopolitical, economic reasons are at least as important and even its twin brother. Throughout history, finance-capital has been on the side of wars, not peace. Because they work with the goal of constantly expanding earnings. Factories, arms manufacturers, banks want access to new markets, new sources of raw materials. Lenin described this feature of finance capital as the stage of “imperialism”. Finance capital has adopted the principle of waging wars for the world, colonies, raw material resources and new markets. Thus, from the hegemons with which they have a symbiotic relationship, they direct their surplus production to underdeveloped states through both borrowing and investments, and demand military intervention when necessary. This situation is carried out in harmony with the achievement of geopolitical goals of the hegemons. As long as geopolitics and finance-capital vision work in harmony, the hegemon continues to impose its global will. .

(VOA/Screengrab) . On the other hand, the world of finance and capital uses war as a means of overcoming the economic crises it faces. While wars overshadow economic crises, they serve as a new revival for the economy. For example, the United States survived the Great Depression of 1929 with the Second World War. The military industry is also one of the leading elements of finance capital, which wants war. Because as well as being a very lucrative sector, it also makes a great contribution to employment. Therefore, it is always essential for finance capital to always create enemies by maintaining the constant threat environment and to increase defense expenditures regularly. The hegemonic order of the United States functioned in this way, especially after the end of the Second World War. The state structure under the command of finance capital of the USA, which initially used the blood of its own children in Korea and Vietnam, abolished the compulsory military service system after 1973 and the majority started to use the cheap blood of other nations and organizations through proxy wars. Human life has no value for finance capital. The important thing in the plunder of weak countries is the multiplication of profits. It is not worth it if millions die for the gain to multiply. Today, the U.S. supports constant wars to keep Eurasia fragmented, to dominate the rimland geopolitics, to weaken the international transportation corridors led by China and Russia, and to break the influence of organizations such as BRICS and the SCO, in order to maintain its hegemony jointly with finance capital. Although Trump said during the election under the MAGA Slogan, that they would abandon these goals and withdraw into themselves and strengthen their economies primarily as a production and trade power, he has surrendered today. In 2024, the total economic size of the world was 110 trillion dollars at current prices. In response to this value created by real economies, as of 2024, the total contract value of interest-rate derivatives (IRS), currency derivatives and commodity/share-based derivatives of the finance-capital world was 730 trillion dollars. The owners of this value, which is based on 40 times the tangible assets and seven times the real economy, are the global finance capital oligarchy. The vast majority of these large assets are owned and controlled by American banks, huge financial firms such as the American BlackRock, the Soros Foundation, companies such as Rothschild & Co, the Edmond de Rothschild Group, techno-feudal SpaceX, Palantir and London-based (City), etc. As in the past, giant firms and multinational corporations that control finance capital can exert great pressure on governments. War or peace is decided by this structure, not democratically elected governments. Worse still, this structure, which advocates free elections under the discourse of democracy, decides who will come to power in which country. It can influence elections with its monetary power. He can buy politicians. He can make a coup. The vast majority of this structure is made up of people of Jewish origin who have been influential in the financial world for centuries, or groups such as Zionist loyalists or neoconservatives. The hard power of this structure consists of the American, British and Israeli armed forces and intelligence agencies, which are unconditionally linked to each other at the highest level. In the second layer, the extremist NATO structure with a gradual neocon tandem under the control of NATO Secretaries General (France, Germany, Italy, Canada, Greece, Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, 3 Baltic Republics, Sweden, Norway and Finland) and in the Indo-Pacific area, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Philippines, Australia, New Zealand takes place. Political pillars include EU governing bodies, American neocons belonging to the majority democratic party and partly republicans, Zionists and evangelicals as inseparable and indispensable allies of finance capital. Although Trump and the “America First” or MAGA group drew new road maps outside of finance-capital interests to recover the US economy, which had declined in production with a debt stock of 36 trillion dollars when they came to power, they could not impose their own will. They could not stop the Ukraine-Russia war or the genocide in Gaza. On the contrary, they encouraged Israel to attack Iran in a fierce manner. They retreated in all areas. Trump has done almost the opposite of what he said in his campaign promises. This situation is similar to the fact that all three presidents (JFK, LBJ, and Nixon) who came with the promise of ending the Vietnam War had to continue the war. Finance capital plays a major role in the election of elected presidents in the United States. As long as they serve their interests, they don’t cause problems. But anything can happen when presidents take a course that goes against the interests of finance capital and, most importantly, the interests of Israel. Because finance capital has infinite dollar power in its hands. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu thanked President Trump for his support, saying “Long live Israel, long live America” shortly after the June 13, 2025 Iran attack that will determine his political future. Trump also said that if Iran attacks American targets in the region, the United States will protect itself. Although US Secretary of State Rubio said that Washington was completely outside this process, it later turned out that Trump was aware of every stage. In fact, with his rhetoric of peace and negotiations, Trump has made a kind of mask for Israel’s attacks. It is known that Israel has been with Iran from the ammunition it uses to intelligence, air refueling and air/missile defense system support. In fact, it turned out that he had sent 300 Hellfire missiles to Israel weeks ago. On the other hand, Trump’s refusal to visit Israel during his visit to the Gulf countries in mid-May 2025 was considered a serious pressure message to Netanyahu. However, Trump paid the price for this move against the Zionists, who play a decisive role in American politics, with the riots that broke out in the country. Trump’s pressure on Netanyahu seems to have been lifted by the anti-ICE riots that began in Los Angeles and AIPAC’s financial influence in Congress. Trump failed to show the same resistance to Netanyahu as Obama, whom he criticized so much, in attacking Iran. It can be said that the Epstein files may have an impact as well as the role of pro-Israel financiers who provided Trump with large financial aid in this process. This shows that Trump is not as powerful in US politics as he claims. We can already say that in the new election cycle, the voters whom Trump promised to end the wars will abandon him. In fact, Israel has made a huge deal of a bid on Trump and the MAGA group. . California National Guard in front of protestors. (Public Domain) . Whether Trump wants it or not, he has become a slave to neocon and Zionist politics. From now on, Iran’s counterattacks and the intensity and tempo of the escalation will also affect Trump’s political future. If Iran attacks U.S. targets and there are U.S. casualties, that would put a strain on Trump and the MAGA group. If Iran retaliates and there are American casualties, Trump could suffer serious reputational damage in the process. Finance-capital does not care about this situation. A new president is found who will respond to his wishes. If the war turns into a protracted war of attrition, we can imagine that finance capital will be able to launch separatist movements and uprisings in Balochistan, Khuzestan and the Kurdish regions of Iran in coordination with MI6, the CIA and the Mossad, as long as the number of lost lives in Israel does not increase. On the other hand, what will happen after this attack is also very important for the future of the Iranian regime. Because, as always, Netanyahu is calling on the Iranian people to rise up in his speech. The Iranian people have not responded to these invitations in the past. On the contrary, hostility towards America and Israel has increased. This time, the attacks on nuclear facilities are in fact an attack on the reputation of the regime and the Iranian people. After the assassinations in the past, this time with the effect of killing many high-level people, this situation may strengthen the bond with the Iranian regime, on the contrary. Therefore, with the support of the people, the Iranian regime will be able to evaluate this attack as an existential attack and increase the escalation and spread the war. Moreover, the Iranian regime will be able to mobilize all its efforts towards the production of nuclear weapons from now on in order to survive. On the other hand, due to the Gaza genocide, Israel’s reputation and credibility in the international arena has been completely destroyed, except for the United States and a few European countries. There is no longer a state that values the unilateral legitimacy of the attacks of an aggressive and lawless state like Israel. The attitude of Russia, China and the Global South towards Israeli aggression will also be decisive in determining the future. . Fire after Israeli attack on 15 June 2025 (Licensed under CC BY 4.0) . Regional and global geopolitical dynamics are now turned upside down. Israel’s attack on Iran does not only affect the Middle East; it will affect continental balances, US-Russia-China relations and the “global race between the great powers”. This Israeli attack will prevent the United States from gathering energy against Russia and China. If Israel and the U.S. fail to achieve their political and military goals after this attack, and if the Iran-US conflict begins, China and Russia’s access to their geopolitical goals will accelerate. A build-up in the region to protect Israel would upset the balance of power in the Pacific theater of operations by the United States. This creates a huge vacuum for Europe and especially for NATO. This attack has opened Pandora’s box. The future of the Khamenei, Netanyahu and Trump regimes is now entirely dependent on Tehran’s decisions. If the escalation increases and the war spreads, Israel and the United States will be affected. If Iran backs down, the regime will collapse. NATO, under the command of Finance Capital, sees the continuation of wars as an existential necessity. NATO’s function came to an end in 1900 when the Berlin Wall fell and Germany was reunited. However, the opposite happened, NATO expanded. The number of members has increased from 16 states to 32 states today. Image: Mark Rutte (Screenshot von der NATO-Plattform) Since taking office on October 1, 2024, NATO Secretary General and former Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte has been making extraordinary efforts to ensure that NATO is not left without enemies. Even the fact that Russia has been turned into NATO’s worst enemy today does not satisfy him. Its main goal is to drag NATO and Russia into the Third World War, in which nuclear weapons will also be used. It continues all kinds of propaganda activities to increase the defense budgets of Canada and European NATO states without limits and almost foolishly making fools of its opponents. Last week at Chatham House, the Pax Britannica’s repository of imperialist minds and ideas, in the presence of British Prime Minister Starmer, the number one Russophobe and warmonger, he said: “NATO’s economic size is 25 times greater than Russia’s… 50 Trillion dollars. Russia’s economy is 2 trillion dollars… However, with this economic size, Russia produces 4 times the ammunition produced by NATO. If we want to keep our people safe, we have to increase our defense spending to 5% of our national income. You can choose not to do that, but in that case, you’d better start learning Russian.” The salaried officer of NATO does not get up to speed and adds. “It is restructuring Russia’s military and producing weapons much faster than expected… Russia could be ready to use military force against Nato within 5 years.” Rutte’s apparent goal is to persuade the 32 participating NATO member states to increase defense spending to 5% at the NATO summit in The Hague, Netherlands, on June 24-25. Will it succeed? Hardly. The arguments of Rutte and his fellow London Financial Oligarchy and American neocon representatives will only be welcomed by the governments of states such as France, Germany, Italy, Canada, Greece, Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, the three Baltic Republics, Sweden, Norway and Finland, which serve the interests of a handful of western oligarchs and neo-oligarchs rather than the interests of their own people. For the last three years, Rutte has been clinging to the propaganda of the US, the EU and the Zionist-controlled collective western media. It is almost peddling a third world war over the fear that Russia, which was deliberately antagonized by NATO’s unlimited expansion after 1999 and forced to make a move over Ukraine, would invade Europe. He is begging for the prolongation of the war in Ukraine. For the past 80 years, Europe has imported prosperity to its people under the security umbrella of the United States. Rutte wants shock treatment to change the 80-year-old habit and for Europe to stand on its own two feet without the United States. He says: “Every ally must do its part, because the United States has borne more than that burden. Europe and Canada will contribute more, while the United States will remain steadfast in its commitment to NATO. Russia is reorganizing its army with Chinese technology and producing weapons much faster than expected. Russia produces ammunition in three months as NATO produces in a year. This year, it is expected to produce 1500 tanks, 3 thousand armored vehicles and 200 Iskander missiles. Russia may be ready to use military force against NATO in 5 years. Let’s not kid ourselves, we are all on the eastern front now. The new generation of Russian missiles is traveling well above the speed of sound. Distances between European capitals are now measured in mere minutes. There is no distinction between east and west, there is only NATO… A 400 percent increase in air and missile defense is required. We see how Russia is spreading fear from the sky in Ukraine. Our armies need thousands of armored vehicles, tanks and millions of artillery shells. We must double our supporting capacities such as logistics, procurement, transport and health support. The Allies will invest in more warships and aircraft. For example, the allies of the United States will receive at least 700 F-35 fighter jets in total. We will also invest in more unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and long-range missile systems. We will allocate more resources to space and cyber capabilities. What is clear is that if we don’t invest, our common defense will not be credible.” And where are these weapons mostly going to be bought? From the USA, of course. According to representatives of Finance Capital, NATO, which won the Cold War under the leadership of the United States, can do whatever it wants in the European security architecture. According to them, if the Soviets were destroyed without a single shot being fired, this should have continued and Russia should have collapsed as well. The goal was to force Russia into a Yugoslavia-like disintegration and integrate these parts into the western-centered economic and political structures of finance capital. However, this plan did not succeed. Because it is not easy to dismantle a nuclear state. North Korea is standing ground. Rutte’s biggest mistake is that he is making the capability comparison based on national income. The comparison should be made directly on the basis of combat capability. Russia’s intervention in Ukraine, which started with a special military operation (SMO) in 2022, opened a new window to the collective west. Cheap blood had been found. Through the Ukrainian regime, Ukrainians would serve US/EU geopolitics and finance capital. The US/EU has poured a huge number of weapons and financial aid into Ukraine. Up to a million Ukrainians have died. Although the war appears to be between Russia and Ukraine, in reality it is still partly between NATO and Russia. What I mean by partial NATO is that the war is being waged without full NATO consensus with the will of the governments in the London financial oligarchy and the US neo/Ziocon sphere of influence, such as the UK, the USA, Italy, France, Germany, Romania, Poland, the three Baltic Republics. Like former NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg, Rutte is doing all kinds of stunts for the continuation of the war, even though he does not have the mandate and does not have the authority, and continues to reflect the will of the elite decision-making states within NATO, even though there are no NAC decisions. Turkey maintains its active neutrality thanks to the geopolitical leverage provided by the Montreux Convention on the Straits. However, no one should doubt that collective West is making every effort to remove this lever thanks to the mandate lovers among us. In the words of former secretary general Stoltenberg, NATO provides security for one billion. So the remaining seven billion doesn’t matter. For example, you will not hear any criticism from Rutte against Israel about the genocide in Gaza. Nor can you hear any criticism of last week’s denial of freedom of navigation in the international waters of the Eastern Mediterranean by the Israeli Navy with the argument of a preemptive blockade. In reality, NATO is protecting the interests of the 1% US/EU elite, not the one billion. Because this elite controls financial funds, stock markets and money markets seven times (670 trillion dollars) of the total global national income, that is, 107 trillion dollars. NATO is the instrument of this wheel to create and sustain wars. It needs constant threats. What Rutte says: “For example, the allies of the United States will receive at least 700 F-35 fighter jets in total. We will also invest in more unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and long-range missile systems. We will allocate more resources to space and cyber capabilities. What is clear is that if we don’t invest, our common defense will not be credible.” Yes, wars are the lifeblood of the military industrial structure. According to Rutte and his ilk, someone must die so that the factories can work. At the end of the wars, cheap raw material resources should be placed at the disposal of finance capital. It seems that a President like Trump, who came to power by challenging this structure with the slogan of MAGA, is not able to stop wars. The endless wars in Vietnam and Afghanistan are obvious. Wars don’t end when presidents say it’s okay. The oligarchic global finance ends with the decision of the capital structure and the war finance and industry. One façade closes, the other opens. In history, there have been states that have challenged the will of finance capital and hegemony. The best example is the Turkish War of Independence and India’s independence under the leadership of Gandhi. Today, the balances are changing rapidly. Russia, China, North Korea, Venezuela, Cuba and Iran have formed a front of resistance against this impudence, especially in recent years. In the meantime, Trump’s rhetoric and actions about Canada and Denmark (Greenland) cause serious fractures within NATO. However, I think that finance capital will avoid such statements, which will create a fracture within NATO with the discipline of Trump through the Los Angeles uprising, especially in the post-Israel-Iran war period. The US neo/ziocons who serve Israeli geopolitics and global finance capital interests have defeated Trump and the MAGA Group for today. Trump, is now a slave to Israel and neocon interests. After September 11, 2001, Israel and all the states around it was rendered no longer a threat to it. But Iran is different. First of all, it is not like the Arabs. It won’t be an easy bite. Turkey, on the other hand, is the target of the neocon and finance capital world with its obstacles to the establishment of a Kurdish state in the south, our military presence in the TRNC and Cyprus, the sovereign rights provided to us by the Montreux Convention in the Black Sea and the Blue Homeland theses. Today, if the financial capital world controlled by Israel, the US and the EU succeeds in regime change in Iran, they will undoubtedly turn to Turkey in the eastern Mediterranean with this energy and high morale. After the collapse of the Syrian regime, which was the most important buffer state between Turkey and Israel, Turkey became a neighbor of Israel (and therefore the American neocons and ziocons). This is not only a geographical rupture, but a strategic one. This situation shows that Turkey’s southern security doctrine has collapsed. Unfortunately, the interests of the United States and Israel have been served in this process. Israel attacked Iran on June 13 with 200 warplanes. Many of these planes used Syrian airspace. We have contributed to this situation. If Israel enters a confrontation with Turkey tomorrow, it will use Syrian airspace to access Turkey without hindrance. As Israel did to Iran, “pre-emptive strike” or “regime weakening” scenarios can be devised against Turkey. I hope that the politicians in power and the opposition, who supported the collapse of the regime and a functioning state in Syria for sectarian reasons alone , are learning from this picture. The support of the same political group for the Annan Plan in 2004, which will bring the end of the TRNC and our military presence on the island, is also in mind. Israel’s June 13, 2025 attack dramatically affected the geopolitics of the region and the diplomatic and military balances. In this confusion, we need to determine our geopolitical position very clearly. The future of the Iranian regime has become completely dependent on Iran’s actions. If tensions escalate and escalate into a full-scale war, the U.S. and Israel will be shaken, and if Iran withdraws, the regime will collapse. Turkey must clearly determine where it stands in this mess. It should not be forgotten that the collapse of Iran is much more than a regime change. This is the collapse of a regional resistance, that is, the disappearance of the last of Turkey’s geopolitical buffers after Syria. If Iran falls, there will be no defensive line around Turkey, consisting of independent blocs. Syria has already collapsed; Iraq is de facto divided. The message that Turkey will be next in line after Iran is no longer a conspiracy, but a clear expression of the dynamics in the region itself. This is an attack not only on Iran, but also on the independent defense reflexes of finance capital in the face of neocon hegemony. If Iran is a target today, tomorrow Turkey’s geopolitical interests and all its strategic programs and efforts will be turned into legitimate targets. The vacuum created by the collapse of Iran will be filled by new proxies of Israel and the United States. If Turkey remains passive in this process, it will face a hostile generation around itself. Passive diplomacy and the “wait-and-see” reflex produce active siege. Turkey may enter the “next country” pot after the collapse of Iran. “The “Iran Operation” is a message directed at all countries in the region that have independent defense doctrines. If Iran fails to respond, it will collapse. If Turkey does not prepare, it will be next. Turkey should be able to transform its national power into strategic influence. Turkey should not fall into the position of a weak country, especially in the field of Strategy. Israel may have lost its legitimacy, but it is actually establishing influence through its active strategy and ability to move. Turkey should increase its technological, diplomatic and military preparations to transform its power into strategic effectiveness. First of all, internal peace and stability must be established immediately. Internal political settling of scores must be put aside. Under the discourse of Turkey without terrorism, all kinds of initiatives and discourses that will harm the constitutional amendment and the spirit of Lausanne should be avoided. A Monaco Model integration model should be adopted with the TRNC as soon as possible, and naval and air bases should be established on the island quickly. A new army should be established for Southeastern Anatolia, Iraq and Syria, and preventive measures should be taken if necessary against any attempt by the YPG/PYD and similar formations in Syria against an independent Kurdish state. Restrictive measures against the US, EU and Israeli influence agents in Turkey should be taken immediately. In this context, measures should be taken and control measures should be taken in advance to implement the destruction tactics applied in Russia and Iran through drones secretly smuggled into the country by trucks, in areas close to critical bases, factories, strategic locations and command and control centers in Turkey. Our last word: “Think and practice like Atatürk.” Let’s not forget that 100 years ago, the biggest owner of finance capital and hegemony was spoiled by the British; The Turks were the only nation that could slap in the face in Kut Ül Amare, in the War of Independence and in Lausanne and was never a colony. We succeeded 100 years ago and we will succeed again. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article. Follow us on Instagram and X and subscribe to our Telegram Channel.
