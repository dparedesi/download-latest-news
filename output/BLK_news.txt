We recently published a list of 10 Worst ARK Stocks To Buy According to Short Sellers. In this article, we are going to take a look at where SoFi Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SOFI) stands against other worst ARK stocks to buy according to short sellers. Cathie Wood of ARK Investment is one of Wall Street’s most well-known hedge fund bosses. In a hedge fund industry dominated by players that focus on quantitative trading, value stocks, and balanced portfolios, Wood stands out from the pack by focusing on disruptive innovation and firms that she and her firm believe will change the world. This relentless focus on change means that if the economy is facing turbulence, then markets are not kind to Wood. To understand how: consider the cumulative value of her firm’s holdings as indicated by its 13F SEC filings. Starting from Q3 2020, analyzing the value for each subsequent year’s third quarter reveals how Ark Invest’s fortune fluctuates with economic winds. The hedge fund’s holdings were valued at $16.8 billion, $41.6 billion, $14.3 billion, and $13 billion during Q3 2020, Q3 2021, Q3 2022, and Q3 2023, respectively. This shows that the value of Ark Invest’s holdings jumped by 148% between the third quarters of 2020 and 2021. Looking back to see why, market conditions back then were marked by easy liquidity, a surge in retail investing, and Wall Street’s bullishness for technology stocks. Technology and growth stocks are precisely the kinds that Wood invests in, and in the time period being analyzed, the shares of Elon Musk’s car company alone soared by 87%. Wood is one of the firm’s largest investors, and her patience has yielded results. Insider Monkey’s data shows that Ark Invest first bought the shares at an average price of $13.14 during Q4 2016. While it has grown its holdings from the 274,725 shares held back then to 4.6 million shares as of Q3 2024, even if Wood hadn’t bought additional shares, her original holdings would currently be worth $62.7 million right now for a remarkable 1,508% gain! Yet, while Musk’s company is Wood’s greatest hit, there have been misses as well since the idea of investing in disruptive innovation carries the unavoidable pitfall of targeting some firms that fail to deliver on lofty ideas. We analyzed the share price performance of some of her longest-held stocks as part of our coverage of 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold For 5 Years According to Cathie Wood. At the time the list was published, its three worst-performing stocks were down by 81.85%, 95.11%, and 99% since 2020 end. Extrapolating their performance to December 2024, the first two stocks, which rank 2nd and 4th have lost 75% and 94.5%. At the heart of Ark Invest’s trading strategy is the fund’s flagship ARK Innovation ETF fund. Over the past five years, this fund has gained a modest 23% which is substantially lower than the flagship S&P index’s 93.5%. Zooming into its 2024 performance, this fund has gained 20.5% while the index is up by 28.3%. Wood’s ETF’s performance can also be divided into pre and post-election gains. Before the election, it was down 7.6% year-to-date after having bled 13% during H1 2024. As H1 ended, Wood acknowledged the troubling time her firm was facing in an investor letter. She admitted “fully that the macro environment and some stock picks have challenged our recent performance” but went on to add that her firm’s “conviction in and commitment to investing in disruptive innovation have not wavered.” According to Wood, Ark had to remain persistent back then since exiting our strategies now would crystallize losses that lower interest rates and reversions to the mean should transform into meaningful profits during the next few years.” The mean reversion she is referring to is the differential in the performance between the Russel Value and Growth stock indexes in the infamous dot-com bubble. Wood pointed out that “At its worst in 2000, the Russell Value Index underperformed the Russell Growth Index by more ~3,500 basis points on a year-over-year basis but, within roughly one year, the relative performance flipped and reached a positive ~4,800 basis points, more than an 80-percentage point swing, as shown below.” She believes that Ark’s strategy to diversify away from the Magnificent 6 (Magnificent 7 ex Tesla) through “increased exposure to multiomics stocks that have been hit hardest by “higher for longer” interest rates” led to disappointing performance. The potential upside from this diversification was evident in 2023 as the flagship fund “appreciated 68% as the bull market started to broaden out based on just the “whiff” of lower interest rates, despite its diversification away from the Magnificent Six and toward what we believe are more disruptive names,” according to Wood. To wit, while the flagship fund was down 7.6% YTD before the election after the ballots were cast and counted, it has gained 26% to bring its YTD performance to 20.46%. The benchmark S&P index, on the other hand, is up by 28.3%. For our list of the worst Ark stocks to buy according to short sellers, we ranked the 110 largest holdings in Ark Invest’s Q3 2024 SEC filings by the percentage of shares outstanding that were sold short and selected the stocks with the highest percentage. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Short Interest as % of Shares Outstanding: 13.70% Number of Hedge Fund Investors In Q3 2024: 31 Ark Invest’s Q3 2024 Stake: $99.1 million SoFi Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SOFI) is a sizable financial services provider based in San Francisco, California. It provides lending services, financial technology products, and benefits management products among others. The firm depends heavily on interest income to fund its operations. As of H1 2024, SoFi Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SOFI) earned $1.3 billion in interest income and $428 million in noninterest income. Consequently, a lower interest rate environment could play out in its favor as services such as loan refinancing, mortgages, and personal loans see greater demand from consumers. The bulk of SoFi Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SOFI)’s interest income is from loans, and the firm’s noninterest income comes from various areas such as its technology platforms. In H1, income from technology platforms grew by 11% to somewhat mitigate the effects of a 48% drop in loan origination income due to high interest rates. SoFi Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SOFI)’s management commented on its outlook of a relaxed regulatory environment during the Q3 2024 earnings call. Here is what they said: “It should now be crystal clear that SoFi can drive sustained growth across the cycle. We’ve achieved 17 of 19 quarters of record revenue through a recession, a pandemic, a 150 basis point rate drop, damage to our largest and most profitable business, student loan refinance, only to face a 500 basis point increase in rates and the collapse of venerable financial institutions in our neighborhood. The innovations we have driven to scale our non-lending revenue, which are capital-light and high ROE, have enabled us to grow our total revenue by more than 20% year-over-year for 17 consecutive quarters, as well as grow both our members and products by 35% or more year-over-year, excluding digital asset accounts transferred in 2023. Our performance in the hard times is what gives me strong confidence in our future. Overall, SOFI ranks 9th on our list of worst ARK stocks to buy according to short sellers. While we acknowledge the potential of SOFI as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than SOFI but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

(NASDAQ:NTLA) is another genomic stock. The firm is developing treatments for diseases such as angioedema, lung ailments, hemophilia, and others. Since Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTLA) does not sell any drugs in the market, under-development treatments are crucial to the firm’s hypothesis. Two of its leading drug candidates are NTLA-2002 and NTLA-2001. These drugs target angioedema and cardiomyopathy, respectively. They are currently in Phase 2 trials and Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTLA) is enrolling patients for NTLA-2002’s Phase 3 trials. The firm’s shares are down 52% year-to-date, but the two drugs will enter Phase 3 trials soon to further create certainty around Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTLA)’s portfolio. Additionally, the firm also has other drugs such as NTLA-3001 in its portfolio which creates additional room to get a drug to the market. Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTLA)’s management commented on its under-development drugs during the Q3 2024 earnings call. Here is what they said: “In October, at The American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology Annual Scientific Meeting, we presented unprecedented positive results from our Phase II study of NTLA-2002 for the treatment of Hereditary Angioedema. These results showed that a simple one-time infusion of NTLA-2002 offers patients the potential for a functional cure. For people living with HAE, current treatment options are limited to chronically administered prophylactic therapies to prevent or manage attacks, and the use of on-demand therapy to control breakthrough attacks. Overall, NTLA ranks 6th on our list of worst ARK stocks to buy according to short sellers. While we acknowledge the potential of NTLA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Why Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Among Halvorsen’s Top Stock Picks Right Now?

Time Published: 2024-12-11T15:55:57Z

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of Norwegian Billionaire Halvorsen's Top 10 Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against Halvorsen's other top stock picks. Ole Andreas Halvorsen, the founder and CEO of Viking Global, has built one of the most respected names in the hedge fund world. Born in Norway, Halvorson graduated with an undergraduate degree in economics from Williams College in 1986. He then later earned a postgraduate business degree from Stanford University. Having received his first taste of finance while working for Morgan Stanley, he’s part of an elite group of investors known as the “Tiger Cubs,” former protégés of hedge fund legend Julian Robertson, who went on to launch their own successful firms. Viking Global, based in Greenwich, Connecticut, has grown into an investment powerhouse. Back in 2023, the firm delivered an impressive $6 billion in returns for its investors, ranking just behind heavyweights like Citadel and TCI. Much of this success came from smart bets on big names. In the same year, Halvorsen decided to reopen Viking Global's long/short flagship fund to new investors. Over a decade ago, he had closed the fund, citing its size as a barrier to uncovering profitable trading opportunities. That said, Halvorsen isn't just about bullish bets. While long positions are Viking Global's bread and butter, the firm has also employed strategies that allow it to profit from short positions during turbulent market years like 2020 and 2022. The billionaire firmly believes that effective and profitable trading requires careful analysis and disciplined, long-term valuation. This philosophy has shaped Viking Global's portfolio into a balanced mix of both long-term and short-term investments. While his primary focus remains on long-term stakes in public and private companies, Halvorsen isn’t afraid to embrace "thoughtful risk-taking" to maximize returns. This balanced approach, combining strategic risk with a commitment to disciplined analysis, is at the heart of Viking Global’s success. This year, Viking’s funds have been making a strong comeback. Its hybrid fund, Viking Global Opportunities, which invests in both public stocks and private companies, earned a modest 1% return in the third quarter, trimming its year-to-date losses to 1.6%. Meanwhile, its private-asset fund, Viking Global Opportunities Drawdown, gained 4.2% for the quarter, bringing its total return for the year to 8.3%. After a rough second quarter, these results show Viking is back on track and making waves in the investment world. Overall, as of Q3 2024, Halvorsen’s 13F portfolio reflects a strong focus on the healthcare, finance, services, and technology sectors. The portfolio's total value stands at over $27.43 billion, marking a 1.05% increase compared to the previous quarter. For this analysis, we examined Viking Global's stock portfolio from the third quarter of 2024. The stocks are ranked based on the firm’s stake value in each holding. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers. Viking Global's Q3 Stake: $1.13 billion Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 158 Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), renowned for its iconic iPhone, Mac computers, and iPads, also derives significant revenue from its services segment, which includes Apple Pay, the App Store, Apple Music, and iCloud. On October 31, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) announced a record fourth-quarter revenue of $94.9 billion, a 6% increase from the previous year, fueled by strong demand for the iPhone 16 series, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4. The company is also gearing up for the release of its 18.2 software update, which will introduce a range of AI-powered features and is expected to roll out to users soon. Additionally, the tech giant is expanding its services into new markets, with the highly anticipated launch of Apple Intelligence in China marking a significant step in its global growth strategy. UBS analysts have adopted a cautiously optimistic stance on Apple’s iPhone 16, citing mixed demand signals and lukewarm interest in AI-related features, particularly outside of China. A UBS Evidence Lab survey revealed varying consumer sentiment across regions. In the U.S., purchase intent remained steady at 24%, while in China, it dipped to 17%, a 200-basis-point decline from 2023. However, Europe showed positive trends, with purchase intent rising in the U.K. by 200 basis points to 19% and in Germany by 300 basis points to 14%. Despite the tempered demand and skepticism toward AI features, UBS raised its global smartphone sell-in estimates to 1.21 billion units for 2024 and 1.24 billion units for 2025, indicating modest growth. On December 2, UBS maintained a $236 price target and a Neutral rating for AAPL shares, valuing the stock at 32 times its projected 2026 earnings per share of $7.49. In its third quarter 2024 investor letter, Madison Investments said the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL): “Alphabet Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Qualcomm Incorporated, Microsoft Corporation, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) were the largest detractors. Apple has been volatile in the last quarter but ended on strength. Early in the quarter, Apple benefited from the introduction of their AI strategy, Apple Intelligence. They followed in September with the new iPhone 16, which also created some excitement. We are underweight to Apple, which has resulted in a headwind for performance.” Overall, AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of Halvorsen's top stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of Norwegian Billionaire Halvorsen's Top 10 Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Spotify Technology S.A. (NYSE:SPOT) stands against Halvorsen's other top stock picks. Ole Andreas Halvorsen, the founder and CEO of Viking Global, has built one of the most respected names in the hedge fund world. Born in Norway, Halvorson graduated with an undergraduate degree in economics from Williams College in 1986. He then later earned a postgraduate business degree from Stanford University. Having received his first taste of finance while working for Morgan Stanley, he’s part of an elite group of investors known as the “Tiger Cubs,” former protégés of hedge fund legend Julian Robertson, who went on to launch their own successful firms. Viking Global, based in Greenwich, Connecticut, has grown into an investment powerhouse. Back in 2023, the firm delivered an impressive $6 billion in returns for its investors, ranking just behind heavyweights like Citadel and TCI. Much of this success came from smart bets on big names. In the same year, Halvorsen decided to reopen Viking Global's long/short flagship fund to new investors. Over a decade ago, he had closed the fund, citing its size as a barrier to uncovering profitable trading opportunities. That said, Halvorsen isn't just about bullish bets. While long positions are Viking Global's bread and butter, the firm has also employed strategies that allow it to profit from short positions during turbulent market years like 2020 and 2022. The billionaire firmly believes that effective and profitable trading requires careful analysis and disciplined, long-term valuation. This philosophy has shaped Viking Global's portfolio into a balanced mix of both long-term and short-term investments. While his primary focus remains on long-term stakes in public and private companies, Halvorsen isn’t afraid to embrace "thoughtful risk-taking" to maximize returns. This balanced approach, combining strategic risk with a commitment to disciplined analysis, is at the heart of Viking Global’s success. This year, Viking’s funds have been making a strong comeback. Its hybrid fund, Viking Global Opportunities, which invests in both public stocks and private companies, earned a modest 1% return in the third quarter, trimming its year-to-date losses to 1.6%. Meanwhile, its private-asset fund, Viking Global Opportunities Drawdown, gained 4.2% for the quarter, bringing its total return for the year to 8.3%. After a rough second quarter, these results show Viking is back on track and making waves in the investment world. Overall, as of Q3 2024, Halvorsen’s 13F portfolio reflects a strong focus on the healthcare, finance, services, and technology sectors. The portfolio's total value stands at over $27.43 billion, marking a 1.05% increase compared to the previous quarter. For this analysis, we examined Viking Global's stock portfolio from the third quarter of 2024. The stocks are ranked based on the firm’s stake value in each holding. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A person wearing headphones listening to an audio streaming service. Viking Global's Q3 Stake: $949.9 million Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 98 Headquartered in Luxembourg, Spotify Technology S.A. (NYSE:SPOT) is a digital music streaming leader, celebrated for revolutionizing the music industry. Departing from traditional revenue models based on album sales and live performances, Spotify compensates artists based on song streams, reshaping how music is monetized. In its efforts to expand its business model, Spotify Technology S.A. (NYSE:SPOT) recently launched the Spotify Partner Program, enabling creators to earn more from their audio and video content. The company also entered a partnership with Emirates, integrating Spotify's media offerings into the airline's in-flight entertainment system, further diversifying its reach. Spotify's third-quarter results showcased strong performance, with Monthly Active Users (MAUs) and Premium Subscribers aligning with market expectations. Revenue grew 18.5% year-over-year, reaching $16.8 billion, driven by an 11% increase in average revenue per user (ARPU) within the premium subscription segment. The platform added 14 million users, bringing its total user base to 640 million, and 6 million new subscribers, raising the total to 252 million. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, Spotify Technology S.A. (NYSE:SPOT) forecasts further growth, projecting MAUs to reach 665 million and Premium Subscribers to climb to 260 million. On December 2, Canaccord Genuity expressed continued confidence in Spotify Technology S.A. (NYSE:SPOT), raising its price target from $525 to $560. The firm's optimism reflects Spotify's strong November performance, where its stock surged approximately 24%, signaling sustained momentum and investor confidence in its growth trajectory. Overall, SPOT ranks 6th on our list of Halvorsen's top stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of SPOT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than SPOT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Is Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) The Best Plastics Stock To Invest In Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best Plastics Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against the other plastics stocks. The importance of plastics in modern society cannot be overstated. They play a vital role in various industries, including automotive, construction, food and beverage, and healthcare. Plastics are lightweight, durable, and versatile, making them essential for the production of a wide array of products that enhance our daily lives. Additionally, the plastics industry plays a crucial role in the global economy, contributing significantly to job creation and innovation. According to the Plastics Industry Association’s 2024 Size and Impact Report, the US plastics sector alone accounted for over 1 million jobs and generated $519.1 billion in shipments in 2023. This sector has shown resilience, with plastics manufacturing employment growing at a rate of 1.1% annually from 2013 to 2023, outpacing the overall manufacturing growth of 0.7% during the same period. READ ALSO: 10 Undervalued Chemical Stocks to Invest In and 7 Most Profitable Food Stocks To Invest In. Recent trends indicate a strong push towards sustainability within the plastics sector. Companies are increasingly investing in recycling technologies and circular economy initiatives to reduce waste and improve environmental outcomes. According to a report by The Business Research Company, the global plastic recycling market was valued at $41.71 billion in 2023. The market is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.1% during 2024-2028 to reach a value of $61.56 billion by the end of the forecast period. According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the production of plastic has been increasing rapidly since the 1970s, outpacing the growth of any other material. Global plastic production could reach 1,100 million tonnes by 2050. A significant portion of this plastic, around 36%, is used for packaging, including single-use items like food and beverage containers. Unfortunately, about 85% of these single-use plastics end up in landfills or as unmanaged waste, contributing to a growing environmental crisis. Demand for plastics is expected to remain high in the coming years. While limiting plastic production may seem beneficial for the environment, it could lead to unintended negative consequences for economies worldwide, particularly affecting those in developing regions that rely on affordable plastic products. The plastics industry is not only vital for economic stability but also plays a crucial role in addressing modern sustainability challenges. With ongoing investments in recycling and innovation, the plastics industry is expected to continue to thrive while adapting to changing consumer preferences and regulatory landscapes. To compile our list of the 8 best plastics stocks to invest in now, we looked for the largest plastics companies. We also reviewed our own rankings and consulted various online resources to compile a list of the best plastics stocks. From an initial pool of more than 20 plastics stocks, we focused on the top 8 stocks most favored by institutional investors. Data for the hedge fund sentiment surrounding each stock was taken from Insider Monkey’s Q3 2024 database of 900 elite hedge funds. The 8 best plastics stocks to invest in now are ranked in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them as of Q3 2024. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). YAKOBCHUK VIACHESLAV/Shutterstock.com Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 86 Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is an American multinational oil and gas corporation and one of the largest integrated fuels, lubricants, and chemical companies in the world. The company is also a major producer of a variety of advanced plastics, including polypropylene and polyethylene. The company is making significant strides in the field of advanced recycling, which positions it as a promising investment opportunity for those interested in plastics. On November 21, 2024, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) announced a substantial investment of over $200 million to enhance its advanced recycling operations at its facilities in Baytown and Beaumont, Texas. This expansion will enhance the company’s ability to recycle hard-to-process plastics and divert them from landfills. The advanced recycling process transforms plastic waste into raw materials for various products, including fuels and high-performance plastics and chemicals. This method can handle types of plastic that traditional recycling cannot, helping to reduce waste and support a circular economy for plastics. With this investment, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) will boost its annual recycling capacity to 500 million pounds, moving closer to its goal of reaching 1 billion pounds per year by 2027. Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) is also developing additional recycling projects across North America, Europe, and Asia. The company has advanced recycling customers in over 15 countries across various sectors, such as food-safe packaging and pet food, where demand is growing. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is also advancing its technology-driven businesses, particularly with its innovative Proxxima thermoset resin. This new material is not only stronger and lighter than traditional options, but it also boasts superior corrosion resistance. Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) estimates that the total addressable market for Proxxima could reach 5 million tons per year and a potential market value of $30 billion by 2030. Exxon Mobil Corporation’s (NYSE:XOM) strong market presence, combined with its strategic investments in advanced materials, positions it as a strong stock to consider for investors looking for growth in the plastics and materials sector. Overall, XOM ranks 1st on our list of the best plastics stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential of XOM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Neil Doak previously served as an assistant coach with Georgia. Former Ulster coach Neil Doak has been appointed as head coach of the Ireland U-20s for the 2025 Six Nations. The experienced former scrum-half was part of the ticket under Willie Faloon for this year’s World Cup in South Africa and now steps up to the top job. Doak will be assisted by former Connacht and Munster out-half Ian Keatley, ex-Connacht second row Andrew Browne and Blackrock College scrum guru Seamus Toomey who has been linked with a set-piece role with the IRFU. Ireland open their campaign against England in Cork and will warm up with a game against Italy on Friday week in St Mary’s RFC and against a Leinster Development XV on January 4. “It is a huge honour to take on the role of Ireland Men’s U-20s head coach, and a challenge I am massively excited about,” he said. "We have had a number of camps in the High Performance Centre and the application, hard work and commitment of the players has been really impressive. “We have a lot of work to get through in preparation for the U20 Six Nations, but the group are focused on building positively day-by-day and the upcoming matches against Italy and the Leinster Development XV over the Christmas and New Year period present us with an invaluable opportunity to build that cohesion and momentum. “We look forward to the challenges ahead, starting off with the visit of England to Virgin Media Park, where the Ireland U20s have received incredible support from the people of Cork in recent years, and we are determined to continue our excellent home record there and produce a performance we can be proud of.” Doak played cricket for Ireland at the same time as enjoying a career as a scrum-half for Ulster, before becoming a noted attack coach with his home province where he served as interim head coach while Les Kiss was still with Ireland, while he worked for Worcester Warriors between 2018 and 2020. He was part of Kiss’s coaching ticket for Ireland’s 2013 summer tour of the United States and Canada and has also worked at international level with Emerging Ireland in 2014 and Georgia in 2020 when he worked alongside IRFU performance director David Humphreys. In recent years, he’s been working in Ulster’s academy.

Title: Microsoft shareholders say NO to Bitcoin amid volatility concerns
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/microsoft-shareholders-say-no-to-bitcoin-amid-volatility-concerns/
Time Published: 2024-12-11T14:00:59Z
Full Content:
Could Bitcoin’s volatility outweigh its potential as a hedge against inflation? Microsoft shareholders have rejected a proposal to invest in Bitcoin [BTC], despite predictions of significant market growth. The proposal was led by MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor, who called for Microsoft to diversify its portfolio by allocating a portion of its reserves to Bitcoin. Saylor highlighted BTC’s position as the seventh-largest global asset, with its market capitalization expected to surpass $2 trillion shortly and potentially reach over $200 trillion by 2045. However, concerns over volatility led to the board’s decision, supported by major institutional investors like Vanguard and BlackRock. Instead, Microsoft is focusing on AI innovation and is cautious about cryptocurrency investments, underscoring a strategic shift away from digital assets in favor of cutting-edge technological advancements. Remarking on the same, Satya Nadella, Chairman and CEO said in a proxy statement, “AI is one of the most transformative technologies of our time, and we believe it will fundamentally bend the productivity curve for every individual, organization, and industry sector to help us address some of our most pressing global challenges.” Nadella added, “We know Microsoft will only succeed if the world is fundamentally succeeding. We are focused on ensuring the world benefits from the broad technological shift to AI, while mitigating its risks.” The proposal, suggested by the National Center for Public Policy Research, recommended allocating 1% of Microsoft’s assets, approximately $784 million, to BTC as a hedge against inflation. Despite the proposal’s innovative approach, concerns over Bitcoin’s volatility and potential risks to financial stability led to the board’s decision. Institutional investors like Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street, who collectively own about 70% of Microsoft shares, supported the board’s position, balancing a cautious view with their broader crypto interests. This highlights that Microsoft’s focus remains on stability, with a preference for predictability over risk. BTC’s volatility, substantial market fluctuations, and the risk of significant losses—such as its 70% decline in 2022—may have influenced Microsoft’s decision to reject the proposal. Additionally, the strategic use of cash flows to support operations and future investments is critical, and liquidating Bitcoin during market downturns could lead to losses. Furthermore, ongoing regulatory uncertainty around cryptocurrencies adds an extra layer of complexity. As a result, Microsoft remains focused on low-risk assets like treasury bonds to maintain long-term stability and sustainable growth. As expected, Microsoft’s decision to reject BTC investment faced significant criticism and sarcasm from the crypto community, as highlighted by Bitcoin Archive in its recent X post. Source: Bitcoin Archive/X Saylor too jumped in and said, “In 5 years, they’ll understand. Everyone buys Bitcoin at the price they deserve.#BTC doesn’t wait. It simply transfers wealth to those who see.” Despite this, several supporters came to Microsoft’s defense, emphasizing the company’s focus on long-term stability and strategic caution.

Israel has the right idea. Break all their shit, and then contain them within their borders. That’s all we should ever do. Biden dragged us into the Ukraine war, so why not Syria? Gaaaaaa! If she is to be offered for marriage at the bazaar, the seller would have to include a herd of camels and goats to get a taker. It might work though since with a face like that she can pass for a camel. Oh man. The left and the anti-war crowd is dying to get the U.S. actively involved in another war so that they can be outraged at Trump’s war. Maybe the deep state already has a false flag in the works.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Self-Driving Technology Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stands against other best self-driving technology stocks to buy according to hedge funds. The autonomous driving industry is, along with machine learning and image processing, one of the earliest adopters of artificial intelligence. While the post-2022 hype surrounding AI has led to the technology catching the general public’s attention, what ChatGPT debuted was a subset of AI called generative artificial intelligence. Other forms of AI, such as machine learning, have been employed for far longer, and as we alluded to above, one form is autonomous driving. Autonomous driving uses machine learning to compute data gathered through sensors or cameras on a car. The machine learning algorithms are trained using vast amounts of data already gathered. Several firms already have working autonomous driving platforms. These include Elon Musk’s car company, Google Waymo, and GM’s Cruise platform. Yet, even though all of them are autonomous driving platforms, they also represent a key division in the industry. Before we get to the biggest controversy in the autonomous driving industry, it’s important to first get a sense of the industry’s value. According to research from Mordor Intelligence, as of 2024, the industry is worth a cool $41 billion. By 2029, the firm expects it to touch $144 billion by growing at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22.75%. Analysts believe that one of the biggest drivers of the autonomy industry will be autonomous ridesharing. As per McKinsey, 56% of consumers surveyed in 2022 indicated that they would be willing to share self-driving vehicles provided that they did not increase travel time and cut down costs by 20%. The respondents also wanted Level 4 autonomy in their future cars, which indicates that the market for self-driving vehicles exists among consumers. But what about businesses? After all, the corporate sector only invests in technologies if it’s confident about making a return and generating operating efficiencies. On this front, additional research from McKinsey shows that self-driving vehicle software could post margins of up to 15% while hardware could have margins of 10%. Autonomous vehicle services create margins of 14%, believes the research firm, as it adds that 96% of businesses surveyed “saw strategic partnerships as crucial to autonomous-vehicle development, and more than half (56 percent) thought the relationship between OEMs and end users (such as logistics carriers) is already changing.” Cycling back to the division in the autonomous driving industry, this has divided the sector between using cameras to gather visual data or using LiDAR sensors instead. On the former front, Elon Musk created quite a bit of turmoil in 2019 when he announced that firms that use LiDAR for autonomous driving were unwise. Musk persisted with his opinion in a later interview given at an Axel Springer event. He explained that: “We believe just cameras are the way to go. We don’t use LiDAR at all. The entire road network is designed for passive optical, it’s essentially vision. So, in order to make a car drive properly, you have to solve vision. And, at the point at which you solve vision, you really don’t need any other instruments. Like a careful driver, a human driver can drive with an extremely good track record. Unlike a human, the computer does not get tired. It has 360 degree surround cameras. It’s got three cameras pointing forward. So it’s like being able to see with the eyes in the back of the head. So it’s really, vision is the way to go. There’s some value to active optical for wavelength that’s occlusion penetrating. So it can see through fog, or rain, or dust. But it. has to be high resolution. Such that you can rely on, for example radar at roughly four millimeter wavelength. This is good for occlusion penetration. But it needs to have enough resolution to know you braking for a real object and not just a bridge, or a manhole cover, or something like that.” However, while Musk is convinced that LiDAR isn’t worthwhile for autonomous driving, executives at Google’s Waymo business beg to differ. At a developer event in 2019, Waymo’s Principal Scientist Drago Anguelov commented “You can imagine doing driving just with cameras, but you would need the best camera systems to really handle it. So that’s a very big bet that you can achieve it. And it’s very, very risky, and it’s not necessary.” He added that his firm had better data courtesy of LiDAR which helps it “build the right simulation environments.” CTO Dmitri Dolgov shared that using LiDAR was “all about taking the best of both worlds and combining them in an intelligible way to have the most capable and the safest system that you can have.” So, while Musk and the autonomous driving industry battle it out, we decided to look at which autonomous driving stocks hedge funds are piling into. The industry hasn’t performed too well in 2024 as a broader automotive and EV slowdown has meant that orders for self-driving equipment providers have slowed down. The slowdown has led to some stocks losing as much as 58% year-to-date, and as you read on, you’ll understand why. For our list of the best self-driving technology stocks, we ranked the holdings of Global X’s autonomy ETF with significant exposure to autonomous driving by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares during Q3 2024 and picked out the top stocks. For an alternative list that focuses on the best autonomous driving car companies, please visit 10 Best Autonomous Driving Stocks to Buy. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Investors In Q3 2024: 99 Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is a leading player in the autonomous driving industry and one of the hottest firms in the sector. Its FSD assisted driving platform is among the industry leaders in America, and FSD’s success is also baked into the firm’s hypothesis. Through FSD and its Cybercabs, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) aims to unlock new markets and diversify away from being an EV manufacturer. Consequently, the firm has to deliver on these fronts or see trouble with the share price as was evident in October after the stock fell by 9% after Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s Cybercab event failed to impress investors with the specifics. However, the stock is up by a whopping 52% since the November election due to CEO Elon Musk’s proximity with President-elect Donald Trump and the market’s belief that this can generate positive catalysts for Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). The firm also benefits from having 1.3 billion miles of data to train autonomous systems and computing resources to crunch its algorithms. Baron Funds mentioned Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: “As discussed in the Fund’s prior shareholder letter, the fears about Tesla’s products were misplaced. Instead of the company being exclusively dependent on limited vehicle models and software advancement, the company announced it will more rapidly introduce products that appeal to a wider audience. It also demonstrated that its price reductions were the result of efficiencies rather than only to spur demand. Margins exceeded expectations. And the company’s integration of its hardware with proprietary AI software should facilitate full self-driving capabilities and subsequent new revenue streams. This integration of hardware with software creates a dynamic growth company as it more fully explores its potential with Optimus, humanoid robotics. The combination of these catalysts resulted in Tesla’s stock increasing meaningfully and rapidly in the second half of the quarter. This stock price momentum has continued into the next period.” Overall, TSLA ranks 3rd on our list of best self-driving technology stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of TSLA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TSLA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Is First Citizens BancShares (FCNCA) the Best Bank Stock to Invest in for the Long Term?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Bank Stocks To Invest In For the Long Term. In this article, we are going to take a look at where First Citizens BancShares, Inc. (NASDAQ:FCNCA) stands against other best bank stocks to invest in for the long term. Following the 2024 US presidential election, the banking industry has generated quite a lot of returns on the stock market. Bank stocks are dependent on interest rates, the lending environment, and the costs they incur. While higher rates mean that banks can increase their spread and boost interest earnings, if the rates remain high for too long, then the demand for capital dries up in the industry which affects the amount of money they can lend. Additionally, higher rates also mean that for some banks, particularly those geared towards consumers, interest expenses also jump since they have to pay out hefty amounts to account holders. The high interest costs experienced by these banks don’t mean that those focused on investment banking are spared the ire of high rates. Investment banks suffer from reduced market activity during periods of high interest rates since most investors prefer the comfort of deposit accounts and other vehicles to enjoy risk-free interest income. These principles have been evident on the balance sheets of some of the biggest banks in America during the Federal Reserve’s latest interest rate hiking cycle. As an example, consider the H1 2024 results of America’s second-largest bank by asset size. For the six months ending in June 2023, the bank earned $61 billion in interest income. This marked a strong 118% annual growth as the bank basked in the two-decade-high interest rate era in the United States. At the same time, however, the firm’s interest expenses sat at $32.4 billion to mark an even greater 731% annual jump. As a result, while pre-expense interest income grew by triple-digit percentages, after accounting for interest expense, the net interest income marked a 19% growth and was $28.6 billion. Similarly, higher rates also mean that banks focused on investment markets end up struggling. This has been the case for America’s fifth-largest bank by asset size. While Wall Street in 2023 and 2024 has seen broader indexes driven by investors’ AI euphoria, in 2022, the markets faced one of their worst years in recent history. Back then, the Federal Reserve unleashed back-to-back 75 basis point interest rate hikes, and most stocks that were not geared to withstand the new economic conditions ushered by the high rates stumbled. From the start of 2022 to the market’s bottom in October, the flagship S&P index had lost 24.8% while the broader NASDAQ’s technology focus meant that it lost a heftier 34%. Naturally, the fifth largest bank in America which derived 61% of its noninterest revenue from market-making and investment banking operations as of H1 2024 didn’t thrive in this environment. During H1 2022, its investment banking income dropped by 44% to $3.9 billion since it was accompanied by an even sharper drop of 49% for the second quarter. For the full year, the bank recorded a 95% drop in its 2021 ‘Other principal transaction’ revenue of $11.6 billion. This line item included revenue from its “equity investing activities, including revenues related to our consolidated investments (included in Asset & Wealth Management), and debt investing and lending activities (included across our three segments).” During the Q4 2022 earnings call, management commented on the tough year. CEO David Solomon shared how while his firm was eager to cut costs, it had to ensure that it kept up with competitors in retaining talent. The bank’s stock fell by 6% in early trading following the earnings as investors were spooked by the fact that operating expenses jumped by 11% at a time when revenue fell by 16% and profit dropped by a painful 66%. Back then, Solomon also shared how high rates and a tight economy had made things difficult for his firm: “Simply said, our quarter was disappointing and our business mix proved particularly challenging. These results are not what we aspire to deliver to shareholders. We generated revenues of $10.6 billion and net earnings of $1.3 billion and earnings per share of $3.32. After nine straight quarters of double-digit returns, fourth quarter performance was certainly an outlier. Results were impacted by several near-term challenges given the difficult operating environment. On the revenue front, underwriting volumes remained extremely muted despite green shoots that appeared at the end of the third quarter. While the incoming Trump administration’s perceived business friendliness and its effects on the economy are one reason the S&P’s bank stock index jumped by 12% after the elections, another reason is regulations. Investors believe that the incoming administration will not be as strict with the big banks. Heading into the elections, regulations were at the forefront of the industry’s concerns as we discussed in our coverage of 10 Best Diversified Bank Stocks to Buy Now. Now, banks are hoping that Basel III Endgame, fair lending rules, heads of regulatory bodies, and private lending are some areas that the new administration might provide them some relief with. To make our list of the best bank stocks to buy for the long term, we first ranked all US-traded bank stocks by their market capitalization. Out of these, the 40 most valuable stocks in terms of market capitalization were re-ranked by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A financial advisor and their client discussing the merits of wealth management services. Number of Hedge Fund Investors In Q3 2024: 46 First Citizens BancShares, Inc. (NASDAQ:FCNCA) is a regional bank based in North Carolina. As was the case with the broader banking sector, its shares soared by 18% after the November election. The stock is up 53% year-to-date as it enjoys tailwinds from First Citizens BancShares, Inc. (NASDAQ:FCNCA)’s prudent moves during the 2023 mini-crisis in the banking industry. The firm used this opportunity to buy Silicon Valley Bank and add a large set of customers to its portfolio. However, the share price growth means that First Citizens BancShares, Inc. (NASDAQ:FCNCA) is trading at 42% over its book-value-per-share, which creates questions about whether the stock can appreciate further or if future growth is already priced into the shares. The bank’s decision to buy SVB’s assets also means that in a low interest rate era that stimulates venture capital activity, First Citizens BancShares, Inc. (NASDAQ:FCNCA) can see greater tailwinds from SVB’s presence in the technology industry. During the Q3 2024 earnings call, First Citizens BancShares, Inc. (NASDAQ:FCNCA)’s management shared details about what might happen in the venture capital market as rates come down: “So recognizing we’re not providing preliminary guidance on ‘25 at this point, there continues to be a substantial amount of dry powder, capital that’s been committed to venture capital, general partners that has yet to be invested. I think the stat for the third quarter is something like $328 billion or something like that. So a lot of money on the sidelines waiting to be invested. We’ve just seen the first 50 basis point rate cut with the expectation of potentially more. And that we believe that I think Craig said in his opening remarks, we hope we’ll begin to unstick this market, right? That things will continue to thaw and given that we’re now nine, 10 quarters in to what has been a very significant downturn in the innovation economy space. And so while I can’t predict the future and nobody knows exactly when that investment activity will pick back up, I think again, we remain well positioned for that inevitability when it occurs.” Overall, FCNCA ranks 8th on our list of best bank stocks to invest in for the long term. While we acknowledge the potential of FCNCA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than FCNCA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

By David French, Andres Gonzalez and Davide Barbuscia NEW YORK (Reuters) - A dealmaking splurge by BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) in 2024 may continue as the world's largest asset manager is expected to opportunistically look to further expand in private credit, real estate, infrastructure or possibly private equity. New York-based BlackRock announced last week plans to buy private credit firm HPS Investment Partners for about $12 billion in a deal that BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said will allow the companies to offer an integration of private and public market investment products. It was BlackRock's third major acquisition this year. Looking ahead, BlackRock could bolster its presence in private markets through further acquisitions, financial sources and analysts said. Targets could include an expansion in private credit or bulking up in private equity, positioning BlackRock to better compete with larger players in alternative investments. "They look at everything," said Daniel Fannon, an analyst at Jefferies who covers BlackRock. "They are canvassing the market for appropriate partners and asset classes that they are relevant in." BlackRock spent roughly $28 billion in 2024 to strengthen its private market offerings, a strategic move that Fink views as key to positioning the firm as a conduit for private capital into global infrastructure projects at a time of tightening government budgets and rising public debt. Private credit, which involves non-bank institutions providing loans to companies, has experienced significant growth in recent years due to stricter regulations that have increased the cost for traditional banks to fund higher-risk loans. In October, BlackRock finalized its $12.5 billion acquisition of investment firm Global Infrastructure Partners and anticipates completing a $3.2 billion purchase of private markets data provider Preqin by year-end. The HPS deal will create a private credit franchise with about $220 billion in client assets. Rival alternative asset manager Ares Management (NYSE:ARES) had approximately $313.6 billion in private credit assets under management as of Sept. 30. Blackstone (NYSE:BX)'s overall credit business is about $432 billion, the bulk of it in private credit, the firm says. BlackRock may continue expanding in infrastructure and private credit, said a source involved in the HPS deal, potentially targeting smaller, complementary acquisitions to enhance its offerings. "BlackRock has made a very loud statement that they want to be much bigger in private credit and in infrastructure within private markets," said Alexander Blostein, a senior analyst at Goldman Sachs who covers BlackRock. A further push into private assets could also include buying an asset to give BlackRock exposure to real estate - albeit once the commercial market has stabilized, said one senior investment banker. BlackRock's alternative assets under management — including private debt and equity — totaled approximately $320 billion as of the end of September, less than 3% of its $11.5 trillion in assets. BlackRock's alternative assets are dwarfed by its holdings in low-fee products like index funds and ETFs. Considering BlackRock's size, recent acquisitions seem to hold greater strategic importance than asset management, suggesting additional ventures into private markets are possible, said Cathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research. "We've always thought of making organic and inorganic investments in our business," BlackRock's chief financial officer, Martin Small, said during the company's third-quarter earnings call in October. "Inorganic is a tool that we have in order to optimize organic growth, but we don't need M&A to meet our organic growth targets," he said then. BlackRock declined to comment for this story. PRIVATE EQUITY Private equity could be another avenue for expansion, said a source familiar with the matter and the senior investment banker. BlackRock has had informal conversations with private equity firms in the past, but none have progressed beyond preliminary stages, the banker said. BlackRock's acquisitions have been relatively "opportunistic" this year, said the same banker, suggesting BlackRock could soon be chasing new targets if the circumstances are advantageous. Private equity, however, may be less of an immediate focus given that the industry has struggled in recent years. "It's just a much tougher part of the business," said Greggory Warren, a strategist at Morningstar. Asked about a potential expansion in private equity, BlackRock’s chief operating officer, Rob Goldstein, said on Tuesday that the firm already has private equity capabilities. “For the time being, when we look at where the puck is going and we look at where clients are increasingly focused and find allocations, we prioritize both infrastructure, that's debt and equity, as well as private credit,” he said on a panel at the Reuters NEXT conference in New York. BlackRock's private equity teams manage $42 billion in capital commitments, trailing industry heavyweights such as Blackstone, which oversees $345 billion in private equity assets, and KKR, with $190 billion as of the end of September. "BlackRock doesn't have quite as much (private equity) as Blackstone and KKR, but I think they're more interested in backfilling other parts of the business," said Warren. Growing its secondaries business through an acquisition would be one way to advance its private equity exposure, with focus on one of its hottest sectors, said the senior investment banker. Total (EPA:TTEF) transaction volume in the market, where owners of stakes in private equity funds can sell them to other investors before the fund matures, is expected to hit a record-breaking $140 billion this year, according to BlackRock's own website. To be sure, the company may need to take a breather after this year's acquisition surge. "I imagine they'll digest some of the recent acquisitions, then the focus turns to upcoming fundraising, product creation, sales and distribution," said Benjamin Budish, an analyst at Barclays (LON:BARC). For Mac Sykes, portfolio manager for BlackRock investor Gabelli Funds, HPS was not BlackRock's last foray into acquisitions but the company is under no pressure to do more deals. "I see them as being opportunistic with a high bar. They are smart capital allocators," Sykes said.

Title: What's New With BlackRock Stock?

Time Published: 2024-12-11T10:00:15Z
Full Content:
The BlackRock logo appears on the screen of a smartphone in Reno, United States, on December 10, ... [+] 2024. (Photo Illustration by Jaque Silva/NurPhoto via Getty Images) BlackRock’s stock (NYSE: BLK) has gained roughly 32% year-to-date, as compared to the 28% rise in the S&P500 index over the same period. In comparison, BlackRock’s peer State Street’s stock (NYSE: STT) is up 31% year-to-date. The performance of BlackRock stock over the last few years has been mixed. Returns for the stock were 29% in 2021, -20% in 2022, and 18% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, what’s happening with BlackRock stock, and what lies ahead? Blackrock’s Q3 results were better than expected. While revenue stood at $5.2 billion, up 15% compared to last year, net income came in at $1.63 billion up 1.7% year-over-year. Growth was mainly driven by the positive impact of the markets, organic base fee growth, as well as higher performance fees. The company’s average assets under management increased by $2.4 trillion year-over-year to $11.5 trillion driven by $456 billion in net inflows as well as higher asset valuations. The company’s margins have also been picking up. Operating margins rose 350 basis points to 45.8%. Margins growth is being driven by a couple of factors. BlackRock is seeing a higher mix of higher-margin, higher-fee products including alternative investments which have higher fees. Moreover, flows toward exchange-traded funds have also been rising. While fees on these products are low, they are highly scalable, meaning that as AUMs grow, BlackRock’s incremental costs grow at a slower pace. BlackRock has also been steadily pushing into the private markets this year. In January, the company announced a deal to acquire Global Infrastructure Partners for about $12.5 billion, followed by a June announcement to buy Preqin, a leading private-markets data provider, for $3.2 billion. Earlier this month, it announced plans to acquire HPS Investment Partners, a private credit manager, in an all-stock deal valued at about $12 billion. This deal is expected to add approximately $850 million in base fees for 2025. The push into private markets is crucial for BlackRock, as the ETF space it dominates has become increasingly competitive with limited scope to increase fees. On the other hand, in the private assets space, the company can charge higher fees to clients, who are institutional investors and wealthy individuals. This move also helps BlackRock diversify and reduce its exposure to the volatility of public equity markets. Moreover, BlackRock’s existing clients including pension funds, endowments, and sovereign wealth funds are increasingly allocating capital to private markets to meet their long-term return expectations. We estimate BlackRock’s valuation at about $913 per share, slightly below the current market price. See our analysis of BlackRock’s valuation for a closer look at what’s driving the stock.

Title: AI can help India leapfrog and close the gap with large economies, says Blackrock’s Ben Powell

India can close the gap with large economies by harnessing AI-driven innovations, companies investing in AI infrastructure and productivity gains. Here are excerpts from an email interview with Powell, who is responsible for delivering value added market and investment insights across asset classes in the APAC region. Just like the rest of the world, India could experience rapid transformation due to artificial intelligence. We see three keyways in which AI could boost India’s economic development. First, and potentially most transformational, AI could innovate the way that economies innovate – possibly accelerating the pace of major scientific breakthroughs. That will likely be where the biggest productivity benefits could be seen. The speed at which India can harness these innovations will determine how quickly it can close the gap with large, developed economies. Second, for India to take full advantage of AI-driven opportunities, it will need to continue investing in AI infrastructure – including local data centers and energy – and in adoption of AI within companies. That will require further development of India’s capital markets to ensure a sufficient flow of credit. Third, India may have a double advantage in terms of its potential to grow economic output in coming years: not only because AI could deliver productivity gains but also because its labour force will continue to grow rapidly thanks to its young population. That’s in contrast to many developed economies and China, where AI may deliver productivity gains but among a workforce that is shrinking due to an aging population. AI will likely change the structure of economies, shifting how and where labour is deployed – and entirely new industries could be created that we can’t yet even imagine. This applies in India as elsewhere. India also offers strong long-term potential, in our view, even if near-term valuations appear elevated. India’s rapid growth rate, outstripping the emerging market average and surpassing China’s, underscores its economic ascent, albeit with some challenges ahead. We believe structural shifts underway in India map neatly onto the five mega forces we see shaping the world now and, in the future, – and provide a glimpse into sectoral and geographical opportunities. The dynamics at play in India are an example, in our view, of the impact of the mega forces we see as drivers of the new regime. Supercharged digitization that has revolutionized financial transactions, favourable demographics and India’s relative success in navigating a geopolitically fragmented world brighten the long-term outlook, we think. The rise of artificial intelligence is a prime example, reshaping economic trajectories. It’s no longer about short-term fluctuations in activity leading to expansion or recession. The ongoing outsized response of long-term assets to short-term news shows how unusual this environment is. As we head into 2025, some countries have new leaders with a mandate for political and economic change. That could see policymakers pursuing measures that add to volatility rather than stability. Our key investment themes to navigate markets in 2025 are as follows: First, harnessing capital markets to drive the region’s push into infrastructure and green technologies. Second, adopting more dynamic portfolio strategies to navigate economic divergences across countries with greater granularity. And third, remain pro-risk and stay nimble. Asia-Pacific is at the forefront of global transformation and is well positioned to navigate mega forces like the rise of AI, geopolitical fragmentation, demographic shifts and the low-carbon transition. APAC’s potential aligns with our key investment themes for 2025. This includes markets such as Japan and China. We are overweight Japan equities as structural reforms are gaining traction supporting our positive view tactically and an above-benchmark allocation to Japanese equities in long-term asset allocations. And China where we see tactical opportunities even as broader, structural challenges persist.​ We are modestly overweight Chinese equities as stocks are at attractive valuations to DM shares, yet we stand ready to pivot if future stimulus announcements disappoint. Strategically, we see opportunities in EMs at the cross current of mega forces – like India and Saudi Arabia. As we write in the piece, we think AI has the potential to radically reshape economies and markets. In coming years, AI’s adoption will vary across sectors. Initially, it could be most helpful in industries like healthcare, financial services, and communication services, where it can reshape operations and drive growth. Recent research by OpenAI researchers suggests up to 80 per cent of workers may use AI for some tasks, and as with the information and communication technology (ICT) revolution, entirely new jobs are also likely to emerge. The long-run effects are much less predictable. Much like the industrial revolution shifted workers from agriculture to manufacturing, AI may transform today’s workforce. The ICT revolution similarly required widespread reskilling, and AI could follow suit, or be even more transformative – this is the mass production of intelligence itself. AI could transform scientific research, driving advancements in biology, chemistry, and materials science. AI could also be embodied in physical systems, including autonomous vehicles, drones, humanoids, and augmented reality. Some have raised questions around AI overinvestment and those questions are valid, but the payoff will likely come over the next decade – not in the next year or two. Comparisons with the dot com bubble fall short, in our view: The dot-com era was marked by declining earnings quality, deteriorating capital efficiency and inflated valuations. Many of these indicators had gotten considerably ahead of historical norms, signaling trouble. Today’s landscape tells a different story. Unlike the dot-com era, robust earnings support today’s mega-cap valuations. These are indeed challenges we should be aware of. But the models so far have been around for relatively little time and have shown remarkable improvement. Even working the technology that currently exists into processes can bring large benefits. Yet it will take time. Census Bureau surveys show only about 5 per cent of U.S. companies are currently using AI. Limits might mean that we always need to combine quantitative (AI-driven insights) and qualitative (expert human judgment) approaches. Different models/companies might try to design algorithms that explicitly account for and correct biases, such as through adversarial debiasing or reweighting techniques. Novel and promising solutions include utilizing synthetic data, or smaller models specifically trained and tested for reasoning in a specific area.

Title: BlackRock CFO Martin Small outlines the asset management giant's top 3 criteria for every acquisition

BlackRock is spending top dollar in its quest to dominate private-markets investing, recently agreeing to buy private-credit firm HPS Investment Partners for $12 billion. It's been a busy year with the asset management giant also buying data powerhouse Preqin and private-equity firm Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) for $3.2 billion and $12.5 billion, respectively, earlier this year. "Inorganic has always been a fundamental part of the BlackRock strategy," said Martin Small, the firm's chief financial officer, in an interview at the Goldman Sachs Financial Services Conference on Tuesday. BlackRock isn't afraid to take big swings. "We've never shied away from taking big bets," CEO Larry Fink said in an analyst call about the GIP acquisition last week. BlackRock, which oversees $11.5 trillion, is not new to transforming itself through deals. In 2009, it pushed into passive investing when it bought Barclays' asset-management business. The acquistion gave it iShares and helped it become the public markets juggernaut it is today. The firm has important criteria for its major acquisitions. At the New York City event, Small laid out the top three factors and how HPS met them. Small, an 18-year BlackRock veteran who is also the global head of corporate strategy, named cultural fit as his top priority. "We have to acquire the kind of people that are aligned to a 'One BlackRock' culture and mission," he said, referring to the firm's ethos of working collaboratively. Small was part of many meetings with HPS's executive team to test the waters. He said the cofounders shared important values with Fink and BlackRock President Rob Kapito. "We all speak the same language," he said. "They're founders. Larry Fink and Rob Kapito are founders. We're client-centered firms. We believe in scale, we believe in global." The three cofounders of HPS — Scott Kanick, Mike Patterson, and Scot French — will lead a new private financing solutions unit at BlackRock and join the firm's global executive committee. BlackRock only makes acquisitions that are additive in more ways than one. "We've been in all the businesses that we've acquired, whether it's private credit or infrastructure or SMA or options or whatever. We've done technology and data in the last year," Small said. "It's not just about new capabilities. It's about new capabilities that make the ones you have better." Combining BlackRock's existing private credit business with that of HPS will produce a diversified business with a broader reach. "HPS has been very active in kind of the upper-middle market in terms of direct lending, but also the junior capital solutions," Small said. "Our team has historically been active more in the middle market, kind of $75 million EBITDA borrower base. So there's an enrichment." "I also think that'll strengthen origination, our ability to do more transactions, meet borrowers where they are," he added. "You've got to be a credible operator on a consolidated basis of these businesses," Small said of acquisition targets. Given BlackRock's prowess, it takes a sizable acquisition to move the needle. HPS's $148 billion in client assets fits the bill. "We'll now have a $220 billion preform a private credit business at BlackRock so we'll be very scaled in that regard," he said. Jump to

Title: Oil Prices Inch Up on Hopes of a U.S. Rate Cut and China Stimulus Measures

More Info Crude oil prices began trade with a gain today as traders turned their attention to U.S. monetary policy and China’s latest move to accelerate growth through stimulus measures. At the time of writing Brent crude was trading at $72.57 per barrel, with West Texas Intermediate changing hands for $68.98 per barrel. The climb followed an announcement from Beijing that it would loosen its monetary policy to fuel economic growth although the lack of details on what this loosening would entail exactly limited oil’s gains. Additional support for oil prices came from Chinese import data, which showed that shipments of crude had inched up in November, for the first time in months. The increase was quite solid, too, at 14% from October to 11.81 million barrels daily. A U.S. oil inventory build as estimated by the American Petroleum Institute failed to reverse price gains, possibly because of its modest size of half a million barrels. At the same time, the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to next week announce a fresh rate cut, which would be bullish for oil prices as reflected in the anticipatory gain today. Before the Fed makes its next rate decision, however, all eyes will be on the latest consumer price index reading, due out at 8:30 am ET today. Preliminary estimates see the November CPI reading at 2.7%, which would be a slight increase on October’s 2.6%. Core inflation for November is seen at 3.3% on an annual basis—for the fourth month in a row. These figures might make a new rate cut decision a bit problematic but media reports suggest that market players overwhelmingly expect that decision. “The Fed should be in a position to move forward on the December rate cut, but [the final] CPI report now becomes another significant milestone in the policy-adjustment calculus,” the chief executive of global fixed income at BlackRock, Rick Rieder, said.

Alphabet spikes after Google announces 'breakthrough' quantum chipShares of Google's parent company Alphabet rose 6% on Tuesday, a day after the company hailed its latest quantum computing chip as a "breakthrough." On Monday, Alphabet revealed its "Willow" chip, which performed a computation in under five minutes that would take one of today's fastest supercomputers 10 septillion years — that's 1 followed by 25 zeros — Google said. South Korea's ex-defense minister attempts suicide; police raid presidential officeThe fallout from South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol's brief imposition of martial law continues amid reports of his office being raided and his former defense minister attempting suicide. Police reportedly searched the president's office on Wednesday as part of an investigation into the six-hour martial law declaration. Separately, ex-defense minister Kim Yong-hyun reportedly made an attempt on his own life in his eastern Seoul detention facility. China ramps up Wall Street meetings ahead of Trump inaugurationChinese Vice Premier He Lifeng has met with several U.S. finance executives in the last month as Beijing seeks to build relationships ahead of President-elect Donald Trump's planned tariffs on China. Some of the meetings are with top executives from Blackrock, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup. Dow notches fourth straight day of lossesU.S. markets fell on Tuesday as the S&P 500 lost 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.25%, with both indexes notching back-to-back losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined for a fourth day, slipping 0.35%. Asian markets were mixed, with most major indexes staying range-bound. [PRO] Trump's proposed tariffs could cause unintended consequences: BernsteinTrump's proposed tariffs could have unintended consequences for certain brands, such as negative sentiment from Chinese consumers that could hurt U.S. companies' sales in that country, Bernstein found. What is quantum computing, and how does it work? In classical computing, information is stored in bits. Each bit is either a one or zero. Quantum computing uses quantum bits or qubits which can be zero, one or something in between.If you thought that sounded like something out of the Marvel multiverse, you are not alone. Every time a company comes up with a quantum computing breakthrough, such as Alphabet's Willow chip, the million-dollar question is: "What can it be used for?" Will we see faster laptops, faster smartphones, or can quantum computing be used for artificial intelligence applications? Will we be able to say "Open the pod bay doors please, HAL?" to a quantum computer? Proponents of quantum computing claim it will be able to solve problems that current computers can't. The theory is that quantum computers will be able to process much larger volumes of data, leading to potential breakthroughs in areas like medicine, science and finance. Shares of Alphabet surged 6% on Tuesday, but could this enthusiasm be unfounded? After all, if there are currently no real world uses for quantum computing, the solution cannot be put to solving problems, let alone commercialized. In short, quantum computing needs to have a purpose. It needs a "ChatGPT moment", as an analyst told CNBC, where people can utilize the technology such as how the chatbot allowed the world to tangibly experience artificial intelligence. HAL may just have to wait a while. Which as fans of Stanley Kubrick's epic "2001: A Space Odyssey" might know, isn't necessarily a bad thing. — CNBC's Arjun Kharpal contributed to this report.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 11 Best NASDAQ Penny Stocks To Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to look at where CommScope Holding Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:COMM) stands against other best NASDAQ penny stocks to buy right now. The NASDAQ Stock Market is home to some of the world’s largest companies in the world and also hosts several hundred penny stocks. These companies must meet certain requirements to remain listed on the NASDAQ exchange, including the $1 per share minimum share price thresholds, revenue standards, and market capitalization thresholds. If a company fails to meet these requirements, it may receive noncompliance notifications and eventually be delisted. According to a report by Bloomberg, this year’s market rally has boosted many of the struggling stocks, helping some companies regain compliance with NASDAQ’s listing requirements. On December 3, Bloomberg reported that Fed Governor Christopher Waller, while addressing a conference in Washington, indicated that he is inclined to vote for a rate cut at the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting on December 17-18. However, Waller emphasized that his decision will depend on the economic data released before the meeting, particularly if it shows an unexpected uptick in inflation. According to Bloomberg, New York Fed President John Williams in a speech in New York said that the economy is continuing to look strong and inflation is likely moving down toward the Fed’s target. However, he emphasized that the path for monetary policy will be contingent upon incoming economic data. He underscored the uncertainty of the economic outlook, noting, “If we’ve learned anything over the past five years, it’s that the outlook remains highly uncertain.” READ ALSO: 10 Oil Stocks with Biggest Upside Potential According to Analysts and 7 Best Emerging Markets Stocks To Buy Now. In an interview with CNBC on November 15, Nicholas Colas, Co-founder of DataTrek Research, discussed his views on the US stocks and the potential of small caps. Colas recalled how U.S. stocks outperformed global markets during the first Trump administration. Colas acknowledged that current multiples are high, but he is optimistic and believes that multiples can hold or even rise, given the high level of confidence in the US market. Regarding small caps, Colas suggested that they are a great trade for the year-end. The Russell 2000, which tracks small-cap performance, has been flat and lagged significantly behind the S&P 500 over the past three years, and presents an amazing opportunity, given that it typically sees a 20% increase. This underperformance makes small caps reasonable holds for the longer term, as they are due for a rebound. While the broader market is showing signs of overvaluation, small-cap, and penny stocks have lagged significantly behind over the past few years, creating a compelling opportunity for investors.

Title: Is Carlisle Companies (CSL) the Best Plastics Stock to Invest in Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best Plastics Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Carlisle Companies Incorporated (NYSE:CSL) stands against the other plastics stocks. The importance of plastics in modern society cannot be overstated. They play a vital role in various industries, including automotive, construction, food and beverage, and healthcare. Plastics are lightweight, durable, and versatile, making them essential for the production of a wide array of products that enhance our daily lives. Additionally, the plastics industry plays a crucial role in the global economy, contributing significantly to job creation and innovation. According to the Plastics Industry Association’s 2024 Size and Impact Report, the US plastics sector alone accounted for over 1 million jobs and generated $519.1 billion in shipments in 2023. This sector has shown resilience, with plastics manufacturing employment growing at a rate of 1.1% annually from 2013 to 2023, outpacing the overall manufacturing growth of 0.7% during the same period. READ ALSO: 10 Undervalued Chemical Stocks to Invest In and 7 Most Profitable Food Stocks To Invest In. Recent trends indicate a strong push towards sustainability within the plastics sector. Companies are increasingly investing in recycling technologies and circular economy initiatives to reduce waste and improve environmental outcomes. According to a report by The Business Research Company, the global plastic recycling market was valued at $41.71 billion in 2023. The market is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.1% during 2024-2028 to reach a value of $61.56 billion by the end of the forecast period. According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the production of plastic has been increasing rapidly since the 1970s, outpacing the growth of any other material. Global plastic production could reach 1,100 million tonnes by 2050. A significant portion of this plastic, around 36%, is used for packaging, including single-use items like food and beverage containers. Unfortunately, about 85% of these single-use plastics end up in landfills or as unmanaged waste, contributing to a growing environmental crisis. Demand for plastics is expected to remain high in the coming years. While limiting plastic production may seem beneficial for the environment, it could lead to unintended negative consequences for economies worldwide, particularly affecting those in developing regions that rely on affordable plastic products. The plastics industry is not only vital for economic stability but also plays a crucial role in addressing modern sustainability challenges. With ongoing investments in recycling and innovation, the plastics industry is expected to continue to thrive while adapting to changing consumer preferences and regulatory landscapes. To compile our list of the 8 best plastics stocks to invest in now, we looked for the largest plastics companies. We also reviewed our own rankings and consulted various online resources to compile a list of the best plastics stocks. From an initial pool of more than 20 plastics stocks, we focused on the top 8 stocks most favored by institutional investors. Data for the hedge fund sentiment surrounding each stock was taken from Insider Monkey’s Q3 2024 database of 900 elite hedge funds. The 8 best plastics stocks to invest in now are ranked in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them as of Q3 2024. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

By integrating Plasti-Fab’s capabilities, Carlisle Companies Incorporated (NYSE:CSL) aims to strengthen its product offerings and fill geographic gaps in both the US and Canada.

Companies are increasingly investing in recycling technologies and circular economy initiatives to reduce waste and improve environmental outcomes. According to a report by The Business Research Company, the global plastic recycling market was valued at $41.71 billion in 2023. The market is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.1% during 2024-2028 to reach a value of $61.56 billion by the end of the forecast period. According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the production of plastic has been increasing rapidly since the 1970s, outpacing the growth of any other material. Global plastic production could reach 1,100 million tonnes by 2050. A significant portion of this plastic, around 36%, is used for packaging, including single-use items like food and beverage containers. Unfortunately, about 85% of these single-use plastics end up in landfills or as unmanaged waste, contributing to a growing environmental crisis. Demand for plastics is expected to remain high in the coming years. While limiting plastic production may seem beneficial for the environment, it could lead to unintended negative consequences for economies worldwide, particularly affecting those in developing regions that rely on affordable plastic products. The plastics industry is not only vital for economic stability but also plays a crucial role in addressing modern sustainability challenges. With ongoing investments in recycling and innovation, the plastics industry is expected to continue to thrive while adapting to changing consumer preferences and regulatory landscapes.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI News That Broke The Internet. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other AI stocks. Should original content contributors be paid every time large language models use their work? OpenAI CEO Sam Altman believes they should, much like Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) deals for college athletes, he said on Wednesday at the New York Times’ DealBook Summit. “I think we do need a new [standard] for how creators are going to get rewarded. We need to find new economic models where creators can have new revenue streams”. READ ALSO: 10 Buzzing AI Stocks Making Headlines and Top 10 AI News Stories For The Weekend Even though developing such an economic model will be complex, it is unclear how people getting paid for their original work could become a norm in the future even if it does. The news comes amidst ChatGPT, Altman’s AI chatbot, which has itself been under fire numerous times over the years over copyright infringement and unpermitted use of published articles. “A particular passion of mine has always been, can we figure out how to do micropayments where, if you generate a story in the style of [a writer, they] can opt into that ... and get paid for it.” Regardless of Altman’s company facing criticism over copyright infringement concerns and ethical debates surrounding its AI models, the company continues to push boundaries in AI innovation, introducing groundbreaking tools and features that redefine the tech landscape. In its latest, OpenAI has introduced its buzzy AI video-generation tool, Sora, on Monday, December 9th. Working similar to OpenAI’s image-generation AI tool, DALL-E, Sora will be able to develop a high-definition video clip each time a user types out a desired scene. The video generation tool will also be able to generate video clips inspired by still images and extend existing videos or fill in missing frames. As per OpenAI’s YouTube live stream, the tool will debut to U.S. users as well as to “most countries internationally” on Monday, December 9th. However, it also said that there is “no timeline” yet for launching the tool in Europe and the U.K., as well as some other countries. In October, the company closed its latest funding round with a valuation of $157 billion, securing $6.6 billion from a wide range of investment firms and major tech companies. All of the company’s strategic initiatives and funding are part of a thoughtful growth plan for OpenAI as the company competes with other strong AI startups such as Anthropic, Elon Musk’s xAI, and other tech giants. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where IonQ, Inc. (NYSE:IONQ) stands against the other quantum computing stocks. Quantum computing stocks are once again in focus after yesterday's major breakthrough announcement by one of the biggest players in this field. Investors have had high expectations from quantum computing firms for many years, but the technology has consistently failed to deliver on the promise. However, a deeper understanding of the tech behind quantum computing is required to fully understand the complexity of the issue. Quantum computers were theorized in the 1980s, but their development has been fraught with challenges due to the fragility of qubits. Unlike traditional computers that use binary bits, like ones and zeroes, quantum computers utilize quantum bits, or qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously due to superposition. Qubit fragility typically leads to higher error rates for quantum computers. Companies have tried to address qubit fragility through innovations — ranging from light particles to trapped ions, but few have been successful. However, latest breakthroughs in this field herald the arrival of quantum supremacy - a term used to explain the processing power of quantum computers compared to traditional ones. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy According to Analysts and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Since the latest breakthroughs showcase that quantum computers can accomplish tasks in minutes that would otherwise take ten septillion years - exceeding the age of the universe - it would be reasonable to assume that quantum computers can now move on from accomplishing mundane tasks like generating random numbers or solving specific mathematical problems, towards practical applications in drug discovery, artificial intelligence, and cryptography. This has huge implications for investors who are increasingly frustrated by the plateauing advancement in the field of AI and are actively exploring for emerging opportunities in the tech field that offer explosive growth potential along the same lines. Sylvia Jablonski, the CEO of Defiance ETFs, appeared on news platform CNBC earlier this year to highlight this. “The way I see markets today is the absolute fervor and interest in all things A.I. and A.I. is the tide that rises all boats. I think quantum is the next generation of A.I. You need it to process data and make changes in all of the sectors we have been talking about that A.I. has been impacting with drug discovery and curing diseases. Just as AI is powering progress in not just the computer industry, but in fields that adopt the use of AI, quantum computing will be used in processing data for sectors already being transformed by AI, such as drug discovery and curing diseases.” Read more about these developments by accessing 12 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Invest In and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. For this article, we selected quantum computing stocks by sifting through the holdings of popular quantum computing ETFs. The stocks listed below are also popular among hedge funds.

A quantum computer on a countertop in an engineering laboratory with a technician at work. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 17 IonQ, Inc. (NYSE:IONQ) engages in the development of general-purpose quantum computing systems in the United States. The surging investor interest in quantum computing has helped push the shares up by close to 200% year-to-date. It is one of the best quantum computing stocks to buy according to hedge funds as it offers pure exposure to the quantum industry and has demonstrated stronger commercial traction. For example, in the third quarter, the company posted a revenue of $12.4 million, up more than 102% year-on-year. This performance was driven by over $63 million in new bookings by the quantum computing firm, including a $54 million contract with the US Air Force Research Lab to develop networked quantum systems. The quantum computers marketed by the firm make use of trapped ion quantum computing technology. This offers high stability and connectivity between qubits. Unlike traditional computers, which use binary units to process data, qubits process the zeroes and ones of binary units simultaneously. This speeds up processing times. To put this into context, the latest Forte Enterprise system marketed by IonQ can process 34 billion scenarios simultaneously. IonQ has also been expanding partnerships with major companies to gain mainstream recognition. For example, the firm recently announced that it would partner with pharma giant AstraZeneca to develop quantum applications for drug discovery and development. Earlier, it had also announced a deal with software firm Ansys to bring quantum applications to computer-aided engineering. Most recently, the quantum computing company revealed that it would be purchasing Qubitekk, a firm that designs, builds and integrates the hardware and software for quantum networks. Overall IONQ ranks 6th on our list of the best quantum computing stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of IONQ as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than IONQ but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

A data analyst pouring over a chart, the intricacies of its lines being revealed. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 2 Quantum Computing Inc. (NASDAQ:QUBT) is an integrated photonics company that offers accessible and affordable quantum machines. Even though the firm is small, with a market capitalization of around $880 million, it is one of the best quantum computing stocks according to hedge funds. One of the reasons for this is the significant momentum behind the stock, with shares rallying close to 750% so far this year, as investors bet big on the company to deliver on the promises of quantum technologies and products under development. In late November, the firm announced that it had secured two orders for the thin film lithium niobate (TFLN) photonic chip foundry. TFLN is a cutting edge material used in high-powered computers. This material operates with an extremely high bandwidth and with lower insertion losses, and is likely to be a key enabler of the 1.6 and 3.2 terabit optical switches and interconnects used by hyperscalers in their AI data centers. TFLN is presently only sourced in small quantities from China. However, Quantum Computing plans to open a fully commissioned TFLN fabrication facility in Arizona by the end of the first quarter of 2025. The firm stated in a policy paper published earlier this year that once the facility is functional, it would become the only company in the United States capable of processing 150 mm wafers. TFLN chips can be used for a variety of purposes, including quantum computing, quantum sensing, high-frequency modulators, and LiDAR. Overall QUBT ranks 10th on our list of the best quantum computing stocks to buy according to hedge funds.

Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily COVID-19 drove a surge in newcomers to the area, and real estate companies are rapidly developing new residences, office buildings and hospitality and retail properties. Lake Worth Lagoon, which separates the island of Palm Beach from the city of West Palm Beach on the mainland, once cut a clear demarcation between the haves and have-nots. But their metaphorical distance creeps closer each year with the island’s geographic limitations and West Palm Beach’s transformation into a happening, waterfront destination for millionaires, and perhaps even billionaires, to live, work and play. “It started before COVID[-19], but then COVID[-19] turbocharged everything,” said Jordan Bargas, senior vice president of development for West Palm Beach, Fla.-based Related Ross, regarding the rampant development of luxury residences; office buildings, especially for wealth management firms, and upscale restaurants and retail, often imported from New York and Miami that cater to the nascent “Wall Street South” crowd, among a tidal wave of multigenerational newcomers. Related Articles Architecture Italian Luxury Furniture-maker Natuzzi Forays Into Private Residential With Dubai Residence Real Estate Tanger Posts Solid Q3 Results, Raises 2024 Guidance Again “South Flagler House, our property under construction that’s designed by Robert A.M. Stern Architects with units averaging $15 million, is the perfect example of people who live on the island and are purchasing in West Palm Beach now. Previously, they wouldn’t have been caught dead here,” he added. You May Also Like Workers at the city’s new and slated financial tenants including Goldman Sachs, Elliott, JPMorgan Chase, Millennium, BlackRock and Point72 also desire homes in planned, high-end projects here, from Mr. C Residences to The Ritz-Carlton Residences. Economic research firm TPX projects Vanderbilt University’s pending downtown satellite campus will add another 35,000 local jobs within a quarter century. The school’s staff, along with its nearly 1,000 graduate program students, will need housing too. The shift toward more discerning residents means apartment rentals like Related Ross’ The Laurel are expected to deliver premier amenities on par with condominiums, whether resort-style pools or golf simulators. Onsite brands sweeten the deal. Equinox leased 35,000 square feet above The Laurel’s ground-level retailers Alo and Crate & Barrel. RH, whose rooftop restaurant draws society page names from Palm Beach, jumpstarted CityPlace’s needle-mover migration in 2017. “It was a huge signal of confidence in the market,” said Bargas, of fresh commitments, from Eataly’s second Florida location launching in a former church to home decor e-tailer Perigold’s foray into brick-and-mortar. “Eataly will be a big anchor that brings pedestrian traffic. We’re setting up this place for the next 20 years.” Walkability, activations and art also drive the success of CityPlace and the overall neighborhood. Related Ross commissioned Fred Eversley’s largest public installation Portals for its One Flagler luxury office tower with an Estiatorio Milos restaurant due. Among CityPlace’s 500 annual events, last month’s holiday lights kickoff drew 5,000 people; New Wave Art Wknd organized public art tours and conversation panels in December, and fitness and wellness festival District Fit returns in March. Space doesn’t sit idle for long. While awaiting construction to begin, vacant lots and high-profile corners host makeshift experiences; current pop-ups include Bal Harbour Shops Access, SoulCycle and CityPickle. Related Ross’s total square footage of 6.6 million square feet breaks down into 3.25 million square feet for offices, 1.9 million square feet for residential and 700,000 square feet each for hotels and retail/restaurants. Asked whether fashion remains a viable component (The Laurel was once home to Macy’s), Bargas said, “Clothing is still important, and we’re about to sign a fashion company that appeals to women in their 20s to 40s.” If CityPlace and the Flagler waterfront mirror New York’s SoHo and uptown environs, the Nora District is West Palm Beach’s answer to New York’s downtown scene. An abbreviation of North Railroad Avenue, the trackside enclave where 19th-century developer Henry Flagler’s Florida East Coast Railroad sped up South Florida’s real estate boom, combines historic warehouses and new buildings throughout 40 acres and 2.5 million square feet. The public-private partnership between the city of West Palm Beach and development firms NDT Development, Place Projects and Wheelock Street Capital created a master plan from 2019 to 2022, with initial phases premiering over the next two years. Infrastructure improvements call for new water and sewer lines, storm drainage and widened sidewalks as well as burying power lines. Miami-based ArquitectonicaGEO has been commissioned for streetscapes, landscaping and outdoor seating; a new, old-fashioned cobblestone street creates a sense of place, and green spaces feature pockets parks and a sculpture garden combined with a play area. Joe Furst, founder and managing principal for Place Projects in Miami, said compelling infrastructure, like installing an underground grease trap system, attracted hospitality businesses. “We’re taking that cost away from restaurateurs. All [retail] buildings can be used for food and beverage, which is why those leases did well in advance,” he said, of confirmed tenants such as New York’s Pastis, Juliana’s Pizza, Van Leeuwen Ice Cream and H&H Bagels; Boston’s Loco Taqueria & Oyster Bar; Naples, Fla.’s Del Mar Mediterranean; Madison, N.J.’s Sunday Motor Co., and locally born Celis Juice Bar & Café. In getting ahead of growth, Furst implements lessons learned from developing Miami’s Wynwood District as Goldman Properties’ managing director for a decade. He said their early-stage strategies are nothing alike. “We aren’t just slapping paint on buildings like Wynwood but delivering Class-A retail from the start for sophisticated operators with more than one concept,” said Furst, who also eschewed Wynwood’s signature graffitied façades for different art mediums like artist Carolyn Salas’ aluminum wall sculpture. “Rather than giving away space to get people to come in and having tenant turnover and displacement as rents increase, tenants are signing 10- to -20-year leases here.” Anchored by the 201-room Nora Hotel from New York hoteliers Richard Born, Ira Drukier and Sean MacPherson with nods to Palm Beach architect Addison Mizner, the lifestyle mix features IGK salon, Solidcore Pilates, Sana Skin Studio, The Spot Barbershop, Long Island-based womenswear specialty chain Mint, and ZenHippo’s first flagship for its family programs in Palm Beach County. Apartments, condominiums and office buildings will also add density. Bargas feels West Palm Beach’s retail options, including downtown’s Clematis Street, complement each other and are necessary for the city to evolve to the next level. “Businesses aren’t coming to these different areas because they can get a deal. It’s more about where is my brand best reflected and where will it have the most success.” Sign up for WWD news straight to your inbox every day Get all the top news stories and alerts straight to your inbox.

Title: Why Is APi Group Corp. (APG) Among Halvorsen’s Top Stock Picks Right Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of Norwegian Billionaire Halvorsen's Top 10 Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where APi Group Corp. (NYSE:APG) stands against Halvorsen's other top stock picks. Ole Andreas Halvorsen, the founder and CEO of Viking Global, has built one of the most respected names in the hedge fund world. Born in Norway, Halvorson graduated with an undergraduate degree in economics from Williams College in 1986. He then later earned a postgraduate business degree from Stanford University. Having received his first taste of finance while working for Morgan Stanley, he’s part of an elite group of investors known as the “Tiger Cubs,” former protégés of hedge fund legend Julian Robertson, who went on to launch their own successful firms. Viking Global, based in Greenwich, Connecticut, has grown into an investment powerhouse. Back in 2023, the firm delivered an impressive $6 billion in returns for its investors, ranking just behind heavyweights like Citadel and TCI. Much of this success came from smart bets on big names. In the same year, Halvorsen decided to reopen Viking Global's long/short flagship fund to new investors. Over a decade ago, he had closed the fund, citing its size as a barrier to uncovering profitable trading opportunities. That said, Halvorsen isn't just about bullish bets. While long positions are Viking Global's bread and butter, the firm has also employed strategies that allow it to profit from short positions during turbulent market years like 2020 and 2022. The billionaire firmly believes that effective and profitable trading requires careful analysis and disciplined, long-term valuation. This philosophy has shaped Viking Global's portfolio into a balanced mix of both long-term and short-term investments. While his primary focus remains on long-term stakes in public and private companies, Halvorsen isn’t afraid to embrace "thoughtful risk-taking" to maximize returns. This balanced approach, combining strategic risk with a commitment to disciplined analysis, is at the heart of Viking Global’s success. This year, Viking’s funds have been making a strong comeback. Its hybrid fund, Viking Global Opportunities, which invests in both public stocks and private companies, earned a modest 1% return in the third quarter, trimming its year-to-date losses to 1.6%. Meanwhile, its private-asset fund, Viking Global Opportunities Drawdown, gained 4.2% for the quarter, bringing its total return for the year to 8.3%. After a rough second quarter, these results show Viking is back on track and making waves in the investment world. Overall, as of Q3 2024, Halvorsen’s 13F portfolio reflects a strong focus on the healthcare, finance, services, and technology sectors. The portfolio's total value stands at over $27.43 billion, marking a 1.05% increase compared to the previous quarter. Our Methodology For this analysis, we examined Viking Global's stock portfolio from the third quarter of 2024. The stocks are ranked based on the firm’s stake value in each holding. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A team of engineers surveying a construction site in preparation for a new underground infrastructure. Viking Global's Q3 Stake: $848.9 million Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55 APi Group Corp. (NYSE:APG) is a leading safety services provider specializing in end-to-end integrated occupancy systems, including fire protection, HVAC, and entry systems. Its offerings span design, installation, inspection, and maintenance services, catering to customers across the energy, industrial, and commercial sectors. On November 24, Baird raised its price target for APi Group Corp. (NYSE:APG) stock from $39 to $40, maintaining an Outperform rating. This revision followed analysts’ site visits and assessments of APG’s recent acquisition and its implications for growth. During these visits, Baird analysts engaged with APG field management and customers, marking the first investor-focused visit to Elevated, the company’s newly acquired elevator maintenance division. Baird highlighted that this acquisition significantly broadens APG’s service portfolio and establishes a promising platform for future mergers and acquisitions. APi Group Corp. (NYSE:APG) also reported solid growth during its Q3 2024 earnings call. Revenue increased by 2.4% year-over-year to $1.83 billion, driven by organic growth within the Safety Services segment. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 9.4%, with the company reaffirming its commitment to achieving a 13% adjusted EBITDA margin by 2025. Despite project delays impacting revenues by approximately $150 million, APG remains optimistic about sustained growth and margin improvement. The company also reported an adjusted gross margin rise to 31% and a 9% year-over-year increase in adjusted diluted EPS, reaching $0.51. Overall APG ranks 10th on our list of Halvorsen's top stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of APG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI Stocks Taking Wall Street by Storm. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) stands against the other AI stocks. Wall Street's major indexes closed lower on Monday, December 9th, dragged down by a decline in Nvidia. The plunge pressured the broader technology sector, with investors also turning their attention to an important inflation report due this week. READ NOW: Top 10 AI News Stories For The Weekend and 15 Buzzing AI Stocks Making Headlines Investors expect the consumer price index (CPI) data set to be released on Wednesday, while the producer price index (PPI) is anticipated on Thursday, ahead of the Federal Reserve's meeting on Dec. 17-18. The plunge, however, seems only temporary, and technology stocks are poised to gain in the future. BlackRock anticipates that infrastructure and cybersecurity investments will "shine" in 2025. Jay Jacobs, the firm’s U.S. head of thematic and active ETFs, considers the artificial intelligence boom as a major catalyst. Jacobs said that AI companies need to build out their data centers and that keeping that data safe is also a sound investment play for the New Year. “If you think about your data, you want to spend more on cybersecurity as it gets more valuable. We think this is really going to benefit the cybersecurity [and the] software community which is seeing very rapid revenue growth based off of this AI.” Jacobs further stated that even though technology may seem tangible, it is also heavily reliant on physical infrastructure such as energy, materials like copper, and even real estate. These real-world components are essential for supporting the systems that are used every day. He further went on to say that it’s not just the mega-cap tech names that are winning, other semiconductor companies and other data center companies are benefiting from the rise of this theme. In this regard, AI ETFs can play a significant role in helping investors gain targeted exposure while mitigating some of the risks associated with investing in individual AI stocks. They are a smart way for investors to invest in a theme for seeking longer-term gains. “Identifying future winners can be very difficult – it’s not always the obvious names that make it in the long-term”.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 115 Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) is an online retailer that leverages AI in its e-commerce business.

Alibaba Cloud’s robust "Cloud + AI" development strategy has enabled it to achieve substantial growth in external client revenue. The growth includes double-digit increases in public cloud services and notable triple-digit growth in AI-related product revenue for the fifth consecutive quarter, as per the latest September quarter earnings. Collaborations with companies such as Japan's Lightblue, Malaysia's Pictureworks, Singapore's Atlas, and China’s Drunk Elephant demonstrate the diverse applications of Alibaba Cloud’s technologies. "We are thrilled to witness our robust cloud infrastructure and AI offerings empowering organizations across a diverse range of industries to further drive transformation in 2024 with our partners together. As the leading cloud service provider in Asia, we remain committed to helping our customers enhance their operations and deepen their connections with consumers, while collaborating with our ecosystem partners to unlock the full potential of AI and cloud technologies for businesses of all sizes”.

Meanwhile, analysts expected the company to earn an adjusted $1.48 per share on $14.12B in revenue.

"Record level AI demand drove Oracle Cloud Infrastructure revenue up 52% in Q2, a much higher growth rate than any of our hyperscale cloud infrastructure competitors. Growth in the AI segment of our Infrastructure business was extraordinary—GPU consumption was up 336% in the quarter—and we delivered the world's largest and fastest AI SuperComputer scaling up to 65,000 NVIDIA H200 GPUs. With our remaining performance obligation up 50% to $97 billion, we believe our already impressive growth rates will continue to climb even higher. This fiscal year, total Oracle Cloud revenue should top $25 billion." Overall ORCL ranks 4th on our list of the AI stocks that are taking Wall Street by storm.

Title: How is it we know more about Luigi Mangione than we do about Thomas Crooks?
URL: https://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2024/12/how_is_it_we_know_more_about_luigi_mangione_than_we_do_about_thomas_crooks.html
Time Published: 2024-12-11T05:00:00Z
Full Content:
Within hours of his apprehension in Pennsylvania in connection with the cold-blooded murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, scads of information rolled out about the life and times of suspect Luigi Mangione, the 26-year-old man who has been accused of the killing, and in a very short period of time, the Internet being a fast medium. We've seen pictures of his family, and heard their statements of shock and regret at the news. We learned he grew up wealthy, the son of the owner of two resorts near Baltimore. We learned he once worked in a nursing home owned by his family. We learned where he went to school, even high school where he was a valedictorian, and that he was quite accomplished in the difficult subjects of computer science and engineering at an Ivy League university. We've heard from his friends, who say he was normal and outgoing, with some even seeing leadership qualities in him. We learned he was athletic and outdoorsy, enjoying hiking and surfing. We learned he was well traveled, living as a digital nomad in Hawaii, traveling to Japan, living in San Francisco, as well as Pennsylvania and Maryland in his life earlier. We learned about his online presence through his many social media accounts, posting pictures of his ripped physique, liking the Unabomber, disliking Jordan Peterson, getting into deep philosophical discussions with others. We learned about his surfing accident which led to back surgery, leaving him with four pins in his back, apparent pictures of which he posted on his social media bannerheads. We even learned that, according to a friend, that the surgery made it too painful for him to have sexual relations ever again, which he resented. We learned of his obsessive dislike for the health insurance industry -- and can only recall that involuntary eunuchs have been known to take revenge on their tormentors. We learned about his manifesto which was picked up by the cops when they apprehended him, and it seems to have been leaked already into the Internet, railing against the health care industry. So there's quite a lot of information out there, and this synopsis is far from complete. That, in addition to the details of the murder and the details of the apprehension, presents a pretty comprehensive picture. It's in striking contrast to the last high-profile killer who came to our attention last July, Thomas Crooks, another young man with a similar background who got his name in the news for attempting to kill President Trump amid a sea of Secret Service incompetence, but did manage to murder an innocent firefighter who was nearby, and injure two others in addition to President Trump, before he was shot dead by a cop. His age was similar, his engineering background was similar, his working in a nursing home was similar But we hear nothing of the level of information Mangione got from this miserable freak -- little about his political motivations, which political party he identified with, what his political views were, who his friends were, nothing about his very strange family who threw away their silverware to prevent police from finding it in a home search after the killing and attempted assassination, nothing about the strange associated classmates who could have been involved in the attack. We know nothing about the strange ad he made for Blackrock, or the 18 burner phones in his backpack. We don't know who he was talking to on the phone, seen in a video, before he launched into his assassination bid. If he had a manifesto, we haven't seen it. And his social media accounts were quickly scrubbed and shut down. Now, some of this can be explained away by Mangione having an internet presence and being a non-misfit socially, which made more information available generally. But that doesn't explain all of it. Where are the classmates who knew him? Why is his family so silent? Why has his social media presence been suppressed? And why is the Secret Service seemingly going out of its way to obstruct Congress? There have been quite a few shouting matches at this point. Even less information is available about a second apparent wannabe-assassin of Trump in Florida a few weeks later, accused gunman Ryan Routh.We know he was a loser of some kind, having no money and living in a shambling house in Hawaii (as Mangione did). We don't know how he got a lot of money to travel around trailing Trump from North Carolina to Florida. There is some information about his inchoate political views, which like everything else about him, is fragmented. The guess one can make for this assymetrical distribution of information is that the press and the government investigating the assassination attempts hates Trump, and may even be implicated in the assasination attempts, as if in a coverup. By contrast, most people are pretty appalled about the cold-blooded murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York. That may explain why so little information about the attempts on Trump are out there in contrast to Mangione. They'd rather sweep it under the rug. It's hard to say with certainly what this is about, but it's just strange that some information gets out more readily about major events than others. Funny how it's the information we want most.

It's in striking contrast to the last high-profile killer who came to our attention last July, Thomas Crooks, another young man with a similar background who got his name in the news for attempting to kill President Trump amid a sea of Secret Service incompetence, but did manage to murder an innocent firefighter who was nearby, and injure two others in addition to President Trump, before he was shot dead by a cop. His age was similar, his engineering background was similar, his working in a nursing home was similar But we hear nothing of the level of information Mangione got from this miserable freak -- little about his political motivations, which political party he identified with, what his political views were, who his friends were, nothing about his very strange family who threw away their silverware to prevent police from finding it in a home search after the killing and attempted assassination, nothing about the strange associated classmates who could have been involved in the attack. We know nothing about the strange ad he made for Blackrock, or the 18 burner phones in his backpack. We don't know who he was talking to on the phone, seen in a video, before he launched into his assassination bid. If he had a manifesto, we haven't seen it. And his social media accounts were quickly scrubbed and shut down. Now, some of this can be explained away by Mangione having an internet presence and being a non-misfit socially, which made more information available generally. But that doesn't explain all of it. Where are the classmates who knew him? Why is his family so silent? Why has his social media presence been suppressed? And why is the Secret Service seemingly going out of its way to obstruct Congress? There have been quite a few shouting matches at this point. Even less information is available about a second apparent wannabe-assassin of Trump in Florida a few weeks later, accused gunman Ryan Routh.We know he was a loser of some kind, having no money and living in a shambling house in Hawaii (as Mangione did). We don't know how he got a lot of money to travel around trailing Trump from North Carolina to Florida. There is some information about his inchoate political views, which like everything else about him, is fragmented. The guess one can make for this assymetrical distribution of information is that the press and the government investigating the assassination attempts hates Trump, and may even be implicated in the assasination attempts, as if in a coverup. By contrast, most people are pretty appalled about the cold-blooded murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York. That may explain why so little information about the attempts on Trump are out there in contrast to Mangione. They'd rather sweep it under the rug. It's hard to say with certainly what this is about, but it's just strange that some information gets out more readily about major events than others. Funny how it's the information we want most.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best American Dividend Stocks To Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) stands against the other American dividend stocks. The US economy expanded by 2.8% in the third quarter of 2024, as reported in the Advance GDP release from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. This marked the ninth straight quarter of growth in real GDP. While the third-quarter increase was robust, it slightly lagged behind the 3% growth recorded in the second quarter of 2024. Economists polled by Dow Jones had anticipated a 3.1% rise. Regardless of market conditions, investors frequently seek to minimize risk in their portfolios, and investing in dividend stocks is a reliable approach to achieve this. A report by S&P Dow Jones Indices highlighted the growing significance of dividends as a source of personal income. Over time, dividend income has steadily risen, increasing from 2.68% in the fourth quarter of 1980 to 7.88% in the second quarter of 2024. In contrast, interest income has seen a decline, dropping from 14.58% to 7.61% during the same period. Also read: 8 Best Dividend Kings To Invest In For Safe Dividend Growth The Dividend Aristocrat Index, which tracks the performance of companies with 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, has surged by over 10% since the start of 2024, underperforming the market. Although dividend stocks may not have been hitting it out of the park this year, US companies have remained dedicated to rewarding shareholders by consistently paying dividends. According to a report by S&P Dow Jones, for the 12-month period ending in September 2024, US common dividend increases totaled $74.7 billion, marking a 16.9% rise from the $63.9 billion recorded in the same period a year earlier, ending in September 2023. The report also mentioned that in the third quarter of 2024, there were 480 dividend increases reported, marking a 7.1% rise compared to the 448 increases in the same period in 2023. The total value of these dividend hikes amounted to $14.1 billion for the quarter. WisdomTree offers an interesting perspective on global dividends in its report. According to their findings, the global equity market currently distributes around $1.6 trillion in dividends, an increase from approximately $1.5 trillion last year. Notably, 55% of these dividends come from outside the US, which is about 15% more than the non-US share in market cap-weighted indexes. On the other hand, US companies account for 44% of global dividends, which is considerably less than their 63% share of global market capitalization. This suggests that non-US markets are more heavily weighted in dividend-focused indexes, while US exposure is relatively lower. For instance, European countries make up about a quarter of global dividend payments, which is 10% more than their share of the global market cap. That said, the start of dividend payments by several major US tech companies contributed an additional 1.1 percentage points to the global growth rate in Q2, as reported by Janus Henderson’s Global Dividend Index report. The report also mentioned that the contribution from these new dividend payers will persist throughout the remainder of the year, ensuring that US payout growth remains ahead of the global average. In view of this, let’s take a look at some of the best American dividend stocks. Our Methodology: We created this list by scanning Insider Monkey's Q3 2024 database for US companies that have consistently increased their dividends for at least 10 years and are traded on American stock exchanges. Then, we chose stocks with dividend yields above 2% as of December 10. Finally, we selected the top 8 companies with the most hedge fund investors in Q3 2024 from the refined dataset. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A home improvement store overflowing with a variety of products and supplies. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 82 The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) is an American multinational home improvement retail company that sells appliances, tools, construction equipment, and related products. The company faced challenges this year due to increasing macroeconomic uncertainty, which dampened overall consumer demand and led to reduced spending on home improvement projects. In its latest quarter, it reported a 1.3% decline in same-store sales compared to the previous year—an unfavorable outcome for any retail-focused business. Management anticipates this downward trend will persist for the remainder of the fiscal year. That said, the stock has surged by over 22.4% since the start of 2024. This was also highlighted by Carillon Tower Advisers in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say: “While Home Depot, Inc.’s (NYSE:HD) recent reported earnings were somewhat tepid, the market seems to be pricing in an inversion of the company’s sales, driven by lower interest rates. Home Depot reported its seventh consecutive quarter of same-store sales declines, giving back substantial gains that it enjoyed during the pandemic. High mortgage rates have also put a damper on existing home sales. People typically spend the most on home repairs and improvements in years when they buy or sell houses, often conducting both transactions in the same year.” In the third quarter of 2024, The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) reported revenue of $40.22 billion, which showed a 6.6% growth from the same period last year. The company's operating income came in at $5.4 billion and its operating margin was 13.5%. It experienced improved customer interest in seasonal products and various outdoor projects, along with additional sales driven by demand related to hurricane activity. In the first nine months of the year, The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) generated over $15 billion in operating cash flow. The company's strong cash position makes it a generous dividend payer. The company currently pays a quarterly dividend of $2.25 per share and has a dividend yield of 2.13%, as of December 10. It is one of the best dividend stocks on our list as the company has raised its payouts for 14 consecutive years. According to Insider Monkey's database of Q3 2024, 82 hedge funds owned stakes in The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD), down from 86 in the preceding quarter. These stakes are worth nearly $7.6 billion in total. Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management owned the largest stake in the company. Overall HD ranks 3rd on our list of the best American dividend stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential for HD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than HD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

(NYSE:PFE) is an American multinational pharmaceutical and biotech company.

Since the start of 2024, the stock has fallen by over 13%. That said, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) reported strong earnings in the most recent quarter.

We purchased Pfizer to capture the potential upside from any turnaround following the COVID-induced boom-bust cycle of the last few years. Pfizer’s stock price sank by more than 40% in 2023 as COVID-19 vaccine revenues rolled off, providing an attractive entry point for us.

Title: Why Is Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) Among the Best Cosmetic Surgery and Aesthetics Stocks to Invest In Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 11 Best Cosmetic Surgery and Aesthetics Stocks to Invest in Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stands against the other cosmetic surgery and aesthetics stocks. In the face of economic uncertainty, consumer preferences in the beauty industry are changing. A Bloomberg Intelligence poll conducted in June 2024 with 650 participants found that 40% of respondents gave beauty and personal care purchases more importance than other products. Nonetheless, this represents the lowest result since the survey's launch two years ago, a 10-percentage-point drop from January. Despite the continued success of premium cosmetic products, there is less demand for mainstream, reasonably priced products, which make up the majority of the market. Leonard Lauder's "Lipstick Index" theory, which associates economic slowdowns with increased spending on self-care, seems less sound these days. Although the beauty industry has grown significantly over the last five years, Andrea Felsted, a Bloomberg Opinion columnist, observes that customer interests are beginning to shift. This drop in affordable beauty purchases raises questions about how well the industry can withstand economic downturns. The results point to changing customer behavior, with high-end products performing better and less expensive markets being squeezed during difficult economic conditions. Amidst this shift, according to Ulta CEO Dave Kimbell, younger generations, Gen Z and Gen Alpha, are more willing to spend money on beauty than previous generations, especially on skincare or as a way to express themselves. He also mentioned that a growing percentage of Americans are Hispanic consumers, who are more likely to be active in the area. Here are some comments from Kimbell: “While we anticipate that some of these headwinds will persist in the near term, we are confident in our ability to deliver on our plans and set ourselves up for long-term growth.” Meanwhile, the market for medical aesthetics, or procedures meant to enhance patients' physical attractiveness, is expected to grow in the future. According to research by senior partner Olivier Leclerc and colleagues, the CAGR for neuromodulators like Botox is anticipated to reach 11.9 percent in the US and Canada by 2025. By 2025, the compound annual growth rate for injectable dermal fillers, such as biostimulators and hyaluronic acid fillers, may reach 3.8 percent. Moreover, as per McKinsey's research report, through 2025, the medical aesthetics industry is expected to continue growing at a rate close to double digits. In one of the recent developments, finance solutions like "buy-now, pay-later" loans are being given to make cosmetic procedures more affordable because of the rising demand for these procedures in the United States, as reported by Bloomberg. While the demand spike from the pandemic has subsided, rates of aesthetic procedures are still substantially higher than they were before COVID, with a 2023 increase over 2024, according to a June 2024 study from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. Financing programs that divide expenses ranging from $200 to $10,000 into smaller installments over three to sixty months are now advantageous for facial procedures and other treatments. These choices are especially appealing to younger consumers because they frequently include interest-free terms and low credit requirements. According to Bloomberg, sales of asset-backed securities in the United States have increased by almost 20% year over year, reflecting this trend in the larger financial market. This highlights the connection between high customer demand and innovative financial solutions. In this article, we first used a stock screener, to list down all Cosmetic Surgery and Aesthetics Stocks (as of the writing of this article) with the highest institutional ownership. From the resultant dataset, we chose 11 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors, using Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds in Q3 2024 to gauge hedge fund sentiment for stocks. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here) A smiling baby with an array of baby care products in the foreground. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 81 The multinational healthcare firm Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), through its subsidiary MENTOR, specializes in breast reconstruction and aesthetics. For use in cosmetic and reconstructive breast surgery treatments, the company offers breast implants, tissue expanders, and other surgical materials. Mentor's Breast Implant Simulator app allows users to submit images or use real-time video to model implant sizes. It uses augmented reality to display breast augmentation outcomes. It also provides educational content, connects users to nearby surgeons, and makes it easier to share discoveries for feedback. Revenue increased by 5.25% YoY to $22.47 billion in the third quarter of 2024, with Innovative Medicine leading the way with a 4.9% YoY growth to $14.58 billion. Moreover, the MedTech division, which encompasses aesthetics, reported a 6.4% increase in operational sales in the third quarter of 2024. Acquisitions such as Abiomed had a favorable effect on this division. The firm produced $14 billion in free cash flow in the first nine months of this year, compared to $11.9 billion in the same period last year. For the past 62 years, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has consistently increased its dividends. The current quarterly dividend paid by the firm is $1.62 per share. An analyst at Wolfe Research named Alexandria Hammond began covering Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) with a $190 price target and an Outperform rating. Beyond Mounjaro/Zepbound from Lilly (LLY), the firm anticipates growth names and/or "dream the dream" names to win in 2025. J&J's Pharma growth drivers, including JNJ-2113, Tremfya, nipocalimab, Carvykti, and Drazalex Faspro, are viewed as "best-in-class" by the firm. Moreover, Wolfe predicts that J&J's revenue would increase by at least 3% despite Stelara's loss of exclusivity challenges. Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management was the largest stakeholder in the company from among the funds in Insider Monkey's database. It owns 7,560,199 shares worth $1.23 billion as of Q3. Overall JNJ ranks 1st on our list of the best cosmetic surgery and aesthetics stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential for JNJ as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 11 Best Cosmetic Surgery and Aesthetics Stocks to Invest in Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) stands against the other cosmetic surgery and aesthetics stocks. In the face of economic uncertainty, consumer preferences in the beauty industry are changing. A Bloomberg Intelligence poll conducted in June 2024 with 650 participants found that 40% of respondents gave beauty and personal care purchases more importance than other products. Nonetheless, this represents the lowest result since the survey's launch two years ago, a 10-percentage-point drop from January. Despite the continued success of premium cosmetic products, there is less demand for mainstream, reasonably priced products, which make up the majority of the market. Leonard Lauder's "Lipstick Index" theory, which associates economic slowdowns with increased spending on self-care, seems less sound these days. Although the beauty industry has grown significantly over the last five years, Andrea Felsted, a Bloomberg Opinion columnist, observes that customer interests are beginning to shift. This drop in affordable beauty purchases raises questions about how well the industry can withstand economic downturns. The results point to changing customer behavior, with high-end products performing better and less expensive markets being squeezed during difficult economic conditions. Amidst this shift, according to Ulta CEO Dave Kimbell, younger generations, Gen Z and Gen Alpha, are more willing to spend money on beauty than previous generations, especially on skincare or as a way to express themselves. He also mentioned that a growing percentage of Americans are Hispanic consumers, who are more likely to be active in the area. Here are some comments from Kimbell: “While we anticipate that some of these headwinds will persist in the near term, we are confident in our ability to deliver on our plans and set ourselves up for long-term growth.” Meanwhile, the market for medical aesthetics, or procedures meant to enhance patients' physical attractiveness, is expected to grow in the future. According to research by senior partner Olivier Leclerc and colleagues, the CAGR for neuromodulators like Botox is anticipated to reach 11.9 percent in the US and Canada by 2025. By 2025, the compound annual growth rate for injectable dermal fillers, such as biostimulators and hyaluronic acid fillers, may reach 3.8 percent. Moreover, as per McKinsey's research report, through 2025, the medical aesthetics industry is expected to continue growing at a rate close to double digits. In one of the recent developments, finance solutions like "buy-now, pay-later" loans are being given to make cosmetic procedures more affordable because of the rising demand for these procedures in the United States, as reported by Bloomberg. While the demand spike from the pandemic has subsided, rates of aesthetic procedures are still substantially higher than they were before COVID, with a 2023 increase over 2024, according to a June 2024 study from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. Financing programs that divide expenses ranging from $200 to $10,000 into smaller installments over three to sixty months are now advantageous for facial procedures and other treatments. These choices are especially appealing to younger consumers because they frequently include interest-free terms and low credit requirements. According to Bloomberg, sales of asset-backed securities in the United States have increased by almost 20% year over year, reflecting this trend in the larger financial market. This highlights the connection between high customer demand and innovative financial solutions. In this article, we first used a stock screener, to list down all Cosmetic Surgery and Aesthetics Stocks (as of the writing of this article) with the highest institutional ownership. From the resultant dataset, we chose 11 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors, using Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds in Q3 2024 to gauge hedge fund sentiment for stocks. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here) A pharmacist handing out a pharmaceutical drug to a patient in a drug store or chemist. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 68 The biopharmaceutical business AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) focuses on developing and marketing innovative therapies, such as cosmetic and dermatological products. The company, being one of the Best Aesthetics Stocks, offers aesthetic procedures like BOTOX Cosmetic and JUVÉDERM dermal fillers to treat wrinkles and facial volume loss. Revenue increased 4% year over year in Q3 2024, showing robust growth in the Skyrizi, Rinvoq, and Neuroscience portfolios. The aesthetics portfolio generated $1.239 billion in net revenues worldwide. While global Juvederm net revenues decreased 19.7% year over year to $258 million, global Botox Cosmetic net revenues increased by 8.2% to $671 million. Significant market expansions were made by Allergan Aesthetics when it received FDA approval for its platysma band-targeting Botox Cosmetic and introduced its masseter muscle prominence (MMP) treatment in China. At the ASDS conference, AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) also presented its modern research and patient-centered tactics. The firm increased its adjusted EPS outlook for 2024 to $10.90-$10.94, excluding IPR&D and milestone expenses incurred after Q3 and the upcoming Aliada Therapeutics acquisition. In October of this year, AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) increased its quarterly dividend by about 6% to $1.64 per share. The firm extended its dividend growth streak to 52 years with this increase. Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group was the largest stakeholder in the company from among the funds in Insider Monkey's database. It owns over 2.4 million shares worth $487.28 million as of Q3. Overall ABBV ranks 2nd on our list of the best cosmetic surgery and aesthetics stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential for ABBV as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ABBV but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Bitcoin LTHs cash out at 326% gains: Can new demand keep BTC stable?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/bitcoin-lths-cash-out-at-326-gains-can-new-demand-keep-btc-stable/
Time Published: 2024-12-11T04:00:34Z

Long-term Bitcoin holders are cashing out amid a rally, while new investors help absorb supply. As Bitcoin’s [BTC] price continues its impressive rally, long-term holders are seizing the opportunity to cash out, realizing gains of approximately 326% on their investments with an average entry price of $23.4K. This surge in profit-taking has added selling pressure to the market, yet BTC has demonstrated remarkable resilience, absorbing the increased supply. But what’s driving these LTHs to sell now? And how are new investors stepping in to sustain the market’s upward momentum? Long-term BTC holders are capitalizing on the current rally, realizing an average 326% profit with an entry cost of $23.4K. This behavior aligns with historical patterns where significant price surges often trigger profit-taking. However, this wave of selling appears more strategic than reactive. With BTC trading well above the LTH cost basis, many are opting to de-risk amidst macroeconomic uncertainties, including potential interest rate shifts and market liquidity concerns. Source: X Additionally, the cyclical nature of Bitcoin’s halving events may play a role, with some LTHs anticipating a plateau or temporary downturn. Despite this selling pressure, Bitcoin’s resilience – buoyed by strong demand from newer market entrants – shows a robust redistribution phase rather than an alarming sell-off. This shift in market dynamics could redefine BTC’s near-term trajectory. The recent surge in BTC’s price reflects a shift where demand, rather than just supply constraints, is driving its growth. New investors, particularly those leveraging institutional-grade financial instruments like Bitcoin ETFs, have played a pivotal role in absorbing the available supply. For instance, the iShares Bitcoin Trust by BlackRock amassed $10 billion in assets under management within seven weeks, accounting for over 40% of spot ETF volumes. This rapid adoption has spurred projections that Bitcoin ETFs might surpass gold ETFs in total assets in the near future. With ETFs now channeling 75% of new Bitcoin investments, their influence could grow even further, especially as the halving event heightened scarcity. Anticipation of reduced supply coupled with increasing demand positions new investors as key drivers of Bitcoin’s price momentum​. As Bitcoin navigates heightened selling pressure from long-term holders, the road ahead appears shaped by crucial developments. The halving event has tightened BTC supply, boosting scarcity premiums. Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024–2025 Institutional interest, especially through spot Bitcoin ETFs, may stabilize demand and promote adoption. However, regulatory clarity remains crucial for BTC’s mainstream recognition. Bitcoin’s growing link to macroeconomic trends and traditional assets positions it as both speculative and maturing. Its ability to sustain growth or navigate volatility depends on balancing innovation, adoption, and the ongoing tension between scarcity and liquidity.

Vishal Mega Mart is a one-stop destination catering to middle and lower-middle-income consumers in India. The product range includes both in-house and third-party brands, covering three key categories -- apparel, general merchandise, and fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG). Report by KS Badri Narayanan of businessline | Read here Leader with strong moats in a growing industry - Emkay Global Research Vishal Mega Mart (VMML) caters to a large and fast-growing TAM (USD430bn; ~10% CAGR), by affordably addressing aspirations of the middle-/lower-income India. Variety and Affordability are key moats, as VMML is a one-stop-shop for Apparel/FMCG/General Merchandise categories, and offers the best affordability with high share of own brands (~72%). VMML aspires to continue delivering strong double-digit growth, mainly helped by low-teen SSG trends and partly via store additions. VMML expects to see retail space CAGR of ~10%, as it currently caters to ~400 cities vs a huge potential of ~1,300 cities (with population above 50K). VMML also has potential to go deeper in existing cities. High store-throughput and lower WC needs ensure best-in-class payback (18-20 months) and generate sufficient cash-flows for pursuing growth. IPO of Rs80bn is entirely OFS, with post-IPO market cap of Rs352bn. Key risks: Supply overhang on big PE ownership and potential ESOP dilution (4-5%). Vishal Mega Mart is all set to launch its ₹8,000 crore IPO today for public at a price band of ₹74-78. The IPO will close on December 13 and the market lot is 190 shares. The proposed IPO is entirely an Offer For Sale (OFS) of shares by promoter Samayat Services LLP, with no fresh issue of equity shares.
