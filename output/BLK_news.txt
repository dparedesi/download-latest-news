Investors shouldn't complain, though, after an action-packed start to the week led the coin to hit a new high. The price of the biggest coin by market cap broke a new record of $108,786 Monday ahead of Donald Trump's inauguration. It has since dropped by nearly 4%, CoinGecko shows. And despite President Trump not explicitly declaring plans for a Bitcoin strategic reserve in his first crypto executive order, the coin is still sitting comfortably above the $100,000 mark. Bitcoin soared above $100,000 following Trump's November election; the President promised to slash regulation and help the digital asset industry. And he is keeping his crypto promises—albeit while annoying some hardcore Bitcoiners in the process. Money continued to flow into the crypto investment vehicles this week, after investors threw billions at the funds last week ahead of the inauguration. But it didn't stop, with $802.6 million hitting the funds on Tuesday alone, data from Farside Investors shows. By the end of the week, over $1.75 billion worth of assets had entered the Bitcoin ETFs. The bullishness comes as Donald Trump is expected to be a net positive for the industry. The Republican campaigned on a promise to help the industry and now buying Bitcoin has never been easier thanks to the funds. The spot bitcoin ETFs quietly on fire to start year, with $4.2b in flows which is 6% of all ETF flows. Now at +$40b net since launch with aum at $121b and return of 127%. For context they just passed ESG ETFs in assets ($117b) and have about same as gold spot. pic.twitter.com/GADOomLXD4 — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) January 24, 2025 Bitcoiners had been waiting for it for years. And on Tuesday, President Donald Trump kept his campaign promise to pardon Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht. The Bitcoin enthusiast and founder of the dark web e-commerce site—mainly used for buying drugs using Bitcoin—was released shortly after and expressed enormous gratitude to President Trump. The crypto community flooded his digital wallets with BTC donations, too. But Ulbricht—who went to prison in 2013—might already just be sitting on a goldmine: Untouched Bitcoin wallets linked to Ross Ulbricht and Silk Road now hold over $47 million worth of the asset. Ulbricht has long been considered a hero in the Bitcoin community for creating one of the first marketplaces to accept the cryptocurrency. And though it still can't be verified that the wallets do indeed belong to him, it's not beyond the realm of possibility. Ahead of Donald Trump's shock November 5 win, the President had promised plans for a Bitcoin strategic reserve. But after signing his first crypto executive order on Thursday, which touched on the possibility of a crypto stockpile, Bitcoiners noticed one thing—there was no mention of their beloved orange coin, just "digital assets." "The Working Group shall evaluate the potential creation and maintenance of a national digital asset stockpile and propose criteria for establishing such a stockpile, potentially derived from cryptocurrencies lawfully seized by the Federal Government through its law enforcement efforts," the order read. The news has angered ardent Bitcoiners, who have been hurling the usual insults about "shitcoinery," and who think it may lead the government to building up a stash of other digital coins. Emergency Press Conference: Ripple is undermining American prosperity, freedom, and Bitcoin. Ripple is actively lobbying to stop a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve in the U.S. while pushing their centralized, corporate-controlled token. We will not stand for it. pic.twitter.com/EHldJHxyR9 — Jack Mallers (@jackmallers) January 24, 2025 Software company MicroStrategy shareholders are seemingly all-in on the firm's Bitcoin strategy: They on Tuesday voted for a 30x increase to the number of authorized Class A common shares so that the company could have more resources to buy the cryptocurrency. The news came as the company announced its latest Bitcoin buy, bringing its holdings to 461,000 Bitcoin—worth over $48 billion. And on Friday, the firm said that it would redeem over $1 billion worth of its existing debt accumulated early while building up the stash. Elsewhere, British multinational bank Standard Chartered, which has come out with very bullish predictions in the past, said in a Wednesday note that Bitcoin would continue to soar as pension funds enter the space. Analysts at the bank forecasted that institutions enthusiasm for the asset could mean the coin hits $200,000 by the end of 2025. But there were even bigger price predictions for Bitcoin from major players this week. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said that growing adoption could push the price of the asset to $700,000, while Coinbase founder and CEO Brian Armstrong projected a price in the "multiple millions" at some undetermined point in the future.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below. Building a great investment portfolio and, therefore, wealth takes a lot of patience and time. Portfolios can also take many shapes depending on the investor’s goals and purpose. For some, it’s all about chasing high-risk, high-reward opportunities, which promise quicker returns, while for other investors, it’s about a steadier approach focusing on dividend payments and long-term growth. Both strategies have benefits and again, the right one depends on the investor’s goals, risk appetite and time horizon. Don't Miss: Unlock the hidden potential of commercial real estate — This platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today! Arrived Home's Private Credit Fund’s has historically paid an annualized dividend yield of 8.1%*, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with just a $100 minimum. One investor recently shared his journey and explained how he turned $3.50 per hour investments into a $4.4 million portfolio in over 35 years. While his approach relied heavily on dividends and closed-end funds, a major key to his success involved making bold moves on risky stocks like IMMU (Immunomedics) and SAVA (Cassava Sciences). He held IMMU stocks for decades and sold them at the right time, generating $2.2 million for his portfolio, which shows how long-term strategies and perhaps a bit of luck can pay off big. “Started at $3.50 per hour. Went back to school in my early 30s, as did my wife. Definitely no inheritance and student loans to boot. Just 35 years of investing. [...] Got lucky with IMMU buyout after riding that one (in and out) for ~30 years,” the investor said. Trending: ‘Scrolling To UBI' — Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.26/share with a $1000 minimum. Now, he’s planning on shifting gears to more conservative, balanced, high-yield stocks that pay dividends. With his holdings allocated to 150 different stocks, his top 10 favorites make up 25% of his $300K annual dividends. These picks include a combination of dividend-growth stocks, closed-end funds and high-risk plays and he’s shared them in a thread in Reddit’s r/dividends community. Let’s closely examine his top 10 stock picks and why they appeal to so many investors. Investor With $300K in Dividends and a $4.4 Million Portfolio Shares His Top 10 Stocks BSTZ (BlackRock Science and Technology Trust II) BSTZ is a closed-end fund focusing on tech innovation, such as AI, robotics and biotech. With a current dividend yield of 10.04%, this pick is a favorite among investors who want high yields and seek growth and exposure to advanced industries. JRI (Nuveen Real Asset Income and Growth Fund) JRI invests in assets like real estate and infrastructure, offering buyers diversification and a hedge against inflation. With a dividend yield of around 7.89%, JRI charms many investors, especially those close to or already retired and those looking for stability. Trending: It’s no wonder Jeff Bezos holds over $70 million in art — this alternative asset has outpaced the S&P 500 since 1995, delivering an average annual return of 11.4%. Here’s how everyday investors are getting started. DSL (DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund) DSL specializes in global fixed-income securities, such as high-yield bonds and new market debt. Its current dividend yield is 10.17%. Investors buy DSL because of its high dividend rate and diversification across assets. NRO (Neuberger Berman Real Estate Securities Income Fund) Boasting a 10.75% dividend yield, NRO offers access to real estate securities, primarily REITs, which generate returns through property income. KYN (Kayne Anderson Energy Infrastructure Fund) KYN invests in energy infrastructure acquisitions, including pipelines and storage facilities. With a 9.97% dividend yield, this fund appeals to investors seeking income and exposure to a traditionally high-yielding industry. HIO (Western Asset High Income Opportunity Fund) As a high-yield bond fund created for income generation, HIO offers a dividend gain of 9.50% and appeals to investors due to its substantial profits in fixed-income securities. See Also: Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today! IDE (Voya Infrastructure, Industrials and Materials Fund) With a dividend yield of 8.94%, IDE specializes in infrastructure and industrial sectors, providing investors with insight into essential services, such as materials and transportation. MO (Altria Group) MO is a leader in the tobacco sector and offers a 9.91% dividend yield. The group has a strong cash flow, is a reliable dividend stock as per investors and is a good choice for many because it offers diversification into alternative products. ARCC (Ares Capital Corporation) ARCC is a business development company that offers financing to mid-sized companies and offers a dividend yield of 9.91%. Investors who want to benefit from the expansion of private companies find ARCC a good buy. HYT (BlackRock Corporate High Yield Fund) With dividend returns of 9.43% currently, HYT invests in a portfolio of corporate high-yield bonds. The fund’s focus on offering regular income and a buffer against market volatility makes it a favorite for many investors. The changing interest rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider. For instance, the Ascent Income Fund from EquityMultiple targets stable income from senior commercial real estate debt positions and has a historical distribution yield of 12.1% backed by real assets.

U.Today - Large investors have been driving Bitcoin price gains since the U.S. election, with their holdings increasing from 16.2 million to 16.4 million BTC, according to data from CryptoQuant. In contrast, small investors reduced their holdings from 1.75 million to 1.69 million BTC during the same period. Bitcoin ETFs are now the largest holders of the flagship cryptocurrency. The 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs in existence have collectively passed $100 billion in assets under management, one of the most successful ETF launches in history. The funds now own slightly more than 1.1 million Bitcoin, equivalent to about 5% of all the Bitcoin in existence. Collectively, Bitcoin ETFs now own more of the cryptocurrency than legendary pseudonymous founder Satoshi Nakamoto, who is believed to control as much as 1.1 million Bitcoin. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has amassed a remarkable $60 billion in Bitcoin (BTC), holding 574,118.84380 BTC on its balance sheet. Recent data from Farside Investors reveals that Bitcoin ETFs have seen total inflows of $188.7 million, with BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) accounting for $154.6 million of that — making up 81% of the net inflows. The legendary finance analyst Tom Lee thinks Bitcoin price can go as high as $250,000 in 2025. The potential for the U.S. to legitimize Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset dramatically enhances its long-term price outlook, said Lee. Anthony Scaramucci highlighted the best-case scenario for the BTC price in the next 12 months. “Over the next 12 months, I believe something in the range of $250,000 is possible — perhaps even highly probable, based on the current price cycle,” he said. Another seasoned trader Peter Brandt maintains his less optimistic 2025 BTC price target of $135,000. Nonetheless, with the current Bitcoin market cap of $2 trillion, it's likely that the BTC rally will continue in 2025. This article was originally published on U.Today

The bitcoin price has rocketed past $100,000 per bitcoin, hitting a fresh all-time high ahead of Trump's inauguration as the chief executive of the world's largest asset manager BlackRock reveals sovereign wealth funds are exploring bitcoin. Now, as the Federal Reserve grapples with a fresh dollar crisis, the chief executive of major bitcoin and crypto exchange Coinbase has predicted when the bitcoin price could flip gold's $18 trillion. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run Coinbase chief executive Brian Armstrong has issued a huge bitcoin price prediction, forecasting ... [+] bitcoin could flip gold by 2030. "Any country with gold reserves should be holding at least 11% of that amount in bitcoin reserves," Armstrong posted to X in response to criticism of Trump's plan for a national bitcoin reserve. "And I believe in the next five to 10 years bitcoin's market cap will likely surpass gold. So these reserves should grow to exceed gold." This week, Trump has followed through on his campaign promises to make overhauling crypto policy one of his administration's priorities, ordering the creation of a cryptocurrency working group tasked with proposing new regulations and exploring the creation of a national cryptocurrency stockpile. The group will "evaluate the potential creation and maintenance of a national digital asset stockpile... potentially derived from cryptocurrencies lawfully seized by the Federal Government through its law enforcement efforts." The U.S. currently holds more than 200,000 bitcoin worth around $21 billion along with some smaller cryptocurrencies that have been seized by law enforcement. In December, Trump confirmed he plans to establish a U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve. "We're gonna do something great with crypto because we don’t want China, or anybody else … but others are embracing it, and we want to be ahead," Trump told CNBC. In July, then Republican candidate Donald Trump promised to create a "strategic national bitcoin reserve" and predicted bitcoin could eclipse gold's $18 trillion market capitalization during an appearance at the Bitcoin 2024 conference. Armstrong has endorsed the idea of a U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve, calling it part of a plan that will "bring economic freedom to the world" that comes at a "pivotal moment" in history. "The next global arms race will be in the digital economy, not space," Armstrong wrote.

"Bitcoin could be as foundational to the global economy as gold and will become central to national security in a world where holdings of bitcoin can shift the balance of power among nation states. Governments will race to build strategic bitcoin reserves, securing and uplifting their national economies while those without will lose their footing in the digital age." Meanwhile, speaking to CNBC on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos this week, Armstrong predicted the bitcoin price will top "multiple millions" as the U.S. bitcoin reserve causes the "rest of the G20" to follow suit. "If the U.S. took that path, probably the rest of the G20 would follow," said. "I think bitcoin has a long way to go—it's going to be the new gold standard out there, but crypto is really much bigger than that too." One Community. Many Voices.

We recently published a list of Billionaire Mario Gabelli’s Top 15 Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) stands against other Billionaire Mario Gabelli’s top stock picks. Mario Gabelli is a legendary American investor, renowned for his expertise in value investing and his focus on media, telecommunications, and consumer goods. As the founder and CEO of GAMCO Investors, Gabelli has built a storied career, consistently delivering strong returns for investors while amassing significant wealth. He was born in 1942 in Italy to a family of modest means. His father was a schoolteacher, and the Gabelli family immigrated to the United States when Mario was a child. Settling in the Bronx, Gabelli became fluent in English while excelling academically. He attended Columbia Business School, where he earned his MBA. Gabelli’s early career began at Lyon, Lavey, and Bessemer, where he worked as a financial analyst before moving to Tudor Investment Corporation in the late 1960s. At Tudor, Gabelli developed a deep interest in media and entertainment stocks, recognizing that these sectors were undervalued and ripe for investment. Gabelli’s early years in finance provided him with a solid foundation in analyzing companies, market trends, and financial statements. In 1976, Gabelli founded Gabelli & Company — which would later become Gabelli Asset Management and then GAMCO Investors — with the goal of applying his value investing philosophy to select, often underappreciated companies.

Under Gabelli’s stewardship, the firm has delivered above-market returns, with Gabelli’s flagship Gabelli Equity Fund returning an average annualized return of 13% over several decades. Gabelli is an ardent advocate of value investing, a strategy pioneered by Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett. His approach emphasizes thorough analysis, buying companies at a significant discount to their intrinsic value, and holding them for the long term. One of Gabelli’s most notable achievements was his early recognition of the potential in media companies. He was one of the first investors to spot the potential of CBS, Time Warner, and Viacom, turning those investments into massive successes. Gabelli is particularly well-known for his focus on the telecommunications sectors as well. He has invested in companies like Comcast, Disney, and Liberty Media, often advocating for management changes and strategic restructuring to unlock value.

Title: With 89% ownership in Halma plc (LON:HLMA), institutional investors have a lot riding on the business

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Given the large stake in the stock by institutions, Halma's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions 48% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders Recent sales by insiders A look at the shareholders of Halma plc (LON:HLMA) can tell us which group is most powerful. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 89% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn). Last week’s 4.0% gain means that institutional investors were on the positive end of the spectrum even as the company has shown strong longer-term trends. The gains from last week would have further boosted the one-year return to shareholders which currently stand at 34%. Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Halma, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Halma Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices. Halma already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Halma's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story. Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Halma. Our data shows that BlackRock, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.9% of shares outstanding. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 4.8% of common stock, and FMR LLC holds about 3.1% of the company stock. Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder. Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future. The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO. I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions. Our information suggests that Halma plc insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own UK£7.7m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 10% stake in Halma. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run. I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Be aware that Halma is showing 1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about... But ultimately it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.

Title: Institutional owners may take dramatic actions as Greggs plc's (LON:GRG) recent 5.6% drop adds to one-year losses

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Significantly high institutional ownership implies Greggs' stock price is sensitive to their trading actions The top 18 shareholders own 51% of the company Ownership research along with analyst forecasts data help provide a good understanding of opportunities in a stock If you want to know who really controls Greggs plc (LON:GRG), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 88% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn). As a result, institutional investors endured the highest losses last week after market cap fell by UK£126m. Needless to say, the recent loss which further adds to the one-year loss to shareholders of 18% might not go down well especially with this category of shareholders. Also referred to as "smart money", institutions have a lot of sway over how a stock's price moves. As a result, if the downtrend continues, institutions may face pressures to sell Greggs, which might have negative implications on individual investors. Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Greggs. View our latest analysis for Greggs Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing. As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Greggs. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Greggs' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story. Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Greggs is not owned by hedge funds. BlackRock, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 6.7% of shares outstanding. With 5.3% and 4.3% of the shares outstanding respectively, The Vanguard Group, Inc. and Fiduciary Management, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders. Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 18 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership. Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too. The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves. Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances. Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Greggs plc in their own names. It's a big company, so even a small proportional interest can create alignment between the board and shareholders. In this case insiders own UK£2.0m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 10% stake in Greggs. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run. It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Greggs better, we need to consider many other factors. Be aware that Greggs is showing 1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about...

Title: An Irishwoman’s story of travelling abroad for cosmetic surgery
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/life-style/2025/01/25/an-irishwomans-story-of-travelling-abroad-for-cosmetic-surgery/

There’s something ironic about actor Demi Moore leaving this month’s Golden Globes ceremony with a statuette for her performance as the fading celebrity who succumbs to the ultimate anti-ageing injectable along with an award-ceremony goody bag containing a voucher for a $40,000 cellular facelift. Body-horror film The Substance and its terrifying message about the Faustian deal Moore’s character Elisabeth Sparkle makes to freeze time, may have made a visceral impression on audiences, but it’s unlikely to halt the rise of cosmetic surgery. According to the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery’s annual global survey, both aesthetic and cosmetic procedures are growing year on year, with a 40 per cent increase over the past five years. Liposuction is the most common surgical procedure, followed by breast augmentation, eyelid surgery, abdominoplasty (tummy tuck) and rhinoplasty. While there are no official statistics for Ireland, Liz Dwyer, founder of the Future Beauty Show, a clinical and aesthetic beauty event for consumers, which will run at the RDS on March 1st and 2nd, believes “tweakments” – non-surgical treatments such as injectables, laser and bio-rejuvenations – are as prolific in this country as visits to the hairdresser. In Dwyer’s experience, the majority of both surgical and non-surgical procedures are not vanity-led. “Most of the time, men and women are trying to solve a problem and find a way to deal with something that upsets them. It could be a birthmark, acne, obesity or hair loss caused by anxiety,” she explains. For media professional Claire Craig, it was uneven breasts. She had been deeply unhappy with the irregularities in size and shape of one breast compared with the other for many years, but her insecurities were solidified in 2016 when she went to a well-known department store for a bra fitting. “I was essentially told I was deformed by the sales assistant who suggested that a surgeon could sort me out. I wiped away tears as I walked up the street,” she says. Despite feeling terrified at the prospect of surgery, by 2023 she decided “it’s now or never” so she had a breast augmentation at the Avoca Clinic in Wicklow. The mother-of-one went on to have liposuction on her thighs in November after diet and exercise failed to achieve the results she wanted. She describes the surgeries as life-changing. “I feel really emotional about it. Confidence is everything and feeling good in your own body helps your overall wellbeing,” she says. Craig was quoted €5,000 for liposuction in Ireland but paid half that at the Bangkok Hospital Siriroj in Thailand. Though still in the healing phase, she says she feels great and has no significant pain or problems, just mild fatigue and a little discomfort. She’s back at work now and back in the gym. While she can see some signs of healing and inch loss, it could be the end of February before the full results are visible. Two of Craig’s close friends have also had cosmetic surgery and she says it’s no longer thought of as unusual but is fairly common. Since she has had two procedures herself, I ask about the proverbial slippery slope. “I’m in a good place right now and I realise I can’t continue to do this. I’ve always been very passionate about nutrition and working out so I don’t think that’s a risk for me. Admittedly, when you see the results of surgery you think, ‘God, this is really good,’ but I would weigh that against the recovery time, antibiotics and medication.” Craig was fortunate to have the support of her 20-year-old daughter in Thailand and a childhood friend from Longford who travelled to Phuket from her home in Australia to have a breast augmentation at the same time. Dwyer says that for many people who choose to have surgery abroad, assuming that the surgery has gone as planned, the hardest part is not the surgery itself but the lack of emotional support afterwards. Thirty-six-year-old Lynn Mac travelled alone to Kaunas in Lithuania for a tummy tuck and arm lift in September last year. “I’ve had a lifelong battle with obesity,” she explains. “I’ve lost weight and put it back on over the years and when I finally went on a proper health kick and lost loads of weight, I was left with loose skin and stretch marks.” [ ‘They’ve got these alien features’: The rise of unregulated cosmetic procedures in IrelandOpens in new window ] A psychic medium by profession, Mac admits that although it goes against all common sense, her choice of clinic was based on intuition. “I came across BaltiClinic on Instagram and watched their work for a while, then I met with a surgeon and other staff in Dublin who’d travelled over from Lithuania to chat with prospective clients. They were lovely and I felt no pressure to book.” Mac was in theatre for 3½ hours and the most challenging aspect, she reveals, was being unable to stand up straight for a week afterwards. “I was groggy and my body felt tight when I came out of surgery. I hadn’t realised I would only very gradually be able to straighten up.” She did worry about how she would manage alone when she left the hospital, but her fears didn’t play out. “The hospital staff made sure I was looked after. They took care of all my journeys to and from the hotel, hospital and airport and I had constant contact with the surgeon’s assistant, who was incredible. My family was checking in the whole time too,” she says. The Leixlip native is so happy with the results that she has scheduled a thigh lift and adjustments to her back for later this year at the same clinic. “People argue you should stay in Ireland for cosmetic surgery, but what has Ireland got to offer? We’re not leaders in cosmetic surgery and then there’s the cost.” Mac paid €7,000 for an extended tummy tuck, lipo 360 and an arm lift. She says the same work could cost anything between €15,000 and €20,000 in Ireland. Dwyer agrees the difference in cost at home and abroad is considerable. Brazil is a case in point. “Filler will cost you about €50 there whereas it can cost five times that in Ireland. Every Brazilian I know travels home to stock up on tweakments,” she says. You see every single type of man coming in to get work done, from tradesmen treating the effects of sun damage to grandfathers getting Botox Ms Siún Murphy, consultant plastic surgeon at Dublin’s Blackrock Clinic, warns that patients need to be aware of the vast difference between clinics at home and abroad. “Some are regulated and adhere to modern surgical standards,” she explains, “but sadly many do not. Travelling abroad for surgery is not without its risks and issues, especially with regard to post-operative care. Many patients fly back after long anaesthetics and multiple procedures; all of that travel so soon after a general anaesthetic can compromise their recovery and risk clots. While having these procedures costs more at home, the post-operative care, which is almost more important than the procedures themselves, is all part of the operative package here.” Despite the financial incentive to go abroad, Monica Ivani chose to have her eye lift with Dr Murphy at Dublin’s Blackrock Clinic. Originally from Hungary, the 44-year-old explains that she had a heavily hooded eyelid since childhood. “I wouldn’t say it affected my confidence, but I’m a businesswoman; it’s part of my job to look the best I can.” Ivani, who owns MyBrows Permanent Makeup Academy in Stillorgan in Dublin, says she looks younger and fresher since the eye lift and has no visible scar. [ Cosmetic surgery tourism: Demi Moore’s new film shows what influencer videos won’t – the scalp infections and weeping woundsOpens in new window ] “The surgery took 20 minutes under local anaesthetic and I didn’t feel anything during or after. I had no side effects or bruising and just a little bit of swelling for a few days. You can see it all on my social media account.” Several of Ivani’s friends have had eye lifts in France and England. “Surgery abroad is so much cheaper, but I chose the Blackrock Clinic in case I had complications afterwards.” Ivani believes at least half of her clientele have had work done. “Europeans are a lot more open about the subject,” she says. “Irish people are very private, although that’s beginning to change. I’m very open about it. I think the eye lift was brilliant and I would recommend it to anyone.” Dwyer believes more transparency can only be a good thing. On her podcast Fess Up, she invites individuals in the public eye to get real about everything from mummy makeovers to colonics. “More honesty means greater awareness and this will raise industry standards for everyone.” While Ivani describes herself as “very pro-plastic surgery”, she doesn’t believe in going overboard. “I don’t want to change, I want to look natural and like the best version of myself. After 40, skin becomes looser and signs of ageing become more obvious. I would like to age gracefully – I don’t mind wrinkles, it’s all part of life – but you can’t let yourself go completely.” At 24, Patrick Blue has no need to worry about the ravages of time, yet the creative make-up artist and social media manager has had several aesthetic treatments in cosmetic clinics in Dublin, from lip filler and mesotherapy (injections under the skin to promote loss of fat) to Botox and dermaplaning (scraping off dead skin cells with a scalpel). In November 2022, he had a septoplasty and rhinoplasty in Istanbul at a cost of €2,400; this included surgery, accommodation and transfers. His first tweakment was lip filler at age 18. He thought it would be a fun thing to do with his mum so he treated them both. It was her first time too – and, as it turned out, her last. Blue says she enjoyed the experience but decided needles weren’t for her. The Enniscorthy native reveals all of his peers are investing in their skin now, “especially when it comes to basic stuff like Botox, fillers and boosters”. Although by law in Ireland Botox can only be administered by a doctor, dentist or registered nurse, in recent years, with the increased demand for such procedures, a wider number of health practitioners are diversifying to cater to the growing market. He adds: “Treatments aren’t that expensive any more. One ml of lip filler is €250 and Botox can range from €240 per unit.” The septoplasty was to repair a breathing problem and a blockage in one of his nostrils, but he decided that while he was having it done, he’d have a “minor fix” on his nose. “I was happy with my nose shape, but I thought it could be improved,” he says. Blue spent three years researching clinics before he decided on the Memorial Bahçelievler Hospital. “I had no pain at all after the surgery and the next day I enjoyed a three-hour boat cruise around Istanbul,” he says. Blue has been creating social media content for Dublin aesthetic clinics for the past five years and he says it’s not only common to see mums and daughters attending together but wives accompanying their husbands. “You see every single type of man coming in to get work done, from tradesmen treating the effects of sun damage to grandfathers getting Botox because they want to look good in christening photos. Men are much more conscious of their skin these days.” It’s Halloween night 2024. From beyond the glass at terminal two in Dublin Airport, the city skyline is alight with fireworks – all vision, no sound, the best kind. First stop Dubai; final destination: Phuket, Thailand. Phuket airport is heaving with travellers. Once we get through a long and humid immigration queue, it’s on to the hotel. We stay at Ratana Hotel Rassada, about 20 minutes outside Phuket Old Town. The hotel, which has a 20-metre pool and incredibly friendly staff, costs €30 per night with breakfast included. At Bangkok Hospital Siriroj I meet their wonderful client manager Nokky, who I have been corresponding with over email for several months. On the fourth floor, where the elective surgery consultations take place, I am brought through a series of tests, including X-rays, blood pressure and cardiac checks before being introduced to Dr Jib, who will do my surgery. I have chosen to have Vaser liposuction on my inner thighs. I was quoted €5,500 at home; in Thailand it’s €2,500. The surgery is scheduled for November 5th but pushed back to November 7th when Dr Jib hears I did not stop taking my fish oils as instructed (which can affect blood clotting and bruising). To be safe, we need to wait a few more days until they have left my system. The driver takes me back to the hotel where I feel reassured and impressed by the experience I have just had. Three free days until my surgery so it’s time to explore! Post-surgery, no swimming is allowed as the risk of infection is too high, so it’s time to enjoy Thailand’s beautiful coastal areas. The day of my surgery arrives. I have been fasting from midnight. When my driver collects me at 8am, I take a small overnight bag. While staying overnight is not always necessary, it’s a measure of care given here and reassuring. I meet Dr Jib and see him change from medical maestro to artist as he applies his permanent marker to the areas he will operate on on my body. I am then taken by a nurse to be checked into my private room. The room is bright, white and airy, with two beds. A companion is welcome to stay overnight with you if you request it. It feels like a five-star hotel, with luxury branded toiletries, a stocked fridge and waterfall shower. I feel a little giddy when I step out on the balcony and take in the leafy green garden views. I’m told to begin getting ready and change into a hospital gown – the procedure is scheduled for 11am. [ ‘For many people, plastic surgery is not about vanity at all’Opens in new window ] No nerves till now but they do start to kick in. I feel vulnerable, wearing just a hospital gown, in a foreign country in a strange bed. I am taken in the lift by the medical team to the fifth floor. While the other floors are all quite floral and dreamy, when the fifth floor sealed door is opened, the air is heavier. The faces, while still friendly, have the edge of being a little more serious, which both alarms and reassures me at the same time. I am moved from trolley to operating table. It’s a hive of activity and bright lights, with six or seven people in the room. I feel a bit queasy when I see the surgical instruments being prepared, so I turn my head to look at the black, glossy bulk of the Vaser liposuction machine ready for action. The theatre doors swing open and Dr Jib is scrubbed up and in the room ready for action. He greets me kindly and continues to prep. Next up, the anaesthetist, a man with kind eyes, enters the room. He holds my hand and introduces himself as Peter. We chat and he tells me I’m lovely and friendly and I start to cry, a little overwhelmed with emotion and nerves. He says he is going to put me to sleep, that I’m not to worry about a thing. An injection in my left arm makes me feel tingly. There’s a mask on my face and in less than 90 seconds I am under the sedation spell. It’s nearly 3pm when I wake up back in my hospital room. Dr Jib is at my bedside with a nurse to welcome me back to consciousness with the good news that the operation was a success. “Nearly 700cc from each side,” he says proudly and with the look of man who maybe isn’t used to seeing thighs made of such sustainable stuff. I immediately imagine two cartons of Avonmore pink milk as a reference, and nod in agreement that that’s a fairly impressive amount. Post surgery, I have been dressed in a compression garment, which is essentially a pair of high-waisted, extra-tight leggings which I am to wear day and night for six weeks for best results. My legs are elevated and I am given a device with a button for pain and a button to call a nurse if needed. Despite having zero pain – just minor discomfort – I take advantage of the morphine button and float into a restful, recuperative sleep. I am woken with a menu to choose my meals. I opt for the salmon and mashed potato, which tastes both comforting and nourishing. I sleep well all night and I am nearly a little sad when it’s time to be discharged the next day. It was so lovely to be minded. The nurses help me dress, and I am given antibiotics and painkillers to take back to hotel. I am on my feet and moving slowly and carefully. Client manager Nokky is there to check in on me and make sure I have everything I need. I arrive back to the hotel and sit by the pool with friends to update them on all the news. I’m still a little queasy and suddenly have to lunge to a bin and vomit. I retire to my room after that. While recovering in paradise is lovely, it wouldn’t be possible without air-con. In the days post surgery, I have minor discomfort but no pain. I tire quickly and am swollen (zero results visible yet). I am also on antibiotics so alcohol is out too. The day before my flight home I have my final check-up with Dr Jib. He changes dressings and inspects healing, checks all vitals etc. I am still very bruised and swollen and I am told I must be patient with the results. I feel lighter but am so badly bruised I feel sad – the post-surgery low mood is a real thing. It could be Christmas when swelling will really diminish. My anxiety has been building about the long flight home. Dr Jib writes me a note for the airline and I am to be given an aisle seat to be able to walk freely on flight. The departures area at Phuket airport is so busy it’s bordering on chaotic – this is my lowest moment on my trip. Boarding the flight takes longer than expected and I have to stand for a long period of time in a jostling queue, which I had not anticipated. I had not requested assistance or booked any priority boarding. I would not make this mistake again. I am home for several weeks now and back at work. I became fatigued very quickly for the first 10 days but saw a return to normal energy levels after that. Walking and light household duties are fine but no gym/running for a few more weeks. Still very much in the healing phase but I have started to see some results, which is encouraging. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Authorized participants, aka large institutional investors, would be able to redeem shares of the ETF for the underlying Bitcoin, rather than being forced to sell the Bitcoin via a market maker and deliver cash instead. That's the current status quo, as established when IBIT and other Bitcoin ETFs were approved for trading by the SEC in January 2024, when Joe Biden was president and the regulator was run by crypto skeptic Gary Gensler. But things are changing under the newly inaugurated President Donald Trump, including the departure of Gensler and the creation of an SEC crypto task force that appears focused on creating clear regulation for the industry. On Thursday, the SEC rescinded the controversial crypto accounting rule, called SAB 121, which discouraged banks from taking custody of crypto. But this new rule would significantly streamline the process of redemptions, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, with fewer steps and fewer parties needed to complete a redemption. And without a requirement to redeem for cash, there could be less selling of Bitcoin overall when ETFs are hit with redemption requests. Wow. Way too many questions and this stuff goes pretty deep in the weeds. So i'll keep it high level and answer "What does this mean?" Not all that much for individual retail investors. Mostly what it means is that ETFs should trade even more efficiently than they already do… pic.twitter.com/LWYsKmo5sH — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) January 24, 2025 In a post reply on X, Seyffart pointed to the SAB 121 repeal as a key part of the equation in the proposed ETF rule change. "The side effects from abolishing SAB 121 are likely only just beginning," he suggested.

Title: Why Union Pacific Corporation (UNP) Is Among the Best Humane Stocks to Invest in Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best Humane Stocks to Invest in Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) stands against other best humane stocks to invest in now. In recent years, the investment landscape has seen a significant shift towards socially responsible investing strategies. Among these, humane investing has gained considerable traction. Humane investing is a comprehensive socially responsible investing strategy that encompasses several key aspects. Firstly, it involves the reduction of animal products. This can range from food and fashion to pharmaceuticals and cosmetics, focusing on companies that minimize or eliminate the use of animal products. Secondly, it ensures that businesses respect human rights and address any adverse outcomes. This includes fair labor practices, anti-discrimination policies, and ethical supply chain management. Thirdly, it promotes environmental conservation, such as reducing carbon footprints, sustainable sourcing, and waste reduction. Lastly, it involves shareholder activism, where investors engage with companies to improve welfare practices.

On January 24, Morningstar reported that the landscape of sustainable investing is entering a new era of complexity, characterized by a stark divide between the United States and Europe. This shift was precipitated by a series of significant events, including President Donald Trump’s withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Agreement. The decision underscores a growing divergence in environmental, social, and governance (ESG) priorities, with Europe taking a leading role and the US moving in the opposite direction. Europe has positioned itself as a leader in sustainable investing, with a pledge to achieve “climate neutrality” by 2050, or net-zero emissions. The European Union has also implemented ambitious mandatory ESG and sustainability reporting requirements, setting a high bar for corporate transparency and responsibility. This regulatory framework not only supports sustainable investing but also creates a fertile ground for asset managers to develop and market ESG-focused products with higher profit margins and a global reach. Conversely, the US under the Trump administration has taken a different path. Trump’s inaugural speech signaled a pivot toward promoting fossil fuels and scaling back support for renewable energy sources. This shift is reflected in the actions of major financial institutions, such as the world’s six largest banks withdrawing from a major climate coalition, and BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, pulling out of a similar group. This move is seen as a significant setback by sustainably-minded investors as the financial industry plays a crucial role in financing companies and achieving net-zero emissions targets set by the Paris Agreement. For asset managers, this two-speed world presents both challenges and opportunities. European managers, who operate in a market where sustainability is mainstream, are likely to gain a competitive advantage. They can leverage their expertise in ESG to attract asset owners, such as pension funds and sovereign wealth funds, who are increasingly allocating to ESG-focused strategies. This could lead to a preference for European managers, especially in impact investing, where they can demonstrate greater commitment and expertise. US-based managers, on the other hand, are likely to adopt a more pragmatic approach, aligning their strategies with local market demands and avoiding vocal advocacy for ESG. This “greenhushing” strategy is necessary to navigate the regulatory and political headwinds in the US while maintaining a global presence, particularly in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. As the demand for ethical and sustainable investment options grows, humane investing provides a compelling pathway to drive positive change while achieving financial growth.

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 78 ESG Score: 63 Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) is one of the largest freight rail networks in the United States and operates a vast network spanning 23 western states with over 32,000 miles of track. The company is known for its focus on fuel efficiency, emissions reduction, and community engagement. Union Pacific Corporation’s (NYSE:UNP) long-term sustainability goals align with the growing demand for eco-friendly transportation options. Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) is focusing on expanding mainline and terminal capacities, constructing new sidings, and extending existing ones. These initiatives are especially significant in key growth regions such as the Pacific Northwest, where the company is enhancing its ability to handle soda ash and export grain, and the Southwest, where it is boosting intermodal capabilities. Additionally, the company is investing in advanced technologies such as GPS tracking for containers and rail pulse to improve service reliability, offering customers real-time tracking and enhanced communication. Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) is also diversifying its service offerings to meet the changing demands of its customers. For example, the company recently introduced a new domestic intermodal service that has reduced transit times between Southern California and the Chicago area by two days. This innovation has attracted new customers and strengthened existing relationships. Overall, UNP ranks 4th on our list of the best humane stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential of UNP as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: BlackRock files for ETF rule change to enable in-kind Bitcoin redemptions

BlackRock's proposal for in-kind redemptions may simplify Bitcoin ETF operations and lower tax implications for investors. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Nasdaq has filed an amended rule proposal seeking to introduce in-kind redemptions for BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT), according to a Jan. 24 regulatory filing. The adjustment would allow the exchange-traded fund to transfer Bitcoin (BTC) directly to investors during redemptions instead of converting holdings into cash. The filing outlines plans to expand the ETF’s creation and redemption processes to include in-kind transfers as an alternative to the existing cash model. This method could enhance efficiency and reduce tax burdens for institutional participants. According to the filing: “The proposed in-kind transfer process will be an alternative to the Trust’s current cash creation and redemption process.” The move represents a strategic shift in operational mechanisms for Bitcoin ETFs. The initial cash-based redemption process required issuers like BlackRock to liquidate Bitcoin holdings and return the cash proceeds to investors, a structure that added complexity and potential tax inefficiencies. This update comes amid heightened anticipation for spot Bitcoin ETFs, which gained regulatory approval over a year ago. The debate over in-kind versus cash redemptions has been a key technical consideration for issuers and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), with earlier discussions favoring the cash model for its perceived simplicity and regulatory clarity. The amended filing reflects Nasdaq’s intent to align with market demand for more flexible and investor-friendly ETF operations. If approved, the iShares Bitcoin ETF could set a precedent for other issuers to adopt similar approaches, further advancing the integration of digital assets into traditional financial instruments.

Nasdaq has filed a proposed rule change to allow in-kind creation and redemption for the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), according to a Friday filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The process allows large institutional investors, called authorized participants (APs), to buy and redeem shares of the fund directly to bitcoin (BTC). It is considered to be more efficient as it allows APs to closely monitor the demand for the ETF and act quickly by buying or selling shares of the fund without cash being involved. Retail investors are not eligible to participate. When the SEC first approved spot bitcoin ETFs, including IBIT, last January, the agency allowed the launch of the funds with cash redemption instead of bitcoin. "It should have been approved in the first place but Gensler/Crenshaw didn't want to allow it for a whole host of reasons they gave," Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart wrote on X. "Mainly [they] didn't want brokers touching actual Bitcoin." BlackRock's IBIT is the largest spot BTC ETF on the market, attracting nearly $40 billion of inflows in its first year, making it the most successful ETF debut ever.

Title: Federal Reserve, BlackRock retreat from climate coalitions as economic realities take precedence
URL: https://www.activistpost.com/federal-reserve-blackrock-retreat-from-climate-coalitions-as-economic-realities-take-precedence/
Time Published: 2025-01-24T19:03:00Z

EditorEconomy Natural News, Willow Tohi In a striking shift, major financial institutions and corporations are stepping back from ambitious climate commitments, signaling a growing recognition of the economic costs and impracticalities of such policies. The U.S. Federal Reserve’s withdrawal from the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) and BlackRock’s exit from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative (NZAM) highlight a broader retreat from climate-focused agendas that critics argue have overreached and underdelivered. The Federal Reserve’s decision to leave the NGFS, a coalition of central banks established in 2017 to address climate-related financial risks, underscores its commitment to its core mandate: monetary stability. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly emphasized that climate policy is not within the central bank’s purview. “Climate matters belong to Congress, not the central bank,” Powell stated, reflecting the Fed’s reluctance to engage in politically charged initiatives. The NGFS, initially focused on integrating climate risks into financial oversight, has increasingly embraced broader, more politicized goals, such as promoting green energy agendas. This shift has drawn criticism from those who argue that such efforts conflict with sound economic principles. The Fed’s exit aligns with growing skepticism in the U.S. about the role of financial regulators in climate policy, particularly as these initiatives risk disrupting industries and inflating costs. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has also distanced itself from climate coalitions, withdrawing from the NZAM, which subsequently suspended operations. The NZAM aimed to align financial investments with net-zero carbon emissions goals, but BlackRock’s departure reflects a broader reckoning with the financial and political challenges of such initiatives. The firm faced mounting criticism, particularly from Republican-led states, for prioritizing environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals over fiduciary responsibilities. States like Florida and Texas accused BlackRock of undermining traditional energy industries, while Tennessee successfully challenged the firm in court. These pressures have created a domino effect, with other institutions reconsidering their commitments to net-zero coalitions. The retreat is not limited to financial institutions. Major energy companies, including BP and Shell, have scaled back their green initiatives, prioritizing profitability over ambitious carbon reduction goals. BP recently spun off its offshore wind projects, while Shell cut back on renewable investments and exited power markets in Europe and China. Both companies have signaled a return to traditional energy sources, driven by the economic realities of energy security and profitability. This shift highlights a foundational flaw in climate policy: the failure to account for economic realities. Renewable energy remains heavily reliant on subsidies, while oil and gas continue to drive global economies. Attempts to prematurely phase out fossil fuels without viable alternatives have proven costly, as seen in Europe’s energy crisis. The global retreat from climate commitments reflects a growing recognition of their economic toll. Nations that embraced net-zero goals are now grappling with rising energy prices, faltering economies and public discontent. Germany, once a green energy pioneer, faces skyrocketing electricity costs and industrial flight, while the UK’s climate policies have drawn criticism for burdening households and businesses. In the U.S., the Congressional Budget Office estimates that clean energy subsidies under the Inflation Reduction Act will cost $825 billion over the next decade—far exceeding initial projections. These costs disproportionately impact working-class households, who bear the brunt of higher energy bills and inflation. The unraveling of climate coalitions presents an opportunity to reassess priorities. Policymakers must focus on ensuring energy reliability, affordability and innovation rather than pursuing utopian ideals. The retreat from costly and ineffective climate policies underscores the need for a more rational, economically sound approach to energy and environmental challenges. As institutions like the Federal Reserve and BlackRock step back, the broader public is beginning to question the wisdom of sweeping climate mandates. This shift marks a turning point, one that could pave the way for policies grounded in reality rather than ideology.

Title: 'Too much pessimism' — Fink, Trump and Schwarzman take aim at risk-averse Europe in Davos

The US economy is the toast of Davos, while Europe has been thrown to the wolves at the elite gathering in the Swiss Alps this week. World leaders, business titans, and policy gurus have hailed America's resilient growth, can-do culture, free-flowing capital, and bright prospects if President Trump succeeds in bolstering investment and cutting regulations. In contrast, they called out widespread pessimism, siloed markets, suffocating regulations, and an aversion to taking risks and shouting out successes in Europe. Here are some of the best comments from Davos about Europe: "They're very frustrated because of the time everything seems to take to get approved," Trump said about his European friends and acquaintances. "I love Europe, I love the countries of Europe, but the process is a very cumbersome one, and they do treat the United States of America very, very unfairly with the VAT taxes and all of the other taxes they impose." "There's too much pessimism in Europe," Fink said, based on his conversations with Davos attendees. "I've never felt the pessimism being larger and more profound." "Europe is a myth," he said, calling out its fragmented capital and banking markets, and its lack of dynamism and entrepreneurship relative to countries like the US and China. "I don't see Europe moving forward enough; I see Europe still focusing on backward looking too much." Lagarde said corporate bosses are "not very upbeat" about Europe as they're worried about issues including energy prices and excessive red tape. Their concerns should be a "wake-up call that we Europeans, those in policymaking places, have to really take to heart and respond fast to," she said. "So if the European leaders can actually get their act together, respond to this wake up call and existential threat that can be identified, then I think that there is a huge potential for Europe to respond to the call." Georgieva described the IMF's economic forecast for Europe over the next couple of years as "sort of meh, not great." "United States has a culture of confidence; Europe has a culture of modesty," Georgieva said. She joked the highest praise she ever received from her parents was "not too bad" while in the US, "you just move your legs and you're fantastic, you blink and you're great." "So my advice to my fellow Europeans is more confidence, believe in yourself, and most importantly tell others that you do." Ulbrich, whose company works in real estate and investment management, told Business Insider at Davos that European officials seemed prouder to announce regulations on artificial intelligence than to reveal big investments in the tech. He said that "demonstrates very nicely the difference in culture: The Americans are looking first to the opportunity, and the Europeans tend to look first toward the risk." "A lot of the European businesspeople have expressed enormous frustration with the regulatory regime in the EU," Schwarzman said, adding that they especially blame bureaucracy for slower growth rates in Europe. Kadri said that since she moved to Europe in 2019, there've been "19,000 pages of regulation published just for the chemical industry," and she's been "hiring more people in the legal and compliance departments than in my innovation department." The executive said that small and midsize businesses can't deal with the "soup of alphabet of reporting" requirements, and the bureaucratic burden is "destroying the fabric of the industry." Kadri called for a major simplification of the rules and removal of red tape to improve transparency and predictability, which she said would improve efficiency and drive investment. Jump to

Title: Texas Asks Wall Street Firms for Details About DEI Efforts

Texas and nine other Republican-led states are ratcheting up pressure on Wall Street’s diversity programs, asking firms about their policies on hiring and supplier selections as the Trump administration moves to gut DEI. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton wrote on Thursday to the firms saying they appear to “unlawfully advance discriminatory” diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, and demanded they respond to a series of questions about their programs. He said the companies may have breached their fiduciary duties by pursuing an “ulterior political motive or agenda.” The letter was sent to Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and money manager BlackRock Inc. “You appear to have embraced race- and sex-based quotas and to have made business and investment decisions based not on maximizing shareholder and asset value, but in the furtherance of political agendas,” Paxton said in a letter obtained by Bloomberg. Paxton gave the firms 45 days to respond to the questions. “Before pursuing legal action, we are extending to each of you an opportunity to avoid a lengthy enforcement action,” he wrote. Goldman Sachs and Citigroup declined to comment, while BlackRock and the other banks haven’t provided a response. The letter comes after Trump, in his second day in office, ordered federal contractors to affirm they don’t “engage in illegal discrimination, including illegal DEI.” He directed government agencies to draw up a list of publicly traded companies for potential investigations into compliance violations. JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs’ chief executive officers said on Wednesday that they will continueto focus on efforts to promote DEI in their workforces and customer bases. “We’re going to continue to reach out to the Black community, the Hispanic community, the LGBT community, the veterans community,” JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon said. The attorneys general cited pledges and goals made and set by finance firms since 2021 to bolster hiring of women and minorities. For example, JPMorgan pledged to hire 4,000 Black students by 2024 and Goldman set a goal of spending more than $1 billion on diverse vendors. Corporate America ramped up its diversity efforts in the wake of the MeToo movement and the 2020 death of George Floyd that sparked nationwide unrest. In November, Paxton led a move to sue BlackRock, Vanguard Group Inc. and State Street Corp. for allegedly breaching antitrust laws by using climate investing strategies to suppress coal production. BlackRock said the suggestion that it invested money in companies with the goal of harming them “is baseless and defies common sense.” In Thursday’s letter, Paxton also asked firms about their net zero emissions commitments and use of shareholder votes and conversations with companies to shift away from fossil fuels. For instance, the attorneys general asked BlackRock for details about communications it had with Climate Action 100+, an environmental group, and reasons for backing shareholder proposals focused on climate change. They also asked banks for information related to the steps they have taken to meet net zero goals. Financial firms, including the six cited by Paxton, have quit climate groups since early last month. The attorneys general that joined Paxton in sending the letter to the banks and BlackRock include those from Utah, Iowa, Indiana and Alabama. Topics Texas

Title: How the Fed’s latest decision could affect crypto markets in 2025

Time Published: 2025-01-24T17:26:57Z

Bitcoin may have kicked off 2025 with a rebound back to $100,000, but since the release of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s December 2024 Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Jan. 8, the BTC/USD exchange rate dropped to as low as $91,220.84. Bitcoin has stabilized at around $95,000 since then, but concerns run high whether further news about the future direction of interest rates and monetary policy will result in an additional negative impact to the performance of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. As cryptocurrencies have entered the financial mainstream, they have become increasingly sensitive to policy changes from the Federal Reserve. With this in mind, let’s take a closer look at the latest news from the Fed, and see what it could mean for the performance of both Bitcoins and altcoins in the months ahead. As revealed in the aforementioned Fed meeting minutes, the central bank once again cut interest rates by 0.25%, or 25 basis points. This was in line with expectations. However, while the latest rate cuts arrived as expected, other takeaways from the meeting minutes caught investors off-guard. Namely, the Fed’s signaling of its plans to reduce the number of 25-basis point rate cuts in 2025. Before the meeting minutes hit the street, the market was still expecting four such cuts throughout the year. The latest remarks from Fed officials regarding quantitative tightening also suggested that the “Fed pivot” this year will not be as rapid of a shift from hawkish to dovish as previously anticipated. Taking this into account, it’s not completely surprising that Bitcoin has once again encountered negative volatility. Nor is it surprising that more volatile altcoins, like Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin, have all experienced double-digit declines over the past week. As “risk-on” assets, cryptocurrencies, especially altcoins, perform better during times of accommodative fiscal policy. Yet while the Fed may be not turning as dovish as previously expected, and is in fact continuing to engage in monetary tightening, the impact of these policy decisions on cryptocurrency prices in 2025 may not be as dire as it seems at first glance. Although the cryptocurrency market reacted negatively to the Fed’s current policy gameplan, said plans could still result in further upside for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. For one, the planned implementation of fewer 25 basis-point rates still means a further loosening of monetary policy, helping to justify additional upside for this “risk-on” asset class. Second, with regards to Bitcoin, other positive factors are at play that could drive further upside for the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. These include increased institutional and retail investor allocation, as well as the specter of a more favorable crypto regulatory environment from the incoming Trump administration. Binance CEO Richard Teng commented on what we can expect in the crypto industry in 2025, “We expect to see development across all aspects. Crypto regulation saw great growth across the world in 2024 and we expect to see more in 2025. Given the recent U.S. presidential election and expected crypto regulation from its new government, we expect to see other countries follow the lead from the U.S. and enact more legislation across the world.” Teng continues, “In terms of institutional interest, financial giants like BlackRock and Fidelity entered the crypto business in 2024, and we expect to see more new players next year. More companies are learning about crypto and integrating crypto features like tokenization into their business. This is a trend that has grown for years and we expect to see more development in.” Admittedly, the recently-announced changes to the Fed’s rate cut plans could still negatively impact the performance of altcoins in the short-term. Altcoins are much more sensitive to changes in fiscal policy. Nevertheless, if a bull market continues in Bitcoin, chances are it will spill over into the altcoin space as well. Investors profiting from a continued run up in the price of Bitcoin could cycle their gains into Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and other major and emerging altcoins. Over a longer timeframe, the Fed’s decision to more cautiously lower interest rates and loosen fiscal policy may do little to threaten the long-term bull case for cryptocurrencies. Due to a variety of trends, including the proliferation of exchange-traded cryptocurrency investment products, institutional and retail capital inflows into cryptocurrencies are poised to continue. Of course, nothing’s for certain. For instance, following the latest jobs report, there is growing doubt whether the Fed will further walk back its 2025 rate cut plans. Even if the Fed sticks to its current plan, this asset class is likely to stay highly volatile. Caution and patience remain key. Nevertheless, taking into account not just the Fed news,but the other positive trends at play as well, the opportunity for long-term price appreciation with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is still on the table.

Title: Achieve Life Sciences, Inc. (ACHV): A Bull Case Theory

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We came across a bullish thesis on Achieve Life Sciences, Inc. (ACHV) on Substack by Jacob Rowe. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on ACHV. Achieve Life Sciences, Inc. (ACHV)'s share was trading at $3 as of Jan 23rd. Copyright: nedoba / 123RF Stock Photo Achieve Life Sciences (ACHV) presents a compelling investment opportunity, with its nicotine cessation drug, Cytisinicline, positioned to disrupt the market. The company has reached a significant milestone in its development, completing a six-month safety study involving 300 patients without any safety concerns, paving the way for an NDA submission in April/May. As Cytisinicline holds breakthrough designation, the likelihood of a priority review is high, particularly given its superior efficacy and safety profile compared to Chantix, the previous category leader now available as a generic. This positions Achieve for substantial upside potential, especially as the stock currently trades near 52-week lows despite being de-risked. Cytisinicline’s data from multiple Phase 3 trials underscores its efficacy, with odds ratios significantly outperforming Chantix. For example, while Chantix achieved an odds ratio of 2.88 over a 12-week trial, Cytisinicline demonstrated odds ratios between 5.0 and 6.3 in comparable trials, alongside fewer side effects. Its safety profile closely mirrors typical nicotine withdrawal symptoms, further solidifying its appeal. With an expected price point of $700–$800, Cytisinicline could capture a significant share of the $1 billion-plus nicotine cessation market. Even a conservative 30% market share implies $300 million in annual revenue, supporting a valuation of approximately $1 billion at 3x sales. A 60% share would push revenue to $600 million and valuation to $1.8 billion, representing a potential 5x–10x return for investors based on the current diluted share count. The timeline for additional catalysts is clear. Results from the ongoing one-year safety study, which involves 100 patients continuing from the initial cohort, are expected by mid-year, further de-risking the investment. Achieve’s strategic positioning, bolstered by its new investment banking board members and a cash runway through Q3 2025, increases the probability of a buyout in 2025. Moreover, priority review could lead to a PDUFA date in Q4 2024, potentially driving a sharp valuation rerating as biopharma funds recognize the mismatch between market price and intrinsic value. With its transformative potential and favorable risk/reward profile, Achieve Life Sciences stands as a strong candidate for multi-bagger returns. Achieve Life Sciences, Inc. (ACHV) is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 6 hedge fund portfolios held ACHV at the end of the third quarter which was 7 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of ACHV as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ACHV but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

A version of this article originally appeared in Quartz’s Need to Know: Davos newsletter. To get updates on the World Economic Forum delivered straight to your inbox, sign up here. After a week dominated by President Donald Trump’s shadow and tariff tensions, Davos 2025 wrapped up with a subdued final day, giving the world’s elite a chance to catch their breath and focus on the broader picture. One of the final panels brought together the world’s top economic voices for a reality check. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink pushed back against European pessimism, saying that “the economy is larger than any one political party.” European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde pointed to Europe’s “huge potential” in GDP, talent, and savings, urging leaders to “respond to this wake-up call and existential threat.” Both Lagarde and IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva emphasized AI’s crucial role in growth. “Make sure that artificial intelligence is not a privilege of few,” Georgieva urged. Lagarde said that AI’s potential is “huge,” but that it must “improve the state of the world, for all of us.” Georgieva also zeroed in on productivity as the key differentiator between U.S., European, and emerging market growth. Her prescription for lagging regions? “Capital has to have long legs and go where it makes the biggest difference,” she said, with a particular call for Europe to deepen its capital markets. All of these themes echoed through the week at the World Economic Forum: Europe’s challenges and potential, AI’s promise and perils, and the ever-present question of American influence. The gathering’s official theme, “Collaboration for the Intelligent Age,” took on new meaning with each passing day. Monday opened with European leaders defending democracy and climate action against Trump’s America First agenda. By midweek, his virtual appearance laid out a second-term vision from tariffs to his $500 billion “Stargate” AI project, while Meta’s moderation retreat and Spain’s call for digital ID requirements highlighted the growing rift over tech governance. NATO chief Mark Rutte surprised many by embracing Trump’s Russia stance, while WTO head Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala urged everyone to “chill” about tariffs. Even JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon and Norway’s sovereign wealth fund chief agreed on one thing: Trump’s return was awakening Wall Street’s “animal spirits.” Through it all, one message remained clear: Whether it’s AI access, trade policy, or capital markets, the push-and-pull between cooperation and competition will define 2025 — Trump’s version of it, anyway.

Title: This week's meme coin mania sparked a wave of unauthorized tokens looking to cash in on the frenzy
URL: https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/trump-crypto-meme-coin-rally-melania-barron-ivanka-sorkin-bitcoin-2025-1
Time Published: 2025-01-24T16:41:16Z
Full Content:
Trump's meme coin was the talk of the crypto market this week, and its success sparked a wave of unofficial tokens looking to woo investors with the promise of swift gains. The frenzy began shortly after Donald and Melania Trump launched their own meme tokens, $Trump and $Melania, the weekend before the inauguration. Those coins attracted a rush of retail money — much of it from first-time crypto buyers — as well as some big money "whales." As their prices went parabolic, it didn't take long for imitators to crop up, with issuers minting new tokens bearing the names of high-profile figures. A meme coin named after Ivanka Trump quickly climbed 275%, according to CoinMarketCap data, with the coin spiking the morning of the presidential inauguration. However, unlike the official Trump and Melania tokens, $Ivanka is not affiliated with anyone in the Trump family. Ivanka Trump took to social media on Thursday to warn her followers about the crypto coin, adding that her legal team would be pursuing measures to "stop the continued misuse" of her name. "It has come to my attention that a fake crypto coin called 'Ivanka Trump' or '$IVANKA' is being promoted without my consent or approval," the first daughter wrote on X. "To be clear: I have no involvement with this coin. This fake coin risks deceiving consumers and defrauding them of their hard-earned money." The coin has plummeted 45% in the last 24 hours. Then there was a coin that invoked the name of Barron Trump, the president's youngest son. The price of $Barron coin soared rapidly amid a cocktail of social media hype and misinformation, garnering a market value of more than $450 million. However, when it became clear that the token had no official connection to anyone in the Trump camp, the price plunged as much as 95%. CNBC anchor and DealBook editor Andrew Ross Sorkin was another target of meme coin madness. "Sorkincoin" hit the market shortly after the journalist's talk with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, during which they joked that someone should create a coin inspired by Sorkin. Sure enough, a token bearing his name was minted soon after. Sorkincoin topped $170 million in trading volume in 24 hours, CoinMarketCap data shows, and Sorkin only found out about the crypto when a friend texted him about it, he told "Squawk Box" on Friday. "I was going to say, strangely flattering, but completely unauthorized. We don't know who created it. It's just a very strange thing to watch this thing go," he added. The week's meme coin mania caps off a heady few months for the crypto space since President Trump won the election last November. Trump, who was branded the "crypto president" while on the campaign trail, unleashed a burst of optimism for cryptocurrencies in hopes that the new administration would loosen regulation of the space and even get the government involved in bitcoin by establishing a national reserve. A long-awaited executive order on Thursday was light on specifics, however. Notably, while it addressed the potential creation of a national crypto stockpile, it didn't indicate that the government would necessarily be buying digital assets. Instead, it said a group would examine the potential for a reserve "derived from cryptocurrencies lawfully seized by the Federal Government through its law enforcement efforts." Elsewhere, the order was mainly related to the promotion of technology and clear regulations meant to support the space. Some on Wall Street have voiced skepticism over the exuberance that has gripped crypto recently. David Einhorn, the founder of hedge fund Greenlight Capital, noted that the market has entered the "fartcoin" stage of the cycle, wherein meme coins proliferate. "Nothing stops the launch of many more tradable coins," Einhorn wrote in his quarterly letter to investors. "It's anyone's guess as to what will happen next, but it feels like it's going to be wild."

(Tennessee Office of the Attorney General) R.E. Wermus Reeve Wermus is a journalism intern for The Daily Signal. Jonathan Skrmetti is on a winning streak. Tennessee’s attorney general is hoping it continues all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. Skrmetti announced Thursday his latest win, a $7.4 billion settlement with members of the Sackler family and Purdue Pharma for fueling the opioid epidemic. Tennessee was among the 15 states that accused the company of creating a crisis across America that led to opioid addictions and overdose deaths. A week earlier, Skrmetti won a consumer protection lawsuit against BlackRock, ensuring that Tennesseans’ retirement funds will no longer be used to support the environmental, social, and governance agenda. “Tennessee beats ESG!” Skrmetti wrote on X. “BlackRock’s stringent obligations under this settlement ensure Tennesseans will not see their retirement funds used to support radical ideologies they oppose. Transparency and accountability guarantee consumers an informed choice.” Tennessee beats ESG!BlackRock's stringent obligations under this settlement ensure Tennesseans will not see their retirement funds used to support radical ideologies they oppose. Transparency and accountability guarantee consumers an informed choice.… pic.twitter.com/x49nE5BFFO Those victories might eventually pale in comparison to a case currently before the U.S. Supreme Court, which will decide if states can protect minors from transgender medical procedures. As the Supreme Court deliberates the groundbreaking case, U.S. v. Skrmetti, the attorney general spoke to Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts on his weekly podcast “The Kevin Roberts Show.” The court is expected to rule on the case at the end of its term in June. Skrmetti and Roberts discussed a wide range of topics, from combating the ESG movement in Tennessee to his recent victory halting the Biden administration’s rewrite of Title IX. He detailed his concerns with the regulatory approach of the Biden administration, saying, “I think the apotheosis of that overreach has been the Title IX rule.” Title IX was enacted in 1972 to prohibit sex-based discrimination in schools and education programs that receive federal funding. Starting under the Obama administration and continuing during President Joe Biden’s reign, Democrats have attempted to use Title IX to advance their gender ideology agenda. That came to a halt Jan. 9 when a federal court in Kentucky ruled that the U.S. Department of Education’s Title IX rule was unconstitutional. The Biden administration would have required educators to use pronouns inconsistent with a student’s sex and allowed students to use facilities that do not align with their sex. The case, called Tennessee v. Cardona, marked another major win for Skrmetti and Alliance Defending Freedom. Skrmetti, who sought to protect minors from LGBTQ+ ideology, called Biden’s effort a “totalitarian intrusion into every American school and university.” He explained how making major changes to American law through the current regulatory process bypasses key democratic principles. “You eliminate the need for consensus, you eliminate the transparency, you eliminate the public participation in the process, and ultimately, you alienate Americans from their government,” he warned. The attorney general hopes Tennessee v. Cardona and other regulatory cases brought by attorneys general will “force structural change in the approach of every executive branch.” When asked how America can continue to keep its system of law working, Skrmetti said, “When you look at the size and scope of the executive branch, Congress doesn’t have the muscle to exert real oversight.” He told Roberts that Congress does not have the necessary expertise to author “complicated legislation,” too often deferring instead to executive branch agencies. Watch the full episode of “The Kevin Roberts Show” to hear Skrmetti discuss the fight against government overreach, protecting minors from transgender ideology, and the ongoing U.S. v. Skrmetti case. Trust in the legacy media is at an all-time low. That’s because they are out of touch, deliberately lie to the American public, and ignore conservative audiences.

Title: Why Is George Soros Bullish On Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (EPD) Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Billionaire George Soros' Long-Term Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD) stands against George Soros' long-term stock picks. George Soros is one of the most influential figures in finance, philanthropy, and global affairs. As the founder of Soros Fund Management and the Open Society Foundations, Soros has achieved monumental success as a hedge fund manager while using his wealth to champion democratic values, human rights, and social causes worldwide. Soros was born in Hungary during World War II, and his family survived Nazi occupation by securing false identities and hiding from persecution. In 1947, Soros fled Hungary and moved to England, where he studied at the London School of Economics. After graduating in 1952, Soros worked in various merchant banks before moving to the United States. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Soros began his career in finance in New York City, where he gained experience in arbitrage and securities trading. In 1970, he founded Soros Fund Management, which later became the Quantum Fund, one of the most successful hedge funds in history. Between 1970 and 2000, the Quantum Fund generated an average annual return of over 30%, making it one of the best-performing funds in history. In 1992, Soros became famous as the man who broke the Bank of England. He bet against the British pound, anticipating that it would be devalued due to economic pressures. His position netted him a profit of $1 billion in a single day, cementing his status as a legendary investor. As of the end of the third quarter of 2024, his net worth is estimated at $7.2 billion. The 13F portfolio of his hedge fund is worth more than $6.9 billion. Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. For this article, we selected stocks by combing through the 13F portfolio of Soros Fund Management at the end of the third quarter of 2024. Only the companies that have been in the 13F portfolio of the fund consistently for the past three years were selected. These stocks are also popular among other hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Aerial view of a refinery tower surrounded by the sprawling landscape of pipelines in an oil & gas midstream facility. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 25 Soros Fund Management's Stake: $5.5 million Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD) is a midstream natural gas and crude oil pipeline company with headquarters in Houston, Texas. The following key aspects make this company a standout investment. Firstly, as per the report of the fourth quarter of 2024, the reported net income attributable to common unitholders was $1.4 billion, or $0.65 per unit on a fully diluted basis. This portrays that the company is effectively improving its earnings per unit, reflecting operational efficiency and potentially leading to increased returns for shareholders. Also, an 8% increase was observed compared to $1.3 billion, or $0.60 per unit on a fully diluted basis, for the third quarter of 2023, demonstrating positive financial health and the company’s ability to attract more capital. Secondly, the company declared a quarterly distribution of $0.54 per common unit, maintaining its commitment to returning value to unitholders. This unit repurchase program shows the company’s approach to capital management, which would further enhance unitholder value through these buybacks. Overall EPD ranks 13th on our list of George Soros' long-term stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of EPD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a stock that is more promising than EPD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

According to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, shares of NuScale Power (NYSE: SMR) jumped as much as 34.5% this week before settling in at a 27.3% move higher, Uranium Energy (NYSEMKT: UEC) jumped 19.9% at its peak and closed 13.1% higher for the week, and Powell Industries (NASDAQ: POWL) was up 14.2% and ended 11.3% higher. The topic on everyone's mind this week, besides the inauguration, was the announcements around artificial intelligence. Microsoft started the new year with a small gain year to date, then lost it in recent weeks. This story will assess fundamental, technical and institutional sponsorship criteria on the veteran tech giant and long-term leader of the stock market. Following the three-day MLK national holiday, the leader in cloud computing, enterprise software, gaming consoles and computing hardware underperformed a broad and bullish stock market advance, edging 0.1% lower on Tuesday to 428.50 in above-average turnover. While several chip stocks had convincing performances in 2024, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) were not among them. Intel shares fell about 60% last year, while AMD shares were down about 18%. In a semiconductor market largely being driven by artificial intelligence (AI), Intel and AMD have largely been afterthoughts. LRCX's fiscal second-quarter results are expected to reflect the benefits of a rebound in the semiconductor industry and improving memory spending. The semiconductor market is poised to expand in 2025. Investors, thus, should keep a tab on stocks NVIDIA and TSMC but avoid Advanced Micro Devices. Here's why - A Wall Street analyst who was on the sidelines of Netflix stock during its big run-up in the past year has finally turned bullish on the streaming video leader. US stocks closed lower afer the S&P 500 touched an intraday record high early in the day. As tariff worries eased, mixed company news took focus.

Title: What does OpenAI get from Stargate? A $500 billion chance to build a whole new moat.

OpenAI has a new $500 billion project called Stargate. Consider it an extraordinary attempt by the ChatGPT maker to build itself a whole new moat in the face of growing competition from rivals at home and a buzzy startup in China. This week, OpenAI revealed plans to shift focus and spend $500 billion on AI infrastructure over the next four years. Stargate will focus on hardware powering advanced AI software, such as data centers and energy supply — all with Donald Trump's blessing. It is a colossal amount of money, but OpenAI has two critical reasons for spearheading the initiative alongside key partners SoftBank, Microsoft, and Oracle. First, reaching what OpenAI boss Sam Altman calls an era of "superintelligence" depends on having access to more computing power. The industry insists that AI models will get smarter when given more of it, making ownership and access a priority. Stargate, then, offers OpenAI a chance to build itself the kind of formidable "moat" that Warren Buffett once said companies need to ensure they maintain a competitive advantage against rivals. A vast infrastructure empire belonging to OpenAI would certainly help give it that. The second reason for betting big on infrastructure through Stargate is even more critical: OpenAI may have no choice but to build itself a new moat in response to a Chinese startup that this week caused a stir in Silicon Valley. When OpenAI first introduced ChatGPT to the world, it was clear that the combination of a powerful AI model and an intuitive, consumer-friendly interface gave it a moat that was the envy of Silicon Valley. How much of a moat ChatGPT offers OpenAI has come under increasing debate. The latest challenge to OpenAI's moat came on Monday as a little-known Chinese startup called DeepSeek stunned America's top AI researchers after revealing a new AI model called R1. In a paper, it said R1 rivals the frontier AI model OpenAI introduced just four months ago, o1. Like o1, it reasons, meaning it thinks carefully before responding. According to DeepSeek, which has obtained an MIT license to open-source its model, R1 achieves "performance comparable to OpenAI o1 across math, code, and reasoning tasks." That an open-source Chinese company has been able to release a free model competitive with the best OpenAI has to offer has not gone unnoticed among AI's most prolific leaders. Jonathan Ross, the CEO and founder of Groq, an Nvidia rival backed by BlackRock and Samsung, responded to a question in Davos this week about DeepSeek's latest release by claiming "open models will win." "We cannot do closed models anymore and be competitive — open always wins," the former Google engineer said while noting that it will be harder to differentiate between models soon. As he put it, "The models are not going to be particularly special for long." Gary Marcus, a cognitive scientist and AI researcher, told Business Insider that he has been adamant for a year now that "closed source players have almost no obvious moat" and that it is "certainly even more true now" following DeepSeek's release. It's not the first time OpenAI's moat has been challenged. In May 2023, when Google was busy playing catch up to ChatGPT, an internal memo written by an engineer inside the search giant, published by research firm SemiAnalysis, warned that "we have no moat, and neither does OpenAI." Why? Because, in the engineer's view, the gap in capabilities between the models being worked on in Silicon Valley versus the open-source community was "closing astonishingly quickly." We are, of course, almost two years on from the warning issued in that memo, and OpenAI has since then convinced investors that it is of market-leading value, having completed a $6.6 billion funding round at a $157 billion valuation in October. Nathan Benaich, founder and general partner of AI-focused venture capital firm Air Street Capital, offered Business Insider one explanation for why OpenAI has retained favor, noting ChatGPT has things like ease of use and reliability that make it a top pick for customers. "OpenAI, I think, has won the spot of being CocaCola for consumers," he said. "Who is the Pepsi? The gap is large." Avijit Ghosh, an applied policy researcher at Hugging Face, doubled down on the point, telling Business Insider that while DeepSeek's R1 performance "challenges conventional wisdom about technical moats in frontier AI," he thinks the reality is more nuanced. "The real differentiation isn't in raw model performance anymore — it's in how these capabilities are integrated into practical applications and systems, and tech behemoths are still leagues ahead in being able to vertically integrate and commodify their models into products," he said. OpenAI offered a demonstration of this on Thursday following the release of Operator — an AI agent that serves as an assistant capable of booking everything from dinner reservations to travel. This is clearly impressive, but resting competitive advantage on AI agents and an easy-to-use interface may still not be enough in the face of an entire industry making "agentic AI" its focus. The AI industry's pace of innovation is relentless. Stargate offers OpenAI a chance to build a new moat that could well be tougher to replicate than a large language model or AI agent for a few reasons. For one, having more computing power is vital to scaling models to greater levels of intelligence, experts say. Dylan Patel, founder of research firm SemiAnalysis, told Business Insider: "Stargate is extremely important for OpenAI to be competitive because the access to compute is what enables them to keep scaling." Groq's Ross, meanwhile, told a panel in Davos that he sees access to infrastructure being so important in the future that "what countries are going to be tussling over is how much compute they have access to." If OpenAI does manage to get Stargate built, it seems it will do so to serve its own purposes. A report from the Financial Times this week said Stargate will exclusively serve OpenAI — a sign that the project is meant to give the company an edge. OpenAI did not respond to multiple requests for comment from Business Insider. Clearly, then, the Stargate announcement suggests OpenAI sees a chance to build a new moat. It just can't be expected to come easy. Futurum Group CEO Daniel Newman noted that while the project is likely to work as a VC play, where the outcome is expected to be delivered at an unknown date in the future after serious investment, "raising $500 billion is going to be a real challenge." OpenAI remains lossmaking, and its key Stargate partners, like SoftBank and Oracle, the main equity funders alongside the UAE's MGX, have cash on hand that falls far short of the $100 billion initially being deployed. From a sheer capital position, a new moat won't be cheap. Building the data centers and clean energy sources forming this new moat will require nationwide coordination spanning multiple initial technology partners, including Microsoft, Nvidia, Oracle, OpenAI, and Arm. Construction of a data center site in Texas is underway, but the project will need to go much further. Hugging Face's Ghosh also thinks the "'compute is everything' narrative misses the mark," as small teams like Deepseek have shown "remarkable results through clever engineering." Still, OpenAI seems ready to go all in on Stargate to build a new moat. Its future leadership in the industry may well depend on its success. Jump to

Investing.com -- Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), has suggested that it might be time to reinvest in Europe, citing an overabundance of pessimism about the region. His comments were made during the World Economic Forum's annual meeting on Friday. The Euro zone has seen a modest return to growth at the start of the new year, according to a survey released on the same day. This growth is attributed to stable services activity in January and a reduction in the long-standing downturn in manufacturing. Fink voiced his views during a panel discussion on the global economic outlook in Davos. He stated that there was "too much pessimism on Europe." His belief is that it might be the right time to start investing again in Europe, although he also acknowledged that there was still progress to be made, particularly in areas such as the capital markets union.

DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) -There is too much pessimism around Europe and it could be time to be investing back in the region, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) CEO Larry Fink said at the World Economic Forum annual meeting on Friday. Euro zone business began the new year with a modest return to growth as stable services activity in January was complemented by an easing of the long-running downturn in manufacturing, a survey released earlier on Friday showed. "There's too much pessimism on Europe," Fink said during a panel debate on the global economic outlook in Davos. "I believe it's probably time to be investing back into Europe," he said, adding there was still progress to be made in areas such as capital markets union. On the same panel, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva and ECB President Christine Lagarde agreed Europe needed to better mobilise capital to boost its economy. "We need to keep the talents at home, we need to keep the savings at home," said Lagarde, who characterised the global economic challenges facing Europe as Donald Trump's new presidency begins as representing "an existential threat". "If European leaders can get their act together and respond to this existential threat, there is a huge potential for Europe to respond to the call," she said. Speaking about the outlook for U.S. inflation, BlackRock's Fink said he was not too worried, adding that the U.S. Treasury yield curve reflected expectations for higher inflation and also fiscal deficits. The benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield, trading at 4.64%, has risen from lows of around 3.60% in September. "I can see a scenario, I am not calling for it, where we see 5.5% on the 10-year (U.S.) yields," Fink said.

Title: DWS CEO Steps in as Private Credit Unit Struggles to Lure Cash

(Bloomberg) -- A few months into his role as chief executive officer of Deutsche Bank AG’s asset management unit, Stefan Hoops presented shareholders his vision for growth with a “private debt muscle” as one key part of the strategy. Almost three years on, that plan is sputtering. Frankfurt-based DWS Group is struggling to attract sizable commitments from investors for a private credit fund targeting €1 billion ($1.05 billion), according to a person familiar with the matter. Meanwhile, some senior sales staff have been heading to the exit because the pay is higher at US rivals, several other people said. With his blueprint to tap the hot $1.6 trillion market for private credit failing to take off, Hoops, 44, now plans to dedicate more of his time to give the business a much-needed boost, another person said. One idea being considered is to more strongly leverage parent Deutsche Bank’s client relationships for direct lending, that person added. All the people who spoke with Bloomberg News asked not to be identified because the information they discussed is private. DWS is among newcomers struggling to make a mark in the increasingly crowded private credit space, where even BlackRock Inc., the world’s largest asset manager, has turned to acquisitions to rapidly scale up in a global market that Moody’s anticipates will grow to $3 trillion by 2028. But for some traditional active fund managers, the allure of high returns and management fees is turning into a mirage in the absence of such deals. Last year, Fidelity International halted its European direct lending activities and trimmed its private markets team. On the other hand, US alternatives giant Ares Management Corp. announced this month that it raised €30 billion for its latest European direct lending fund, the largest of its kind in the region. A representative for DWS declined to comment. Prior to joining DWS as CEO in June 2022, Hoops had little experience in asset management. He was brought in to steady the ship after a period of tumult surrounding allegations that the investment firm overstated its green credentials. Now the faltering private credit business has come as a major setback for him. At Deutsche Bank, Hoops caught the attention of CEO Christian Sewing with his cool head when Germany’s biggest lender was facing the threat of a costly settlement in the US. As head of the corporate clients unit that was central to Sewing’s turnaround plan, Hoops oversaw a rebound in the business that was struggling for a long time with negative interest rates. Hoops also scored some wins at DWS, including settling with US regulators probing allegations of greenwashing. He oversaw a 16% rise in total assets under management to €963 billion at the end of September, driven by inflows into lower-margin passively managed funds. The company’s shares have outperformed European peers in recent years. Now, those credentials will be put to the test as Hoops faces one of the biggest challenges of his career: establishing the firm’s private credit business. The alternatives unit of DWS, which is reporting full-year results on Jan. 30, looks unlikely to achieve its goal of a 10% compounded annual growth until the end of 2025, analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg show. The unit had €106 billion in assets under management at the end of September, down from €123 billion in 2022, when Hoops took over. The only bright spot of the alternatives unit in recent years has been its infrastructure business, which has attracted consistent inflows. In a bid to build out the unit, the firm did make some star hires. Paul Kelly joined from Blackstone Inc. in 2022 to run the alternatives unit. It also brought in Man Group Plc’s Dan Robinson as its EMEA alternative credit head. The business is currently launching its first collateralized loan obligation, Rhine CLO I. To be sure, Hoops told analysts in October that he expects the investments in alternatives to pay back over the longer term and promised a “packed agenda” for 2025. But the lack of fundraising has weighed on the business. A weak track record is making it even more difficult to mobilize capital, the people said. Getting clients to invest in DWS’s private credit offerings is also challenging because most customers prefer better established players over the new kid on the block, one person said. As a result, the division has seen some attrition among sales staff. Nestanlin Garcia, who oversaw alternatives client coverage in Germany, Austria and central eastern Europe, left for Blackstone in November. Alexander Hütteroth, who oversaw private debt coverage in the region, joined Brookfield Asset Management, their LinkedIn profiles show. Should organic growth fail to materialize, Hoops might revisit a list of potential acquisition targets of European asset managers with direct lending capabilities. Any deal size would be in the low to mid-single digit billion range, Bloomberg News has reported. DWS has also been among suitors that were studying a bid for German life insurance consolidator Viridium Group. The group of potential bidders also included BlackRock Inc. and Blackstone, Bloomberg News reported in October. More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com ©2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Crypto venture capital (VC) funding is expected to recover this year as regulatory clarity and more crypto-friendly policies emerge during the tenure of President Donald Trump, JPMorgan (JPM) said in a research report Wednesday. The Wall Street bank noted that venture funding for the industry has been subdued in recent years. This may have been due to enforcement actions by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the climate of regulatory uncertainty during the previous administration, analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote. The start of the EU's Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulations, which came into force at the end of December, is expected to "further bolster VC engagement," the report said. Still, the level of funding is unlikely to match previous peaks seen in 2021/22, JPMorgan said, as crypto venture capital firms face a number of challenges. Giants of traditional finance (TradFi) such as Blackrock (BLK) and Franklin Templeton are increasing their participation in the crypto market, and this leaves less market share for VC firms in stablecoins, tokenization and decentralized finance (DeFi), the bank said. Nascent crypto projects are avoiding large token sales to VCs and are increasingly turning to community-driven platforms to raise money, the report noted. High interest rates also present a challenge for VC funding, JPMorgan said. The growth of cryptocurrency exchange-traded fund (ETF) products is "inducing a trend towards passive investing," and this could be diverting capital away from VC firms, the report added.

ROME (Reuters) - Italian bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS)'s all-share buyout offer for Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY) on Friday is the latest surprise twist of an increasingly complex banking saga. Long-awaited Italian banking consolidation has taken off in recent months, triggered by the state selling down its stake in MPS in November, paving the way for a third big banking group to compete with Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY) and UniCredit. The latter, not wanting to be left out of a wave of deal making, late last year made its own unsolicited play for Banco BPM, Italy's third-largest lender. The situation is made more complex by key shareholders in the banks involved owning stakes in other lenders as well as Italian insurer Generali (BIT:GASI).

Several parties are in contention even as potential buyers face a litany of legal hurdles and barriers. After stepping in to restore TikTok in the U.S. and delaying a law that would effectively ban the app, Trump is looking for avenues to keep the popular platform afloat. He has put forward a proposal for an American stakeholder to buy the company and then sell a 50% stake to the U.S. government, which will jointly run the app along with the private party. So, who are the likely contenders for one of the most popular apps in the U.S.? Trump has already flagged several major investors within his inner circle as acceptable buyers, one of which is Tesla and SpaceX owner Elon Musk. The world's richest person is leading Trump's new Department of Government Efficiency, has close business ties to China and has voiced opposition to the TikTok ban. Bloomberg reported earlier this month that the Chinese government was considering a plan to have Musk acquire TikTok's U.S. operations, citing anonymous sources. That followed a report from the Wall Street Journal, which claimed TikTok's CEO had been soliciting advice from Musk ahead of Trump's inauguration. CNBC was unable to reach Musk for comment. "Elon Musk continues to be front and center as a potential bidder for TikTok which likely includes some tech partners/outside investors to get a deal done," Wedbush said in a research note on Wednesday. "Musk would be hand picked by Beijing and his ironclad relationship with Trump would make this a very logical choice in our view," the note added. Nat Schindler, an analyst at Scotiabank, also noted that Musk's acquisition of Twitter has demonstrated his interest in global social media platforms. However, he also sees some potential obstacles for the tech tycoon. "Musk is under fire already for owning X and the perception that he is using it to promote certain political ideas, and any involvement in TikTok could draw additional fire and potentially antitrust scrutiny," Schindler said. Trump has also said he'd "like" to see Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison purchase the platform. Ellison, a longtime Trump supporter, stood beside the President at a press conference on his AI infrastructure investment plans on Tuesday, where Trump was asked questions about a potential TikTok deal. "What I'm thinking about saying to somebody is, buy it, and give half to the United States of America. Half and we'll give you the permit," Trump said before turning to Ellison to ask if the deal sounded reasonable. "Sounds like a good deal to me Mr. President," Ellison replied. Ellison and his company are currently at the center of the TikTok dilemma, operating as a cloud infrastructure provider for ByteDance in the U.S. Given its existing relationship with Tiktok, Oracle and is "directly invested in Tiktok's success in the region," Scotiabank's Schindler said. Ellison had bid for Tiktok, along with Walmart, back in 2020 when Trump first pushed for a ban on the platform. Neither company responded to CNBC's request for comment. Trump had approved of the Walmart-Oracle deal in principle, which would've seen the tech and retail giants partner to take over the video-sharing app in the U.S., avoiding a shutdown. However, the Trump administration's attempt to ban TikTok in the U.S. fell through in the face of legal challenges. Ellison later joined a group of investors that helped Elon Musk buy social media platform Twitter, now known as X, in 2022. "[We believe] Oracle/Ellison could play a pivotal role in any deal given their key technology partnership with TikTok and his appearance at the White House with Project Stargate," Wedbush said. Wedbush added that it expects a slew of TikTok bids to come over the coming weeks from a host of players with Musk and Ellison leading the pack. In addition to Musk and Ellison, experts flagged several other parties likely to be interested in a potential deal for TikTok, adding that the barriers to entry were high. Given the financial stakes of a TikTok deal, it's unlikely that some rogue investor is going to swoop in and buy the platform on the cheap, Paul Triolo of Albright Stone Group told CNBC. "While an up-to-date valuation on TikTok is difficult to come up with, it is likely to the order of $40-80 billion, meaning whoever decides to jump in has to be ready with some serious money," he said. He added that potential suitors are likely to include some of America's largest social media and technology players, such as Meta and Google, in addition to Musk's X. Meta and Google didn't immediately respond to a CNBC inquiry. Sarah Kreps, the director of the Tech Policy Institute at Cornell University, however, warned that players such as Meta, Google and Musk getting a substantial stake in TikTok could raise antitrust questions. Scotiabank analyst Nat Schindler noted that there were also a number of other players, including existing investors BlackRock, Coatue, and General Atlantic, who own a large chunk of TikTok's parent company. According to him, some of these investors are likely to participate in any sale of the U.S. platform by investing in the new entity. "Other large VCs, hedge funds, and asset managers from Tiger to Fidelity would also likely show interest in a fast growing global platform with such a huge viewer base," said Schindler, adding that finding investors to own a part of Tiktok won't be a problem. The fervor surrounding a purchase of TikTok U.S. has also seen some unconventional players enter the fray. Social media superstar MrBeast — real name Jimmy Donaldson — who has more than 100 million TikTok followers has posted several videos in which he indicated serious interest in buying the platform, claiming he has had talks with billionaires. In one video, the internet personality claimed he had an official offer ready, jesting that he might be the new TikTok CEO. Media reports have also mentioned Donaldson and a group of investors preparing to make a bid for TikTok. On Thursday, Matthew Hiltzik, a spokesperson for Donaldson, told CNBC that "Several potential buyers are in ongoing discussions with Jimmy, but he has no exclusive agreements with any of them." Led by Project Liberty Founder Frank McCourt and involving Canadian businessman and TV personality Kevin O'Leary, "The People's Bid for TikTok," has made a $20 billion cash offer to buy TikTok. O'Leary told CNBC last year that he wanted to buy the platform at a discount as any possible deal won't include TikTok's original algorithm. The organization said it already has a replacement for the algorithm to use for TikTok U.S. Following Trump's comments on a 50% stake in the platform, both McCourt and O'Leary told CNBC this week that they were interested in a TikTok deal and were hoping to work with Trump to make it happen. McCourt has also told CNBC that he wants TikTok to run a decentralized social networking protocol, or DSNP, overseen by the Project Liberty Institute, a nonprofit founded by the billionaire. Bidding interest aside, a number of legal and tech experts have told CNBC that Trump's executive order to delay the TikTok ban contradicts the Supreme Court's earlier ruling to uphold the PAFACA and could face legal opposition. O'Leary also told CNBC on Monday that a TikTok deal could not happen under the current law, after the Supreme Court upheld an impending ban on TikTok under the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, or PAFACA, on Sunday. Beijing and its pending negotiations with Trump regarding trade with the U.S. is also expected to play a determining factor in whether the Chinese government would allow ByteDance to make a divestiture. "In this game of high stakes poker between the Trump Administration and Beijing it's clear TikTok is a big chip on the table," Wedush said Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Bank of Japan hikes ratesThe Bank of Japan on Friday hiked rates by 25 basis points to 0.5%, the highest level since 2008. Following the decision, the Japanese yen strengthened to 155.3 against the U.S. dollar as of 1:30 p.m. Singapore time. Earlier Friday, Tokyo released a report that showed core inflation in the country rising to a 16-month high at 3% in December on an annual basis, in line with expectations from a Reuters poll. Record close for S&PThe S&P 500 closed at a fresh high on Thursday as investors liked what they heard from Trump regarding rate cuts. All major U.S. benchmarks are on a four-day winning streak. Positive Wall Street sentiment lifted Asian markets on Friday. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index jumped more than 2%, but Japan's Nikkei 225 edged down after the rate hike. Trump's Davos addressU.S. President Donald Trump addressed the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, virtually on Thursday. In his speech, Trump said he would "demand that interest rates drop immediately," ask Saudi Arabia and OPEC to "bring down the cost of oil," and called the European Union's trade relationship with the U.S. very unfair. Trump said he likes Xi "very much"Trump said Thursday that he likes Chinese President Xi Jinping "very much," according to the White House readout of his virtual interview at Davos. He floated the idea of working with Xi to end the war in Ukraine. Separately, a survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in China released Thursday found that 30% of U.S. companies in China are accelerating their plans to relocate manufacturing or sourcing, the highest proportion since 2022. Crypto order signed by TrumpCryptocurrency advocates got another boost from Trump on Thursday after he signed an executive order to promote the advancement of cryptocurrencies in the U.S. Most of the order focuses on establishing technology and rules around crypto. One of the critical pieces is the creation of a working group to consider a national digital asset stockpile. Boeing projects huge lossBoeing said Thursday that it likely lost about $4 billion in the fourth quarter, or a loss of $5.46 per share. Revenue will probably come in at $15.2 billion, lower than LSEG estimates. Boeing has not posted an annual profit since 2018. The aircraft maker began 2024 with a midair accident and ended it with a crippling labor strike and layoffs. [PRO] Fink goes against pessimism in EuropeThere's severe "pessimism" about the future of Europe at Davos, according to Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock. However, Fink told CNBC on Thursday things might be "near a bottom" — and explains why he's taking that view. Markets are supposed to run on numbers: past performance, projections of profits, return on equity. But words are equally powerful in their capacity to move markets, as Trump's virtual address to the World Economic Forum on Thursday demonstrated. The price of U.S. crude and the global benchmark Brent dropped on Trump saying he'd "ask Saudi Arabia and OPEC to bring down the cost of oil." And after Trump said he would "demand that interest rates drop immediately," the 2-year Treasury yield, which tends to track short-term interest rates, edged lower, while stocks ticked up. In fact, the S&P 500 added 0.53% to close at a record closing high of 6,118.71. Its last all-time closing high was 6,090.27 in early December. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.92% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.22%. It was the fourth consecutive session in the green for all three indexes. But unlike numbers — which are factual (most of the time, anyway) — words can be capricious. "Trump's Davos speech contained some ostensibly positive lines (he called for OPEC to lower oil prices, demanded central banks lower interest rates, and reiterated prior pledges to slash taxes and regulation) but there was very little either incremental or within his control," Adam Crisafulli, founder of Vital Knowledge, said in a note. That doesn't mean Trump won't carry through his declarations. It's unwise, however, to bank on comments ungrounded by concrete action. On the other hand, there are some words that have the heft of policy behind them and should be taken seriously by investors. The U.S. Federal Reserve meets next week. While the chance of a rate cut then is near zero, according to CMEGroup's FedWatch Tool, what Chair Jerome Powell says at his press conference is "likely to cause market volatility," according to James Demmert, chief investment officer at Main Street Research. Learning what to listen to, then, could be as important for investors as deciphering numbers. — CNBC's Alex Harring and Jesse Pound contributed to this report. Got a confidential news tip?

Title: Yuno Energy CEO Cathal Fay: ‘Starting from zero, €600m in revenues is not so bad’
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/01/24/cathal-fay-interview/
Time Published: 2025-01-24T05:45:00Z

Energy supplier Yuno started life in 2010 as “four middle-aged men above a second-hand bookshop in Blackrock”, Co Dublin. “We had an idea, an electricity licence and not much else,” recalls its chief executive and co-founder, Cathal Fay. It was not the most auspicious year to start a business. An economic recession sparked by the collapse of the property market and the banks gripped the country. But the timing turned out to be good for Fay and his colleagues. Their idea was Prepay Power, pay as you go electricity, which allowed people to pay small amounts as they needed, instead of wrestling with big bills. “Ireland was a different place then,” Fay observes. “People responded well to the offer. You pay in small amounts when it suits rather than pay a big bill, and at that stage a big bill every two months was a big ask for consumers. They liked the fact that they could break it down, typically €20, down the shop. We got a great reaction to that.” Prepay went from zero to 2,000 customers by the end of 2011, then 12,000, then 20,000. Even when it ran out of cash to advertise, people kept coming. Its main constraint was getting finance to fund growth. Despite demonstrating that the idea worked, a year of dealing with advisors and meeting “various people around town” failed to get a result. Fay got an introduction through family to Ulric Kenny, then best known as founder of Ion Equity, whom he approached for advice. Instead, Kenny joined as an investor bringing along colleague Andrew Collins. He is the biggest shareholder and company chairman today. “That was a bit of luck,” says Fay. “Not just his investment, but we also got his business insights. He’s been a great chairman of the company.” Yuno is a different place these days. It has swapped the bookshop for an office in Sandyford on the capital’s southside. It has just bought Firmus Energy (Supply) Ltd in Northern Ireland, in a deal thought to be worth around €40 million. That brought in 113,000 homes and businesses, bringing its total customer numbers to more than 400,000. It now employs 600 people, and revenues will soon reach €600 million. In 2023, Yuno’s sales were €373 million while operating profits were €4.3 million. It supplies electricity, gas and home heating oil to customers. Along with Prepay, it has Yuno Energy, a bill-pay supplier. Prepay will continue as a mainstay of the business, but most future growth will come under the “Yuno banner”, Fay predicts. It plans to invest in the bill-pay operation and in recruiting commercial customers. Firmus is already the North’s leading supplier to business and state bodies. We ran out of meters when we were just about to grow. We survived without paying ourselves while we were waiting for investment In the south, Yuno has hired Ian Mulcahy, a 20-year industry veteran, to head up the section offering electricity and gas to businesses. That has been so far so good, according to Fay. “We’re getting on well in terms of meeting our launch targets in commercial customers,” he says, without revealing the numbers. “It’s an interesting contrast. One client brings a lot of gigawatt hours. They’re more dedicated customers, they can choose their own hedging strategies. We advise them and they decide whether they want to go to market or a fixed-rate for the year. So, we’re adjusting to bringing in the expertise, not just a head of department but also key account staff.” Yuno’s business customers can take a pass-through rate, tied to wholesale electricity market prices, which change every half hour, a fixed price for the year, or “any number of products in between”. The company has recruited some big customers, including well-known Irish retailer Smyth’s Toys. On the domestic side, its bill-pay business in the Republic has recruited 35,000 customers since its launch in late 2023. The company maintains that those who buy both electricity and gas save around €900 a year, compared to rivals’ standard rates if they switch, while electricity only customers are €500 better off. Prepay clients pay rates comparable to the standards on offer elsewhere, but benefit from a better service, Fay says. Yuno does not own power plants or gas reservoirs. Instead, it buys its energy on the open market, selling it on at a profit. But it does not buy at the wholesale price on offer at any given time: it agrees deals for electricity and gas months, or even a year or more, in advance of taking delivery, a process known as hedging. This is meant to cut out the risks of constant up and down movement in prices. Fay cites what happened in August 2022 as a good example of how this works. Electricity prices briefly rose to 10 times historic norms, as fear that there would not be enough gas to generate power gripped Europe. Anyone buying then would have had to pay the massively inflated price, but hedging agreements allowed suppliers such as Yuno to avoid this. It had bought a year earlier, when the electricity market was emerging from “the situation where energy prices had been low, so you could buy it at a low price for delivery in 12 months’ time”. However, Fay concedes that those forward prices are tied to what happens at the wholesale level, so homes and businesses still face increases and decreases, but without the dramatic peaks and troughs seen on the wholesale market. “Absolutely, yeah. You can’t beat the market,” he says. “What you’re doing is trying to remove volatility.” Essentially, success in the business hinges on getting the hedging strategy right. Yuno has 30 people working in its trading department, equating to 5 per cent of its employees. Its bill-pay business was launched as the pressure on prices eased in late 2023, allowing it to offer lower rates than rivals committed to hedging contracts struck at higher levels. Electricity prices are tied to gas, as this is the fuel used to generate most of the power used in Europe. They have been falling, but now there is a risk that they will head in the other direction. Russia recently shut a pipeline through Ukraine that provided around 5 per cent of Europe’s natural gas needs. This was expected, but it came during a cold snap when demand was already high, so price has been moving up steadily. We had an idea, an electricity licence and not much else “Well, gas went up 25 per cent in December,” Fay says. “This winter has been colder and calmer than last winter, so that means more demand for gas for heating, and calmer means more demand for gas for power generation. The market has been tight and nervous, so prices have gone up – really driven by the fact that in the colder, calmer conditions, gas storage is 15 per cent less than this time last year and less than the five-year average.” Europe competes with south-east Asia for gas supplies. In the medium term, volatility looks likely to continue, particularly as the continent will have to spend the summer replenishing its reduced gas stores, so pressure will remain on prices even as demand from homes and businesses subsides. While no one is likely to increase charges now, Fay maintains that all suppliers, his own company included, are watching this closely. Fay’s background as a qualified engineer clearly helps him grasp the various moving parts of the business he runs. After getting his primary degree from University College Dublin, he did a Master’s in computer applications in Trinity, and then went to work with Telecom Eireann, now Eircom. He left in 2000, moving to a company that produced ebooks and productivity software for personal organisers. “I found there that it was all about first-mover advantage, getting things to market quickly. We were first mover, but we found that there wasn’t a market,” he says. Then he worked with Red Circle, which developed ringtones and games for pre-smart phone mobiles. Strangely, this business was all about print advertising. “We’d take out a page in a magazine in the UK,” he says. “We’d know exactly how to optimise each centimetre of that space to maximise the number of ringtones that people bought. That gave us a significant advantage, so we grew big in the UK.” Red Circle was then sold to Irish company Zamano. Fay remained on until 2010, at which point the iPhone had taken over, so ringtones and games were all app-based. Around that time, he ran into a former colleague who was involved in pre-paid energy, prompting him to realise it could work here. Shortly afterwards, he made the move to the second-hand bookshop. Yuno is about to expand in yet another direction, district heating. This comes in two forms. One is a self-contained system where an apartment building is served by a single common boiler, which tenants draw on as needed, through heat exchangers in their homes. Yuno is already involved in such projects. The other is known as “networked” district heating, which draws heat from a single source to a group of buildings in the one area. In the Irish case, this would be industries such as data centres and pharmaceutical manufacturers, which generate quantities of wasted heat. District heating is common in Nordic countries so the systems for tapping it are tried and tested. Applying it here means that everybody wins, says Fay. It means a cheap source of heat for consumers, turning waste into revenue for the industries involved, which must pay for cooling, and cutting carbon emissions, as both the homes and the manufacturers are drawing on the same energy. You can’t beat the market. What you’re doing is trying to remove volatility The State’s climate action plan includes a commitment to this technology, but it needs infrastructure, ie, pipes connecting the data centres and pharma makers with apartment blocks and homes. Theoretically, that should not be difficult, as many of the industries are close enough to residential areas. An existing pilot scheme connects an Amazon facility with homes in Tallaght in west Dublin. “We’ve looked at a number of case studies,” says Fay. “Even in my own local area in Dun Laoghaire, there is a pharmaceutical company that generates heat, and there are umpteen number of apartment buildings that will take it.” The Government and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland have identified suitable sites themselves. Yuno has already hired someone with experience of this in Denmark to run this division. The next steps involve the Oireachtas passing laws enabling it, and for local councils to go from there and lay the pipes. Fay says there are indications that this is going to happen. “It cries out to be done, because we have so many data centres around Dublin that being able to take the waste heat from them is a useful way of supporting them in meeting their own climate change mitigation goals. But you can see that it’s likely to be on a longer timeframe than what we’re used to,” he says. The slower pace does not seem to bother Fay unduly. He’s had “plenty of scares” on the way to this point, he says. “We ran out of meters when we were just about to grow, while people were still calling us, despite us not advertising. We survived without paying ourselves while we were waiting for investment. So €600 million in revenues is not so bad from starting from zero.” Name: Cathal Fay Post: Chief executive, Yuno Energy Career: Began working life as an engineer with a master in computer applications, worked for Telecom Eireann – now Eircom – before moving to a firm that developed software for personal organisers and then to Red Circle, which provided ringtones and games for pre-smart mobile phones.

Guess who’s back and buying more Bitcoin? It’s Blackrock taking a bolder approach to the world’s top digital asset. According to Arkham Intelligence’s recent tracking, BlackRock reportedly bought $600 million worth of Bitcoin on January 22nd, the most significant buy this year. Arkham added that this latest acquisition pushed the company’s holdings to 569,343 Bitcoins, currently valued at $58.32 billion. In addition to Bitcoin, BlackRock holds other digital assets, including 74.5 million USDC tokens, $3.7 billion worth of Ether, and coins like UBXS, Colle AI, MOG, TUA, and SPX6900. This year, BlackRock’s aggressive acquisition of Bitcoin got off to a scorching start. Lookonchain revealed on Twitter/X that among all funds, BlackRock’s iShares receive the most Bitcoin inflows. Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust comes in next, with a total of 208 Bitcoins, then followed by the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which acquired 165 Bitcoins on the same day. Jan 22 Update: 10 #Bitcoin ETFs NetFlow: +6,719 $BTC(+$700.94M)🟢#BlackRock(iShares) inflows 6,208 $BTC($647.67M) and currently holds 569,343 $BTC($59.4B). 9 #Ethereum ETFs NetFlow: +18,108 $ETH(+$59.59M)🟢#BlackRock(iShares) inflows 16,959 $ETH($55.81M) and currently holds… pic.twitter.com/I2EAn9iABF — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) January 22, 2025 Looking at the seven-day net inflow, BlackRock remains the top player in the industry. Over this period, BlackRock’s iShares fund acquired 15,351 Bitcoin, double the numbers submitted by Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust. Akr21 Shares was also a top performer in the last seven days, adding almost 4,000 Bitcoins to its holdings. BlackRock’s holdings also include other digital assets, including ETH. In the same data shared by LookonChain, BlackRock added around 58 ETH but lags behind the acquisition of VanEck, with its 732 ETH tokens purchased in the last seven days. Although BlackRock adds a substantial number of ETH tokens, its investments in Bitcoin matter to the industry. The company’s Bitcoin purchases are often a measure of the market’s performance. Since launching the spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, BlackRock has consistently led the segment with aggressive purchases. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink on Bitcoin: “If everyone adopted a 2% or 5% allocation, you could see Bitcoin at $700,000” Incredible how far Bitcoin has come. 🟠 pic.twitter.com/psxP3aq4WI — Geiger Capital (@Geiger_Capital) January 22, 2025 Bitcoin is currently trading at $104,000, a little lower than its closing price yesterday. Analysts are nonetheless optimistic about Bitcoin’s price trajectory based on its recent success. Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, has shown confidence about the potential price of Bitcoin. Fink told the World Economic Forum that Bitcoin was becoming more and more popular with asset management companies and international investment funds. According to Fink, these companies desire BlackRock’s opinion on Bitcoin. If everyone owns Bitcoin and contributes 2% to 5%, the industry will reach $700k, Fink continued. In addition, Fink stressed that they are not endorsing Bitcoin, but rather highlighting its potential. Bitcoin could see some improvement under Trump, according to Samara Cohen, another BlackRock official. According to Cohen, Bitcoin is doing well in the market under Trump. Once regulations are clear, Cohen anticipates a banner year for Bitcoin. Featured image from Reuters, chart from TradingView For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Bitcoin’s Breakout At Davos: Global Elites Reckon With Crypto Revolution
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidbirnbaum/2025/01/23/bitcoins-breakout-at-davos-global-elites-reckon-with-crypto-revolution/
Time Published: 2025-01-24T04:25:26Z
Full Content:
In a bold statement at the World Economic Forum in Davos, President Donald Trump declared that the United States would soon become the "world capital of artificial intelligence and crypto," thanks to an imminent surge in American energy production. This proclamation marks a significant departure from the previous administration's heavy-handed regulations, which stifled both innovation and growth in the energy, bitcoin, and AI sectors. Trump’s statement, once unthinkable at Davos, was met with a notable shift in tone. In years past, discussions about bitcoin and pro-energy policies would have been dismissed in favor of elitist agendas centered around ESG mandates, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), and expanding global surveillance efforts. But this year, the tone was different. Wall Street's biggest players are no longer laughing at bitcoin—instead, they’re making bold predictions. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink speculated that bitcoin could soar to $700,000, while Coinbase’s Brian Armstrong pitched the idea of a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve to the governor of the central bank of South Africa. As the saying goes, “First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, and then you win.” The question now is, which stage are we in? President Trump fulfilled a major campaign promise this week by pardoning Ross Ulbricht, the Silk Road founder who had been serving a life sentence without parole. Ulbricht’s case became a symbol of government overreach, with many in the bitcoin and libertarian communities rallying behind the call for his release. Trump framed the decision as a victory for liberty and personal sovereignty, key principles that align with the ethos of bitcoin itself. Following the announcement, bitcoin’s price responded positively, underscoring the growing recognition of Ulbricht as a martyr of the digital age. His story serves as a stark reminder of the fight for financial freedom and the perils of government overreach in a rapidly digitizing world. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s ongoing convulsions amid its identity crisis showed themselves again this week with the announcement of Etherealize, a new entity focused on institutional adoption. Though initial rumors suggested it was a second Ethereum Foundation, it was later revealed to be an Ethereum Foundation-backed initiative aimed at integrating Ethereum into traditional finance. Etherealize’s mission is to market Ethereum’s scaling solutions and staking yields to institutions, an effort to maintain relevance in the face of a severe, long-term decline in the exchange rate between BTC and ETH. However, Ethereum’s continued centralization and lack of fixed monetary policy leave it vulnerable to insider-driven strategies that stand in stark contrast to bitcoin’s Nakamoto Consensus. Bitcoin infrastructure company Blockstream has taken another step toward bridging traditional finance and bitcoin with the launch of its asset management division, unveiling two institutional-grade funds—the Blockstream Income Fund and the Blockstream Alpha Fund. These funds offer regulated access to bitcoin investments with a focus on collateralized lending and active management strategies. The move underscores bitcoin’s maturity as a financial asset and its growing role in institutional portfolios. As institutions seek exposure to bitcoin, products like these provide a bridge between traditional finance and the bitcoin ecosystem, leveraging its unique attributes without compromising its core principles. The speculative excesses of the crypto space were on full display this week with the launch of $TRUMP, a meme coin that briefly reached a staggering $14.5 billion market cap before crashing. With 80% of its supply concentrated in the hands of insiders, the rise and fall of $TRUMP served as a cautionary tale about the speculative frenzy that often grips altcoin markets. Although meme coins may be fun for some who enjoy gambling, they lack the fundamentals and staying power that constitute an asset worthy of investment. All of this activity comes at the same time as extremely bullish predictions from industry leaders. Some analysts suggest that bitcoin trading above $100,000 is akin to a coiled spring, poised for a significant upward breakout. As mentioned above, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink predicted that bitcoin could reach $700,000. Not to be outdone, David Bailey, CEO of BTC Inc. and key contributor to the Trump administration’s bitcoin strategy, targets a price of $1 million per coin within four years. The events at the Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, along with the unveiling of the Trump administration’s bitcoin policy, mark the beginning of a new era. The once-dismissed digital asset is now becoming recognized as a legitimate and vital component of the financial system. With geopolitical tensions, inflationary pressures, and economic uncertainty on the rise, bitcoin’s value proposition has never been clearer. Whether it’s being used as a hedge against currency debasement, an investment vehicle for institutions, or a strategic reserve for sovereign states, bitcoin’s role is expanding at an unprecedented pace. The question is no longer if bitcoin will be widely adopted, but how quickly the transition will take place. As 2025 unfolds, one thing is certain: bitcoin’s march toward mainstream acceptance is well underway, and those paying attention stand to benefit the most. One Community. Many Voices.

This Co Dublin bungalow, which has stayed in the family since it was built in the 1940s, offers easy access to the sea and village, and its own fruit trees Ann Connolly Redmond and her daughter Rachael Fisher in the kitchen of the family's Blackrock home Pic. Bryan Meade Number 1 St Vincent's Park, Blackrock The living room One of the four bedrooms The kitchen The hallway 1 St Vincent’s Park, Blackrock, Co Dublin Asking price: €695,000 Agent: DNG (01) 283 2900 ​If Ann Connolly could bottle the homely authenticity of No 1 St Vincent’s Park in Blackrock, she could sell it by the bucketload with the business she works for, a lifestyle store where goods are taken home in repurposed cement bags and where the ethos is all about “the connections between makers and customers”. Connolly works for Amanda Pratt, who was part-owner owner and chief buyer of lifestyle brand Avoca before it was bought by global food service and facilities company Aramark. Pratt recently opened Amo & Pax, a lifestyle outlet in Kilmacanogue, Co Wicklow, which sells furnishings and accessories that wouldn’t look out of place in Connolly’s family home. It all seems “full circle-ish”. Connolly’s uncle Brendan built a business around local shops: Doyle’s hardware and toy shops – of which there were six, including one in Dun Laoghaire and another in Parnell Street in the city centre. Another uncle, Paddy, had a supermarket in Gelnageary and greengrocers in Dalkey and Sandymount. But, of course, you can’t buy family history. The apple trees and rhubarb crowns planted in the back garden of No 1 by Conolly’s grandmother remain productive to this day. The collective energy and memories of four generations of her family infuse the atmosphere of the post-WWII bungalow near Blackrock village. Here, light-touch improvements carried out over generations have given it the sort of burlap-and-treasure-box character lifestyle store owners dream of. The living room Connolly now lives in Bray and travels constantly to trade shows as part of her job with Pratt, with whom she has worked since the Avoca days. Meanwhile, she has also been tasked with the job of divesting the property that has been home to her family for four generations. It isn’t an easy one. “It is so heartbreaking,” she says. “It has so many stories. “Unfortunately, my mother passed away last February. She was 93 years of age, but she had been in a nursing home for the last four years with dementia. My dad died in 2017, when he was 84. My lovely daughter, Rachel Fisher, has lovingly minded No 1 for the past few years and has looked after the apple trees and all the loganberries, whilst sea-swimming almost every day down in Seapoint, which is a really short cycle away.” Connolly’s family saga on this patch of ground goes right back to chapter one. The home her grandparents moved into in the late 1940s was built by The Daughters of Charity, whose convent, Dunardagh, possessed large tracts of land in this area of south Co Dublin, where the nuns had been heavily involved with health care and social services since the mid-1800s. One of the four bedrooms In the middle of the 20th century, the perennial Irish problem of a shortage of family homes was as familiar an issue then as it is now. “There were six families living up in Dunardagh,” Connolly says. “And I don’t really know why but my granny and granddad, Ellen and Joseph Doyle, were one of those families and basically the nuns commissioned 40 houses to be built at St Vincent’s Park, of which my grandparents had first dibs. “They picked No 1, because my granny originated from Co Offaly and she wanted a patch that she could plant apples and have a few chickens. The big apple tree in the back garden has to be 70 years old. Her loganberries are still there too. She was a great gardener and loved to cook. Everyone always ate well in this house.” The kitchen The Doyles went on to raise two girls and five boys in what was then a three-bedroom house. They extended the house over time, adding a kitchen at first, then an indoor bathroom – the first house in the estate to have one – and later a granny flat. For her part, Connolly was born and spent her very early life in England, where her parents Peggy and Gerry had moved. She was five when they came on holiday to Ireland and ended up staying after Ellen, her grandmother, became unwell. “So then we just grew up in Blackrock, and it was fantastic,” she says. “We would saunter down to the sea and be jumping off diving boards, strolling back, going into the sweet shops. “My brother and I would be sent to get the messages on a Saturday morning, and we would have our list – go to the butchers, and the fish shops and so on. Our neighbours in No 2, the O’Briens, owned the local fruit and veg shop.” The now 1,130sq ft semi-detached bungalow is on a corner plot in a cul-de-sac off Temple Road. It currently has four bedrooms, an entrance porch, a living room, a kitchen/dining room, a bathroom and a guest toilet. The fourth bedroom – originally the granny flat – is now connected to the main building. Number 1 St Vincent's Park, Blackrock There is a side entrance to the back garden and a well-tended front garden populated with rose bushes and other shrubs. While you cannot park directly outside the house, there is on-street parking and a small green, where older children might like to play. The house currently has oil-fired heating and a building energy rating of F, which the next owners may want to improve on. The interior is tastefully decorated in neutral colours, set off by selected furniture and accessories. The living room has polished timber floors and a fireplace with a wood-effect stove. The kitchen/ diner is bright and overlooks the back garden and granny’s apple tree. It has a chequerboard floor and green storage presses. For wannabee Blackrock residents, getting in there is difficult and expensive these days. Out of roughly 50 listings currently on myhome.ie, for example, only 20 are valued at under €800,000. Three-bed terraced townhouses are currently asking in the region of €550,000 whilst some semis are asking upwards of €775,000. Number 1 St Vincent’s Park has an asking price of €695,000 with DNG.
