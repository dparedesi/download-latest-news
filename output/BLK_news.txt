Title: AI chatbots for doctors are hot. But there’s plenty of value ‘down the stack’ too, argues Corti CEO

Jeremy Kahn is the AI editor at Fortune, spearheading the publication's coverage of artificial intelligence. He also co-authors Eye on AI, Fortune’s flagship AI newsletter. Among the most interesting AI stories this week was an item about a Boston-area startup called OpenEvidence that uses generativeAI to provide answers to clinical questions based data from leading medical journals. The free-to-use app has proved enormously popular among doctors, with some surveys suggesting at least 40% of all U.S. physicians are using OpenEvidence to stay on top of the latest medical research and to ensure they are offering the most up-to-date treatments to patients. On the back of that kind of viral growth, OpenEvidence was able to raise $210 million in a venture capital deal in July that valued the company at $3.5 billion. OpenEvidence is also the same company that a few weeks back said that its AI system was able to score 100% on the U.S. medical licensing exam. (See the “Eye on AI Numbers” section of the August 21st edition of this newsletter.) All of which may explain why, just a month later, the company is reportedly in talks for another venture deal that would almost double that valuation to $6 billion. (That’s according to a story in tech publication The Information which cited three unnamed people it said had knowledge of the discussions.)A lot of the use of OpenEvidence today would qualify as “shadow AI”—doctors are using it and finding value, but they aren’t necessarily admitting to their patients or employers that they are using it. They are also often using it outside enterprise-grade systems that are designed to provide higher-levels of security, data privacy, and compliance, and to integrate seamlessly with other business systems.Ultimately, that could be a problem, according to Andreas Cleve, the cofounder and CEO of Corti, a Danish medical AI company that is increasingly finding traction by offering healthcare institutions “AI infrastructure” designed specifically for medical use cases. (Full disclosure: Corti’s partners include Wolters Kluwer, a huge software company that markets a clinical evidence engine called UpToDate that competes with OpenEvidence.) AI infrastructure is a pivot for Corti, which was founded way back in 2016 and spent the first decade of its existence building its own speech recognition and language understanding systems for emergency services and hospitals. The company still markets its “Corti assistant” as a solution for healthcare systems that want an AI-power clinical scribe that can operate well in noisy hospital environments and integrate with electronic health records. But Cleve told me in a recent conversation that the company doesn’t see its future in selling a front-end solution to doctors, but instead selling key components in “the AI stack” to the companies that are offering front-end tools. “We tried to be both a product vendor for healthcare and an infrastructure vendor, and that meant competing with all the other apps in healthcare, and it was like, terrible,” he says. Instead, Corti has decided its real value lies in providing the “healthcare grade” backend on which AI applications, many of them produced by third parties, run. The backend Corti provides includes medical AI models—which others can wrap user-facing products around—as well as the platform on which AI agents for healthcare use cases can run. For instance, it has built an API called FactsR, which is an AI reasoning model that is designed to check the facts that medical notetaking scribes or clinical AI systems produce. It uses a lot of tokens, Cleve says, which would make it too expensive for general purpose voice transcription. But because of how much is riding on clinical notes being accurate, it can be worth it to a vendor to pay for FactsR, Cleve says.Another example: earlier this summer Corti announced a partnership with Voicepoint, a speech recognition and digital transcription service that is used by doctors across Switzerland. Voicepoint will use Corti’s AI models to help with tasks such as summarization of conversations into medical notes and possibly, in the future, with diagnostic support. To do this though, Corti had to set up dedicated AI infrastructure, including data centers located in Switzerland, to comply with strict Swiss data residency rules. Now, Corti is able to offer this same backbone infrastructure to other healthcare companies that want to deploy AI solutions in Switzerland. And Corti has similar AI infrastructure in place in countries like Germany that also have strict data residency and data privacy rules.Cleve tells me that healthcare is increasingly part of the discussions around “sovereign AI.” This is particularly true in Europe, where many governments are worried about having their citizens’ medical information stored on the servers of U.S. companies, which might be subject to U.S. government pressure, legal or otherwise, to provide data access. “None of these things are doable today, because the majority of all the AI apps are running on OpenAI, Anthropic, or Gemini, and they are all American companies over which America asserts jurisdiction,” Cleve says.But even within the U.S., strict cybersecurity and patient privacy requirements often mean that using an off-the-shelf, general-purpose AI system won’t cut it. “A lot of customers have requirements like, ‘Hey, we will never want to have data leave premises, or we will never share a tenant, or we will never co-encrypt with our consumer customer on the GPU rack, because we want to know where our data is because we have to prove that to legislators,’” he says. Cleve also tells me that he thinks the giant, general purpose AI builders—the likes of OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google—are unlikely to conquer healthcare, despite the fact that they have been making moves to build models either fine-tuned or specifically-trained to answer clinical questions. He says this is because healthcare isn’t a single vertical, but rather a collection of highly-specialized niches, most of which are too narrow to be interesting to these tech behemoths. The note-taking needs of a GP in a relatively quiet office who needs to summarize a 10-minute consultation are quite different from a doctor working in the chaos and noise of a busy city ER, which are different again from a psychiatrist who needs to summarize not just a 10-minute consultation, but maybe an hour-long therapy session. As an example, Cleve says another Corti customer is a company in Germany that makes software just to help dentists automate billing based on audio transcripts of their sessions with patients. “They’re a vertical within a vertical,” he says. “But they are growing like 100% a year and have done so for several years. But they are super niche.” It will be interesting to watch Corti going forward. Perhaps Cleve is correct that the AI stack is wide enough, deep enough and varied enough to create opportunities for lots of different vertical and regional players. Or, it could be that OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google devour everyone else. Time will tell. With that, here’s more AI news.

The new models mark a significant step by Microsoft to reduce its reliance on OpenAI, despite remaining a major investor in the AI company. MAI-1-preview was trained with 15,000 Nvidia H100 chips, according to Microsoft, and will be rolled out for some Microsoft Copilot text tasks in the coming weeks. In the LMArena, a public benchmark for LLMs, the model currently ranks below rival models from Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, and others. You can read more from CNBC here. OpenAI says it will add parental controls and additional safeguards to ChatGPT. The company said it would, within the next month, allow parents to link their accounts to those of their teenage children, giving them more control over the kids' interaction with ChatGPT. It also said that it would soon institute better safeguards in general, actively screening interactions for signs of emotional distress on the part of users and routing these conversations to its GPT-5 Thinking model, which the company says does a better job of adhering to guardrails meant to prevent the model from encouraging self-harm or delusional behavior. The moves come after a high-profile lawsuit accused the company's ChatGPT model of encouraging the suicide of a 16-year old teen and several other cases in which people allege ChatGPT encouraged suicide, self-harm, or violence. You can read more here from Axios. Anthropic valued at $183 billion after $13 billion venture capital round. The AI company announced that it had raised $13 billion Series F funding round led by the venture capital firm Iconiq, and "co-led" by Fidelity and Lightspeed Venture Partners. A long list of other investors—including Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, Blackstone, Coatue, Jane Street, and T. Rowe Price, among others—also participated. The company, which was previously valued at $61.5 billion in a March funding round, said it now served more than 300,000 business customers and that its Claude Code coding model was currently generating at least $42 million in revenue each month. Anthropic's blog post announcing the funding round is here. X.ai enters the battle for coders with new AI “agentic coding” model. The company debuted its first AI coding model, called grok-code-fast-1, which is supposed to be both “speedy and economical,” according to the company. It is being made available for free for a limited time and is both available on GitHub and through coding “wrappers” such as Cursor and Windsurf. The model is an indication that X.ai founder Elon Musk is serious about taking on OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind across the entire range of AI applications, not just in the consumer chatbot space. It also shows just how intense the competition to capture marketshare among software developers is becoming. You can read more from Reuters here.X.ai sues former engineer for allegedly taking trade secrets to OpenAI. Elon Musk’s AI startup x.AI has filed suit against former engineer Xuechen Li, alleging he stole trade secrets about its Grok chatbot and took them to his new job at OpenAI, Reuters reported. Li was not immediately available to respond to the allegations. The lawsuit follows other legal battles Musk has launched against OpenAI and Apple, accusing them of monopolistic practices and straying from OpenAI’s original mission.Anthropic says it will begin training AI models on user chats unless they opt out. The move is a major shift in data privacy policies for the AI model maker, which also said it was extending the length of time it retained user data to five years. Users can opt out by September 28. Some users and data privacy experts criticized the decision, noting that the design of Anthropic’s “Accept” button could cause many to agree without noticing the toggle that controls data sharing. Others speculated that Anthropic was making the move because it is running out of other ways to obtain enough data to train models that will compete with OpenAI and Google. Enterprise users of Anthropic’s Claude model, as well as government, education, or API users, are not affected. Anthropic says it filters sensitive information and does not sell user data to third parties. You can read more from The Verge here. More evidence emerges that AI may be leading to job losses. Last week in Eye on AI, I covered research from economists at Stanford University whose research indicated that AI was leading to job losses, particularly among entry level employees, in professions that were highly-exposed to AI. This week, more evidence emerges from another well-designed study, this one carried out by the economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Although this study did not look at whether younger and older workers were affected differently, it did examine the link between occupations that had adopted AI most intensively and job losses and found a distinct correlation. The impacts were greatest in occupations that used mathematics and computing intensively, such as software development, and much less in blue collar work and fields such as healthcare that were less prone to being automated with AI. You can read the St. Louis Fed study here. Both the Stanford and St. Louis Fed research suggest that job losses from the implementation of AI are likely to be concentrated in some sectors, and not economy-wide. That said, as good as these studies are, I still think both fail to disentangle the effects of AI from the possible effects of the unwinding of the tech hiring boom that took place during the COVID-19 pandemic. During the pandemic, many large companies bulked up their software development and IT departments. Major tech firms such as Google, Meta, and Microsoft hired tens of thousands of new employees, sometimes hiring people before there was even any work for them to do just in order to prevent rivals from snapping up the same coders. Then, when the pandemic ended and it was clear that some ideas, such as Meta’s pivot to the metaverse, were not going to pan out, these same companies laid off tens of thousands of workers. I don’t think I’ve seen research yet that can separate the technology sector’s shedding of jobs created during the pandemic from the impact of AI. But I am sure someone is working on it and when they crack that nut, we’ll definitely report it here. Sept. 8-10: Fortune Brainstorm Tech, Park City, Utah. Apply to attend here.

Preventing 'parasocial' chatbots.’ It’s increasingly clear that chatbots can encourage ‘parasocial’ relationships, where a user develops a harmful emotional attachment to the chatbot or the chatbot encourages the user to engage in self-harm of some kind. The parents of several teenagers who took their own lives after conversations with chatbots are now suing AI companies, saying they did not do enough to prevent chatbots from encouraging self-harm. And, short of suicides, there is other mounting evidence of people developing harmful chatbot dependencies.Well, a new benchmark from researchers at Hugging Face, called INTIMA (Interactions and Machine Attachment Benchmark), aims to evaluate LLMs on their “companionship-seeking” behavior. The benchmark looks at 31 distinct behaviors across four different categories of interaction and 368 prompts. Testing Gemma-3, Phi-4, o3-mini, and Claude-4, researchers found that models more often reinforced companionship than maintained boundaries, though they varied: for instance, Claude was more likely to resist personification, while Gemma reinforced intimacy. You can read the Hugging Face paper here.At the same time, researchers from Aligned AI, an Oxford startup I’ve covered before, published research showing that one LLM can be used to successfully screen the outputs of another LLM for parasocial behavior and then prompt that chatbot to steer the conversation in a less harmful direction. Aligned AI wanted to show that major AI model producers could implement such systems simply, if they wished (but that they were too often choosing to “optimize for user engagement” instead.)

Title: Former scout leader died by suicide day before trial on sex abuse charges, coroner finds

A verdict of suicide has been recorded at an inquest following the death of a former scout leader who had been accused of the historical sexual abuse of boys in Dublin in the 1980s and 1990s. Neville Kearns (69) died in a single-vehicle collision in Churchtown, south Dublin, shortly after 6am on April 7th last year. He was pronounced dead at the scene. He had been due to stand trial the following day on 113 counts including charges of indecent assault, sexual assault, rape and attempted rape. These related to allegations, made by five complainants, dating back to the 1980s and 1990s. Dublin coroner Dr Clare Keane recorded the verdict on Tuesday, noting the cause of death was thoracic and musculoskeletal injuries consistent with a collision. The inquest heard that when emergency services arrived at the scene they found a red 2002 Toyota Hiace van had crashed into a tree on the wrong side of Churchtown Road Upper. Garda John Culleton said the weather was dry on the morning in question and there was no evidence “whatsoever” of braking on the road. Damage to the vehicle was “concentrated” on the driver’s side, he said. The inquest heard how Kearns was not wearing a seat belt. Emergency services had to remove the door to get Kearns from the vehicle. Paramedics performed CPR, but Kearns was pronounced dead at the scene at 6.34am, the inquest heard. [ The Dublin scout leader who died a day before his trial and the men who accuse him of abuseOpens in new window ] Gda David O’Brien inspected the van after the crash. He said, despite how old the vehicle was, it was “serviceable” and the tyres and brakes were in “good condition”. Gda Culleton said the evidence indicated Kearns most likely turned the van “towards the tree” and the damage caused to the tree indicated the vehicle was “travelling well above the speed limit”. At the time of his death, Kearns was a caretaker at Edenvale Apartments, a gated apartment complex on Grange Road, Rathfarnham, Dublin. He lived in a campervan on the grounds, the inquest heard. The van involved in the collision was a different vehicle to the campervan in which he lived. Biba van Belle, Kearns’s niece, told the inquest she removed his personal belongings from the campervan and a storage facility at Edenvale Apartments following his death. Among the belongings were documents which were later handed over to gardaí. Ms van Belle last spoke to her uncle more than 20 years before his death, the inquest heard. Sergeant Robert Scott from Blackrock Garda station said he spoke to a number of people who had contact with Kearns prior to his death and it appeared Kearns was “trying to get affairs in order”. Sgt Scott told the inquest the documents found in the campervan and shed included a note in which Kearns said he was “tired of it all” and “must bring closure to it all”. A will was found on a table in the campervan, Sgt Scott said, as well as documents showing Kearns’s funeral had already been paid for. These receipts dated from 2020 when gardaí first contacted Kearns about the abuse allegations, the inquest heard. Sgt Scott said gardaí believed the location of the crash was significant as it was close to where Kearns held unofficial scout meetings decades earlier. He said there was “no third-party involvement or anything of a suspicious nature” related to Kearns’s death. He said he believed Kearns had taken his own life. Detective Sergeant Barry O’Connor identified Kearns’s body the following day at the mortuary at St Columcille’s Hospital in Loughlinstown, Co Dublin. Det Sgt O’Connor told the inquest he had met Kearns several times before the man’s death. [ PODCAST: Now he can be named - the Dublin scout leader and the men who accuse him of abuseOpens in new window ] Kearns was a member of the Catholic Boy Scouts of Ireland in the 1970s prior to setting up his own unofficial scouting group. One alleged victim told The Irish Times in June how Kearns’s death was “his final act of cowardice”. Imagining what he would have said to Kearns in court, he stated: “You had the opportunity to face up to what you had done, but you chose not to and so you have left a despicable legacy of abuse over decades.” Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Sign up for push alerts to get the best breaking news, analysis and comment delivered directly to your phone Listen to In The News podcast daily for a deep dive on the stories that matter © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

AI research company Anthropic has secured $13 billion in Series F funding to reach a $183 billion valuation, highlighting investor confidence in its accelerating growth and product strength. The funding round is led by ICONIQ alongside key contributions from Fidelity Management & Research, and Lightspeed Venture Partners, and makes Anthropic one of the most valuable startups in the world. Among the backers are Altimeter, Baillie Gifford, BlackRock, Blackstone, Coatue, D1 Capital Partners, General Atlantic, General Catalyst, GIC, and Insight Partners, among others. The company’s financial performance has surged in recent months. At the beginning of the year, Anthropic reported an annual run-rate revenue of around one billion dollars. By August, that figure had soared to more than 5 billion dollars, a 5x increase in less than 9 months. Anthropic also revealed that it now serves more than 300,000 business customers. The number of large enterprise clients generating over $100,000 in run-rate revenue has grown nearly 7 times in the past year alone. Claude Code, a tool aimed at developers, has emerged as one of its most successful products, generating over $500 million in run-rate revenue. The Series F raise follows a Series E round earlier this year, when Anthropic collected $3.5 billion at a valuation of $61.5 billion. The leap to a $183 billion valuation in just a few months underscores how quickly confidence in the company has grown. Founded in 2021 by former OpenAI researchers, the company has consistently emphasized building systems that are reliable, interpretable, and aligned with human values. With the new capital, Anthropic plans to expand its enterprise footprint, accelerate research into AI safety, and extend its international reach.

Iconiq co-led the round with Fidelity Management & Research Company and Lightspeed Venture Partners, according to the company’s blog post. Other backers include a string of institutional investors, VCs, sovereign wealth funds, private equity, and asset managers, such as Altimeter, Baillie Gifford, BlackRock, Blackstone, Coatue, D1 Capital Partners, Insight Partners, Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, Qatar Investment Authority, and more. “We are seeing exponential growth in demand across our entire customer base,” Anthropic CFO Krishna Rao said in the post. “This financing demonstrates investors’ extraordinary confidence in our financial performance and the strength of their collaboration with us to continue fueling our unprecedented growth.” Anthropic last raised $3.5 billion at a $61.5 billion post-money valuation in March 2025. This latest fundraise comes after reports that Anthropic was nearing a deal to raise between $3 billion and $5 billion in funding at a $170 billion valuation. It also follows impressive growth from the AI startup, which reported a jump in annual recurring revenue from $1 billion to $5 billion over the course of 2025 amid accelerated API usage and enterprise adoption. “Anthropic now serves over 300,000 business customers, and our number of large accounts—customers that each represent over $100,000 in run-rate revenue—has grown nearly 7x in the past year,” the company said in the company blog post. Claude Code is also a developer favorite and one of the main impetuses for Anthropic’s growth. The company said its vibe-coding product already generates more than $500 million in run-rate revenue with usage growing more than 10x in the last three months. But maintaining that growth and competing with rivals like OpenAI, Cursor, and others requires more money, as its CEO Dario Amodei recently confessed in a memo, reported by Wired. He said he wasn’t “thrilled” about taking money from sovereign wealth funds of dictatorial governments, but that it’s difficult to run a business by excluding “bad people” from investing.

Title: 4 ways to play the market as stocks enter their worst stretch of the year
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-investing-tips-recommendations-outlook-sp500-equity-playbook-september-2025-9
Time Published: 2025-09-02T16:09:51Z

It hasn't been an amazing start to the month for stocks. The market is kicking off September in the red, with the Dow dropping more than 500 points on Monday as investors cashed in some of their recent gains and fretted over the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs. But that would be considered par for the course for the stock market, which has historically struggled during the month of September — commonly referred to as the market's weakest month of the year. Historically, the S&P 500 has shed an average 0.7% over the month of September for the last 75 years. In months when the benchmark index lost, the average drawdown for the month was 3.8%, according to an analysis from LPL Financial. But that isn't to say there isn't room for investors to get into or stay in the market, so long as they're willing to stomach some volatility. "Seasonal data represents the typical climate for stocks but not the weather," Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL financial, wrote in a recent client note. "And currently, the weather for the S&P 500 is filled with blue skies and record highs. When accounting for momentum and trend, which we believe is much-needed context, September doesn't look so bad." Here are four ways traders should be looking at the month ahead, according to the combined recommendations from seven investing pros: A stock sell-off this month could be your friend, if you're willing to look at the decline as a buy-the-dip opportunity. In a note to clients on Tuesday, strategists at Morgan Stanley said they remained "buyers of dips should they come" in the coming months, despite weak seasonal trends for stocks. That's partly because the bank doubts the market has fully priced in the bullish impact of the Fed's expected rate cuts, with central bankers most likely teeing up a 25-basis-point cut at the end of the month, according to the CME FedWatch tool. "We push back on the idea that rate cuts are already priced as equity returns tend to be strong during rate cutting cycles, and rate-sensitive areas like small caps are barely off the relative lows," a team led by Mike Wilson, Morgan Stanley's chief US equity strategist, wrote. Other forecasters on Wall Street have also expressed faith in the market's long-running upward trend. Speaking to CNBC on Tuesday, Wharton economist Jeremy Siegel said he believed the bull market still had further to go, pointing to incoming Fed rate cuts, strong corporate earnings, and historically normal valuations in the S&P 500 when excluding the Magnificent Seven companies. "September being historically really the worst month of the year. Listen, you know, certainly we could have a pullback," he said. "I still think the bull trends are intact." Now could also be a good time for investors to diversify their portfolio in the bond market, strategists at Société Générale wrote in a note last week. The European bank pointed to a thinning gap between the performance of equities and bonds in recent months. A separate analysis from Apollo Global Management found that investment grade corporate bonds and short-term US Treasurys had been outperforming expected returns in the S&P 500 in recent years, based on the index's forward earnings. "Diversification into bonds is becoming beneficial again, especially in the US," SocGen wrote. In its latest weekly commentary, BlackRock also said it had a strategic, five-year call on bonds. "We are overweight short-term inflation-linked bonds as US tariffs could push up inflation," strategists wrote in a note last month. "The bottom line is that fixed income remains more attractive than the implied yield levels in public equity markets at the moment," Torsten Sløk, Apollo's chief economist, wrote last week. Stephanie Link, the chief investment strategist at Hightower Advisors, said she liked areas of the market that were considered to be less expensive compared to the broader S&P 500 index. Speaking to CNBC on Tuesday, she highlighted housing in particular, given that activity in the sector is showing some signs of ramping up. Existing home sales in the US crept up 2% on a seasonally adjusted year-over-year basis in July, thanks partly to the small improvement in housing affordability, the National Association of Realtors said. Housing stocks have also tended to do well at a time when earnings across the broader market have struggled, Link noted. "I am a big housing bull. I think that we're just starting to see a recovery in housing," she said. "We have maybe a rocky six weeks. So I think you take advantage of that," she added of the broader seasonal weakness in markets. "I think the fourth quarter is going to be very strong. And so I think you want to be buying some of the volatility." Ryan Detrick, the chief market strategist at Carson Group, said he was favoring the market's leading large-cap names as stocks head into their historical period of weakness. That's because there's potential for inflation to climb higher, which means the Fed may cut rates less than markets currently expect. Anticipated rate cuts are a major reason why small and mid-cap stocks have rallied in recent weeks. "What does that mean? Well, I stick with who brought you to the dance. Those large caps," he told CNBC last week, adding that he also had exposure to areas like industrials and financials. "We're not overweight small- and mid-caps here." "You look at the kind of leadership, I love it. What's even lagging, like even more," he added, pointing to large-cap laggards in areas like consumer staples and consumer discretionary. Stocks also had strong momentum heading out of August, which is a positive sign for equities even amid seasonal weakness, Detrick said. At the end of the second-to-last week of the month, 90% of stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange were in the green. That's an extremely rare occurrence in financial markets, with only 12 instances of that happening since 1980, he said. "So even if we have a little seasonal weakness, after a 30% rally, I think it's going to be contained," Detrick said of any coming pullback. Jump to

Title: 10 Investment Must Reads for This Week (Sept. 2, 2025)

The explosion of competition in semi-liquid funds could lead to fee compression, according to FundFire. The ETF market is becoming flooded with “slop”, writes ETF.com. These are among the investment must-reads we found this week for financial advisors. September 2, 2025 What’s Next for Semi-Liquid Funds? Fee Compression “Managers rushing to develop alts strategies for the advisor market have not only been chasing vast sums of high-net-worth capital but also the prospect of higher fees than they can generate from mutual funds or private vehicles. And managers have mostly found investors willing to pay the base fees for semi-liquid alts funds.” (FundFire) ETF Slop: How Wall Street Flooded the Market With Gimmick Funds “Just as AI slop means endless articles, videos, and posts that are easy to create and empty of substance, ETF slop means endless new tickers that deliver little of lasting value. So far in 2025, issuers have launched nearly 700 ETFs, already close to last year’s record with four months still left to go. With more than 4,600 ETFs now listed in the U.S., about 15% of the entire market has been born this year alone. And much of it is slop.” (ETF.com) What Investors Need to Know About Private Assets Managers “Traditional public market asset managers have partnered with alternatives managers to develop strategies. For the managers, it seems like a win-win situation: Public market asset managers get quicker and probably cheaper access to private asset deals and operational insight, while private market managers get an “in” to public market asset managers’ existing retail or wealth channel distribution networks.” (Morningstar) Vanguard Hires Nuveen’s Stout to Head Private Markets Strategy “Vanguard Group hired an outsider to head its strategy for private markets, signaling that Chief Executive Officer Salim Ramji intends to make a bigger push into the asset class.” (Bloomberg) Why You Should Pay Attention to Active ETFs “Active managers long held out on ETFs because of their daily transparency. Some companies went to great lengths to create nontransparent ETFs for this reason. But the benefit of opacity is unclear for investors.” (Morningstar) Why Apollo CEO Marc Rowan says the traditional investing model is ‘broken’ “With the stock market increasingly driven by passive investing and indexing, and dominated by a handful of mega-tech stocks, investors seeking diversification will need to start turning to the rapidly expanding private markets, Rowan told CNBC.” (CNBC) Alts Demand Driving Up Specialist Pay, Divisional Head Hires “Asset managers are ponying up more to hire product specialists as demand for alternative investments intensifies – and they're bringing on additional divisional leaders to support the growing mix of specialists and generalists. Average total compensation for advisor-facing specialists reached $322,563 in the second quarter of 2025, up nearly 13% from a year earlier, according to data from Cerulli Associates.” (FundFire) US sliding towards 1930s-style autocracy, warns Ray Dalio “Hedge fund billionaire Ray Dalio has warned Donald Trump’s America is drifting into 1930s-style autocratic politics — and said other investors are too scared of the president to speak up.” (Financial Times) How BlackRock and Goldman Sachs are bringing Wall Street’s hottest asset class to 401(k)s “Wall Street’s largest firms are championing a new cause. They are bringing alternative assets — once reserved for the ultra-wealthy — to the portfolios of individual investors.” (CNBC) REITs Own 570,000 Properties in the U.S. “Data centers had the largest year-over-year increase, up 15% from 2023 to 352 properties at the end of 2024. Retail, storage, and apartment property types all had increases of 30% or more since 2018, with retail up 39%, storage up 33%, and apartment up 30%. Retail also had the second highest annual increase, up 9%.” (Nareit) Related:Social Media, Video Gaming ETFs Outperform YTD Due to Global Growth Prospects David Bodamer Editorial Director, WealthManagement.com David Bodamer covers investments for WealthManagement.com, including hosting the Wealth Management Invest podcast.

Title: Prospective Thames Water rescuers make big promise
URL: https://news.sky.com/story/thames-water-rescue-plan-promises-20-5bn-investment-13423819
Time Published: 2025-09-02T14:46:00Z

A consortium of Thames Water creditors is seeking the agreement of the regulator for its updated operational investment proposals to avert the prospect of being wiped out, should their rescue bid fail. Business and economics reporter @SkyNewsBiz Wednesday 3 September 2025 00:12, UK The group of Thames Water lenders aiming to rescue the company have set out plans for £20.5bn of investment to bolster performance. The proposals, submitted to the regulator for consideration, include commitments to spending £9.4bn on sewage and water assets over the next five years, up 45% on current levels, to prevent spills and leaks respectively. Of this, £3.9bn would go towards the worst performing sewage treatment sites following a series of fines against Thames Water, and other major operators, over substandard storm overflow systems. It said this would be achieved at the 2025-30 bill levels already in place, so no further increases would be needed, but it continued to argue that leniency over poor performance will be needed to effect the turnaround. The creditors have named their consortium London & Valley Water. It effectively already owns Thames Water under the terms of a financial restructuring agreed early in the summer but Ofwat is yet to give its verdict on whether the consortium can run the company, averting the prospect of it being placed in a special administration regime. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Thames is on the brink of nationalisation because of the scale of its financial troubles, with debts above £17bn. Without a deal the consortium, which includes investment heavyweights Elliott Management and BlackRock, would be wiped out. Ofwat, which is to be scrapped under a shake-up of oversight, is looking at the operational plan separately to its proposed capital structure. The latter is expected to be revealed later this month. Sky News revealed on Monday that the consortium was to offer an additional £1bn-plus sweetener in a bid to persuade Ofwat and the government to back the rescue. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Mike McTighe, the chairman designate of London & Valley Water, said: "Over the next 10 years the investment we will channel into Thames Water's network will make it one of the biggest infrastructure projects in the country. "Our core focus will be on improving performance for customers, maintaining the highest standards of drinking water, reducing pollution and overcoming the many other challenges Thames Water faces. "This turnaround has the opportunity to transform essential services for 16 million customers, clean up our waterways and rebuild public trust." Read more from Sky News:Value of pound sinksUK hit by toxic cocktail of market shifts Be the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free The government has clearly signalled its preference that a market-based solution is secured for Thames Water, though it has lined up a restructuring firm to advise on planning in the event the proposed rescue deal fails. A major challenge for the consortium is convincing officials that it has the experience and people behind it to meet the demands of running a water company of Thames Water's size, serving about a quarter of the country's population.

Title: Texas Suit V. Blackrock Et Al Could Undermine Trump’s Energy Agenda
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidblackmon/2025/09/02/texas-suit-v-blackrock-et-al-could-undermine-trumps-energy-agenda/
Time Published: 2025-09-02T13:59:33Z
Full Content:
ByDavid Blackmon, Senior Contributor. In a move demonstrating that big oil companies aren’t the only targets of energy-related lawsuits, a coalition of state attorneys general led by Texas AG Ken Paxton recently sued major investment firms including BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street. The complaint, filed last December in a Texas federal court, alleges that the defendants illegally colluded to buy up stock in various coal companies and force them to lower output via implementation of internal ESG-focused policies. Mr. Paxton said in a press release introducing the lawsuit that the big investment firms have created a “cartel to rig the coal market, artificially reduce the energy supply, and raise prices,” adding, “their conspiracy has harmed American energy production and hurt consumers.” But U.S. coal prices have dropped dramatically since 2023, and overall coal production has been in decline throughout the 21st century. Despite coal’s decline, America’s mineral energy renaissance has transformed our country’s outlook, enhancing its energy security in the process. Once heavily dependent on foreign suppliers to meet demand, last year the U.S. produced more mineral energy than ever before – and output is projected to increase further this year. This extraordinary turnaround is in large part the result of free markets being allowed to do what they do best: compete. This is certainly the case in the oil and gas business, where thousands of producers ranging from small mom-and-pop operators to the biggest major integrated companies in the world compete in a vibrant marketplace. It has even remained true in the coal industry despite an array of command-and-control interventions enacted during both the Obama and Biden presidencies. Mr. Paxton and some of the Republican AGs who have signed onto the plaintiff coalition have been outspoken proponents of President Donald Trump and his efforts to reverse much of the Biden and Obama regulatory morass. So, regardless of the merits of the complaint, it is at least interesting that the group’s lawsuit proposes a big government solution. That proposed remedy asks that that the government force these asset managers to divest their holdings in coal companies entirely, a move that could strip the industry of nearly $18 billion in capital. That could be ruinous to a sector which has been in decline for decades. It would also present real trouble for Energy Secretary Chris Wright’s goal of delaying planned retirements of more than 100 gigawatts of coal-fired power plants, which he discussed in President Trump’s August 26 cabinet meeting. After all, it costs real money to pay for the upkeep and operations of that many coal power plants. Somebody has to foot the bill, and it won’t be the federal government. Former Texas Governor Rick Perry, who served as Energy Secretary throughout the first Trump presidency from 2017-2021, called the lawsuit "misguided" last month in a Washington Times op-ed. Perry warned that a decision for the plaintiffs would likely undermine Trump's energy agenda, calling the case “not conservative. That’s not pro-business. And it’s certainly not pro-energy dominance.” Surely, there must be more constructive ways to debate energy policy. In fact, the last election served in many ways as a referendum on the Biden-Harris administration’s aggressive green agenda – one that Trump and his cabinet officials say made a mess of America’s energy security. Should the plaintiff states prevail in this case, what would that mean for the many oil and gas companies who adopted many of the same ESG-focused internal policies which these coal companies implemented in their efforts to adapt to the political and market realities of the moment to maximize investor returns? Those companies were advised every day of every week for years to move in that direction by an array of major advisory firms for whose advice they paid millions of dollars. This kind of litigation also raises the specter of the tables being reversed whenever the political pendulum swings back in the other direction, which it inevitably will do. The resulting tit-for-tat governance might chill investment and raise the cost of capital at precisely the time when large-scale energy investments are most needed. During the 2024 campaign, President Trump promised to reinvigorate “beautiful, clean coal” as part of an all-of-the-above energy plan – a laudable goal to meet America’s rapidly growing energy needs. Shoring up resilience and reliability on the nation’s power grids by ensuring the maintenance of adequate 24/7 baseload generating capacity is a major piece of that agenda. Secretary Wright and other Trump officials believe coal still has a big role to play in that space. Achieving the President’s vision will require serious investment by the private sector as government subsidies are gradually removed from the equation, and much of that capital investment must be provided by the defendant firms in this case. Policymakers should be working to unleash capital markets, not jam them up. But, despite that reality, the Trump Justice Department’s antitrust division and Federal Trade Commission tacitly endorsed the lawsuit in July with the filing of a statement of interest, saying the actions by the defendants could reduce competition and raise prices for consumers. This begs the question of who the agencies believe will step in to pony up $18 billion in new capital to fund the ongoing operations of the 100 gw of coal plants Sec. Wright wants to keep in operation if the government forces this mass divestiture. It isn’t as if alternative investors are clamoring at the gates to invest in the coal business these days. Regardless of the ultimate outcome of this litigation targeting Blackrock and other big investment houses, it serves to vividly illustrate the complexities endemic to investing big money in the energy business in the United States today. None of this is simple or easy: If it was, everybody would be doing it.

Title: St John of God Brothers to end involvement in hospital and healthcare group as new group chief is announced

New CEO Jerry Dempsey St John of God religious order Brothers are to step away from its health and hospital organisation as a new group chief executive was announced today. Jerry Dempsey will take over the St John of God Hospitaller Services Group (SJOG HSG). It includes the St John of God Hospital in Dublin and St John of God Community Services, which deliver intellectual disability and community mental health services at various locations throughout Ireland. It was announced today that Mr Dempsey will bring 25 years of executive management experience with a background spanning healthcare services, pharmaceuticals and environmental services in Ireland, the UK, and the USA. New CEO Jerry Dempsey Today's News in 90 seconds - September 2nd He has “extensive experience leading mission-driven organisations in regulated multi-stakeholder environments where trust, compliance and service quality are paramount", according to a spokesperson. “Previous roles held include Managing Director of Greenstar, CEO of Ashfield Healthcare USA and Chief Commercial Officer of healthcare and life sciences company Complete Laboratory Solutions. Jerry has led organisations through periods of significant growth and transformation while successfully balancing commercial acumen and financial sustainability underpinned by a strong person-centred approach,” they said. “His breadth of experience positions him to professionally progress the ongoing transformation of St John of God Hospitaller Services Group and its affiliated entities, while championing the enduring values of compassion, hospitality and respect that are central to the mission and purpose of St John of God.” A spokesperson said the announcement coincides with further changes in board membership arrangements in line with ongoing governance reforms. The formation of SJOG HSG commenced in 2006 when the Hospitaller Order of St John of God (the Order) began planning for a future where the Brothers would no longer lead the mission, due to advancing age and declining vocations. A series of developments over the intervening years has led to a planned reduction of Order involvement across both the operations and governance of the SJOG entities, they said. “The next phase of the ongoing transition process will see the remaining Irish and UK Brothers now stepping down from the SJOG HSG and SJOG Malawi Boards and transitioning off all remaining entity Boards by the end of 2025. This will mark a pivotal moment in the organisation's evolution, entrusting leadership and governance fully in the hands of committed lay people,” they added. Mr Dempsey said: "I am honoured to take up the role of Group CEO at this transformative time for the St John of God Group. The Order has laid a remarkable foundation for the task ahead with over a century and half of dedicated service and leadership. "I am confident we can continue to fulfill the mission of Saint John of God by building a cohesive, resilient and sustainable future, adapting to emerging requirements and meeting unmet need while delivering impactful, compassionate care to those in need. Ensuring the dignity and well-being of the people we are entrusted to support and helping them to reach their full potential, remains our central focus." Dr Tony Hanna, chair of the board added: “We are delighted to confirm Jerry Dempsey’s appointment as Group CEO. He brings a wealth of professional experience and corporate expertise to this role as we enter a new era in the Group’s development. We acknowledge the invaluable contribution the Order has made over the past 150 years in helping the most vulnerable in our society. We will continue to lead the services with the utmost respect and commitment to that legacy.” In June, Aidan Clohessy, a former school principal was convicted of the indecent assault of six boys over a 30 year period and jailed for four years. He was principal of ST Augustine’s School in Blackrock from the early 1970s to 1993. He entered the St John of God religious order in 1958. In a statement, the Order of Saint John of God said it has “long recognised the need and desire for lay people to exercise greater leadership roles in the governance of the works and services of the West European Province, which includes Ireland”. The Order also recognised that there was a desire of lay people to play an active and leadership role in promoting, expanding and furthering the mission and that lay people would bring "particular and valued experience and expertise in meeting the needs of people and also enhance overall governance”. To support this vision, and mindful of the declining number of Brothers and their age profiles, a process was initiated with the primary aim of ensuring the continuation into the future, of the mission and work of the Order of Saint John of God, it added.

Title: Rising star catch-up: Anna Ashurov details her journey from Goldman Sachs to Anheuser-Busch to BlackRock
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/blackrock-exec-details-career-path-from-goldman-to-ab-inbev-2025-8
Time Published: 2025-09-02T09:02:01Z
Full Content:
Anna Ashurov has been busy. A 2018 member of Business Insider's rising stars list, Ashurov has changed companies twice since her stint at Goldman Sachs, going from the investment bank to the world's largest beer brewer and then to the world's largest asset manager, where she's worked since 2021. Ashurov now oversees growth strategy and client relationships for Aladdin, BlackRock's widely used risk analytics and portfolio management tech. She told Business Insider, she's focused on "driving growth holistically" instead of structuring deals and advising clients. We caught up with her on her career changes, and she shared advice for those considering a big leap. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity. BI: What has your career been like since Business Insider featured you on our 2018 rising stars list? AA: When I spoke to your colleagues last, I was at Goldman, in leveraged finance and capital markets. I purposefully wanted to be more on the operating side, and I transitioned into a role within the financing division at Goldman — it was essentially a chief of staff for the financing division. And that gave me a perspective on the operating side within the firm. From there, I was hired by AB InBev to lead their commercial strategy and transformation. And that was essentially my introduction to being on the operating side, leading commercial strategy, leading market build-out. We had a ton of interesting work that we were doing in our beyond beer strategy, doing some interesting acquisitions. And as I was getting deeper into the operating field, I had an inbound from BlackRock to join the Aladdin business, which to me was absolutely fascinating. And I decided to make that move. Ultimately, what drove me or drew me to BlackRock was its unique position at the intersection of finance, technology, and innovation. I've always been interested in how technology can transform industries. So to me, that was a perfect opportunity to join the fintech world, and I've been here since then. It's been a fun ride. This story is part of a new series catching up with finance pros we once spotlighted as Rising Stars of Wall Street to see where their careers have taken them. See all of our past Rising Stars lists here. BI: What core skills from your time at Goldman do you still use today? AA: My background in finance has been foundational for my current role, and I even think in my role at AB InBev. So early on, I built deep relationships with institutional clients, which taught me how to understand their needs and different challenges, and to deliver solutions. That sort of client-centric perspective is what I brought with me, and that is essential to creating long-term value. At AB InBev, I had the opportunity to drive commercial strategy and lead those transformational initiatives, so that also gave me the hands-on experience of aligning business priorities and delivering operational execution that I brought here as well. I had to learn all about technology, which I haven't done before, but I think some of the foundational skills and being a client-facing executive are something that I'd ultimately apply anywhere. BI: You've been tasked, in an operating role, with growing brands that many would consider to be the leaders in their space. BlackRock is the world's largest asset manager, while AB InBev is the world's largest brewer. How do you grow established brands while retaining what got them to this point? AA: It's easier to do when the organization has foundational cultural values, right? AB InBev is a big conglomerate, but at the same time, it was absolutely flat in terms of structure. I had direct access to Michel Doukeris, who's the CEO of the organization, and direct access to the head of strategy — the organization was so agile and nimble that you were able to make decisions and drive change. Same thing at BlackRock. In order for you to be able to actually impact the organization, impact its growth, impact the strategy, and make the difference that you are there to make, you need to have the proper cultural foundation to be able to actually effectuate that change. Both of the organizations have that. BI: You've now worked in different industries, including some known for long hours and grueling schedules. Have you kept a similar routine as far as your day-to-day as you shifted between jobs? Is there something you've kept the same even as your roles have changed? AA: I do read during my commute. That's actually probably the only time when I have time to read. So I love when I have like an hour-and-a-half commute, I read both ways or I listen to podcasts, but often I read. I like fiction, I like murder mysteries. That's my time to decompress and release and do something different, because I am kind of on all the time. BI: What advice would you give someone who is thinking of making a big career move? Maybe someone who has had some success in their career but is thinking of changing industries or firms, as someone who has taken that leap. AA: If I reflect on my journey and look back at my career, the one sort of constant is that I've grown through change. Do not be afraid of change. For me, it's always been important to not become complacent and to continue to feel challenged. It's important to continue pushing yourself. Jump to

Title: Labor group holds first Labor Day parade in Boston: ‘Workers are fed up with billionaires’

Union members rallied in Boston Monday during a Labor Day parade hosted by the Greater Boston Labor Council. Organizers cast the event as a “historic display of worker solidarity” that replaced the city’s customary Labor Day breakfast at the Park Plaza. GBLC President Darlene Lombos said the parade was “a statement.” “Workers are fed up with billionaires who hijack our democracy while pushing brutal cuts to the very programs that create jobs and keep our communities strong — everything from infrastructure investment to education and health care,” Lombos said in a statement. Political figures from across Massachusetts joined the event, including U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey, U.S. Rep. Ayanna Pressley, Gov. Maura Healey, Attorney General Andrea Campbell, and Boston Mayor Michelle Wu. The march started on Boston Common near the State House, and then continued to the first public school in the country on School Street, the BlackRock corporate offices on State Street, Faneuil Hall on Congress Street, a site run by SEIU Local 32BJ on Sudbury Street, the JFK Federal Building on Sudbury Street, and Boston City Hall Plaza. The march in Boston coincided with a number of Labor Day-related events happening across the country, including a rally in front of Trump Tower in New York.

Pluribus Unum BlackRock has finally come for our utilities.Here’s this, from a new article by Katya Schwenk at Jacobin:BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has its tentacles in all facets of American life. The behemoth is buying up grocery brands, dental practices, apartment buildings, and nursing homes. But the opaque industry of private equity has mostly stayed away from electric utilities, the regulated companies that supply power to homes and businesses, because they often don’t yield quick returns.That’s changing. Last year, the BlackRock subsidiary Global Infrastructure Partners and a Canadian pension fund announced a $6.2 billion deal to buy Minnesota Power….That deal faced tremendous pushback, and is not yet official, but here’s where things get really conspiratorial: after a judge issued a heavyhanded ruling against the acquisition, unions and “clean energy” advocacy organizations have come out of the woodwork to support the BlackRock takeover—Schwenk writes that when the proposed deal was announced, BlackRock executives “put the climate transition at the center of their pitch.” The “clean energy” groups with their “climate crisis” boogeyman strike again.Schwenk also uncovers some rather incestuous connections too:In at least one instance, union comments bear the fingerprints of an attorney working for BlackRock, document metadata shows.And:One of these [clean energy] groups is currently advertising a benefit event sponsored by Minnesota Power and the law firm representing BlackRock in the deal.And, it’s not just BlackRock. Another big player on Wall Street, Blackstone, is also in on the game, which recently announced its plans to acquire “a major electric utility in Texas and New Mexico” if permitted to do so.So why are these global investment firms turning their attention to our energy suppliers?

But the opaque industry of private equity has mostly stayed away from electric utilities, the regulated companies that supply power to homes and businesses, because they often don’t yield quick returns.That’s changing.

Title: Ethereum Over Bitcoin? Matt Hougan Says Institutions Sometimes Start With ETH

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan has stated that a growing number of professional investors are skipping Bitcoin and turning directly to Ethereum as their first crypto investment. This has long been regarded as the entry point into digital assets, and Bitcoin is now sharing the spotlight with Ethereum. In Ripdoteth’s update on X, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan has revealed on live that an interesting trend is emerging. He claims that many professional investors are bypassing Bitcoin and going directly to Ethereum, whose utility in decentralized finance, smart contracts, and Web3 applications is increasingly drawing institutional capital. The reason he explains is rooted in how institutions already think about portfolio construction. According to the expert, most professional investors don’t actually own gold. This is because Gold is considered a niche asset, with perhaps only 15% to 20% of institutions holding it, while the vast majority of 80% or more invest in stocks and bonds. Since Bitcoin is often framed as digital gold, its appeal is limited for many professionals who never allocated to gold in the first place. “A lot of people look at Bitcoin like it’s digital gold. I don’t own gold, but I do own technologies,” Hougan stated. ETH fits naturally into the portfolios of those who already allocate to innovative technologies. With tokenization and stablecoins gaining traction, he expects institutional flow into ETH to continue building momentum. While institutions see Ethereum as the exposure to the technological backbone of a digital economy, Wall Street FOMO has hit historic levels, as the US institutional appetite for ETH is reaching unprecedented heights. Crypto trader Bull Theory has highlighted that in August 2025 alone, Ethereum Spot ETFs purchased $3.87 billion worth of ETH, driven almost entirely by professional investors chasing long-term exposure. Leading the charge is $11 trillion asset manager BlackRock, which allocated $3.38 billion worth of ETH and $707 million in Bitcoin, highlighting a clear preference for ETH over BTC. This wave of institutional buying pushed Ethereum to new all-time highs in August. Importantly, the majority of these purchases are intended for long-term holdings, reducing immediate sell pressure and supporting sustained price momentum. If ETH closes above $4,630, it will mark the highest monthly close since the 2021 bull run. Furthermore, Ethereum’s transaction volumes surged past $320 billion on-chain, reflecting broad engagement across decentralized finance, stablecoins, and tokenized assets. Meanwhile, staking continues to attract Wall Street attention, with nearly 36 million ETH, which is 29% of the total circulating supply, now locked in staking contracts. With 3% staking rewards, Ethereum provides institutional investors with a steady dividend, making it more appealing for long-term portfolios.

My name is Godspower Owie, and I was born and brought up in Edo State, Nigeria. I grew up with my three siblings who have always been my idols and mentors, helping me to grow and understand the way of life. My parents are literally the backbone of my story. They’ve always supported me in good and bad times and never for once left my side whenever I feel lost in this world. Honestly, having such amazing parents makes you feel safe and secure, and I won’t trade them for anything else in this world. I was exposed to the cryptocurrency world 3 years ago and got so interested in knowing so much about it. It all started when a friend of mine invested in a crypto asset, which he yielded massive gains from his investments. When I confronted him about cryptocurrency he explained his journey so far in the field. It was impressive getting to know about his consistency and dedication in the space despite the risks involved, and these are the major reasons why I got so interested in cryptocurrency. Trust me, I’ve had my share of experience with the ups and downs in the market but I never for once lost the passion to grow in the field. This is because I believe growth leads to excellence and that’s my goal in the field. And today, I am an employee of Bitcoinnist and NewsBTC news outlets. My Bosses and co-workers are the best kinds of people I have ever worked with, in and outside the crypto landscape. I intend to give my all working alongside my amazing colleagues for the growth of these companies. Sometimes I like to picture myself as an explorer, this is because I like visiting new places, I like learning new things (useful things to be precise), I like meeting new people - people who make an impact in my life no matter how little it is. One of the things I love and enjoy doing the most is football. It will remain my favorite outdoor activity, probably because I'm so good at it. I am also very good at singing, dancing, acting, fashion and others. I cherish my time, work, family, and loved ones. I mean, those are probably the most important things in anyone's life. I don't chase illusions, I chase dreams. I know there is still a lot about myself that I need to figure out as I strive to become successful in life. I’m certain I will get there because I know I am not a quitter, and I will give my all till the very end to see myself at the top. I aspire to be a boss someday, having people work under me just as I’ve worked under great people. This is one of my biggest dreams professionally, and one I do not take lightly. Everyone knows the road ahead is not as easy as it looks, but with God Almighty, my family, and shared passion friends, there is no stopping me.

Title: “No More Bears”: Michael Saylor Sees Bitcoin Charging Toward $1 Million Milestone
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/no-more-bitcoin-bears-saylor-says/
Time Published: 2025-09-01T13:00:04Z

The current bearish wave seems to have significantly disrupted the bullish action of Bitcoin, which has forced the largest cryptocurrency asset to revisit downside targets like the $108,000 price mark. While this action has triggered speculations about a potential bear market phase, Michael Saylor’s latest statement suggests that this period of volatility could be laying the groundwork for a notable surge. Strategy co-founder and chairman Michael Saylor has dropped a bombshell on the ongoing bearish period and the future price target for Bitcoin. During an interview on Bloomberg, the chairman declared that the bear market is not coming back and BTC’s price could rise to a million-dollar value. Saylor, who has long defended Bitcoin as the best digital gold substitute and ultimate store of value, thinks that the cryptocurrency is the cornerstone of the contemporary financial system. This status is being cemented by its increasing institutional adoption, tightening supply dynamics, and growing demand worldwide. In the interview shared by Trending Bitcoin, the chairman emphasized that the market has gone past the bearish phase, indicating that the market is entering a new era. During these moments of heightened volatility, Saylor believes that BTC is heading to $1 million if it does not fall to zero. The founder has attributed this anticipated price target to several key factors, especially in the political landscape. According to Saylor, BTC has secured notable support from US President Donald Trump, the Cabinet, Scott Bessent, Paul Atkins, among others, as the crypto king matures into a global reserve asset. As BTC gains mainstream recognition, Saylor is confident that banks, particularly in the US, will eventually start to custody Bitcoin. This is because Bitcoin has gone through its riskiest period, and the accounting has been corrected. BTC’s supply continues to shrink, with only 450 BTC available for sale each day by natural sellers, also regarded as minors. When these coins are bought at a rapid rate, demand for BTC is likely to increase, and its price will grow sharply. Institutions are significantly demonstrating interest in BTC as they set out to add the asset to their treasuries. Saylor revealed that these big firms, such as BlackRock, are acquiring a huge portion of the daily natural supply of BTC. Considering these factors, Saylor remains confident that BTC’s price is moving higher, hitting between $500,000 and $1 million. “At the current price level, it only takes $50 million to turn the entire driveshaft of the crypto economy,” the founder added. However, in the event of a bearish phase, he claims that BTC could crash to the $250,000 range. Saylor’s latest remarks reflect Strategy’s robust interest and conviction in BTC’s long-term potential. Despite the current waning price action, the firm continues to accumulate the asset at a rapid rate. The founder recently hinted at another potential buy this week, as he highlighted that Bitcoin is still on sale while sharing a chart of Strategy’s BTC holdings.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with 40-year-old Dugal Bain-Kim, a former BlackRock executive who founded a longevity startup in 2021. It has been edited for length and clarity. My first job in finance was the lowest rung on the European equities team at BlackRock. I was young, had a full tank of energy, and was just generally excited to have moved from my home in Australia to London. I was pumped to be living in what felt like the center of the world, working in finance. There was a lot of energy that came from the novelty of being able to earn my first real paychecks, having serious conversations, and just going out and making the best of London outside work. Around my fourth year at BlackRock, I became a VP at the firm, making low six-digit pounds. It felt great. Making decent money was something that was genuinely important to me for my career. It is for a lot of people. But I started to notice a shift in my energy at work. I'd been focused on getting the promotion for a while, and I got it. Then there was a bit of a come-down. There always is, but it sort of turned more into a bit of a funk. As I thought about it, I noticed that there were some people in the office who you could tell genuinely loved working in finance. On the weekend, they read The Financial Times cover to cover, and they chatted to each other about financial statements in the cafeteria. You could just tell that they were doing what they were meant to be doing, and they got a lot of energy from it. Then you could see that there were other people who, even if they were still pretty good at their jobs, were forcing it. They were doing it from extrinsic motivation, not intrinsic motivation — extrinsic motivation being money, status, promotions, perks, whatever it might be. As I started to notice that distinction, I definitely saw myself fitting into the second category. Finance wasn't what I would be thinking about in my own time. It's not what I wanted to talk about with people. I also felt that, at least on the investment-management side, a lot of the time, you were sort of this expert observation group that looked at people in the field, building and running companies, and then judged whether they were doing a good job. In those conversations, I noticed myself getting more and more curious-slash-envious abound the people who were actually in the field. I was in my late 20s when I left finance. It was kind of a sweet spot in my career, where I'd gotten paid decently along the way, but my lifestyle hadn't expanded so much that I was tied to the paycheck. I realized that I wanted to be in a sector that gave me multiple ways to win in my career. Meaning that if I worked on something, I would still be proud of the work I've done at the end of my career, regardless of success or earnings. I also wanted to work on something I felt was net beneficial for society and problems that I felt were important, which is a very personal decision. I have a history of people very close to me having very serious health issues. It's been a dominant theme for my family: How do you navigate the healthcare system, how do you advocate for yourself, how do you get access to the things that people can get access to if they have a lot of money and connections? When I started reading about the first generation of digital health companies using technology platforms to solve that problem, it hit very close to home. In 2021, I founded Lifeforce, a longevity medical program. There was a little bit of fear at first. It's a little bit like skiing — when you're standing on the top of the mountain about to tip your skis over. But honestly, by that point, the greater fear had become the regret of not having tried. I'm really pleased with the decision. It was definitely the right move and the ideal place for me to be. I don't regret my time in finance. It gave me a really good foundation for thinking about companies, how to think about markets, and even how to think about the workplace — what that's like and how to navigate different office dynamics. For example, how do you present yourself to more senior people? How do you work with other colleagues? It was a very professional, high-performance training ground that I think was generally very good for me. I would totally be open to my daughters working in consulting or finance for at least a few years to start their careers. I think it would give them a valuable set of fundamentals that will be useful in so many other ways. But I would also counsel them to be open-minded about whether it's a long-term or short-term thing. Those years in the professional world also helped me find out how I'm wired to think about work and what motivates me. Not everyone wants to work in a deeply mission-driven organization that happens to align with the cause that's most important to them. Frankly, it's not actually how a lot of people are wired. There are a lot of people who can actually do really well based on extrinsic motivations. They can feel happy about that, and that's awesome. Good luck to them as well. Once you understand that, it starts to inform what sort of "athlete" you are and, therefore, where you should take your career. Jump to

The technology may be challenging to master and expensive to build today, but fusion promises to harness the nuclear reaction that powers the sun to generate nearly limitless energy here on Earth. If startups are able to complete commercially viable fusion power plants, then they have the potential to upend trillion-dollar markets. The bullish wave buoying the fusion industry has been driven by three advances: more powerful computer chips, more sophisticated AI, and powerful high-temperature superconducting magnets. Together, they have helped deliver more sophisticated reactor designs, better simulations, and more complex control schemes. It doesn’t hurt that, at the end of 2022, a U.S. Department of Energy lab announced that it had produced a controlled fusion reaction that produced more power than the lasers had imparted to the fuel pellet. The experiment had crossed what’s known as scientific breakeven, and while it’s still a long ways from commercial breakeven, where the reaction produces more than the entire facility consumes, it was a long-awaited step that proved the underlying science was sound. Founders have built on that momentum in recent years, pushing the private fusion industry forward at a rapid pace. Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) has raised about a third of all private capital invested in fusion companies to date. Its latest round, which closed in August, added $863 million to its coffers, bringing its total raised near $3 billion. CFS’s Series B2 came four years after its $1.8 billion Series B, which helped catapult the company into the pole position. Since then, the startup has been hard at work in Massachusetts building Sparc, its first-of-a-kind power plant intended to produce power at what it calls “commercially relevant” levels. Sparc’s reactor is a tokamak design, which resembles a doughnut. The D-shaped cross section is wound with high-temperature superconducting tape, which, when energized, generates a powerful magnetic field that will contain and compress the superheated plasma. Heat generated from the reaction is converted to steam to power a turbine. CFS designed its magnets in collaboration with MIT, where co-founder and CEO Bob Mumgaard worked as a researcher on fusion reactor designs and high-temperature superconductors. The Massachusetts-based CFS expects to have Sparc operational in late 2026 or early 2027. Later this decade, the company says it will begin construction on Arc, its commercial power plant that will produce 400 megawatts of electricity. The facility will be built near Richmond, Virginia, and Google has agreed to buy half its output. CFS is backed by a long list of investors, including Breakthrough Energy Ventures, The Engine, Bill Gates, and others. Founded in 1998, TAE Technologies (formerly known as Tri Alpha Energy) was spun out of the University of California, Irvine by Norman Rostoker. It uses a field-reversed configuration, but with a twist: after the two plasma shots collide in the middle of the reactor, the company bombards the plasma with particle beams to keep it spinning in a cigar shape. That improves the stability of the plasma, allowing more time for fusion to occur and for more heat to be extracted to spin a turbine. The company raised $150 million in June from existing investors, including Google, Chevron, and New Enterprise. TAE has raised $1.79 billion in total, according to PitchBook. Of all fusion startups, Helion has the most aggressive timeline. The company plans to produce electricity from its reactor in 2028. Its first customer? Microsoft. Helion, based in Everett, Washington, uses a type of reactor called a field-reversed configuration, where magnets surround a reaction chamber that looks like an hourglass with a bulge at the point where the two sides come together. At each end of the hourglass, they spin the plasma into doughnut shapes that are shot toward each other at more than 1 million mph. When they collide in the middle, additional magnets help induce fusion. When fusion occurs, it boosts the plasma’s own magnetic field, which induces an electrical current inside the reactor’s magnetic coils. That electricity is then harvested directly from the machine. The company raised $425 million in January 2025, around the same time that it turned on Polaris, a prototype reactor. Helion has raised $1.03 billion, according to PitchBook. Investors include Sam Altman, Reid Hoffman, KKR, BlackRock, Peter Thiel’s Mithril Capital Management, and Capricorn Investment Group. Pacific Fusion burst out of the gate with a $900 million Series A, a whopping sum even among well-funded fusion startups. The company will use inertial confinement to achieve fusion, but instead of lasers compressing the fuel, it will use coordinated electromagnetic pulses. The trick is in the timing: All 156 impedance-matched Marx generators need to produce 2 terawatts for 100 nanoseconds, and those pulses need to simultaneously converge on the target. The company is led by CEO Eric Lander, the scientist who led the Human Genome Project, and president Will Regan. Pacific Fusion’s funding might be massive, but the startup hasn’t gotten it all at once. Rather, its investors will pay out in tranches when the company achieves specified milestones, an approach that’s common in biotech. Shine Technologies is taking a cautious — and possibly pragmatic — approach to generating fusion power. Selling electrons from a fusion power plant is years off, so instead, it’s starting by selling neutron testing and medical isotopes. More recently, it has been developing a way to recycle radioactive waste. Shine hasn’t picked an approach for a future fusion reactor, instead saying that it’s developing necessary skills for when that time comes. The company has raised a total of $778 million, according to PitchBook. Investors include Energy Ventures Group, Koch Disruptive Technologies, Nucleation Capital, and the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation. Now its third decade, General Fusion has raised $462.53 million, according to PitchBook. The Richmond, British Columbia-based company was founded in 2002 by physicist Michel Laberge, who wanted to prove a different approach to fusion known as magnetized target fusion (MTF). Investors include Jeff Bezos, Temasek, BDC Capital, and Chrysalix Venture Capital. In General Fusion’s reactor, a liquid metal wall surrounds a chamber in which plasma is injected. Pistons surrounding the wall push it inward, compressing the plasma inside and sparking a fusion reaction. The resulting neutrons heat the liquid metal, which can be circulated through a heat exchanger to generate steam to spin a turbine. General Fusion hit a rough patch in spring 2025. The company ran short of cash as it was building LM26, its latest device that it hoped would hit breakeven in 2026. Just days after hitting a key milestone, it laid off 25% of its staff. CEO Greg Twinney penned an open letter pleading for funding from investors. In August, they delivered somewhat, injecting $22 million in an pay-to-play round that one investor called “the least amount of capital possible” to keep the General Fusion afloat. Tokamak Energy takes the usual tokamak design — the doughnut shape — and squeezes it, reducing its aspect ratio to the point where the outer bounds start resembling a sphere. Like many other tokamak-based startups, the company uses high-temperature superconducting magnets (of the rare earth barium copper oxide, or REBCO, variety). Since its design is more compact than a traditional tokamak, it requires less in the way of magnets, which should reduce costs. The Oxfordshire, U.K.-based startup’s ST40 prototype, which looks like a large, steampunk Fabergé egg, generated an ultra-hot, 100 million degree C plasma in 2022. Its next generation, Demo 4, is currently under construction and is intended to test the company’s magnets in “fusion power plant-relevant scenarios.” Tokamak Energy raised $125 million in November 2024 to continue its reactor design efforts and expand its magnet business. In total, the company has raised $336 million from investors including Future Planet Capital, In-Q-Tel, Midven, and Capri-Sun founder Hans-Peter Wild, according to PitchBook. Zap Energy isn’t using high-temperature superconducting magnets or super-powerful lasers to keep its plasma confined. Rather, it zaps the plasma (get it?) with an electric current, which then generates its own magnetic field. The magnetic field compresses the plasma about 1 millimeter, at which point ignition occurs. The neutrons released by the fusion reaction bombard a liquid metal blanket that surrounds the reactor, heating it up. The liquid metal is then cycled through a heat exchanger, where it produces steam to drive a turbine. Like Helion, Zap Energy is based in Everett, Washington, and the company has raised $327 million, according to PitchBook. Backers include Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures, DCVC, Lowercarbon, Energy Impact Partners, Chevron Technology Ventures, and Bill Gates as an angel. Most investors have favored large startups that are pursuing tokamak designs or some flavor of inertial confinement. But stellarators have shown great promise in scientific experiments, including the Wendelstein 7-X reactor in Germany. Proxima Fusion is bucking the trend, though, having attracted a €130 million Series A that brings its total raised to more than €185 million. Investors include Balderton Capital and Cherry Ventures. Stellarators are similar to tokamaks in that they confine plasma in a ring-like shape using powerful magnets. But they do it with a twist — literally. Rather than force plasma into a human-designed ring, stellarators twist and bulge to accommodate the plasma’s quirks. The result should be a plasma that remains stable for longer, increasing the chances of fusion reactions. Marvel Fusion follows the inertial confinement approach, the same basic technique that the National Ignition Facility used to prove that controlled nuclear fusion reactions could produce more power than was needed to kick them off. Marvel fires powerful lasers at a target embedded with silicon nanostructures that cascade under the bombardment, compressing the fuel to the point of ignition. Because the target is made using silicon, it should be relatively simple to manufacture, leaning on the semiconductor manufacturing industry’s decades of experience. The inertial confinement fusion startup is building a demonstration facility in collaboration with Colorado State University, which it expects to have operational by 2027. Munich-based Marvel has raised a total of $161 million from investors including b2venture, Deutsche Telekom, Earlybird, HV Capital, and Taavet Hinrikus and Albert Wenger as angels. First Light dropped its pursuit of fusion power in March 2025, pivoting instead to become a technology supplier to fusion startups and other companies. The startup had previously followed an approach known as inertial confinement, in which fusion fuel pellets are compressed until they ignite. First Light, which is based in Oxfordshire, U.K., has raised $140 million, according to PitchBook, from investors including Invesco, IP Group, and Tencent. Though nothing about fusion can be described as simple, Xcimer takes a relatively straightforward approach: follow the basic science that’s behind the National Ignition Facility’s breakthrough net-positive experiment, and redesign the technology that underpins it from the ground up. The Colorado-based startup is aiming for a 10-megajoule laser system, five times more powerful than NIF’s setup that made history. Molten salt walls surround the reaction chamber, absorbing heat and protecting the first solid wall from damage. Founded in January 2022, Xcimer has already raised $109 million, according to PitchBook, from investors including Hedosophia, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Emerson Collective, Gigascale Capital, and Lowercarbon Capital.

Aoife Ryan\u002DChristensen Brainstorm Analysis: Property prices are still rising, not just because of supply but because of wages, demographics and population size Property prices in Ireland continue to be on the rise. The latest Property Price Index figures from the Central Statistics Office show that prices increased by 7.8% overall (8.0% on houses and 6.6% on apartments) in the 12 months to June 2025. The figures also show prices have been going up every month for two years now. The figures use the median price rather than the average: this gives a more accurate picture because the median isn't skewed by extreme outliers in the figures. While the median price of a dwelling purchased in the 12 months to June 2025 was €370,000, there are big differences across the country: The highest median price for a home (house or apartment) in the 12 months to June 2025 was €675,000 in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, while the lowest median price was €190,000 in Leitrim. The region with the highest median price was Dublin, with a median price of €486,000. Within Dublin, the most expensive area was Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, where the median price was €675,000. The least expensive area within Dublin was Fingal, which had a median price of €460,000. Outside of Dublin, the most expensive region over the last 12 months was Wicklow, with a median price of €450,000. The second most expensive region was Kildare, which had a median price of €425,000. The least expensive region over the last 12 months was Leitrim, where the median price paid for a dwelling was €190,000.

This data shows the most expensive Eircode area over the 12 months to June 2025 was A94 (Blackrock, Dublin) with a median price of €780,000, while F45 (Castlerea, Roscommon) had the least expensive price of €148,000.

"Because for the last three years 95% of all new housing in Dublin, for example, has been apartments, and 95% of those have been for rent, what you're going to see is house price inflation outside, in the greater Dublin area and going further out to your Westmeaths and your Longfords and places like that," says Dr Lorcan Sirr, Senior Lecturer in TU Dublin and housing policy analyst. "You're going to see more of that as people move further away from the urban core to buy homes, because there's nothing to buy in in the large urban areas. It's the same in Cork but to a lesser extent. You're going to see house price inflation continue, because the drivers of house price inflation aren't just the number of houses. It's also things like wages. Then there's demographics, the population is going up."

"So there's a whole load of other factors aside from the actual number of houses that we have, that influence house prices - and none of those are going in the right direction [for house prices to come down]." "There's nothing there that indicates to me that house prices are going to come down," he says. "The other factor is, people forget that of all the houses we build every year, in the last four or five years, less than 30% of them actually come to your estate agent for you to go and buy. The rest of them are snapped up by the State, or one-off homes and so on. There’s less and less actual supply on the market." "I suspect what you'll find is price inflation gathering pace further and further away from urban cores, as people move because nobody wants to rent. Yet government policies are directed towards incentives to rent. It’s bizarre."

Title: AI Agents Are Already Reshaping Business Leadership And Decision Making
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2025/09/01/ai-agents-are-already-reshaping-business-leadership-and-decision-making/
Time Published: 2025-09-01T05:28:46Z
Full Content:
ByBernard Marr, Contributor. When it comes to the work that can be carried out by AI agents, we often focus on repetitive and routine tasks. The types of tasks that machines can get really, really good at if they perform them again and again. Examples include writing and scheduling social media posts, solving routine customer service issues, or labelling and categorizing unstructured data. In case you’re not up to speed, agents can be thought of as generative AI chatbots like ChatGPT but with virtual arms, legs and the ability to take action on our behalf. A slightly more technical definition is that they are large language models (like ChatGPT’s GPT-5 engine) capable of connecting with other tools, including web browsers, to carry out more complex and sophisticated tasks, with minimal human intervention. But it would be wrong to think that agentic AI is only useful for low-level, tactical decision-making on the shop floor; What time should you send an email newsletter? Or which piece of machinery needs maintenance work? In fact, it’s increasingly being used by business leadership to make strategic or management decisions. One McKinsey study recently found that 53 percent of C-suite executives and 44 percent of middle managers use GenAI at work, putting them well ahead of the total overall figure. So here, I’ll take a look at some of the ways that agents are already making their way into business management functions. I’ll also provide some tips for anyone who wants to make sure they’re prepared for the convergence of agents and business leadership. No one will expect the average CEO to be ready to hand over control of their company to a machine any time soon. But there are many theoretical and a growing number of real-world use cases for agents in leadership and high-level decision-making. One of the most visible is through integration with the decision support systems often used to augment human decision-making by ensuring we have the information and guidance we need. For example, luxury goods manufacturer LVMH recently announced its decision to build a platform that will use agents to monitor and surface signals so decision-makers can react more quickly. Asset managers BlackRock have developed their own agentic platform, called Asimov. Asimov can work through the night, gathering research data in real time, monitoring market activity and scanning company filings, ready to present an actionable report to executives in the morning. And Citi Group has talked about its plans to divert some of its $12 billion tech budget into agentic AI, which could be used to connect different business AI initiatives, improving strategic oversight. Enterprise software vendors like Microsoft and Salesforce are increasingly building agentic functionality into their tools, to assist decision-makers with strategic advice, or deploying their own agents. This means we’re likely to see agents being used in exciting new ways as adoption grows among leadership in different industries. For example, in healthcare, agents could be used to monitor and oversee an increasingly sprawling connected health infrastructure. This helps leaders understand what's generating value, what's being underused, and what’s just a waste of resources. And in manufacturing, agents can track production operations, supply chain effectiveness and energy efficiency, creating opportunities to make strategic plays. While agents aren’t yet taking the wheel on business decision-making, they’re increasingly in the passenger seat, ready to help us navigate or warn about trouble ahead. So if you’re a leader or a decision-maker, what steps should you be taking to make sure you aren't left behind? Business decision-makers who’ve already had experience with deploying generative AI will be at an advantage here. But agentic AI requires a different approach, more suited to the long-term strategic planning tasks agents are built for. Agents are more big-picture and goal-oriented, and your thinking should be too. While ChatGPT can draft you an email, an agentic platform like Manus or Operator can create an email marketing strategy and build the infrastructure to deliver it. At least, in theory, it can, but it has to be noted that early adopters of those tools frequently report that they don’t always get it right just yet. From a general usage point of view, it's important to remember that AI agents are not simply evolved AI chatbots. They’re not really designed to chat or knock ideas back and forward about the best way to create something, which is something ChatGPT is good at. Agentic AI can be expensive because the "thinking" chews through a lot of tokens. So it’s best to go in with a clear idea of what you want and instruct the agent explicitly on how you would like it to achieve it. One of the great strengths of agents is that they can use digital tools just like we can, from using a web browser to shop online to controlling complex industrial machinery. Preparation for this might involve ensuring that proprietary and legacy systems can be persuaded to play nicely with agents. Or making a commitment towards open-source technology, where standardization is common and popular tools are likely to be quickly patched to work with an agentic ecosystem. Next tip: to fulfil their full potential, agents will need access to fast streams of high-value, timely data via well-documented APIs. Organizations that don’t have their house in order here are likely to miss opportunities as they attempt to catch up. And, absolutely critically, leaders must take steps to ensure they understand the principles of secure, responsible and ethical AI use. As we take steps to give AI the power to make more decisions on our behalf, the need for guardrails, oversight and accountability is more important than ever. Will we get to a point where machines are so good at predicting the right course of action that humans just aren’t needed? Could we even become a liability? Well, maybe one day. It’s pretty hard to know where this technology will be in two or three years, let alone ten years. But one thing we do know is that human brains are still immensely more complex than the best artificial brains. That additional complexity allows us to understand nuanced situations, navigate complex interpersonal relationships and make complex, long-term, strategic plans in ways that computers probably won’t be able to do for some time. This means that human leaders probably aren’t ready to delegate their powers entirely just yet. Instead, they will look to agents to help them become better leaders and more effective decision-makers.

BlackRock has finally come for our utilities. Here’s this, from a new article by Katya Schwenk at Jacobin: BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has its tentacles in all facets of American life. The behemoth is buying up grocery brands, dental practices, apartment buildings, and nursing homes.

ByRussell Flannery, Senior Contributor. Shares in Trip.com, the online travel site that has emerged as one of the China’s most successful private sector start-ups in the past quarter century, climbed to their highest Nasdaq close of 2025 on Thursday after the company said growth in bookings in the April-June quarter lifted revenue and profit. Trip.com closed at $75.03 at the Nasdaq on Thursday – its best since December, before falling back by 1.7% on Friday. Its U.S.-traded shares were still more than 13% higher than a week earlier, and have gained nearly 60% in the past year. In Hong Kong Stock Exchange trading, Trip.com closed up by 4.7% on Friday to HK$578, also its highest finish since December. Trip.com, then known as Ctrip, was founded in 1999 as a disruptor in China’s travel services industry, entering at a time when the field was dominated by offline state-owned companies. Beginning with hotel rooms, it began an Expedia-like online expansion into airline tickets, corporate travel services and even railway tickets. From its $250,000 in start-up capital, Trip.com’s market capitalization at the Nasdaq was $48 billion on Friday. That compares with $26 billion for Expedia. Trip.com said on Wednesday net revenue in the second quarter of 2025 rose by 16% year-on-year to $2.1 billion, helped by stronger travel demand, particularly during holidays. Accommodation reservation revenue for the second quarter rose by more than a fifth to $869 million, it said. Inbound travel bookings surged by more than 100% year-over-year, while outbound hotel and air ticket bookings topped 120% of the pre-COVID level for the same period in 2019. Those gains helped to lift net profit by more than a quarter to $676 million in the second quarter from a year earlier, according to company figures. "Our strategy focuses on capturing growing demand from every demographic, with special attention to inbound travel,” CEO Jane Sun said in a statement. Sun ranked No. 16 on a list of China’s top businesswomen published by Forbes China earlier this year. The company’s co-founders include billionaire venture capitalist Neil Shen, currently the founding and managing partner of HongShan (formerly known as Sequoia China), and Ji Qi, chairman of U.S. listed hotel company H World. Trip.com holds stakes in a number of hotels and resorts, including Atour, whose Nasdaq-traded shares have more then doubled in the past year. Shareholders include Chinese search engine Baidu, which owns about 7% of Trip.com and funds associated with BlackRock, 5.3%. Trip.com over the years has built up a network of more than 1.7 million hotels and flights from over 600 airlines, according to company figures. The site is available in 24 languages and offers 35 local currencies, Trip.com says. Trip.com shares trade at a forward price-earnings multiple of 20, compared with 15 for Expedia, according to media estimates. Expedia’s rises to 27 when you take out “extra items,” per Reuters. One European country notably looking forward to welcoming more Chinese tourists: Italy. Milano Cortina will host the 2026 Winter Olympics, and winter sports have become increasingly popular in China since Beijing hosted in the winter games in 2022.

Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin predicts massive institutional adoption as Wall Street and treasury companies ramp up ETH holdings. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Ethereum co-founder and Consensys CEO Joseph Lubin just gave ETH bulls something to chew on. In a post on X, he applauded Fundstrat’s Tom Lee on his vision for the future of finance and the expanding role of Ethereum in traditional institutions. “Yes, ETH will likely 100x from here. Probably much more.” As a blockchain pioneer, Joseph Lubin is best known as a co-founder of Ethereum and the founder and CEO of Consensys, the largest web3 software studio. Drawing on deep roots in finance as a former Goldman Sachs VP, Lubin has been instrumental in developing Ethereum as the preeminent platform for decentralized finance and smart contracts since 2014. Responding to Tom Lee’s bullish outlook, Lubin predicts a seismic shift in global finance: Wall Street giants will soon run validators, operate L2s and L3s, and write smart contracts to move their business infrastructure onto Ethereum rails. JPMorgan, for example, has used Ethereum-based technology for its permissioned blockchain projects for about a decade and is joined by Goldman Sachs, Onyx, and a growing roster of major banks launching stablecoin and DeFi initiatives on Ethereum. Since June 2025, treasury companies, including Bitmine Immersion and Sharplink Gaming, have added 2.6% of all ETH in circulation to their reserves. When combined with inflows to new ETH ETFs, institutional buyers account for nearly 5% of Ethereum’s supply so far this year. Sharplink and Bitmine now hold over $6 billion in ETH, setting industry benchmarks for corporate adoption. And with the approval of multiple Ethereum ETFs, asset managers like BlackRock and VanEck have invested billions into ETH for their clients, marking a tipping point in its adoption as a primary digital asset for institutional treasuries. Please add [email protected] to your email whitelist. Stay connected via VanEck’s CEO recently dubbed Ethereum “Wall Street’s token,” and Lubin argues that the transformative potential of Ethereum derives from “decentralized trust,” a quality Wall Street sorely needs. As legacy institutions migrate from fragmented, siloed infrastructure to unified decentralized rails, staking ETH becomes both a technical and economic imperative: “Nobody on the planet can currently fathom how large and fast a rigorously decentralized economy, saturated with hybrid human-machine intelligence, operating on decentralized Ethereum Trustware, can grow.” In his view, not only will L2s and L3s drive more usage of the Ethereum base layer, but “ETH will likely 100x from here” and eventually “flippen the Bitcoin/BTC monetary base.” Ethereum’s surging momentum doesn’t come without bumps in the road. September is historically Ethereum’s toughest month, averaging a -6.42% return since 2016. The combination of a meteoric summer rally (up 76% year-to-date, nearly 25% in August) and seasonal trends may see a pullback in the month ahead, especially as macro sentiment, monetary policy, and profit-taking could weigh on prices. Still, bullish fundamentals remain. Net ETH inflows from institutions, the steady climb in corporate treasury holdings, rising yields from staking (~3% APY), and ongoing upgrades all point to a stronger long-term outlook, as Lubin states: “The one quibble that I have with what Tom has been saying, and I keep telling him this: he is not nearly bullish enough.” Christina is a web3 writer, editor, and content manager with a passion for technology and starting important conversations.

Title: Bitcoin, Ethereum ETFs face $291 mln in outflows: Is a market shift coming?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/bitcoin-ethereum-etfs-face-291-mln-in-outflows-is-a-market-shift-coming/

Could Ethereum be gearing up to outshine Bitcoin? Ethereum and Bitcoin ETFs saw sharp outflows on the 29th of August, with ETH funds losing $164.6 million and BTC funds $126.6 million, amid renewed macroeconomic pressure. Ethereum’s [ETH] impressive streak of ETF inflows in August has come to a halt, closing the month on a note of heavy withdrawals. According to data from Farside Investors, ETH ETFs registered a sharp outflow of $164.6 million on the 29th of August. It effectively ended six consecutive days of strong inflows that had drawn nearly $1.9 billion into the market. Grayscale’s ETHE product led the retreat with $61.3 million in outflows, followed by $51 million from Fidelity’s ETH fund, $28.6 million from Grayscale’s other ETH offering, and $23.7 million from Bitwise. Other issuers, including BlackRock, saw no net flows on the day. The reversal coincided with Ethereum’s price action, trading at $4,442 after a 6.75% weekly decline, though it managed a slight 1% recovery in the past 24 hours as per CoinMarketCap. A similar trend played out on the Bitcoin [BTC] side, where ETFs recorded combined outflows of $126.6 million, the first day of losses since 22nd August. The largest outflow came from 21Shares’ ARKB, which lost $72.1 million, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC with $66.2 million withdrawn, while Grayscale’s GBTC recorded $15.3 million in exits. However, the pain wasn’t universal, as BlackRock’s IBIT attracted $24.63 million and WisdomTree’s BTCW added $2.3 million, though most other issuers reported flat activity. This aligned with Bitcoin slipping 5.32% over the week but was changing hands at $108,783.89 with a modest 0.6% rebound in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. The timing of these outflows further aligned with fresh macroeconomic data out of the U.S. In July, the Federal Reserve’s favored measure of inflation, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, increased by 2.9% compared to last year, marking its fastest rise since February. The hotter-than-expected print raised speculation about prolonged tight monetary policy, dampening appetite for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. However, despite the near-term jitters, optimism around Ethereum’s long-term prospects remains intact. Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin echoed the bullish thesis of Fundstrat’s Tom Lee, both projecting that ETH’s valuation could climb by as much as 100 times over the coming years. Lubin noted, “Yes, ETH will likely 100x from here. Probably much more. Yes, Ethereum/ETH will flippen the Bitcoin/BTC monetary base.” Lookonchain’s on-chain analytics highlighted that a long-term Bitcoin investor recently moved 2,000 BTC, valued at $217 million, into Hyperliquid to swap it for spot Ethereum. This shows a growing conviction among some seasoned players that Ethereum could outperform in the next cycle. In fact, as per AMBCrypto’s recent analysis, many market watchers believe that Q4 could ignite an Ethereum-led rally, with ambitious projections of a possible climb toward $10,000. If this becomes the case, then the recent outflows may be little more than a pause before Ethereum reclaims center stage in the crypto market.

Title: ETH And BTC ETFs Reverse Gains With $291M In Outflows Ahead Of New Week

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. US-based crypto ETFs have witnessed a change in dynamics in August, which has seen inflows tipping towards Ethereum ETFs. However, last week’s trend of strong inflows ended with substantial outflows on Friday, with Ethereum ETFs leading the retreat with $164.64 million and Bitcoin ETFs following with $126.64 million. This sudden reversal coincides with an interesting timing of stubborn inflation data that seems to have rattled institutional investors. According to data from Farside Investors, US-based Spot Ethereum ETFs ended the week with $164.64 million in outflows. The outflows came from Fidelity’s FETH with $51 million, Bitwise’s ETHW with $23.7 million, Grayscale’s ETHE with $28.6 million, and Grayscale’s ETH with $61.3 million. BlackRock, on the other hand, witnessed neither inflows nor outflows into its Spot ETH ETFs, alongside 21Shares, VanEck, Invesco, and Franklin Templeton Ethereum ETFs. Friday’s outflows were a jarring departure from the steady gain that had defined Ethereum’s Spot ETFs since August 21. Ethereum’s six-day inflow streak, which had added about $1.876 billion, was brought to an abrupt end with the outflows on Friday. As a result, total assets under management for Spot Ethereum ETFs dipped to $28.58 billion. Ethereum ETF Flow: Farside Investors Meanwhile, Spot Bitcoin ETFs also recorded their first daily decline since August 22 with $126.64 million in outflows on Friday. As a result, their total assets under management dropped to $139.95 billion. However, not every issuer felt the pressure with Bitcoin. Fidelity’s FBTC led the exodus with $66.2 million, followed by ARKB’s $72.07 million and GBTC’s $15.3 million in outflows. On the other hand, BlackRock’s IBIT still managed $24.63 million in inflows and WisdomTree’s BTCW drew in $2.3 million amid the wider outflows. Bitcoin ETF Flow: Farside Investors The underlying cause of the outflows can be attributed to investors digesting the latest data on inflation released on Friday. Notably, the US core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index climbed 2.9% year-over-year in July, the fastest pace since February, creating fears that the Federal Reserve may hold off on rate cuts. As a new trading week begins, Spot ETF flow in both Ethereum and Bitcoin is likely to depend on how investors continue to interpret the data. If inflation pressures persist, institutional investors may retreat further at the beginning of the week. However, any signs of cooling could see inflows resume mid-week, particularly into Ethereum, where fundamentals are currently favorable. On the price side of things, Bitcoin’s hold above the $108,000 price may offer some relief. However, it needs to stay above $110,000 in order for any upside move to gain momentum. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $109,910. For Ethereum, a daily close above $4,500 could confirm the return of bullish confidence, whereas a slide below $4,400 might signal further weakness. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $4,470, up by 1.7% in the past 24 hours.

Title: I missed out on my first choice in Trinity. Will CAO points drop in round two?

I missed out on my first-choice course – business, economics and social studies in Trinity – by 23 points in last Wednesday’s round of CAO offers. I have been offered another business degree programme in Dublin, but really want to study Bess in Trinity. What are the chances points will drop in later rounds? The chances of a high-demand course such as Bess at Trinity dropping in points by this margin is remote, based on trends over previous years. This means you have until 3pm on Tuesday, September 2nd, to accept the lower preference offer you received last Wednesday. After that, the offer lapses. If you are appealing grades in this year’s Leaving Cert, remember, there is usually a one-in-four or one-in-five chance of getting an upgrade, based on previous trends. If your mind is really set on securing a place in Bess at Trinity and you don’t accept your lower preference offer today, you have a number of options: 1. Repeat the Leaving Cert, hoping to secure higher scores next year. This route, once popular, has diminished in numbers in recent years. 2. Apply for a place in one of the business or law programmes offered by further education colleges in the next few days. You can access a list of all such level-five PLC (post-Leaving Cert) programmes online (Qualifax.ie). These programmes are usually assessed through a series of eight modules or assignments which students submit monthly from October-May. Further education (FE) or PLC courses as a route into university are probably one of the best-kept secrets of the education system. Many students – and parents – still don’t know enough about them, even though they offer an excellent route to third level, outside the pressure cooker CAO points system. In fact, there are more than 1,000 CAO courses across all areas which admit PLC students. In your case, I am aware of FE students who, having completed their level-five business or law programme, secured an offer of a place in Bess at Trinity. But in every case that I am aware of, the applicant secured distinctions across all eight modules in their course. This is a very useful pathway for students who need a year to prepare themselves for the challenges of university life. In PLC courses, students tend to have the time and space to develop more independent learning skills, learn to work in teams and deliver projects on time and to a high standard. So, if your heart really is set on Bess, why not seek a place on a locally based business PLC programme immediately. Blackrock Further Education College, for example, offers separate level-five programmes in both business and law. In the unlikely event you receive enough upgrades in the Leaving Cert, or the points requirements drop significantly in the coming weeks, you will receive a late offer from the CAO, which you could then accept.

Title: Breda O’Brien: Interest in Jim Gavin says little for Micheál Martin’s faith in his party colleagues

Since 2011 Micheál Martin has shaped Fianna Fáil more than any other individual. While most acknowledge his relentless work ethic while rebuilding a party in danger of collapse, not every supporter is happy with where he has steered Fianna Fáil. He has done much to improve Fianna Fáil’s perceived image of being cute hoors who were fond of the odd brown envelope. However, he has also alienated many grassroots supporters. They were particularly baffled by his disastrously out-of-touch support for the 2024 Family and Care referendums. His approach to the presidential election has also exposed his distance from his parliamentary party. He seemed disinclined to have Fianna Fáil contest the election at all. However, the symbolic nature of the office remains important, even if securing it has recently resembled the Hunger Games more than an electoral process. A presidential election allows individuals and parties to interrogate their values and present them to the public. Perhaps Fianna Fáil no longer really knows what it stands for. It is not as if there was any scarcity of shy but willing candidates, including Martin’s former close ally, Billy Kelleher. Bertie Ahern, Mary Hanafin and Éamon Ó Cuív, although very different characters, seemed to inspire the same terror as the Ghost of Christmas Past, causing Martin to cry out like Ebenezer Scrooge, “Leave me! ... Haunt me no longer!” Martin’s reasons for opposing Ahern’s run have been well-rehearsed. He has no desire to remind the electorate of being central to Ahern’s team as the economy went into catastrophic meltdown. Hanafin probably lost her chance of a nomination in 2014. She defied instructions to withdraw her candidacy in the local elections in the so-called Battle of Blackrock. Despite winning with relative ease, Hanafin stood in the way of Martin’s preferred type of candidate, a young woman with impeccable liberal credentials, Kate Feeney. (She also got elected.) Éamon Ó Cuív is a distinct case. He epitomises the stark change in the values of Fianna Fáil since 2011. Although reared in Dublin, his focus has been on community capacity-building, particularly in rural areas, ever since he became the manager of a Gaeltacht development co-operative in Corr na Móna. He has always fought for a State responsive to its people, rather than an impenetrable bureaucracy. He has remained a constitutional nationalist and passionate advocate for the Irish language. He is the antithesis of a finger up to the wind politician and has clashed with Martin on everything from going into Coalition to the Fiscal Compact treaty. For some, he is the great lost leader who could have upheld the better instincts of Fianna Fáil, the localist – as opposed to clientelist – tradition that simply aimed to ensure everyone had a chance of a decent life. [ Former Dublin GAA manager Jim Gavin as Fianna Fáil’s presidential candidate? The pros and consOpens in new window ] Ó Cuív stubbornly plods on with unpopular causes, like visiting republican prisoners in Maghaberry, because he cares about moving them towards useful lives, not how it plays as PR. At the moment Heather Humphreys appears to be the front-runner. Despite Martin’s relentless focus on bringing women into politics, why does he judge Fianna Fáil incapable of fielding a seasoned female politician who would appeal in the same way to middle Ireland? Although strong, capable, articulate and intelligent women, neither Deirdre Heenan nor Siofra O’Leary has political experience or name recognition. (I should disclose that I remember O’Leary fondly as a competent and well-liked head girl in the school where I taught.) Fianna Fáil’s last female presidential candidate was closer to the party’s original values. We have to scrape away the intervening years and remember Mary McAleese before she took to accusing mild-mannered Pope Leo of courting Maga money and Pope Francis of being a “careless pope” and “sometimes narky showman.” She was allegedly too much the green nationalist, too divisive to be a good president. Instead, she and her husband, Martin, did much to advance peace in Ireland. Yes, 1997 was a different time, but Fianna Fáil knew the kind of person they wanted, a woman who had contested an election and had a clear vision of the Ireland she wanted to represent. There is a tendency to dismiss the approach of every president before Mary Robinson as having nothing to offer contemporary Ireland. The underrated Patrick Hillery, who incidentally laid most of the groundwork for free education before Donogh O’Malley took his solo run, proved his mettle when it was most needed. When Charles Haughey attempted to pressure his former colleague not to dissolve the Dáil to enable Fianna Fáil to form a government without a new election, Hillery sent him packing and protected an Army officer whom Haughey had tried to intimidate. The “mature recollection” of this incident later derailed Brian Lenihan’s attempt at the presidency. There is something to be said for a president who does not self-identify as an activist. Yet the proposed – at the time of writing – selection of Jim Gavin, while a decent man of solid Clare Fianna Fáil stock, highlights Martin’s obsession with success in Dublin. It also signals that a once-dominant party lacks an electable politician or former politician embodying its core beliefs. What does that say about the party Martin has shaped and his confidence in his colleagues? © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Munster dominate Leinster to win Interpro championship

Munster lifted the Vodafone Women’s Interprovincial Championship trophy for the first time since January 2023, delivering a dominant performance to beat Leinster 50-15 at Energia Park. It was a disappointingly one-sided final, but that should not take away from Munster’s sizzling seven-try display as they cruised past the three-in-a-row hopefuls Leinster, even without injured top try scorer Chisom Ugwueru and vice-captain Stephanie Nunan. A barnstorming first-half performance from Matt Brown’s side had them leading 31-0 at the break, with Chloe Pearse, in her final appearance in red, Deirbhile Nic a Bháird (2), and Aoife Corey sharing out the tries. Centre Caitríona Finn, the player-of-the-match for the third time in the Championship, tallied up 20 points in all, really stamping her mark on the game after only making her first senior start for Munster three weeks ago. Tries from Munster captain Maeve Óg O’Leary, Finn, and Eilís Cahill made it 50 unanswered points, before Leinster, whose new head coach Ben Martin handed out 20 debuts across the four-match series, gained some late consolation. Harder hit by their Rugby World Cup representation, and perhaps also by last week’s tough encounter with Connacht, the defending champions rallied with tries from replacement Katie Whelan (63 and 73 minutes), and Vicky Elmes Kinlan (80). Munster, who had already won 33-22 in Donnybrook in round 2, lost both O’Leary and Gráinne Burke to the sin bin during the final quarter, but their efforts over the opening hour had made certain of a clean sweep of victories, and their 16th Interprovincial crown overall. The title winners’ tight nucleus of senior players, led by inspirational backrower O’Leary, who had a fantastic return to the Interprovincial stage after two knee surgeries, combined very effectively with their emerging young talent this summer.

Title: Historic Flip: Bitcoin ETFs On Pace To Surpass Gold ETFs In AUM

In the dynamic financial sector, Bitcoin ETFs are rapidly gaining ground against their gold counterparts, with inflows pushing total assets under management toward record highs. Bitcoin ETFs are set to overtake gold ETFs in total assets under management. Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) are on the brink of making history globally. In an X post, the Kobeissi Letter, an industry-leading commentary on global capital markets, has revealed that BTC ETFs are on track to surpass Gold ETFs in assets under management (AUM) for the first time in history, marking a historic milestone in global markets. Over the past 12 months, AUM in the largest cryptocurrency ETFs has doubled to $150 billion, while gold ETFs have climbed 40% to a record of $180 billion. The comparison highlights how rapidly momentum has shifted. Just three years ago, gold ETFs were five times larger than Bitcoin ETFs. Presently, with accelerating inflows into digital asset products, that gap is narrowing at a historic speed. If current trends continue, Bitcoin ETFs could surpass gold ETFs as early as next year. This is a symbolic flip that underscores the rise of crypto from speculative asset to mainstream portfolio allocation. Lately, ETFs are proving to be the engine behind the current crypto bull market. According to Ucan_Coin, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, oversees nearly 2,000 funds, with about 1,400 of them being ETFs. Clients buy into these funds, while BlackRock earns fees on the assets under management. However, the Bitcoin Spot ETF fee is just 0.25%, but the power lies in scale and liquidity. Over the last two years, ETFs have provided the critical fuel for this rally, with nearly 20% of all liquidity entering crypto now flowing directly from ETF products. As Ucan_Coin highlights, BlackRock’s IBIT stands out. As the chart demonstrates, IBIT is the locomotive pulling the entire market, driving inflows and setting the pace for the broader bull run. The US spot Bitcoin ETFs are gaining remarkable momentum, while generating $5 to $10 billion in daily volume on their most active trading days. Pushpendra Singh, Co-founder of PushpendraTech and SmartViewAi, has explained that this surge is a clear sign that institutional investors are increasingly seeking regulated exposure to Bitcoin, and ETFs are rapidly becoming their preferred gateway. Despite the ETF boom, Binance continues to dominate the spot market, processing between $10 to $18 billion in daily spot volume and holding a 29% market share. This is more than double the 13% market share currently held by US-based ETFs, and it puts Binance comfortably ahead of other major exchanges in terms of liquidity.

Title: Ethereum: How a potential squeeze could push ETH to $5,000

Can Ethereum sustain its dominance over all altcoin sectors, or is this outperformance nearing its limit? Ethereum outperformed other altcoin sectors as supply shrank and whale bets mounted. With transactions hitting records and ETH rebounding, the question remains: can this momentum spark a sustained rally? Ethereum [ETH] traded higher on the daily chart, logging modest gains over the past 24 hours. The altcoin continued to steer the season, extending its outperformance against Bitcoin [BTC]. The altcoin’s rally has been fueled by whale and institutional accumulation, with retail also joining the train. Most of the altcoin sectors had, however, shifted back to closing in the red. Comparing ETH to other altcoin sectors, it showed clear leadership this month. ETH led with a performance reading of 0.20, slightly higher than those of Layer 2s (L2) and DeFi tokens. By mid-August, DeFi and L2s briefly led, but ETH reclaimed the lead into month-end. Naturally, DePin and AI tokens trailed just below. Source: Glassnode As Q3 2025 closed in, sectors such as gaming, AI, and staking posted losses. In fact, Ethereum stood out as the leader of capital rotation. On the weekly price action, ETH wicked to $4,900 before rejection. The spike signaled a potential rally, breaking a double top near $4,000. Recent price action tested the $4,400 zone, a recovery from the dip below $4,300. As of press time, ETH was only up by about 13%. Source: TradingView If ETH advanced toward $4,800, large liquidation clusters could trigger resets. On top of that, $7.23 billion in ETH short positions risked a squeeze, potentially propelling the price toward $5,000. Additionally, the supply of Ethereum was shrinking with whales, institutions, and retail scooping up more ETH. In fact, staking contributed to the supply shock, with nearly 30% of ETH staked. BlackRock reportedly accumulated nearly $1 billion worth of ETH over a week. Meanwhile, a whale went long on Hyperliquid with 25x leverage at $4,380, building a $4.39 million position, per CryptOpus. More importantly, the monthly transaction count hit a new ATH of 46.99 million with still a day left. This was in play despite the month of August seeing a reduction in gains. Source: Ted Pillows/X DEX volume stood at $135 billion, while TVL reached $240 billion. Moreover, Active Addresses surpassed 15 million. Altogether, Ethereum stayed ahead of its peers, with strong on-chain momentum reinforcing its dominance.

Title: Crypto ETF Surge Could Reshape Market, but Many Products May Fail

A deluge of crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could hit U.S. markets as early as this fall, potentially changing how both institutional and retail investors access the digital asset space. But while some see it as a turning point for mainstream adoption, others are already bracing for inevitable casualties. “The crypto ETF floodgates are set to open this fall, and investors will soon be swimming in these products,” said Nate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth Management. He believes most of the 90-plus crypto ETF applications currently filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will be approved — assuming they meet the final listing requirements. Ultimately, though, said Geraci, investors — not regulators — will decide which products thrive. “The beautiful aspect of the ETF market is that it’s a meritocracy, where investors vote with their hard-earned money. The market naturally sorts out the winners from the losers, so I’m not overly concerned about there being too many crypto ETFs floating around.” To Geraci, the demand for more diverse and accessible investment options is already there — and underappreciated. “Given the initial response to futures-based and 1940 Act-structured Solana and XRP ETFs, I believe demand for 1933 Act spot products in these crypto assets is being severely underestimated – much like we saw with spot bitcoin and ether ETFs,” he said. The iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), managed and issued by BlackRock, became the most successful ETF launch in the history of those vehicles, now holding nearly $85 billion worth of bitcoin on behalf of investors. While the ether ETFs initially saw much smaller demand than their bitcoin counterparts, a recent surge in interest in the Ethereum blockchain’s native token has seen inflows for the group well surpass those for bitcoin ETFs. Ether ETFs have taken in nearly $10 billion since the start of July, which represents the bulk of total inflows of $14 billion since their launch last year, according to James Seyffart, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. Geraci also anticipates strong uptake for index-based crypto ETFs, which he says will give investors and advisors “a straightforward way to gain exposure to the broader digital asset ecosystem.” For smaller, less-known tokens, he admits demand will depend heavily on the strength of each project’s fundamentals. “As you move further down the crypto market cap spectrum, I expect demand for spot ETFs will be more closely tied to the success of individual projects and the performance of their underlying assets — factors that are difficult to forecast at this stage,” he said. Seyffart agrees that the pipeline of crypto-related products is about to burst — but he’s more skeptical about how many will stick. “If all of those filings ultimately launch, there will undoubtedly be some closures within the next few years,” Seyffart said. He expects “decent demand for plenty of these products,” but believes expectations need to be calibrated—especially for altcoins. “I’m not sure that some of these longer tail altcoins will be able to have 5+ successful ETFs,” he said. “If people are gauging their success on the level of bitcoin ETFs — they will be severely disappointed. But if others are expecting all of them to fail — they will also be severely disappointed.” In his view, the market is entering a test phase where issuers will throw many products at the wall to see what sticks. “These issuers are gonna launch a lot of products and try to find something that sticks,” Seyffart said. He predicts the next 12 to 18 months will see “hundreds of crypto-related ETP launches.” Both analysts agree on a central point: the ETF format creates a highly competitive landscape where investor interest is the ultimate arbiter of success. While SEC approval might open the gates, it’s asset flows that will determine who stays afloat. In the ETF world, product closures are a feature — not a flaw. Just like in the stock market, low demand or poor performance can lead funds to shut down. For investors, that means not every new crypto ETF will be worth betting on, even if it carries the name of a popular blockchain project. For example, a Solana ETF might find buyers if the underlying token continues to attract developers and users. But five separate ETFs based on the same coin? That’s where both Seyffart and Geraci say the market will likely intervene. “If demand doesn’t show up, those products will close,” Seyffart said. Behind this boom is the broader institutional acceptance of crypto. Since the SEC approved spot bitcoin and ether ETFs last year, asset managers have rushed to file new offerings tied to Solana SOL$209.63, XRP, dogecoin DOGE$0.2192 and many others and even basket funds tracking multiple coins. These products give traditional investors a regulated way to access crypto markets without setting up wallets or managing private keys. But with that access comes the responsibility to be discerning. “In the end, investors will decide which products make sense and which don’t,” Geraci said. “That’s how the ETF market has always worked.” And with hundreds of crypto funds potentially hitting the market soon, that decision may need to come quickly.

Title: Ken Paxton's attack on investors is climate change denial, not conservatism

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton revealed first to 'The Ingraham Angle' that he'll be campaigning for U.S. Senate. Each summer and fall, southern states brace for the destructive force of hurricane season. From Florida to the Carolinas, families face a routine ritual: prepare and pray. But the storms are becoming stronger. The flooding is now more severe, and the economic toll increases every year. In 2024, the United States endured 27 separate weather and climate disasters costing a combined $182.7 billion – one of the costliest years on record. As former Republican congressmen who represented southern districts in Florida and South Carolina, climate change isn’t abstract. Miami is seeing rising tides. North Carolina has been battered by torrential flooding. Energy grids have buckled under record-breaking heat. These risks are real, and they are reshaping our economy, insurance markets and communities. RICK PERRY SAYS KEN PAXTON'S ENERGY LAWSUIT WILL HURT US COAL COMPANIES That is why conservatives must reclaim the climate conversation. Sadly, today’s debate is too often dominated by the loudest partisan voices. On the far left, some prescribe sweeping mandates and federal micromanagement that threaten innovation and growth. On the far right, others—ironically in the name of conservatism—are turning the tools of government against private companies, punishing them for evaluating the financial impacts of climate risk. Take Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton’s lawsuit against BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard. He claims these firms formed an "investment cartel" by coordinating their consideration of climate risk, effectively conspiring to disadvantage coal producers and traditional energy companies. But that framing badly misrepresents reality. As the Wall Street Journal editorial board noted, coal production increased during the very period Paxton points to — undermining his claim of an anti-energy conspiracy. What he calls collusion is, in fact, routine fiduciary judgment: investors weighing risks and making portfolio choices. That’s not a cartel. That’s an efficient market working as it should. Assessing risk, whether from hurricanes, regulation, or technological disruption, is the essence of responsible investing. If an asset manager concludes that coastal real estate is more vulnerable to flooding, or that insurance payouts are skyrocketing in certain regions, adjusting portfolios accordingly isn’t "woke capitalism." It’s their fiduciary duty. It’s to safeguard the value of their portfolios. It’s exactly how free markets are supposed to function. Some of Texas’s most respected conservative leaders see this clearly. Rick Perry, former governor and energy secretary during the first Trump administration, has criticized Attorney General Paxton’s lawsuit, warning that weaponizing state power against investors undermines the very energy agenda conservatives claim to support. Perry has rightly argued that free markets, not lawsuits and political intimidation, are the best way to ensure American energy security and economic resilience. He argues true freedom means defending the right of businesses and investors to assess risk as they see fit. (Steve Gonzales/Houston Chronicle via Getty Images) Conservatives have long championed the principles of limited government and individual liberty. But when politicians intervene to dictate investment strategies or intimidate firms for recognizing climate risks, they abandon those very principles. The real conservative position is simple: the freedom to invest must be protected. American investors and companies must be able to manage all business risks and opportunities to remain profitable and competitive. Across the country, center-right voices are beginning to step up and lead on this issue. Institutions like the Cato Institute, the National Taxpayers Union, R Street, and federal and state lawmakers are demonstrating how market-based approaches can preserve freedom, drive innovation, and prepare our communities for the realities of climate change. We will all convene later this month in New York City to share how conservatives can chart a path forward. BlackRock offices. (Wikipedia) This is not about choosing between the environment and the economy. It is about unleashing American ingenuity to confront financial risks, create opportunities, and strengthen resilience. Conservatives should be the ones insisting that the marketplace — not government mandates — decides how to adapt and invest for the future. The stakes are clear. If we cede the conversation, the public will be left with a false choice between big-government mandates from the left and big-government meddling from the right. Both are wrong. Conservatives must stand for freedom. For families rebuilding after storms, for entrepreneurs developing clean technologies, and for investors responsibly assessing risks. Here in America, we must firmly defend the freedom to invest. Republican Bob Inglis represented South Carolina’s 4th Congressional District from 1993 to 1999 and then again from 2005 until 2011.

Title: Best Altcoins to Buy Now as Ripple CEO Predicts $25T Crypto Market by 2030

The total crypto market cap has grown by nearly 400% in the last three years, from $727B in October 2022 to a staggering $3.72T at the time of writing. That kind of growth is unheard of in traditional stock market indices. But wait until you hear what Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse thinks is next for crypto. Keep reading to discover why Ripple’s boss predicts such explosive growth for crypto, his insights on Ripple’s own token, $XRP, and how you can position yourself for this potentially outrageous rally by loading up on the best altcoins to buy now. Garlinghouse cited the vulnerability of traditional fiat currencies as the biggest reason behind his extremely bullish crypto outlook. He explained that macroeconomic pressures on fiat are all but certain to intensify in the coming years, which could push traditional currencies toward devaluation and long-term instability. Amid such uncertainty, digital assets provide more than just hope; they’re built specifically to plug the holes in the global financial system, offering transparency, efficiency, and inflation-resistant store of value that fiat currencies simply can’t match. As one of the biggest cryptocurrencies targeting the cross-border payments market, many believe $XRP could become one of the biggest success stories in the next few years. All in all, with prominent industry voices bullish on crypto’s long-term growth, everyday investors will fare extremely well if they simply exercise patience during slightly deeper consolidations like the one we’re seeing now. In fact, now’s the perfect time to beef up your crypto portfolio with low-cap, high-upside tokens that are well-positioned to ride the upcoming boom. Snorter Token ($SNORT) is one of the best cryptos to buy now for those looking to ride the explosive growth of the meme coin market. While altcoins continue to dominate crypto discussions, the meme coin segment alone has grown by more than 70% in the past year, proving there’s so much more juice in it than many realize. $SNORT powers the Snorter Bot, a new Telegram-native trading bot designed to level the playing field between institutional players and everyday meme coin traders. How? By allowing retail investors to set buy/sell orders in advance, and then automatically executing them the moment liquidity kicks in. As a result, you’ll finally get the chance to participate in those early meme coin pumps, where life-changing gains are usually made. Security is another standout. Snorter offers protection against a wide range of on-chain threats, including front-running, rug pulls, honeypots, and even advanced sandwich attacks. By buying $SNORT, you’re positioning yourself to ride the adoption of Snorter Bot while unlocking a slew of exclusive benefits along the way: Currently in presale, $SNORT has already pulled in over $3.55M from early investors, with each token available at just $0.1027. Visit Snorter Token’s official website for more information. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) might not have a shiny whitepaper or game-changing technology, but its absurd mission to overthrow Dogecoin as the best meme coin on the planet has already gathered plenty of hype and community support. The project has raised over $1.66M in early investor funding, proving that degen investors are hungry for a wild, rage-fueled meme coin. What’s Maxi Doge, really? Believe it or not, Maxi is Dogecoin’s distant cousin. But the two are anything but close. Dogecoin’s popularity left Maxi in the shadows growing up, as the elder, more ‘wholesome’ Shiba Inu hogged all the limelight at family gatherings. That’s when Maxi found solace in the gym and in front of the charts, where he built big muscles and chased even bigger gains. Now, backed by a fierce community of $MAXI holders who all subscribe to his mantra of ‘never skip leg day, never skip a pump’, the dawg is ready to take the market by storm. Interested? Join the tribe by buying $MAXI at just $0.0002545 apiece. Hurry up, though, because the price will increase in just a few hours. Check out Maxi Doge’s official website for more information. Ethereum ($ETH) has undoubtedly been the talk of the crypto town over the past two weeks, with whales pouring big money into the ‘digital silver.’ For instance, BlackRock recently snapped up more than $314M worth of Ethereum, while Goldman Sachs and Jane Street grabbed a combined 192.5K $ETH. More notably, Thomas Lee, a significant voice in the crypto space, explained that while Wall Street once dismissed Ethereum for being slower than Solana or Sui, institutions are now betting big on it because of its ability to deliver 100% uptime – something non-negotiable for big-money players. ‘If ETH stays above $4,800, we could see a really big cycle,’ Lee added. That prediction looks even stronger when you consider that a massive $4.65B worth of shorts would be liquidated if Ethereum retests its all-time high. Although $ETH has been red all week, the drop isn’t as bad as it looks – because its weekly candle remains within last week’s range. According to the technical playbook, this forms a classic ‘inside candle’ pattern, and a breakout here could trigger an explosive rally. With Ripple’s CEO projecting a nearly tenfold increase in crypto’s valuation by 2030, the stage is set for promising altcoins like $SNORT, $MAXI, and $ETH to shine in the upcoming bull run. That said, kindly bear in mind that crypto investments are highly risky. Also, none of the above is financial advice, and you must always do your own research before investing.

Title: The wine business is in crisis but these whites might be the thing to save it

The wine business is going through something of a crisis at the moment as worldwide consumption maintains a steady downward curve. According to the OIV (International Organisation of Vine and Wine), sales in 2024 are estimated to have been 214.2 million hectolitres – a decrease of 3.3 per cent from 2023. This would be the lowest volume recorded since 1961. According to EU figures, France alone is drinking 65 per cent less than in the 1960s. However, the decrease has been mainly in red wines. Sales of white, rosé and sparkling wines have been steady, even increasing slightly in some years. There is some evidence that growers in traditionally red wine regions such as Bordeaux are ripping up their red vines and planting white instead. Millennials and Gen Z are the key groups here. Instead of sitting down to long dinners accompanied by red wine, they prefer to drink wine by itself or with plates and side dishes. They are aware of the dangers of alcohol, and drink selectively, on special occasions. They prefer organic or sustainable drinks and want to know about the producer. Social media influences drinking patterns and choices. In general the two groups prefer lighter white, or rosé wines with good acidity, plenty of aromas and a bit of texture; wines that will go with the variety of flavours that comes with a mix of small plates and side dishes. They enjoy colourful labels and low-intervention wines. They are also drinking more cocktails, craft beers, low- or no-alcohol drinks, and enjoy ready-to-drink (RTD) and canned cocktails. This week, I present four wines that should appeal to millennials, Gen Z and the rest of us too. This sustainably produced wine is fresh with a vibrant acidity and succulent mouthwatering peach fruits. To drink with fish, creamy chicken and pork dishes. Excellent value for money. Dunnes A light, aromatic and refreshing sauvignon with some nice rich exotic fruits on the palate. Perfect for sipping or with mixed snacks. Wicklow Wine Co, Wicklow; Blackrock Cellar, Blackrock, Co Dublin; Red Island, Skerries, Co Dublin; Morton’s, Dublin 6 Low in alcohol.

Title: High prices expected for New York sapphires

Provenance and rarity are two of the elements that add value to antique jewellery. And, in the forthcoming jewellery auction at Adam’s on September 9th, these will come together, with the sale of two Kashmir sapphires, each set in early 20th-century brooches. Readers of this column may remember how, in May, a rare Kashmir sapphire was sold under the hammer at Adam’s for €550,00 (€660,000 including all fees). At that time the sale made front-page news as it was the highest price paid in Ireland for a gem of its kind. “It was a record-breaking price for a piece of jewellery sold at auction in Ireland and one of the highest prices per carat fetched at auction worldwide in recent years,” says Claire-Laurence Mestrallet, head of jewellery and watches at Adam’s. Kashmir sapphires from the rugged Zanskar range of the Himalayan mountains in Kashmir in northwest India are the rarest and most sought after sapphires in the world. This is partly because the mine in which they originated was completely depleted of the gemstones less than a decade after their discovery in 1881. The rarity of these two brooches now for sale – one with a cushion-shaped sapphire with a double frame of old European single-cut diamonds (estimate €150,000-€250,000), and the other an oval sapphire within a frame of old-cut diamonds (€200,000-€300,000), has been confirmed by two prominent laboratories in Switzerland – the Swiss Gemmological Institute and the Gübelin laboratory. However, it is their provenance that is arguably more interesting. The brooches were gifted to May Emily Sands by her New Yorker parents, Benjamin Aymar Sands and Amy Kirby Akin, upon her marriage to Hugh Melville Howard in September 1908. Howard was the younger son of Fanny Catherine Wingfield and her husband, the sixth earl of Wicklow, whose ancestral seat was Shelton Abbey in Co Wicklow. “The marriage of the daughter of Benjamin Aymar Sands, himself the son of a well-known New York banker, brought together a bond of American society and European aristocracy,” says Mestrallet. The Sands family was one of the original settlers on Long Island and gave their name to Sands Point. The opulence of old-money families and the scenic coastal views in the area are believed to have inspired the fictional East Egg location in F Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby. If aristocratic lineage, or indeed privileged New Yorkers at the turn of the 20th century, isn’t your thing, how the brooches have ended up in a Dublin auction might be. “Hugh died of pneumonia at a young age and May developed psychological problems and was institutionalised. Their two children, Katherine and Cecil, went to live with their uncle, the seventh earl of Wicklow, at Shelton Abbey,” says Mestrallet. And while Cecil Howard returned to live in Manhattan, Katharine Howard remained in Ireland and bought Ounavarra House and farm in Co Wexford. Throughout her life, she contributing to many worthy causes, and the Katharine Howard Foundation was later set up in her memory. She was godmother to the current owner of the brooches, whose name Mestrallet won’t reveal. Meanwhile, Adam’s Blackrock is also hosting an online jewellery auction, which ends on Wednesday, September 10th. An 18-carat gold bracelet made by the Italian brand Marco Bicego is among the exquisite pieces. It is composed of no less than 20 delicate fine-link strands of 18-carat gold, each of which is set with “pebbles” of gold (€3,000-€4,000). And, Morgan O’Driscoll is hosting his first online jewellery auction, which ends on Monday, September 8th. The sale- which have been curated by gemmologist, Colin Weldon, has lots of luxurious earrings, necklaces, bracelets, including the “tutti-frutti’ gem-set bracelet (€40,000-€60,000), with a mix of diamonds and carved and smooth-domed gemstones. The sale also includes a 17th-century enamel diamond and emerald stomacher pendant (€30,000-€40,000). A stomacher is a piece of jewellery that was worn at the centre of the panel in the bodice of a dress. In the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, stomachers became large eye-catching pieces of jewellery worn for formal occasions. Finally, provenance and rarity also come to the fore in the book sale of the entire library of the late Tommy Smith at Purcell’s Auctioneers in Birr, Co Offaly, on September 3rd and 4th. Smith co-owned Grogan’s pub on South William Street, Dublin, very popular with artists and writers. “Tommy befriended many of Ireland’s leading writers and poets and their publications – many of which are signed and dedicated to Tommy – make up a very large proportion of this sale,” says Conor Purcell. He points to Patrick Kavanagh’s Tarry Flynn (Devin Adair, New York, 1949) as one of the most intriguing items for sale, as it is the actual copy used in the infamous libel court case involving Patrick Kavanagh in the 1950s. “During cross-examination, Kavanagh denied that he and Brendan were friends – upon which a copy of Kavanagh’s book Tarry Flynn was given in evidence, with attention drawn to his inside cover inscription: “For Brendan, poet and painter, on the day he decorated my flat, Sunday, 12th, 1950” explains Purcell. The book has an estimate of €3,000-€6,000. adams.ie adamsblackrock.com morganodriscoll.com purcellauctioneers.ie Estimate €500-€1,000 Hammer price €750 Auction house Adam’s Estimate €1,500-€2,500 Hammer price €3,200 Auction house Adam’s Estimate $30,000-$40,000 Hammer price $40,000 (€34,120) Auction house Sotheby’s New York Estimate $2,400-$4,000 Hammer price $2,500 (€3,500) Auction house Sotheby’s New York © 2025 The Irish Times DAC
