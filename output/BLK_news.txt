Title: Renovation of social home in Blackrock cost local council €200,000 to bring back into use

Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council spent more than €200,000 bringing a vacant social home in Blackrock, south Dublin back into use last year. The local authority said it spent €503,142 on “three major refurbishment properties” to re-let in 2024. This included the property in Blackrock, which was built in 1957 and had the same tenant for 63 years. A unit in Glasthule, built in 1934 with the same tenant for 39 years, cost €146,414. The other property was in Dún Laoghaire, constructed in 1932, had same tenant for 49 years, and cost €138,581. “They were all major refurbishments due to the condition of the properties when they were handed back to the council,” a spokeswoman for the council said. “One required an existing extension to be demolished and rebuilt, all required works such as electrical rewiring upgrade works, energy upgrades works, insulation works, external roof works, full new kitchen installations and replastering of internal roofs and walls.” [ Intimidation in a Dublin suburb, and the derelict house being used as stablesOpens in new window ] The Department of Housing and Local Government said it is committed to supporting local authorities implementing an asset management ICT (information and communications technology) system to allow for “strategic and informed planned maintenance work programmes” supported by stock condition surveys. “This approach will ensure that homes are maintained on an ongoing basis and not only maintained at the time of vacancy in some cases after a significant period of time,” it said. “This will result in less works required on re-let, less costs associated and ensure homes are turned around as quick as possible.” The Programme for Government commits to introducing a new voids programme, to implement long-term strategic reforms and mandate local authorities to establish voids frameworks to improve the turnaround of vacant social housing units. However, the department said there is “no set time frame in place” for the new programme. Void is the term given to when tenants vacate houses or flats, either transferring to somewhere more suitable or leaving to purchase their own property. The death of a tenant or a marital breakdown can also result in a void unit. [ Elderly residents of Dublin 8 complex still feel ‘unsafe’ despite installation of security gateOpens in new window ] Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, which covers Blackrock, Dundrum, Dún Laoghaire, Sandyford, Killiney, Shankill and Stillorgan, said it re-tenanted 111 properties last year as part of what it would consider to be “normal re-let processes”. The average cost per property was €31,190. “The length of time a property remains vacant depends on the condition of the property when it is returned to the council and the amount of information required to complete the allocation process,” it added. “Every effort is being made to ensure properties are tenanted as quickly as possible. In 2025, re-let works have been completed on 39 properties to date at an average cost of €17,580.” The council’s average re-let time for vacant properties in 2023 was 23 weeks. Dublin City Council said the average cost of refurbishing void units in 2024 was €44,000. It said when a unit becomes vacant it allows two weeks for tenants to remove any personal belongings, a 10- to 16-week period to revamp the property as well as a two-week period to allow a new tenant to inspect the property and move in. Fingal County Council said it refurbished and brought back into use 79 voids, excluding energy efficiency retrofit works, at a total cost of €1.7 million (or an average of €21,519 per unit). The average re-let period was 33 weeks. South Dublin County Council said it allocated 184 re-let properties at an average turnaround time of 20.64 weeks last year. Taoiseach Micheál Martin hit out at local authorities for the delay in releasing vacated properties to those on waiting lists in the Dáil last month. Mr Martin said local authorities take “too long to release a home that has been vacated”. “It can take sometimes months or a year for the local authority fill the same house again, and they cite all sorts of reasons, and it’s not good enough,” he said. “And now they’re looking for more and more grants to fill those voids.” He said those homes “should be filled fairly quickly, within a week or two of a house being vacated, unless there’s some structural issue” but added that the majority of cases did not involve structural issues.

Title: 100 of the best restaurants, cafes and places to eat in Dublin, Cork, Galway and around Ireland
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/food/2025/05/30/restaurants-cafes-places-to-eat-ireland-guide/

It’s all change in Barna, where chef Nathan Hindmarch has a new diningroom to showcase his talents. With a menu inspired by the elements of land, sea and fire, a new open flame set-up works wonders in dishes such as black sole on the bone or dry-aged rib-eye with ramson capers. Long-serving sommelier Fergal Guiney is always happy to guide you through the wine list. Joanne Cronin With a bright, open room, big windows for people watching and outdoor seating for fine days, Caribou has already established itself as a fun spot in the middle of town for bar food that’s a cut above. Its steak frites with Irish rump steak and peppercorn sauce or double smash burger bring in the weekday lunch crowd, while hearty roast lunches with unlimited gravy fill the seats at weekends. JC Peking duck at China Tang – €88 for a whole duck, ordered in advance – arrives gleaming and is carved tableside by Mr Chan. The skin is brittle and amber – the first bite cracks, melts and disappears. Warm house-made pancakes, dark hoisin, sharp scallions and cool cucumber build the rest. The second course – wok-fried duck with cumin – is darker, crispier, and just as essential. Pricey, yes, but it is one of the best ducks you will eat in Dublin. Corinna Hardgrave [ Great places for sunny outdoor dining around DublinOpens in new window ] Cush recently relocated from the seaside village of Ballycotton to the busy town of Midleton, where Dan Guerin’s cooking remains as sharp and welcoming as ever. A strong focus on locally caught seafood remains at the heart of Cush, with John Dory, roast monkfish and smoked haddock all showcased on the menu. But fear not carnivores, there’s also hearty dry-aged beef chop roasted over charcoal or pork shoulder and mozzarella croquettes. JC A cool Australian coffee vibe in Liscannor. Elaine Slattery’s coffee shop offers a small, well-executed menu with daily baked goods such as brownies, cookies and scones, plus sandwiches made with local ingredients. Headed by coffee expert Richard Mattey, it’s a laid-back spot with a retractable roof, ideal for sunny afternoons or sheltered seating, and an upstairs studio for yoga and Pilates. CH Toulouse out front, La Rochelle in the kitchen – this narrow Ranelagh bistro from Colin Dapot and Sidjy Batista turns out deft French classics. Raclette-stuffed croquettes, pork in mustard sauce with buttery spaetzle, and a fish gratin show up on the short dinner menu from Wednesday to Sunday. By day, it’s a deli for coffee, croissants and charcuterie – with a smart wine list and retail bottles available with €10 corkage. CH Classic French bistro cooking arrived firmly in Dublin to great acclaim, courtesy of industry stalwarts John and Sandy Wyer. Located over M O’Brien’s pub, the L-shaped diningroom is home to a menu packed with Gallic delights. Start with home-made saucisson or seasonally perfect asparagus with cockles followed by chicken au vin jaune or steak frites with pepper sauce. Make sure, though, to leave room for the croissant pudding with Calvados caramel. JC [ ‘People don’t just want dinner – they want an occasion’: Restaurants share their secrets to survivalOpens in new window ] Dublin’s north inner city received a huge boost with the arrival of Joe Smith’s cooking, tucked inside the revitalised Juno pub. The menu is packed with good value downright tasty plates, influenced by Mediterranean flavours. Scoop up smoked cod taramasalata with home-made crisps, crunch through aubergine schnitzel or share a luxurious fish pie for two. Enjoy with one of their excellent cocktails or craft beers. JC Soup hot enough to scald your soul, dumplings fat enough to need a strategy, and French toast that should come with a defibrillator. Hong Kong Wonton is the Pau family’s 16-seater tribute to proper Hong Kong fast food: blisteringly fresh pork and prawn wontons, beef brisket falling apart into spiced broth, and deep-fried peanut butter sandwiches soaked in syrup. It’s a cha chaan teng (Hong Kong diner) drop-kicked into Dublin, serving serious food without apology. CH From former Locks restaurant to new kid on the block, Lena’s transition has been utterly seamless. The old bar is gone, replaced with a sleek new counter, the diningroom is better than ever and the menu is packed with chef Paul McNamara’s unmissable Italian dishes. Sourdough toast with melting lardo, the peppery pici cacio e pepe and the rich veal shin osso bucco will have you coming back for more. JC A Hong Kong native, chef Ben Wong came to Ireland at age 15 and now calls himself a proud Corkman. At Nosh 19, his menu is inspired by Hong Kong cha chaan teng cafe culture, mixing classic Irish-Chinese favourites with authentic Hong Kong and Asian dishes. Recent seafood showcase nights have been a hit, as are dishes like the roast duck noodle soup, Sichuan sour fish and Hong Kong ice milk tea. JC Reggie White could have stayed the guy who fixed everyone else’s pizza. Instead, he built the best one in Dublin – a sharp, low-waste pizzeria set in a reworked redbrick building in Rathmines. Behind a front window rattling with a 1981 Diosna mixer, he’s turning 48-hour fermented Wildfarmed sourdough into blistered, nutty bases topped with whey-braised leeks, Cashel Blue and Andarl Farm sausage. CH Tucked above Conway’s Bar in Blackrock, Sea Shanty is in a creaky-floored room where dinner drifts between anchovies sharpened with ponzu, grilled octopus on smoky muhammara, green curry and oysters straight from Woopstown, Cooley, and Killough Bay and battered seaweed bhajis. Uruguayan chef Sebastian Sainz and Spanish sommelier Elena Segura run the floor like it’s their front room, pouring serious natural wines to match the tide of sardine tins, tacos and tentacles. CH Jalisco and Oaxaca meet in Ranelagh as chefs Victor Lara and Celina Altamirano combine to bring elevated Mexican food to Dublin. Dishes such as Michelada oysters, tostada de ceviche, birria tacos with consommé and incredible charcoal grilled steak would not be out of place in Mexico City itself. It goes without saying that the cocktails made with imported tequila and mezcal are superb. JC The Bucks Head still looks like a Mournes hiking pub from the outside – pint, crisps, dog asleep under the table. Inside, Alex Greene (formerly of Michelin-starred Eipic, Pétrus, Claridge’s), and co-owner Bronagh McCormick are turning out Kilkeel scallops with beurre blanc, black crab and pork ravioli, and a black garlic bread-and-butter pudding that’s worth the drive alone. It’s serious cooking without the ego – a village inn where you can have steak and chips or savour some of the best sauces in Northern Ireland. CH Following a recent hiatus, the Pig’s Ear is back with a menu that is an ode to Irish literature and art. In other hands this would be twee, even touristy, but under owner Stephen McAllister the results are elevated and confident. Indulgent Dublin Lawyer omelette features whiskey flambéed lobster and Béarnaise sauce, holding true to its origin story of being “as rich as a Dublin lawyer”. JC Two restored carriages from the Orient Express, Leona (1927) and Linda (1954), at Glenlo Abbey, set the stage for a dining experience led by Angelo Vagiotis (Terre, Noma, Manresa) and pastry chef Linda Sergidou. The tasting menu combines exceptional technique with creativity: from organic leaves tied in a bouquet to Jerusalem artichoke paired with monkfish liver, and turbot in brioche butter with Champagne sauce. The pastry? Some of the best you’ll find. It’s clear – this is Michelin-level ambition, and one to watch. CH With summer on the way, Two Pups could not have picked a better time to launch its new evening food and wine offering. And while the name may be tongue-in-cheek, there is absolutely nothing pretentious about Adam Kelly’s food. It’s all bang on trend and beautifully executed, ranging from whipped cod’s roe on grilled sourdough and asparagus in Parmesan sauce and guanciale to chunky ham hock croquettes. Oh, and there’s wine now too. JC Vada is a daytime cafe that has livened up Stoneybatter with creative and fun dishes. Chef Hannah O’Donnell maintains a zero-waste philosophy as she serves up breakfast, lunch and weekend brunch. The Vada hash goes a step beyond with Ethersons gammon steak and asparagus, while the croissant French toast is for those with a sweet tooth. Look out for pop-up dinners with natural wines over the summer months. JC The Barrett family of Dunmore House Hotel know more than a thing or two about hospitality. Over the years, they have consistently developed and improved their little piece of heaven overlooking Clonakilty Bay. Under head chef Manuel Canapini, Adrift has become a contender for the country’s top seafood spots – trawler to table. JC It was all change last year at Aniar when owner JP McMahon commissioned architect Aidan Conway to create a new interior for this iconic Galway restaurant. Out went the lighter greens and neutral tones, making way for a darkened interior with dramatic lighting. It makes sense though, acting as a focus for McMahon’s dishes which have evolved into an intense, almost primal, expression of the west of Ireland. JC Baba’de may be the little sibling to Michelin-starred Dede, but this charming spot is standing firmly on its own two feet. Under chef Muslim Karafil, savour fragrant delights such as charcoal grilled chicken thighs with hazelnut satay sauce, spiced crispy chicken with brown butter dip, or a whole west Cork blue lobster with pil pil potato mousseline. Or come for Turkish-influenced brunch on weekends. JC At Ballyfin – a hotel so exclusive it barely seems real – Richard Picard-Edwards has delivered the final flourish: a Michelin star for the diningroom. The €145 eight-course tasting menu is on the familiar side of grandeur, with a thrillingly good Jerusalem artichoke cream topped with chicken jelly and gold leaf, and dishes featuring lobster and caviar. Broths, purées and reductions bring depth without being overwrought. Non-residents can book, but getting a table feels about as casual as applying for citizenship. CH Sam and Emily Moody’s fine-dining spot in Abbeyleix turns out sharp, confident cooking built on serious pedigree – Sam cooked at Ballyfin and Bath Priory – and produce from their own walled garden. The lunch menu and midweek Supper at Six are great value, but it’s at dinner that the kitchen really hits its stride, with a la carte and tasting menus (€80) delivering dishes such as seared scallops, honey-glazed quail with leek emulsion, pan-fried wild halibut with mussels, and slow-roast organic duck. CH The dark wood panelling of Ashford Castle’s George V diningroom might scream old-school but under executive head chef Liam Finnegan the food has taken a fresher turn. French-rooted, yes, but lighter, with sauces built on serious stocks rather than just butter and cream. Much of the produce now comes from a new two-acre kitchen garden, run by head gardener Alex Lavarde using no-dig methods and supplying everything from beets to honey. The twice-baked Hegarty’s cheese soufflé is a must; the wine cellar, as always, is formidable. CH It’s not every day a stonewalled cottage on the wild west coast lands a Michelin star, but Robbie McCauley’s precise cooking makes it feel inevitable. Along with his wife Sophie, he has transformed this former cafe into something rooted in tradition but unmistakably modern, serving a nine-course dinner (€125) and six-course lunch (€85). McCauley works tightly with local producers, using Burren outwintered beef, and lobster and crab from Michael O’Connell, they raise their own chickens and have an impressive vegetable garden. There’s even a small terrace for pre-dinner drinks – if the weather behaves. CH When Bryan Meehan – the Irish entrepreneur behind Blue Bottle Coffee – bought The Park Hotel from the Brennan brothers last year, two things changed in the diningroom. The tasting menu was dropped in favour of a focused a la carte, and Meehan hung two Sean Scully paintings – one of which gives the room its name, The Landline. Local chef James O’Sullivan keeps things classic but special with seared scallops, Kerry Hill lamb, and pan-seared sole. Non-residents can book. CH One of Dublin’s smallest restaurants and one of its mightiest, Liath is an intimate space where food is staged as art. Damien Grey and team perform manoeuvres with grace through service in the fully open kitchen, allowing guests to see the artists at work. Grey is looking to move to a larger space, so make sure to get a booking at Blackrock market before they leave. JC Chef Stevie McCarry recently won the Northern Ireland final of the Great British Menu, a well-earned accolade for this self-taught chef. With wife Rebekah, he has developed Lir into a truly exciting seafood restaurant. The Japanese konro grill is put to good use in the kitchen which turns out cod collar schnitzel, ling kofta with burnt apple sauce and smoked dogfish corndog. Look out for the upcoming summer music nights on the terrace. JC After more than 30 years in business, Denis Cotter is planning his transition away from his legendary fine-dining vegetarian restaurant. Long-term restaurant manager Dave O’Mahony is in line to take over, with head chef Miguel Frutos continuing to lead the kitchen into the future. With produce grown in a unique partnership with Gort na Náin farm and a super natural wine menu, Paradiso continues to set the standard. JC There isn’t another restaurant quite like Rare. Drawing on his classical French training, chef Meeran Manzoor has invented a cuisine that is all his own, using the best of local produce accented with flavours from his home city of Chennai. His menu descriptions may sound simple but they belie a complexity of spice and nuanced technique that is simply delightful. JC Rob Krawczyk and Elaine Fleming’s Michelin-starred Chestnut offers three routes – a €55 two-course prix fixe, a four-course for €75 or the full €120 tasting menu. Ingredients are local and fiercely seasonal – Lisheen Greens, Twomey’s butchers, Union Hall fish – with much of it cooked over a custom wood-fired grill. Expect wild halibut with mussels or aged Skeaghanore duck with coal onion and sour cherries. His food is exacting, mature and restrained – one of the country’s top chefs. CH Sitting in a little glen outside Ballyvaughan, Gregans Castle is the quirky but extremely stylish countryside hotel of dreams. Chef Jonathan Farrell moved from Dublin to take over the kitchens and is producing food perfectly harmonised with the stunning landscapes. Choose from dishes such as wild garlic spaetzle, Atlantic scallop with XO, butter-poached cod, roast rack of Burren lamb or forced rhubarb direct from the hotel garden. JC The Olde Glen bar would have a serious chance in any “Ireland’s most traditional pub” competition, and is worth a visit in its own right. But it’s the cooking of Ciaran Sweeney to the rear of the pub that brings the punters in night after night. The menu is packed with local produce including roast Mulroy Bay scallops, fermented potato bread with Gortahork cabbage and glazed Killybegs cod. JC Former Michelin-star chef Danni Barry keeps things razor sharp at the Owenmore Restaurant, with a four-course table d’hote menu (€95) that lets the ingredients do the talking. Kilkeel scallops with caramelised kohlrabi, line-caught mackerel with blood orange and horseradish, barbecued quail with soy and honey, and wild sea bass with salt-baked celeriac are cooked with precision. Bookings are available for non-residents. CH Five years ago Eunice Power opened her upmarket chipper in Dungarvan, setting a new benchmark for fish and chips by the sea. While the menu offers classic fish suppers, fish burgers and even fish tacos, there’s also chicken and beef burgers, plus a fish spice box for those feeling adventurous. The real standout? Eunice’s commitment to local produce, sourcing from a range of fishing boats in Cork and Waterford whenever possible. CH Morning starts strong with dosa, idli, vada, peserattu and uttappam, hammered out fast and hot with proper chai. By lunch, it’s birianis, thali platters and mutton fry, all packed with heat, spice and serious firepower. The original on Marlborough Street now has a second branch on Abbey Street – newer, just as sharp. The menu runs deep, from Gobi 65 and lamb Chettinadu to rich fish curry, and is built for repeat visits. CH Bart and Nicole Pawlukojc’s cafe runs an all-day brunch on one side of the street, with world flavours drawn from Poland, the Philippines and beyond, punched up by jars of pickles and ferments lined along the high counter. It swings from sharp, umami-rich plates to comforting classics, backed by natural wines and a sharp seasonal menu. Across the road, their bakery draws steady queues for award-winning sourdough, pastries and coffee. CH Dublin’s wine bar scene has exploded, but Bar Pez – Star Wine List Grand Prix winner – sets the standard. Manager Tommy Vivian runs the floor, while the 300+ list focuses on pet-nats, biodynamics and serious growers. Chris McCann (Volpe Nera) leads the kitchen, with Simone Tamilio (Allta) in rotation. Hake ceviche with rhubarb is cold and clean; boudin noir with Coolea rarebit is rich and exact; and scallop toast with plum chilli jam brings real heat. Open Sunday and Monday nights, it’s where chefs and sommeliers go when they’re off the clock. CH Enjoy a little taste of southern comfort cooking down on Cork’s own Bayou. Located in a gorgeous space on MacCurtain Street, start the day with a breakfast of coke and bourbon glazed ham with biscuits, eggs and fried potatoes. For lunch, try the New Orleans classics of po’boys, muffuletta, jambalaya or gumbo, finished with a powdery sweet beignet. In the words of head chef Joshua Crawford, this is non-fussy food, prepared well. JC Bearú in New Ross has a new look – a public square and outdoor seating ready for summer – but the kitchen stays tight. Breakfast and lunch run daily, with pastry from Claire Griffin. Dinner is Friday and Saturday only: a three-course a la carte with hand-rolled gnocchi, Kilmore Quay scallops and Wexford strawberries. Three choices per course, built around whatever the boats and farms bring in that week. CH Don’t be deceived by the apparent simplicity of Feast, the little village restaurant from Melissa McCabe, a former contestant on the Great British Menu, and Roisin McCaffrey. The devil is in the details, from the sleek ceramic coffee cups on wooden coasters to some truly innovative flavour combinations. Try the breakfast sausage roll with peanut butter and chilli jam, toasted sandwiches that pack a punch or an elegant creamy chowder. Feast is just as charming as Rostrevor itself. JC Always buzzing, Takashi Miyazaki‘s bistro and natural wine bar is the place to go for casual Japanese food. The Michelin star has been handed back, but it’s been replaced by fun and a whole lot of hand-pulled noodles. The creativity has never been higher, with plates such as grilled aubergine with red yuzu miso and chicken or udon noodles with white curry topped with creamy potato foam. JC Pillowy flatbreads, creamy hummus and smoky babaganoush are always a good bet at Izz, Alkarajeh and Eman Abu Rabi‘s superb Palestinian cafe. Fill up with manaeesh, a traditional topped flatbread, or swoon over the rich, showstopping magloubeh, a mix of rice, chicken and vegetable served upside down from the pot. Finish with flaky warbat filled with rose water cream and make sure to look out for their first cookbook, Jibrin, this summer. JC Jess and Dave Murphy opened their Galway restaurant in 2011, keeping it casual by day with a revolving lunch menu and shifting to a tighter, more serious dinner service at night. Dishes run to Connemara crab with kohlrabi and roe, lamb with asparagus, and agnolotti del plin stuffed with Connemara surf clams. Their Michelin Green Star reflects a serious commitment to local sourcing and sustainability, built around the circular economy rather than lip service. CH Still one of the best-loved Chinese restaurants in Dublin, this Sichuan stalwart just off O’Connell Street draws Chinese diners first, and everyone else second. Fresh dumplings, green beans with garlic and chilli, glossy aubergine, and deep-fried sea bass show a kitchen that has never lost its edge. Go with a gang – you’ll want to hit the menu properly – and there’s a private room upstairs if you need it. BYOB with €7 corkage keeps the tables packed. CH The little sibling to Good Day Deli, Nádúr occupies a charming small 18th-century building, with seating indoors and outdoors. The ethos here is sustainable plates, coffees and natural wines which celebrate the connection between the food and the natural world. Try Gort na Náin asparagus with burette on sourdough, Goatsbridge smoked trout smørrebrød or the chipotle béchamel and Hegarty’s cheddar toastie. JC Alain Morice runs a 20-seat deli, daytime bistro and wine bar, mixing French technique with Irish produce. The small menu changes weekly, with pâté en croûte – pork, fig and herbs wrapped in pastry – as a regular feature. Galway snails come drenched in garlic butter. Roast chicken with Dauphinoise is straightforward and serious. Desserts are made in-house by Morice’s sister, keeping it all tight and in the family. CH Conor Halpenny cooks with confidence and a sense of fun. Home-made crisps buried under a flurry of cheese, a warm Coolea biscuit with whipped ricotta and walnuts, and lamb mince on toast with cucumber and mint set things off fast. The Square “KFC” and trofie pasta with courgette and Boyne Valley Bán cheese keep the mood lively. Bigger plates follow – slow roast lamb, sirloin steak, monkfish with pickled mussels – backed by a tight, thoughtful wine list. CH St Francis Provisions shines all year around, but with summer on the way, everything truly bursts into life in Kinsale. Chef Rebeca Recarey Sanchez’s plates are deceptive, packed with flavours that are bigger than the cosy little room. Grilled ox tongue, cod with confit peppers or salty gildas, everything is magical, especially when paired with one of their excellent pet-nat wines. JC David O’Halloran and Martin Buckley – better known as “the lads from The Lifeboat” – bought their Courtmacsherry pub in 2017 and became a low-key TikTok sensation documenting the renovation. Now Martin’s cooking videos are getting a following too. The food is sharp but unfussy, with a focus on locally landed fish and seafood through the summer. Prime tables sit across the road with views over the river Arigideen. CH Set in the former O’Brien’s Pub building, which was subsequently home to The Chop House, this is now a serious diningroom with a long counter for walk-ins and a smaller room at the back. The menu sticks to local and seasonal produce – seafood chowder, deep-fried calamari, pan-fried halibut with leek and mussel sauce, duck leg confit with spring onion champ and buttered carrots. There’s also an 18-seat garden terrace – uncovered, unheated, and fully weather dependent. CH When the sun is shining there is no better place to be than outdoors at Fisk with a selection of their original seafood dishes lined up in front of you and a cold drink in hand. Think gochujang glazed trout, buttery brioche roll stuffed with prawn cocktail or spicy Bloody Mary topped with oyster and shrimp. It turns out that chef Tony Davidson is also rather handy with Mexican food too, so dig in. JC A Green Egg barbecue runs hot here, chargrilling vegetables such as asparagus for brunch, served under a heated 80-seat yurt-style tent. Rose O’Toole (formerly of Misunderstood Heron, Aimsir) runs the kitchen, serving up Irish crab and smoked black pudding benedict, Doyle’s sausage brunch burger and house-made sourdough with romesco. The wood-fired oven slow-cooks meats for sandwiches and will fire up again for Grangecon Kitchen pizzas on summer weekends. Sunday pop-ups offer a set menu (€45-€55) built around local produce. CH It’s a bit of a drive to Helen’s Bar, but the reward is a table outside overlooking Kenmare Bay – boats bobbing below, mountains stacked behind. The menu keeps it simple: bowls of mussels, plates of crab claws, fresh fish pulled from the bay and straight on to the plate. Good value, easy-going service and seafood that repays the detour in full. CH Lobster grilled with garlic butter and chips sets the tone here, backed by wild Irish fish and chips, mussels with cream, garlic and white wine and crab claws caught aboard the Atlantic Freedom, served swimming in garlic butter. There’s also wild Irish smoked ling – “smokies” – baked with crème fraîche. A heated terrace with a permanent roof and three beach huts makes outdoor eating possible whatever the weather. CH In Clifden’s former post office, Michael and Hannah Nagle serve a seafood menu that gets straight to the point. Fish and chips (€21), half lobster and chips (€28), mussels with sourdough (€15), and crab claws (€16) are the backbone, while daily specials like mackerel with apple and cucumber (€12) keep things fresh. The live-fire konro grill adds a smoky edge, and outdoor seating with heaters and blankets makes it a great spot, rain or shine. Larger groups can book a two-set menu (€30-€65). CH Diarmuid Ó Mathúna runs one of the best daytime spots around – breakfast, brunch and lunch built on proper seasonal produce. The taco with deep-fried Ros an Mhíl haddock, Aran Islands crab salad with Velvet Cloud yoghurt, and the toastie with Feeney’s pulled bacon collar are all worth the trip. Outside, there’s now a 40-seat garden, half covered, backed by 22 solar panels. They even make their own condiments, from honey mustard mayo to berry compote. CH Casual by day with small plates and sandwiches, more focused at night, William Browne’s Blackrock spot has James Strathern (ex-Dede, Orwell Road, Roe Wines) in the kitchen. There’s a short a la carte and a six-course tasting menu at €64. Cod and nduja arancini, red mullet crudo, wild garlic gnocchi and sausage and ricotta ravioli keep it tight. A sea-view heated deck with 12 uncovered seats makes the most of the setting. DJ nights and summer events are planned. CH Keith Coleman – formerly of Roots, Fumbally and Fia – is behind some of the best casual food in Dublin. The evening menu runs Thursday to Saturday: roast Iona Farm carrots with labneh and chermoula, cauliflower with smoky cashew sauce, free-range chicken thigh with tzatziki and hot honey. The sheltered 42-seat garden, planted and properly thought through, is one of the best places in the city to sit and eat when the weather behaves. A new bakery and test kitchen are on the way later this year. CH In a restored 1820s coach house, Ciaran Kiely (ex-Oliveto) is cooking over a bespoke ember pit, working with Ballincarey Organic Farm, An Tairseach and Higgins butchers. The menu runs from Sheelagh’s beetroot with St Tola’s goat’s cheese to Kilmore Quay monkfish, pork belly, and a Wagyu cheeseburger that means business. Outside, a 40-seat terrace – half covered, marble tables, wood stove and heaters – makes outdoor eating worth a gamble. Thursday nights run a two- or three-course neighbourhood menu. CH Situated on Cork’s historic Cornmarket, David Devereaux and Anne Zagar’s small restaurant has become known in the city for exacting classic cooking executed with local ingredients on a seasonal menu that changes weekly. Start with Anne’s home-made brown bread and burned onion butter, followed by unctuous duck liver parfait with spring Cork asparagus, anchovy and crispy egg followed by monkfish grilled on the bone finished with ‘nduja cream. JC Bastible continues to stand proud on Dublin’s Leonard’s Corner, serving its unique Irish take on Nordic-style cuisine. Under owner Barry Fitzgerald and chef Killian Walsh, the clean, crisp cooking is sprinkled with rich notes. Think crab tartlet with fermented sweetcorn and tart grape juice, grilled sika deer with the glossiest port jus or a creamy mushroom custard made with mushrooms grown right across the road. JC When most Michelin-starred places are heading for three figures before you’ve ordered a drink, this one still turns out three courses at lunch and early-bird for €50. Garrett Byrne’s food is rooted in the classics – ravioli of hand-dived scallop with fennel butter sauce, pancetta royale of Challans duck with spiced greengage purée, grilled octopus with braised chickpeas, Hereford beef with ox cheek croquette and green peppercorn salsa. Great ingredients, great cooking, great value. CH You don’t expect one of the country’s best set menus to come out of a 15th-century building in Waterford, but Peter Everett cooks with precision and care. Lunch is €38, pre-theatre €41, dinner €55 – for proper dishes like soft-boiled free-range egg with toasted brioche and cheese and onion cream, Wexford scallops with lentils and garlic sausage, and fillet of hake with smoked bacon, cabbage and potato. Eight outdoor seats sit under an awning, with heaters primed for Irish summers. CH At Lignum, Danny Africano leads a kitchen where every plate passes over kiln-dried birch, ash and oak, threading smoke through some of the country’s most precise cooking, while his wife, Molly Keane, runs front of house. The €145, 10-course tasting menu has included Killary Fjord mussel and sea urchin flan, red mullet and gambero rosso pasta, and wild venison just barely kissed by flame. A €70 five-course lunch runs at weekends. The Michelin star finally landed in 2025 – three years later than it should have. CH Big windows flood Ox with light, but the real draw is Stephen Toman’s cooking – precise, inventive, and rooted in the seasons. Refurbished in 2023, the calm, understated room sets the stage for a kitchen quietly recognised as one of the sharpest on the island. Expect dishes like smoked Ballywalter veal with black garlic, or lobster brightened with broad beans and lemon grass, while Alain Kerloc’h’s smart wine pairings pull it all together. CH In case the name hasn’t already given the game away, a parrilla grill sits at the heart of this Ranelagh restaurant. From restaurateur Jules Mak and head chef Hector Ochoa, charcoal flavour is infused into as many dishes as possible, from grilled half chicken in arbol and habanero sauce to caramelised pineapple with pickled onion and tangy tajin. The margarita menu is absolutely banging, especially the Verdita. JC Fidelity Studio connects to Fidelity Bar through a slick interior door, making it easy to move between beers and bao. Sister 7 – a Big Fan collaboration – serves Chinese-style tapas using Irish produce and ingredients repurposed from Whiplash Beer’s brewing waste. The dumplings and bao are solid, but the “lip sticks” – fried cakes of fermented rice, yam, tofu and celeriac – are the move. Don’t miss the Sichuan-style Irish lamb with cumin, chilli, sesame and curried chickpea popcorn. DJs keep the place buzzing. CH Laser sharp classical cooking, intense glossy sauces and innovative flavours all combined this year to land a first Michelin Star for the beautiful Morrison Room. It has been achieved under the leadership of local man Adam Nevin, who learned his craft at spots such as The Hand and Flowers in Buckinghamshire and The Grill at the Dorchester in London. Expect much, much more from this modest, immensely talented chef. JC When Gwen McGrath and Ken Doherty recently announced the reopening of Dublin’s smallest restaurant, there was much rejoicing. This time out they accept bookings, much to the relief of those who struggled to get tables before, and there’s also wine to accompany lunch. Small sharing plates of smoky aubergine, calf’s liver with fenugreek butter, and radicchio dressed with guanciale fat epitomise the eclectic Italian influence for which this cosy spot is much loved. JC Mickael Viljanen’s Chapter One isn’t just Ireland’s best restaurant – it’s one of the best anywhere, and not just for the two-Michelin-star, €90 three-course lunch. At a recent meal, a parade of canapés (warm mushroom beignet, pissaladière hidden in transparent pastry) was followed with Loire Valley asparagus, wild turbot, Anjou pigeon and razor-sharp desserts. Bookings open quarterly – next round June 24th at 9.30am for September–October. Tables for two go first; fours have more chance. Get on the waiting list now and sign up for the newsletter. CH Peter Hogan and Jumoke Akintola have stripped things back at their Victorian town house seafood spot in Tramore, now running a casual Fish & Chips Café on the ground floor. Light beer-battered fish – John Dory, haddock, whiting – leads the menu, backed by daily specials like Woodstown Bay oysters, Boatstrand crab salad and Roaring Water Bay mussel curry. It operates as a diningroom from Friday to Sunday. The wine list is as impressive as ever, and organic and biodynamic wines are poured by the glass, bottle or carafe. CH There are dishes at Goldie that make you want to eat nothing but seafood for the rest of your life. Aisling Moore’s creativity seems to know no bounds, creating pâté made from local meaty Rossmore oysters, Mexican-inspired pibil monk cheek sope or pan-fried megrim with cafe de Paris butter. There are generous mounds of crushed colcannon for sides and a modern wine selection available by the glass, carafe or bottle. JC Grano is one of Dublin’s hardest reservations to secure, but it’s worth it if you want pasta excellence. All pasta is made fresh every day, using flour from an ancient Italian grain grown by owner Roberto Mungo himself. New additions to the menu include cappellacci stuffed with slow-cooked beef and onion, romanesco artichoke ravioli, and spaghetti with asparagus, saltwort and Calabrian chilli breadcrumbs. Ask for recommendations from the all-Italian wine list. JC When a meal starts with a chunk of potato focaccia, carbonara butter and guanciale, you might justifiably feel that you’re in good hands. At Kicky’s, chef Eric Matthews and team will take you through a spectrum from refined to indulgent. Think mussels bound lightly in taramasalata with smoked eel and kohlrabi, wild brill cooked over charcoal or rabbit Bolognese. Make sure to finish with Audrey Cahatol’s signature Irish Coffee dessert. JC Kevin Burke’s restaurant is one of Dublin’s toughest reservations, and for good reason. The room fizzes with energy and the food is smart, focused and inventive. The choux with horseradish and Cantabrian anchovy has been there since day one. Small plates include marinated peppers with salsa verde and kohlrabi, followed by a tranche of turbot with jus gras, sorrel and Béarnaise. The wine list, put together by ace sommelier and restaurant manager Ann-Marie Duignam, is just as sharp. Book via their website – and if only 5pm shows, email for cancellations. CH Variety Jones has finally settled into its new home at the junction of Thomas Street and Francis Street. The attractive high windows allow passersby to gaze in at the kitchen and chef Keelan Higgs at the pass. This is exactly what a neighbourhood Michelin restaurant should be, with a tasting menu that combines comfort and fine dining. The old premises a few doors down will reopen soon as a wine bar. JC Always evolving, Niall Davidson’s allta is returning to a tasting menu format for lunchtime and dinner which is designed to showcase the restaurant’s journey over the years from Library Place, Setanta Street and now the Dublin docklands. With an unwavering commitment to Irish produce in the main restaurant and the buzzy allta bar, the punchy wood-fired cooking is well worth the trip. JC Ever since reopening, Coppinger has captured the buzzy and fun vibes of the original venue. Listen to the cocktails shaking while you browse the Mediterranean-inspired menu which uses the best of Irish ingredients over a barbecue grill. Everything is delicious, especially when it’s the incredible value “menú del día,” available Wednesday-Friday, which offers two courses for €15 or three for €20. Where else would you get it? JC Small plates, bigger tables, better chairs – Daróg in Galway has sharpened up without losing its edge. The cooking leans into smoke and charcoal, from grilled white asparagus with lovage hollandaise to dry-aged lamb with confit leek and swede. There’s a five-course tasting menu at €55, or you can build your own from the blackboard, where more than 40 wines by the glass change weekly. Run by Zsolt Lukács and Edel McMahon, with Attila Galambos on fire in the kitchen. CH There are two main features to the diningroom at Elbow Lane, the open charcoal grill right in the middle, and the stainless steel microbrewery tanks to the rear. Put simply, it’s all about the grilling and the beer here, although the cocktails are pretty damn good also. Start with the intensely flavoured pork belly with fish sauce caramel, followed by the signature slow-smoked baby back ribs or wood-grilled steaks. JC Flame-finished mains hold their own at this neighbourhood spot. Andarl Farm pork belly, crisped and tender, pairs with radicchio and hazelnuts, while monkfish is perfectly charred. For €29, the prix fixe (5–6pm Wed–Fri) offers a snack, main, and glass of wine – perfect pre-cinema. Otherwise, settle in for grilled lamb or free-range chicken, all cooked over live fire. CH At Mister S, they proudly state that all mains are cooked over charcoal and wood. But, to be honest, every piece of produce that enters the kitchen is in danger of finding itself over the glowing embers. The smell of smoke permeates the entire room and everything is delicious, from charred leeks with romesco and smoked mozzarella, to piri piri chicken, or their incredible beef sourced from Co Donegal. Everything gets a turn on the embers. JC Cooked over live fire on an Ox grill – tomahawk steaks, Black Angus chateaubriand, and porterhouse steaks are the stars, with pizzas from a full pizza oven and flatbreads to round it out. The recently renovated “secret garden” provides a relaxed outdoor setting. Set menus (€34.50 for two courses, €39.50 for three) make it easy to dive into fire-cooked flavours, while a revamped cocktail bar adds a finishing touch. CH The tomahawk for two (€79) is the headline at The Fern Grill – a slab of Hereford beef, carved at the table and kissed hard by the Basque Josper grill. Seamus Commons fires Black Angus, lamb and daily fish with the same precision, but nothing matches the depth and smoke of the beef. CH Flavour is at the heart of everything that chef patron Brian Murray does. Under Darren Kennedy, the kitchen turns out smoke-kissed plates built for sharing, using local seasonal ingredients. The signature milk buns with cultured butter are mandatory, then try grilled cuttlefish with leeks and smoked aioli, or lamb saddle and belly with smoked carrots. A second live-fire restaurant, Birdsong, is coming soon to the Coal Quay. JC Denis Vaughan runs this newly refurbished spot on the prom, firing meat and shellfish over a Spanish Josper to exacting effect. The menu is tight and fire-driven: barbecued Aran Island monkfish with a hazelnut crust, roasted chicken supreme with satay crust and fregola, and aged Irish Black Angus steaks with bone marrow butter, beef jus and dripping chips. It’s about proper fire cooking, heavy plates and the freshest fish he can lay his hands on. CH Walking from the busy Dublin quays into the diningroom at Achara, gently fragranced with the smell of grilled meats, is like being briefly transported far away. Chef Graeme Reynolds pulls no punches, delivering authentic Thai flavours such as chicken wings in fish sauce caramel, Wagyu basil chilli beef krapao and XO mushroom larb. Check out the €15 weekday lunch menu for some of the best value in town. JC Diningroom in Castlebar has been quietly serving one of the best-value prix fixe menus in the country since 2016. €42 or €59 gets you three courses and a sorbet – brown soda bread, scallops with Kelly’s black pudding, Hereford sirloin with gratin dauphinoise, and a sticky toffee pudding that justifies the drive. Service is calm, the room is dark wood and Prussian blue, and every plate feels thoroughly composed. CH The mark of a great wine bar is shown in how they share their enthusiasm for wine with their customers, and the charming L’Atitude 51 leads the way when it comes to a calendar packed with wine tastings and food and wine pairing events. The food menu is designed for sharing, with simplicity and quality shining through. Try Macroom burrata with olive oil, radishes with anchoïade or haddock and mussel croquettes, and of course, some magnificent wines. JC In a bustling neighbourhood, this spot still delivers a solid early evening menu – two/three courses for €42/€52 – proving that early bird doesn’t have to be bland. David O’Byrne, with his Michelin Bib Gourmand since 2018, keeps the menu fresh with creative dishes like grilled sea bass with orange and kohlrabi or pan-seared halibut with fennel, shellfish, and chorizo barley broth. A five-course tasting menu is also available on the first Tuesday of each month for €72. CH [ This just might be the best-value restaurant menu in the countryOpens in new window ] It’s all systems go in Dingle for the Flannery family who have increased the number of seats at The Fish Box as well as moving the takeaway to Paddy Bawn Brosnan’s. New this summer is Fish Outside of the Box, offering lobster, crab and prawn rolls along with cocktails, wine and beer. With fish direct from their own fishing vessel and commitment to a sustainable supply chain, it’s among the country’s top seafood spots. JC Darren D’Arcy always has a perfect bottle of wine on hand to match the dishes that flow from Barry Sun’s kitchen. It’s no easy task, given Barry’s broad range of skill and flavours. Think Flaggy Shore oysters with a dab of home-made chilli oil, his signature mushroom dumplings, BBQ brill for two or a classic rum baba with strawberries. It’s worth noting that the evening neighbourhood menu offers seriously good value. JC After 20 years in business, Dax still oozes quiet class. Graham Neville’s superb classical cooking is a joy – seared Castletownbere scallops with coral bisque, Tipperary beef, and a mille-feuille of Irish rhubarb are textbook examples. Owner Olivier Meisonnave has compiled one of the country’s great wine lists – from smart biodynamic finds to serious Grand Cru. CH Since opening, Killian Durkin and Jess D’Arcy have worked tirelessly to deliver wonderful hospitality and modern Irish cooking from their seaside restaurant. Killian uses local and Irish ingredients such as “lamb lobster” (lamb neck), Winetavern Farm pork and Howth honey to great effect. Don’t miss the iconic cod chip or their exquisite tarts. JC Recently refurbished, mrDeanes is a bistro-style restaurant that encapsulates the very best of chef Michael Deane’s 28 years in business, and this year received a Michelin Bib Gourmand. It’s exactly what a busy city bistro should be, serving up Portavogie crab on toast, entrecôte au poivre, sugar pit pork chops and fish and chips. Look out for their new own label white wine. JC Ruchii is a riot of Indian flavours and bright jewelled colours. Marinated jumbo prawns are cooked to perfection in the tandoor oven while the slow-cooked lamb shank nalli nihari is sheer warmth. Chef Sateesh Sayana also serves up authentic South Indian specialities including rava dosa, masala uttapam and a Sunday special of Hyderabadi chicken dum biryani. Read our full review here. JC John Coffey does not stand still but continues to develop, always cooking with flair. The focus here is on quality produce, resulting in a glossy golden pithivier of potato, onion and Mossfield cheddar; roast cod with cauliflower, capers and golden raisins or a dark chocolate and sesame ganache. JC The words “Asian fusion” can sometimes strike fear, but diners are in safe hands at Umi. Owners Seán Lafferty and Gary Moran have created a fun atmosphere that seamlessly marries great Irish produce with Japanese techniques. Think binchotan grilled steak or crispy dumplings made with local pork and a fiery rayu sauce. They even offer their own wine, a fresh Austrian Blaufränkisch made by ex-employee Jack Mcateer.

Title: As Elon Musk Exits Washington, Tesla Investors Demand He Work 40-Hour Weeks as CEO

Now that Elon Musk has wrapped up his high-profile advisory role in Washington, a group of Tesla’s institutional investors is pressing him to return his full attention to the company, which has seen sales plummet in key markets in recent months. The investors point to slowing electric vehicle sales and a slumping stock price as evidence that Tesla needs Musk back at the helm. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. Yesterday (May 28), Tesla chair Robyn Denholm received a letter signed by 12 major pension funds that collectively hold significant stakes in the company. As first reported by the Financial Times, the letter calls on Musk to commit to working at least 40 hours per week at Tesla. The signatories include New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, Oregon State Treasurer Elizabeth Steiner, the American Federation of Teachers, Denmark’s AkademikerPension, and the SOC Investment Group, which collaborates with labor union pension funds to back shareholder initiatives. SOC is the investment arm of the Strategic Organizing Center, a coalition of North American labor unions. “The current crisis at Tesla puts into sharp focus the long-term problems at the company stemming from the CEO’s absence, which is amplified by a Board that appears largely uninterested and unwilling to act in the best interest of all Tesla shareholders by demanding Musk’s full-time attention on Tesla,” the letter said. The investors’ letter arrives as Tesla’s board reportedly weighs a new compensation plan for Musk, after a Delaware court struck down his controversial $56 billion pay package in 2023. The pension funds argue that any new agreement should come with a condition that that Musk commit to working at least 40 hours a week at Tesla. “Given Musk’s leadership roles at four private companies and his foundation, the Board must ensure that Tesla is not treated as just one among many competing obligations,” the letter said. Aside from Tesla, he partially owns and runs at least five other companies, including SpaceX, X, The Boring Company, Neuralink and xAI. Musk recently promised to refocus on Tesla and scale back his role as the head of the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). “Back to spending 24/7 at work and sleeping in conference/server/factory rooms. I must be super focused on X/xAI and Tesla . . . as we have critical technologies rolling out,” he wrote on X earlier this month. Musk is the largest shareholder of Tesla, owning about 13 percent of the company. Its other major shareholders include institutional funds such as Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street. Because Tesla is part of the S&P 500 index (since December 2020), many pension funds that invest in index funds also own shares in Tesla. The signatories of this week’s letter collectively hold about 0.25 percent of Tesla, worth roughly $3 billion. We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Title: Ethereum ETF inflows hit $71M – Could $2,900 be ETH’s next target?

ETH also leads in stablecoin growth, showing institutional confidence. Ethereum [ETH] is staging a quiet comeback. After months of capital outflows and narrative drift, ETH is once again drawing investor attention; this time with institutional weight behind it. ETH is regaining dominance with $71.3 million in recent ETF inflows, a spike in bridged net flows, and stablecoin supply growth. As capital rotates back into the network, signs suggest institutional accumulation, coinciding with shifting broader market dynamics. Source: X BlackRock alone accounted for $32.5 million, showing its position as a frontrunner in institutional ETH accumulation. The ETHA and FETH-led inflows reflect strong confidence from major asset managers as capital rotates back into Ethereum. This positive shift follows net positive flows in the third week of May, despite earlier volatility from outflows by Fidelity and Franklin. Source: Artemis Recent Artemis data reveals that Ethereum outperformed all networks in bridged net flows and stablecoin supply growth. Ethereum recorded the largest net inflow of assets across bridges alongside a sharp increase in stablecoin issuance, signaling renewed liquidity and capital confidence. This dual lead suggests rising usage and demand across DeFi protocols, reinforcing Ethereum’s position as crypto’s foundational Layer 1. Ethereum traded at around $2,708 at press time, approaching recent local highs with bullish momentum. The RSI climbed to 70.47, at the edge of overbought territory, showing strong buying pressure, but also the potential for short-term consolidation. CMF remained positive at 0.15, indicating steady capital inflows. Source: TradingView If ETH closes above $2,720 with sustained volume, a breakout toward $2,900 becomes plausible. However, one must watch for signs of fatigue as the RSI nears critical levels. For now, the trend remains bullish, but overextension risks a short-term pullback or ranging pause.

Title: Bitcoin low volatility fuels BlackRock’s IBIT 31-day inflow run and $72B asset surge

BlackRock’s IBIT establishes dominance in ETF market, ranks top five by year-to-date inflows. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has attracted consistent capital for over a month, signaling sustained institutional interest in the top crypto. According to data from SoSoValue, IBIT has recorded 31 consecutive trading days without net outflows since April 14. The only exception was May 13, when flows remained flat. Despite that pause, the ETF has received $9.31 billion in net inflows during the ongoing streak, which has propelled the fund’s assets under management to roughly $72 billion. ETF Store President Nate Geraci pointed out that IBIT now ranks among the top five ETFs by year-to-date inflows across a universe of more than 4,200 US-listed funds. Market observers point to declining volatility and improving market sentiment as key drivers behind IBIT’s appeal. Bloomberg ETF strategist Eric Balchunas noted that the fund’s 90-day rolling volatility has reached its lowest level since inception. This trend, paired with Bitcoin’s steady price gains, is drawing in larger asset allocators. Balchunas highlighted that IBIT’s flow dominance in recent weeks significantly outpaces other crypto-related ETFs, suggesting it has become the go-to choice for institutional players seeking Bitcoin exposure without excessive risk. Investment manager Mike Shell of ASYMMETRY added that IBIT is beginning to behave more like a mature, institutional-grade asset. According to him, the asset is not acting like a speculative crypto token but more like a digital store of value, like gold, than volatile tech stocks. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential. He imparts insights on a range of topics like DeFi, hacks, mining and culture, underlining transformative power.

Title: The Ivy Web
From Prestige to Treason, the Global Unraveling of Academic Empire

Skip to comments. Posted on 05/29/2025 1:47:33 PM PDT by bitt Wilted Ivy elucidated the high-level connections between academia and the Deep State. The Harvard Control Grid showed their framework of control. Now … lets see the Ivy Web. The End of Illusion Begins in Cambridge For over a century, Harvard University sat at the center of the Western world’s intellectual web - an elite fortress cloaked in prestige, draped in crimson, and entrusted with shaping presidents, policy, and public trust. But that trust was built on illusion. The recent cascade of revelations, liquidations, and criminal convictions has exposed something far darker: Harvard was never just a school. It was a global command node - a soft power empire cloaked in academia, now caught in a storm of treason, foreign subversion, and ethical collapse. From hosting sanctioned Chinese military-linked officials, to funding research in Wuhan through convicted felons, to concealing billions in foreign funds, Harvard’s once-pristine image has collapsed under the weight of its own deception. The dominoes are still falling. Financial Desperation - The Billion-Dollar Fire Sale As reported in Wilted Ivy, Harvard began selling off more than $1 billion in illiquid private equity holdings - not to rebalance its endowment, but to stay afloat. According to public filings and insider leaks, the Harvard Management Company (HMC) was offloading stakes in vehicles managed by Blackstone, KKR, and Bain Capital. This wasn’t a strategy shift. It was distress liquidation. Business Insider reported in January 2024 that Harvard’s liquidation was mirrored by major institutional partners, including Goldman Sachs and even BlackRock itself. These were not isolated decisions. They were a coordinated exit, a sign that something massive had shifted in the financial and ideological infrastructure beneath the Ivy League. This collapse traces back to Executive Orders 13818 and 13848, signed by President Trump in 2017 and 2018 respectively, creating the legal framework for the seizure of assets connected to corruption, election interference, and foreign subversion. These weren’t symbolic gestures.

CAMBRIDGE, MA — With the Trump administration banning Harvard University from taking international students, the school was forced to begin accepting students from Ohio. “I can’t believe I’m doing this,” said Harvard Dean of Admissions Phil Donahue. “I never thought we would fall so far. I’ve spent my entire life trying to never even speak to someone from Ohio, much less allow them into Harvard. This is rock bottom.” With international students unable to attend and hundreds of admissions slots to fill, the University began considering what was once unthinkable: allowing human beings from the Midwest on campus. “Maybe we can let someone from Illinois in. Do they speak English there? I’m not familiar,” said Don Harmon, Vice Dean of Admissions. “I suppose these students will want to bring their chickens and hay to the dorm, I believe that’s what these people like. Appalling. This feels like inviting baboons to a royal wedding.” Despite its best efforts, Harvard remained unable to fill its final slots and ultimately made the difficult decision to begin accepting students from Ohio. “We have to face reality. We have to face Ohio,” said Donahue. “After centuries of keeping Harvard Ohio-less, today we are mailing our first acceptance letters to Columbus. I’m literally throwing up in my mouth saying it.” At publishing time, the students in Ohio had laughed heartily for hours at the idea that any of them would ever want to go to Harvard over Ohio State. 11 posted on 05/30/2025 3:38:17 AM PDT by UMCRevMom@aol.com (Please pray for God 's intervention to stop Putin's invasion of Ukraine 🇺🇸) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 10 | View Replies] To: UMCRevMom@aol.com human beings from the Midwest The author is getting ahead of its beeing here. 12 posted on 05/30/2025 4:54:49 AM PDT by AndyJackson [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 11 | View Replies] Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

But that trust was built on illusion. The recent cascade of revelations, liquidations, and criminal convictions has exposed something far darker: Harvard was never just a school. It was a global command node - a soft power empire cloaked in academia, now caught in a storm of treason, foreign subversion, and ethical collapse. From hosting sanctioned Chinese military-linked officials, to funding research in Wuhan through convicted felons, to concealing billions in foreign funds, Harvard’s once-pristine image has collapsed under the weight of its own deception. The dominoes are still falling. Financial Desperation - The Billion-Dollar Fire Sale As reported in Wilted Ivy, Harvard began selling off more than $1 billion in illiquid private equity holdings - not to rebalance its endowment, but to stay afloat. According to public filings and insider leaks, the Harvard Management Company (HMC) was offloading stakes in vehicles managed by Blackstone, KKR, and Bain Capital. This wasn’t a strategy shift. It was distress liquidation. Business Insider reported in January 2024 that Harvard’s liquidation was mirrored by major institutional partners, including Goldman Sachs and even BlackRock itself. These were not isolated decisions. They were a coordinated exit, a sign that something massive had shifted in the financial and ideological infrastructure beneath the Ivy League. This collapse traces back to Executive Orders 13818 and 13848, signed by President Trump in 2017 and 2018 respectively, creating the legal framework for the seizure of assets connected to corruption, election interference, and foreign subversion. These weren’t symbolic gestures.

CAMBRIDGE, MA — With the Trump administration banning Harvard University from taking international students, the school was forced to begin accepting students from Ohio. “I can’t believe I’m doing this,” said Harvard Dean of Admissions Phil Donahue. “I never thought we would fall so far. I’ve spent my entire life trying to never even speak to someone from Ohio, much less allow them into Harvard. This is rock bottom.” With international students unable to attend and hundreds of admissions slots to fill, the University began considering what was once unthinkable: allowing human beings from the Midwest on campus. “Maybe we can let someone from Illinois in. Do they speak English there? I’m not familiar,” said Don Harmon, Vice Dean of Admissions. “I suppose these students will want to bring their chickens and hay to the dorm, I believe that’s what these people like. Appalling. This feels like inviting baboons to a royal wedding.” Despite its best efforts, Harvard remained unable to fill its final slots and ultimately made the difficult decision to begin accepting students from Ohio. “We have to face reality. We have to face Ohio,” said Donahue. “After centuries of keeping Harvard Ohio-less, today we are mailing our first acceptance letters to Columbus. I’m literally throwing up in my mouth saying it.” At publishing time, the students in Ohio had laughed heartily for hours at the idea that any of them would ever want to go to Harvard over Ohio State. 11 posted on 05/30/2025 3:38:17 AM PDT by UMCRevMom@aol.com (Please pray for God 's intervention to stop Putin's invasion of Ukraine 🇺🇸) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 10 | View Replies] To: UMCRevMom@aol.com human beings from the Midwest The author is getting ahead of its beeing here. 12 posted on 05/30/2025 4:54:49 AM PDT by AndyJackson [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 11 | View Replies] Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

Title: How Athletes Are Fueling Bitcoin’s Push Into The Mainstream

ByBecca Bratcher ByBecca Bratcher, Contributor. Tristan Thompson #13 of the Cleveland Cavaliers drives against Duncan Robinson during the fourth ... More quarter in Game Four of the Eastern Conference First Round NBA Playoffs on April 28, 2025. (Photo by Megan Briggs) A growing number of professional athletes are becoming vocal advocates of Bitcoin and digital assets. What started as a trickle of interest is becoming a wave, as players from the NBA, NFL, and beyond use their influence and capital to help push decentralized finance into the mainstream. Cleveland Cavalier Tristan Thompson joined in that conversation during the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, hosting over 30,000 attendees. In an interview with Forbes, Thompson reflected on his journey into Bitcoin, his views on the broader crypto ecosystem, and why he sees financial independence as a new form of empowerment for athletes and their communities. Thompson was first introduced to Bitcoin in 2015, but the concept didn’t immediately resonate. It wasn’t until 2020, when more of his peers began investing and institutional interest started growing, that he began to take a closer look. Conversations with financial professionals sparked his curiosity, but major firms were still hesitant to enter the space at the time. As BlackRock and others eventually moved into digital assets, Thompson saw Bitcoin not as a passing trend but as a meaningful shift in how value and ownership could be structured. What ultimately drew him in was not just the market potential but also the philosophy of a decentralized system that gives people greater control over their financial lives. In a space known for its tribalistic culture, Thompson views digital assets with a more inclusive outlook. Using a sports analogy, he said, “Bitcoin is like Michael Jordan. Ethereum? That’s LeBron. Then you’ve got Steph Curry, we’ll say he’s Solana. You need all of them to evolve the game,” he said. “It’s a team sport.” Still, when newcomers ask where to start, he points them straight to Bitcoin. “It’s the original. You start there, then educate yourself from there.” His broader goal of participating in the digital asset ecosystem reflects a mindset gaining traction among athletes. One focused less on short-term speculation and more on building lasting financial independence. That includes helping everyday workers, including those around him in sports arenas, understand how tools like Bitcoin can offer a path to greater control over their financial futures. Thompson isn’t the only athlete investing in Bitcoin and digital assets as a path toward building wealth. NFL running back Saquon Barkley made headlines in 2021 when he announced he would convert all of his endorsement income into Bitcoin using the payment platform Strike. “We’re seeing inflation and learning you can’t just save yourself to wealth,” Barkley said on Anthony Pompliano’s podcast. “That’s why I’m taking my marketing money in Bitcoin.” His reasoning echoed Thompson’s focus on long-term value in an unpredictable economic climate. Barkley emphasized that building generational wealth requires more than a player’s salary, especially in high-risk positions where injuries can abruptly alter a career. After tearing his ACL in 2020, Barkley saw firsthand how fleeting a football career can be. His pivot to Bitcoin was both a hedge and a statement of belief. Former NFL lineman Russell Okung is widely recognized as the first athlete to receive part of his salary in Bitcoin. In 2019, he famously posted on X, formerly Twitter, “Pay me in Bitcoin.” Today, Okung sees Bitcoin as a tool to solve deeper societal issues. “The next phase of Bitcoin,” he said, is “about solving real problems.” That philosophy underscores a shift among the most committed athlete advocates of Bitcoin. It’s no longer just about digital gold or speculative upside. It’s about freedom, infrastructure, and access. Especially in communities historically excluded from legacy financial systems. What sets athletes apart isn’t just their wealth. It’s their visibility and influence, especially among tech-savvy audiences. Thompson believes athletes are uniquely positioned to influence public conversations, given their platforms and visibility. Rather than positioning himself as an expert, he sees his role as helping others explore a different way to think about money and financial independence through tools like Bitcoin. Companies like Coinbase, Strike, and Cash App have used high-profile athlete sponsorships to build credibility and adoption. Bitcoin remains at the center of many athletes’ strategies. Not just for its scarcity, but for what it represents. For many professional athletes, Bitcoin serves as a foundation for building financial security. Thompson sees the space as a chance to promote education and empower others to take control of their financial futures. Rather than chasing quick profits, he encourages a mindset focused on ownership, resilience, and informed decision-making. He aims to make digital assets more approachable for those who may feel excluded from traditional finance. Whether it's helping others gain confidence with money or encouraging someone to rethink outdated financial strategies, he hopes to inspire a more self-reliant approach to wealth. The market has shown renewed momentum, with Bitcoin now trading just under $107,000. But the motivations of these athlete advocates go beyond price. Digital assets can represent a philosophical and practical shift in how wealth is preserved, shared, and grown. From Tristan Thompson to Saquon Barkley, a generation of athletes is taking a broader role in the financial world. They are not simply promoting digital assets but actively helping shape a future prioritizing openness, resilience, and inclusion. Thompson believes that while investing in Bitcoin may not be for everyone, understanding how money works is essential. In his view, financial literacy is a key step toward personal empowerment.

IBIT, which received regulatory approval in January 2024, generated nearly $500 million in investments on Wednesday and has received net inflows every day this month except one, according to data from U.K. asset manager Farside Investors. “[It's] starting to get ridiculous,” quipped Nate Geraci, president of investment advisor ETF Store, in a tweet Thursday. Another nearly *$500mil* into iShares Bitcoin ETF… Starting to get ridiculous. Inflows 30 of past 31 days. Nearly $9.5bil in new $$$. IBIT comfortably in top 5 ETFs by inflows this year (out of 4,200+ ETFs). — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) May 29, 2025 Interest in the funds, which won approval last year, has surged as the price of the underlying asset has risen amid hopeful signs about inflation and other macroeconomic indicators. Bitcoin has also benefited from renewed investor perceptions of the asset as a safe haven largely immune to the currency volatility that has characterized the past few months. To be sure, the monthly total could dip if IBIT hemorrhages assets Thursday and Friday. The previous monthly high in March 2024 was only slightly lower. IBIT has added daily investments except for May 13 when it netted zero flows, and the fund has accounted for 90% of all spot Bitcoin ETF flows. It received a May high of $877 million in investments on May 22 and more than $3.8 billion over the past eight days. U.S.-listed spot crypto ETFs as a whole have had inflows of $6.74 billion for the month. Overall, IBIT is “essentially responsible” for all spot crypto ETF net inflows in May and for all of 2025, Sumit Roy, senior analyst at Etf.com, told Decrypt. Roy added: “Those numbers really showcase how dominant IBIT has become and how it's become THE go-to ETF for investors seeking crypto exposure in the ETF wrapper.” Institutional and retail traders have flocked to crypto ETF funds amid a more favorable political climate for digital assets in the U.S. that has also spurred countries and corporations to embrace Bitcoin. Pakistan crypto adviser Bilal Bin Saqib unveiled on Wednesday at Bitcoin 2025 that the South Asian country is establishing its own Bitcoin strategic reserve. Earlier this week, Trump Media announced it would raise $2.5 billion to invest in the token, while firms such as Semler Scientific and Strategy continue to add millions of dollars of the asset to their treasuries. The heightened interest in Bitcoin has helped send its price higher. Bitcoin was recently trading at roughly $106,500, down about 1% over the past 24 hours, although BTC is up almost 12% for the past month CoinGecko data shows. The largest crypto by market value hit a record high above $112,000 on May 22, a day after U.S. President Donald Trump held a private White House dinner with 220 crypto investors who held his meme coin.

Tokenization platform the BPX Exchange was added to the U.K.'s crypto register on Thursday, the first new addition since April and only the third this year, according to the Financial Conduct Authority's (FCA) website. The company, a digital securities exchange for investment funds, will now be able to reach out and offer its services to clients in the country as well as approve the promotions of "members of its wider group," the regulator's website said. It won't be able to operate a crypto exchange or offer any services to retail clients. Digital asset firms wishing to operate in the country need to be registered with the FCA and comply with its money laundering and promotion rules, which prevent unauthorized firms from reaching U.K. clients. A total of 52 firms have been approved since 2020. Crypto exchange Coinbase and asset manager BlackRock also joined the register this year. Not only has the U.K. been taking steps to be known as a crypto hub since 2022 by laying out new legislation and consulting with firms to establish new rules for the industry, the current government has also said it wants the country to be a tokenization hub. Tokenization occurs when companies create a virtual investment vehicle on the blockchain that is linked to real world assets like securities.

Title: Toncoin price spikes 13% amid major Telegram-related news
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/toncoin-price-spikes-13-amid-major-telegram-related-news/
Time Published: 2025-05-29T13:45:01Z

Toncoin (TON) price caught the crypto market’s attention on Wednesday as it rose sharply amid broader market struggles for Bitcoin and top altcoins. With 13% in price gains in the past 24 hours, Toncoin ranked among the top gainers on the day, outpacing the likes of Quant, Uniswap, and Injective among the top 100 by market cap. TON, native to The Open Network blockchain, rallied as traders raced to buy amid a series of major Telegram news. As the price of Toncoin soared by more than 13%, trading volume rose through the roof. As per data from CoinMarketCap, Toncoin recorded a 410% spike in volume, hitting $745 million. TON’s price reached highs of $3.69 before slightly retreating to $3.48 at the time of writing. Gains see TON token up by more than 10% in the past week. Before the latest gains, Toncoin price largely traded flat over the week, with no momentum after bulls gave up ground. Is this uptick thus going to push the altcoin to above $5? The price last hovered above these levels in early 2025. As noted above, the main catalyst for Toncoin’s notable price surge is a series of positive news. The vibe mostly relates to two major announcements linked to Telegram and the TON Foundation. First, the TON Foundation revealed the appointment of Nikola Plecas as its new Vice President of Payments. Plecas, a former Visa executive with deep expertise in crypto product innovation, is tasked with scaling TON’s payment infrastructure to cater to Telegram’s massive user base of over 1 billion. His focus will be on enhancing interoperability, security, and scalability—key pillars for mainstream adoption of Web3 payments. Plecas’s experience at Visa, where he shaped the company’s global crypto strategy, positions him as a pivotal figure in TON’s ambition to revolutionize payments within the Telegram ecosystem. Also fueling optimism around TON is news that Telegram plans to raise $1.5 billion through a bond sale. Notably, market reaction largely jumped as traders noted that Telegram’s initiative is backed by Wall Street heavyweights like Citadel and BlackRock. That’s not all. TON is also expanding its ecosystem, integrating Ethena’s USDe and tsUSDe stablecoins for in-app savings. Collaboration with Tether via LayerZero for a multi-chain network has also been a key development.

Bitcoin BTC$103,453.37 has mostly traded sideways since printing record highs above $110,000 last week. The loss of upward momentum is now accompanied by signs waning bullish sentiment among market participants trading options tied to BlackRock's spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). That's evident from the one-year put-call skew, which reflects how the market prices in volatility risk for put options, offering downside protection relative to calls, representing bullish bets. Negative values represent a bullish bias while positive values suggest fears of downside. IBIT's one-year skew has bounced to nearly zero from the four-month low of minus 3.8 two weeks ago, according to data source Market Chameleon. In other words, IBIT options traders are no longer chasing upside via options. Perhaps they are expecting a pullback. Similar mood is evident in Deribit-listed options where the short-term call skew has weakened, meaning calls expiring in the next two weeks are trading at par with puts, according to data source Amberdata.

Title: Telegram announces partnership with Musk

Time Published: 2025-05-29T09:47:09Z
Full Content:
Elon Musk’s startup xAI will invest $300 million and deploy its Grok AI chatbot in partnership with the messaging app Telegram, according to a statement by the app’s CEO Pavel Durov published on Wednesday. In announcing the deal, Durov said that he and Musk had agreed to a one-year partnership designed to strengthen Telegram’s financial position. “We will receive $300M in cash and equity from xAI, plus 50% of the revenue from xAI subscriptions sold via Telegram,” he said. Musk later stated on X that “no deal has been signed,” without providing any additional details, prompting Durov to clarify that the parties had reached an agreement in principle, with formalities still to be finalized. Telegram said Grok AI is set to be integrated into Telegram, with users expected to begin accessing the AI-powered features starting this summer. Users will be able to interact with Grok directly within the app, using a built-in chatbot to generate content or engage in open-ended conversations on a wide range of topics. The partnership with xAI comes amid an effort by Telegram to raise at least $1.5 billion through a new bond issuance, including from existing backers such as BlackRock and Abu Dhabi investment firm Mubadala. Telegram is reportedly expected to use the funds to buy back debt issued through an earlier bond sale. The deal signals that investors continue to support Telegram, even as its CEO faces charges in France. Durov, whose company is based in Dubai, was arrested in France in August 2024 and accused of complicity in crimes allegedly committed by Telegram users, including extremism and child abuse. He was later released on €5 million ($5.46 million) bail. Although he was allowed to travel to the UAE in March, his recent request to visit the US was denied, and he remains under restricted supervision. Telegram’s popularity continues to grow as the app maintains free services for users. In 2025, the messenger surpassed one billion monthly users and last year the app achieved over $1 billion in revenue, marking its first profitable year since introducing monetization. The company’s financial growth has reportedly been driven by a surge in Telegram Premium subscribers and strong advertising performance.

US-based BlackRock and Hong Kong-based Weave Living are set to acquire the 78-key Momentus Serviced Residences Novena in Singapore from a joint venture comprising three Singapore-based companies: Roxy-Pacific Holdings Pte Ltd, MACLY Capital Pte Ltd, and LWH Holdings Pte Ltd. According to market sources, the transaction price is approximately SGD100 million, translating to around SGD1.28 million per key. The 15-storey freehold property, with a total gross floor area of approximately 6,322square metres, is currently operated by the Singapore-based Momentus Hospitality Pte Ltd, a hospitality operator under Singapore-based real estate developer SingHaiyi Group. This management arrangement is expected to conclude upon completion of the sale. The property features amenities including a swimming pool, rooftop garden with barbeque facilities, and a fitness room. It is situated 550 metres away from Novena MRT station, roughly a 13-minute walk. The property was previously acquired in 2022 from Singapore-based TA Corporation Ltd for SGD86.5 million, with the current sale representing a gain of SGD14.5 million. SCCP Acquires New Blanc Central Myeongdong in Seoul, South Korea Singapore-based real estate investment manager, SC Capital Partners Group (“SCCP”), has acquired the 181-key New Blanc Central Myeongdong in Seoul, South Korea. According to market sources, the transaction price is approximately KRW70 billion, translating to approximately KRW38.7 million per key. The property is currently managed by South Korea-based hospitality operator StayNeo, and offers a range of amenities, including two food and beverage outlets, a fitness centre, a laundrette, a communal kitchen, and a lounge. Ideally located within access to four subway lines, the hotel is just a five-minute walk from Euljiro 4-ga Station (Lines 2 and 5) and Chungmuro Station (Lines 3 and 4).

Mumbai: Pandurang Budhkar Marg may not roll off the tongue like ‘BKC’, but that hasn’t deterred India’s top financial firms from making a beeline to this stretch of Worli in south-central Mumbai — once a premier business address, now staging a surprise comeback. At the centre of this revival is Altimus, a 41-storey tower co-owned by K Raheja Corp and Singapore’s GIC. Over the past two years, it has quietly pulled marquee tenants away from Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) and Lower Parel, bringing the corporate spotlight back to Worli. Its tenant list reads like a who's who of global finance: Morgan Stanley, KKR, BlackRock, Barclays, Kedaara Capital and TPG have all leased space at Altimus. Others, like Goldman Sachs, have opted for nearby Raheja projects such as Ascent. Large Indian firms — including Ultratech — are also moving in. Read this | Domestic office market surges as India becomes hub for global occupiers In the early 2000s, Worli’s Ceejay House was India’s most prestigious office address — home to Barclays, Rothschild, and Credit Suisse. But as BKC and Lower Parel powered ahead, Worli slipped out of the spotlight. That tide, it seems, is now turning — with global investors and large Indian firms returning to centrally located towers that offer top-tier infrastructure and access. The shift reflects more than a reshuffling of office addresses. As India’s financial sector expands and global firms grow their presence here, demand is surging for centrally located, premium-grade towers — just as land-constrained hubs like BKC run short on supply. According to real estate consultants Knight Frank India and Anarock Property Consultants, office vacancies in BKC have dropped to a record low of 3-4% from 13-14% four years ago, raising rents and sparking a scramble for nearby areas such as Kalina, Kurla, Worli, and Lower Parel. On average, rent has jumped from ₹300 per sq. ft to ₹400 per sq. ft in three years, Anuj Puri, chairman of Anarock, had said earlier. Maker Maxity is BKC’s costliest location, with rents crossing ₹800 per sq. ft. Average rentals in South Mumbai are less than in BKC, at ₹250-280 per sq. ft per month, according to industry experts. However, traffic bottlenecks in BKC pose challenges for many businesses, prompting some to seek more accessible locations. Speed and accessFor firms like investment management company Alta Capital, the move is about faster, easier connectivity. “The strategic location allows us to interact with all our stakeholders and partners efficiently as we are central to all the major business districts of Mumbai – BKC, Lower Parel and Nariman Point," said Sid Gupta, Alta’s founder and managing partner. The firm leased 6,000 sq. ft at TS Suites, a plug-and-play office product by managed workspace provider TableSpace, inside Altimus. Read this | Bandra Kurla Complex is packed to the gills; where do Mumbai's top corporates go next? Infrastructure has been key to Worli’s revival. The new coastal road and sea link are sharply reducing travel times from far-flung suburbs and business nodes. Mumbai Metro's Aqua Line connected to Worli this month. For executives burned out by the BKC commute, Worli’s centrality is a major draw. “There isn’t a lot of commercial space available elsewhere," said an executive from a relocating firm, adding that the commute to BKC was a “nightmare". More firms are not just moving but scaling operations in India. “(Worli has) more convenient access, a central location, and larger space," said an executive at a tenant firm. Barclays, for instance, has taken up 65,000 sq. ft in Altimus as part of its expansion strategy in India. The bank also highlighted the building’s green design and alignment with its net-zero goals for 2050. “Mumbai is where the future of business in the country is unfolding, and ‘Altimus’ truly fits in the top commercial CBD (central business district) assets, globally benchmarked for the best representation of the new emerging India," said Vinod Rohira, CEO and MD, commercial real estate, K Raheja Corp. “Within Mumbai, Worli has emerged as a powerful new magnet, offering access, infrastructure and prestige." “From high-end tech to financial services, we are seeing global firms make long-term bets on India. This is fuelling strong demand for high-quality office spaces that can keep up with the pace and complexity of modern enterprise," Rohira added. From mills to magnatesOnce an industrial zone filled with textile mills and working-class chawls, Worli began transforming in the 1990s and 2000s as mill closures cleared the way for luxury apartments and high-rises. Yet, despite that makeover, it lagged behind the commercial boom in BKC and Lower Parel. Read this | Mint Primer: Why Delhi-NCR is India’s new flex office capital Now, that’s changing. Average office rents in Worli have caught up with top-end properties in BKC, according to JLL India. BKC still commands a premium due to its central business district status and limited supply. While Maker Maxity in BKC set a record with lease rentals, average rents in Altimus, Worli, and the top buildings in BKC hover at ₹400-450 per sq. ft, reflecting a narrowing gap as Worli’s infrastructure and appeal rise, Sodi said. “Worli had lost its sheen to Lower Parel and BKC," said Karan Singh Sodi, senior managing director, MMR and Gujarat at JLL. “Now, the new infrastructure and ready supply are playing a major role in its favour." Besides Altimus and Ascent (Raheja’s 450,000 sq. ft project now anchored by Goldman Sachs), more high-end office projects are on the anvil. One of the largest will rise on a 22-acre plot acquired by Japan’s Sumitomo Corp from Bombay Dyeing in 2023. Work on the master plan is currently on. Also read | Gen…Next…Go!

The commercial resurgence mirrors trends in the residential market. In 2024 alone, ten homes in Worli sold for over ₹100 crore each, up from four such transactions the year before. In total, 30 homes priced above ₹40 crore, worth ₹4,862 crore, were sold in Worli in 2023 and 2024, according to Anarock Property Consultants.

Title: Lopez: Needless lawsuits threaten energy policy
URL: https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/05/29/lopez-needless-lawsuits-threaten-energy-policy/
Time Published: 2025-05-29T07:56:34Z
Full Content:
At the end of last year, 11 Republican state attorneys general filed a lawsuit that will have significant, presumably unintended, and somewhat strange consequences on the energy market. Naturally, the energy industry and the price Americans pay for that energy are balanced. Spearheaded by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, the lawsuit targets the “Big Three” financial asset managers: BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard. The principal accusation is that the managers manipulated the energy markets by limiting investment in coal. The complaint alleges that these financial firms have suppressed traditional energy sources by acquiring stockholdings and using their leverage to pressure coal companies to shut down or accommodate “green energy” goals. The supporting evidence is weak. As was reported at the time, the Big Three firms participated in environmental efforts aimed at working with businesses across various industries, curtailing greenhouse gas emissions, and creating long-term shareholder value. These three firms have since left many of the broad coalition initiatives they were previously committed to; State Street and BlackRock withdrew membership with Climate Action 100+, and Vanguard and BlackRock withdrew from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative. These decisions gained widespread attention, with the companies citing various reasons and all affirming their commitment to providing the best investment returns for their clients. However, during their time as participants, the lawsuit claims, the defendants plotted to lower coal prices. This appears to be the fact on which the lawsuit hinges. That claim is wrong, to be charitable. In reality, coal’s decline has resulted from economic and market trends. More affordable and efficient energy options, like natural gas and renewables, have slowly but steadily taken the lead, a trend that has occurred over many years. The most economically beneficial and productive energy agenda would be allowing all energy sources to compete freely and openly so that consumers and businesses can access reliable, affordable and secure energy. An artificially disrupted energy market, like this lawsuit would lead to, can create imbalances between supply, demand and investments, which can be costly to consumers. Any effort that artificially redirects investment — whether by encouraging or discouraging specific businesses — distorts that balance and weakens our energy grid’s long-term resilience, which is already deeply in need of investment. To update America’s declining energy infrastructure and keep pace with surging energy demand, we need broad-based investment in fossil fuels or renewables, and in nuclear power and next-generation technologies. Building a resilient and prosperous energy future requires doubling down on principles that encourage diversity in energy sources and technological innovation that improves efficiency and environmental stewardship.

Title: Tether pumps $5B into U.S tech, mining, and bonds – CEO reveals bold strategy!

Anthony Pompliano hailed Tether’s leadership and “pro-America” stance. Tether, the company behind the world’s largest stablecoin USDT, recently revealed a bold investment strategy focused on fueling growth within the United States. Over the past two years, Tether has funnelled approximately $5 billion of its profits into American companies and infrastructure, signaling a strong commitment to supporting domestic innovation. In a recent announcement on X, CEO Paolo Ardoino highlighted these significant investments, describing them as part of a “pro-America” approach. Taking to X, Ardoino said, “In the last 2 years Tether Group reinvested almost 5 billion USD of its profits within the United States economy and into US based companies. Some examples: Rumble, Blackrock Neurotech, XXI and different Bitcoin mining ventures.” Notably, earlier this year, Tether acquired more than 103 million shares of Class A stock in Rumble, committing $775 million to the video platform. Additionally, through its venture arm Tether Evo, the company invested $200 million in BlackRock Neurotech in 2024, becoming the majority stakeholder in the promising brain-interface startup. Responding to this, Anthony Pompliano added, “Tether has quickly become one of the most important pro-America companies in the world. Thank you for everything that you and the team have done.” In addition to its strategic equity investments, Tether has established a substantial footprint in U.S Treasury securities, holding more than $120 billion in total exposure. This portfolio includes direct purchases, money market funds, and reverse repurchase agreements, positioning Tether as the 19th-largest global holder of U.S Treasury bills. In fact, it has also surpassed Germany’s $111.4 billion stake, according to data from the U.S Treasury Department. These U.S Treasury holdings are vital in supporting USDT’s value, helping maintain its dollar peg and market stability. A significant portion of these holdings is reportedly managed through Cantor Fitzgerald, a prominent American financial services firm. This simply underscores Tether’s reliance on trusted domestic institutions to safeguard its reserve assets. Here, it’s worth noting that in 2025, USDT has recorded figures of $2.09 trillion in transaction volume, with USDC trailing behind at $1.30 trillion, according to Visa’s on-chain analytics. Tether has also recently issued an additional $1 billion worth of USDT on the Tron (TRX) blockchain network. Despite its dominant market position, Tether faces ongoing demands for greater transparency regarding its reserve holdings. Additionally, the stablecoin has drawn criticism for its occasional use by illicit actors. However, the company maintains that it actively collaborates with law enforcement agencies to identify and address any criminal activities involving USDT. This could be a sign of its commitment to regulatory compliance amid growing scrutiny.

Title: JioBlackRock AMC to widen reach, target flows with factor-based passive funds

Capital market regulator SEBI has given permission to Reliance Industries-owned Jio Financial Services and the American multi-national investment management company BlackRock to enter the mutual fund business in six months. The combination of Reliance Jio’s vast digital reach with BlackRock’s global investment expertise, the joint venture will democratise investment opportunities by attracting first-time retail investors. The competition in the MF industry has intensified with the entry of new players especially after SEBI eased the entry barriers to allow more players to enter asset management business and attract new investors from smaller cities. In last one year, the asset under MF industry increased 23 per cent to ₹70 lakh crore while the value of assets held by individual investors in MFs increased 21 per cent to ₹42 lakh crore. In fact, it will be a re-entry after 7 years for BlackRock into the Indian MF business after it sold 40 per cent stake in DSP MF. Tanmay Shah, MD, stock broking firm SIHL said the entry of Jio BlackRock into the asset management business marks a potentially disruptive shift, given the fact that MF penetration is still low. However, he said challenges remain in building investors trust, navigating regulatory requirements and competing with well-established AMCs. On the distribution side, AMFI last year granted execution-only platform license to Jio Payment Bank, a subsidiary of Jio Financial Services. EOP is a digital or online platform, which facilitates MF transactions such as subscription, redemption and switch transactions. Sunil Subramaniam, CEO of independent think-tank Sense and Simplicity said JioBlackRock will try to target becoming the largest player in the passives space by launching multiple factor-based passive funds which tweak an index to generate higher alpha and attract investment from large institutional investors like provident funds and family offices. By bringing in variation in the passive categories, the fund house may be able to charge a slightly higher fee. Using Jio’s marketing muscle it will try to protect its margins by going direct to customers, he said. With Jio Financial focusing on marketing and customer acquisition, and BlackRock bringing in its global expertise in passives, JioBlackRock MF will attempt to disrupt the market and achieve scale in the shortest possible time, he added. The fund will also open an office in GIFT City to channel inward and outbound foreign investments to take advantage of Blackrock’s Global expertise, said Subramaniam.

Title: Bitcoin Over Gold? BlackRock Says The Case Is Clear
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-over-gold-blackrock/
Time Published: 2025-05-28T23:00:47Z
Full Content:
Speaking from the Nakamoto Stage at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference, Robert Mitchnick, Head of Digital Assets at BlackRock, made a compelling case for BTC’s unique position in global finance—suggesting that the world’s largest asset manager sees Bitcoin not only as a legitimate portfolio hedge but also as a superior alternative to gold. Mitchnick described the performance of BlackRock’s iShares BTC Trust (IBIT) as “unprecedented,” but emphasized that this was still the early stage of adoption. “It’s very early in the life cycle of an ETF,” he said. “In many instances, it takes multiple years to truly get all the cylinders firing—from education to institutional diligence to onboarding across major wealth platforms.” While IBIT has already gained massive traction in US markets, BlackRock has recently launched a similar product in Europe and sees global expansion as essential. “We’re excited,” Mitchnick said. “This has really been a global story… even if you look at IBIT’s numbers, a massive amount of that actually comes from offshore wealth channels, including Asia.” A key theme of Mitchnick’s remarks was the growing institutional normalization of BTC. He cited BlackRock’s own model portfolios—widely used by wealth managers—as a turning point. “In February of this year, just about three months ago, one of those portfolios added Bitcoin as an allocation in the 1 to 2% range,” Mitchnick said. “That was not a sudden reaction to any one thing—that was the result of multiple years of analysis and research.” These allocations, he explained, allow financial advisers to include BTC without requiring direct client demand, accelerating passive adoption across advisory networks. Mitchnick pushed back hard against the long-standing claim that BTC merely behaves like a speculative tech stock. “Through most of Bitcoin’s history, it’s had very low correlation [to equities],” he noted. While he acknowledged periods of short-term alignment—particularly among leveraged retail traders—he argued that institutional investors see BTC differently: “They view Bitcoin as a differentiator in a portfolio and a potential hedge against some of the left-tail risks that exist elsewhere in traditional assets.” He illustrated the point with a sharp anecdote: “Think back to August 5th… the market had a mini meltdown and Bitcoin got clobbered that day. It had nothing to do with Bitcoin fundamentally… but Bitcoin doubled over the next four months.” According to Mitchnick, this shows how short-term volatility often leads to accumulation by long-term holders—those who view Bitcoin not as a “risk-on asset” but as a monetary hedge. Asked directly about the ongoing gold-versus-BTC debate, Mitchnick avoided the typical zero-sum framing. “They’re both global, scarce, decentralized, fixed-supply assets,” he said. “Gold has much less volatility and a longer history. But Bitcoin is digitally native, efficient to store, and can be transferred anywhere in near real time at near-zero cost.” Then he delivered the verdict: “Bitcoin has much higher upside than gold—and lower downside.” He also addressed why this narrative isn’t more dominant. “It’s amazing to me that the industry hasn’t promoted this more effectively,” he said, criticizing financial media and research firms that still link BTC’s value to irrelevant macro headlines. “Bitcoin’s never heard of tariffs. Doesn’t know what they are.” When asked about future crypto ETFs beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, Mitchnick drew a firm line. “Bitcoin is in a category of one,” he said. “The rest of crypto competes in different lanes, with different use cases… it looks more like tech equities or venture exposure.” As a result, he expects the correlation between BTC and other digital assets to fall further. On the topic of regulation, Mitchnick welcomed the growing bipartisan interest in Washington. “It’s just a great and encouraging thing that there is such momentum behind developing a regulatory framework,” he said. “Whether we’re talking about stablecoins or market structure, there’s great momentum there—and we’re excited to see how that shakes out.” At press time, BTC traded at $108,879.

XRP is back in the spotlight, now trading hands at just under $2.30. Investors remain bullish as excitement builds over a potential U.S.-listed spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) going live in the near future. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is now evaluating whether a proposed XRP ETF by WisdomTree offers adequate investor protection and safeguards against manipulation. The fund would be a major step toward broader institutional access and legitimacy for the Ripple-affiliated crypto if approved. According to a May 27 notice published by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, has started reviewing the WisdomTree XRP Trust. This marks the first formal review of a U.S.-based spot XRP ETF by the Commission. The SEC now has up to 240 days to approve or reject the ETF filing that would allow investors to gain exposure to XRP without having to hold or store the token themselves. The investment vehicle would track XRP’s market price via the CME CF Ripple-Dollar Reference Rate. If greenlighted, the WisdomTree XRP Trust would be the first American spot XRP market ETF — a watershed that could unlock the door for similar vehicles based on other altcoins. The Commission is now looking for public comments on whether the ETF’s design satisfactorily addresses concerns related to market manipulation and investor protection. Besides WisdomTree, a bevy of other investment managers, including Franklin Templeton, 21Shares, Bitwise, and Grayscale, have all applied with the SEC to introduce XRP ETFs in the U.S. This comes as a new Trump-Vance administration has rolled into Washington, which has taken a more lenient approach to crypto. The SEC itself has also turned a new regulatory leaf following former SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s departure in January, dropping most of the high-profile cases lodged during the Biden era. Bloomberg senior ETF analysts forecast an 85% chance of spot XRP ETF approval after the change in leadership at the SEC. The price of XRP is trading lower by 3.4% over the past 24 hours to $2.26. Approval of spot exchange-traded funds could unlock institutional capital, amplifying demand for XRP and potentially propelling prices toward $10. Some analysts even believe the XRP price could hit the elusive $100 threshold if prominent players like BlackRock and Fidelity jump into the ring.

The IPO would deepen the existing relationship between BlackRock and Circle, as it would constitute one of the largest single-investor stakes in the crypto company. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock plans to acquire approximately 10% of the shares offered in Circle’s initial public offering (IPO), Bloomberg News reported on May 28. People familiar with the matter said Circle and its shareholders, including co-founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire, are seeking to raise $624 million through the offering. Orders for the offering have reportedly exceeded the number of shares available, with the pricing scheduled for June 4. BlackRock already manages the Circle Reserve Fund, a government money market fund that holds roughly 90% of the reserves backing Circle’s USDC stablecoin. The fund reported nearly $30 billion in net assets as of April 30, 2024, based on the Circle IPO filing. The investment management firm could acquire its stake directly or through an affiliated entity, although its final participation remains subject to change. As a result, the IPO would deepen the existing relationship between BlackRock and Circle, as it would constitute one of the largest single-investor stakes in the crypto company. The filing also revealed a combined interest from major institutional investors, indicating heightened demand for equity in the stablecoin issuer as it prepares to enter the public markets. Circle’s USDC ranks as the second-largest US dollar-pegged stablecoin with a $61.3 billion market cap and plays a central role in crypto transfers. The stablecoin registered a $10 trillion year-to-date transfer volume as of April 30, according to data from Artemis. Pending legislation in Congress proposes backing stablecoins with cash or government securities, a structure already in place for USDC through the Circle Reserve Fund. Circle’s decision to proceed with a US-based IPO reflects broader efforts by crypto companies to secure public market capitalization at a time when federal regulatory policy is trending toward acceptance. Kraken is also reportedly eyeing an IPO for 2026. The IPO filing formalizes Circle’s long-anticipated listing plans, which previously included a terminated Special Purpose Acquisition Company deal in 2022. With backing from institutional players and a reserve fund managed by the world’s largest asset manager, Circle is positioning itself to expand operations under a more transparent and regulated capital structure.

BlackRock Inc. is considering acquiring roughly 10% of the shares offered in Circle’s upcoming initial public offering (IPO), Bloomberg reported Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter. The IPO filing, made public on Tuesday, lays out plans to offer 24 million Class A shares — 9.6 million from Circle and 14.4 million from existing stakeholders. According to the filing, Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management has expressed interest in buying up to $150 million worth of the IPO shares. The shares are expected to be priced between $24 and $26, and will be trading under the ticker 'CRCL'. BlackRock’s potential involvement, though significant, is still up in the air. Bloomberg reported that it remains unclear whether BlackRock would invest directly or via an affiliated vehicle, and that it could ultimately walk away from the deal. BlackRock didn't immediately respond to CoinDesk's request for comment. The asset management giant already maintains a close relationship with Circle. It manages the Circle Reserve Fund, a government money market fund that holds 90% of the reserves backing Circle’s USDC stablecoin. USDC is one of the largest dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies, used widely across crypto trading and DeFi protocols. If BlackRock follows through, the move would mark another major entry point for traditional finance into the digital asset space, further entrenching stablecoins like USDC in the broader financial system. The IPO would make Circle one of the few large crypto-native firms to go public in the U.S. after a long lull in public market debuts from the sector. Circle previously attempted to go public via a SPAC merger in 202, which was subsequently scrapped.

The native token of the Telegram-affiliated The Open Network, the 18th largest crypto by market value, was trading at $3.37, CoinGecko data shows. TON soared to almost $3.70 and was up about 23% at one point earlier in the morning. Telegram’s fortunes, which have risen in recent months, continued to swing upward on Wednesday. The company is preparing to raise $1.5 billion in a corporate-bond sale, The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday, citing several sources familiar with the company's plans. The messaging platform will issue five-year bonds offering a 9% yield—a raise that has invited interest from Emirati-owned investment firm Mubadala, BlackRock, and hedge-fund manager Citadel, according to The Journal. Telegram has shared with investors that it clocked $540 million in profits on $1.4 billion in revenue in 2024, people familiar with the matter told the publication—a major rebound from its lackluster performance the year prior. The app boasted one billion active users as of March 2025, according to Telegram's executives, and enrollment in its subscription services has roughly doubled over the past year or so. Separately, Telegram will deploy AI-powered chatbot Grok to its growing platform under the terms of a one-year agreement with Elon Musk's xAI, Telegram founder Pavel Durov said Wednesday in a social media post. Telegram will receive half of xAI's subscription sales made through the messaging platform, Durov tweeted. Later in the day, however, Musk pushed back on the announcement, replying on X hat "No deal has been signed." Durov replied, "True. Agreed in principle, but formalities are pending." The price of TON dipped following the exchange. Durov is still facing criminal charges in France related to alleged illegal activities hosted on Telegram, leaving the application's future somewhat uncertain. French authorities arrested Durov in August, alleging Telegram facilitated terrorism and drug trafficking enterprises, among other nefarious activities, on its platform. And earlier this month, authorities declined the founder's appeal to travel to the U.S. for "negotiations with investment funds,” POLITICO reported. Telegram created TON in 2018, but distanced itself from the network just two years later as it faced regulatory scrutiny over its role in the project. However, the messaging application began flirting with TON nearly two years later, hosting the TON Wallet App and tap-to-earn games in its application. The latter initiative helped TON garner widespread recognition last year, as viral tap-to-earn games such as Catizen and Hamster Kombat‌ amassed hundreds of millions of players on Telegram.

Title: TON jumps 16% as Telegram gets $300M plus xAI equity to integrate Grok

Telegram bags $300M in xAI deal as profits and bond bets reset trajectory. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Telegram is no longer just a privacy-first chat app for crypto bros. With a dramatic one-two punch, a $300 million alliance with Elon Musk’s xAI and a $1.5 billion high-yield bond raise, Telegram has moved from insurgent platform to profit engine. TON jumped 15% after Durov confirmed the collaboration. Yet its future, including IPO prospects, remains hostage to a legal tangle playing out in French courts. In a headline-grabbing move, Telegram announced an exclusive distribution agreement with xAI that will embed Grok, Musk’s LLM chatbot, into the platform for one year. The terms: xAI will pay $300 million in cash, as well as equity and 50% of all Grok-related subscription revenue generated through Telegram. “Together, we win ❤️📈🏆,” posted CEO Pavel Durov, celebrating what he framed as a platform-defining moment. The move marks Telegram’s first major monetisation of its 1 billion monthly active users (MAUs) – a sharp pivot from its historically donation- and debt-fuelled operations. Durov has insisted that Grok integration won’t compromise user data: “No Telegram data will be supplied for Grok training,” he wrote. The deal puts Telegram ahead of rivals like WhatsApp and Snapchat, who’ve struggled to extract revenue from AI features within messaging ecosystems. Telegram also disclosed its first-ever profit: $540 million in 2024, on revenue of $1.4 billion. This figure marks a dramatic turnaround from prior years, when the company operated at a steep loss. With 15 million paying users and organic growth of 2.5 million users per day, 2025 revenue is forecasted at $2 billion, with profit exceeding $700 million. For investors, the metrics finally validate Telegram’s long-gestating monetisation model. Along with announcing its AI deal, Telegram completed an oversubscribed $1.5 billion bond offering at a 9% yield, with major backers including BlackRock, Citadel, and Mubadala, according to WSJ. The five-year paper refinances debt from a 2021 convertible note and includes an IPO-linked conversion sweetener, an implicit bet that Telegram will go public before 2030. The bond’s success surprised some market watchers, especially given CEO Durov’s ongoing legal entanglements. But investors appear willing to price that risk as noise against Telegram’s unit economics and growth profile. Despite operational momentum, a significant cloud looms over Telegram’s prospects: founder Pavel Durov’s arrest in France in August 2024 and subsequent indictment on 12 preliminary charges, including non-cooperation with child safety investigations. Durov remains under judicial supervision and is barred from leaving France. A May 12 court ruling blocked his planned trip to the U.S. to meet investors. “We complied with all the binding legal requests we received,” Durov told the WSJ. “Up until this day, we don’t understand what we did wrong.” The legal case could delay or derail IPO ambitions, raise governance concerns, and complicate global platform operations. It also emphasizes broader regulatory questions about the liabilities of end-to-end encrypted app providers. Is Telegram now on a glide path to IPO? Possibly, but not inevitably. The bond’s conversion feature suggests that at least the option remains alive. But some analysts argue the high-yield raise could be a bridge or even a hedge, a way to lock in growth without public-market scrutiny while Durov navigates his legal peril. The one-year Grok integration, too, carries open questions: Will AI subs stick? Can xAI deliver? Will regulators scrutinise the data layer despite Durov’s assurances? And if Musk stumbles, what becomes of the promised $300 million? Still, with its platform pivot, Telegram has shed the image of a burning-money outlier. Whether it becomes a public tech titan or a cautionary tale may depend as much on courtroom outcomes as on product-market fit. Telegram’s summer surge, marked by AI monetisation and a bold debt raise, signals a company evolving into a sustainable business.

Share this article RedStone is launching its blockchain oracle services on Solana in partnership with Securitize, enabling access to tokenized traditional financial assets like US Treasuries and credit products, the company announced on Wednesday. The integration, powered by Wormhole Queries, is aimed at providing Solana builders with price feeds for both traditional and crypto assets. Developers can now incorporate real-world assets (RWAs), such as Apollo’s $ACRED or BlackRock’s $BUIDL, into dApps. Discussing the launch, RedStone co-founder Marcin Kazmierczak said the development represents a foundational shift in how tokenized RWAs are utilized on Solana. Rather than serving solely as static, tokenized instruments, RWAs can now be actively composed within DeFi protocols, enabling practical use cases that bridge traditional financial products with on-chain systems. “This is a foundational step in making RWAs not just visible but usable in DeFi on Solana,” said Kazmierczak in a statement. “It’s no longer just about tokenization — it’s about composability and unlocking use cases that merge traditional and onchain finance.” Securitize, which partners with major asset managers including Apollo, BlackRock, and VanEck, has chosen RedStone as the oracle provider for its tokenized products. The company said it has accumulated over $3.6 billion in tokenized assets under management. “We’re seeing the walls come down between TradFi and DeFi,” said Securitize’s Head of Credit and DeFi, Reid Simon. “The next evolution is about giving global institutions the tools to transact seamlessly across chains.” RedStone’s collaboration with Securitize, announced in March, helps enhance the usability of Securitize’s tokenized funds across DeFi platforms. RedStone delivers price feeds for these assets, enabling their integration into money market exchanges and collateralized DeFi platforms, with cross-chain capabilities on networks such as Ethereum, Avalanche, and Polygon. Earlier this month, RedStone’s $ACRED feed was successfully deployed in a Morpho vault on Polygon, one of the first live DeFi vaults to integrate a major RWA. The Solana expansion could enable similar products to reach a wider audience, from retail to institutional users. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?
