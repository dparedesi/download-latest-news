Spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. saw $94.3 million of total inflows on the last day of February as crypto's worst month in three years came to an end. The figure capped an eight-day streak of outflow during which investors pulled over $3.2 billion from these funds as digital asset prices fell. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), the largest spot bitcoin ETF by assets under management, was one of the outliers that saw $244.6 million in outflows on Friday. Meanwhile, other large ETFs, including Fidelity’s FBTC, brought in $176 million from investors, while the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF saw the largest inflows, bringing in $193.7 million, according to Farside Investors data. The inflows came as the cryptocurrency market started showing signs of recovery after the price of bitcoin hit a $78,000 low in the early hours of Feb. 28. Bitcoin is now trading around $84,900 after rising 1.6% in the last 24 hours, while the broader CoinDesk 20 Index rose 0.3% to 2,705. Over the past week, BTC is still down by roughly 12%, while the broader crypto market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index, fell by 15.8%. Spot bitcoin ETFs had been enduring a significant outflow streak since Feb. 14, a day in which these funds saw $66.2 million inflows. Spot ether ETFs, on the other hand, have maintained an ongoing outflow streak on the last day of February, with $41.9 million leaving these funds. Since their last day with a positive net flow, $357.5 million exited these funds, according to data from Farside. The recent market recovery comes as the White House announced that U.S. President Donald Trump will host a crypto summit on March 7 and after the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, added a 1% to 2% allocation of its spot bitcoin ETF to one of its model portfolios.

The cryptocurrency market is showing initial signs of recovery from its worst month in three years after the price of bitcoin (BTC) plunged to $78,000 in a week that saw the space’s total market capitalization drop by over $400 billion. The dip in prices saw the Crypto Fear & Greed Index plunge to 10, a level that hadn’t been seen since the 2022 bear market. However, it has since recovered to 20 while still being in the “extreme fear” range. Bitcoin’s price has now risen more than 3% in the last 24-hour period to now trade above $84,400, while the broader CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) rose 1.5% in the same period to 2,700. Its performance is being affected by SOL dipping nearly 3% in the period, while other components are up for the day. The cryptocurrency market seemed to have caught a bid after the White House announced that U.S. President Donald Trump will host a crypto summit on March 7. Summit attendees are set to include “prominent founders, CEOs, and investors from the crypto industry, as well as members of the President's Working Group on Digital Assets, according to a press release. The event is the latest sign of the Trump administration’s pro-crypto policies. It comes after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dropped lawsuits against Coinbase and MetaMask developer Consensys, as well as investigations Into Robinhood, Gemini, Uniswap Labs, and OpenSea. In addition, the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, has added a 1% to 2% allocation of its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) to one of its model portfolios. These models propose portfolio and rebalancing strategies that are subsequently executed by advisors and platforms. This is the first time BlackRock has decided to add IBIT to any of its models, opening up the potential for a new wave of demand for bitcoin ETFs. As of December 31, 2024, BlackRock’s model portfolios manage approximately $150 billion in assets.Read more: Bitcoin Dip-Buyers Step in Friday, but What Might Weekend Action Bring?

Title: How Open-Access Networks Boost Your Internet Provider Options

Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks. If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. How we test ISPs Open-access networks bring fast fiber to cities nationwide but don’t operate like typical internet service providers. It's not Santa and his sleigh, but trucks like these bring a present of another kind: the gift of fiber connectivity. Colorful painted symbols decorate the streets a few blocks from my Albuquerque, New Mexico, home. Bright arrows and checks mark hidden water and gas lines. Large trucks with boring machines and vast spools of orange pipe are parked along the sidewalks. They’re here to install fiber for Gigapower, an open-access network. An open-access fiber network is installed by a company that then sells access to ISPs. That means you can have multiple providers offering plans for your house. When Gigapower arrives at my house, it won’t be my internet service provider. Gigapower represents a different fiber model. Here’s what home internet customers need to know about open-access networks. Locating local internet providers Chances are, your home is covered by one or more internet providers, each with its own infrastructure -- whether cable, fiber, DSL or 5G, like my T-Mobile Home Internet. Open-access networks flip this concept on its head. An open-access fiber network is installed by a company that then sells access to ISPs. That means you can have multiple providers offering plans for your house. They use the same infrastructure but may have different prices, services and bundles. Locating local internet providers Don’t be surprised if you haven’t heard about open-access networks before. “Open access is not mainstream,” says Gary Bolton, president and CEO of the Fiber Broadband Association. “It’s kind of an edge case in the US.” Bolton says the concept is more widespread in countries where regulations and government involvement mean open access is common. You’re about to hear more about open-access networks thanks to Gigapower’s ambitious plans to expand fiber into previously overlooked communities. “From an operator's perspective, it's a no-brainer because someone else bears the cost of building out the network,” says Bolton. You’ll find two types of open-access networks in the US. Municipally-owned networks are owned by cities. Private companies own commercial networks. They both work in a similar fashion, usually with multiple ISPs competing for customers. The Utah Telecommunication Open Infrastructure Agency (Utopia Fiber) is a community-owned fiber network covering homes in 21 Utah cities, including Brigham City, Orem, Payson and Woodland Hills. The Utopia communities weren’t satisfied with existing home internet options. They wanted fast fiber. “If the incumbent operators aren't willing to make the investment, then the community takes it in their hands because they need it for economic development,” says Bolton. Gigapower is an example of a commercial open-access network. The company is a joint venture between telecommunications giant AT&T and investment company BlackRock. In Albuquerque, AT&T Fiber is signed on as an anchor tenant, but that still leaves room for other ISPs to potentially jump on board and compete to offer fiber internet to customers. When ISPs share the same network, they want to stand out from the crowd. That can translate into a complex dance of promotions, pricing and streaming or phone bundle options. Gigapower’s rollout is still young, so we have yet to see how this might play out in the longer term, but we can look to Utopia for clues. With the Utopia model, consumers cover two fees. One is the monthly price paid to the ISP and the other is the fiber connection cost for Utopia, which typically runs $30 monthly. Put the two together to get your total. For example, you could sign up for XMission’s 1Gbps plan for $54. Adding in the Utopia fee brings your monthly total to around $85. Bolton says that’s pretty typical for gigabit pricing on an open-access network. “You start seeing there's a lot of bundling going on,” Bolton says. “Providers typically try to find other things of value that they can add to sweeten the deal.” If you’re shopping among ISPs on an open-access network, look at promotions, bundles, add-ons and the provider’s customer service reputation. Scan the Utopia providers’ pricing and you won’t see huge swings at the 250Mbps, gigabit or 2.5Gbps plan levels. But there is one area where pricing varies widely. Not all ISPs offer 10Gbps plans, but those that do have prices ranging from $110 to $200 per month. That won’t likely affect very many customers. Here’s how to figure out how much internet speed you really need. Utopia and Gigapower are two big names in open-access networks, but others exist. Colorado Springs Utilities, for example, is building out with Ting Internet as its initial anchor tenant. Other communities scattered around the country -- including Ammon, Idaho and Ashland, Oregon -- have open-access networks as well. On the commercial side, Ubiquity is expanding with a focus on Arizona, California, Nebraska and Texas. SiFi Networks specializes in citywide open-access fiber with networks under construction in California, Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan and New York. Cities that feel passed over for fast fiber broadband will continue to consider open-access networks. Meanwhile, Gigapower’s rapid expansion could bring more commercial companies into the fold. “I think it’s a great model and I wouldn’t be surprised if other people took advantage of it,” says Bolton. While gigabit speeds are common across fiber networks, most can offer faster services to homes. Utopia, for example, goes up to 10Gbps with some ISPs. AT&T Fiber typically offers up to 5Gbps. The open-access networks going in across the country can be scaled up to handle the internet demands of the future. “This is the final network for at least the next couple of generations,” says Bolton. There’s a hunger for fiber. Albuquerque has been a cable and DSL town for too long. Gigapower isn’t the only fiber player in the city. Ezee Fiber, Vexus Fiber and Quantum Fiber are all staking out parts of town with traditional networks, but Gigapower is coming in hot. I’ll notice Gigapower when it shows up on my street to install the bright orange tubes to run fiber. After that, I likely won’t give it much thought. I’ll be dealing with AT&T Fiber as my ISP, and, perhaps someday, I’ll be comparing AT&T with a competitor using the same network. Ultimately, what’s most important to me as a customer isn’t how the fiber gets here, just that it gets here. If that means ISPs competing on pricing and bundles down the line, then all the better. An open-access network is installed and operated by a company that leases access to ISPs. That means multiple providers can offer plans to customers using the same fiber network. An open-access network is one way a community overlooked for fiber can access fast, symmetrical broadband services. If private companies aren’t willing to invest, cities can use a municipal model instead. On the commercial side, open access networks remove the burden of installation and operation from ISPs, which can then piggyback on the network to reach customers. Plus, customers may benefit from competition among ISPs looking to differentiate themselves through pricing, customer service, perks or bundles. Competition among ISPs on an open-access network can benefit consumers, but don’t expect cut-rate price wars. There may be slight contrasts in pricing but more significant differences in phone and video bundles or free add-ons like streaming services. Also, look for promotional deals, like one or two months of free service for new customers.

Title: The radical left is boycotting companies abandoning leftist insanity

Skip to comments. Posted on 03/01/2025 4:55:19 AM PST by MtnClimber Today might be a great day to go shopping. If you’ve already been to Walmart, Target, or other major retailers, you might have noticed that the people there looked...well, normal. No blue hair. No nose rings. No giant holes in their earlobes. No tattoos. No “Free Palestine” t-shirts. No bearded men in dresses and heels. It might have looked strangely like shopping in 1985, at the height of Reagan’s America. If you noticed all that, it’s because you were the beneficiary of a leftist boycott of major retailers who have decided to abandon leftist extremism (DEI, BLM, LGBTQ+, CRT, and whatever other acronyms leftists love). Instead, they’ve decided to back normal Americans, rather than the anti-American, antisemitic, anti-Christian, anti-capitalist, and anti-free speech, and pro-everything weird, vile, debased, and debauched. I only know about the boycott because I saw it in the fever swamps of former high school classmates who were riding high during the Biden and Obama years, and who have hit the emotional bottom now that MAGA’s back in town. First, there was the cute bunny poster instructing people “Don’t buy stuff Friday Feb 28” because “we have power.” They were told to skip Amazon (Jeff Bezos came out in favor of free speech), Walmart (which is ostensibly abandoning DEI), Target (which actually seems to have abandoned DEI), fast food restaurants (e.g., McDonald’s has rolled back DEI), and all gas suppliers (I assume that’s because of climate change). The pierced, blue-haired, sexually confused crowd is also being told to use cash, because credit card companies are seemingly also bad. Small businesses are good, which leaves one wondering if any among the leftists understands that McDonald’s is a franchise-based outlet, making each outlet a small business, often owned by up-and-coming minorities.

First, there was the cute bunny poster instructing people “Don’t buy stuff Friday Feb 28” because “we have power.” They were told to skip Amazon (Jeff Bezos came out in favor of free speech), Walmart (which is ostensibly abandoning DEI), Target (which actually seems to have abandoned DEI), fast food restaurants (e.g., McDonald’s has rolled back DEI), and all gas suppliers (I assume that’s because of climate change). The pierced, blue-haired, sexually confused crowd is also being told to use cash, because credit card companies are seemingly also bad. Small businesses are good, which leaves one wondering if any among the leftists understands that McDonald’s is a franchise-based outlet, making each outlet a small business, often owned by up-and-coming minorities.

Title: A cofounder shares how he pitched his startup and 'earned' his way to compete with Microsoft and Salesforce
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/watershed-taylor-francis-how-to-pitch-startup-salesforce-microsoft-compeitition-2025-2
Time Published: 2025-03-01T12:55:02Z
Full Content:
As cofounder of Watershed, an emissions data-tracking startup, Taylor Francis's job is to convince companies to spend money on reducing their carbon footprint — even in a political landscape that may be hostile to climate initiatives. Francis co-founded the software startup in 2019 with two former Stripe colleagues, Avi Itskovich and Christian Anderson, at the tail end of the first Trump administration, which aggressively scaled back climate-oriented incentives and regulations. At the time, their investor pitch was simple: There's money to be made in climate action. Six years later, with the onset of a second Trump term, Francis told Business Insider the message remains the same. "We've been here before," he said. In February 2024, the startup announced a $100 million Series C funding round at a $1.8 billion valuation. And January 2025 was Watershed's "best month ever as a business" regarding new revenue, Francis said. He did not disclose a figure. Today, Francis said his biggest competitors are Salesforce and Microsoft which also offer similar emissions-tracking services. He said his clients include 60 of the Fortune 500 companies. "I feel like that's a problem we've earned our way into recently," he said. Business Insider visited Francis at Watershed's 23,000-square-foot office in San Francisco's SoMa neighborhood, where his nearly 400 employees are encouraged to come into work. He told BI he likes to operate in an "old school" way: in person, where people can freely exchange ideas in front of a whiteboard. Francis shared how he first pitched his company to investors in 2019 and the challenges he navigates today. The interview was condensed and edited for clarity. Was it hard getting companies onboard with Watershed in 2019? Yeah, I mean, 2019 was in the first Trump administration. It seemed no one had ever done this before — getting companies to spend money on software for climate. People had spent money on consultants, they'd spent money on [carbon] offsets. And I think that the mega trend that we are both riding and trying to accelerate is that climate is getting more and more in-the-money for companies. That was the pitch at the time — there's money in pursuing climate initiatives. Honestly, the first slide of our sales deck was the same in 2019 as it is today. Literally the first slide of the sales deck. It looks better, it's been redesigned, but it still says: "Software to measure, reduce, and report your carbon emissions, because climate action is good for your business." Here's the thing, I'll say January 2025 was our best month ever as a business. What do you think is happening there? I think that we are indexed to companies doing the work on climate, not indexed to companies talking publicly about their work on climate. We see now that companies are behind the scenes. When you're an enterprise software, you kind of get to see the inside of organizations and whether they're thinking about this in a thoughtful way. The companies are going about this with more organizational seriousness now than they did three years ago. They're saying much less about it, but the executive leader who's responsible has shifted from chief sustainability officer to the chief financial officer. Who are your competitors? Microsoft and Salesforce. They have these modules. It's nice market validation that they think this is a big opportunity, but there's just a difference in product quality when it's the only thing you do. A Salesforce spokesperson told Business Insider in an email that sustainability management is "fundamentally a data challenge" that requires a unified platform. A Microsoft spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. What's the hardest thing right now? Honestly, I think it's pretty pedestrian: enterprise software challenges.How do you make it a no-brainer for companies to buy a nice piece of software rather than a module from someone they've already purchased from? How do you manage a growing team between San Francisco and London? Two years ago, Watershed was a hundred people, now it's 380 people. How do you make sure you're delivering well for companies at the scale of Walmart who have enormous expectations about this sort of thing? How many customers do you have now? I don't know that we've shared that publicly, but we have more than 500 clients now than the 5 clients we had when John Doerr [the Chair of Kleiner Perkins] joined us in 2021. What was your reaction when BlackRock — a Watershed client with $11.6 trillion in assets under management — pulled out of the Net Zero Asset Management Initiative? We work with a pretty broad set of the financial sector and I will say that they are doing the work with more seriousness today than when we started working with them. And so I think there just is this talk-action ratio thing, where a bunch of companies around the Glasgow climate conference came out with huge press releases with big bold claims and had not really figured out the data yet. Today, you see the pullback on the pledges, and companies — behind the scenes — know what they're doing. They've got the initiatives that they're prioritizing. So I think the talk-action ratio has flipped. Is it a good time for climate action in the world right now? No. Obviously the policy pendulum matters and the policy pendulum is not swinging in the right direction. But — behind the scenes with companies — I think people are doing more, even though they're talking less. Jump to

The bitcoin price has climbed back to around $85,000 per bitcoin but remains at a “critical juncture” as a perfect storm sweeps the crypto market. Now, as traders yank a record amount from bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock has added bitcoin into its $150 billion model-portfolio ecosystem for the first time—described as a “big deal” by one analyst. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink has led Wall Streets charge into bitcoin and crypto—pushing the ... [+] bitcoin price higher. “This is a big deal because this is the first of those models to add bitcoin,” James Seyffart, ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, told Coindesk, adding, “it probably won’t be the last.” BlackRock is adding a 1% to 2% allocation to the IBIT iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF in its target allocation portfolios that allow for alternatives and are aimed at investors with higher risk tolerance. BlackRock led a campaign to get a spot bitcoin ETF approved in the U.S. through 2023, with a fleet of bitcoin funds making their debut in January 2024 before surging to become some of the fastest growing ETFs of all time. U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs broke $100 billion in net assets for the first time in November, led by BlackRock’s $48 billion iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), giving those holding it exposure to its near-600,000 bitcoin. “We believe bitcoin has long-term investment merit and can potentially provide unique and additive sources of diversification to portfolios," Michael Gates, lead portfolio manager for BlackRock’s Target Allocation ETF model portfolio suite, wrote this week in investment commentary seen by Bloomberg. However, Seyffart said that as bitcoin is such a divisive asset, "I don’t know if or when they would add IBIT to their primary models that have a lot more money tracking them.” Last month, Abu Dhabi’s $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund revealed it purchased $436 million worth of BlackRock’s bitcoin ETF during the final quarter of last year, kicking off a global adoption “race” amid calls for the creation of a strategic bitcoin reserve to reduce the U.S.’s spiraling, near-$36 trillion national debt.

[+] billion in just one day from a fleet of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), led by BlackRock's IBIT bitcoin ETF. The bitcoin price rebound—coming as the latest U.S. inflation data in the form of the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index came in at expectations, boosting the chances the Federal Reserve will resume its planned series of interest rate cuts—has emboldened bullish traders and analysts. “With PCE aligning with expectations and inflation concerns balanced by upcoming rate cut prospects, bitcoin may finally get the catalyst it needs to break out of its current $80,000 to $85,000 range and push toward the coveted $100,ooo psychological level,” Matt Mena, crypto research strategist at crypto ETF issuer 21Shares, said in emailed comments. “ETF inflows continue to build momentum, institutional demand is growing, and with regulatory clarity improving, bitcoin is on the verge of another major leg up. If this breakout occurs, it could open the door for an accelerated price discovery phase, further solidifying crypto’s role in the broader macro landscape.”

Title: I went to a major bitcoin conference as a crypto skeptic. I still have doubts, but I see why buying the dip is worth the risk.

As a cryptocurrency skeptic, I arrived at the Bitcoin Investor Week conference in New York City significantly outnumbered. I was armed only with my backpack, a notepad, and an open mind. Eight hours later, I left with something else: a newfound fondness for the crypto community, and a plan to buy bitcoin for the first time in years. Like many small-time investors, I've had a love-hate relationship with crypto. I first bought $50 worth of bitcoin in June 2020 when it traded for about $9,300. That would now be worth $455 if I had held through the ups and downs. As bitcoin soared, I bought more, and I later bought some dogecoin and ethereum, inspired by memes and Elon Musk tweets. My goal was to score a solid return and to have fun. I never was a big believer, so when the crypto market imploded in late 2022, I emptied my Robinhood account for good — or so I thought. In my mind, crypto was rife with fraud and grifters like Sam Bankman-Fried and Alex Mashinsky. I interviewed Mashinsky in 2021, years before his arrest and guilty plea to fraud. He criticized the financial system and said people "couldn't explain to you what's happening, but they know that something's broken." Ironically, that's exactly how I felt when I heard Mashinsky promising massive, risk-free yields. Though I haven't covered crypto in years, I made an exception to attend Anthony Pompliano's bitcoin conference on February 27. I spoke with dozens of bitcoin fanatics, and while I'm still not drinking the orange Kool-Aid, their enthusiasm convinced me to reconsider my cynicism. I arrived at the conference ready to learn, and to take the crypto community's pulse. Bitcoin had fallen about 25% from its all-time high above $109,000, and I wanted to see whether anyone's heart had skipped a beat. A clear consensus quickly formed: bitcoiners couldn't care less about this sell-off. Throughout my conversations, bitcoin's plunging price didn't come up unless I brought it up. One man named Ryan, who's plotting a move from tech to crypto and didn't give a last name, said he obsessed over bitcoin's price moves a few years ago. Now, he said he's no longer fazed by bear markets — even though he estimated 50% to 60% of his net worth in crypto. The hot crypto job market isn't cooling either, he said. Many others are also running toward the crypto industry, even as some investors bail. They're coming from stable fields like finance, unconcerned by what many may see as a risk. Their primary goal during the conference was to network, and maybe meet the next Vitalik Buterin. Some attendees were primarily there to learn, including bright-eyed college students and retired professors. With luck, their tickets will be small investments relative to their bitcoin holdings. One enthusiastic bitcoiner was Peter Giammanco, a crypto startup cofounder who was once wary of the "libertarian types" who hawked bitcoin. The skeptic changed his tune in 2019 and is now a crypto evangelist. His parents and siblings are on board, and he hopes his cousins are next. Some of my conversations abated as speakers took the stage, where they extolled the virtues of everything from crypto mining under Trump 2.0 to bitcoin-backed life insurance policies. However, I learned most from mingling in the foyer, where I spent much of the day. On occasion, I'd ask bitcoin fanatics the questions at the root of my skepticism: What is bitcoin worth, and if there's no clear way to value it, how can I be sure that it's a worthy investment? For most of my career, I've written about stocks. Investors often disagree about what companies are worth, which is why stocks move, but everyone in markets knows equities' primary value comes from the cash they produce now, issued in the form of dividends, or their future profits. By contrast, bitcoin doesn't create anything, nor is it tangible like gold or other commodities. But that doesn't make it worthless; on the contrary, bitcoin has several clear advantages over other cryptos and even traditional fiat currencies. Bitcoin's supply is limited, unlike most cryptos and the US dollar — which has been devalued by inflation and rampant money-printing. It also runs on an ultra-secure, pseudonymous network where there's both transaction transparency and privacy since wallets aren't tied to names. I appreciate the value of bitcoin's network, especially for those without viable banking systems, and can see why its proponents see it as a crucial store of value as the dollar gets devalued. However, as I told several bitcoin gurus, it's hard for me to buy bitcoin since it can't be valued by traditional metrics. Who's to say whether it should sell for $5,000, $10,000, or $510,000? No one seemed to mind my doubts, and one attendee thanked me for making an effort to learn. The bitcoiners agreed that there's no reliable way to intrinsically value the asset, though their confidence isn't tied to a mathematical formula of fair value. Instead, bitcoin fans' bull case centers on the ECON 101 principles of supply and demand. Bitcoin's supply is capped at 21 million. Close to 20 million units are already in circulation, including several million that may be unrecoverable. And demand is steadily rising, including from asset management giants like Fidelity and BlackRock, which just put a bitcoin ETF in its model portfolio for the first time. Companies are also adding bitcoin to their balance sheets, even if few are going to the extremes of MicroStrategy. Crucially, the Trump administration is also enamored with crypto, and there's even been talk about building a strategic bitcoin reserve. Essentially, the thinking is that bitcoin will appreciate as supply steadily shrinks unless demand dries up. And all indications are that interest is growing, especially as major players buy in. While I'm not completely sold yet, I did fire up my Robinhood app and place a limit order for $300 worth of bitcoin at a price of $81,000. If, or when, the transaction goes through, I'll hold for at least six months so I follow our company trading policy. I had few expectations when I arrived at the bitcoin conference. But although I was an outsider who didn't own crypto or work in the industry, everyone was very kind and respectful. I can see why some seem to value the crypto community almost as much as the digital asset itself. When I left, I'm glad I consumed more than just a pair of iced lattes and happy-hour margaritas. I came away with a better knowledge of crypto and the fast-growing world that's propping it up. As for whether I left with an idea for a winning investment, I'm just keeping my fingers crossed.

Title: Feuz: Court decision hurts America’s economic growth

President Trump’s promises to cut taxes, reduce regulations and promote “America First” economic policies excite many who think economic growth will result. Unfortunately, that agenda could be undermined by judges who pursue politics instead of calling balls and strikes from the bench.That’s what Texas District Court Judge Reed O’Connor did when he ruled that American Airlines violated its fiduciary duty by including BlackRock-managed funds in its 401(k) plan, given the asset manager’s broader corporate engagement with environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. While many conservatives oppose ESG, this case had nothing to do with it because no such funds were involved in American’s decision. O’Connor’s ruling assumes American Airlines is guilty because it dared associate with a company that has practices O’Connor doesn’t like.This means that businesses can be penalized not just for their direct actions but for the perceived intentions or broader activities of their partners and service providers. This could lead to increased litigation risk and uncertainty for all businesses because the ruling seems to depart from legal and financial prudence, undercutting established investment practices and the ability for employers to sponsor retirement plans with the best fund choices for their employees’ needs.Furthermore, the ruling inadvertently undermines American’s workforce efforts to prepare for a financially secure retirement. The decision casts doubt on the ability to use low-cost index funds and other popular types of funds in 401(k) plans, potentially limiting the options available to plan fiduciaries in seeking the best returns for retirees. This affects not only large corporations like American Airlines but also small businesses that manage their retirement plans under the same legal principles.Looking at the macroeconomic picture, reigniting the American economy hinges on the stability and growth of business. Businesses are the backbone of our economy, responsible for employment and innovation. And 401(k)s are essential to Americans’ financial security. Yet, rulings like this could stifle their recovery and growth by creating an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty around investment and partnership decisions. Imagine if no one had access to a 401(k) at work because of the liability it puts on employers.The reality is that O’Connor’s ruling ignores the myriad investor protections already in federal law and regulation, including those that stem from the fiduciary duty requirements under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.Policymakers and the legal community must consider the broader economic effects of judges, regardless of their preferred politics. Conservatives should question why O’Connor put his politics ahead of a consistent, predictable regulatory environment that will unleash economic growth and opportunity.

Skip to comments. Posted on 02/28/2025 8:48:19 PM PST by Kazan The European Union’s top diplomat Kaja Kallas, a legend in international diplomacy (kidding), lashed out at President Trump after Volodymyr Zelensky’s disgraceful and rude display on Friday in the Trump White House.Earlier today, ungrateful Ukrainian President Zelensky waltzed into the Trump White House and treated President Trump and the American people with total disdain.President Trump ended the talks after several minutes due to Zelensky’s rude behavior.Secretary of State Marco Rubio and NSA advisor Michael Waltz then went into the Roosevelt Room to ask Zelenskyy to leave, Rubio made it clear that any further engagements today would be counterproductive. Waltz told Zelenskyy he had made a tremendous mistake, and it was a grave disservice to Ukraine and to Americans.It is the first time a US President kicked out a world leader from the White House in recent memory.Following this horrible display, the EU’s top diplomat Kaja Kallas tweeted out that we need “a new leader of the free world.”Ukraine is Europe! We stand by Ukraine.We will step up our support to Ukraine so that they can continue to fight back the agressor.Today, it became clear that the free world needs a new leader. It’s up to us, Europeans, to take this challenge.— Kaja Kallas (@kajakallas) February 28, 2025Kaja wants the EU to take up this world leadership position – and if you disagree with her the EU will arrest you and threaten you at your home!Or, was this just a direct threat against President Trump?This isn’t the first time Kallas has attacked President Trump.RT reported:Kallas previously accused Trump of adopting “Russian narratives and talking points” about the Ukraine conflict, and expressed concern over what she described as Washington’s shift away from its longtime European allies.She also pushed back against criticisms of democracy in the EU made by Vice President Vance at the Munich Security Conference – remarks that Trump praised as “brilliant.” “I refuse to accept that criticism, because it’s just simply not true,” Kallas said.In recent weeks, Trump has made several critical statements about Ukraine’s leadership, describing Zelensky as a “dictator without elections” and suggesting that Kiev bears responsibility for allowing hostilities to escalate in 2022.

Waltz told Zelenskyy he had made a tremendous mistake, and it was a grave disservice to Ukraine and to Americans.It is the first time a US President kicked out a world leader from the White House in recent memory.Following this horrible display, the EU’s top diplomat Kaja Kallas tweeted out that we need “a new leader of the free world.”Ukraine is Europe! We stand by Ukraine.We will step up our support to Ukraine so that they can continue to fight back the agressor.Today, it became clear that the free world needs a new leader. It’s up to us, Europeans, to take this challenge.— Kaja Kallas (@kajakallas) February 28, 2025Kaja wants the EU to take up this world leadership position – and if you disagree with her the EU will arrest you and threaten you at your home!Or, was this just a direct threat against President Trump?This isn’t the first time Kallas has attacked President Trump.RT reported:Kallas previously accused Trump of adopting “Russian narratives and talking points” about the Ukraine conflict, and expressed concern over what she described as Washington’s shift away from its longtime European allies.She also pushed back against criticisms of democracy in the EU made by Vice President Vance at the Munich Security Conference – remarks that Trump praised as “brilliant.” “I refuse to accept that criticism, because it’s just simply not true,” Kallas said.In recent weeks, Trump has made several critical statements about Ukraine’s leadership, describing Zelensky as a “dictator without elections” and suggesting that Kiev bears responsibility for allowing hostilities to escalate in 2022.

We stand by Ukraine.We will step up our support to Ukraine so that they can continue to fight back the agressor.Today, it became clear that the free world needs a new leader.

The Season of Discovery versions of the original Darkmoon Cards are now obtainable from their quests. Songflower Lullaby, Dark Fortune of Damage, and Blessing of Neptulon will no longer cancel when entering instances. Players can now go into Blackwing Lair and change any Tier 2 items with Tier 1 set bonuses back into the Tier 2 item with Tier 2 set bonuses. Draught of the Sands for Hunters and Rogues will no longer erroneously stack under certain conditions.

Title: Bitcoin Crashes, But Standard Chartered Sees $200,000 In 2025
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-crash-standard-chartered-200000-in-2025/
Time Published: 2025-03-01T01:00:14Z

In an interview with CNBC’s Street Signs on February 27, Geoffrey Kendrick, Head of Digital Asset Research at Standard Chartered, offered insights on Bitcoin’s recent price decline and laid out a bold forecast for the world’s largest cryptocurrency. Despite near-term volatility, Kendrick expects Bitcoin to reach $200,000 this year and as high as $500,000 before the end of President Trump’s term. Kendrick opened the discussion by noting the influence of political developments on investor sentiment: “So I think the Trump Administration will be positive medium term. So we came into January 20, hoping for quite a lot and you could argue there was already quite a lot of positivity priced in.” He highlighted the immediate post-inauguration shift in regulatory stance—specifically, the removal of SAB 121, which he described as having “been hampering financial institutions.” Kendrick also addressed the lack of a widely anticipated strategic Bitcoin reserve, replaced instead by a “stockpile” approach. According to Kendrick: “The stockpile for me is okay because it legitimizes other sovereigns […] both within the US [and outside]. A number of US states are considering holding Bitcoin on their balance sheet.” Still, markets have been rattled by fresh uncertainties. Kendrick pointed to ongoing trade war and geopolitical flashpoints: “Initiatives in the last couple of weeks have been very confusing for risk assets […] tariffs on and off. Canada, Mexico, EU […] obviously some potential positives coming around Ukraine and or the Middle East but nothing solid really on any of those and risk assets don’t like uncertainty.” Within the crypto sphere specifically, he cited the Bybit hack, trouble with the Solana meme coin scams, and a generally “confusing” environment as contributors to the pullback. Kendrick underscored the cascading effect on Bitcoin. When asked whether Bitcoin remains a genuine diversifier amid its correlation with equities, Kendrick maintained a nuanced view: “Certainly when we see large moves like we’ve seen in the last few weeks […] on the negative direction risk assets all trade together […] Medium-term, I think the diversification story is reasonable […] The use case for Bitcoin in particular is to diversify against risks around traditional financial markets.” Kendrick also addressed the large outflows from the spot ETFs since Trump’s inauguration: “Even in the last week, we’ve seen about $3 billion of outflows in terms of ETFs […] we got to a net position of about $40 billion of inflows over the first 12 months of those ETFs in the US […] but in the last week or so we’ve seen $3 billion of outflows.” He estimates that those who bought Bitcoin post-election in November are now “heavily underwater” to the tune of $2 billion in paper losses. This newer cohort of holders, combined with the sector’s still-robust retail participation, has amplified volatility: “It’s much more difficult for investors then to hold through losses […] when you see moves like we saw this week, you tend to get some panic selling.” He also reiterated the need for deeper institutional participation—citing banks like Standard Chartered and investment giants such as BlackRock—to improve custody solutions and reduce the frequency of such hacks like the Bybit one, leading to damaging headlines: “As the industry becomes more institutionalized it should be safer […] hopefully we get some regulatory clarity in the US too […] that should add to that medium-term top side potential which for me is Bitcoin up to $200,000 this year and $500,000 before Trump leaves office.” Looking ahead, Kendrick underscored that regulatory clarity—particularly around stablecoin rules and KYC—could trigger a wave of institutional and even sovereign capital inflows. He identified long-term public pension funds and sovereign wealth funds as pivotal market movers, referencing the Abu Dhabi Sovereign Wealth Fund’s purchase of 4,700 BTC-equivalent shares in the BlackRock ETF at the end of 2024: “There’s that very long-term sector that is still to participate more […] and then also Sovereign so the only Sovereign that we know so far has bought the ETFs is Abu Sovereign wealth fund […] I’d expect more of that to come through this year as well.” At press time, BTC traded at $81,428.

Title: Who are the 32 politicians in the Dáil who declared themselves as landlords last year?

THIRTY-TWO POLITICIANS in the Dáil have declared that they rented out property or land last year. Five TDs also declared an income from contracts with the Department of Integration for housing asylum seekers or refugees or with local authorities for renting a property to someone receiving the Housing Assistance Payment. Another TD also said their spouse owned a property that had a contract with the Department of Integration. The latest edition of the Dáil register of interests, published this week, contains an updated list of TDs who are legally obliged to declare their income from land or property. Under ethics legislation, all TDs and Senators are required to declare any land or properties they own – aside from their family home – as well as any source of income over €2,600 that is derived from a source other than their political office. The information is published annually on the Dáil and Seanad registers of interest, though representatives can make retroactive additions for specific years at any time if they discover that they did not complete the annual return for a given year accurately. According to last year’s annual return, 31 TDs derived an income from being a landlord last year – as did 31 in 2023 (before additional interests were declared for that year). This year’s 32 landlord TDs include 11 deputies from Fianna Fáil, ten from Fine Gael, four from Sinn Féin, one Social Democrats TD and six independents. The TDs listed as landlords for 2024 were: Cathy Bennett (SF); Colm Burke (FF); Joanna Byrne (SF); Thomas Byrne (FF); Seán Canney (Ind); Micheál Carrigy (FG); Joe Cooney (FG); Emer Currie (FG); Pa Daly (SF); Alan Dillon (FG); Timmy Dooley (FF); Frank Feighan (FG); Sinéad Gibney (SD); Paul Gogarty (Ind); Noel Grealish (Ind); Johnny Guirke (SF); Michael Healy-Rae (Ind); Martin Heydon (FG); James Lawless (FF); Charlie McConalogue (FF); Tony McCormack (FF); Aindrias Moynihan (FF); Michael Moynihan (FF); Carol Nolan (Ind); Seán Ó Fearghaíl (FF); Peter Roche (FG); Eamon Scanlon (FF); Brendan Smith (FF); Edward Timmons (FG); Gillian Toole (Ind); Robert Troy (FF); and Barry Ward (FG). Another 29 TDs also declared that they owned land or some other property, aside from their principle residence (though in a small number of cases, this land was earmarked for a future family home). Sinn Féin’s Cathy Bennett declared herself as landlord of a rental property at Canal View in Co Monaghan – for which she received money under the Government’s Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) – and also listed ownership of a holiday home in Co Donegal. Colm Burke, a Fine Gael TD and qualified solicitor, declared rental income from his former practice’s office on Washington Street in Cork, which he lets to the Cork City Sheriff and to three other solicitors. Sinn Féin TD Joanna Byrne listed herself as landlord of a property in Pearse Park in Drogheda, Co Louth. Fianna Fáil’s Thomas Byrne declared a rental income from a property in Rossnowlagh in Donegal.

Joe Cooney of Fine Gael declared ownership of rental properties in Scariff and Newmarket-on-Fergus in Co Clare, though he did declare himself a landlord, suggesting he made less than €2,600 from these last year. Fine Gael’s Emer Currie declared ownership of a rental property at Mount Bellew Crescent in Lucan, Co Dublin. Pa Daly of Sinn Féin declared ownership of a property in Rock Street, Co Kerry and listed income from a contract with the Department of Integration for provision of accommodation.

Frank Feighan, a Fine Gael TD, declared himself a landlord for ownership of a newsagents, from which he derives an income of €400 a month. Social Democrats TD Sinéad Gibney declared that she rents out a property in Blackrock, Co Dublin, though she noted that this is the only residence she owns; she says she rents her own accommodation and did not list her occupation as a landlord. Paul Gogarty, an independent TD, declared an income from part-time rental of a holiday home that he part owns in Killala, Co Mayo. Another independent TD, Noel Grealish, listed income from a house he rents in Claregalway, Co Galway, as well as ownership of an apartment in Dublin which is declared for personal use. Sinn Féin TD Johnny Guirke declared himself a landlord of two properties: one located in Oldcastle Co Meath and another located in Tuam. Independent Michael Healy-Rae, often described as the Dáil’s biggest landlord, declared himself as the owner of almost 30 properties or pieces of land, including houses he owned for rental purposes; he also declared contracts with the Department of Integration for accommodating Ukrainian refugees and a HAP contract with Kerry County Council. Fine Gael TD Martin Heydon listed himself as the lessor of farmlands at Blackrath in Co Kildare and Aghcross in Co Laois.

Independent TD Carol Nolan declared herself as a landlord with income from a two-bed cottage in Birr, Co Offaly, which she joint owns with her husband. Former Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl, a Fianna Fáil TD, said he rents out a property in Fennor and derives income from a HAP contract, and also declared ownership of farmland at Fennor and Shanacloon and a constituency office in Athy, Co Kildare. Advertisement Fine Gael’s Peter Roche did not declare income as a landlord, but said he owns a two-bed cottage and farmland next to his private home (without disclosing where this is), which is rented under the HAP scheme with Galway County Council; he also declared ownership of additional farmland in Tuam. Eamon Scanlon, a Fianna Fáil TD, declared income from 5 apartments in Sligo, as well as ownership of 27 acres of farmland in Ballymote. Another Fianna Fáil TD, Brendan Smith, said he received an income from renting an apartment in Dublin. Fine Gael TD Edward Timmins also received an income from a property on Dublin’s North Circular Road, two properties in Germany, and an apartment in France; he also owns agriculatural land in Wicklow. Gillian Toole, and independent TD from Meath, declared an income from a post office and another property in Dunshaughlin, and five further properties in Navan, Lucan and Dublin 15; she also declared ownership of more land in Navan and Ratoath. Fianna Fáil’s Robert Troy declared income from eight properties in Phibsborough in Dublin, and Mullingar and Ballynacargy in Westmeath. And Fine Gael TD Barry Ward said he derives an income from an apartment at The Gasworks in Dublin 4. Another 29 TDs who did not list themselves as landlords also declared ownership of second homes or multiple pieces of land.

Catherine Ardagh, a newly elected Fianna Fáil TD, declared ownership of a holiday home in Ballyshannon, Co Donegal.

The world's largest asset manager is adding a 1% to 2% IBIT share to its target allotment for Target Allocation with Alternatives and the Target Allocation with Alternatives Tax-Aware portfolios, which are aimed at investors with higher risk tolerance. "Target Allocation with Alternatives models invest across a full risk spectrum, and allocate to a core allocation of stocks and bonds plus liquid alternative investments," a BlackRock spokesperson wrote in an email to Decrypt. "The addition of IBIT to these portfolios as a diversifier are in line with the investment objectives of this model, as Target Allocation with Alternatives portfolios are designed for investors with a higher risk budget and growth target." The additions affected a small part of BlackRock's Target Allocation with Alternatives portfolios, the spokesperson said. Still, the fund could spur fresh demand for the ETF. It also reflects traditional finance's widening embrace of crypto assets, stemming from markets increased demand for these products. Model portfolios offering prefabricated strategies for financial advisors have been soaring in recent years. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink had been among crypto skeptics in the past, but has since become more upbeat about Bitcoin. "It’s another step towards bringing Bitcoin into the investment mainstream," ETF.com Analyst Sumit Roy wrote in a text to Decrypt. "IBIT was already a resounding success—this move could boost demand for the fund further." IBIT, which debuted in January 2024 along with nine other Bitcoin-tracking funds (an 11th fund started trading later in the year), reached $60 million assets under management faster than any other ETF in the industry's 32-year history. It has shed more than $1 billion in assets over the past seven trading days amid a downturn in crypto markets stemming from market unrest over spikes in inflation and other macroeconomic uncertainties. The fund still holds about three times the assets under management as its largest rivals. Spot Bitcoin funds collectively have about $90 billion in AUM, even after hemorrhaging more than $2.4 billion worth over the past seven trading days. Bitcoin was recently trading above $84,000, up about 8% from an overnight low under $79,000, but well off its all-time high of over $108,000 set in mid January. It has fallen 13% during the past month. ETF.com's Roy said that demand for IBIT resulting from the model portfolio changes was unclear. "The actual incremental inflows for IBIT could be... in the millions rather than billions," Roy said. In other words, at least in the near-term, this move may be more of symbolic significance than a needle-mover on flows.

Title: AIL preview: Clontarf in the driver’s seat as they make trip to Terenure

Terenure host Clontarf at Lakelands Park in a reprise of the Energia All-Ireland League finals of 2022 and 2023 with the stakes as high as they’ve been for most of their 10 meetings over the past three seasons. With just four rounds remaining, Terenure sit fourth on 47 points, a point behind neighbours Clontarf and champions Cork Con, the former leading the table on 52 points. And, as is usually the case when two sides become overly familiar, there is not much love lost between this pair. The home side have been boosted by the return of Leinster academy duo outhalf Caspar Gabriel and winger Henry McErlean, while Clontarf’s influential prop Ivan Soroka has been called up by Leo Cullen for his prospective Leinster debut off the bench for their URC game against Cardiff. In what is also Terenure’s third annual charity match in aid of Childline and the Children’s Health Foundation, somewhat typical of a wildly unpredictable Division 1A, the home side won 28-10 at Castle Avenue in round four, with Jordan Coughlan in inspired form against his one-time club. Yet on a line through recent meetings with City of Armagh, a vengeful Clontarf would be strong favourites, having won 41-7 away to the Ulster side a week ago in their rearranged match in hand to return to the top of the table, while Terenure lost there a week previously. Con host Lansdowne, who like Ballynahinch sit just six points off the play-offs and remain very much in the picture, in another hugely significant clash. Lansdowne beat Con 27-10 earlier this season, albeit Con’s nine-game unbeaten run came to an end with a dramatic 15-13 loss in Clontarf a fortnight ago. Harry O’Riordan, part of Con’s AIL-winning team last season, is on the bench for Lansdowne. Bobby Sheehan reverts to hooker in a strong-looking UCD team, which also features Ben Brownlee and Ruben Moloney, sitting in the relegation play-off spot. They host City of Armagh, who are seven points above them, in a pivotal tussle in Belfield. Saturday, 2.30pm kick-off (unless stated) Men’s Division 1A: Ballynahinch v Young Munster, Ballymacarn Park; Cork Constitution v Lansdowne, Temple Hill (Live on IrishRugby+); Garryowen v St Mary’s College, Dooradoyle; Terenure College v Clontarf, Lakelands; UCD v City of Armagh, Belfield. Division 1B: Highfield v Blackrock College, Woodleigh Park; Old Belvedere v Nenagh Ormond, Ollie Campbell Park; Old Wesley v Naas, Energia Park; Queens v Dublin University, Dub Lane; Shannon v UCC, Thomond Park. Division 2A: Ballymena v Cashel, Eaton Park; Buccaneers v Banbrdige, Dubarry Park; Greystones v MU Barnhall, Dr Hickey Park; Navan v Instonians, Balreask Old; Old Crescent v Galway Corinthians, Takumi Park. Division 2B: UL Bohemian v Clogher Valley, Annacotty (1.30pm); Dunagnnon v Rainey, Stevenson Park; Galwegians v Wanderers, Crowley Park; Malahide v Skerries, Estuary Road; Malone v Sligo, Hamilton Park. Division 2C: Bruff v Ballyclare, Kilballyowen Park; Clonmel v Monkstown, Ardgaoithe; Midleton v Enniscorthy, Towns Park; Omagh Academicals v Belfast Harlequins, Thomas Mellon Playing Fields; Tullamore v Dolphin, Spollanstown. Women’s Division (all matches Saturday, 5pm): Blackrock College v Wicklow, Stradbrook; Old Belvedere v Ballincollig, Ollie Campbell Park; Suttonians v Railway Union, JJ McDowell Memorial Grounds; Tullow v Galwegians, The Black Gates; UL Bohemian v Cooke, UL4G.

Title: BlackRock Shifts Away from DEI Policies After President Donald Trump Signs Executive Order

Asset manager BlackRock is backing away from diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies as President Donald Trump’s administration fights such initiatives. BlackRock’s leaders explained the shift and where the company is headed, Fox Business reported Friday. “‘Delivering for clients requires attracting the best people from across the world,’ BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said in a memo to employees Friday morning in a letter also signed by the asset management giant’s President Robert Kapito and Global Head of Human Resources Caroline Heller,” the outlet stated. The company’s leadership said they want to continue creating a culture that is open to diverse individuals and perspectives: The email goes on to discuss the recent number of “significant changes to the U.S. legal and policy environment related to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) that apply to many companies, including BlackRock.” … The top executives explained that they will not be renewing their representation goals in the workforce that expired in 2024, while pointing out that the company will continue “welcoming diverse talent” worldwide without requiring managers to interview a diverse roster of candidates for open positions. BlackRock will be merging its Talent Management and DEI teams to create a global Talent and Culture team. WATCH — President Trump Signs Multiple Executive Orders in Front of Cheering Crowd: On the BlackRock website, its careers page titled “Our Global Talent & Culture” said: We believe that maintaining a strong corporate culture is an important component of our human capital management practices and critical to our long-term success. Our culture is underpinned by five core principles that unify our workforce and guide how we interact with our employees, our clients, the communities in which we operate and our other stakeholders: (1) We are a fiduciary to our clients; (2) We are One BlackRock (1BLK); (3) We are passionate about performance; (4) We take emotional ownership; and (5) We are committed to a better future. The recent news about BlackRock comes after Trump signed an executive order telling federal agencies to look into corporate DEI programs that could possibly be in violation of civil rights laws, the Fox report said. The order that was signed on January 21 read: Illegal DEI and DEIA policies not only violate the text and spirit of our longstanding Federal civil-rights laws, they also undermine our national unity, as they deny, discredit, and undermine the traditional American values of hard work, excellence, and individual achievement in favor of an unlawful, corrosive, and pernicious identity-based spoils system. Hardworking Americans who deserve a shot at the American Dream should not be stigmatized, demeaned, or shut out of opportunities because of their race or sex. … The Federal Government is charged with enforcing our civil-rights laws. The purpose of this order is to ensure that it does so by ending illegal preferences and discrimination. In Wednesday’s Breitbart Business Digest, the outlet’s John Carney wrote, “A dramatic and decisive shift is sweeping through corporate America, as diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives crumble in the face of legal scrutiny, economic reality, and shifting public sentiment.” “What was once considered the inevitable march of corporate progressivism is now being reversed with stunning speed,” he added. A recent survey from Cygnal found that most Americans believe government hires should be based on merit and experience, a finding that goes against DEI efforts, per Breitbart News.

Title: BlackRock adds Bitcoin exposure to model portfolio via IBIT

The asset manager allocated 1% to 2% in Bitcoin through its IBIT exchange-traded fund. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock incorporated Bitcoin (BTC) into its $150 billion model-portfolio offerings through its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) exchange-traded fund (ETF), Bloomberg News reported on Feb. 28. The asset manager has assigned 1% to 2% of its target allocation portfolios to IBIT. As of Dec. 17, the fund registered over $36 billion in net flows, amassing more inflows than any ETF launched since 2014. According to the report, Bitcoin’s inherent volatility prompted BlackRock, in a December report from the BlackRock Investment Institute, to define a 1% to 2% allocation as a “reasonable range.” The document noted that exceeding a 2% allocation could disproportionately increase the cryptocurrency’s impact on overall portfolio risk. Michael Gates, lead portfolio manager for BlackRock’s Target Allocation ETF model portfolio suite, stated: “We believe Bitcoin has long-term investment merit and can potentially provide unique and additive sources of diversification to portfolios.” Additionally, Eve Cout, head of portfolio design and solutions for US Wealth at BlackRock, noted that investors want to allocate more to alternatives. Still, they need guidance on the position’s size, scale, and rebalance. The decision comes amid IBIT registering $930 million in outflows in the past four days. On Feb. 26, BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF experienced its largest daily outflow, with $418 million in capital leaving the fund. Despite the recent woes, IBIT currently holds over $48 billion in assets and displays nearly $40 billion in net flows per data from Bold Report and Farside Investors. Notably, the firm doubled its Bitcoin exposure in its Global Allocation Fund last year, reporting 430,770 shares of IBIT in its third-quarter 13F Form. The amount was 117% larger than the 198,874 shares reported for the second quarter. BlackRock’s addition of Bitcoin to its model portfolio is a much-needed positive development that could boost market sentiment amid falling prices.

Syndemics Lambert here: Many readers have commented on how helpful they found the Covid section. Let my repeat my belief: Assume for now that airborne disease will be a constant going forward, by Rule #2. (Covid, measles, maybe bird flu, the usual suspects like TB, RSV, etc.) Devise your airborne protection protocol according to the Swiss Cheese Model and stick to it. Don’t be thinking all the time and adjusting your behavior, not least because there will be at least a two week lag time between the next pandemic getting rolling and you hearing about it in the news. The K.I.S.S. principle applies. Covid coverage at Naked Capitalism will continue, but neither the list of Covid resources nor the Daily Covid charts will continue; they are too complex to maintain. (For a good weekly Covid wrapup, check out the Threat Model blog with Violet Blue.) I was especially pleased and proud of the collective responsibility readers took on for each other by aggregating and then maintaining the Covid Resources listings, immediately below. If some kind reader with a blog wants me to send them the HTML code, so they can carry on the work, send me mail. Finally, I was not “HEARD” as Garrison was, very sadly. I feel that I did help out readers, and I did inspire part of a lawsuit against HICPAC’s Inspector General. Five years of charts, and the only conclusion is that anybody who tells you that Covid has gone away is deluded or shamelessly lying…. “I am in earnest — I will not equivocate — I will not excuse — I will not retreat a single inch — AND I WILL BE HEARD.” –William Lloyd Garrison * * * Covid Resources, United States (National): Transmission (CDC); Wastewater (CDC, Biobot; includes many counties; Wastewater Scan, includes drilldown by zip); Variants (CDC; Walgreens); “Iowa COVID-19 Tracker” (in IA, but national data). “Infection Control, Emergency Management, Safety, and General Thoughts” (especially on hospitalization by city).

No. Turns out, there’s data behind this phenomenon. New research shows that young conservative women are much happier than liberal women. The findings are about far more than political ideology. They demonstrate fundamental differences between Republicans and Democrats. According to the 2024 American Family Survey, liberal women ages 18-40 are far less likely than conservative women to say they are happy. Only 12% of liberal women said they are “completely satisfied” with life compared with 37% of conservative women. Self-described moderates also are happier than liberals, with 28% agreeing that they are fully satisfied with life. Grant Bailey, a research associate of the Institute for Family Studies, and Brad Wilcox, a senior fellow at the institute, investigated “how marriage, churchgoing, and loneliness help to account for the happiness gap between liberal and conservative women.” Bailey and Wilcox make a strong case that conservative women are happier because they make different life choices. They are more likely to get married, have babies and embrace a strong faith − all things that make them feel less lonely. And people who don’t feel lonely are more likely to be happy.” • Hmm. “A History of Violence” [BookForum].

Thank you! Readers, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism (“Because markets”). I don’t much care about the “ism” that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don’t much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue — and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me — is the tens of thousands of excess “deaths from despair,” as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics — even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton’s wars created — bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow — currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press — a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let’s call such voices “the left.” Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn’t allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I’ve been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it. I feel like that English personage who delighted in a leisurely read through the entire Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire and then asked, “Is there no more Gibbon?” There are always more Gibbons. But I know what you mean. Thanks for everything, Lambert! Dearest Lambert Please do not leave! Someone has put rum in the punchbowl and the party is starting to seethe……. Happy trails, Lambert. Yes, fair the well! 402…nope, make that 403. Best wishes on your new endeavors. I’d hoped to have time to write a farewell song parody for the Water Cooler, but nope. Maybe later For now, as Douglas Adams wrote, so long and thanks for all the fish. :) Lambert we who are reading our last Water Cooler salute you and say thanks for being such a great host over the years.

That’s progress… I just posted this below too. My initial thoughts are Zelensky was high on something, his own supply and maybe coke too. I can’t imagine walking into a meeting like that and arguing in that venue unless your senses were clouded by drugs. This may be the best gift for Trump though. He has a good excuse to back out of any future agreements with Ukraine. I guess we’ll see if he takes that opportunity or not. Cocaine is a helluva drug! see Z’s fidgeting, nose tweaking, agitation….Z was tweaking. Citation: and having partaked (a bit) and being around it in my early 20’s, lol And I bet (tea-totalling) Trump’s been around tweakers a lot too over the decades, and knows the signs from across the room. And likely doubly offended at Z’s imbibing. Zelensky has gotten accustomed to many of his pleas and convincing appeals to US government leadership ( Biden, Blinken, Sullivan, etc…) that the new bosses are for real, and just not in the BAU mode of operations… No longer is it Business as Usual, or standard procedure to have your refill of countless millions and billions. Reminding me of a hard tack in foreign policy approach, not necessarily a bad shift. We got problems closer to home, fighting a never ending overseas conflict or even just merely playing the role of Big Daddy War money I believe has, or had already, begun to grate on American citizens. Trump can be a blunt tool in such affairs and in his negotiating tactics. No kidding. The image of Ukrainian Ambassador Oksana Markarova with her head in her hands pretty much sums up how this went. I can picture Joe Biden, watching that video while sitting in a nursing home in a wheel chair like Hector Salamanca from “Breaking Bad.” Spittle and foam forming at his mouth, while he watches his entire legacy go down the drain. Unable to speak due to a stroke. https://breakingbad.fandom.com/wiki/Hector_Salamanca That was a very funny comment! It is a funny comment. But the blackest of black comedy given the half-million-plus human lives flushed down the toilet in this incredibly stupid war. “Ding ding ding ding ding ding” Actually the Dems are probably very happy about this – now they can say “Ukraine would have won the war if WE were in power! Trump lost the war!!” And the fully propagandized public will buy it. IF Israel, just as Ukraine, requires US security guarantees and US weapons and US funds to pay it’s bureaucracy and guarantee it’s bonds to survive -and Ukraine must sign a resource extraction and infrastructure collateralization deal with the US to protect US Taxpayers’ interests to secure those security guarantees and weapons and funds; WHY is there no commensurate commitment demanded of Israel? If he (Biden) even remembers much about being president. Depends of the state of his decline, probably. The transcript is above. Vance escalated the conflict? Oof Laura, that’s a shallow slant, but anyway, yo Lambert, good on ya in all your metamorphoses! You’ve tangibly contributed to the self-education of many, myself included. May the last song from our admired ‘Combat Rock’ serve as the soundtrack of my tribute. Ginsberg may be passé, but this cut-up rug really tied that room together. https://youtu.be/GTLMgAuTNOI?si=UFuIVk0r42XCslE- wow. just wow. I’ve not seen anything like it. watching the “Rest is politics” live stream on it now. Alastair campbell reminding us that Trump is a not serious reality tv person. Interested in just two things, ratings and conflict. more evidence of the clown show in the oval office. Does the video of that encounter make you think Trump isn’t a serious person? He looks like Churchill next to Zelensky in that affair. I hope I don’t stray outside the guidelines after the latest comment ban. Going to be careful with my response. I can look at the video of that encounter with the sound off. What I see are 3 primates in a power display. The body language is not collaborative or healthy at all. Crossed arms from Zelenksy. (defensive), finger pointing from Trump and Vance (aggression). It’s a conflict situation. One of the primates is in good physical condition , the other two look ready for a long winter, one old, one young. the young is subservient to the old. Now if we replace 3 primates with “2 presidents and one vice president” then I expect very different behaviour. I would not expect such a nakedly obvious animal interaction. More type 2 thinking vs type 1 please. Lastly the comment at the end of “this will make great TV”. As a way to try and close out the encounter at the end? This trivializes one of the important political situations of our time. Unserious. This is going to go down very badly over here. people will be incredulous at the encounter. Staff will be working overtime on damage limitation. Curious why you draw the comparison with Churchill? (and as a Brit I know Churchill was very much of his time with his own problems) hazelbee; I can look at the video of that encounter with the sound off. What I see are 3 primates in a power display. What else would you expect? What else was all of this ever, from the start, but primate power competitions? Is it, maybe, actually better that the proles can see that that’s what the reality always has been? Indeed, however inelegant you may find Trump – and I too am a Brit, who after decades in the US is back in London to watch the equivalent of what I fully expect may be the equivalent of the Yeltsin years for the US — isn’t hearing Trump and Vance articulate out loud the actual stakes of what Zelensky is trying to get them to do, which is to have the US underwrite the continuance of this conflict on his terms rather than make peace, slightly refreshing? Each to their own taste, of course. But you say that this was ‘unserious.’ I, on the other hand, don’t like Trump and Vance, and liked Biden, Obama, Clinton, etcetera, even less, but I liked this. Because this was the truth. nice observation. and of course we—US, UK, the West—put Z in this position to begin with. Talk about a bait and switch… No, Zelensky and his Ukrainian backers put Zelensky in this position. I realize that this conflict was managed by grifters and ideological US bureaucrats wanting a proxy war with their real target, but none of them went to Zelensky and told the popular comic actor to run for his country’s Presidency. But even being a clueless entertainment figure, the precarious situation the country was in had to be clear to him before he did this. He ran knowing that the US was pulling the strings, actually ran on policy counter to what his administration did, and was the appropriate front man for the grifters in his country with the West. He may have gotten more than he expected. (It wouldn’t surprise me that he was deluded about what Russia could do as our ever failing foreign policy strategists were.) But once again he chose to jettison a successful career for this. I feel for many Ukrainians. I do not feel for Zelensky or the remaining Ukrainian legislature, or most of its top military, especially the Azov brigade. Not that most of the American government (and top Europeans) are any better. And while not keeping up the pretense that Ukraine as anything but lost in this is refreshing, throwing more money at it because of a ‘deal’ that Zelensky has no real legal right to make doesn’t make doesn’t give the latest home team any points either in my book. Consistent with earlier theory that Trump will take the minerals deal, reportedly inked by the Rada already, and work it with the Russians, Zelensky is boxed out and his authority hasn’t been reinforced or made significant. I have to wonder if this isn’t still kayfabe, because Zelensky’s defiance and expulsion will buy him some credibility with the Banderites who have guns to his head. Maybe he will make it to France. Strange for me to say so but in all fairness to Zelensky the guy is probably a mental train wreck right now. He has just signed his entire country over to the US for who knows how many generations and he knows full well that if it had not been for the US this war would never have even happened – and now the US is going to walk away with everything. Vance and Trump talk a lot about respect but I have noticed that for them the respect goes only one way. First Zelensky and Ukraine were slapped by the left hand of imperialism, and now they (and particularly Zelensky) have been slapped by the right hand of imperialism. The Archie slap from Guy Ritchie’s RocknRolla. More relevant than you might imagine. Rev Kev: (Zelensky) knows full well that if it had not been for the US this war would never have even happened – and now the US is going to walk away with everything. Sure. But when any country’s elites have actively sought to get into bed with Langley and indeed with DC, generally — after no less a personage than Henry Kissinger explained the score decades ago (recite after me, children: to be an enemy of the US is dangerous, but to be a friend is fatal) — that country’s elites are not wholesome, upstanding, and respectable. They are deeply corrupt. How did those thirty-plus US biolabs in Ukraine ringing Russian borders get there, for example? With the active connivance of Ukraine’s elites. And so on. Furthermore, the US is not going to “walk away with everything.” After this, the US’s credibility is almost certainly so deeply tarnished that even, for instance, the quisling elites in Europe are going to have a hard time selling out to it. Good. No. The minerals deal has not been signed. I think Z knew what he was doing going into this: putting on a show for the Europols, use their hatred of Trump to get them to put together a security guarantee without the USA. https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/02/24/nuclear-armed-ukraine/ or https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtY4MpoOQ1s How a nuclear-armed Ukraine could become ‘Europe’s Israel’ “On the third anniversary of the Russian invasion, Ukraine faces a dilemma over how to defend itself…….” I have not read the article or watched the youtube…. the thought of a nuclear armed Zelenski is repugnant to me ……… This project of, Ukraine as Europe’s Israel, sums up, imo, much of the last eleven years in the Ukraine. The Trump-Zelensky dust up is very welcome news imo. The Israel model pops up from time to time in the writings of the foreign policy think tank crowd. They want to do the same with the Kurds, too. These maniacs love Israel precisely for the exact reasons we hate the whole damned failed project. They want to recreate it throughout the world. Best wishes! Thanks for all the content! From the bottom of my heart, I thank you Lambert. I have learned from and been entertained by you for many years now. I will miss your posts and all the wit, intelligence, insight, critical commentary, snark and plain good writing they have encompassed. It does not surprise me at all that so many writers are required to fill those yellow waders of yours. I wish you all the best in retirement and your new endeavours. Farewell, may you live in peace. Intelligence, wit, good cheer, those have been Lambert’s trademarks. We will miss him, certainly. Thanks for everything, Lambert. Bon voyage! Fair winds and following seas, Lambert. We shall miss your sharp eyes at the masthead, Lambert. May we all steer clear of th’ impervious horrors of a lee shore. A fellow Aubrey/Maturin fan! (But surely “leeward”?) No one can turn a deadly venemous waspish insult like Stephen…. Here you go: https://www.edwardhopper.net/the-lee-shore.jsp Also, starting about two minutes in: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=YcZRyLO1Sh Cassandra the second youtube link is no more – can you help? Sorry about that, mary jensen. That was supposed to go to David Crosby singing Lee Shore at the Ace Hotel 7-3-2019, which seemed to me a nice valedictory. Here’s another try at sharing the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcZRyLO1Shc Also, venomous. Argh You will be missed, comrade. Learned a lot from you https://youtu.be/EfxDppZyOOc?si=_KTkI6Rz7P7CI9oS re: “when I’ve worked up a good head of spleen.” dry, very dry. / ;) It is a snowclone (I think that has already been a Word of the Day, but if not, here it is.) Thanks for all the years of insightful comment! Best wishes! What conservative women know − and liberals don’t − about happiness | Opinion The pursuit of happiness − a right outlined in the Declaration of Independence − can mean a lot of things. In 1776, the right to follow one’s own path toward happiness was foundational to liberty. Now, happiness is all that Americans want to pursue. And much of our culture is geared toward individual happiness in the moment Happiness is not meaning. The pursuit of happiness can make people perpetually miserable, because happiness depends on external circumstances – things you can’t control. Pursue contentment and meaning, which you can control, and accept happiness whenever it finds you. yeah, Nietzsche’s “define yer own good” is a hard row. i built a village, and now theres nobody here but me and my lunatic mom. so i had to modify the Good that i am still moving towards… now…well… my boys will need a refugia…. in the coming darkness. so this infrastructure remains important. > this infrastructure remains important 100% in agreement. i hung a 12′ sign on the side of my shop, right after we moved back out here: all i want for christmas is the means of production. one of many aphorisms and statements i sequestered on walls and among bushes so that my kids and their friends would notice them, and ask questions…leading to discussion and discourse. Amfortas, ever heard of Armand Schulthess? Collection de l’Art Brut Lausanne CH: https://www.artbrut.ch/en_GB/author/schulthess-armand “He embarked on the task of laying out his 18,000 m2 property with a network of paths, bridges, stairways and ladders. From the trees, by means of wire, he hung hundreds of metal plaques made from the tops or bases of food tins, which he coated with paint and inscribed with messages. The texts, written in five languages, combine knowledge relating to geology, astrology, psychoanalysis, literature and music, among other subjects.” For years I hung on to a house much too big for me, occasionally renting rooms. Then my long gone son moved back in, worked locally, got married and had two kids that now all live with me. Yeah, based on my good fortune, I’d say keep the infrastructure both within and without in good working order. I have heard that in college that liberal girls tend to hook up with conservative guys more than liberal guys. Make of that what you will. The oft quoted part of Robert Frost’s Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening won’t quit my mind. In it’s entirety: Whose woods these are I think I know. His house is in the village though; He will not see me stopping here To watch his woods fill up with snow. My little horse must think it queer To stop without a farmhouse near Between the woods and frozen lake The darkest evening of the year. He gives his harness bells a shake To ask if there is some mistake. The only other sound’s the sweep Of easy wind and downy flake. The woods are lovely, dark and deep, But I have promises to keep, And miles to go before I sleep, And miles to go before I sleep. Perhaps one snowy evening we all will meet again. Bon voyage. Set to music by Randall Thompson, as one of seven poems that make up the suite Frostiana: Seven Country Songs. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bUzZmoIRA Thanks for the past decade plus that I’ve been reading these! Also, it’s been 3 years (Jan 2022) since I last asked, so as we enter Pandemic year 6 I’m again looking for TV show recommendations; I’m currently rewatching all of Stargate SG1 (I never watched the last 2 seasons) and Stargate Atlantis (never saw the last 3 seasons). That might keep me busy until Oct-Nov, but then I’m out of ideas again. Thanks! Stargate Universe is prolly my favorite scifi show of all time. and do check out the Expanse, on amazon….they still have sounds in space(lol), but get a whole lot of the other stuff right(Flip and Burn, for one) and if you havent enjoyed frelling Farscape..get thee there!…and suspend all disbelief, because its worth it. and i recently enjoyed a big chunk of star wars…Andor to the end. andor and rogue one are pretty gritty by disney standards. ive read about a treatment of Asimov’s Foundation…with Lee Pace, but didnt want yet another subscription,lol. and the recent Dune movies…as well as the Sisterhood series on whichever network that was…were pretty good. lots better, save for fandom weirdos like me…than the David Lynch, etc versions of pretty much the same material(Herbert is hard to translate to film) and if you like procedural crime show that aint law and order svu…look to scandinavia, and daneland, and germania… from the latter, Dark was excellent. on netflix, last i looked. Expanse was great, last season weak sauce. Farscape best sci-fi I’ve seen. Your library could probably get you copies of the Inspector Morse, and later Inspector Lewis series. I sometimes find them up on Youtube. They are excellent watching and I have the full Inspector Morse series here at home. No big gun battles, no helicopter chases, no major explosions – just thoughtful character development and great stories based on the books set in an England that we do not see much. Same with Inspector Lewis too with the same values. Thank you, Lambert, for everything, and thanks to everyone who sent the many plantidotes over the years. We have enjoyed them every day and saved many to continue to enjoy in the future. It’s lovely to have Desert Dog’s tree as the final installment. Best wishes Lambert! And, a link for you to consider on your way out the door. This is the Breaking Points highlights of the absolutely wild press conference with Zelensky, Trump, and Vance. I think our boy Z may have killed any hope of future support from the US. But who knows? Trump does what Trump wants to do. However, I don’t think that there is any way Trump can support Ukraine after Zelensky’s outburst today. From the transcript 1) Nobody mentions Maidan, how odd. 2) No, Trump is not strong on detail but he has a firm grasp of the essentials. 3) The end, where Trump clearly visualizes Putin as, with him, a victim of Democrat calumnies — could Trump actually be showing empathy here???? — is awkward 4) Was Vance playing “Let’s you and him fight”? Obama was mentioned by Trump a few times at one point, but I couldn’t figure out the context. Was this a roundabout reference to Maiden? As for Vance, I bet he was hoping for an excuse to raise it to fisticuffs. There is nothing but upside to kicking VZ’s butt on tv. “As for Vance, I bet he was hoping for an excuse to raise it to fisticuffs. There is nothing but upside to kicking VZ’s butt on tv.” Fight, fight, fight!!!! (would have been so funny – and god, I’m disgusting) Z left without signing a critical minerals deal. So maybe it turns out to be a way to ease out of that after all the hoopla. > Z left without signing a critical minerals deal. That’s a damn shame. LOL How I will miss you, Lambert. All the best of luck to you, always! Is Z’s doctor a CIA “asset,” and running a similar game to what Dr. Theodor Morell was doing for the Brown Hair Satan of years gone bye? See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodor_Morell Z is just learning the lesson that all of America’s “Strategic Partners” learn eventually; with friends like the US, who needs enemies? This is also the perfect set up for a “Stabbed in the Back” myth for the Kiev regime. After the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia of the Nineteen Teens, Paris was flooded with “displaced” Russian ‘nobility’ and middle classes. Will Paris soon be seeing the birth of a vibrant Ukraine Exile culture and community? shit. i knew i should have jumped on that boat to Paris, mite near forty years ago,lol. would have still been Paris, back then…smoking assholes yammering philosophical gibberish on little streetside tables. Lol, that yammering a-hole could be me! Come on down to the Mermaid cafe And I will buy you a bottle of wine We will laugh and toast to nothing And smash our empty glasses down. Let’s have a round for these freaks and these soldiers A round for these friends of mine Let’s have another round for the bright red devil That keeps me in this tourist town…, Carey Joni Mitchell I’m sure it will hardly surprise you or anyone else here at NC to learn that the Daily Kos staff take is completely opposite: Zelenskyy shows true leadership as Trump implodes in Oval Office meltdown Talk about living in an alternate reality… P.S.: Once more, from me along with everyone else here, profound thanks for all you have done and best wishes for the future! https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/14/world/asia/14minerals.html US identifies vast riches of minerals in afghanistan June 14, 2010, Fifteen years ago. “The United States has discovered nearly $1 trillion in untapped mineral deposits in Afghanistan, far beyond any previously known reserves and enough to fundamentally alter the Afghan economy and perhaps the Afghan war itself, according to senior American government officials. (!!, OMG!) The previously unknown deposits — including huge veins of iron, copper, cobalt, gold and critical industrial metals like lithium — are so big and include so many minerals that are essential to modern industry that Afghanistan could eventually be transformed into one of the most important mining centers in the world, the United States officials believe. An internal Pentagon memo, for example, states that Afghanistan could become the “Saudi Arabia of lithium,” a key raw material in the manufacture of batteries for laptops and BlackBerrys.” Ukraine’s $500 billion rare earths scam: they don’t exist, and we should know better “Inside China Business” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tILXLxMTmgA&t=623s “Reports that Ukraine will pledge its vast reserves of rare earth metals and other strategic minerals in exchange for hundreds of billions of dollars worth of loan forgiveness and additional aid have supply chain managers perplexed. No honest assessment of Ukraine’s mineral assets comes anywhere close to the numbers that top government officials claim. The US Geological Survey, and even publications from Ukraine’s ministries report only trace amounts of rare earth metals anywhere in the country. Even were we only to consider non-rare earths, other problems become apparent. Many of those reserves are in Russian hands, and much of the rest can not be commercially mined at current market prices. The situation in Ukraine is alarmingly similar to Afghanistan, where Pentagon assessments of Afghan mineral reserves dramatically overstated their actual size and market value, while giving war planners additional time and resources to prosecute what was ultimately a losing war effort.” i watched the whole thing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_YtXWVfkJE remarkable is too soft a word. ive never seen anything like it. zelensky is under the bus and vance is next president Thanks for the link. At about 9 minutes into the video, Trump repeatedly refers to what sounds like “raw” earth instead of rare earths. Is that what you heard? Wow, reading that transcript seems almost surreal. I wonder if Vance’s presence was to position him in the thick of things now, for a presidential run in ’28. Regardless of what people think of the theater of it all (and those opinions will fall along all the predictable lines) — I suspect the substance of the position Trump and Vance have staked out will prove quite popular with the public. Swiss Vance now? Vraiment? Je ne le pense pas. Non, je ne le pense pas du tout. I think both Trump and Vance appropriated finger wagging from the Dems. Also, this was hysterically funny to watch! Reminded me of Trump’s having an on-camera meeting with Schumer and Pelosi during his first term. They were terrified and it was my pleasure to watch. My question is if it was intended to go this way. From Vance and Trump that is. Typically these world leader press conferences are scripted. Here instead you have Vance right of the bat pushing Zelensky’s buttons. Zelensky hits back, Vance accuses him of being disrespectful to Trump. “You come here, on the day of my daugther’s wedding…” Sorry, wrong script. Anyway it goes on until Trump gets out the steel chair and tells Zelensky not to tell him what he will feel. Zelensky starts to backtrack and Trump goes in for the kill “We are trying to save you, come with me if you want to live…” Sorry, wrong script again. I just don’t see why they would have set this up like this otherwise. You don’t have a frank discussion in front of the media, you just don’t. Wonder what the Ukrainians were told would be going down. I’m sure this was intended, and I’d bet the real audience was not Z, but American voters and the agencies. Just watched the video. How richly enjoyable. I took in about the first 10 minutes and then skipped ahead. I wanted to see the blowup but I also wanted to see it in context so I scrolled to about 35 minutes. And then sat through a seemingly interminable and ignorant harangue by Zelensky, who came across as thoroughly detestable. By the time Vance interjects, it comes as a relief. https://www.france24.com/fr/info-en-continu/20250228-le-verbatim-de-la-passe-d-armes-entre-zelensky-trump-et-vance/ The verbatim exchange of arms between Zelensky, Trump and Vance Verbatim except they made sure to leave out this line, which appeared to be the line that set Trump off: Z: “Everybody has problems even you. You have a nice ocean and don’t feel. But you will feel it in the future“. Now that is interesting that. Trump seems to think that the two oceans on either side of America will always protect them. And as part of this, he wants both Canada and Greenland to make this geographical block secure. Same with his idea of an Iron Dome for America. Call it Fortress America. So for Zelensky to say that this will not always be true must have really struck a raw nerve with Trump. I don’t think that’s what struck the nerve, Rev. Trump did, after all, warn of the risk of world war, several times during the event. I think it’s a more basic response. Zelensky’s statement “you will feel it in the future” can be interpreted one of two ways: as a threat, or as a prediction. Neither is very gracious. I myself was appalled by it, not so much by what Zelensky said, but just the fact that he said it. Just not a very “politic” thing to say, especially when you’re a begging dependent. Having see the Breaking Points Video I thought the the highlight was the UK Ambassador to the US @6:48 in the background with head in hand. It was 40 minutes into the media PR $unt when it all came undone. Few other notes. “For his part, Trump made clear that the US would continue delivering military aid. All Zelensky had to do was remain calm for a few more minutes and they would’ve signed a deal. The argument started when Trump pointed out that it would be hard to make a deal if you talk about Putin the way Zelensky does. Vance interjects to make the reasonable point that Biden called Putin names and that didn’t get us anywhere. The Zelensky/Trump dynamic was calm and stable. It was when Vance spoke that Zelensky started to interrogate him.” Lmmao … from experience it was like watching a white collar Coke deal go bad, no guns allowed affairs, so it all comes down to attitude and the knowledge of it being backed up. Zelensky just got put in the – Gimp Box – on international media for everyone else to see. On that note I wonder what the EU posse is musing right now, come to Oval office and get a public spanking for all to see, go back home and plead for ice – ???? The only other thing is the juxtaposition of Trump/Vance/Musk vs say Putin/Xi on global media. How is that dynamic going to play out in the near and long term. Thank you Lambert. Vaya con dios. Lambert, Fare thee well wherever you may fare. May your chisels remain sharp and saw lines true. Ave atque vale. Retired Carpenter In grief, I often resort to poetry: spoken by Prospero. Now my charms are all o’erthrown, And what strength I have ’s mine own, Which is most faint. Now ’tis true I must be here confined by you, Or sent to Naples. Let me not, Since I have my dukedom got And pardoned the deceiver, dwell In this bare island by your spell, But release me from my bands With the help of your good hands. Gentle breath of yours my sails Must fill, or else my project fails, Which was to please. Now I want Spirits to enforce, art to enchant, And my ending is despair, Unless I be relieved by prayer, Which pierces so that it assaults Mercy itself, and frees all faults. As you from crimes would pardoned be, Let your indulgence set me free. MAY YOU WEATHER ANY UPCOMING STORMS WITH GRACE AND INSIGHT. You leave a big hole hehind Lambert ! Lambert, goodbye. I’ll especially miss your DOGEbag commentary. Enjoy your retirement or whatever comes next for you. Lambert, there’s nothing I can add to the very eloquent encomia expressed by my fellow commentators other than I share their feelings and well wishes for you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. I will miss you. I have added orts and scraps (for the final time; thanks for all the kind words). It’s fitting that “the goddamed Democrat Party” is the topic. That, and an amazing session at the White House with Big Z, Vance, and Trump. I have a couple of weekend posts to go, and then… I’ll see you on the other side. Z: Everybody has problems even you. You have a nice ocean and don’t feel. But you will feel it in the future. Whooboy…that made Trump pipe up,didn’t it? Code for blowback is a bitch? You take care, Lambert. Wow, just watched the melee or was it a poker game, with the many mentions of not having the cards? I’d imagine the big Z wishes he’d worn his lucky green shirt~ Maybe it was the lighting, but i’ve never seen the President looking oh so very Oompa-Loompa as today, wow. Oompa, Loompa, doom-pa-dee-da If you’re not greedy, you will go far You will live in happiness too Like the Oompa, Loompa, doompa-dee-do Doompa-dee-do I see the Democrats have not changed. They are going with Democrat Elissa Slotkin who is Republican Lite but people will more likely just go with an actual Republican. When you don’t offer a truly different choice you shouldn’t be surprised if there is no rush to follow you. But the Democrats will be. I was just watching a silly but comforting movie. The big theme, so big it is repeated multiple times, is when what you are doing is not working you need to step back and go in another direction. The problem that elected Democrats and their consultants have is that they are having a hard time understanding that because they are comfortable and have been somewhat protected and don’t realize that is not the case for more and more Americans. They really do not understand how this happened. They will not change until they truly hit bottom. It is too uncomfortable for them as their livelihoods, where the real money is, will not survive real change. So posturing and pretending and putting the spooks on the air to reassure the owners that none of it means anything will continue. Sad to see you go and thanks for all you have done here. You’ve done a good stint. I am educated and better from what you have shared here. Particularly the covid coverage. and you are going out at a quiet news time. nope nothing going on of note at all right now…. :D The other side? Is the grass greener? Flowers smell better? What about bees, butterflies? See you there, I guess? Lambert – thank you for your insights and your wit – I will miss reading your column – good luck – happy trails. Brian Appreciate the promotion of bassists. I saw Jaco Pastorius with Joni Mitchel in 1979 and the solo he did was a highlight of the concert. It was the first time I’d experienced looping in a live performance, mind expanding. Great that you saw it. This video should have been titled Joni with a very good band. As Wayne Shorter said of her (roughly), she didn’t copy any one else’s style but held with her own. I’m a musician, I understand something of how these things work. These major cats backing her up were all off book. That was a major economic effort. And an artistic success. Pat Metheny, Joni Mitchell, Jaco Pastorius, Michael Brecker – “Shadows And Light”. I’m watching it again after some years. There is solid musicianship throughout. It was Joni’s show and she had the musical foundation to propel it. Done watching — She was better than good. And she was a universalist human being. Thank you Lambert for all the insight, and (“dry, very dry” :D ) wit over the years, you will be missed! I wish you only the best. This felt like a fitting Irish well-wish for the occasion: “May misfortune follow you the rest of your life, and never catch up.” Thank you, Lambert! Thank you, Lambert, for all of your wonderful Water Coolers, articles, and analyses. Every one of them was a masterpiece. I am especially grateful for your unrivaled Covid coverage and for honoring the avian world with the beautiful Bird Song of the Day. Much happiness and success with all of your future endeavors! “Andrew Cuomo to receive labor endorsement in mayor’s race he’s yet to enter”, because government is organized crime, lol, it’s like putting it on a billboard. The good news is that no mayor of NYC has ever gone on to higher office. Of course that’s only good for those of us who don’t live there. At least NYS prison guards know how to organize a wildcat strike and get concessions. Hochul had 6500 National Guard acting as prison guards. National coverage is crickets. Deal reached to end strike by NY prison workers, Hochul says syracuse.com We’ll see if they go back work tomorrow. The strike worked. State caved. Why are other public or private workers so timid? I saw that. Kudos to the prison guards I hope, but not knowing the lay of the land, and having a deep suspicion of the prison industry, I’ll refrain from being too enthusiastic. Thinking about the question you finished with, prison guards holding an almost unique position of power as to who can and will fill in, combined with society’s urgent need for uninterrupted service. Air traffic control professionals might fit here as well. Baristas, well, I already make my own coffee. Thank you, Lambert, for all the years of Water Cooler posts, as well as the countless yellow wader sessions! An amazing body of work. Gonna miss your intelligent insight badly, Lambert. Gonna miss that dry wit the most! Thank you, Lambert. The Covid coverage has been vital, and the general insight and snark have been greatly appreciated. Wishing you the best for the future. Stay safe, wherever you are, whatever you do. Thank you for all the hard work. Take a well deserved rest. You have more friends and colleagues than you will ever know. Lambert – a suggestion? I think you mentioned one of your next projects is writing a book? If so please let us know when and where it is – cuz nothing helps a book get traction like the 500 glowing reviews that I’m sure everyone here would participate in providing. :) Thank you LS. I wish I was not so skint. Hat’s off. Lambert….will send a check……I cannot BELIEVE you are leaving. NC is an absolute fave and your “dry” wit has grown on me as the years pass. BEST……..and take care. What a last Water Cooler! It’s like the Hollywood exit where the explosion is right behind you as you walk off the stage. Lol enjoy your cool new world my guy. Lambert 4 evah! Lambert, you’ll be missed. I hope retirement suits you. So long, Lambert. And thanks for all the wit and wisdom. For man who rarely laughs out loud, you certainly inspired a number of guffaws for me over the years. Best wishes! Some of the conservatives I know seem generally happy – although they are all convinced that many woke forces are out to get them, personally and specifically. That doesn’t sound pleasant, no matter how they describe themselves. The MAGA heads I know for other reasons would, I believe, tell you they are happy. And they probably are because they love drama and being angry all the time. Imagined slights – they know I don’t like this many pickles! – crazy paranoia about the knock-out game and seed oils and not going to parts of town where they would be sex trafficked (even thought they have guns in their purses.) It’s like their social skills were learned from bots. Thanks for the time together we all shared with you, Lambert. Water Cooler was my most eagerly anticipated read of the day. So sorry it’s going away. All the best to Lambert! “Fare thee well now Let your life proceed by its own designs Nothing to tell now…” Yours words have been a treasure. Thank you for everything, Lambert! In case you haven’t already seen this and if you don’t plan to get away from the internet completely after your retirement, it may be of interest to you for future web searches: Bruce Sterling (the sci-fi author) posted on his Mastodon today about an open-source search engine that prioritizes non-commercial content, which sounds like something that a lot of us have been wishing for. For some quick examples that I tested with, a simple search for “Ukraine” returned several of NC’s favorite/friend blogs in the first page of results. A search for “calpers” returned Naked Capitalism on the second page of results. Compare that to Google’s results. Their tagline on their github calls it an “Internet search engine for text-oriented websites. Indexing the small, old and weird web.” https://marginalia-search.com/ I hope you enjoy this and that you also enjoy your retirement! Best regards. Thank you, Turtle! “Internet search engine for text-oriented websites. Indexing the small, old and weird web.” https://marginalia-search.com/ Marginalia Search – what a find! Former librarian here, frothing at the mouth. This is fantastic! You’re welcome, Jenny! I hope you enjoy it and find it useful! We have much more to thank you for than can be said. I will miss your insights and wish you all good things to come. Thank you, Lambert! Wishing you well on the new stage of your life as you will have more time to go after those pursuits that you have left aside. Lots of changes ahead for you but I hope that you check in on comments every now and then to add your own insights. Happy trails. I agree. Now that you have more time you will accomplish much. We will all be saying “I knew him when . . . ” Have fun, but don’t have too much fun. And as that old Irish saying goes ‘May you be in Heaven thirty minutes before the devil knows that you are dead.’ I’ve a hole in my heart, now that it comes down to it. Lambert, please drop us all a line from time to time and let us know how you’re doing. Only the best wishes for you and yours in your next phase in life. I have gained so much from my daily visits to the Water Cooler that I can’t even express. Working in BigTech I am surrounded by kool-aid drinking PMC neoliberals all day every day, and Water Cooler has been a welcome respite from all that. Because of Water Cooler I joined Twitter (now X) to follow Matt Stoller, and from there have ended up following 75-odd people and counting, many of whom I was introduced to through these very pages. This eclectic collection of X’ers has led me down paths that have contributed my having a more open mind and open heart. The commentariat does the same every day. I so appreciate what you have done for all of us, Lambert. I hope your retirement includes writing projects we can enjoy in the future . . . but more than that I hope you know you’ve already done more good than most writers could ever hope to achieve. Lambert, you went deep–deep into places, issues, causes, committees, bird calls, tree barks, mindsets, air flows, transcripts, computer coding, keyboards, overlooked photographers, Twitters, gardens, and so much more. I don’t go that deep–probably don’t have the patience, but thank you for taking us on the ride. Have a merry and satisfying post-NC journey. Lambert, thank you for everything. I’ve marked so many days by the water cooler that I can’t even attempt to count. How will I even know it’s 2pm without the water cooler? Wishing you all the best and echo Petal’s comment that if you are ever in the Hanover NH area, the first, second and third round are on me. And dinner will be on me. Thank you Lambert for your dedication and good will! My best wishes to you always. Thank you Lambert: You, along with helpful commentarians, were, from the beginning (Mar 2020, if memory serves) the only believable source for COVID information. Of which I fear there will be very little from now on, things being how they are. Best of luck Lambert. You will be missed. Wayfarer, go with God, and reason, within reason. Thank you, thank you, thank you for you work in NC. You will be missed, but I think NC will just be a little different. Your Covid coverage and political coverage has been very helpful. Highlighting different websites (Black Agenda Report to the Daily Yonder) (and Yves does similarly) shows how despite differences (some significant, others not so much) the working class has a common interest and a common enemy. I will look forward to your future contributions (and book?). Inspired by Angie Neer’s b/w photo, I had hoped to send a couple before now, maybe an occasional plantidote will be in the works. Donated last night. Re today’s WC: It’s a wonder Bernie and the Kamala cover didn’t poke holes in your yellow waders. I had finally put my toe in Facebook, but I recently tried Mastodon, which is more to my liking. A Covid post pointed to this concerning future vaccine possibilities. https://absolutelymaybe.plos.org/2025/02/28/exciting-news-from-europe-and-roadblocks-in-the-us-nextgen-covid-vax-update-26/ Enjoy your retirement. Thank you for all the amazing work you’ve done, Lambert. Don’t be a stranger. May the Long Time Sun guide you on your journey. Darn, howl…see you on the sunny side. Darn, with-drawl count starts…Thank you so much for your numerous gifts! Be well.🌅 One last heartfelt thanks and fond farewell Lambert. Sure will miss you and Watercooler lots. Wishing you much awsome reading and fresh new discoveries, insights and experiences. Keep in touch! Lambert, thank you for the years of education and entertainment. There was a hole in my life on weekends, now it will be permanent. Wipes tear from eye … as you partake of a bit of Clarke&Dawe … Lambert. John Clarke: Thanks for your time. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=539bkrv7g2k Lambert, thank you so much! “Violence alters human genes for generations, researchers discover” A version of that was one of the premises of Freud’s book Moses and Monotheism among other things. The old is new again. Till now I’ve avoided stopping here today: I don’t want to see you leave. As much as I’ve enjoyed the insight and humor you’ve brought here, work-ethic and more, I appreciate the sense of plain old common decency that comes across in your writings. You’ve set an example that I and many others will try to follow, hopefully meeting with at least some success. Truely. Thank you, Lambert!!! Wish you the best on future endeavours. Thank you 1000x for daily nudging my personal dial back toward ‘there is maybe some hope for humanity’; for building and maintaining a network and hub of covid info; and for many a well researched and thought out take that I have learned from and passed on (w attribution!). Long live the old school blogosphere! Thank you, Lambert, for all the gifts you’ve given, which other commenters have documented so well, and best wishes to you as you take this next turn in the road. A final thank you to Lambert for everything. Truly a blessing for all the readers. Wish you well for the next part of your journey. Lambert, Thanks for the phrase “birds like messy”. I think of it often as I wander around my messy garden in a neighborhood of sterile manicured yards. Seems like the messy place is the only one full of life, especially birds and bugs. Also, have appreciated your insights and jokes. A short cynical take on the rally to protect the special health programs, you have to understand that for many NY elected Congressional members it is the biggest and most important piece of the numerous ways that money was funneled to various power groups as a result of 9/11 that of the biggest thing they ever accomplished. It was, quite honestly, the only real accomplishment of Hillary Clinton’s senate terms, the rest was renaming post offices. It is not just that there is a psychic wound about the events of that day that in NY is inescapable. They literally have benefitted for years because of the largesse that has been spent over the years. They cannot lose it or its legacy of success. And you are right that it is just wrong that this is the wrong focus or approach, they all should have gotten single payer universal health care long ago. In the meanwhile as a fitting irony in the same week that was going on, Mount Sinai won their court battle to close Mount Sinai Beth Israel Hospital on First Avenue and 16th Street. This was the hospital farthest downtown since Saint Vincent’s was closed. If they had their way there would be nothing below 23rd but urgent care and enhanced urgent care centers. (I have it on good authority that the extensive one across from where St Vincent’s once stood has to send anything truly serious to real hospitals, one of their doctors told me.It has beds but they are for observable situations.) Now it is true that a new temporary court stay was put in place Friday, with the hopes that the full court will hear the case, but they are determined to shut the hospital. Take care Lambert, thank you. Thank you so much, Lambert, and good luck for the future! Thank you for all the hard work, Lambert! Especially the covid coverage these last (checks watch) five years! The proposed New Yorker cover of Kamala is really a remarkable thing. While initially distracted by the hallowed visages that are somehow printed onto her suit, it was the raised index finger that surprised me. That’s a gesture that readers will remember I am sure, popularised by our friends ISIS: the tawhid, “the belief in the oneness of God and a key component of the Muslim religion.” As I understand it, this is the type of fundamentalism that rejects any other religious outlooks, including Shia etc, as idolatry, and worthy of death. It’s a very odd gesture for Kamala Harris to make. https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2014-09-03/isis-sends-message Thank you Lambert, an era is passing, all is sackcloth and ashes. Farewell and god speed. It’s also a very popular gesture amongst cricket umpires. Doesn’t she have connections to India? She does indeed, but apparently the umpiring thing is to raise your index finger above your head. And if Kamala had her finger over her had it would suggest that, um, she was the umpire when she was actually a competitor in the election. So if even the image had her signaling Trump as out with a finger over her head, it would be wrong because if she beat Trump she’s a bowler, or fielder, not an umpire. And her finger is most definitely not over her head. I prefer a theory of rank stupidity. Goodbye and thanks for all the thoughts! Thank you for the years of work Lambert. I was working yesterday and thought more than once,this is the last water cooler. I hope your next adventure is satisfying and you continue to share your insights with the many who appreciate them. Cheers Many thanks!!! Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Comment * Name * Email *

Share this article BlackRock has incorporated the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) into its model portfolios, allocating between 1% and 2%, as Bloomberg reported today. This move comes as the world’s largest asset manager adjusts its investment strategy, which includes reducing equity overweight positions and exposure to long-duration bonds. Michael Gates, lead portfolio manager for BlackRock’s Target Allocation ETF model portfolio suite, highlighted Bitcoin’s role as a diversification tool. Despite recent market fluctuations, BlackRock maintains its strategic view on Bitcoin, with the firm overseeing more than $11 trillion in assets. IBIT, launched in January 2024, has attracted over $37 billion in inflows, although it saw $900 million in outflows last week. By November 2024, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust reached a significant milestone by amassing $40 billion in assets in just 211 days, becoming one of the largest ETFs. The crypto market has been pressured by economic concerns and trade tensions, dampening risk appetite. Bitcoin is currently trading at $84,500, following a 7% dip to $78,200 overnight. The largest cap crypto had previously reached nearly $110,000 last month before pulling back. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Title: Airlines Scrub DEI From Latest Annual Reports

Subscribe today to keep up with the latest travel industry news. Select a question above or ask something else U.S. airlines have begun to minimize mentions of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in their annual reports following political pressure from the Trump administration. Notably, American and United Airlines removed DEI sections from their latest reports, while only Delta and Southwest Airlines maintained such statements, focusing on merit-based hiring. This trend is part of a larger shift in corporate America, which has seen companies like Walmart and McDonald's also scale back DEI initiatives, influenced by recent political and legal changes, including the Supreme Court's ruling on affirmative action. Read the Stories Major U.S. airlines are starting to dial down statements on diversity, equity and inclusion hiring policies after wide-ranging pushback from the Trump administration. In American Airlines’ 2024 10-K, the company didn’t include a section on DEI – it had DEI sections in each of the four prior years. In its 2023 annual report, American said, “Cultivating an environment that celebrates diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) is a priority for us,” and listed out a range of initiatives the company had done to increase its diversity. This year, American said, “We seek to hire the best and brightest,” and made no mention of diversity. United Airlines had a similar shift. In its most recent annual report, there are no mentions of “diversity, equity and inclusion.” Last year, in the same report, United provided statistics on the percentage of women and underrepresented minorities in its workforce. The company provided similar statistics in 2022, 2021, and 2020. JetBlue also did not have any statements on DEI hiring policies in their most recent annual reports, but did include such statements in its 2023 10-Ks. “The report reflects that we have always hired based on merit and qualifications, especially as safety is critical to our airline,” JetBlue said in a statement to Skift. “We believe in the programs, practices, and policies that we’ve put in place to create a workplace where people feel valued, respected, and able to do their best work.” While Alaska Airlines did not mention DEI by name, it did say, "We believe that all who depend on Alaska Air Group deserve respect regardless of race, ethnicity, ability, age, gender, sexual orientation, or gender identity. We are committed to treating every person equally – on and off our aircraft. " Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines are the only two major U.S. carriers that included a statement on DEI in their 2024 annual reports. “Our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion is critical to effective human capital management at Delta,” Delta said in its 2024 10-K. The carrier also emphasized in the same report that its hiring practices were “merit-based.” Last year, the Atlanta-based carrier said one of its DEI initiatives included: “Closing diversity gaps in senior leadership positions by increasing the representation of women, Black and Latin/Hispanic groups in those roles.” This year, Delta didn’t mention closing any diversity gap in senior leadership, but instead it was “ adopting recruitment strategies that seek qualified leadership candidates with diverse experiences, skills and perspectives and expanding leadership development programs to continue promoting from within.” Southwest said in its 2024 annual report that “DEIB [diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging] is a part of the Company’s culture.” Southwest didn’t mention initiatives related to hiring more women and underrepresented minorities in the report, but had such mentions in its 2023 report. The industry has been slow to close its gender and racial gaps. For example, around 80% of flight attendants are women. But only 8% are pilots, even with a significant increase in pushes to recruit more female pilots. Delta’s and United’s most recent ESG reports from 2023 say that women make up around 34% and 33% of senior roles, respectively. American, Delta, United and JetBlue also signed onto the International Air Transport Association’s “25 by 2025,” a pledge to increase female representation among corporate and frontline roles. DEI policies in corporate America took off in 2020 following the George Floyd protests. Many industries, including airlines, started publicly embracing diversity hiring policies. And as the industry faced an acute pilot shortage following the pandemic, airlines made major strides to recruit more women and people of color into those roles. United opened a flight school called the United Aviate Academy and covered much of the hefty costs associated with becoming a pilot. The carrier touted that 80% of its first Aviate class were either women or people of color. United also has business resource groups for its employees. Delta partnered with historically Black Hampton University as part of its collegiate pilot career path pipeline. And Alaska launched a partnership with Sisters in the Sky in 2019 to increase its representation of Black female pilots by 2025. President Trump and allies like Elon Musk have blamed DEI hiring policies for compromising safety in the airline industry. In a post on X, Musk claimed DEI was a reason for the Alaska Airlines blowout last year. “Do you want to fly in an airplane where they prioritized DEI hiring over your safety?” Musk wrote on X. “That is actually happening.” Trump blamed DEI for a fatal collision near Reagan National Airport, without citing any evidence. The National Transportation Safety Board is still investigating the incident. Some airline executives have also changed the way they talk about DEI, instead emphasizing that their companies hire on merit. “Well, we do hire on merit,” United CEO Scott Kirby said during a January 22 call with analysts. “We can hire the absolute best of the best and have a naturally diverse workforce.” Delta CEO Ed Bastian told the Atlanta Journal Constitution last month that DEI hiring is merit-based. “We don’t have DEI initiatives. We have people initiatives. … That’s the way it’s always been. It’s core to who we are,” Bastian said. U.S. airlines toning down their language on DEI reflects a broader trend in corporate America. Walmart, Ford, Meta, and McDonald’s have walked back their DEI programs. BlackRock also removed references to DEI in its annual report. The pullback started last year after the Supreme Court struck down affirmative action in college admissions. Trump has issued multiple executive orders to end federal DEI programs and to bar the practice by federal contractors. A federal judge in Maryland blocked these bans on February 21. Another executive order asked federal agencies to flag corporate diversity hiring programs for potential investigation. A report from law firm White & Case advised companies filing 10-Ks to “carefully consider their diversity disclosure and ensure it is updated and aligns with a company's current priorities and policies.” U.S. agencies, including the Department of Transportation and the Federal Aviation Administration, have deleted webpages related to DEI hiring policies. What am I looking at? The performance of airline sector stocks within the ST200. The index includes companies publicly traded across global markets including network carriers, low-cost carriers, and other related companies.

Title: BlackRock Adds Its IBIT Bitcoin ETF To Alternative Asset Model Portfolio
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/02/28/blackrock-adds-bitcoin-etf-to-alternative-asset-model-portfolio
Time Published: 2025-02-28T17:13:39Z

BlackRock has added the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), the fund issued by the asset manager that holds bitcoin (BTC), to one of its model portfolios. These models suggest portfolios and rebalances which are then followed by advisors and platforms who can also request adjustments to the models based on their investment needs. BlackRock added a 1% to 2% allocation to IBIT in its target allocation portfolio that allows for alternative assets, according to James Seyffart, ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. In a report from Thursday, Michael Gates, lead portfolio manager for BlackRock’s Target Allocation ETF models, wrote that there are “several substantive arguments that support bitcoin’s long-term investment merit.” According to Gates, this includes the crypto asset’s novel store of value and global monetary alternative, as well as hedge to the U.S. dollar hegemony and political instability, and proxy play on the “offline” to “online” digital transition of goods and services. “Collectively, these features may help provide unique and additive sources of risk premia and diversification to traditional multi-asset portfolios,” Gates wrote. The model represents one of IBIT’s smaller portfolios, however, the step is significant given that it is the first time BlackRock had made the decision to add IBIT to any of their models. “This is a big deal because this is the first of those models to add bitcoin,” said Seyffart. “It probably won’t be the last but bitcoin is also a lightning rod for many — some will hate this while others will love it — so I don’t know if or when they would add IBIT to their primary models that have a lot more money tracking them.” BlackRock’s model portfolios manage around $150 billion in assets as of December 31, 2024. CORRECTION (February 28, 2025, 14:56 UTC): Adds that BlackRock's model portfolios manage $150 billion in assets as opposed to $130 billion which the article incorrectly stated previously.

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. United States President Donald Trump's views have changed corporate America's approach. Photo / Getty Images THREE KEY FACTS It’s been extraordinary how quickly corporate America has jumped - if not to Donald Trump’s will – at least fast enough to be seen on the same side. The five big shifts outlined in this column will inevitably invite policy responses around the world – including in New Zealand. “BP rolls back on Net Zero Goals – bets $US10 billion on fossil fuels". The headline was qualified - “A smart move or a climate setback?” BP chief executive Murray Auchincloss has claimed the Ukraine war, the pandemic and unstable energy markets have slowed the shift to renewables. But in truth, BP’s strategic shift is as much about boosting profits and shareholder returns as the slowdown in the shift to renewables. Call it a fortuitous alignment for the oil major as it falls into line with the fossil fuel peddling from The White House. I got a sniff of this changing mindset at the 2023 Apec CEO Summit in San Francisco. Exxon chairman and CEO Darren Woods’ address was pure anodyne: climate change is real; human activity plays a role; it is one of the major problems facing the world today – but it’s not the only one. Woods segued. Many ideas to accelerate the energy transition were not based in economic, technological, or political reality. “We cannot replace overnight an energy system that took 150 years to build. The size and complexity are simply too vast … No country has ever joined the developed world without access to oil and gas. The countries of the global south have every right to lift their people out of energy poverty and into the global middle class.” There is some truth to this. But coming from New Zealand where our political leaders had revelled in imposing a ban on oil and gas exploration, the contrast was stark. This strategic shift simply underlines Shane Jones’ moves to leverage New Zealand’s resource base are not based on an alternate reality. The shift is real. BlackRock boss Larry Fink has made a commercial fetish of positioning his company at the forefront of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). But when the world’s largest asset manager released its annual report this week, all the usual virtuous references to DEI policies were gone. In 2023, BlackRock said a diverse workforce with an inclusive and connected culture was “a commercial imperative and indispensable to its success”. The latest report simply says “delivering for the firm’s clients requires attracting the best people from across the world. BlackRock is committed to creating an environment that supports top talent and fosters diverse perspectives to avoid group think”. It looks very much like the powerful Fink has simply fallen into line with the sentiments in Trump’s executive order that instructed federal agencies to investigate corporate DEI programmes on the grounds of potential civil rights violations. It’s too early to say what the implications will be for sustainable finance deals but when BlackRock pulls away from DEI and the oil majors step up fossil fuel production, there is a significant shift under way that will have implications here. The United States military has begun firing transgender members, who will be separated from service unless they receive exemptions. “Military service by service members and applicants for military service who have a current diagnosis or history of, or exhibit symptoms consistent with, gender dysphoria is incompatible with military service,” a Defence Department memo says. “Service by these individuals is not in the best interests of the military services and is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security.” The memo follows Trump’s signing of an executive order that took aim at transgender troops in a personal way, describing them as “not consistent with the humility and selflessness required of a service member”. Waivers would be granted only “provided there is a compelling government interest in retaining the service member that directly supports warfighting capabilities”. NZ’s defence chiefs will have to watch out that the US does not seek to impose restrictions on those serving within the forces with which it operates. Washington Post owner and tech baron Jeff Bezos has issued an edict to his newspaper ruling that the opinions section would now be focused on “personal liberties and free markets” and won’t publish anything that opposes those ideas. “We are going to be writing every day in support and defence of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets,” the billionaire Amazon founder wrote in an email to Post staffers he published on X. “We’ll cover other topics too of course, but viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others.” Bezos’ stance is not too far distant from that imposed (through osmosis) by Rupert Murdoch in his flagship mastheads the Wall St Journal and The Australian. But it is a shock to the sensibilities of staffers and readers of the liberal leaning Post. Post publisher and chief executive William Lewis said that change was not about “siding with any political party”. “This is about being crystal clear about what we stand for.” It’s also crystal clear that personal liberties and free markets is what the Trump administration stands for. The US Vice-President stunned the recent Munich Security Conference when he said the threat he worries most about is not Russia, nor China – but the threat from within. He exploded the consensus between Europe and the US by arguing Europe has retreated from its most fundamental values by repressing conservative speech and political actors and was reaping the fruits of uncontrolled immigration. It was the equivalent of farting in church. What it does signal is the US leadership will respect no boundaries when it comes to selling its worldview. Will New Zealand subvert its own values to fall into line – or is it time to craft a new story we can all be proud of? Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read.

Title: Ethereum – Institutional sell-offs hit ETH hard, but why are spot traders still buying?

Time Published: 2025-02-28T15:30:28Z

Institutional and spot investors are clashing over ETH lately. Ethereum [ETH] has seen a major price drop lately amid a broader market downturn. In fact, over the last 24 hours, the altcoin declined by 10.41% on the charts, bringing its one-month loss to 33.10%. Institutional investors, including BlackRock and Fidelity, have contributed to this trend by continuing to sell ETH spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). However, according to AMBCrypto’s analysis, spot traders have helped prevent an even steeper decline. This week has seen significant ETH sell-offs by institutional investors through exchange-traded funds (ETFs). At the time of analysis, these investors seemed to have offloaded approximately $293 million worth of ETFs since the market opened on Monday, 24 February. A week-long sell-off like this usually alludes to skepticism among institutional investors about ETH’s price outlook. In fact, according to Coinbase’s ETH/USD daily chart, this sell-off caused the asset to drop from an opening price of $2,821.64 to a press-time value of $2,103.84. Source: Coinglass Among institutional sellers, BlackRock and Fidelity have contributed the most, offloading $144 million and $65.4 million worth of ETH, respectively, this week. While institutional investors have been selling, spot traders have been actively buying ETH over the same period. Between 24-28 February, approximately $864 million worth of ETH was purchased across cryptocurrency exchanges, according to Coinglass’ exchange netflow data. Notably, even as ETH recorded a 10% drop in the last 24 hours, spot traders made their second-largest purchase of the week, acquiring $241 million worth of ETH. Source: Coinglass When significant institutional selling is met with strong spot buying, it points to underlying bullish sentiment in the market. AMBCrypto found that this week’s buying pressure has been primarily driven by retail investors, as large investors—who typically control a substantial portion of supply—have continued selling. According to IntoTheBlock, from a low of 36,430 ETH sold on 25 February, large investors have since offloaded an additional 114,850 ETH. If retail traders sustain their buying activity, ETH could maintain its bullish momentum and avoid dropping below the $2,000-threshold. The ETH exchange reserve, which tracks the amount of ETH held across different cryptocurrency exchanges, could serve as a confirmation of a price reversal.

If the press time reading of 18.9 million ETH declines further, it would indicate strengthening bullish momentum and a potential rally for ETH. This would mean that institutional sell pressure won’t potentially weigh on ETH as much.

A HUSBAND AND wife cryptocurrency trading team arrested in Dublin over an alleged €21m international money laundering operation have been accused of facilitating organised crime. Jixu Wang, 35, and his 34-year-old wife, Ye Wang, who are originally from China but living on Avoca Road, were initially charged with possessing crime proceeds in a digital bank account between September 2023 and February 2024. They had been denied bail and have been in custody since 16 November last year. The couple appeared again at Dublin District Court where Detective Garda Barry Cusack informed Judge Deirdre Gearty that the Director of Public Prosecutions directed trial on indictment in the Circuit Court. They were also further charged with facilitating organised crime. Judge Gearty noted they made no reply when the detective put the new charges to them. She remanded them in continuing custody pending the preparation of a book of evidence, and they will appear again next week. Following a “complex” investigation by the Dublin East Garda economic crime unit, with cooperation from Europol and police forces in Germany, Spain, Switzerland and the UK, officers arrested the unemployed couple on 12 November. They searched their rented apartment on Avoca Road, Blackrock. An earlier bail hearing was told the pair previously ran a cryptocurrency trading business. They moved from the Philippines to Ireland in 2023 as part of an “immigration investment programme” after donating €400,000 to a charity, ICARE Housing CLG. Advertisement Detective Garda Steven Dunican and Barry Cusack raised concerns about flight risk or that they could dispose of evidence. They had said officers from a Garda economic crime unit received information from German police about a suspected investment fraud.A German citizen had €10,000 transferred from his bank to a Paytend digital bank account of Wang. Detective Garda Cusack conducted inquiries with Paytend regarding Jixu Wang, and it was alleged the accused used his Chinese passport number on the account. Garda Cusack identified 1,894 unusual transactions transferred into the account, valued at €5,043,705, from 622 different IBANs over five months between 2 July and 9 November 2023. It was claimed that there were other unusual transactions between another Paytend account held by his wife, Ye Wang, who is a qualified accountant. Her Paytend account allegedly received 733 transactions valued at just over €2.1m from 321 different bank accounts from 11 September 2023, and 12 January last year. The court heard claims GPS location has been obtained for login dates for both Paytend accounts, matching their address. The detectives claimed the couple were both unemployed but had just over €7 million in their accounts. Gardai, including the Criminal Assets Bureau, allegedly identified €14.7m in cryptocurrency wallets, of which €4.4m has been seized or frozen by the investigation team, the bail hearing was told. Their apartment was searched, resulting in an alleged seizure of €20,000, gold coins and five envelopes with “seed words” to access a cryptocurrency wallet. Documents, phones and laptops have also been recovered. It was alleged Mrs Wang helped create fake documents to set up “money ” accounts, but she denied knowing it was part of a crime. The detectives feared the couple, who have a young child, would leave the country if released on bail, as they had no family in Ireland or links to this jurisdiction.

Title: Bitcoin Boom’s Expiry Date? CryptoQuant CEO Reveals Timeline

Many people wonder about the length of Bitcoin’s rollercoaster journey that its price increase has been on. The bull run may persist until at least April 2025, argues CryptoQuant CEO, Ki Young Ju. Should this be the case, it could signal the longest ever Bitcoin bull cycle. Ju created a Bitcoin growth rate difference statistic for May 2024 that formed the foundation for his projection. Monitoring the long-term market movements of the crypto helps one to ascertain whether the asset is still in a growth phase or overheated. Right now, Bitcoin is in what he refers to as a “critical zone,” in which market signals combine bullish and bearish patterns. Whether Bitcoin keeps on its ascent or begins to lose vigor will depend mostly on the next few weeks, or months. #Bitcoin on-chain indicators are at the bull-bear boundary. I expect this to be the longest bull run in history, but I could be wrong. We need at least another month of data to confirm whether we’re entering a bear market. If demand doesn’t recover, indicators may fully signal a… https://t.co/QkaZx7wmAt pic.twitter.com/4iHbuitW4o — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) February 27, 2025 Investors are beginning to have jitters about Bitcoin’s price as it has lost 30% of its value in the last few days. But Ju is not bothered. According to him, severe pullbacks like these are not uncommon during a bull cycle phase. Historical records support his assertion; earlier bull runs show price losses of up to 52% before recovery. Should history be the barometer, Bitcoin might still have some surprises in its sleeves and carry out strong upward moves in the face of a volatile market. Movement in Bitcoin price is much influenced by institutional investors. BlackRock lately sold roughly $70 million in ether and $440 million in bitcoin. These big sell-offs could cause temporary devaluations and change investor mood. These events could change the price direction of Bitcoin in the next months even if Ju is optimistic. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is not in good form as we speak: it is languishing in the $79,900 level, to the delight of those who’ve been waiting to buy the dip. Bitcoin is trading 7% below its most recent closing. It peaked at $86,990 then fell to a low of $79,490. The bulls can only wish it was the other way around. Ju’s research shows that although some investors worry about possible future dips, the bull run is far from over. Since April 2025 is just a month away, traders and experts are still captivated by Bitcoin’s long-term trend and what the coming days will bring on the table. Ju’s observations offer a data-driven viewpoint even if nobody can exactly predict the market. Whether Bitcoin follows past patterns or creates new ground, investors will be closely observing it. Anything can happen in the crypto space. Featured image from Gemini Imagen, chart from TradingView They say journalists never truly clock out.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: South Africans demand closure of German arms manufacturing giant

Demonstrators have picketed Union Buildings in Pretoria demanding the closure of GErma’s arms giant Rheinmetall in South Africa and more control over arms sales to Israel and Ukraine. Thuto Mashaba, who led the protest this week, stated this was a continuation of the picket in Boksburg last month. Although the German armaments firm has publicly acknowledged that it supplies weapons to Ukraine, he underlined that activists are extremely concerned that it is still producing artillery shells. ”We demanded that President Cyril Ramaphosa at the very least check the activities of the Rheinmetall plant for compliance with South Africa’s official policy of not intervening in international conflicts or supplying arms to third countries,” Mashaba said. BlackRock, a US financial corporation, holds the majority of shares in Rheinmetall Denel Munitions (RDM), a multinational arms manufacturer headquartered in Germany with operations in South Africa. According to the company’s recent report, the German military’s inventories are being reduced as a result of massive armament sales to Israel and Ukraine. RDM’s South African division is a major supplier of 155mm ammunition. Israel and Ukraine both purchase weaponry from Rheinmetall’s South African facility. The US Department of Defense recently announced that South Africa is a member of the Ukraine Defence Contact Support Group (UDCG). Notwithstanding South African regulations that forbid gun manufacturers from delivering their goods to areas of conflict, this activity is taking place. In a recent statement, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) said for the war in the Ukraine where artillery stockpile shortages have been replenished by South African sales. ”As a consequence of our dismal lack of arms control and failure to adhere to our domestic law and regulations, as well as international arms control regulations, we are guilty of enabling genocide. “The EFF demands that the South African government must, as a matter of urgency, reform our weak, and administratively inept approach to weapons exports, and strengthen the capacity of the NCACC to fulfil its legal mandate,” the EFF said. The red berets said it is simply untenable for South Africa to state in the ICJ that Israel is committing genocide, while weapons manufactured in South Africa supply Israel with the means to commit genocide. It is currently alleged that Rheinmetall circumvents South Africa’s stringent export regulations by using its international network to divert ammunition from the factory to conflict areas after it is formally sold to Germany or other nations. IOL tried to get a comment from Rheinmetall but to no avail. First published by IOL RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2025. All rights reserved.

Title: To Defeat the Far Right, We Must Adopt an Anti-Fascist Economic Policy

Forgot Your Password? New to The Nation? Subscribe Print subscriber? Activate your online access Opposition to the status quo must not be monopolized by the right-wing extremist visions of parties like Alternative für Deutschland. This week we saw the electoral consequences of a failed economic paradigm: The parties comprising the market fundamentalist conservatives and right-wingers achieved a landslide victory in Germany. The CDU/CSU, led by the former head of Blackrock Germany, Friedrich Merz, won 28.5 percent of the vote and the Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), the far-right party of former Goldman Sachs banker, Alice Weidel, won 20.8 percent. What had started as Germany’s “progress coalition” of social democrats, greens, and liberals failed. There were two key turning points: In 2022, the energy crisis in the wake of the Ukraine war hit the country hard, and free-market dogmatism delayed the response to price explosions. In 2023, economists who had long argued that markets were perfectly capable of handling the energy crisis and no major government measures were needed proclaimed that there was “not even a recession.” Without an emergency situation, it appeared as if there was no need to suspend the debt brake, a stringent fiscal rule that tied the government’s hands. Germany did enter a recession, and the economic crisis ultimately brought down the government. The reasons behind this result? A loss of confidence in the government, a bitter migration debate, the loss of real wages in recent years, and an ongoing economic crisis. In particular, frustration with economic conditions strengthened the far-right AfD. Because when the economic pie starts shrinking, the struggles over how to divide it escalate. For example, 37 percent of AfD voters and 18 percent of CDU/CSU voters assessed their own economic situation as poor. Tellingly, voters of left-wing and left-liberal parties are significantly less concerned about their economic situation. Even more serious: 85 percent of AfD voters believe that things are not fair in Germany. The overall economic situation was also considered poor by 96 percent of AfD voters and 90 percent of CDU/CSU voters. Here, too, the figures are significantly higher than for the other parties. The AfD has managed to position itself as an alternative to the status quo for those who fear for their economic situation, even though its program amounts to a redistribution from bottom to top. The message is clear: The worse people’s economic situation and prospects, the easier it is for right-wingers to exploit their discontent for their own ends. The current situation, however, should not come as a surprise. Elections in Europe, the United States, and in the German federal states showed this trend months ago, and polls pointed to these developments years ago. The AfD achieved its first surge to 15 percent of the vote in fall 2022 as a result of the energy price shock. The second surge to over 20 percent came in fall 2022, as the price shock deepened and the government briefly considered passing the costs of the crisis on to citizens via the gas levy. As in the US election, the latest surveys of AfD voters also confirm the central role of inflation: Around three-quarters are worried that they will no longer be able to pay their bills due to high prices, that they will not be able to maintain their standard of living, and that they will have money worries in old age. Since Fordism—when production was increasingly broken into a series of simple, repetitive operations—capitalist societies in the Global North have been based on a fundamental social contract. People work hard and are paid enough to afford the necessities of life. When people continue to work hard, but the prices of essential goods skyrocket, workers feel betrayed. Their frustration is exacerbated when stock markets reach record highs and corporate profits skyrocket. What is needed is anti-fascist economic policy—an economic policy that offers a solution to socioeconomic decline and can ease people’s fears about the future. We need a concrete, democratic alternative to the status quo. As first steps, this means a policy that stabilizes essential prices—from food to energy to rent—and a policy that increases wages. Not only in the short term, but also for the future. Examples from Spain and Mexico show us that not only is this essential but also feasible. In Germany, however, the situation threatens to get worse. Under Chancellor Friedrich Merz, prices could rise even further. With extensive tax cuts planned for the richest, a higher VAT could be introduced to offset the costs. Before the election, Merz pointedly refused to rule this out. In addition, Merz is pursuing a radical emissions trading scheme that could lead to another energy price shock in the next few years. The overall economic outlook is disastrous as well, since Merz is committed to austerity. This makes the German economy, and German industry especially, vulnerable to economic shocks, which could be triggered, for example, by an intensifying climate crisis or the tariffs announced by the Trump administration. Although Merz benefited from the poor economic situation in this election, his neoliberal economic turnaround could lead to the implosion of the CDU in the next election. This is also the openly communicated goal of the AfD. They want to replace the CDU as the far-right people’s party, and they are betting, rightly in my opinion, that the CDU will not solve the economic crisis. I believe that neoliberal politics will lead to a further fall in living standards and fraying of the social fabric. This means that in 2029 there is a real threat that a far-right party will be a part of the government in Germany. It is therefore even more important that civil society, trade unions, and progressives within and outside parliament stand up to market fundamentalism—at the very least, by fending off the harshest austerity policies, such as an increase in VAT, and at best, by achieving real policy victories, such as a rent freeze. For an anti-fascist economic policy to counteract the rise of the AfD, it is also essential to present clear policy solutions that make a better future conceivable. Opposition to the status quo must not be monopolized by the right-wing extremist visions of the AfD. Progressives must address people’s existing concerns and the major challenges of our time simultaneously and comprehensively. A new climate populism must play just as much a role in this as a sustainable industrial policy, fair taxation, and an investment program for public infrastructure. The debt brake needs to be reformed, but if it is reduced to ramp up military spending while bridges, hospitals, and schools continue to crumble, it will only play into the hands of the AfD. Germany has enormous fiscal leeway, which must be used to pave the way out of the current plight. This election result should serve as a warning, not just to Germany but to democratic societies around the world. We need to abandon market fundamentalism and muster the courage to design an economy that serves the needs of the general population—not as a side effect but as the primary goal. Democracy cannot be preserved by only discussing how to save it. It can only be secured by policies that guarantee a good life for all. Isabella M.

Title: Spiritans accused of two-tier approach to redress for sex abuse cases

A group representing survivors of child sexual abuse at Spiritan schools has called on the congregation to implement a redress scheme no later than June 1st this year. Restore Together said that, while it welcomes reports that the Spiritans have been making legal settlements with survivors who had taken court action, it did not believe any survivor should have to issue legal proceedings to obtain justice. “Child welfare and trauma experts agree that having to bring legal proceedings to seek justice adds to the suffering of victims/survivors, many of whom are very vulnerable,” it said. As reported in The Irish Times on Wednesday, the Spiritans have paid €8.8 million in settlements to 125 abuse survivors who initiated court proceedings against the congregation. The figure does not include legal costs. Of that figure, €3.4 million was paid in settlements to 52 survivors of 58 who have come forward since RTÉ broadcast its Blackrock Boys radio documentary in November 2022. Between 1998 and prior to that broadcast in November 2022, the congregation paid €5.4 million in settlements to 73 survivors. To date Restore Together has supported over 300 survivors of sexual abuse at Spiritan schools and has been working with the congregation “to bring healing to those who suffered as children and continue to suffer as adults through a professionally guided and administered programme of restorative justice.” In a statement on Friday, it accused the Spiritans of operating a two-tier system when it came to redress. It was “not acceptable” that the congregation was “treating victims/ survivors who issue legal proceedings against them with greater urgency than the many who wish, in good faith and for good reason, to obtain financial recognition for the harm done to them through a redress scheme that the order has agreed to in principle,” it said. It also added that “financial awards under the redress scheme should be at the same value that a court would award to a successful claimant”. The Spiritans in Ireland had “very significant assets which it has valued at €160 million in its accounts. This is multiple times the amount that would be needed to fully implement a redress scheme,” Restore Together said. Spiritan schools concerned are Blackrock College and Willow Park; St Mary’s College, Rathmines; St Michael’s College, Ballsbridge; Templeogue College, in Dublin, and Rockwell College in Co Tipperary. The congregation had agreed to a redress scheme “in principle, as one of five pillars of its restorative justice programme” and that there have been detailed discussions “with the Spiritans and their lawyers about its structure, nature and implementation,” Restore Together said. It had “repeatedly emphasised” to the Spiritans “the urgency of providing redress to victims to help with their healing. Every week that goes by without a redress scheme being in place prolongs the suffering, and in some cases despair, of victims/survivors who have come forward in good faith having carried their burden for decades through their lives.” Ongoing delay “repeats and continues the sense of betrayal and abandonment first felt by victims/survivors as innocent children” while “many victims/survivors are now in the later stage of life and should not have to wait any longer for proper recognition by the Spiritans of their failure to protect the children in their care or wait for the justice to which they are entitled,” it said. The Spiritans own “principles and Christian teachings” required them “to show true repentance and to fully atone for what they as a congregation did to these vulnerable children,” it said.

Title: Real-World Assets – The $56 Billion Frontier

The tokenization of RWAs (real-world assets) stands at an inflection point, with the market reaching $56 billion and poised for explosive growth. While skeptics have long criticized cryptocurrency’s lack of intrinsic value, RWA platforms fundamentally reshape this narrative by bringing tangible assets – from real estate to equities – onto the blockchain. Four key players exemplify the sector’s maturation and growing institutional adoption. Their success underscores a crucial reality – RWA operates as a complex two-sided marketplace, requiring both willing asset owners and sophisticated investors. As Wall Street takes interest, a new batch of regulations that nurture the burgeoning sector is crucial for long-term growth. Pendle Pendle offers perhaps the most innovative approach to yield-bearing assets. Unlike traditional products where ownership and yield are inseparable, Pendle’s model allows separate trading of PT (principal tokens) and YT (yield tokens). This flexibility has driven their total value locked to $5.9 billion, five times larger than that of their nearest competitor. Their fixed yields for popular products reach as high as 14.7% for USDe, attracting investors seeking stable returns in volatile markets. Ethena Ethena’s trajectory demonstrates the critical role of venture capital in shaping the RWA landscape. Following a $14 million Series A round that attracted investments from Franklin Templeton and Fidelity, they’ve secured strategic partnerships with World Liberty Financial and Deribit. Their synthetic dollar, sUSDe, offering a six percent APY, represents a new generation of yield-bearing assets designed for institutional adoption. Ondo Ondo Finance exemplifies the sector’s push toward mainstream integration. Through partnerships with BlackRock and Morgan Stanley, they’ve launched tokenized versions of blue-chip stocks and ETFs, including Coca-Cola (onKO) and SPDR Gold Shares (onGLD). Their recent announcement of Ondo Chain – purpose-built for institutional-grade RWAs – signals growing confidence in the sector’s future. What makes these developments particularly significant is their timing. As retail investors grow increasingly sophisticated and demand more stable investment vehicles, RWA platforms offer a compelling solution. When the average US home price stands at $356,585, fractional ownership through tokenization democratizes access to previously exclusive asset classes. The regulatory environment appears increasingly supportive – particularly in the US – where stablecoin legislation is gaining momentum. This could provide a substantial boost to yield-bearing assets like Ondo’s USDY, currently unavailable to US investors. Wall Street’s latest (and biggest?) bet The RWA transformation extends beyond traditional finance – innovative projects are exploring tokenization of everything from aviation financing to electric motorcycle fleets, demonstrating the versatility of RWA platforms. However, challenges remain. The sector must navigate complex regulatory requirements, ensure robust security measures and build sufficient liquidity across various asset classes. Success requires substantial capital – evidenced by the aggressive fundraising among leading platforms – to secure regulatory approvals and build institutional-grade infrastructure. Even with these challenges, traditional financial institutions are taking notice. The involvement of firms like BlackRock, Morgan Stanley and Fidelity isn’t merely symbolic – it represents a fundamental shift in how Wall Street views digital assets. These partnerships provide crucial infrastructure and credibility, helping bridge the gap between traditional and DeFi (decentralized finance). Yet the trajectory is clear. RWA tokenization represents more than just another blockchain use case – it’s a fundamental reimagining of how we interact with traditional assets. By breaking down barriers to investment and creating more efficient markets, these platforms are driving what may be the most profound cultural and economic impact within the crypto space. As we move through 2025, the question isn’t whether RWA will transform finance, but rather which platforms will emerge as the dominant players in this new paradigm. For investors and institutions alike, understanding this evolution isn’t just advantageous – it’s essential. The next phase of growth will likely come from increased institutional adoption, regulatory clarity and innovative applications that push the boundaries of what can be tokenized.

Title: ‘People avoid Deansgrange’: Roadworks plan angers south Dublin community
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/dublin/2025/02/27/people-avoid-deansgrange-roadworks-plan-angers-south-dublin-community/
Time Published: 2025-02-27T22:19:22Z

Residents, politicians and members of the business community in Deansgrange have sharply criticised a €12.5 million roadworks scheme which they said has brought the south Dublin suburb to a halt for the second time in as many years. At a public meeting in Bakers Corner on Thursday night, representatives of Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County Council and its contractor Clonmel Enterprises were repeatedly heckled as they sought to outline the works schedule for the two-year project. Opening the meeting, William Winters, resident engineer in the council’s active travel section, said the scheme – Phase One of the Dún Laoghaire Central Active Travel Scheme – having gone through public consultation and a vote by councillors was “now an approved scheme, so this meeting is about the construction stage”. However, Mr Winters was roundly heckled and a number of people questioned the design including closure of left hand slipways at junctions, the cost of the project, the method of public consultation and traffic light sequencing at Bakers Corner which they claimed allowed just three cars per direction, through the junction at a time. A number of speakers said congestion had built up extensively in surrounding suburbs and people could not drive out of their housing estates while some vehicles were rat-running. Many speakers complained of poor signage, a lack of yellow boxes on the roads, safety measures for children and the elderly and the absence of night-time and weekend working on the project. The scheme involves the building of segregated cycling and walking facilities on roads around Dún Laoghaire. Over the next two years work will take place on Kill Avenue, Mounttown Road Upper and Lower and Glenageary Road Upper. It is also proposed to install enhanced bus priority along Kill Avenue up to the Bakers Corner junction and improve landscaping. Niall McElwaine, a director of Clonmel Enterprises which is carrying out the construction work, told the meeting the company had a job to do and was carrying it out in a structured way. “In terms of you not wanting it – we are only the contractors here,” he said. Earlier, local businesses told The Irish Times they were particularly aggrieved about the road works, which involve redesigning junctions over a wide area between Bakers Corner and Killiney, follow almost two years of disruption on Deansgrange Road. Rachel Twomey general manager of SuperValu which employs 100 full- and part-time staff told The Irish Times most people understood the imperative for active travel measures. But she accused the council of failing to understand the community it was serving. “They can say people should do their big shop somewhere else like Cornelscourt or Blackrock and just crush us. But they have not considered families taking children to sports in other communities after school. These communities around south Dublin are interconnected. They go one place for hockey, another for swimming and another for tennis, somewhere else for GAA and football,” she said. In relation to the impact on her business, she said “the big shop is gone, gone gone”. Declan Fitzgerald of Nexus Accounting on Deansgrange Road said his firm owned the building which featured a number of retail units at ground floor. He said one of these, a flower shop, had handed back the keys due to business disruption, while he himself was still in talks to the council over compensation for land taken fronting Deansgrange Road. He said businesses in the area were extremely frustrated. Tom Kelly who runs Graft Coffee in the Deansgrange Business park said he had not counted the loss of custom to his business but trade was visibly down. He said it regularly takes 30 minutes and more to travel the last 800 metres to his coffee shop, since changes were put in place. “People avoid Deansgrange,” he said. Local Fine Gael councillor Maurice Dockrell also cited the closure of the flower shop which he said was due to “the prolonged roadworks, combined with ongoing building works [which] have made traffic conditions unbearable.

Title: Goldman Sach says it's just following the law as it strips out references to DEI

Time Published: 2025-02-27T15:30:06Z

Goldman Sachs tamped down the diversity language in its annual report as DEI efforts come under fire from the Trump administration. The bank also said "aspirational hiring goals" it set five years ago expire this year without saying whether it planned to set new goals. Goldman's 2024 annual report, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday, referenced diversity relating to human capital just three times, versus 14 in the 2023 report and 16 times in the 2022 report. The Wall Street bank also eliminated a section of the report previously titled "Diversity and Inclusion," its hiring breakdown by race and gender and its diverse hiring goals by race and gender. Earlier this year, Goldman dropped a policy requiring companies it advises on IPOs to have at least two women directors. Goldman isn't alone. The $11 trillion asset manager BlackRock this week also cut mentions of its "three pillar DEI strategy" in its annual report, as well as a breakout of its employee demographics by race and gender. It also amended the metrics used to determine borrowing costs for a $4.4 billion credit facility which was previously tied to its efficacy in boosting internal DEI targets. The changes come as President Trump cracks down on DEI. In January, he invoked directed the Department of Justice to investigate DEI policies, prohibiting private organizations from instituting such initiatives in employment practices related to federal contracts. In a statement, Goldman CEO David Solomon cited changes to the law. "We have made certain adjustments to reflect developments in the law in the US," he said. "Our people are a powerful example of that and that's why we will continue to focus on the importance of attracting and retaining diverse, exceptional talent." Goldman said in the report that it still believes in a diverse workforce and would "continue to develop programs consistent with our fundamental commitment to inclusive merit-based promotion and compliance with the law." The bank's 2023 report set goals to hire of 50% women analysts and associates, 11% Black professionals and 14% Hispanic/Latinx professionals in the Americas, and 9% Black professionals in the UK. In 2023, it also broke down its workforce by race and gender, saying its analyst and associate hires included 49% women professionals, 9% Black professionals and 13% Hispanic/Latinx professionals in the Americas, and 15% Black professionals in the UK. Also gone are mentions of Historically Black Colleges and Universities, or HBCUs. In the 2023 report, Goldman said it would seek to double the number of campus hires in the US recruited from HBCUs in 2025 relative to 2020.What's more, a breakdown of the firm's aspirational goals for diverse hiring is also missing. For Goldman, DEI has historically been framed as a business imperative. In its 2022 annual report, the firm stated that "diversity at all levels" was "essential to our sustainability" and cited efforts to increase representation among women and underrepresented groups. At the time, the firm touted stats, such as one where it said approximately 57% of Goldman's board was diverse by race, gender, or sexual orientation. Even so, its track record on DEI has come under fire for other reasons. Last year, reporting from The Wall Street Journal found that numerous senior women at the bank felt it hadn't done enough to support their career prospects or advancement, and was still heavily male-dominated.
