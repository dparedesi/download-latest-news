Hello, I’ll start with yesterday’s main political news: Andreas Loverdos joining New Democracy (ND). Loverdos has always been a centrist, moderate, low-profile politician who, wherever he served as a PASOK minister, left behind good impressions and some tangible results — how much or how little is subjective. He was terribly persecuted by the gang of his political opponents as well as common fraudsters in the Novartis case, but was acquitted only a short while ago. Obviously, ND had been waiting for his final acquittal before taking him in, but I have this question (and maybe you share it too): why in today’s PASOK — which is struggling at 12–13% and has lost dozens, if not hundreds, of capable centrist figures to ND — was there no room for Loverdos? What pushed him away? Because honestly, I don’t see any major ideological differences between ND and PASOK. Was it that “ready-Nikos” (Androulakis) didn’t want him? Did Loverdos seem superfluous? I don’t know where he will run or what luck he’ll have (though we wish him well), but compared to many we see and hear in PASOK today, Loverdos is in a different class altogether as a politician. And here’s a bit of info: two weeks ago, K.M. (Kyriakos Mitsotakis) had discussed Loverdos’ entry into ND directly with him and had promised it would go forward as soon as his court case was closed — and so it happened. “Bloodbath” in the South Loverdos’ addition to ND’s ballot in the Southern Athens Constituency really shakes up the deck. That’s where six ministers are elected (Dendias, Theodorikakos, Kyranakis, Spanakis, Theocharis, Anna Karamanli), two MPs (Kallianos, Voultepsi), plus two newcomers elected in May 2023 (Gaitanis, Gelefstathis). Also rumored: Stavros Papastavrou, former MEP Stelios Kympouropoulos, and Nikos Romanos had already announced his candidacy. In short: chaos. Taking it easy with Samaras As we approach elections, and given that Mitsotakis holds the lead in the polls at around 30% — double that of PASOK — he will increasingly try careful approaches on several… thorny outstanding issues (how more delicately can I put it?). For example: Maximos Charakopoulos as group representative in Parliament, showing up at Evripidis Stylianidis’ book presentation, and the next day at Patelis’ book. I asked about Samaras and the source replied: “That issue with President Antonis is delicate, sensitive, and very personal. K.M. wants to handle it himself with great care.” Without any extra info, I think the Mitsotakis–Samaras relationship within ND will now be approached very differently — led personally by the PM. KYSEA–Belharra Today’s KYSEA meeting (11:00) will be interesting, with focus on the migrant flow toward Gavdos and Crete’s southern coast. Plevris says that in the last two months alone, there have already been 1,500 deportations and voluntary returns. Also on the agenda: the likely “green light” for procurement of the 4th Belharra frigate, with Greece exercising the option included in the contract. Let’s see if in tonight’s ANT1 interview, K.M. says anything more about it. Normalization with Eugenios After some stormy months with the Church of Crete, yesterday’s meeting between K.M., Archbishop Eugenios, and Governor Arnaoutakis marked a “thaw” and gradual normalization. However, what was emphasized inside the meeting — reportedly held in a good atmosphere — is that the government will not withdraw the amendment regarding the immovability of the Metropolitan of Kydonia and Apokoronas, particularly Amphilochios of Kissamos. On the other hand, K.M. is said to have encouraged Eugenios to move forward with the person of his choice and close this divisive matter. London, Kikilias, and the Greek shipowners of the City As part of “London International Shipping Week,” Minister of Shipping Vassilis Kikilias was in London. On this occasion, Greek Ambassador to the UK Giannis Tsaousis hosted a dinner at the embassy residence in his honor. Among the 50 guests were prominent Greek shipowners in the City. First and foremost, Haralambos Fafalios, president of the Greek Shipping Cooperation Committee (known simply as “the Committee”), which this year celebrated 90 years of strong presence and remains a steady pillar of institutional advocacy and strategic support for Greek shipping. Also present: Dr. Nikos Tsakos (third vice president), Diamantis Lemos, Nikolaos Empeirikos, and members of the Mavroleon, Tsavliris, and Kerdos families, among others. In his speech, Kikilias promised reforms to reduce bureaucracy in registering ships under the Greek flag and to make the registry more competitive. To 6+4 of Hatzidakis to investors At yesterday’s Athens International Investor Summit organized by the Hellenic Corporation of Assets and Participations in collaboration with Blackrock, Vice President Hatzidakis (who had also taken the legislative initiative for the establishment of the Innovation and Infrastructure Fund with a “dowry” of 300 million), presented 6 comparative advantages of Greece to investors and 4 possible investment sectors. The 6 advantages are the high returns due to the investment gap, macroeconomic stability, the geoeconomic advantage (single European market and central position at the crossroads of Europe, Asia and Africa), the inflow of funds from the EU, the business-friendly government, political and institutional stability. As for the 4 sectors, beyond shipping, tourism, the food industry and pharmaceuticals, he mentioned energy, networks, defense and higher education. Let’s see the response. Countdown for National Bank – Negotiations with Piraeus Bank Let’s now move to other market matters starting with the National Bank, for which the column predicts it will play a leading role in banking developments in the second half of September. The column reports that intensive negotiations are currently underway between National Bank and Piraeus Bank to resolve their Gordian knot of bancassurance. The information is that there should be no doubt that the issue will be resolved and each bank will go its own way. Simultaneously with the agreement, National Bank is cutting the umbilical cord with National Insurance, as the always silent, never hasty and by nature cautious P. Mylonas is running a process for the acquisition of 20% of an insurance company with which it will work on bancassurance once it is freed from the ties of National Insurance and, by extension, Piraeus Bank. The column’s information is that the selection process of the insurance company that will be the new partner of NBG is advanced, and barring surprises the news will come before the end of the month. Five insurance companies are participating in the process, since the prize of exclusive cooperation with National Bank is coveted in the insurance market, especially after the reshuffling caused by the acquisition of Piraeus Bank. This also explains the participation of five insurance companies and is the reason for the confusion that arose among us journalists, with each one writing down a different company name — I suppose because each candidate company leaked the name of the competitor it feared. I stop here therefore and list the insurance companies taking part in the “marriage” process with National Bank, which are: Munich Re (ERGO), Alliance, NN, Interamerican and one more. The blitzkrieg deal of Credia Bank And if National Bank will take center stage in the coming days, Credia Bank is already in the spotlight today with its acquisition of HSBC Malta. There are two points of interest: The first is the price, since the market expected a price of 300 million and not 200 million. The second is the blitzkrieg deal achieved by Credia, as the Greek bank expressed interest in late July – early August stating that its offer would be valid for 15 days and that it wanted a direct and straightforward deal. On 15/8 the non-binding offer was submitted and on 16/9 the agreement was announced. Today the CEO of Credia Bank, E. Vrettou, speaks to analysts and will provide an official picture of the strengthening of ratios and figures. According to information, she will mention that the assets of the new bank will exceed 15 billion euros and – according to management’s estimate – the final recurring profitability of Credia Bank will be strengthened by approximately 90-100 million euros annually. The Czech’s investment in Box Now Emma Capital of Czech billionaire Jiri Smejc, known from its years-ago investment in OPAP, continues to maintain an investment presence in Greece and one of its investments, Box Now, seems to have paid off very quickly. The company, founded in 2021, has evolved into the largest player in the domestic smart locker market, attracting the attention of PCP, the investment arm of Olympia Group, which acquired a 12.5% stake in Box Now. Based on the published financial statements, the company’s turnover skyrocketed last year to 15.3 million euros from 2.9 million euros in 2023, a result of the rapid expansion of its smart locker network and the commercial agreements it secured. The investments being made affected the bottom line of the balance sheet, with losses at 5.8 million euros, reduced from the 8.6 million euros of the previous year. The investment for the development of Box Now so far exceeds 42 million euros and continues to expand throughout the country, with emphasis on island Greece. Emma Capital’s plan now also includes neighboring markets, and thus the until recently CEO of Box Now Greece, Dimitris Andriotis, has taken on duties as Group CEO for Greece, Cyprus, Bulgaria and Croatia, with the goal of faster growth in these countries. The Chinese secretary coming to Greece, the Americans and Piraeus From the Chinese embassy came into the dark room the information that “according to Xinhua News Agency, Li Xi, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and Secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the CPC, will make official friendship visits to Greece and Belarus from September 17 to 24, 2025. The visits will take place at the invitation of the New Democracy party of Greece and the Presidential Office of Belarus.” It will be interesting to see if the issue of the port of Piraeus will be discussed, which has been “targeted,” along with other Chinese-owned ports, by Washington, because it is located at a strategic point amid geopolitical turbulence. All the more so now, with tensions in Gaza at boiling point. COSCO has denied that its port units, which are on the U.S. blacklist, are related to the Chinese military, and insists its operations continue normally. The Greek side states it has no official information. Among the ports targeted by Washington are those in which China holds significant stakes, such as in Panama, but also in Europe – particularly in Greece and Spain – as well as ports on the U.S. West Coast and in parts of the Caribbean. There is concern at the Big Port. And the point is that when buffaloes fight, the frogs pay the price. Orgasm in Golden Visa issuances of commercial properties The plan is simple: We buy an old and abandoned commercial property (an old workshop, a small factory, a large retail store, etc.) in a neglected corner of Athens. We convert it into a residential property and thus obtain a Golden Visa without paying €800,000, since €250,000 is enough according to the law. The change of use from commercial or industrial property to residential constitutes a golden “way out” for those who wish to acquire a residence permit through the Golden Visa, with the only prerequisite being the completion of the conversion before the application. Information indicates that only in the first 7 months of 2025, only in Athens, a total of 17,254 Golden Visas were issued (+31.4% increase compared to 2024). This number concerns residence permits through real estate investment, with the greatest interest coming from citizens of Turkey, China and Israel. In July 2025 alone, 932 new Golden Visas were issued, marking the largest monthly increase of the last twelve months. The forgotten commercial properties of the capital come to life, their neighborhoods change appearance, the wider area comes to life. In August there was a slowdown due to summer holidays, but in September the surge continues. The green maneuvers of Greek shipowners I wrote in early September about the holistic green transition of shipping which the International Maritime Organization (IMO), led by Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez, wants to achieve by 2028. The effort is disjointed, the targets are considered unattainable and the most important thing is that there are no alternative fuels with zero CO2 emissions in production! The whole thing is in the realm of absurdity. Those who will not use such fuels will pay a tax into a special fund per ship and per carbon emission. And the question is where the large amounts collected will be channeled. The issue was raised by Vassilis Kikilias in the meeting he had the day before yesterday with Arsenio at the IMO headquarters in London. He told him that the IMO Net-Zero Framework requires corrective adjustments, since the lack of green fuels requires more realistic timelines, fair treatment of transitional fuels – such as LNG – as well as smart use of the reward mechanism. But the game seems lost. In fact, leading the international resistance against the IMO is none other than Donald Trump. Let’s see what we will see this coming October when everything will be played at the highest level. Meanwhile, Greek shipowners, faced with this Gordian knot, chose a middle-ground solution which has an expiration date. What did they do and what are they doing? They install scrubbers on their ships, reducing greenhouse gas emissions through filtering, until they see where things are going. According to analysts, about 900–1,000 Greek-owned ships are equipped with scrubbers, representing about 22% of the total. The main dilemma for Greek shipowners is how to make use of the existing investments in scrubbers at a time when the market is shifting to LNG, methanol, ammonia, hydrogen and biofuels. In short, their lines got crossed. Stock Exchange: Out of strength Not for a single moment of yesterday’s stock market session was there buying interest to bring the General Index into positive territory. It started with Coca Cola HBC (-2.42% at €42) which from the beginning of the session was losing €1 from its price. Immediately after, the systemic banks followed. It is characteristic that since Monday, August 25, when the sideways downward movement of the General Index began, the 4 systemic banks have been losing ground, but the non-systemic ones are gaining what the others lose. Logically tomorrow, an upward reaction of the systemics is possible, since technical analysis dictates that the Banking Index should not stray from yesterday’s closing at 2,202 points. In any case, the Banking Index – even today – records gains of +71.29%, a fact that allows not only the securing of profits but also rotation within the sector. Yesterday’s transaction value exceeded €183 million with €27.22 million in blocks, while the General Index ended the session at 2,033.23 points, with daily losses of -1.18%. It is a period of wars and geopolitical concerns, with turmoil in the debt market and currency shifts. In Greece, on Friday the September derivatives for indices and shares expire and the restructuring of the FTSE Russell and Stoxx indices is completed. The same day, late Friday night, Moody’s will publish its verdict on Greek creditworthiness, without particular expectations for surprises. With an “Italian scent” the pressures on bank shares Bank shares were in the crosshairs of sellers on the Athens Stock Exchange, as they were swept along by the “wave” of liquidations that hit banks across Europe. The source of the problem was Italy, where the Meloni government plans to burden the domestic sector with €3 billion over two years. With losses of 2.4% responded Intesa Sanpaolo, Mediobanca followed at -2.2%, Unicredit fell by 1.4%, while Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena moved lower by 2.8%. Some of Europe’s big banks reacted with even stronger liquidations. In Germany, Deutsche Bank slipped 3.3% and Commerzbank sank 4.2%. In France, Societe Generale led the losses at 3.7%, while BNP Paribas and Credit Agricole reacted more calmly with a decline of 1.7%. In Britain, Barclays fell 2.6%, Standard Chartered 2.3% and HSBC 1.2%. Spanish banks Banco Santander, Caixabank and Banco de Sabadell also lost more than 2%. Franchise agreements in Greek hotels All over Greece, old hotel units and complexes are signing franchise agreements with major foreign tourism groups, changing their appearance and offering a completely new product. International chains such as Hilton, Marriott, Accor, Wyndham and Radisson have already dynamically expanded their networks in the country. Already 50% of seasonal hotels have signed contracts for 2025 while 34% of them follow the commitment franchise model, committing 56% of their rooms at prices 8% higher compared to 2024. The new franchise deals concern acquisitions and upgrades of five-star units, such as the Golden Milos Beach in Milos by Domotel, or Radisson which is investing strongly in emerging destinations such as Mani. With these agreements, the quality of services and the equipment of the hotels are upgraded, while new tourist destinations are highlighted (e.g. Mani, Karpathos, Argolis). Franchise is evolving into a key driver of restructuring of our hotel market, upgrading the product and reducing the risk of overconcentration in Athens and the islands. In the age of over-optimism The latest available data show that 45.4% of American households have invested their savings in stocks. Even in the era of the big Dot.com “bubble” in 2000, the corresponding percentage was 38%. At a time when the S&P 500 Index is soaring to record levels, housing prices are at record levels, gold has broken every previous record, bitcoin is at unprecedented levels, American households are basing their prosperity on the expectation of continuous price increases. The “AI Euphoria” of recent years has outperformed the Telecom Bubble, even the Railway Mania of the 19th century. The latest Bank of America survey of fund managers (FMS) showed that the overwhelming majority of them believe that stock markets are overvalued. Yet they continue to invest, following the old saying of Chuck Prince of Citigroup: “as long as the music is playing, you have to dance.” …and suddenly Goldman Sachs “sees” gold at 5,000 dollars Goldman Sachs’ main estimate is that gold will reach 3,700 dollars by the end of the year. Suddenly, however, it put forward the forecast that gold could soar up to $5,000/ounce if the credibility of the U.S. Federal Reserve is shaken. Even if a small percentage (just 1%) of the private U.S. Treasury market shifts toward gold due to uncertainty, these flows are enough to drive the precious metal’s prices to unprecedented heights. Goldman Sachs estimates the total value of privately held Treasury market portfolios at about 57 trillion dollars. Therefore, such a shift by private investors toward the safe haven equates to an additional $570 billion in demand in the gold sector. In practice, the gold market is much smaller in size, so “overshooting” is quite likely. The political questioning of the Fed by President Trump and concerns over the independence of monetary policy constitute déjà vu for investors who historically turn to gold when they fear dollar devaluation or accelerating inflation. Many central banks are expected to increase gold purchases, preparing for possible monetary shocks. Explore related questions

Title: UK, US agree £31 billion tech pact to mark Trump's visit

Britain and the US have agreed a technology pact to boost ties in AI, quantum computing and civil nuclear energy, with top US firms led by Microsoft pledging £31 billion ($42 billion) in UK investments. The "Tech Prosperity Deal" is part of US President Donald Trump's second state visit to Britain, which will include a day of pomp at Windsor Castle today, hosted by King Charles and the royal family. Britain said the pact included joint efforts to develop AI models for healthcare, expand quantum computing capabilities and streamline civil nuclear projects. It added that it would support economic growth, scientific research and energy security in both countries. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the deal had the potential to shape the future of millions of people on both sides of the Atlantic, and deliver growth and security. The US is Britain's single largest country trading partner, and its big tech companies have already invested billions of dollars in their UK operations. Starmer, under pressure to reverse years of weak economic growth, now wants to pitch Britain as a destination for further investment by opting for the light touch regulation favoured by the US in areas such as AI, as opposed to the more interventionist approach of the European Union. The Trump administration has criticised European online safety laws and digital taxes, including those in Britain, but they were not part of the discussions over the pact. Under the deals announced, chipmaker Nvidia said it would deploy 120,000 graphics processing units across Britain - its largest rollout in Europe to date. It is working to deploy up to 60,000 Grace Blackwell Ultra chips with UK-based Nscale, which will partner OpenAI in a UK leg of the US company's giant Stargate project and tie-up with Microsoft to establish Britain's largest AI supercomputer. Microsoft said it would invest £22 billion in total to expand cloud and AI infrastructure as well as in the supercomputer, which will be in Loughton, north-east London. Satya Nadella, chair and CEO of Microsoft, said it wanted to ensure that America remained a trusted and reliable tech partner for Britain. Its president, Brad Smith, said relations had improved hugely since the "dark days" before the UK's antitrust regulator dropped its opposition to Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard, saying he felt "enormously better". David Hogan, vice president for enterprise at Nvidia, told reporters the investments would "truly make the UK an AI maker, not an AI taker". Google announced a £5 billion investment, including a new data centre in Waltham Cross, north of London, and continued support for AI research through its DeepMind project. Cloud computing firm CoreWeave said its £1.5 billion backing would fund energy-efficient data centres in partnership with Scottish firm DataVita, bringing its total UK investment to £2.5 billion. Other firms announcing commitments include Salesforce, Scale AI, BlackRock, Oracle, Amazon Web Services and AI Pathfinder, with investments ranging from hundreds of millions to several billion pounds.

BlackRock Inc.’s India venture with billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s group expects the nearly $900 billion local mutual fund industry to expand up to threefold over the next seven years, fueled by record inflows from domestic investors and a robust economy. Participation in Indian financial markets is starting to increase rapidly, much of that driven by digital platforms, according to Sid Swaminathan, chief executive officer of Jio BlackRock Asset Management, an equal alliance between Ambani’s Jio Financial Services Ltd. and the world’s largest asset manager. Asia’s richest man is seeking to reshape India’s financial services industry by leveraging his vast telecom and retail empire. For BlackRock, the tie-up marks a return to money management in the world’s fastest-growing major economy after its exit in 2018. The move coincides with a shift in household savings — once tied-up in gold and property — toward financial markets. The change has fueled an explosive growth in the domestic mutual fund sector, with assets more than doubling over the past five years. “Being in India at this point in its economic journey, there are so many tailwinds in our favor,” Swaminathan, who joined the venture after a 20-year stint with BlackRock in London, told Bloomberg News in an interview. India’s equity markets have more than doubled to $5.3 trillion over the last five years, drawing millions of retail investors. But Jio BlackRock faces stiff competition from entrenched fund houses backed by major lenders such as HDFC Bank Ltd., ICICI Bank Ltd. and State Bank of India, which command big distribution networks that reach small towns and villages. Online investment platforms such as Groww and Zerodha are also fueling the boom in direct mutual fund sales. Investor appetite, however, has been strong. The Jio BlackRock venture raised more than $2 billion in just three days for its debut funds in July, placing the alliance among the top 15 managers in that category. “For us to be operating in the next five years as a player of scale, it has to be about growing the market, rather than just capture market share from existing players,” Swaminathan said. That aim is shaping the asset manager’s approach: It is preparing a mix of passive and active strategies, with its first active equity fund set to launch next week. The product will draw on nearly 400 indicators on about 1,000 Indian stocks, building a portfolio broader than is typical for the category. In addition, it plans to launch a fund that rotates between sectors based on quantitative signals and is considering another one that systematically allocates between asset classes, Swaminathan said. The partnership hired Rishi Kohli, who headed hedge fund quantitative strategies at InCred Capital and Avendus, as its chief investment officer. The room for growth in systematic strategies is large in India, given the low starting point, Swaminathan said, describing the data-driven approach that also incorporates human judgment. As the market matures with more stocks and greater industry diversity, it becomes more conducive to such strategies, he said. The venture plans to use alternative data, from web-search activity to retail sentiment on online forums, and evaluate auditor quality when ranking firms. The Jio BlackRock partnership, spanning asset management, wealth management and equity broking, is pursuing a direct-to-consumer strategy via its app, bypassing traditional brokers and distributors. A sharp market decline could slow the sector’s expansion. Indian equities have significantly underperformed emerging-market peers in the past year, partly due to weak earnings growth and stretched valuations. Yet retail flows remain resilient, with monthly systematic investment plans topping $3 billion in August even as foreign funds retreated.

The visit comes as the UK and US prepare to sign a landmark technology agreement aimed at boosting cooperation between the two countries. By Caolán Magee and PA Share Save United States President Donald Trump has arrived in the United Kingdom for his second state visit, describing it as a “great honour” to be hosted by King Charles III at Windsor Castle. The US president landed at the London Stansted airport on Tuesday evening, where new UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper was among those greeting him as he stepped off Air Force One. Trump, accompanied by First Lady Melania Trump, is expected to stay overnight at Winfield House, the official residence of the US ambassador in Regent’s Park, before travelling to Windsor Castle on Wednesday for a ceremonial welcome and a state banquet. Thousands are expected to protest during his stay, though he has no public-facing engagements planned. Speaking to reporters before landing, Trump said: “My relationship is very good with the UK, and Charles, as you know, who’s now King, is my friend. It’s the first time this has ever happened where somebody was honoured twice. So, it’s a great honour.” The visit comes as the UK and US prepare to sign a landmark technology agreement aimed at boosting cooperation between the two countries’ multi-trillion-dollar tech sectors. Trump is expected to be joined by a delegation of US executives, including Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang and OpenAI’s Sam Altman, Reuters reported. Meanwhile, Sky News reported that BlackRock plans to invest $700m in British data centres as part of a series of announcements tied to the state visit. The UK was the first country to sign a bilateral trade agreement with the Trump administration in May. Under that deal, Washington pledged to reduce tariffs on aluminium and steel from 25 percent to zero, though the changes have yet to take effect. Trump has hinted at possible tariff relief for UK steel ahead of talks with Prime Minister Keir Starmer at Chequers, the prime minister’s country residence, on Thursday. “I’m there also on trade. They want to see if they can refine the trade deal a little bit. We’ve made a deal, and it’s a great deal, and I’m into helping them,” Trump said. Follow Al Jazeera English:

Stargate UK builds on this foundation to help accelerate scientific breakthroughs, improve productivity, and drive economic growth. This partnership reflects our shared vision that with the right infrastructure in place, AI can expand opportunity for people and businesses across the UK. Josh Payne, Nscale CEO said: We’re delighted to announce Nscale’s commitment to UK AI infrastructure today, including through Stargate UK and building the most powerful supercomputer in the country with Microsoft. As a UK-based company, we’re showing how we can be makers, not takers, of the most important technology of our time. Rene Haas, CEO of Arm: The launch of Stargate UK represents a critical step in expanding Britain’s AI computing power and digital infrastructure. As a company founded and headquartered in the UK, Arm is proud to be at the forefront of the nation’s semiconductor plans and to be a technology partner for Stargate UK, delivering the computing platform that makes scalable, energy-efficient AI possible. Satya Nadella, Chairman and CEO, Microsoft: We’re committed to creating new opportunity for people and businesses on both sides of the Atlantic, and to ensuring America remains a trusted and reliable tech partner for the United Kingdom. That is why we are doubling down on our investment in the UK, investing more than $30 billion over 4 years, including building the country’s largest supercomputer. This follows renewed commitments from US companies Oracle and Amazon Web Services in the UK. Oracle has committed to expanding the AI infrastructure it provides to the UK government reaffirming their $5 billion investment over the next 5 years. Whilst Amazon also earlier this year announced a commitment to build and operate data centres across the UK with an £8 billion investment. Showcasing how British technological excellence drives prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic, UK-based quantum computing company Oxford Quantum Circuits installed New York City’s first quantum computer, in collaboration with NVIDIA and Digital Realty, and launched a pioneering Quantum-AI Data Centre just within the city. US quantum firm IonQ is setting up its EMEA headquarters and a new R&D and manufacturing hub in Oxford, following a $1 billion merger with UK start-up Oxford Ionics. The investment will create high-skilled jobs, boost UK quantum exports, and is a flagship example of US/UK collaboration in next-generation technologies. Michael Intrator, Co-Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of CoreWeave: Our investment in the UK will establish one of the world’s largest concentrations of state-of-the-art, sustainable compute, unlocking new opportunities for innovation, economic growth, and scientific discovery. It allows us to deliver unparalleled AI performance with the lowest possible environmental impact, setting a new global standard. We look forward to collaborating with the UK government and the broader ecosystem to drive the next wave of responsible AI leadership around the world. Marc Benioff, Chair and CEO, Salesforce: We are doubling down on our long-standing commitment to the UK with this significant investment. We’re delighted that the UK, already a vital talent and innovation centre, will become our AI hub for Europe, driving product innovation for customers across the region. James Seppala, Chairman of Blackstone Europe, said: We are delighted that the government has designated our hyperscale data centre campus in Northumberland as an AI Growth Zone.

The partnership will see AI models developed by NASA and the UK Space Agency (UKSA) to support science and exploration missions, like those on the moon and Mars. The deal will also create new opportunities for business and investment, as both countries look to scale up their AI infrastructure. This will be a boost to British businesses behind the infrastructure, like those creating the next generation of semiconductor chips that power AI all the way to those who operate data centres and other compute resources. The partnership will deepen the collaboration between the UK and US governments on advancing the science of AI security and promoting secure innovation – including by exchanging world-leading talent and expertise. By working together and alongside industry to develop standards we can promote the prosperity of consumers and the safety of our citizens, ensuring that the UK and US lead the world in understanding and harnessing advanced AI. In support of the US-UK science and technology partnership, Google DeepMind will work with both governments to advise on how scientists can harness the latest AI tools in their work - as well as continuing their partnership with the UK Atomic Energy Authority to advance fusion energy research in the US and UK. The UK and US will partner to develop revolutionary quantum computers and speed up the deployment of this technology across areas like healthcare, defence and finance. This will boost healthcare, protect citizens and create highly skilled jobs. For example, millions of patients could receive life-saving treatments faster thanks to this groundbreaking deal. Traditional drug discovery takes years and costs millions because it relies on simulating countless molecular interactions. Quantum computers can speed this up dramatically by simulating molecules more accurately and quickly than ever before. Quantum tech is already saving lives, including by helping to study and treat epilepsy and dementia or providing clearer insights into our brains for brain scans. This UK–US partnership could unlock even faster breakthroughs, bringing life-changing treatments to patients sooner and transforming the future of healthcare. Under the deal, the 2 countries will establish a taskforce of the UK and US’s top researchers to discover and accelerate breakthroughs in quantum technologies. An exchange programme across industry will also be created to spur adoption across defence, health, finance, and energy. Through the combined strength of national labs, the genius of British and American scientists, and the agility of leading companies, we can deliver unmatched innovation and keep our countries safe, prosperous, and leading the pack. The partnership will turbocharge the build-out of new nuclear power stations to secure jobs and growth in the UK and US. New deals between UK and US companies announced this week have been enabled by the partnership, which will make it quicker for companies to build new nuclear power stations by speeding up the time it takes for a nuclear project to get a license. The partnership also extends to fusion energy, where British and American expertise will fast-track progress towards commercial fusion power. This golden age of nuclear is central to the government’s mission to build more clean homegrown power to ensure energy security.

Title: SharpLink stock dips following latest buyback, Ethereum stash hits $3.8B

Funding another buyback push, SharpLink's Ethereum balance sheet swells to $3.86 billion, enticing long-term growth strategies. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Shares of SharpLink Gaming fell slightly even as the Ethereum treasury firm pressed forward with its ambitious stock repurchase program, buying another 1 million shares. The company, which trades under the ticker SBET, said the latest purchases were executed at an average price of $16.67 each. Despite the move, SharpLink’s stock slipped 2.8% to $16.32 by late afternoon in New York. The buybacks are part of a $1.5 billion authorization approved in August. To date, the firm has retired nearly 1.93 million shares for about $32 million, funding the purchases with cash reserves, staking income, and other financing rather than debt. Alongside the buybacks, SharpLink continued to build its Ethereum balance sheet. The firm reported holding 838,152 ETH as of Sept. 16, up from 740,760 tokens a month earlier, with a total value of about $3.86 billion. The figure includes 3,240 ETH earned through staking since June. The company, backed by Ethereum developer Consensys, is the second-largest corporate holder of ETH after Bitmine Immersion, which controls more than 2 million tokens. Together, the two firms account for the majority of Ethereum kept on the books by the roughly 70 public digital asset treasury companies that own at least 100 ETH each. SharpLink said it will only repurchase shares when its net asset value (NAV) falls below 1 — a level it considers a signal that the stock is undervalued compared with its crypto holdings. As of Sept. 15, SBET’s NAV stood at 0.91x, meaning the market was valuing its shares at about 9% below its ether reserves. Buybacks have become increasingly common among digital asset treasuries, though they remain controversial. Critics say they risk prioritizing short-term price support, while SharpLink CEO Joseph Chalom, a former BlackRock executive, argues the program is “immediately accretive” and strengthens long-term shareholder returns. SharpLink shares surged earlier this year after announcing a partnership with Consensys, briefly topping $78 in June, but have since pulled back. The company said it remains committed to aligning shareholder value with Ethereum’s growth, underscoring its strategy of using token accumulation and selective buybacks to “buy low and sell high.” AJ, a passionate journalist since Yemen's 2011 Arab Spring, has honed his skills worldwide for over a decade.

Title: Trump Postpones TikTok Ban Enforcement for Fourth Time as He Claims ‘We Have a Deal’ With China to Sell App’s U.S. Operations to ‘Very Big Companies’
URL: https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/tikotok-ban-trump-postpones-enforcement-deal-app-1236520948/

Consortium including Oracle, Silver Lake and Andreessen Horowitz would own 80% of TikTok U.S., WSJ reports By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor TikTok U.S. is poised to get a new ownership structure — and a new app for American users — if the Trump administration’s much-delayed efforts to ink a deal to comply with a federal law banning Chinese control of the app go through. President Donald Trump, speaking with reporters Tuesday outside the White House, said, “We’ve got a deal on TikTok. I’ve reached a deal with China.” He said there are “very big companies that want to buy it.” Trump said he is going to speak with Chinese president Xi Jinping on Friday “to confirm everything.” Related Stories Film Movement Takes North American Distribution Rights for Cannes, Toronto Title 'Renoir' (EXCLUSIVE) Film Fests' New World Order: Why Cannes and Venice Surged as Toronto and Sundance Have Struggled Since the deal isn’t final yet, Trump is again postponing his administration’s enforcement of the TikTok divest-or-ban bill — the fourth time he’s done so — pushing the deadline out 90 days, from Sept. 17 to Dec. 16. Popular on Variety Trump did not provide details on TikTok U.S.’s potential new owners. According to a Wall Street Journal report, TikTok’s U.S. business would be 80% owned and controlled by an investor consortium including Oracle, Silver Lake and Andreessen Horowitz. In addition, current ByteDance investors including Susquehanna International, KKR and General Atlantic, would be part of the 80% ownership group. Chinese shareholders including ByteDance would own the remainder, according to the Journal report, which cited anonymous sources. The new TikTok U.S. company would have a U.S.-dominated board that includes a member designated by the U.S. government, per the WSJ report. U.S. and Chinese officials met for trade talks Monday in Madrid, where China’s top trade negotiator, Li Chenggang, told reporters the two sides had reached a “basic framework consensus” for a deal to keep TikTok available in the U.S., according to a Reuters report. Reps for TikTok and ByteDance did not respond to requests for comment. Under a U.S. law that went into effect Jan. 19, 2025, it is illegal for American companies to host or distribute TikTok in the country as long as it remains controlled by Chinese parent company ByteDance. The legislation passed last year with overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress, on fears that the popular video entertainment app’s ties to China‘s communist regime make it a national security risk. It was signed into law by President Biden. The Trump administration has been trying to reach a deal to restructure TikTok U.S.’s ownership in a way that complies with the law while also being an arrangement that will be acceptable to the Chinese government. ByteDance has said 60% of its ownership is represented by global institutional investors including BlackRock, General Atlantic and Susquehanna, with 20% owned by its Chinese founders and 20% by employees including those in the United States. The U.S. divest-or-ban law prohibits distribution of any app in which companies or individuals located in a country that is a “foreign adversary” to the United States “directly or indirectly own” at least a 20% stake. The transfer of ownership would result in TikTok’s current U.S. users having to download and install a new app, which will be wholly separate from the app as it exists in the rest of the world, per the Journal. The U.S. version of the app will have a content-recommendation algorithm that uses technology licensed from ByteDance, while Oracle will continue to manage and host TikTok’s U.S. data. Trump, in the final months of his first administration, tried unsuccessfully to ban TikTok unless its ownership was transferred to U.S. companies. But after the 2024 election Trump said “I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok,” because “there are those who say” the app helped drive support for him among young voters.

(Bloomberg) -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc’s co-chief for the Middle East and North Africa and one of its top asset-management executives is set to leave the bank. Fadi Abuali is departing the New York-based firm after almost 28 years with the company, according to an internal memo. A Goldman spokesperson confirmed the contents of the memo. Abuali was instrumental in expanding Goldman’s franchise in the Middle Eastern and North Africa since he was appointed co-CEO for the region alongside Zaid Khaldi almost five years ago. The bank opened an office in Abu Dhabi in 2023 and last year became the first Wall Street lender to secure a so-called regional headquarters license in Saudi Arabia. Earlier this year, Saudi Arabia’s sovereign-wealth fund agreed to anchor Goldman’s new private-credit and public-equity strategies in Saudi Arabia and the wider Gulf. As part of the bank’s push into Middle Eastern private credit, it is relocating London-based executive Deb Dutt to the region, Abuali said in a recent interview. Goldman asset managers in the Middle East have been in high demand, with Khalid Albdah, head of Goldman in Saudi Arabia and co-head of the regional asset-management arm, leaving late last year for Neuberger Berman. Earlier in 2024, BlackRock Inc. tapped Mohammad Al Fahim, who oversaw Goldman’s Abu Dhabi branch, to head its operations in the United Arab Emirates. Aside from the Middle East and North Africa, Abuali also jointly ran Goldman Asset Management’s international arm, serving as a key lieutenant to Marc Nachmann, global head of the bank’s asset- and wealth-management business, and was global co-head of the asset-management institutional-client business.

Title: Mitsotakis: Reliable and costed fiscal policy is a fundamental principle

Time Published: 2025-09-16T14:40:27Z

The impressive growth dynamics of the Greek economy were mentioned, among others, by the Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, who participated today in a discussion with BlackRock Vice President Philip Hildebrand and Adebayo Ogunlezi, chairman and CEO of Global Infrastructure Partners, at the Athens International Investors Summit investment conference, organised by Yperat Fund and BlackRock. He stressed that the fundamental principle is a reliable and cost-effective fiscal policy so that fiscal and macroeconomic stability is not questioned, that the benefits from the fight against tax evasion are returned to citizens, while he also highlighted the importance of defense, which he called the supreme European public good. The Prime Minister also had the opportunity to address, before powerful investment players with broad portfolios, the country’s prospects, investment opportunities, and challenges in several sectors, and the issues of green transition and energy. During the forum, the establishment of the Hellenic Innovation & Infrastructure Fund, which is the investment arm of the Super Fund, was announced. “We are growing at a much higher rate than the eurozone average, while at the same time reducing taxes, focusing on private investment, promoting entrepreneurship and improving the business environment,” the prime minister said during his remarks. “We have achieved all this in an environment of political stability. We have a government with an absolute majority. In 2023, the citizens rewarded us by giving us a new mandate. I think this sets us apart from many other European countries, because coalition politics can be very complicated,” Kyriakos Mitsotakis continued. “I think the big challenge, from a political point of view, is to link the macroeconomic situation to everyday life and work, in an environment where the cost of living has become a big problem,” the prime minister stressed. “I think there is a general understanding that this page turn is here to stay. My job is to ensure that the changes we have implemented are irreversible. That’s my commitment to the investment community and, frankly, the main reason why I want to seek a third term. To ensure that what we have achieved continues and that the wealth we are creating for the country is maintained. My first commitment in 2023 was to raise wages. When I see unemployment falling from 18% to 8%, that means that real wages are rising, Kyriakos Mitsotakis noted. “This is the only way to truly distribute wealth,” he added. Referring to the importance of reliable and cost-effective fiscal policy, the prime minister noted: “The fundamental principle of our approach has always been not to question the pursuit of fiscal and macroeconomic stability. The 2009-2010 crisis was a consequence of the spending derailment and our failure to focus on fundamentally restructuring our economy. We will not repeat the same mistake, ever. That is why our commitment to generate primary surpluses and, whenever possible, fiscal surpluses, will not be challenged.” The Prime Minister also stressed that the benefits of the fight against tax evasion are returned to citizens through systematic tax cuts, with an emphasis on middle incomes, young people and families with children. “The biggest reform that has contributed to the state budget has been our ability to address the problem of tax evasion. This brought a lot of money into the public coffers, which we now have to return to the citizens. So we reduced taxes for the middle class. We have reduced taxes for families with children. We have reduced income tax to zero for those under 25 years of age. I want to encourage young people to join the workforce; I don’t want them to wait years. I respect young kids who go to technical school and enter the workforce at age 20. I want them to know that we are thinking about them,” he said. During the debate on the future of European defence, given the current geopolitical landscape, the prime minister said: “We will need to mobilise not only private but also public funds. We will need to mobilise European public resources for defence. I have been clear on this issue; I have spoken about it on many occasions. The recent incursion of Russian drones into Polish airspace has brought to the fore something that we already know is a major problem, and that concerns missile defence and air defence systems in Europe. Therefore, my proposal is very clear: a pan-European tool for what I consider to be a pan-European good. And defence is the ultimate European public good. We cannot allow our national priorities to become an obstacle to tackling what is essentially an existential threat to Europe. Can this happen? The answer is that I see much greater potential. Some of the traditionally ‘frugal’ countries, such as Denmark and Finland, are much more open to the idea of joint European defence borrowing.” Kyriakos Mitsotakis also addressed, among other things, the issue of green transition and energy. “Greece has been extremely successful in adding renewable energy sources, both solar and wind, to our energy mix. We produce more than 50% of our electricity from renewable sources. Especially in spring or autumn, we have the possibility of having all our electricity generated for hours from renewable sources. For the first time this summer, we have also seen greater price convergence between Western, Central, and South-Eastern Europe,” the Prime Minister said. “We need more interconnections. We have become net exporters of electricity. This has never happened before. But, of course, we will need additional investments in baseload – in the case of Greece, we are talking about natural gas – and of course, investments in storage. This is the plan as to how we intend to proceed with the green transition in a realistic way, but also taking into account that for us, renewable energy sources constitute an important comparative advantage,” he added.

Bengaluru: Snapdeal, run by AceVector, is relying on strong growth in fashion and apparel to strengthen its position in the competitive e-commerce space, especially during the high-stakes festive season when customer loyalty is low. According to CEO Achint Setia, the company has seen its fashion and lifestyle categories triple in growth this year, though exact figures remain undisclosed. Bengaluru: Snapdeal, run by AceVector, is relying on strong growth in fashion and apparel to strengthen its position in the competitive e-commerce space, especially during the high-stakes festive season when customer loyalty is low. According to CEO Achint Setia, the company has seen its fashion and lifestyle categories triple in growth this year, though exact figures remain undisclosed. “Fashion has been a standout category this year and, in fact, has been possibly the fastest-growing one so far. Overall, lifestyle [including fashion, home decor, and kitchen] already accounts for 90% of our business today, and fashion is a major driving force," Setia told Mint in an interview. Setia was appointed to the role in January, replacing Himanshu Chakrawarti, who led Snapdeal and its subsidiary Stellaro Brands for three years. Setia has over two decades of experience across marketing and strategy roles in firms like Myntra, Viacom18 Media, and Zalora Group.

If they don't get it, or if they have to refile, they'll need to update their IPO documents with a full year of financial data. This means the festive season performance will be key in shaping investor sentiment, especially in a volatile market," said a senior e-commerce executive, asking not to be named. Key Takeaways Snapdeal parent AceVector's IPO hinges on festival season performance and small-town fashion demand. Fashion and lifestyle now account for 90% of Snapdeal’s business, with value pricing as a core strategy. Meesho, Flipkart, and Amazon dominate the same geographies Snapdeal targets. Snapdeal is avoiding quick commerce, focusing instead on improving delivery speed within its current model. Experts remain unconvinced of Snapdeal’s differentiation or growth potential in a crowded market. AceVector filed its draft papers for an IPO reportedly to raise ₹500 crore through the confidential route in July, which allows it to withhold public disclosure of IPO details until later stages. Setia declined to comment on the progress of the filing. Despite its early entry, Snapdeal is yet to make a mark among the top e-commerce players in the country by both market share and volume of transactions. For context, industry estimates show Flipkart as the market leader with 48% share, followed by Meesho and Amazon. The Indian e-commerce market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21% and reach $325 billion in 2030, as per an October 2024 report by Deloitte. Long way to goFounded in 2010 by Kunal Bahl and Rohit Bansal, Snapdeal was initially launched as a daily deals platform and later pivoted to a full-fledged marketplace in 2011. Over the years, it raised more than $1.8 billion in funding from SoftBank, Alibaba Group, Foxconn and BlackRock, among others. However, intense competition and the absence of a distinct growth strategy have gradually eroded Snapdeal’s momentum in the e-commerce space. Snapdeal largely caters to cities outside metropolitan areas where value retail has picked up in recent years. Within this, fashion remains the top growth driver—with more than 80% of orders placed priced below ₹599 and 80% of them coming from small town India, according to CEO Setia. “For us, it’s about the value-conscious mindset that could be sitting out of anywhere," he noted. Over the last few months, Snapdeal has invested substantially in in-house festive campaigns, as well as technology and tools for returns forecasting and logistics. According to Setia, it has also expanded its seller portfolio, adding more from key clusters like Tirupur, Surat, Ludhiana, and Agra. According to a September 2024 report by market research firm Centrum, the mass-market fashion segment accounts for 56% of India’s total apparel market. However, offline continues to account for more than half the sales, with Tata’s Trent, D-Mart, and Vishal Mega Mart offering a sufficient selection of price-conscious consumers in smaller towns. While small-town India offers a wide online shopping-savvy market waiting to be captured, Meesho has raced past Snapdeal in those geographies, especially in value commerce. “For a very long time, Snapdeal has been positioned as an e-commerce platform for Bharat, but it doesn’t necessarily hold a strong position. Meesho, Flipkart and Amazon have expanded their presence in these markets over the years, which means competition is so much more now," said Devangshu Dutta, founder and chief executive officer at consulting firm Third Eyesight.

We don’t see it having a lot of market share or path to rapid growth in a crowded market unless they somehow differentiate or pivot to some other innovative approach, in a highly value-conscious market," Sharma added. Under stress, Snapdeal has made several attempts to revive its position. In 2016, it spent as much as ₹200 crore to rebrand and create a new brand identity, but very little changed. In FY24, Snapdeal’s revenue was flat at ₹379.6 crore, while losses narrowed nearly 43% to ₹160 crore, aided by lower expenses. Quick commerceWhile the e-commerce market gradually shifts to faster deliveries, Snapdeal remains unfazed. The firm will not look to enter the quick commerce race, stating that a market for all kinds of online commerce exists. “We are continuously exploring what our customers want. But at this point, we are focused on our current model while trying to improve delivery speed and experience. A lot of our orders are already delivered the next day. Having said that, quick commerce isn’t a priority because the inventory stock model is a different ballgame," said Snapdeal’s Setia.

Despite its early entry, Snapdeal is yet to make a mark among the top e-commerce players in the country by both market share and volume of transactions. For context, industry estimates show Flipkart as the market leader with 48% share, followed by Meesho and Amazon. The Indian e-commerce market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21% and reach $325 billion in 2030, as per an October 2024 report by Deloitte. Long way to goFounded in 2010 by Kunal Bahl and Rohit Bansal, Snapdeal was initially launched as a daily deals platform and later pivoted to a full-fledged marketplace in 2011. Over the years, it raised more than $1.8 billion in funding from SoftBank, Alibaba Group, Foxconn and BlackRock, among others. However, intense competition and the absence of a distinct growth strategy have gradually eroded Snapdeal’s momentum in the e-commerce space. Snapdeal largely caters to cities outside metropolitan areas where value retail has picked up in recent years. Within this, fashion remains the top growth driver—with more than 80% of orders placed priced below ₹599 and 80% of them coming from small town India, according to CEO Setia. “For us, it’s about the value-conscious mindset that could be sitting out of anywhere," he noted.

According to a September 2024 report by market research firm Centrum, the mass-market fashion segment accounts for 56% of India’s total apparel market. However, offline continues to account for more than half the sales, with Tata’s Trent, D-Mart, and Vishal Mega Mart offering a sufficient selection of price-conscious consumers in smaller towns. While small-town India offers a wide online shopping-savvy market waiting to be captured, Meesho has raced past Snapdeal in those geographies, especially in value commerce. “For a very long time, Snapdeal has been positioned as an e-commerce platform for Bharat, but it doesn’t necessarily hold a strong position.

Title: Hyperliquid Turns Up The HYPE —And The Heat On Circle’s USDC
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonegilsson/2025/09/16/hyperliquid-turns-up-the-hype--and-the-heat-on-circles-usdc/
Time Published: 2025-09-16T11:48:15Z
Full Content:
ByJon Helgi Egilsson, Contributor. HYPE, the governance token of Hyperliquid—a decentralized trading platform—has surged more than 1,500% in less than a year, reaching a market cap of $16 billion. Appropriately named, HYPE now sits at the center of a shift in stablecoins. Yesterday, Native Markets was selected through a validator vote to issue USDH, Hyperliquid’s first native stablecoin. The decision matters less for the issuer itself — a relatively new player — than for what it signals: stablecoin economics are changing, and established issuers such as Circle, whose USDC dominates Hyperliquid today, may feel the pressure. Hyperliquid holds about $5.97 billion in USDC balances, equal to roughly 8.2% of USDC’s total supply. Based on current federal funds rates, those deposits would generate more than $250 million annually in interest income for Circle and its partner Coinbase. USDH is designed to redirect that yield into Hyperliquid’s own ecosystem. If adoption succeeds, Circle could lose a substantial revenue stream while Hyperliquid strengthens its independence from external providers. Circle knows the stakes. CEO Jeremy Allaire responded on X: “Don’t Believe the Hype… We are coming to the HYPE ecosystem in a big way. We intend to be a major player and contributor to the ecosystem.” As Lucas Tcheyan of Galaxy Digital observed: “The competition for USDH underscores a shifting dynamic in stablecoin issuance where issuers must increasingly pay for distribution. Issuers are portraying themselves as indispensable partners, but in reality, they need Hyperliquid more than Hyperliquid needs them.” The process drew proposals from well-known names such as Paxos, Frax, Ethena, Sky (formerly MakerDAO), and Agora. Most offered to return nearly all reserve income — up to 100% — to win the mandate. Native Markets took a different approach, pledging a 50/50 split: half of the yield will go to Hyperliquid’s Assistance Fund, which buys back HYPE, and half to ecosystem growth initiatives. So it’s not all going to HYPE — but HYPE is still the clear beneficiary. Buybacks directly support the token, while ecosystem programs are intended to encourage wider use of USDH, reinforcing the same outcome. CoinGecko’s Vera Lim noted: “The outcome demonstrates the importance of ecosystem alignment and native knowledge over pure financial incentives in DeFi governance decisions.” The reserves will be managed through Stripe’s Bridge platform, with custody by BlackRock. Both MiCAR in Europe and the GENIUS Act in the U.S. prohibit stablecoins from paying interest to stablecoin holders. The aim is to ensure these instruments act as payment tools rather than investment products, and to protect bank deposits. On the surface, USDH complies. It is redeemable at par and pays no interest to holders. But in practice, the reserve income will be rerouted through HYPE buybacks and ecosystem subsidies. This is why some see the design as a circumvention of the rules. Yes, regulators prohibited stablecoins from paying yield directly; Hyperliquid has instead created a structure where the yield supports a governance token tied to the stablecoin’s adoption. Functionally, it introduces the same incentives regulators wanted to avoid. But the parallel with corporate America, including Circle, is worth noting. USDC holders receive no yield, but Circle’s shareholders benefit when USDC grows, since the company invests reserves in Treasuries. The difference is that Hyperliquid’s model makes the link explicit, folding it into the economics of its governance token. For readers unfamiliar with the platform, Hyperliquid is a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on its own blockchain. It has quickly become the leading venue for decentralized perpetual futures, with around 70% market share and monthly volumes approaching $400 billion. Until now, the network has relied almost entirely on USDC. That dependency has meant billions in deposits flow to Circle and Coinbase, even though the activity is generated within Hyperliquid. USDH is intended to capture that value internally while reducing reliance on external, permissioned stablecoins. The USDH vote points to three broader trends. First, issuers must now increasingly pay for adoption. Stablecoins are no longer judged only by trust in the issuer but by how much value is returned to the ecosystems where they circulate. Second, regulation lags design. MiCAR and GENIUS assume stablecoins can be kept in a non-interest-bearing model. USDH shows how quickly new structures can emerge that satisfy the letter of the rules while challenging their intent. Third, governance tokens matter. HYPE’s 1,533% surge reflects not just speculation but the market’s expectation that yield, even if banned on paper, will find its way back to users and investors through other channels. The 50/50 split ensures not all yield goes to HYPE, but it leaves the token as the central beneficiary. On paper, Native Markets won the USDH mandate. In practice, the validator vote underscored how stablecoins are evolving into ecosystems where yield is too valuable to leave untouched. MiCAR and GENIUS sought to prevent stablecoins from competing with bank deposits by banning interest payments. USDH shows how difficult that goal will be to enforce. The design makes a formal distinction between “money” and “investment,” yet blurs it in substance by turning stablecoin adoption into a source of yield for the community — a role once reserved for bank deposits.

Title: Franklin Templeton Bets Blockchain Will Transform Asset Management
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/christerholloman/2025/09/16/franklin-templeton-bets-blockchain-will-transform-asset-management/

ByChrister Holloman, Contributor. The payments and asset management industries are undergoing a fundamental reset. A report from McKinsey published this summer finds that stablecoins and tokenized cash are emerging as serious challengers to incumbent infrastructure, with transaction volumes forecast to reach as much as $250 billion per day within three years. That inflection point is forcing banks, asset managers, and technology providers to move quickly or risk irrelevance. Few incumbents are leaning in as aggressively as Franklin Templeton. The firm’s head of digital assets, Roger Bayston, says blockchain technology is not a side project but a new foundation for how securities, funds, and collateral will be issued, traded, and managed. Roger Bayston, Head of Digital Assets at Franklin Templeton Bayston recalls that Franklin Templeton’s early work in the space was pure R&D. The question was basic: What could distributed ledgers do for an asset manager? The answer was equally basic at first, eliminate costly reconciliations and duplicative ledgers that plague capital markets. But once the regulatory picture began to shift in the U.S. earlier this year, the firm moved from exploration to commercialization. “The biggest challenge we faced for years was the regulatory construct,” Bayston said. “That changed dramatically after the first of the year. Now it’s about focus, delivery, and scaling what we’ve incubated into real products.” Franklin Templeton’s showcase product is Benji, the blockchain-enabled representation of its U.S. Government Money Fund. Instead of holding shares in a brokerage account, investors hold a token in a digital wallet. Transfers are nearly instantaneous, and the fund pays intraday yield calculated down to the second, a feature impossible in legacy systems. While the concept may sound niche, demand is growing. Early adopters include crypto-native firms and exchanges looking for a yield-bearing alternative to stablecoins in collateral management. Bayston noted that these clients want to post collateral that earns income, not sit idle. In practice, that means Benji can slot into derivatives and lending markets where stablecoins dominate today. McKinsey’s report highlights exactly this convergence. Yield-bearing, tokenized cash equivalents are becoming popular complements to traditional stablecoins, with Franklin Templeton, BlackRock, and Ondo among the early movers. For Bayston, tokenization is not just about faster money funds. It is about transforming what investors can own, “We’ve updated transfer agency infrastructure with blockchain,” he said. “Now, previously illiquid or non-fungible assets, from private funds to fractional ownership of a sports team, can potentially be wrapped into a client portfolio alongside traditional securities.” Natalya Thakur, is CEO of Knova which provides the API infrastructure layer that unifies traditional and tokenized assets, helping institutions manage, automate, and transact across all asset types in real time and she commented, “Franklin Templeton’s launch of Benji shows how tokenization is making even the most traditional products, like government money funds, more dynamic and interoperable. Institutions are seeking to integrate tokenized and traditional assets into a single operational stack, where yields can be optimized and collateral can move instantly. Tokenized funds like Benji will thrive when paired with infrastructure that lets firms orchestrate them side-by-side with securities, stablecoins, and deposits.” That idea echoes McKinsey’s thesis that tokenized money, deposits, and securities could reshape capital markets, treasury operations, and even cross-border remittances. The implications extend beyond cost savings to entirely new product categories and customer segments. Franklin Templeton has already launched multiple versions of Benji, including U.S. and European Union structures. Early traction is strongest in crypto-native markets where the instrument is used as collateral, but Bayston envisions adoption in public markets as regulations catch up. He points to recent developments like the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation and the U.S. GENIUS Act as accelerants. With clearer rules, tokenized funds can coexist with, or even displace, stablecoins in mainstream financial plumbing. Bayston avoids bold five-year predictions, but he is confident about the near term. Franklin Templeton has built a tokenization platform across public and private funds. The next step is deploying it widely across its asset management businesses. “We know the wallet ecosystems have hundreds of millions of customers we don’t touch today,” Bayston said. “Meeting their needs is a tremendous opportunity for us.” The McKinsey report argues that 2025 could be the year stablecoins and tokenized assets cross into the financial mainstream. For Franklin Templeton, the shift is already underway. By blending plain-vanilla money funds with blockchain rails, the firm is proving that tokenization is not just a theory but a functioning business model. If other incumbents hesitate, they may find themselves disrupted not by fintechs but by peers willing to rewire their infrastructure for the digital era.

Title: Coinbase’s XRP Decline Continues: 90% Crash In Exchange’s Reserves Tells Story Of Investor Accumulation
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/coinbases-xrp-decline-continues/
Time Published: 2025-09-16T00:00:46Z
Full Content:
Coinbase’s XRP reserves have witnessed one of the strongest collapses among major crypto exchanges, and this has caused questions as to where the tokens are going. According to on-chain data, the exchange’s cold wallets now hold only a fraction of the XRP they once did, and the decline is now more than 90%. This comes at a time when the XRP community has been closely monitoring institutional activity, with growing rumors of BlackRock and other heavyweight firms quietly building exposure to XRP. Recent moves by Coinbase with its XRP holdings have taken most crypto investors by surprise. Previous data showed that Coinbase, which was once the fifth-largest holder of XRP, has trimmed its XRP reserve balance from approximately 780.13 million XRP to 199.47 million. This was a cutback of about 69% in its holdings since the second quarter of 2025. However, on-chain data tracked by the @XRPwallets account on the social media platform X shows that Coinbase hasn’t stepped back from slashing its XRP holdings. As recently revealed by @XRPwallets, Coinbase now has just six cold wallets holding about 16.5 million XRP each. This leaves the US-based exchange with an estimated 99 million XRP in total. By comparison, the exchange had 52 cold wallets as recently as June 9, with 10 wallets holding 26.8 million XRP each and another 42 wallets holding 16.8 million XRP each. Combined, that amounted to nearly 970 million XRP under Coinbase’s control. In other words, the most recent numbers mean that Coinbase has shed about 90% of its XRP reserves within the past three months. Such a strong reduction in the movement of XRP away from Coinbase has been linked to accumulation into institutional wallets in anticipation of the launch of a Spot XRP ETF in the US. It also corresponds with previous reports about BlackRock’s indirect involvement with XRP through Coinbase’s custodial services. The scale of outflows from Coinbase’s XRP reserves has taken many crypto investors by surprise, as seen by comments on social media platforms. For instance, XRPwallets hinted at the possibility of these huge movements being linked to BlackRock. An account on the social media platform X, known as Stern Drew, suggested that Coinbase’s sell-offs go with a deliberate strategy to suppress XRP’s price. This was met with a firm rejection by pro-XRP lawyer Bill Morgan, who was quick to push back on the manipulation claims. Although there has been no official confirmation, the most plausible explanation of these large XRP exits is mostly linked to the eventual launch of an XRP ETF. The odds of the SEC accepting an XRP ETF in 2025 are now at a 94% chance on Polymarket. Bloomberg analysts also place the odds at a 90% chance or higher. Large institutions could be accumulating XRP in anticipation of such a product, and the reduced supply on exchanges could contribute to buying pressure even before it is launched. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $3, down by 2.9% in the past 24 hours. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Should We Ban Quarterly Reporting?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/shivaramrajgopal/2025/09/15/should-we-ban-quarterly-reporting/
Time Published: 2025-09-15T23:53:55Z
Full Content:
ByShivaram Rajgopal, Contributor. The move confuses corporate investing myopia with the frequency of reporting One of the new policy initiatives that has garnered much attention is to cancel quarterly reporting by publicly listed firms. The motivation appears to be the need to get out of “quarterly capitalism” or CEOs focused on beating quarterly estimates of EPS, instead of worrying about beating overseas firms that have a much longer horizon of decades when they make investment decisions. 1.0 This was tried in the UK Before we do anything, it is useful to learn from the experience of other advanced markets that have tried this before. The UK, in 2014, banned mandatory quarterly reporting and went to a six-monthly cycle. My co-authors, Suresh Nallareddy, and Bob Pozen, and I studied the observable consequences of that change. Here is what we found: 2,0 Will less frequent reporting curb the real causes of investment myopia, if any? Part of the confusion stems from the real causes of investment myopia. In my mind, the real policy problems, underlying investment myopia, are as follows: 2.1 Expensing investments in intangible assets Capital market participants pay attention to earnings numbers. Earnings numbers, in the US, co-mingle signals about current operating performance and investment outlays. That is, investment in R&D and human capital in SG&A lines are expensed as per US GAAP. This leads, all else constant, to cutting investment outlays in intangibles to make the earnings numbers look good. Expanding the reporting window to six months will not improve investments, as we found. Why? Most investments have a three year or a five-year payoff horizon. Are we willing to allow firms to report once in three to five years? Most likely not. 2.2 A company’s investors are rarely that company’s frequent traders In my class, I often show students the list of a firm’s top 10-25 owners relative to funds that traded the most quarter. The largest owners for big companies are predictably the large index funds such as BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street. Traders are usually hedge funds. Going to half yearly reporting might potentially lead to even more trading by hedge funds who are more interested in predicting near term stock price changes rather than long term fundamentals. This may even lead to greater opportunities for managers to exploit inside information to time their trades or the firms’ financing activities. 2.3 CEO and CFO tenure is down CEO and CFO tenure in the US are at historic lows, at six and four years respectively, for all sorts of reasons other than reporting frequency. If your expected term with a firm is 16 quarters, of course quarterly reporting matters. Many CEOs I have chatted with complain that it will take five to six years for any of their investment initiatives to bear fruit. Half of them will be gone by then. Unless we can somehow change CEO and CFO tenures, tinkering with reporting frequency will do little. 3.0 Other mitigating factors 3.1 Compliance costs are coming down If the concern stems from compliance costs, things are only becoming easier. With AI and back-office automation, we can get to even more frequent reporting than a quarter, should we want to. 3.2 Markets lose a check in point for the company Quarterly reports validate or refute short term narratives that investors or traders have in a stock. Losing that avenue for checking on the progress or lack thereof of such a narrative will only increase return volatility. Return momentum on imprecise or simply wrong narratives will run for longer. As and when evidence against that narrative comes out, either via six monthly reports or from some other source, the crash in the stock price will be more vicious than otherwise. Frauds will take that much longer to discover when the firm can legally perpetuate radio silence. In sum, I worry that the debate confuses investment myopia with reporting frequency. Going to six monthly mandatory reporting is not a silver bullet. Instead, we must get to grips with the changing nature of capital markets, traders and managerial incentives.

Title: Ethereum Faces September Profit-Taking Risks Despite $638M ETF Boost

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Ethereum (ETH) continues to capture institutional attention as strong inflows into spot ETFs highlight the growing demand. According to SoSoValue, Ethereum funds recorded $638 million in net inflows between September 8–12, 2025, with Fidelity’s FETH leading at $381 million. This marked the fourth consecutive week of gains and pushed cumulative Ethereum ETF inflows above $13.3 billion. While the inflows strengthen Ethereum’s long-term investment case, historical trends and on-chain signals suggest September profit-taking risks may resurface. Despite trading near $4,520 on September 15, ETH faces mixed market signals that could dictate its next major move. Ethereum ETFs are becoming a major part of the crypto market, with total assets under management surpassing $30 billion. Fidelity and BlackRock accounted for most of the latest inflows, while Grayscale and Bitwise also recorded steady gains. Institutional accumulation continues to reshape Ethereum’s market dynamics. Exchange reserves have dropped to their lowest levels since 2016, reflecting reduced selling pressure as more ETH flows into long-term holdings. Additionally, over 36 million ETH, about 30% of supply, is staked, further tightening liquidity. Despite the bullish inflows, history paints a cautious picture. September has typically been a weak month for ETH, with a median return of -12.7% since its launch. Current on-chain data supports this caution: the percentage of ETH supply in profit recently peaked near 99%, signaling overheated conditions. Past profit peaks have often led to 8–9% pullbacks. Furthermore, derivatives data shows Ethereum trading within a rising wedge pattern, a structure that often precedes corrections. Key support lies at $4,485 and $4,382, while resistance levels target $4,760 and $4,945. Ethereum’s fundamentals currently remain strong. ETF inflows, whale accumulation, and shrinking exchange supply provide structural support. If ETH holds above $4,700, cascading liquidations could propel a move toward the $4,900–$5,000 range. However, traders must remain cautious. With September’s track record of corrections and elevated profit-taking signals, Ethereum could face short-term volatility even as its long-term case strengthens. Ethereum’s next test will be whether it can sustain momentum beyond September, breaking the cycle of seasonal weakness while capitalizing on growing institutional demand.

Title: Dragonfly’s Haseeb proposes holder scores, crowdsales to replace current airdrop model

Haseeb Qureshi advocated for meta-incentives based on users' historical token behavior rather than platform-specific metrics. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Dragonfly managing partner Haseeb Qureshi proposed a reputation system to reward users on token distributions through airdrops. On a Sept. 15 post via X, he shared a reform plan to filter airdrop farmers who dump tokens immediately after launches. Qureshi responded to Aztec CMO Claire Kart’s critique that airdrops “tank your chart” and provide “lazy alignment” by drawing parallels to IPO allocation methods. Companies offer institutional investors like BlackRock preferential pricing because these firms demonstrate long-term holding patterns, while retail investors pay market prices due to unpredictable behavior. Qureshi stated: “It’s crazy that token distributions don’t work this way.” He advocated for meta-incentives based on users’ historical token behavior rather than platform-specific metrics. The Dragonfly partner proposed standardized holder scores tracking token retention curves, governance participation, fee spending, liquidity provision, and product usage across multiple protocols. Projects would publish these scores in JSON format, enabling other teams to incorporate reputation data into distribution decisions. Qureshi argued that this creates accountability across the ecosystem. Users who know about future airdrops consider their holding history when modifying their behavior toward long-term commitment rather than immediate selling. Credit bureaus operate similarly, with financial institutions sharing customer data to encourage responsible behavior. The framework recommended limiting free airdrops to under 15% of total token generation events while selling the majority through score-tiered crowdsales. Better holder scores receive larger allocations at lower prices, while mercenary farmers pay full price or receive no access. Qureshi stated that the proposal addresses fundamental airdrop problems by requiring skin in the game. Users paying for tokens create committed holder bases versus recipients of free money seeking immediate exits. Crowdsales also provide built-in sybil resistance, as creating thousands of farming accounts becomes economically prohibitive. He acknowledged airdrops remain useful for pay-for-performance scenarios requiring specific measurable activities like total value locked or trading volume. However, Qureshi concluded that broad “helicopter money” distributions only attract artificial activity that disappears after token launches.

Title: XRP’s Market Cap Beats Out Heavy Hitters In Climb Into 100 Top Global Assets — Here Are The Numbers

XRP has climbed back into the top 100 global assets by market cap, surpassing some notable names, following its reclaim of the psychological $3 level. This comes amid a broader crypto market rally, which has sparked hopes of a continuation of the bull run. Companies Market Cap data shows that XRP’s market cap is larger than that of the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, and also Sony. The altcoin’s market cap is currently at around $182 billion, while BlackRock and Sony boast a market cap of $173 and $174 billion, respectively. Meanwhile, based on its market cap, XRP currently sits as the 88th largest asset, just behind Xiaomi. It is worth noting that the altcoin has briefly surpassed banking giant Citigroup, Verizon, and Shopify following a rally of over 3% over the weekend. However, XRP has pared some of these gains and now looks to be consolidating in preparation for the next leg to the upside. XRP’s rally comes amid a broad crypto market rally, with other major altcoins like Ethereum, Dogecoin, BNB, and Solana recording significant gains. Some fundamentals could serve as a catalyst for higher XRP prices, as its market cap looks to surpass more companies on the global assets ranking. This includes the launch of the REX-Osprey XRP ETF that is set to take place this week. This will be the first U.S. XRP fund to provide institutional investors with spot exposure to the altcoin. This is expected to inject new liquidity into the XRP ecosystem. Meanwhile, the Fed is expected to make a rate cut at this week’s FOMC meeting. This is typically bullish for altcoins for XRP, although there is also the possibility that it may be a ‘sell the news’ event. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has predicted that the XRP price could rally to $3.6 following its breakout above $3.05. He had earlier stated that there were two possible scenarios. One possibility is that it could break above $3.05 and then rally to $3.60, or it could dip to $2.80, break above $2.90, and then rally to $3.60. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Dark Defender highlighted $3.01 and $2.85 as the major support levels to watch out for as the XRP price prepares for another leg to the upside. The analyst stated that the targets are the $4.39 and the $5.85 Fibonacci levels. A rally to these price levels would mark a new all-time high (ATH) for the altcoin.

September 15, 2025 12:35 ET | Source: Impulse Space Impulse Space REDONDO BEACH, Calif. and SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Impulse Space, the leader for in-space mobility, and Astranis, manufacturer of advanced high-orbit satellites, signed a contract today for an upcoming mission to GEO. Targeting a 2027 launch, the mission will utilize a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launch to low Earth orbit (LEO), where it will deploy Impulse’s Helios kick stage. Leveraging chemical propulsion via its powerful Deneb engine, Helios will then deliver Astranis MicroGEO satellites from LEO to GEO in less than 24 hours, deploying them to their target orbital regime in geostationary orbit. This mission will showcase the capabilities of Astranis and Impulse to rapidly deploy satellites to geostationary orbit without the use of a Heavy-class rocket, a mission profile appealing to government and commercial customers alike. Astranis satellites provide dedicated, secure, enterprise-grade communications from GEO for customers around the world. Geostationary orbit allows a single satellite to provide 24/7 operational service, but reaching that orbit requires traversing the radiation-laden Van Allen Belts that surround the planet. Traditionally, Astranis satellites have used efficient but low thrust electric propulsion thrusters to make the orbit raise maneuver, which can take months. By using Helios to rapidly transit between orbits, Astranis will avoid the cost and risk of a slower transit, instead arriving at the target destination in a matter of hours after launch. “We selected Impulse’s Helios vehicle for this mission because it offers a faster, more reliable, and more cost-effective way for us to get our satellites operational and delivering service to customers,” said John Gedmark, co-founder and CEO of Astranis. “Demonstrating new methods of rapidly deploying satellites to geostationary orbit is important for both our government and commercial customers, and Impulse is the perfect partner for us in this effort.” “This is exactly the type of mission that Helios is designed for,” said Eric Romo, President and COO of Impulse Space. “By providing rapid transport to higher energy orbits, we help operators like Astranis to begin delivering on their mission promise sooner. And with our vertically-integrated approach to design, manufacturing, and testing, we offer reliability and schedule assurance to further de-risk the mission profile.” Astranis will be flying as the primary payload on the mission, with the potential for secondary payloads to be added later. About Impulse SpaceImpulse Space, the in-space mobility leader, is accelerating our future beyond Earth beginning with its fleet of cost-effective, high-performance space vehicles: Helios and Mira. The Helios kick stage unlocks high-energy orbits with its powerful Deneb engine, rapidly transporting payloads from LEO to MEO, GEO, heliocentric, lunar, and other planetary orbits. The flight-proven Mira enables precise maneuverability and rapid responsiveness for hosting, deployment, and rendezvous and proximity operations (RPO) across any orbit. Founded by Tom Mueller and led by a team of industry pioneers, Impulse Space is transforming in-space mobility by reliably and rapidly getting customers where they want to go. And they're just getting started.

Title: Flexport Projects 2025 Profit from Convoy Sale, Eyes More Market Share by 2026

By Glenn Taylor Flexport anticipates it will be in profitable in 2025 thanks to the freight tech company’s sale of the Convoy freight-matching platform. The digital freight forwarder targeted profitability by the end of this year, with CEO Ryan Petersen telling the Wall Street Journal that the Convoy sale was a “one-time event” that “was more than our burn rate for this year.” Flexport sold the once-defunct freight booking platform to DAT Freight & Analytics for $250 million, flipping it nearly two years after acquiring the technology stack out of insolvency for roughly $16 million. Without the Convoy sale, Flexport would not be able to reach its 2025 profitability goal, Petersen said. The founder said the company is now on track for a profitable 2026 driven by organic growth as it expands into new countries, cuts costs and seeks to take more market share from larger competitors in the freight forwarding industry like DHL, C.H. Robinson, Kuehne+Nagel and DSV. According to the WSJ article, Flexport opened an office in Indonesia earlier this month and plans to launch in six additional countries in 2026. The company’s growth is contingent on an industry that has been hit heavily by decreased demand and slower shipping volume growth in recent years, ultimately resulting in lower freight rates. Package delivery titans like UPS and FedEx have been hit hard by the demand shifts, with both implementing mass cost-cutting efforts to save billions of dollars and improve efficiency.

Customers had to suspend or stop freight bookings altogether when the U.S. tacked “reciprocal” duties on imports from trade partners worldwide in April, before rushing orders into the country again after the tariffs were given a three-month delay. The back-and-forth resulted in a brief (and early) peak shipping season that saw year-over-year cargo growth at U.S. ports in July, before inbound volumes began their downturn starting in August. Air freight at Flexport took a hit as well, not just from the tariffs, but from the closure of the duty-free de minimis provision. The Trump administration banned the trade exemption for low-value shipments out of China at the start May, before putting a stop to the provision for any foreign goods headed to the U.S. in late August. As volumes on the Asia-to-U.S. trade lane suffered, Flexport moved less air cargo for its clients. “Air freight prices are quite low because of the end of de minimis shipping,” Petersen told CNBC in a Friday interview. “That was a huge percentage of the world’s air freight that’s more or less gone away.” According to Petersen, Flexport’s warehousing and customs brokerage businesses have benefitted from the U.S. trade policy shifts. Flexport’s gross profit on its customs brokerage and compliance business is up 99 percent year over year in 2025. From a financial perspective, Flexport had still been losing money prior to the Convoy deal. Shopify’s earnings results in August indicate that the e-commerce company incurred a net loss of $24 million on its Flexport investment in the second quarter. Those results are reported on a one-quarter delay, meaning the loss came in Flexport’s April-to-June quarter. Combined with the quarter prior, Shopify lost $47 million over the latest six months reported by Flexport. In total, Shopify’s investment in Flexport is $595 million as of June 30, down from $642 million six months prior. Given that the tech titan has a 17 percent stake in Flexport as of Sept. 30, 2023, Flexport’s estimated valuation stands at $3.5 billion, still a far cry from its peak of $8 billion in February 2022 when the company hauled in a $935 million Series E funding round. As the company hopes to improve its fortunes in 2026, is expanding its supply chain financing business by partnering with asset management firm BlackRock. With the team up, Flexport is expanding financing options for companies facing higher tariff costs and other trade-related strains on cash flow. BlackRock-managed funds and accounts will provide $250 million to Flexport within the partnership, nearly doubling Flexport’s current lending capacity, the companies say. The freight tech firm’s financial services arm, Flexport Capital, has provided more than $2 billion since it started in 2017. The BlackRock partnership will last four years, and allows financing across various points of companies’ supply chains through purchase orders, inventory pickup, freight movement, warehousing and final delivery.

The streak ran across all five trading sessions from September 8 to September 12, according to aggregated data from Farside and SoSoValue. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust led with just over $1 billion of inflows, while Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund brought in nearly $850 million. Other issuers, including Ark Invest and Bitwise, also posted gains, though smaller. Daily flows showed steady demand. Monday started with $364 million, followed by a muted $23 million on Tuesday. The pace accelerated to $742 million on Wednesday, $553 million on Thursday, and $642 million on Friday. Last week’s inflows “signal clear demand impulse, the one that looks both meaningful and timely,” Georgii Verbitskii, a derivatives trader and founder of decentralized protocol TYMIO, told Decrypt. With September to October marking “the start of the business season,” Verbitskii notes that the this “often sets the tone for trends that play out through the end of the year.” The base case, he added, is that this could be “the beginning of a new uptrend, with strong potential for further growth into Q4.” Still, while the inflows show a marked return to mid-July levels, “the number itself isn’t transformative on its own,” Wesley Crook, CEO of blockchain engineering firm FP Block, told Decrypt. “Much of this activity is being driven by expectations of rate cuts alongside the broader trend of enterprises entering the market,” Crook said, adding that he expects the momentum to likely continue as institutional allocations for Bitcoin bring “upward pressure on prices.” The surge aligned with growing expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut rates at its next meeting set this week, with users of prediction market Myriad, launched by Decrypt’s parent company DASTAN, placing an 88% chance on a 25bps rate cut. During the same period, Bitcoin's price recovered above $115,000, reinforcing investor optimism. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is changing hands at around $114,600, per CoinGecko data. “Structural demand is the real story here,” Farbod Sadeghian, founder of Dubai-headquartered international virtual asset chamber TheBlock., told Decrypt. While rate cut expectations could provide “a friendlier backdrop for risk assets,” such a setting is temporary, Sadeghian said. “The bigger factor is that investors, especially at the institutional level, now see Bitcoin as an allocation worth holding over the long term,” he said, adding that “the ETF wrapper makes it easier and safer to access, but the underlying appetite is clearly about exposure to the asset itself.” On the broader end, Sadeghian notes that Bitcoin ETF inflows, while “never perfectly smooth,” could expect to “stabilize and scale further” over macro-driven momentum as institutional investors steadily “integrate Bitcoin ETFs into standard portfolios.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.
