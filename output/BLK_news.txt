Title: JPMorgan is jumping deeper into crypto with a new tokenized money market fund

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. JPMorgan is set to offer clients access to a tokenized money market fund as part of Wall Street's latest crypto push. The bank announced that its asset management arm will launch a tokenized money-market fund that will run on the ethereum blockchain. My OnChain Net Yield Fund (MONY) will be supported by Kinexys Digital Assets, the bank's tokenization platform. MONY will hold short-term debt and issue daily interest payouts in the same way traditional money market funds do. The key difference lies in the fact that its shares will exist on the ethereum blockchain network, and investors can redeem them using either cash or the USDC stablecoin. The new fund, which The Wall Street Journal reported will be offered to wealthy clients and institutions, will have a minimum investment of $1 million. Its launch is the latest crypto move from the bank, which also recently tokenized some private equity investments in October. It's also the latest crypto push from Wall Street broadly. Asset management titans, including Franklin Templeton, Fidelity, and BlackRock, have also been offering crypto investments and blockchain solutions for clients. JPMorgan will commit $100 million of its own capital to the fund before officially opening it up to investors on December 16. Despite some skepticism from CEO Jamie Dimon over the years, the bank has made inroads into crypto and has been recently bullish on the price of bitcoin. JPMorgan analysts said recently that bitcoin could buck its latest downtrend and reach $170,000 in 2026. Asset tokenization has been in focus in 2025, with platforms like Robinhood framing it as a means of trading more efficiently or potentially gaining exposure to private investments. The passing of the GENIUS Act, meanwhile, has offered support for stablecoins, a key component for tokenized funds like MONY. Jump to

Title: Trump could announce a new Fed chair before Christmas: Here’s what you need to know about the leading candidates
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/12/15/fed-chairman-candidates-hassett-warsh-waller-rieder/
Time Published: 2025-12-15T16:08:21Z
Full Content:
The White House has run a very public campaign for the nomination of the next chairman of the Federal Reserve. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has been open about how swiftly he would like to see a name chosen and shared with the public, while President Trump has been transparent about the individuals in contention. One motivation for the candor is a bid to shift focus away from current chairman Jerome Powell, who has grated on the Oval Office by refusing to cut rates as fast as Trump might have liked.With this in mind, Bessent in particular has lobbied to announce the Fed nomination sooner rather than later, even saying the announcement could be made before Christmas. With 10 days to go, that now seems unlikely, and the president has indicated the decision will instead be made in early 2026.Even over the weekend, The Wall Street Journal reported Trump is eyeing two candidates in particular—Kevin Hassett and Kevin Warsh—for the job. Here’s what you need to know about the top contenders, and what their on-record opinions have been about the running of the Fed. Kevin Hassett has been seen broadly as the frontrunner in this race. As director of the White House National Economic Council (NEC), Hassett claims he speaks with President Trump daily, and his appointment to the NEC suggests that Trump already values his outlook. Hassett knows how to work with politicians, particularly Trump. From 2017 to 2019 he served as chairman of the president’s Council of Economic Advisors, and then was enlisted by the White House to serve as a senior advisor on the coronavirus pandemic. He has also worked with a roster of Republican politicians, serving as John McCain’s chief economic advisor in 2000, adviser to George W. Bush in 2004, and to Mitt Romney in 2012. The conservative economist has also worked within the Fed before, in the 1990s, though not in decision-making or senior positions, unlike some of his rivals. Hassett’s allegiance to the White House raises questions for investors, who generally prefer central banks that are firmly independent of politics. Like his peers, Hassett has expressed a dovish outlook on rates, which aligns with President Trump’s way of thinking. The economist has also said he would take the views of the Oval Office directly to the Fed, while maintaining that it won’t sway the internal due diligence of the institution. Speaking on Face the Nation yesterday, Hassett said: “I think he has very strong and well-founded views about what we ought to do. “But in the end, the job of the Fed is to be independent and to work with the group of people that are on the Board of Governors, at the FOMC, to drive a group consensus on where interest rates should be … with the guidance of the Fed chair. But in the end, it’s a committee that votes. “And I’d be happy to talk to the president every day … until both of us are dead because it’s so much fun to talk.” Previously, Hassett led polls by a significant margin according to odds site Kalshi. However, in recent days, he has lost some of that steam and now sits at a 50% likelihood. Picking up steam is Kevin Warsh, who now sits at odds of 40% on Kalshi. Warsh has experience that spans the private sector, Capitol Hill, and senior roles within the Federal Reserve. The Stanford alumnus began his professional career at Morgan Stanley in 1995, before leaving in 2002 to serve in the administration of President George W. Bush. Bush then nominated Warsh to the Fed’s Board of Governors in 2006. During this term, the Harvard alumnus served as the Board’s representative to the Group of Twenty (G-20) and as an emissary to the emerging and advanced economies in Asia. Warsh left the Fed in 2011 and since then has served as a board member to UPS and Coupang, as well as acting as economic advisor to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). He is also a partner at Duquesne Family Office, the family office of legendary investor Stanley Druckenmiller. Warsh is, like Hassett, dovish—but does not have the perception of being so closely linked with the White House. He made his differences with the Fed clear before his name was touted chairman. Explaining his position in a WSJ op-ed last month, Warsh argued that “AI will be a significant disinflationary force” and that “inflation is a choice, and the Fed’s track record under Chairman Jerome Powell is one of unwise choices. The Fed should re-examine its great mistakes that led to the great inflation. It should abandon the dogma that inflation is caused when the economy grows too much and workers get paid too much.” He added: “The Fed is an institution whose reach has extended far beyond its grasp. Fundamental reform of monetary and regulatory policy would unlock the benefits of AI to all Americans. The economy would be stronger. Living standards would be higher. Inflation would fall further. And the Fed will have contributed to a new golden age.” With the above in mind, Warsh wants to pull the Fed toward the “backseat” role that Treasury Secretary Bessent has recently begun lobbying for. On the sidelines of the IMF earlier this year, Warsh reportedly said: “The central bank should find new comfort in working without applause and without the audience at the edge of its seats.” Chris Waller is a familiar face to markets as he is a current member of the Fed’s board, beginning in December 2020 and ending in 2030. Governor Waller’s name began circulating as a candidate given his departure from consensus voting on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) earlier this year, advocating the more dovish route, which Trump said would be necessary to secure a nomination. Waller has also been optimistic about Trump’s policies, which may impact monetary policy, for example, saying the effect of tariffs has been “small so far.” While Waller is a distinguished academic analysts have questioned whether the White House’s attention to Waller stems largely from his dissent from the wait-and-see stance of the Fed more broadly. Back in July, when Waller and fellow Governor Michelle Bowman (also briefly seen by some as a potential chair) dissented from a decision to hold the base rate, UBS’s Paul Donovan observed: “Fed Chair Powell tried to present the two dissenting views as being rationally based, but investors are bound to suspect that the rationale amounted to little more than an excited jumping up and down and shouting ‘pick me, pick me’ in the general direction of the White House.” Waller currently has Kalshi odds of 6%. Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of Global Fixed Income at BlackRock, is an outsider also on the list of candidates. Rieder has had a successful career in the private sector, including a stint at Lehman Brothers between 1987 and 2008, as R3 Capital Partners’ CEO and President, and is now responsible for managing $2.4 trillion at BlackRock. Rieder has gained exposure to public sector bodies, having served as vice chairman of the Borrowing Committee for the U.S. Treasury and as a member of the Fed’s Investment Advisory Committee on Financial Markets. The exec’s odds aren’t great, sitting at 2%—that’s behind even Scott Bessent, who has repeatedly said he doesn’t want the job, both publicly and to President Trump himself. Of course, investors have been surprised by President Trump before, so the odds must be taken with a pinch of salt. Rieder has been saying what the Oval Office wants to hear, continually advocating for rate cuts this year and arguing the economy is approaching normalcy. Rieder hasn’t been as outspoken in his criticism of the Fed—or its leadership and past decisions—as some of the other candidates vying for the job, but has shared a bullish view on the economy, which coincides with Trump’s calls for cuts. What may have piqued the attention of Fed supporters is that Reider has previously warned analysts against viewing the Fed as a safety net, which purists will appreciate, given the argument that the Fed should focus on its mandate rather than financial markets. Back in 2020, Rieder told the Long View podcast: “I think [the Fed has] been amazingly thoughtful about how they’ve addressed these markets, and being thoughtful and innovative about how they do it. But I don’t believe in the thesis away from Treasuries and mortgages that you just follow the Fed willy-nilly, because the Fed is not trying to move prices in a certain area, certainly not in credit.” He continued: “I hear it all the time, where people say, “You know, I’m buying (for example) investment-grade credit”–which by the way, we’re buying as well but in a slightly different way. But people say, “Gosh, if the Fed is in that, they are going to make sure that market holds up well.” I’m not sure I really believe that … I think there is too much overzealousness that, gosh, I’m going to be okay as long as the Fed is there without doing the credit work. I hear it all the time.”

Title: Dame Dash FULLY Broke … They’re Auctioning Off His ‘Media Empire’!

Time Published: 2025-12-15T15:43:21Z

Damon Dash’s long, painful financial unraveling just hit another brutal chapter. Media Take Out has learned that Dash is set to watch his film catalog go up for auction in New York City on December 30, 2025, as two states line up to grab whatever money they can from his massive bankruptcy case. A federal judge has authorized the U.S. Marshals Service to auction off copyrights tied to Poppington LLC, Damon Dash’s media company. That means films like Honor Up, Too Honorable, and Welcome to Blackrock are officially headed to the chopping block. The order comes after years of legal drama, unpaid judgments, and mounting debt that finally caught up with the Roc-A-Fella cofounder. The auction will start with a minimum bid of $300,000, though the final price could climb depending on interest. One of the most notable titles is Honor Up, which was executive produced by Kanye West and starred Dash himself alongside Cam’ron and Stacy Dash. Once seen as a passion project, the film is now just another asset being liquidated. Dash filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in September, listing more than $25 million in liabilities and a jaw dropping $4,350 in assets. His debts include roughly $19 million in unpaid taxes, nearly $400,000 in back child and spousal support, and multiple civil judgments that have followed him for more than a decade. While bankruptcy is usually meant to pause collections, the court ruled that assets already seized by the Marshals were fair game. That cleared the way for the auction to move forward. Both New York and New Jersey are now aggressively trying to collect. New Jersey filed a secured claim for nearly $4 million, backed by a statutory lien on all of Dash’s property and earning over 10 percent interest. New York came in even harder, filing a claim for more than $8.6 million in unpaid income taxes. Both states positioned themselves early so they can get paid first from whatever money the auction brings in. Creditors like filmmaker Josh Webber also hold serious leverage. They can submit a “credit bid,” meaning they could claim the film rights in exchange for the money Dash already owes them. If that happens, other creditors could be left with nothing. Webber already scored big once before. Back in November 2024, Dash lost his one third stake in Roc-A-Fella Records after failing to pay an $823,000 judgment to Webber over the film Dear Frank. That auction ended with a $1 million winning bid from a representative of New York State, which used the purchase to chip away at Dash’s massive tax bill. Once hailed as one of hip hop’s sharpest business minds, Damon Dash is now watching his legacy assets get sold piece by piece to satisfy debts. And with two states and multiple creditors circling, December 30 could mark one of the final dismantlings of what used to be a hip hop empire. Tags ·Dame Dash

The private fund, dubbed My OnChain Net Yield Fund, or “MONY,” will be seeded with $100 million of the bank’s capital before it can be accessed on Tuesday by individuals with at least $5 million in assets or institutions with $25 million or more, the bank said. MONY, which requires an investment of at least $1 million, represents JPMorgan’s continued experimentation with digital assets, following the debut of its Kinexys Digital Assets platform a year ago. JPMorgan said its MONY fund is available on its Morgan Money platform. The bank said investors are able to earn a yield while holding the fund’s associated token on-chain, mirroring the functionality of BlackRock’s “BUIDL” fund. When BlackRock debuted its $1.8 billion fund last March, the Wall Street heavyweight also tapped Ethereum. JPMorgan said that the debut of its MONY fund underscores “the industry’s growing shift toward tokenization of assets on public networks,” noting that money-market funds have historically provided investors with liquidity and stability, in addition to yield. In a statement, John Donohue, head of global liquidity at JPMorgan Asset Management, said that the bank expects other Globally Systemically Important Banks (or G-SIBs) “to follow our lead in providing clients with greater optionality in how they invest in money market funds.” BlackRock’s BUIDL fund is available on eight different networks, including Solana, according to data provider RWA.xyz. The fund’s ability to operate across multiple blockchains is enabled by tokenization specialist Securitize and interoperability protocol Wormhole. Franklin Templeton debuted the first mutual fund on-chain in 2021, which is called the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund. In addition to Ethereum and some layer-2 scaling networks, Franklin Templeton’s fund is available on Avalanche, Stellar, and Aptos. JPMorgan has made a series of announcements with regards to an expanding line on crypto-focused products in recent weeks. Last month, it proposed structured notes tied to Bitcoin’s price, while reportedly debuting a deposit token on Coinbase’s Base. Although the bank’s latest was aimed at Ethereum’s ecosystem, the JPMorgan recent activity suggests a multi-chain approach. For example, the bank recently arranged the issuance of commercial paper on Solana on behalf of institutional crypto firm Galaxy Digital.

Title: Most Influential: Pavel Durov
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2025/12/15/most-influential-pavel-durov
Time Published: 2025-12-15T15:00:00Z
Full Content:
As CEO of billion-user messaging app Telegram, Pavel Durov may stand as the most pivotal figure in bona fide mass adoption of cryptocurrency for many observers. This feature is a part of CoinDesk's Most Influential 2025 list. By embedding the wallet for the TON blockchain into its popular messaging app, Telegram aims to remove some of the most cumbersome elements of interacting with crypto, such as remembering seed phrases and registering on an exchange. In short, Durov wants to make Telegram the biggest mass-market crypto on-ramp, offering digital asset services through an interface that's as simple as sending a message. In 2025, Telegram garnered attention from no less a prospective investor than the world's largest asset manager, BlackRock. Telegram raised $1.7 billion via convertible bonds in a tender offer, which closed in late May, that drew the interest of investors including BlackRock, Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth fund Mubadala and hedge fund Citadel. Durov is known as a staunch advocate of privacy and free speech, which formed part of his motivation for the creation of Telegram in 2014. However, his reputation sometimes precedes him when it comes to law enforcement agencies. In August of 2024, French authorities confiscated his passport and imposed a travel ban on him following preliminary charges related to complicity in drug trafficking, money laundering and fraud through Telegram. When he recovered his passport in March this year, the TON token jumped 20% on the news. While Durov and Telegram, in general, may remain controversial, according to some observers, 2025 also saw the app demonstrate a determination to crack down on unlawful use of its platform, which would otherwise tarnish it with the brush of crime, fraud, and so on. This year, Telegram shut down illicit crypto-centric marketplaces Xinbi and Haowang, formerly Huione, in partnership with blockchain sleuths Elliptic. The two marketplaces were thought to have processed transactions worth over $40 billion combined on Telegram since 2021.

The number of deaths on Irish roads so far this year has passed the total figure for 2024, according to provisional data from An Garda Síochána. There have been 180 road deaths to date as of Monday, 16 more compared with the same period last year. The fatalities include 70 drivers, 30 motorcyclists, 42 pedestrians, 20 passengers, 14 cyclists, two e-scooter drivers or passengers and a pillion passenger. There were 174 road deaths in 2024, including 72 drivers, 17 motorcyclists, 35 passengers, 33 pedestrians, 12 cyclists and three e-scooter drivers or passengers. There has been a 76 per cent increase to date in the number of motorcyclist deaths compared to last year. Three people died in two road crashes in Co Tipperary over the weekend, while a woman driver, aged in her 70s, also died over recent days after she was hospitalised following a single-car crash in Co Kerry last Wednesday. Susan Gray, founder of the Parc road safety and victim support group, said the annual increase in road deaths was “very worrying”. “We’re into the most dangerous time of the year, the festive period. People are being reminded but still the figures are going up and a lot of them are young people,” she said. “To think that families are preparing for Christmas and may even have presents under the tree, will now be visiting their loved ones at graves. I can’t get that out of my head. It’s just heartbreaking and there is just so much more that could be done by the Government and the Road Safety Authority [RSA].” [ PR campaigns are not enough to stop people dying on our roads. Here is what we need to doOpens in new window ] Ms Gray’s husband Steve died after being knocked down by an unaccompanied learner driver on St Stephen’s Day 2004 in Inishowen, Co Donegal. The RSA said the rise in road fatalities underscores the “urgent need” for continued vigilance and collective action. The State agency said it remains “unwavering” in its commitment and efforts to prevent crashes, improve road safety and promote behaviours and measures that can save lives on roads. Seán Canney, Minister of State at the Department of Transport with responsibility for road transport, said he was “devastated that the numbers are so high this year”. “It is important we take stock of what we’re doing individually on the roads and what we’re doing in terms of providing safety, enforcement. We will renew all our efforts to make the roads safer,” he told The Irish Times. Mr Canney also said he had confidence in the RSA but that there was “more to do” around “messaging to people”. [ Concerning rise in Irish road deaths and lack of impactful responseOpens in new window ] An Garda Síochána is conducting an enforcement operation on the roads throughout the Christmas period, which began on December 1st and will continue until January 5th, 2026. Last week, 147 people were arrested for driving under the influence of either alcohol or drugs, with more than 3,265 drivers detected for speeding offences. A driver was found to be travelling 101km/h in a 50km/h zone on Newtownpark Avenue in Blackrock, south Co Dublin. Another motorist was discovered driving 118km/h in a 60km/h zone in Stranorlar, Co Donegal, with a separate driver travelling 201km/h in a 120km/h region in Kinvara, Co Galway. More than 600 vehicles were seized by gardaí for a range of offences under the Road Traffic Act 1961. About 330 fixed-charge notices were issued for using a mobile phone while driving and 85 fines handed out for failing to wear a seat belt. An Garda Síochána said the Christmas period was one of the busiest on Irish roads and when road users are at the highest risk of being involved in a fatal or serious crash. “Members of An Garda Síochána are out day and night across the country as part of our enforcement campaign and will intercept drivers who are putting their lives and the lives of others at risk,” it said. The Department of Transport said 2025 has been a “very difficult year” on Irish roads. It said road safety remains a “core priority” for the Government, with Budget 2026 providing €1.72 billion for “national, regional and local roads, alongside safety-focused measures”.

Title: Venezuela is where Trump aims to annihilate our adversaries
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/12/15/opinion/venezuela-is-where-trump-aims-to-annihilate-our-adversaries/
Time Published: 2025-12-15T14:00:09Z
Full Content:
Venezuela is swiftly becoming ground zero of President Trump’s America First reshaping of US foreign policy. The United States seized the oil tanker Skipper off the country’s coast Wednesday, capping off months of heightened tensions. The sanctioned vessel has carried crude for Iran and had an estimated 1.1 million barrels on board. On the surface, the pressure’s been over ridding Caracas of illegitimate President Nicolás Maduro. Ditto ending government-sponsored narco-terrorists using Venezuela as a transit hub and safe haven to smuggle Colombian cocaine and other illicit drugs to North America and the Caribbean. But confronting Maduro is far more about Team Trump reasserting US dominance in the Western Hemisphere. Trump’s intended recipients? Beijing, Tehran and Moscow. His message? Hands off. Trump signaled his reassertion of the Monroe Doctrine was coming just days before taking office in January. While the mainstream media obsessed about his comments about Greenland and the Panama Canal, they missed his point. He was warning about China’s short- and long-term intentions to create economic and military strangleholds on the Americas. This includes President Xi Jinping’s designs to dominate the Northern Sea Route by declaring China a “Near-Arctic State” in 2018. Nominally, the declaration was about “developing shipping, carrying out scientific research and exploiting the region’s oil, gas, minerals, fisheries and other resources,” as the Wall Street Journal reported. But it’s really about Beijing boxing the United States out of the Arctic, especially as its sea lanes open up due to polar warming. Hence Trump’s emphasis on the importance of Greenland in defending the NSR and his welcomed October announcement that the Coast Guard is purchasing 11 new icebreakers. Xi is playing the same strategic game in the Panama Canal. Chinese companies control the key Pacific and Atlantic ports of Balboa and Cristóbal. Under the Trump administration’s aegis, a memorandum of understanding was signed in March for US-based BlackRock to acquire the ports. Beijing, however, has delayed the closing, citing national security interests. And at the end of the world in South America, Xi is seeking to acquire port facilities in Punta Arenas, Chile, to dominate the Drake Passage. Team Trump essentially seeks to end any great-power competition in the Americas — particularly China’s efforts to militarily dominate sea passages in the Arctic, Panama Canal Zone and Antarctica. Given the National Security Strategy’s proclamation of the “Trump Corollary” to the Monroe Doctrine, we now know how America intends to check and eventually end Chinese, Russian and Iranian malevolent activities in the Western Hemisphere. It aims to preserve freedom of navigation in the Americas; eject crippling Chinese Belt and Road Initiative investment in Latin America and the Caribbean and replace it with American capital; and marginalize malign actors such as Maduro in Venezuela while rewarding US allies. It’s a heavy lift. Through 2024, cumulative direct Chinese foreign investment in Latin America and the Caribbean stood at $8.53 billion, per Enrique Dussel Peters at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. China’s Development Bank and its Export-Import Bank had lent the regions more than $120 billion as of 2023. Notably, Venezuela tops that list at $59.2 billion. Brazil — a founding member of Beijing-dominated BRICS — is next at $32.4 billion, with Jamaica the largest Caribbean recipient of Chinese bank loans at $1.6 billion. Significantly, Jamaica is a major “hot spot” of trafficking illicit drugs from Venezuela to the United States, Mexico and Canada, per the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. Team Trump views confronting Venezuela as the best means of countering growing Chinese influence in the Americas. Caracas is Beijing’s crown jewel in South America. Eighty percent of Venezuelan oil exports “went directly and indirectly to China through little-known intermediaries,” Reuters reports. That’s code for shadow oil fleets. Such as Skipper, the oil tanker seized falsely flying Guyana’s flag. The United States sanctioned the vessel in 2022 for transporting oil for Iran to support Hezbollah militants in Lebanon and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ Quds Force. Iran is undeterred and doubling down on defying Trump in Venezuela. Petroleos de Venezuela and the National Iranian Oil Refining and Distribution Company signed a deal to improve fuel output at the Paraguaná Refining Center to end Caracas’ “reliance on US refinery technology,” Reuters reports. Russia lurks in Venezuela as well. President Vladimir Putin — hypocritically, given his complaints of NATO aid to Ukraine in his backyard — has supplied the country with military aid, training and investment since the days of Hugo Chávez in the early 2000s. The two countries signed a 10-year Treaty on Strategic Partnership and Cooperation in October. Putin reaffirmed his support for Maduro in a telephone call Thursday. The Kremlin is not ready to capitulate to Trump in Venezuela. Nor is Maduro, who appears to believe he can outlast Trump despite the largest buildup of US forces in the Caribbean since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis and new Trump administration sanctions on him, his family and business cronies. Maduro’s obstinance could cause the standoff with Washington to become kinetic. US military strikes on Venezuelan ports, army bases and airports used in staging and trafficking illicit drugs may be in the making. Trump’s newly enshrined Trump Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine hangs in the balance. It’s unlikely the president will stand down. Maduro is overestimating his position and underestimating Trump’s resolve. María Corina Machado, who escaped Venezuela last week to accept her Nobel Peace Prize, stands at the ready to succeed the corrupt Maduro as president. The question is: When do US demonstrations translate into action? Trump cannot allow Maduro to stand in the way of Washington re-establishing strategic security in the Americas. Venezuela is the necessary first step. Diminishing Beijing, Tehran and Moscow throughout the hemisphere is the worthy goal. Mark Toth writes on national security and foreign policy. Col. (Ret.)

Title: JPMorgan expands blockchain push with tokenized money-market fund on Ethereum

JPMorgan Chase is preparing to deepen its push into blockchain-based finance through a tokenized money-market fund on Ethereum, according to a Wall Street Journal report published on Monday. The bank has not formally announced the product, but the report suggests JPMorgan is moving closer to offering onchain versions of traditional cash-management tools as institutional interest in tokenization grows. The reported initiative comes as large investors look for ways to deploy idle cash more efficiently while maintaining regulatory compliance. With about $4 trillion in assets under management, JPMorgan’s reported plans highlight how tokenization is evolving from experimental pilots into investment products associated with major global balance sheets. The proposed fund would enter a fast-growing segment of digital finance where money-market products are increasingly viewed as a bridge between traditional markets and blockchain infrastructure. The fund, known as My OnChain Net Yield Fund, or MONY, has been seeded with $100 million from JPMorgan’s asset management division, the Wall Street Journal stated. The product is expected to open to external, qualified investors this week, although no official confirmation has been issued by the bank. The minimum investment is set at $1 million, keeping the fund focused on institutional participation rather than retail investors. MONY is designed to operate in line with conventional money-market funds, holding short-term debt instruments and paying interest on a daily basis. Investors would be able to redeem their shares either in cash or through Circle’s USDC stablecoin, reflecting the growing use of regulated stablecoins in institutional settlement and liquidity management. JPMorgan has built the reported fund on Kinexys Digital Assets, its in-house tokenization platform, with Ethereum selected as the underlying blockchain, according to the Wall Street Journal. Tokenized funds record ownership onchain, allowing faster settlement, real-time visibility, and continuous trading beyond standard market hours. These features are attracting attention from asset managers, trading firms, and treasury desks seeking operational efficiency while continuing to rely on low-risk instruments. Tokenized money-market funds are also increasingly used within decentralised finance ecosystems as reserve assets and as collateral for trading and asset management. JPMorgan’s reported plans place it alongside other large financial institutions that have already launched tokenized money-market products. Franklin Templeton introduced its BENJI fund in 2021, becoming one of the earliest traditional asset managers to adopt blockchain-based fund infrastructure. BlackRock followed in 2024 with its BUIDL fund, developed with tokenization specialist Securitize, which has since attracted about $2 billion in assets, according to data from RWA.xyz.

Title: JPMorgan just crossed a dangerous line with Solana that major banks have strictly avoided until now

JPMorgan issued $50 million in commercial paper on Solana with USDC settlement, but most institutional tokenization remains proof-of-concept scale without displacing traditional workflows. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. JPMorgan recently issued $50 million in US commercial paper for Galaxy Digital on Solana, with Coinbase and Franklin Templeton as buyers. The bank created an on-chain USCP token, settling both issuance and redemption cash flows in USDC rather than bank wires. Both issuance and servicing of the deal ran entirely on blockchain rails. As a template, JPMorgan intends to extend to more issuers, investors, and security types in 2026. The announcement follows a pattern. Institutional on-chain issuance headlines recur every few months, such as Siemens' €300 million digital bond, Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon's tokenized money market funds, and BlackRock's BUIDL crossing $2.85 billion for the first time. Each is presented as a breakthrough. The challenge is separating structural progress from proof-of-concept theater. The value is in tracing what actually happened: asset type, settlement finality, counterparties, permissions, and whether the design choices change future issuance behavior or remain confined to one-off pilots. JPMorgan has run tokenized debt experiments before, but on private infrastructure. In April 2024, the bank facilitated a municipal securities offering for the City of Quincy on its permissioned platform. It issued commercial paper for OCBC on its proprietary distributed ledger. The Solana trade is not the first tokenized debt deal, but it is the first time JPMorgan's stack crosses into a public chain with real-world corporate paper, a brand-name issuer, and buyers who also operate in the crypto ecosystem. The shift from permissioned to public infrastructure matters because it changes who can participate and how assets move. Permissioned platforms limit access to pre-approved entities and keep settlement inside a controlled environment. Public chains expose tokenized assets to broader liquidity, composability with other on-chain instruments, and integration into crypto-native collateral and lending protocols. The JPMorgan deal deliberately crosses that line, settling in USDC on Solana rather than in bank deposits on a private ledger. R3's partnership with the Solana Foundation reinforces the trend. R3's Corda platform already supports roughly $10 billion in tokenized assets for clients, including Euroclear, HSBC, and Bank of America. Integrating Solana as a public chain option for tokenized shares and funds signals that institutions are treating public blockchains as production infrastructure, not just sandbox environments. Tokenized Treasury and money market funds reached approximately $7.4 billion by July 2025, up roughly 80% year-to-date, driven by BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, and Janus Henderson's Anemoy products. These tokens increasingly function as collateral in crypto derivatives and lending, not just as yield-bearing cash parking. Data from rwa.xyz shows tokenized Treasuries surpassed $9 billion in 2025, with BlackRock's BUIDL alone reaching $1 billion in total value locked mid-year and growing to approximately $2.85 billion by October. Additionally, Circle's USYC recently surpassed $1 billion in assets, fueled by its partnership with Binance to use tokenized fund shares as collateral for trading. Most of that growth sits in funds and collateral tokens that live inside walled gardens. BUIDL is limited to qualified institutions and is mainly used as collateral on institutional or large crypto venues. Franklin's BENJI fund is registered under the 1940 Act and allows investors to fund with USDC, but the fund's shares remain constrained by mutual-fund rules. Goldman and BNY Mellon's tokenized MMF work allows institutions to subscribe and redeem via tokenized rails, while keeping the official record and most settlement in traditional infrastructure. The JPMorgan/Galaxy commercial paper deal sits at a different intersection: a mainstream corporate borrower issuing on a public chain, settling into a crypto-native dollar instrument, with investors spanning both traditional finance and digital-asset platforms. That combination is rare enough to warrant scrutiny. Reading tokenized issuance announcements requires a repeatable evaluation framework. Five questions reveal whether a deal changes market structure or remains a one-off experiment. First, what is the asset? Is the blockchain token the legal security itself, or just a representation? Siemens' €300 million bond is issued natively as a digital security with no paper certificate. The JPMorgan/Galaxy commercial paper is conventional CP from a legal standpoint, but with its lifecycle events of issuance, servicing, and eventual redemption mirrored on Solana through the USCP token. The distinction determines whether the blockchain record is authoritative or auxiliary. Second, how does the cash leg settle, and where is finality? Most of the experiments in 2024 and 2025 settle either in central bank money on a permissioned ledger or in fiat via traditional rails. The JPMorgan/Solana deal is one of the first in which issuance and redemption settle into a crypto-native dollar instrument (USDC) on a public chain for a mainstream corporate borrower. That creates settlement finality on-chain rather than relying on off-chain payment confirmation. Third, who is allowed to hold and move the asset? The $7.4 billion in tokenized Treasury and MMF products is held by professional or crypto-savvy investors, with limited mainstream distribution. BUIDL is restricted to qualified institutions. Franklin's BENJI fund is a 1940 Act-registered fund, but mutual fund rules still constrain it. The permission structure determines whether the token can flow freely or remains gated by investor accreditation, KYC, or platform restrictions. Fourth, can the token be reused as collateral, and does DLT solve a real pain point? JPMorgan's Tokenized Collateral Network has demonstrated the use of tokenized money market fund shares as on-chain collateral, with benefits including near-instant repo settlement, atomic delivery-versus-payment, and improved collateral mobilization across fragmented silos. IOSCO's 2025 tokenization report notes that only a small number of tokenized MMFs have been used as collateral for crypto transactions to date, specifically citing BUIDL as one example. The question is whether the token unlocks new collateral velocity or replicates existing workflows on a different infrastructure. Fifth, does the deal connect to enabling policy changes, or does it rely on regulatory forbearance? In late 2025, the OCC issued Interpretive Letter 1188, confirming that national banks may engage in “riskless principal” crypto transactions as part of their banking business. Interpretive Letter 1186 clarified that banks can hold native tokens such as ETH or SOL on their balance sheets to pay network fees and test blockchain platforms. In January 2025, the SEC rescinded Staff Accounting Bulletin 121, which had forced banks to treat custodied crypto as a balance-sheet liability. That regulatory combination makes it plausible that a major bank uses public chains and tokenized MMFs or Treasuries as collateral and settlement assets in production, rather than confining experiments to permissioned environments. The JPMorgan/Galaxy commercial paper scores as follows: the asset is conventional CP with on-chain lifecycle mirroring, not a native digital security. Settlement finality in USDC on Solana removes reliance on bank wires but introduces a dependency on the stablecoin issuer. Counterparties include Galaxy Digital as issuer and Coinbase and Franklin Templeton as buyers, all entities with both traditional finance and crypto infrastructure. The token's permission structure is unclear from public reporting. Whether it is freely transferable on Solana or restricted to authorized holders determines whether it can flow into broader DeFi protocols or remains a closed loop. The deal's collateral reuse potential depends on whether the USCP token can be posted as margin or used in on-chain lending. JPMorgan's existing Tokenized Collateral Network suggests the bank is building toward that capability, but the Solana CP issuance does not yet demonstrate it. The policy backdrop is supportive: OCC guidance now permits banks to intermediate crypto transactions and hold gas tokens, and the SEC's SAB 121 rescission removes a custody accounting barrier. That makes the Solana deal less of a regulatory stretch than it would have been in 2024. The recurring headlines about institutional tokenization create a pattern-recognition problem. Each announcement is framed as transformative, but most remain confined to proof-of-concept scale, permissioned platforms, or asset classes that already have deep traditional infrastructure. The JPMorgan/Solana deal crosses into public chain territory with a recognizable corporate issuer and USDC settlement, but the commercial paper market is already highly liquid and efficient. The question is not whether tokenization is technically feasible, but whether it changes issuance behavior. The 2026 test is whether tokenized debt and cash instruments start displacing traditional workflows at scale. That requires four conditions: regulatory clarity on custody and settlement finality, interoperability standards that allow tokens to move across platforms without fragmentation. Additionally, it needs sufficient liquidity in on-chain venues to compete with traditional order books, and a demonstrated collateral-velocity advantage that justifies the operational overhead of running dual infrastructure. The OCC and SEC moves in 2025 address the first condition. R3's Solana integration and JPMorgan's public-chain expansion suggest progress on the second. The third and fourth remain open questions. Tokenized Treasuries at nearly $9 billion represent a rounding error in the $28 trillion Treasury market. BUIDL's $1.8 billion is meaningful in crypto terms but negligible in global money markets. The tokenized instruments need to prove they are not just another wrapper product, but a genuinely superior collateral and settlement stack. JPMorgan's explicit intention to extend the Solana template to more issuers, investors, and security types in 2026 suggests the bank views the deal as infrastructure building, not PR. Whether that proves accurate depends on adoption beyond the initial cohort of crypto-native investors and whether the tokens can be reused as collateral in production lending and derivatives markets. The framework outlined above provides a way to evaluate each subsequent announcement against those criteria, separating structural progress from one-off experiments that generate headlines but do not change market behavior.

JPMorgan Chase, a global bank with $4 trillion of assets under management, is rolling out a tokenized money-market fund on Ethereum, pushing deeper into blockchain-based finance amid growing demand from institutional clients. The move marks JPMorgan’s first tokenized money market fund, making it the largest GSIB, or Global Systemically Important Banks, to launch such a vehicle on a public blockchain, according to a press release shared with CoinDesk. The fund, dubbed My OnChain Net Yield Fund (MONY), is seeded with $100 million from the bank’s asset management division and is set to open to external, qualified investors this week, the Wall Street Journal reported first. The global bank joins a wave of high-profile financial giants launching tokenized funds on blockchain, with money-market funds leading the charge. Franklin Templeton was among the first traditional finance firms with its BENJI fund in 2021. Then, BlackRock started its BUIDL fund in 2024 with tokenization specialist Securitize, attracting $2 billion in assets to date, per RWA.xyz data. These vehicles allow investors to park idle cash on blockchains to earn a yield — like with a money market fund but with faster settlement times, around-the-clock trading and real-time visibility into ownership.

Title: How the Pandemic Accelerated the Geopolitical Breakdown

Things like mortality rising higher than births in some parts of the country, antibiotic resistance creeping up, disability claims rising, sickness absence climbing… — tern (@1goodtern) December 9, 2025 This recent post on the Twitter/X, which if true, might lead one to believe that such pandemic panic contributes to the geoeconomic panic infecting the world today. Seeing as there has been an acceleration in the geopolitical and geoeconomic breakdown in recent years, largely emanating from the world’s heart of neoliberal capitalism in the US, as well as its (also neoliberal capitalist) vassals and proxies, how much of a role did/does the pandemic play? While that might be impossible to quantify, if we subscribe to the theory that bellicosity derives, at least in part, from crises of capitalism, then if COVID-19 is causing or is contributing to crises of capitalism, then there is likely to be a connection. Evidence of COVID-19 Contribution to Crises of Capitalism Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic the US-led “West” was already in the midst of a capitalism crisis. Source: Michael Roberts’ Blog. COVID has only served to deepen it. A November brief from npj Primary Care Respiratory Medicine highlights the following: …microeconomic impacts, which are estimated at an average annual burden of $1 trillion globally and $9000 per patient in the USA, with some individuals covering substantial out-of-pocket expenses. Annual lost earnings in the USA alone are estimated at approximately $170 billion. Long COVID was associated with increased unemployment, financial distress, and work impairment for up to three years post-infection. Multiple other studies in the past year show how the pandemic has hammered productivity. See here, here, here. Additionally, the pandemic might have deepened what is described as a birth rate crisis in advanced economies. While declining birth rates can have ecological benefits, they cause alarm among the capitalist class due to negative effects on economic growth. While many of these economic trends were already present before the pandemic, COVID-19 accelerated them—or at least accelerated the fear of them. Similarly, while many of the billionaires now driving the US policies in response to these crises were already psychopaths, COVID further broke their brains—if not the virus itself then fear of what it meant for their power. Evidence that Increased Belligerence Is Result of Crises of Capitalism, Which Are Worsened by COVID-19 If one subscribes to the view that capitalist expansion (i.e., the neverending need for growth) will eventually lead to attempts at empire building in order to facilitate such expansion, then the argument is that the US-led “West” needs to do something to kickstart another growth and profitability wave. From economist Michael Roberts: This ‘golden era’ came to an end in the 1970s, when the profitability of capital fell sharply (according to Marx’s law) and the major economies suffered the first simultaneous slump in 1974-75, followed in 1980-2 with a deep manufacturing slump. Keynesian economics was exposed as a failure and economics returned to the neoclassical idea of free markets, free flow of trade and capital, deregulation of state interference and ownership of industry and finance, and the crushing of labour organisations. Profitability was (modestly) restored in the major economies and globalisation became the mantra; in effect the expansion of imperialist exploitation of the periphery under the guise of international trade and capital flows. But again, Marx’s law of profitability exerted its gravitational pull and from the turn of the millennium, the major economies experienced a fall in the profitability of their productive sectors. Only a credit-fuelled boom in finance, real estate and other unproductive sectors disguised that underlying crisis of profitability for a while (the blue line below shows the profitability of US productive sectors and the red line, the overall profitability). Source: BEA NIPA tables, author calculation But eventually this culminated in the global financial collapse, the Euro debt crisis and the Long Depression; further enhanced by the impact of the pandemic slump of 2020. European capital has been left in tatters. And US hegemony now faced a new economic rival, China, after its stupendous rise in manufacturing, trade, and more recently technology, unaffected by economic crises in the West. This is arguably what we are seeing playing out in conflicts across the globe today as the US uses its empire in an attempt to open up new markets. Why is the US trying regime change in Venezuela? Trump said back in 2023 that it’s about the oil. And here’s the current Director of National Intelligence back in 2019: Oil lobbyists have “unprecedented access” to Trump’s administration—meanwhile Pence/Bolton continue their crusade for regime change in Venezuela, the world’s richest oil reserves. The height of swamp politics. #PeopleBeforeProfits #ServiceBeforeSelf https://t.co/jlbip5u8tV — Tulsi Gabbard 🌺 (@TulsiGabbard) April 4, 2019 And it’s not just oil. Nobel Peace Prize winner María Corina Machado who argues for the bombing of her home country recently told the Miami Business Forum the following: “For the U.S., we will turn this criminal hub into a security shield in the heart of the Americas. We will open Venezuela for foreign investment, I am talking about a 1.7 trillion dollar opportunity, not only in oil and gas, … but also in mining, in gold, in infrastructure, power. We will open markets, we will have security for foreign investment, and a massive privatization program that is waiting for you”. Why does the US and its European vassals want to dismantle the Russian Federation? A major driver has always been to relive the heyday 1990s when the US’ best and brightest sucked hundreds of billions of dollars out of the country with devastating results (the number of Russians living in poverty jumped from two million to sixty million in just a few years and life expectancy plummeted among other catastrophes). There are, of course, other reasons, but those too have to do with crises of capitalism wrapped up in the pandemic. At the time Project Ukraine became a war, the EU had been in a prolonged (largely self-inflicted) economic crisis for years. The bloc’s emergency 750 billion euro COVID recovery program was supposed to stitch the union back up again, but it has underwhelmed, and instead much of the bloc elite have turned to war in a desperate bid for economic growth and to keep the union train on the tracks. That is summarized here by Wolfgang Streeck: A possible solution for the coming fiscal crisis of an EU warfare state might be member states allowing the Union to issue its own debt—which would, however, also require changes in the Treaties. It is fair to assume that von der Leyen’s out-of-thin-air fiscal commitments in the context of the Ukrainian war were, and are, aimed exactly at getting member states to grant the EU this right to incur debt, constitutive for a modern state. Indeed, that right has long been demanded by advocates of European supranational centralization and integration. An EU borrowing capacity would give member states access, outside of national state budgets and therefore invisible to national voters, to the favorite medicine of underfunded capitalist states, public debt. Keeping national contributions to the European Union low by allowing the Union to debt-finance part of its expenses would amount to another, more advanced, form of political level-shifting. Fascist Solutions in Silicon Valley Back in the US, during the early days of COVID the seeds were planted for the new imperial strategy we’re seeing today. Marc Andreessen, the billionaire who co-founded the venture capital firm a16z and, before that, played a role in the invention of the modern web browser, was a driving force behind the elite Signal group chats that began to look for solutions to their problems back in 2020. According to Semafor, those chats included other billionaires and members of companies that now play dominant roles in America’s efforts to remake the country and the world into technomonarchies. The chats were filled with billionaire grievances—that they were being underappreciated and shackled—and conviction that they knew the best way forward for humanity. As Semafor notes, “The Group Chat Era depended on part of the American elite feeling shut out from public spaces, and on the formation of a new [Silicon Valley] conservative consensus.”1 They were reportedly most concerned with “power.” That makes sense if you subscribe to the teachings of monarchist pundit Curtis Yarvin who was reportedly lionized in the Andreessen-led Signal chats. Here’s Quinn Slobodian on Yarvin’s vision for the future: Right-wing accelerationists imagine existing sovereignty shattering into what Yarvin, writing under the pen name Mencius Moldbug, calls a “patchwork” of private entities, ideally governed by what one might call technomonarchies. Existing autocratic polities like Dubai serve as rough prototypes for how nations could be dismantled into “a global spiderweb of tens, even hundreds, of thousands of sovereign and independent mini-countries, each governed by its own joint-stock corporation without regard to the residents’ opinions.” These would be decentralized archipelagoes: fortified nodes in a circuitry still linked by finance, trade, and communication. Think of the year 1000 in Middle Europe but with vertical take-off and landing taxis and Starlink internet. Yarvin expressed the essence of the worldview recently when he enthused over Trump’s proposal to ethnically cleanse the Gaza Strip and rebuild it as a US-backed colony securitized as an asset and sold to investors—as he called it, “the first charter city backed by US legitimacy: Gaza, Inc. Stock symbol: GAZA.” We are now seeing ongoing attempts to create this vision—whether in Gaza, guarding the billionaire pet project in Honduras, “Freedom Cities” in the US, the embrace of the UAE in yet another genocide, or in the deepening of an American political economic system which guarantees profits for the monopolistic weapons and tech surveillance sectors through endless war at home and abroad. Again much of these symptoms were already present in the US, but why did the pandemic produce this concerted effort from the Silicon Valley and other billionaires to double down? They were, after all, already billionaires who already control much of what passes as social planning in the US. These chats took place even before their arch nemesis Lina Khan began modest efforts at the Federal Trade Commission to rein in Silicon Valley and other billionaire rapaciousness. What were they so fearful of? What was evident to us all back when the powers that be still cared about the pandemic was presumably also evident to them. They saw the US struggling with shortages, unable to even produce personal protective equipment, and it scared them. It drove home the point that the US global position was weakening. Now, the lords of Silicon Valley and finance might be chiefly responsible for that development, but in their telling it’s because they haven’t been given enough power. One only needs to take a look at Andreessen’s April 2020 screed titled “It’s Time to Build”, which became something of a rallying cry for the technomonarchists, for a glimpse into this mindset. Whether they really believe it or it’s just opportunistic power-grabbing matters little; what does is that so far they have been successful, which is bad news for everyone, including them. The second obvious factor would likely be the growth crisis mentioned above and how COVID had the potential to make it worse. They were also horrified by what they saw as power shifting to the peasants via more generous, albeit temporary, safety net benefits and work-from-home policies. Tim Gurner might be Australian, but I believe he provided one of the more candid omissions of the billionaires’ views in this clip: Gurner Group founder Tim Gurner tells the Financial Review Property Summit workers have become “arrogant” since COVID and “We’ve got to kill that attitude.” https://t.co/lcX3CCxGuj pic.twitter.com/f9HK2YZRRE — Financial Review (@FinancialReview) September 12, 2023 Of course, these billionaire fears played the major role in the “return to normalcy” (for the peasants) push. But Andreessen and friends didn’t stop pushing there. They are part of a larger plan. Edward Ongweso Jr. looks past all the bubble talk at how AI is integral to the US plan of securing hegemonic primacy in the 21st century—regardless of whether the bubble bursts or not. The whole piece is well worth a read, but here a few key pieces: …“the final act of a three-act play” of US imperial management, featuring an evolution from “dollar diplomacy” to “oil diplomacy” to “compute diplomacy” centered around deploying our state apparatus and capital to preserve global hegemony… …the United States could manufacture a “sovereignty crisis” with some hysteria about compromised datacenters and Chinese chips—the only cure, then, is the American option: US-made chips (Nvidia), US-controlled cloud architecture (Microsoft/Amazon), US-controlled financing (BlackRock, Emirati investment firm MGX), and so on. …What political vehicle will meet the task for building this new order? One candidate is the burgeoning coalition that we can describe as the Compute Axis: 1) Silicon Valley and its capital-intensive dream of building God out of sand; 2) Trump and his brigands—concerned with transactional relationships, deregulation, and imperial plunder; 3) the sovereign capital of Gulf sovereigns. There’s certainly no guarantee it’ll work, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t going to try. In the meantime, what does it mean for the peasants? The tech bro takeover must continue “because China…” Picture CCP-controlled Chinese AI running the world. How does that make you feel? https://t.co/yxQZ9es5MB — Marc Andreessen 🇺🇸 (@pmarca) February 6, 2025 To “win”, America just must turn over all — as opposed to the large majority— of its capital allocation decisions to a bunch of billionaires chiefly concerned with cementing their grip on power. That’s always the common theme. In order to “build” to “win” there must be no regulations, and AI must be supported to the moon. These policies are already teed up for Democrats 2028 in the form of “abundance,” which when you really boil it down is just the flip side to same coin that is Trump’s current all-in AI approach: the technomonarchists must be given everything they need and want and they will deliver us to their idea of victory. Despite the current tech-friendly reign, Silicon Valley titans are still having a rough go of it. And the great irony is that they’re accelerating America’s demise: Isn’t one of the most obvious features of China’s success that it’s built on capacity to discipline its capitalist firms – including the “inevitable chiselers in their ranks.” Brings to mind this observation from FDR, seemingly lost to Western posterity. https://t.co/IAzOdHlbtK https://t.co/8QCfeZHE3q pic.twitter.com/U8GJ4SoOpA — Nikhil Pal Singh (@nikhil_palsingh) November 30, 2025 What the recent events from Venezuela to Gaza to the streets of the US demonstrate, however, is that unless decision-making power is taken away from the techmonarchists, the world is in for a whole lot more hurt—both at home and abroad. We likely would have gotten to this breakdown point regardless, but the COVID-19 pandemic, rather than serving as moment for reflection, cooperation, and as Andreessen put it, an opportunity to “build,” tragically became a moment of acceleration with US and Western elites doubling down on nearly all dystopian fronts. As they face more setbacks, why would the next response be any different? *** Notes Let me post a little criticism: when you say that when Covid started the west was in the midst of a productivity crisis, and then illustrate it with a profitability graph. I have lot of issues with measures of productivity in terms of money value but in any case two different concepts are productivity and profitability. This does not mean any criticism on the thesis of the article. For that I would need further thinking but something has been clear to me these years: The Ukraine war might have started sooner if there had not been an interfering pandemic. The pandemic delayed it for a while. Looks like I mixed up text and graphs there. Thanks for pointing out. Fixed. I am going to take a theme of predation today, after Michaelmas’s response to a comment that I made in comments yesterday. Predation is, in a sense rational, even if immoral. What we are witnessing is another stage of predation by humans. The expropriation of wealth isn’t something new, and what is going on now is the expropriation of wealth from the working class, poor, and, incidentally, the middle classes. Gurner isn’t a rarity — he’s vulgar capitalism in all its glory. The technological change going from software to web browsers to platforms to AI is causing a redistribution in power. People like to talk about Gutenberg, movable type, the Reformation, and power. Hannah Arendt was as skeptic of the Reformation because she considered it as an excuse to confiscate wealth: From The Human Condition, published in 1958: “For the enormous and still proceeding accumulation of wealth in modern society, which was started by expropriation— the expropriation of the peasant classes which in turn was the almost accidental consequence of the expropriation of Church and monastic property after the Reformation—has never shown much consideration for private property but has sacrificed it whenever it came into conflict with the accumulation of wealth. Proudhon’s dictum that property is theft has a solid basis of truth in the origins of modern capitalism; … ” Meanwhile, the response from much of middle-brow Anglo-America is beggar thy neighbor and cheering on the predation, much as mobs sacked the churches in the Low Countries during the Reformation. So the essay by Conor Gallagher is an excellent diagnosis. If we go by the Reformation, we are in for thirty, forty, fifty years of ideological / religious wars. The populations of parts of Europe like Alsace were reduced to mere thousands. Because the predators want to wreck the state, the state is the way out. Ironically. Yet war is the health of the state, so people like Trump, Hillary Clinton, Ursula von der Leyen are symptoms of degradation. And besides their love of war, they hate the working class and know nothing of industrial production or the traditional arts and crafts. PS: I do have a quibble, so I will quibble. I disagree with a word here: “Similarly, while many of the billionaires now driving the US policies in response to these crises were already psychopaths, COVID further broke their brains—if not the virus itself then fear of what it meant for their power.” Nope. They are not psychopaths. They are predators. They are more or less rational, even if driven by their fears. Think about MacBeth. He isn’t crazy. He and the Lady decide to murder for predation and profit. So if we simply get rid of all these immoral people problem solved? I don’t think so. And I believe the point of Macbeth is that predation makes him crazy. Power corrupts but the corruption in turn is self limiting. So here’s suggesting that all the tech futurism is merely vaporware by people in denial about their own humanity and a desire to create a kind of religion out of technology. It’s not new at all but simply the same old thing. Tuchman called it the March of Folly. So here’s suggesting that all the tech futurism is merely vaporware by people in denial about their own humanity and a desire to create a kind of religion out of technology. Add to this the expectation of immortality or at least living to 150 because of said tech futurism Or having your brain implanted in a robot ala dick cheney. To dig a little deeper into Macbeth, it’s not his desire for the wealth and power of the King that ‘makes him crazy’, but the conflict between that – largely forced on him by his wife – and his inherent sense of right and morality “Too full of the milk of human kindness,” as she says of him. Don’t forget it’s Lady Macbeth that has to finish the job and then suffers her own crisis of conscience – “Out, damn spot” – before being driven to suicide. It’s ‘the milk of human kindness’ that’s missing today. MACBETH Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck, Till thou applaud the deed. Come, seeling night, Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day, And with thy bloody and invisible hand Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond Which keeps me pale. Light thickens And the crow makes wing to the rooky wood; Good things of day begin to droop and drowse, While night’s black agents to their preys do rouse. Thou marvell’st at my words; but hold thee still. Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill. So, prithee, go with me. I shall quibble back, and posit the possibility that you have to be a psychopath in order to be okay with predating upon your own species. These techno-bros behave like the love children of characters from Atlas Shrugged and The Great Gatsby, surrogated inside sundry succubi. I fervently wish that they would just take their Ill-gotten gains and just GO. To Mars, Elysium, their island bunkers, wherever …. Ugh. I guess I’m just cranky this morning… Erm, in France was the French Revolution that confiscated church property to support the new government. Then bishop Talleyrand read out the decree and was pretty shortly excommunicated. It was returned to the church in the Restoration. So this can hardly be seen at least there as expropriation from the peasants, since the Revolution also resulted in destruction of land records and land reform. Some of the Church’s lands were returned during the Restoration. But any lands sold or auctioned off between 1789 and 1815 were lost. The buyers–mainly well-to-do peasants and bourgeois–got to keep them. Napoleon insisted that the Church agree to this as part of his Concordat (1801). Up until then the market value of those properties had been depressed because of chronic uncertainty (thanks to the political situation) over whether the Church might or might not get them back. Needless to say, this provision of the Concordat boosted the property values and made Napoleon extremely popular with the proprietaires. “mobs sacked the churches in the Low Countries during the Reformation” I don’t know about the Low Countries, but I have run across the history of iconoclasm in Wittenberg, the “birthplace” of the Reformation. Luther was on the lam, hiding out at Elector Frederick’s place, because the pope had put him under the ban. Back in Wittenberg, the leadership of the Reformation was taken up by Andreas Bodenstein von Karlstadt, Luther’s colleague at the University of Wittenberg. Karstadt, as he’s commonly called in Lutheran writings, was an enthusiastic iconoclast who took very seriously the prohibition against images in the Ten Commandments as they appear in Exodus 20. Karlstadt and his followers went about breaking windows and destroying statues with such abandon that Luther came out of hiding to put a stop to the madness. Luther’s views won out among Lutherans, and Karlstadt was forced into what became the Radical Reformation where he had plenty of company as an iconoclast. Church decoration, Luther taught, was a matter of adiophora, Greek for “indifferent things.” Accordingly, one can find Lutheran churches with empty crosses and no statues or Lutheran churches like the one my spouse grew up in with a cross with corpus behind the altar and even a statue of Mary behind the baptismal font. The reason for Karlstadt’s destruction was not the same as the fervor of Spanish anarchists’ for looting the Spanish Roman Catholic churches that had hoarded wealth for centuries even when surrounded by hungry people. The anti-clericalism of the Anarchist Revolution (or one might say anticipatory counter-revolution) in Barcelona in 1936 is brought out by the movie Libertarias. where a monseigneur is is taken out and shot summarily. As the tough female anarchist explains to a shocked new recruit, “It’s a revolution, not a fiesta.” This is all fine as a general statement of COVID-19’s exposure of what neoliberal financialization and deindustrialization have done to the ‘West’ and a piece of agitprop about Silicon Valley oligarchs’ aims. But I think Naked Capitalism had a more useful analysis by political scientist Tom Ferguson and a colleague last month — Tom Ferguson and Nick French: Red Tech’s Political Power, Its War on Labor and the Environment https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2025/11/tom-ferguson-and-nick-french-red-techs-political-power-its-war-on-labor-and-the-environment.html More useful because more specific. Ferguson and his colleague detail — based on their research and interviews — exactly why ‘Big Tech’ on one side and its political enemies on the other side currently have the positions they do, what specific parties hope to gain, what they’re doing, and then isn’t afraid to draw some conclusions. Starting with, as Yves said, that ‘Silicon Valley’s .. opposition to unions…(is) not out of the traditional desire to crush wage rates but to roll (over) all opposition to their campaign to remake society.’ And Ferguson gets specific from there. ‘A possible solution for the coming fiscal crisis of an EU warfare state might be member states allowing the Union to issue its own debt—which would, however, also require changes in the Treaties.’ That is half the story. If you are going to raise what will be hundreds of billions of dollars of debt, then you are going to need collateral. And the guys at The Duran say that this will be in the form of the EU being able to levy taxes. Maybe 1% at first – like a VAT or a GST – but then could eventually will go to five, ten or twenty percent. It could even be said that the real reason for raising all those debts is to enable EU taxation. No doubt Ursula will bring it in under an emergency decree or something dispensing with a vote of the EU member States. How will the tax be enforced? Will Ursula also create an EU police force for this? I would imagine they would set up an EU taxation office and taxes would be collected at point of sale along with any taxes that individual EU States would collect. These would be electronically be sent on to Brussels. So maybe she would also create an equivalent of the IRS as well. No-one wants to take on the IRS after all- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G56VgsLfKY4 (22 secs) Why do you think she’s so intent on building a EU “army”. She’s alot of things but dumb enough to think any military force that Europe could manage to kludge together in the next few years would stand any chance against Russia is unlikely. So why does she want it? Simple to unleash on member states if they get out of hand, if the population gets a little to riled up, starts general striking, or maybe voting the wrong way, maybe they want to leave the EU. Yes the support of an unwinnable war, militarization,raising EU debt etc, its all about the last attempt to bring about the Federal Europe dream. Given the supine ‘leaders’ of the major nations it might work, although the odds are probably on an acrimonious split of many leaving the old ‘coal and steel’ members standing. If the Euro is to persist as an international currency, this is inevitable. It should have been part of the original project, if they had been honest (beyond their capacity). If there is no democratic ascent to the taxation, it will be the last thing the Commission ever does before it is replaced by either sovereign seizure by the Council, or the EU falling apart. I’ve been wondering lately about general mal-investment gumming up the economy. In classical terms, businesses need X technology to raise productivity and pay their debts, but the big investors invest everything into Y technology instead, which turns out to be a dead end. Productivity stagnates, businesses turn into debt-ridden zombies, and the big investors start looking for another dumb idea hail-mary to recoup their losses. Work-from-home and Zoom didn’t make offices more productive, Door Dash didn’t make restaurants more profitable, streaming didn’t save Hollywood, and nothing happens on Meta. If all that money had been thrown into infrastructure, logistics, energy, agriculture, or whatever, or even just giving the old guard at the job more time to train the new hires, things would surely be better. “”As America, we now have two choices: win in AI, including win in open source AI. Or let China win in AI, all over the world. I believe it is critically important that we win. Kneecapping American AI, and American open source AI, to protect Big Proprietary AI is asking to lose.”” Frankly I would rather China won than these guys. Thanks for resurrecting the excellent passage from FDR, Connor. If anything, I think FDR was being excessively gracious by allowing good motives on the part of the wealthy elites who are trying to control society. Of course, people will always self-describe their actions as being well intentioned, but one should not take their word on this. Wealthy elites always feel a great sense of entitlement, coming from a belief that (a) great wealth is a marker for great intelligence and ability, and (b) intelligence and ability entitle one to make decisions for an entire society. Particularly in the current era (I can’t speak for earlier eras) it’s been striking how ordinary and lacking in ability members of the wealthy elite class have been. Even in the rare case where an elite excels in a narrow technical skill, they invariably lack the generalized ability to see farther than others in a broad sense and to draw the proper conclusions from what they see, which is the hallmark of intelligence. Our descent into rule-by-the-wealthy in the last few decades explains a lot of what’s been going on, I think. It’s the opposite of a meritocracy. One nit-pick with the sources cited by Conor: the expression “Long Depression” is a well-established historical term designating the profound economic crisis that raked (mainly) Europe and North America from 1873 to 1896. The “Great Depression” is of course what happened in the period 1929-1939. I have seen the term “Long Recession” used to describe the economic crisis following the great financial crash of 2008. The economic crisis of the 1970s had nothing to do with the failure of Keynesian economics – it was really all about the oil shocks. But the Keynesian thing certainly paved the toward 40+ years of accelerating neoliberalism and inequality. Your email address will not be published.

SambaNova has also engaged with other potential investors, having signed preliminary agreements with them. This acquisition could significantly enhance Intel’s AI capabilities by incorporating SambaNova’s specialised chip designs into its portfolio. In 2021, SambaNova was valued at $5bn in a funding round led by SoftBank Group’s Vision Fund 2. Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. The potential acquisition aligns with Intel’s strategy to strengthen its position in the AI sector, where customised chip solutions are increasingly important. Founded in 2017 by Stanford University professors, SambaNova concentrates on developing advanced AI chips that compete with Nvidia’s offerings. Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, who serves as chairman of SambaNova, has been integral since its inception through his venture capital firm Walden International. Walden led a $56m Series A funding round for SambaNova in 2018. Based in Palo Alto, California, the company has attracted investment from prominent entities including SoftBank Vision Fund 2 and BlackRock. In November 2025, SambaNova partnered with OVHcloud to enhance ultra-low latency inference solutions aimed at rapid processing across sectors such as financial trading and cybersecurity. This collaboration seeks to address the growing demand for faster data processing capabilities that are crucial in high-stakes environments where every millisecond counts. The partnership aims to unlock a wide range of use cases, potentially improving operational efficiency and reducing latency-induced errors in critical applications. By leveraging SambaNova’s technology, OVHcloud expects to deliver more responsive and reliable AI-driven solutions to its clients across various industries. Additionally, SambaNova secured an agreement in October 2025 with Infercom to deploy its SambaManaged platform for Europe’s first sovereign Inference-as-a-Service offering.

* Banks are 'cost winners' of AI boom, BlackRock says * European banks remain undervalued, despite strong rally * AI could add $340 billion annually to global banking, McKinsey By Joice Alves LONDON, Dec 15 (Reuters) - After a stellar 2025, investors expect shares in European banks to keep heading higher in 2026, supported by strong earnings and, crucially, cost savings stemming from artificial intelligence. As fears of a recession and interest rate cuts from the European Central Bank have subsided, investors have turned even more positive towards European banks, revising up their expectations for the sector, despite a complicated backdrop. Meanwhile, AI has emerged as a new force drawing investors to European lenders' shares, partly because a dearth of technology companies in the region has forced many to hunt for AI beneficiaries in old-economy markets. Banks have started to use AI to improve operational efficiency and fraud detection, as well as to reduce staff costs. "European banks could be a real beneficiary of AI," said Helen Jewell, chief investment officer for fundamental equities at BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, with about $12 trillion under management. "A lot of the AI story has been focused on the revenue winners, but we also know that when it comes to AI, there is a beneficiary from the cost winners," she said at a press event. UBS said in a note to investors they see AI as a key source of potential upside to banks' near-term valuations and longer- term earnings. But that comes with risks. Warnings over AI-related exuberance and the risks of a dot-com style bust have come from various sides, including the International Monetary Fund and the Bank of England. And risks aren't only AI-related. The ECB said euro zone banks face 'unprecedentedly high' risk of shocks including geopolitical tensions, shifting trade policies, climate-related crises and even a dollar squeeze for banks exposed to the volatile U.S. currency. Yet investors have snapped up bank stocks in earnest. Societe Generale shares have rallied 140% this year, Commerzbank 125% and those in Barclays rose almost 70%. An index of European bank stocks is up more than 60%, on top of the 25% gain in 2024 and more than four times better than the pan European index. Investors also view them as relatively cheap, particularly when compared with U.S. banking shares. European bank stocks currently trade around 1.17 times their price-to-book value, some 40% below their 2007 peak and below the 1.7 times of their U.S. rivals, according to LSEG data. EARNINGS EXPECTATIONS JUMP In terms of costs, Goldman Sachs said in a note that costs would grow at a compound annual rate of only 1% between 2025 and 2027. The U.S. bank also sees efficiency continuing well into 2026, with banks' cost/income ratios improving by 130 basis points year on year, meaning companies are expected to spend less to generate income. Consulting firm McKinsey estimated last year that AI could bring the global banking industry as much as $340 billion a year in additional value, with a drop in operational costs of 20%. Even if AI implementation savings take years to fully emerge, it will be a big enough shift to drive greater expansion in valuations, UBS said. Last month, analysts raised their net revisions for the sector by the most since May 2023, and 12-month forward earnings growth expectations jumped to the highest since 2023, according to IBES data. Growth in bank lending to euro zone firms is still running near its highest since mid-2023, according to the most recent ECB data. Credit growth to businesses was unchanged at 2.9% in October - just below August's 3%, the most since May 2023 - compared to the previous month, while loan growth to households accelerated to a 2-1/2-year high of 2.8% from 2.6%. BlackRock's Jewell expects European banks to return 20-25% of market value to shareholders over the next three years via dividends and share buybacks. "If you put together valuation and ... the shareholder remuneration, you still have an asset class that is quite attractive," Equita co-head of research Domenico Ghilotti said, adding that merger activity is another driver underpinning the sector. The takeover of Mediobanca by state-backed Monte dei Paschi di Siena was one of the biggest in the sector this year, transforming Italian banking. Other deals could be on the way. "What we are seeing is economic resilience within Europe, and that means that even if we do see more rate cuts, that economic resilience... will be good for European banks," BlackRock's Jewell said.

Title: This New Bitcoin Futures ETF Could Be Pulling All-Nighters

A new proposed ETF would hold bitcoin only after markets close. Lilly Riddle lilly@thedailyupside.com Wall Street has a new nighttime routine, and it’s not about remembering to wear a retainer. A new ETF would hold bitcoin products only during overnight hours after the markets close, shifting into short-term US Treasuries during the day, according to a filing last week with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The goal is to capitalize on bitcoin’s performance during the night and slumps during the day. The strategy, called the Nicholas Bitcoin and Treasuries AfterDark ETF (NGHT), is the latest intersection of digital assets and traditional finance. But some experts warned that the fund may let traders take advantage of the predictable and forced buys and sells. “[W]e took a 24/7 permissionless asset and somehow invented a night-shift ETF for it,” a crypto influencer wrote on X using the handle Blackthorne. “The real alpha is not owning time slices of bitcoin, it’s front‑running the tourists who think they can.” The idea behind the strategy is that investors would have higher returns by only trading bitcoin assets at night. For example, if an investor held the iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) only during after-hours trading, performance would be up 222% since January of last year, according to data from Bespoke Investment Group. In the same filing, Nicholas Financial also proposed a fund that would factor in time of day to its trading strategy, called the Nicholas Bitcoin Tail ETF (BHDG). The company’s other funds, however, have had mixed results this year: Crypto All Day, Every Day. Crypto strategies — from memecoin funds to crypto indexes — are flourishing under a new, laxer regulatory environment, with the SEC recently signaling its support for new spot crypto products. “I think the industry is maturing,” head of sector and industry research at VettaFi Roxanna Islam told ETF Upside. “Advisors and investors are seeing the value of diversification within the crypto space, not just using it to make single asset bets. So issuers are starting to look to diversify more among their crypto holdings.” The company is planning to add 10 target-maturity ETFs. Vanguard and State Street have also moved to fill out their bond-ladder lines. With more than $1.4 trillion in flows and more than 1,000 product launches, it’s safe to say the industry is booming. Wanna bet? ETFs aren’t for gambling, but a rise in risk-on products could prove irresistible to a population obsessed with sports betting. After a dive, the company’s stock is still up 8% in 2025, while both long and short leveraged ETFs are down. The world’s largest asset manager and issuer of the biggest crypto ETF is expanding into staked Ethereum. Is there room for anyone else? Active fixed-income strategies accounted for nearly half of ETF inflows so far this year. Niche strategies, like buffer ETFs, could play a larger role in deal activity. Its price is up 100%, significantly ahead of gold’s surge, and the (very) few silver ETFs on the US market have benefited. The company’s flagship ETF, QQQ, is just shy of enough votes to approve its reclassification as an open-end fund. Recent developments at Vanguard and Bank of America have boosted momentum for digital assets including bitcoin ETFs. The company on Tuesday reversed its ban on Bitcoin and other crypto ETFs, giving access to many of its 50 million clients. The rise of model portfolios has enabled issuers to choose funds in their best interest — not necessarily the client’s. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: Barclays Sees ‘Down-Year’ for Crypto in 2026 Without Big Catalysts

Barclays expects a more tepid year for crypto in 2026, with trading volumes trending down and investor enthusiasm waning. In a wide-ranging year-end report published Friday, the bank flagged a difficult backdrop for digital asset exchanges like Coinbase (COIN), citing unclear catalysts for renewed activity and a slow start to token adoption efforts. Retail-facing exchanges, which benefited from surging trading interest during the crypto bull runs of prior years, are now facing a more subdued environment. Barclays analysts noted that trading volume in spot markets — key revenue drivers for companies like Coinbase and Robinhood (HOOD) — has cooled sharply. Without a clear spark to reignite demand, volumes may remain muted. "Spot crypto trading volumes [...] appear to be trending towards a down-year in FY26, and it is not clear to us what might reverse this trend," the analysts wrote. Crypto markets tend to move on big events: policy announcements, product launches or political changes. Barclays pointed to past bursts of activity, like the March 2024 spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) inflows or the pro-crypto presidential win in November as key drivers of short-term spikes. But in the absence of such events, the bank sees structural growth as lacking. One area that could stir the market is regulation. Barclays highlighted the pending CLARITY Act, legislation that would help define the line between digital commodities and securities and clarify which U.S. agency — the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or the smaller Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) — regulates which assets. While not a guaranteed market mover, the bill could ease operational uncertainty for crypto companies and investors alike. If passed, it could open the door for clearer product launches, especially in tokenized assets. Coinbase remains a focal point in Barclays’ analysis. While the company is expanding into derivatives and tokenized equity trading, the bank sees headwinds from shrinking spot volumes and rising operating costs. "COIN has a number [of] growth initiatives as well as recent acquisitions that could start to become more impactful," the report stated. Nevertheless, analysts revised their price target for the stock down to $291, citing a more conservative earnings outlook. Tokenization continues to gain attention from both crypto-native and traditional finance firms. BlackRock (BLK), Robinhood (HOOD), and others have been piloting products in this space. But Barclays cautions the trend is early-stage and unlikely to materially impact earnings in 2026. Meanwhile, the U.S. political environment has turned more favorable for digital assets following recent elections. However, Barclays sees much of this optimism already priced into the market. Any legislative movement, like the CLARITY Act, would need to pass through the Senate and survive possible legal challenges before having any practical impact. In sum, 2026 may be a transitional year for crypto. With declining retail activity and no immediate tailwinds, companies are focusing on long-term bets like tokenized finance and compliance upgrades. Whether those investments bear fruit next year or further out remains uncertain.

HPS, which is owned by the world's biggest asset manager, is among the parties in discussions with CVC Capital's Global Sports Group about a major debt financing deal, Sky News learns. City editor @MarkKleinmanSky Sunday 14 December 2025 12:27, UK A division of Blackrock, the world's biggest asset manager, is in talks to provide hundreds of millions of pounds of funding to a company which owns stakes in Six Nations Rugby and the women's professional tennis tour. Sky News has learnt that HPS, the global private credit giant, is among the parties negotiating with CVC Capital Partners over the financing of its Global Sports Group (GSG) holding company. The talks, which are not exclusive, would see HPS help provide firepower for the CVC-backed vehicle to make further acquisitions to expand its portfolio. Chaired by Marc Allera, the former BT Group consumer boss, GSG holds stakes in Premiership Rugby, the top flights of French and Spanish football and the international volleyball tour. In recent weeks, Mr Allera has outlined his ambitions to acquire further global sports properties. HPS, which was acquired by Blackrock for $12bn late last year, is said to be serious about becoming involved in GSG. Other parties with whom CVC is in discussions include Ares Management, which is interested in providing both debt and equity to GSG, according to insiders. Out of a job and on benefits: Why Britain isn't working Unemployment rate jumps again, with young people worst affected Oil prices fall to lowest level since 2021 - and it could have big consequences for filling up your car | Money blog Any new financing package was expected to be secured on favourable terms for the CVC-controlled group because of the underlying credit quality of the assets in the portfolio. Sky News revealed during the summer that CVC had engaged a trio of banks to explore plans for a refinancing of what was at the time referred to internally as SportsCo and which has since been renamed Global Sport Group. The portfolio also includes an Indian Premier League cricket franchise, several of which are currently exploring sales at valuations of well over $1bn. Goldman Sachs, PJT Partners and Raine Group are advising on the refinancing of GSG, which has been set up to optimise CVC's investments in the sector. The deal is expected to allow CVC to remain invested in its sports portfolio for longer, while also paving the way for the sale of a minority stake in SportsCo or a future initial public offering. Having made billions of dollars from its ownership of Formula One motor racing - one of the most lucrative deals in the history of sport - CVC has bought stakes in leagues and other assets spanning a spectrum of elite sporting assets over the last two decades. Its investment in the media rights to La Liga - Spain's equivalent of the Premier League - is expected to generate a handsome return for the firm, although a comparable deal in France has faced significant challenges amid broadcasters' financial challenges in the country. CVC's backing of global sports properties is intended to position it to maximise their commercial potential through new media and sponsorship rights deals, as well as their expansion into new formats aimed at drawing wider audiences amid rapid shifts in media consumption. In rugby union, its acquisition of a stake in Premiership Rugby's commercial rights was hit by the pandemic and the subsequent financial pressures on clubs which saw a number of the league's teams forced into insolvency. CVC, which bought into Premiership Rugby in 2019, owns a 27% stake in the league. Its sporting assets will continue to remain autonomous and independent of one another, despite the new umbrella holding entity. One expected benefit of the SportsCo approach would be the sourcing of new investment opportunities, with CVC being linked to a bid for one of the new European NBA basketball franchises which is expected to be sold in the coming months. Global sports properties have become one of the hottest growth areas for private capital in recent years, with firms such as Ares, Silver Lake Partners and Bridgepoint all investing substantial sums in teams, leagues and other assets across the industry. CVC and Blackrock declined to comment.

Title: Vanguard Executive Compares Bitcoin To A ‘Digital Labubu’ Even As Firm Allows Client Access To Crypto ETFs

A senior Vanguard executive has asserted that Bitcoin is a purely speculative asset, likening it to a collectible toy, even as the Wall Street behemoth opened the door to crypto-tied exchange-traded funds. Speaking during Bloomberg’s ETFs in Depth conference in New York on Thursday, Vanguard’s global head of quantitative equity, John Ameriks, said that Bitcoin lacked the cash flow and compounding traits the company sought when evaluating long-term investments. According to Ameriks, Bitcoin still resembles a speculative collectible rather than an asset meant to build long-term wealth. In fact, he characterized the world’s largest and oldest crypto as a “digital Labubu,” referencing the viral plush collectibles. “It’s difficult for me to think about Bitcoin as anything more than a digital Labubu,” the exec postulated, highlighting what he called the lack of clear evidence that the underlying blockchain technology provides long-lasting economic value. Bitcoin has long been likened to speculative manias and collectibles, including Dutch tulip bulbs and Beanie Babies. Detractors have pointed to those analogies to contend that Bitcoin’s price gains have been spurred more by speculation than by real-world use cases. Despite Ameriks’ dismissive view, he suggested that Bitcoin could find real-world use cases beyond market speculation in the future in scenarios of high inflation or political instability. The comments from Ameriks followed Vanguard’s announcement earlier this month, allowing its 50 million clients to access funds holding cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ether, Ripple’s XRP, and Solana. “We allow people to hold and buy these ETFs on our platform if they wish to do so, but they do so with discretion,” Ameriks noted, adding that even with that access, Vanguard will not offer clients “advice as to whether to buy or sell or which crypto tokens they ought to hold.” Vanguard had previously said it would steer clear of crypto-related products, including the spot BTC ETFs offered by rivals BlackRock and Fidelity. The firm’s decision to now allow digital assets on its platform demonstrates how the worlds of traditional finance and cryptocurrency are continuing to merge. Despite begrudgingly reversing course, Vanguard does not intend to roll out its own crypto ETFs. This is notable given that spot BTC funds have become BlackRock’s biggest revenue drivers.

Title: Bitcoin To Retest $85,000 Mark In Coming Days – Here’s Why
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-to-retest-85000-mark-in-coming-days/
Time Published: 2025-12-14T03:00:13Z

Amid a steady price rebound in the Bitcoin (BTC) market, popular market analyst with the X username KillaXBT is predicting another significant correction in the forthcoming days. In an X post on December 12, KillaXBT outlines a cautious market insight that suggests Bitcoin is headed for a price pullback. According to the renowned analyst, the premier cryptocurrency has consistently recorded an 8% price decline after the 14th day of the last five months. KillaXBT describes this observation as the 14th Pivot, which now holds important implications for Bitcoin in the short term. Since hitting a price bottom of $80,000 in late November, BTC has formed an ascending channel, recording a steady series of higher lows and higher highs. However, KillaXBT’s projection is expected to break this channel, potentially halting the nascent uptrend. Going by the recurring price pattern, the analyst states Bitcoin investors should anticipate a minimum 5% price decline after the 14th of December, hinting at a potential retest of the 85,000-$86,000 price zone. Given the asset’s broader bullish market structure, such a move may represent nothing more than a short-term pullback. However, the prolonged correction seen earlier in Q4 has already set a precedent, leaving room for another phase of deeper downside should momentum weaken. In another X post, KillaXBT shares more bearish projections of the Bitcoin market. This time, the seasoned analyst predicts the crypto market leader will hit a price bottom of $48,905 despite recent price gains. KillaXBT’s bottom target represents Bitcoin’s price as of the approval of the BlackRock IBIT ETF, alongside 11 other Bitcoin Spot ETFs in January 2024. This projection is likely due to the common rationale that the present bullish run has been heavily supported by institutional inflows. Notably, the Bitcoin Spot ETFs have been central to these institutional inflows, boasting total net assets of $119.18 billion. The BlackRock IBIT holds over half of this traction as the undisputed market leader with $71.03 billion in net assets and $62.68 billion in cumulative net inflows. If Bitcoin were to return to its pre-ETF approval price levels, it would imply an estimated 46% decline from current market prices. Such a move would likely signal a sharp reversal in institutional positioning, suggesting that sustained ETF outflows, rather than retail capitulation, could emerge as the primary catalyst for a renewed crypto winter. At press time, Bitcoin continues to trade at $90,348, reflecting a 2.18% decline. Featured image from Pexels, chart from Tradingview For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Ripple’s Brad Garlinghouse Shares Key Institutional Signal, Makes Bold XRP Prediction For 2026‬
URL: https://zycrypto.com/ripples-brad-garlinghouse-shares-key-institutional-signal-makes-bold-xrp-prediction-for-2026/
Time Published: 2025-12-13T18:37:27Z
Full Content:
Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has outlined what he considers one of the clearest signs that institutional capital is finally entering the crypto market, despite recent volatility. Speaking at Binance Blockchain Week alongside Solana Foundation President Lily Liu and Binance CEO Richard Teng, Garlinghouse said XRP ETFs have already raised over $700 million in just a few weeks. According to Ripple’s CEO, that surge reflects pent-up demand from institutions that previously avoided the asset due to a lack of U.S. regulatory clarity. Garlinghouse emphasized that the shift in U.S. policy has been dramatically under-priced. With the world’s largest economy representing 22% of global GDP, the removal of long-standing regulatory hostility marks a critical turning point. Major financial firms, including Franklin Templeton, BlackRock, and even Vanguard, which once refused to touch crypto, are now entering the space. That situation fuels Garlinghouse’s strongest optimism for 2026. That said, Brad Garlinghouse noted that crypto still represents just 1–2% of the global ETF market. He dismissed concerns about short-term ETF outflows and declared there is “no chance” the asset class remains this small by 2026. For Ripple’s institutional brokerage arm, the trend is already visible: firms that stayed sidelined due to risk aversion or regulatory uncertainty are now beginning to “crawl, then walk, then run.” Moving on, Garlinghouse said the recent market turbulence has not scared institutions. “Definitely not,” he told the panel, arguing that volatility is pulling more interest in rather than pushing capital out. On the payments front, the Ripple CEO highlighted the company’s growing stablecoin business, which recently surpassed a $1 billion market cap and has secured approvals in Abu Dhabi, Dubai, and the DIFC. The company is seeing accelerating demand for stablecoin-based treasury flows, boosted further by upcoming U.S. legislation such as the GENIUS Act. Moreso, Ripple’s acquisition of GTreasury is reinforcing that momentum. Looking ahead, Garlinghouse expects meaningful U.S. regulatory legislation to pass in the first half of 2026, setting up what he believes could be a transformational year for XRP and the broader market.

Title: Vanguard Exec Likens Bitcoin to ‘Digital Labubu’ Even as Firm Opens ETF Trading Access

Vanguard’s global head of quantitative equity, John Ameriks, said bitcoin BTC$85,944.78 still resembles a speculative collectible more than an asset meant to build long-term wealth, comparing it to a “digital Labubu,” the plush toy that has become a popular collectible. Ameriks’ words came during Bloomberg’s ETFs in Depth conference in New York on Thursday, where he said bitcoin lacks the income, compounding, and cash-flow traits Vanguard seeks when it evaluates long-term investments. His dismissive stance comes as Vanguard just opened its platform to crypto exchange-traded funds, allowing its 50 million clients access to regulated investment vehicles from rivals like BlackRock and Fidelity. The asset management giant's begrudging embrace of crypto is a reversal of long-time skepticism towards the entire asset class. For years, Vanguard stood against offering cryptocurrency products to clients, reiterating that it saw digital assets as highly speculative and unaligned with its core investment philosophy. That view, according to Ameriks, apparently hasn’t changed. As a result, Vanguard does not plan to launch its own crypto-focused ETFs. The decision is notable as bitcoin ETFs have become BlackRock’s top revenue source. Still, after Vanguard saw crypto ETFs and funds “have been tested through periods of market volatility, performing as designed while maintaining liquidity,” the firm opened its brokerage platform to these products. Even with that access, Vanguard will not advise clients on whether to buy or sell crypto assets or which tokens to hold, Ameriks said. Ameriks said bitcoin could eventually show non-speculative value in certain conditions, such as high inflation or political instability, but he argued the evidence is still limited. “You’ve still got too short of a history,” he said.

Title: Surviving in ‘25: Was the year really as bad as it felt? - Liam Dann

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. US President Donald Trump. Photo / Carolyn Van Houten, The Washington Post THE FACTS How will we remember 2025? When it comes to the economy, the answer is: not fondly. It’s going to go down as the year of the recovery that didn’t happen. There is no question that the psychological blow of thinking an economic recovery had begun and then having it all dashed was substantial. It has cast a pall over the whole year, even though the data will show that we saw growth in the first quarter and that it (most likely) returned in the third and fourth quarters. We finally get third-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) numbers next week, and economists are expecting a strong bounce – perhaps as much as 1% for the quarter. We’ll also likely see revisions that show the terrible second quarter wasn’t as bad as we thought. We’ve had some promising data in the last few weeks that suggest the recovery has really gathered steam in the fourth quarter. Electronic card spending for November was much stronger than expected. So perhaps history will eventually show that 2025 wasn’t as bad as we thought it was. Unfortunately, how bad we thought it was is what counted while we were in it ... if that makes any sense. If we needed reasons to be gloomy, there was plenty of grim stuff – rising unemployment, business liquidations and stubborn inflation – to justify our mood. I should probably point out that this isn’t a preview for next week’s GDP release. This is officially my go at writing a year in review. It’s traditional in journalism to get these year-in-review pieces out early. No one wants to look back after Christmas. It’s more fun to speculate about the year ahead. Well, even more so this year, I reckon. There are plenty of businesses that will be more than happy to rule a line through this one. It’s the hope that kills you, people say – usually about their favourite sports team. So it was with the economy in 2025. But with what’s left of my weekly word count, let’s take a look at some of the highlights and lowlights. You can bet the Reserve Bank (RBNZ) will be relieved to see the back of 2025 after what has been, to quote the late great Queen, an annus horribilis (at least from an HR point of view). Controversy about the departure of Adrian Orr and the subsequent mess around the disclosure of information has been one of the biggest and most distracting economic stories of the year. The return of Donald Trump to the White House has also dominated news headlines. There have been so many big Trump headlines; some are saying the biggest, most impressive headlines in history. The big one that mattered most for New Zealand was Trump’s highly staged “Liberation Day” tariff show on the front lawn of the White House on April 2 (local time). With the weird pontification and bizarre mathematical workings, it might have been the year’s best comedy if it hadn’t delivered a very real blow to a global economy that didn’t need any more blows. Liberation Day coincided with the arrival of the second financial quarter, the one that delivered our GDP growth shocker – a 0.9% quarterly contraction. The Government and the RBNZ used the tariff shock as an explanation for the slump, but I’m yet to meet an economist who buys that line. New Zealand hasn’t had an issue with its export earnings in 2025. We’ve had record prices for meat, dairy and kiwifruit. Our economic issues have primarily been local. An exodus of Kiwis and a fall in arrivals have resulted in a crash in the net migration rate. That’s created a headwind for the property market, which has failed to recover. In fact, in Auckland and Wellington, property prices have kept falling. Consumers stopped spending and concentrated on saving and paying down debt – slowing the pass-through of interest rate cuts to retailers. Both business and consumer confidence (or mojo, as the PM calls it) went missing in action. The tariffs may have initially rattled local confidence too, but they quickly offered up a silver lining. They have reassured and reminded the world that we shouldn’t take anything Trump says at face value. Taco (Trump always chickens out) gets my vote for acronym of the year. Within weeks of Liberation Day, Trump was forced to back down on his hardline stance with China. Given China’s dominance of the vital rare-earth minerals trade, it always held all the cards. The delays to the US-China trade war showdown have kept coming. But despite interim tariffs in excess of 30% on Chinese goods, China has just reported a record US$1 trillion ($1.7t) trade surplus with the world. The standoff has also lifted Chinese President Xi Jinping’s popularity as he rides a wave of nationalist sentiment. As they say in China: Chuan Jianguo. Literally that means “Trump the nation-builder”, although in context, it’s a sarcastic play on the Maga slogan “Make America Great Again”. I visited China in September, and naturally, they showed me all the good stuff – so I might be a bit bullish. China’s had its problems in 2025 – an ongoing property slump, low consumer confidence, high youth unemployment – but losing the trade war has not been one of them. Faced with rising inflation at home, Trump has also been forced to back down on tariffs for meat, dairy and horticultural products. Financial markets have been a bright spot for the US economy in 2025 – underpinned by a frighteningly rapid artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. Wall Street has wobbled at times. But as we head into the silly season, financial markets look to have shaken off any fears we’re in an AI bubble. Big investors, like US investment giant BlackRock, have decided that the high-tech revolution is genuinely transformational and the hype is justified. Whether it’s good for humanity is another issue, but our KiwiSaver accounts may be safe to look at for a while yet. There’s still time for things to go wrong in 2025, of course. It might be all over bar the shouting, but sometimes the shouting can be consequential. We’ll see. I’ve got one more Sunday column left in me this year. Hopefully, the road is clear for a look ahead at what 2026 might bring ... Liam Dann is business editor-at-large for the NZ Herald.

Moneycontrol on December 10 was first to report Swiggy’s QIP had seen strong demand from investors across the board. From the mutual funds side SBI MF, ICICI Prudential MF, HDFC MF, Nippon India MF, Kotak MF, Mirae MF, Axis MF and Birla MF and others invested monies. On the insurance side ICICI Prudential Life Insurance and HDFC Life Insurance, among others, were key investors. Capital Group, Government of Singapore (GIC), BlackRock, Nomura Asset Management, Temasek, Fidelity and Goldman Sachs Asset Management among others are the key global investors who participated in Swiggy’s QIP. "The strong response to our QIP from both global and domestic institutional investors, including new investors since our IPO last year, reflects deep confidence in Swiggy’s business fundamentals, disciplined execution, and long-term value creation roadmap,” Sriharsha Majety, MD & Group CEO, Swiggy Limited, said. Swiggy said over 80 investors submitted bids and 61 one of them received allocations of which over 15 are new shareholders. “The additional capital provides us the flexibility to strengthen our core businesses, scale Instamart while maintaining financial prudence, and invest in innovation to continue to deliver unparalleled convenience,” Majety said. The largest portion of the QIP proceeds—Rs 4,475 crore—will be deployed towards expanding and operating Swiggy’s quick-commerce fulfilment network, including dark stores and warehouses that power Instamart. Swiggy plans to expand its fulfilment footprint from 5 million square feet as of November 30, 2025, to about 6.7 million square feet by December 2028. Another Rs 985 crore has been earmarked for technology and cloud infrastructure. The filing notes that Swiggy’s current cloud services agreement expires in February 2026, and that the company has entered into a non-binding letter of intent involving a proposed cloud commitment of Rs 1,820 crore over six years, locking in a significant forward technology spend. Swiggy has also allocated Rs 2,340 crore towards brand marketing and business promotion. The company disclosed that it has already issued purchase orders worth Rs 1,961 crore to marketing agencies for the December 2025–November 2027 period, pointing to sustained high customer acquisition and brand-building spends over the next two years. Of the $1.2 billion, about $1 billion (Rs 8,800 crore) have come from domestic MFs and the remaining $200 million or so have come from FIIs. With this Swiggy's cash balance of over Rs 14,000 crore, it has netted around Rs 2,400 crore by selling its stake in Rapido. The balance will now come close to Eternal's balance of Rs 18,314 crore as of Q2FY26.

Title: Brazil’s Largest Asset Manager Recommends Investors Put Up to 3% of their Money in Bitcoin to Hedge Against FX, Market Shocks

Brazil’s largest privately-owned asset manager, Itáu Asset Management, has recommended investors allocate 1% to 3% of their portfolios to bitcoin BTC$85,944.78. In a year-end note, Renato Eid, head of beta strategies and responsible investment for Itaú Asset Management, argued that bitcoin’s lack of correlation with traditional local assets makes it a useful diversification tool. The note echoes the bitcoin allocations recommended by other major asset managers. Earlier this month, Bank of America greenlit wealth advisors to recommend a BTC allocation of up to 4%, while BlackRock has pointed to 2%. Eid emphasized a measured approach, not turning crypto into the centerpiece of a portfolio but using it as a complementary asset that can help absorb shocks from currency depreciation and global volatility. “The idea is not to make cryptoassets the core of the portfolio but to include them as a complementary component — sized appropriately to the investor’s risk profile,” Eid wrote. This year, bitcoin surged to a record near $125,000 before falling back to around $90,000. For local investors, the ride was even bumpier due to currency fluctuations. Products like BITI11, a bitcoin ETF traded in Brazil, saw their performance in reais affected by the weakening fiat currency. But in periods of stress, such as late 2024, the global nature of BTC provided some insulation. Eid warned against trying to time the market and suggested a disciplined, long-term mindset. A small, steady exposure to bitcoin, he says, can act as a partial hedge and offer access to global returns, especially as traditional asset correlations become less reliable. “It calls for moderation and discipline: set a strategic slice (for example, 1%–3% of the total portfolio), keep a long-term horizon and resist the temptation to react to short-term noise,” Eid wrote.

Title: Why Binance’s Bitcoin Reserves Keep Falling – And Why It’s Actually Bullish‬

Bitcoin reserves on Binance have fallen to their lowest level in five years, according to new data from CryptoQuant. Despite BTC hovering near $93,000, analysts say the decline is not a bearish signal. Instead, it reflects deeper structural shifts that are typically associated with strong market conditions, not weakening ones. The largest driver behind the outflows is the accelerating move toward self-custody. As prices rise, long-term holders and high-net-worth investors increasingly transfer their BTC to cold wallets, removing potential sell pressure from exchanges. This pattern, historically typical in bull markets, signals confidence and long-term conviction rather than fear. That said, the rapid growth of spot Bitcoin ETFs builds on this. U.S. issuers, including BlackRock, Fidelity, and, more recently, Vanguard, are attracting heavy inflows. However, these assets are custodied outside centralized exchanges. As institutional capital moves into ETF structures, exchange reserves naturally shrink. Analysts view this as a structural sign of institutional adoption rather than distress. A third factor is the recent derivatives reset. The late-November sell-off triggered sweeping liquidations, particularly during Asian trading hours, reducing margin deposits and the amount of BTC held on Binance. This dynamic is short-term and mechanical, rather than reflective of a broader shift in sentiment. Binance’s recent compliance upgrades have also prompted some users to rebalance holdings. However, this represents regulatory normalization rather than negative pressure. Overall, a decline in exchange reserves typically tightens the circulating supply. That environment has historically supported medium- to long-term appreciation. The current trend aligns with a market in re-accumulation mode. In other news, corporate adoption and AI-driven models fuel forecasts above $150,000, and a break below the $102.6K support could validate bearish technical setups. Moreover, CoinMarketCap data shows that macro and technical conditions are supportive. BTC has rebounded 11% from November’s $82K low, helped by “seller exhaustion” after roughly $19 billion in liquidations cleared excess leverage. A bullish MACD crossover and neutral RSI suggest room for upward momentum, with resistance at $101K and support at $86.3K.

Title: BlackRock's head of talent acquisition reveals how AI has changed what he looks for in applicants

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. If you want to work at BlackRock, make sure you're using AI — just not too much. Nigel Williams, BlackRock's global head of talent acquisition, said that AI is shifting his hiring priorities, and that fluency with the technology is now key to any strong application. However, he warns against depending on it in the interview process. "We want to hire people that are curious, that understand that AI is here," he told Business Insider, especially because it's embedded in functions across the world's biggest asset manager. The strongest applicants can demonstrate that they are both digitally native and comfortable with various AI tools, and that they're curious about future capabilities. Young talent is "upskilling itself to meet the moment," Williams said, since applicants without a computer science background often demonstrate AI proficiency. Everyone, he added, will need to have a basic understanding of prompt engineering and how to question AI outputs. "In this age of AI, the talent skills that I think we need more than ever are people that are curious, have a questioning mindset, and are willing to not just trust what the model puts out there, but also make sure we're continuing to pressure test that," he said. Strong interpersonal and relationship-building skills are also becoming even more important, he said. Williams said that his team is figuring out how to assess applicants' AI abilities and is mindful of making sure people without tech backgrounds don't feel intimidated. He's interested in how people use the technology in their personal, academic, or work lives, and said his team is still fine-tuning how to assess that in the interview process. Despite Williams' new focus on how applicants engage with AI, he's not using it to screen candidates. As of now, he uses AI to schedule interviews. There's such a thing as too much AI in the application process, though. Williams said recruiters and hiring managers have told people ahead of an interview not to use an AI tool, sometimes to little avail. "It is quite common. You will sometimes see people looking to the left or the right. Our interviewing teams, if they're in the middle of doing that, will pick up on that and be able to say, 'Hey, we do want to make sure that you're staying focused,'" Williams said. BlackRock employs around 24,600 people in more than 30 countries, according to a November 5 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Some 21,100 people worked at the firm as of the end of 2024, according to that year's annual report. BlackRock has launched Asimov, an agentic AI platform for its equity business. At the annual New York Times DealBook Summit this week, its CEO, Larry Fink, said that there will be "some huge winners and huge failures" with the technology. Jump to

Title: ‘Digital labubu’: Why Vanguard still refuses to endorse Bitcoin

Can Bitcoin thrive when its biggest gatekeepers refuse to believe in it? Bitcoin retreated from its recent peak as selling pressure returned across the broader market. At press time, BTC traded near $92,000, extending a drawdown from its recent high, according to Bloomberg data. The pullback revived familiar concerns around Bitcoin’s boom-and-bust cycles, even as institutional access continued to expand. The latest weakness coincided with sharp criticism from Vanguard, one of the world’s largest asset managers. Despite opening its platform to allow clients to trade spot Bitcoin [BTC] ETFs, the firm doubled down on its skepticism. Speaking at Bloomberg’s ETFs in Depth event in New York, John Ameriks, Vanguard’s Global Head of Quantitative Equity, directly addressed the question of Bitcoin’s investment merit, dismissing the asset with a mocking comparison. He described the world’s largest cryptocurrency as a “digital Labubu,” referring to the viral elf-like plush toy. Ameriks used this comparison to reinforce Vanguard’s core view: Bitcoin produces “no income, no compounding, and no cash flow.” As a result, the $12 trillion asset manager treats it as a “collectible rather than a productive asset.” Moreover, Ameriks strengthened his argument by saying the firm has seen “no proof that the technology behind it offers lasting economic value.” His analogy continues a tradition of critics comparing Bitcoin to speculative manias, such as 17th-century Dutch tulips and 1990s Beanie Babies. These comparisons suggest that Bitcoin’s value is driven by scarcity narratives and the “greater fool theory,” rather than intrinsic utility or cash flows. The irony of Amerik’s comments is starkly highlighted by the dramatic policy shift that preceded them. Recently, Vanguard, under the leadership of newly appointed CEO Salim Ramji, a former BlackRock executive with a background in crypto, reversed its years-long resistance to digital assets. The firm, managing approximately $12 trillion in assets, allows clients to trade crypto-focused ETFs that hold coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum [ETH], Ripple [XRP], and Solana [SOL] on its brokerage platform, effectively placing them alongside gold and other mainstream assets. Ameriks said the decision followed the January 2024 debut of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which helped stabilize market infrastructure and liquidity. However, he emphasized that Vanguard offered access without endorsement or investment guidance. “We allow people to hold and buy these ETFs on our platform if they wish to do so, but they do so with discretion. We’re going to not give them advice as to whether to buy or sell, or which crypto tokens they ought to hold.” Vanguard’s decision, therefore, represents a profound paradox at the heart of the maturing crypto market. The world’s second-largest asset manager began offering access to crypto ETFs and related mutual funds to its more than 50 million brokerage customers on the 2nd of December. This monumental policy shift, which dramatically reversed Vanguard’s anti-crypto stance in 2024, was driven by rising client demand. Andrew Kadjeski, head of brokerage and investments at Vanguard, said the ETF structure had “proven resilient during volatility” and maintained robust liquidity. At the same time, Vanguard mocks Bitcoin as a “digital Labubu” and avoids launching its own crypto products, showing it wants to meet demand without endorsing the asset.

Title: 'Time for gloves off': Asking religious orders nicely to pay redress hasn't worked, says Bacik

IT’S TIME TO take the gloves off and force religious orders to pay redress to their victims, according to Labour leader Ivana Bacik. Her party has put forward a Bill that seeks to enact landmark legislation to ensure that religious institutions, associated trusts, and other unincorporated organisations be held liable for historic child sexual abuse committed in their care. Tánaiste Simon Harris, when Taoiseach, said he expected those who speak Christianity to practice it, stating that the government has “levers” to ensure the religious orders pay up. He told The Journal last year that he had asked the Attorney General to draft legal advice for government about what mechanisms can be deployed or what legislation could be introduced to make sure that institutions have to contribute towards redress. However, since then, there has been no progress with the legislation. Bacik said in her previous life as a barrister, she represented many survivors of abuse in industrial schools, and she described the residential institutions redress board as “a flawed process” that has been subject to much critique. “One of the key issues was that the religious orders simply were not not paying their share of the redress… what has happened over decades is that religious orders have transferred their assets to lay-run trusts,” she said. Advertisement An example is the government-established Mother and Baby Institutions Payment Scheme, which sought for religious bodies to contribute around €270m to the costs. However, only two of eight religious bodies linked to Mother and Baby Homes in Ireland offered to contribute. The Sisters of Bon Secours offered €12.97m, while the Daughters of Charity of St Vincent de Paul proposed contributing a building to the scheme. Since then, there is a whole new cohort of people who have come forward with claims of abuse, with Bacik mentioning David and Mark Ryan, who were featured in the RTÉ’s Doc on One programme ‘Blackrock Boys’. In more recent times, claims have “absolutely exploded”, said Bacik, noting that the new scoping inquiry into sexual abuse in schools run by religious orders identified 42 religious orders, over 300 schools and 3,000 allegations. “And that’s just the tip of the iceberg.” “So we drafted a bill to enable proceedings to be taken against an unincorporated body, which is the legal status of a religious order, so that survivors or the State can pursue for unpaid redress,” she said. Bacik said there shouldn’t be a delay in taking action, stating that she believes this sort of legislation can run parallel to the Commission of Investigation into the Handling of Historical Child Sexual Abuse in Schools, which is ongoing. The commission will investigate the handling of allegations or concerns of historical child sexual abuse in all day and boarding schools in Ireland, including special schools, which occurred between 1927 and 2013. “I’m disappointed that the lack of action by government, because, in fact, I spoke in the Dáil two years ago on this, and the then-minister said he was very interested, and said that he would go to the Attorney General and look for advice… nothing’s happened since the scoping inquiry was established,” she said. Related Reads €86 million cash in the bank, but the majority of religious organisations haven't offered any redress Redacted Lives: Catch up on our documentary series about Mother and Baby Homes Redacted Lives: Why survivors felt let down by the Commission into Mother and Baby Homes “For decades, successive governments and ministers have gone cap in hand to the religious orders, and frankly, it’s time for gloves off. No more of this asking nicely, because the religious orders are digging their heels in. They’re protecting their assets, and it’s just not good enough. “We need this legal mechanism to be able to get behind these legal entities, and be able to secure a redress for survivors. We know the wealth religious orders and their trusts are sitting on is huge,” the Labour leader said. The Journal reported earlier this year that almost all religious orders in Ireland have millions of euros in cash and assets. The eight religious bodies with historical involvement in mother and baby homes have combined net assets of €1.32 billion and cash deposits of €86 million. In a statement from the Department of Education regarding where progress is when it comes to legislation, a spokesperson said the scoping inquiry into historical sexual abuse in day and boarding schools run by religious orders, a Commission of Investigation has been established by the government. They noted that inquiry’s report also recognised the significance of the issue of redress for survivors and their expressed wish that those running schools where child sexual abuse occurred should be held accountable financially. “It recommended that consideration be given by the government to establishing a redress scheme for survivors. The high-level Inter Departmental Group (IDG) established to advise Government on the recommendations of the Scoping Inquiry also recognised redress as an important element of accountability for survivors and advised in its report that, based on knowledge of other schemes in the State and beyond, further detailed research and data analysis work needs to be undertaken on the consideration of any potential redress scheme that may be established in the future. “This work is ongoing and will continue in parallel to the work of the Commission, which does not have a role in relation to redress. “Given the complex issues involved, it is clear that further analysis and significant legal consideration will be required in assessing any proposed legislation to be brought forward in this regard,” the concluded.

The Bateman Cup will have a new name on the trophy after Clontarf host Ballynahinch in the final at Castle Avenue on Saturday (kick-off 4pm) in a game that also doubles up as a Division 1A match and will be televised live on irishrugby+). Clontarf, unbeaten at home this season and defending 1A champions, are in their first Bateman final in a decade. Former UCD back three player Ross Deegan is fit again and starts on the wing, with Hugo Lennox at fullback, meaning Tadhg Bird and Alex O’Grady each shift to midfield. Up front, Andy Wood has picked an unchanged front five with Alex Soroka back from Leinster duty and the fit-again Jordan Coghlan both restored to the backrow. Hinch, in their first final, are also seeking a first win over ‘Tarf, who have completed the double over them in each of the last four seasons, for the first time since 2020. Paul Kerr moves from inside centre to outhalf in the absence of James Humphreys, who is on the bench for Ulster, tighthead Tom McAllister and number eight Bradley Luney return among five changes all told. The other four matches kick off at 2.30pm, with leaders St Mary’s (33 pts) hosting Lansdowne in third (23 pts). They welcome back fit-again talisman Conor Dean, with the prolific Mick O’Gara reverting to “12″ and Dan Goggin to “8″. Lansdowne promote scrumhalf James Kenny and inside centre Tom Daly, while Bobby Sheehan reverts to blindside in a new backrow alongside Ross O’Neill and Barry Fitzpatrick. After slipping to fourth following successive defeats, Terenure (25pts) head to Ollie Campbell Park to face Old Belvedere in eighth for a first AIL meeting since 2017. Chris Cosgrave moves to outhalf and Adam La Grue to fullback, with Connacht centre John Devine, all-time leading try scorer Craig Adams and scrumhalf Griffin Culver all restored. Ben Blaney is recalled and Harrison Brewer reverts to lock. Although Young Munster will welcome Conor Bartley’s call-up for Munster, Ger Slattery still retains all but three of the side which beat Terenure last week when they host Nenagh. UCD, boosted by last week’s 43-38 win at Lansdowne, have Andrew Osborne back on the right wing for the visit of Cork Constitution, who have won their last two and whose only change is a rotation at hooker, where Billy Scannell starts and Danny Sheahan is on the bench. In 2A and 2B, the AIL’s last unbeaten sides, MU Barnhall and Galwegians, are at home to Galway Corinthians and Skerries. Due to pitch conditions the AIL Junior Cup semi-final being played tomorrow between Seapoint and Athy will now be played at St Michael’s College, Dublin 4 on their 4G pitch.

Title: Is testosterone the quick fix for women in midlife?

Humanity has always chased the promise of renewed youth. From ancient myths about the fountain of life to modern Silicon Valley regimes of supplements, sensors and self-tacking biohackers, the supposed elixir may change over time, but the desire for eternal youth remains the same. Today it appears everywhere, and it is often split along gendered lines. For women, the pursuit tends to be aesthetic, shaped by a culture that treats ageing as a flaw to be corrected via Botox, fillers, or – increasingly among actresses barely in their mid-30s – a facelift. Men, meanwhile, are urged to optimise. An entire industry of podcasts, tech devices and protocols encourages them to track their biomarkers, adapt their sleep cycles, and follow elaborate nutritional codes. It’s a thriving market built on the belief the body, ageing, time itself can all be mastered and controlled with enough science, discipline and money. Into this landscape enters a new supposed miracle tonic for women: testosterone. It may be a hormone as old as time, but it’s being worshipped with a new fervour. Influencers and wellness clinics are peddling unregulated, high-dose testosterone to women, promising not just heightened libido but sharper focus, renewed purpose and a vitality dormant for years. Some of the stories sound almost mythic. Women describe bounding out of bed, lifting heavier weights, rediscovering sexual desire, and feeling newly energised at work and at home. In one recent New York Times piece, women described sex going from “How about never?” to six times a week; marriages transformed, energy levels electrified, all apparently down to testosterone. The problem is, most of the claims about testosterone are simply not borne out by evidence. Step away from the viral testimonies and influencer marketing spiels and into the consulting rooms of clinicians who specialise in hormonal care, and the story of testosterone becomes far more measured, more grounded, more wary. This research-backed, evidence-based medical view is not anti-testosterone; it’s just anti-magic. Though long framed as the defining male hormone, testosterone is no more exclusively masculine than oestrogen is exclusively feminine; both circulate in all bodies, and both matter profoundly. “Testosterone is the third hormone that your ovaries make, along with oestrogen and progesterone,” explains Dr Caoimhe Hartley, the clinical lead in women’s medicine at the newly opened Blackrock Health Women’s Health Centre. “It has an impact on bone density, muscles, probably cognition and sexual function, and that is where libido comes in. All these hormones do multiple things; they are not isolated to one usefulness.” What testosterone does not do is plummet dramatically at menopause, despite the common misconception. “There is no study that has shown any change over natural menopause,” says Prof Susan Davis, an endocrinologist at Monash University whose work has shaped global understanding of female testosterone. “Testosterone blood levels decline slowly from the age of about 20 through to the age of about 60,” she explains. Over those 40 years, she says, “on average, normal women will have about a 50 per cent decline.” Then, unexpectedly, levels start to creep up again from about 60. “It is changing with age, not menopause.” This distinction matters because it reframes midlife experiences. Changes that women may experience in metabolism, energy and mood are often misattributed to a sudden drop in testosterone, when the real cause may be the cumulative effects of ageing, stress, workload and emotional demands. But if testosterone drops over time and these emotional and embodied changes are experienced, a question naturally arises: does putting more testosterone into the body help? For premenopausal women, the answer right now is simply: we do not know. Two trials have hinted at some possible benefits for women in their late 30s and early 40s, “but the studies are too small to have any degree of confidence”, Davis says. Another trial is planned, but for now, “there is no good evidence that giving premenopausal women testosterone will be beneficial”. For postmenopausal women, the picture is clearer, though still limited. “All the published studies show that the only evidence of benefit is for postmenopausal women who are bothered by low libido,” Davis says. Her own meta-analysis of 36 trials involving 8,480 women found consistent improvements in desire, arousal, orgasm and overall sexual satisfaction. Though more modest than the accounts of teenage boy-levels of sexual desire experienced in women on high doses, these research-backed improvements were meaningful. “The beneficial effects for postmenopausal women shown in our study extend beyond simply increasing the number of times a month they had sex,” she says. “Many women who are sexually active report dissatisfaction, so increasing the frequency of a positive sexual experience from never or occasionally to once or twice a month can improve self-image and reduce concerns and distress.” Hartley sees the same patterns clinically. In Ireland, doctors can prescribe testosterone for women, but only off-label and only in carefully selected cases, such as postmenopausal women distressed by low libido. Because no female-specific product is licensed here, clinicians like Hartley rely on precisely titrated-down doses of male testosterone gels, monitored with blood tests to keep levels within a normal female range. She prescribes testosterone when low libido is causing distress, usually after menopause or after surgical removal of the ovaries. “It makes a bit of physiological sense,” she says of its use following surgical menopause, “but it is still for low libido and nothing else”. Beyond this specific use for improving libido for older or postmenopausal women, the evidence around the benefits of testosterone therapy for women fades. “No benefits have been shown for cognition, bone mineral density, body composition, muscle strength or psychological wellbeing at physiological doses,” Davis says of the clinical trials to date. “There simply isn’t evidence.” If testosterone’s proven benefits are relatively modest, why do some women who’ve taken it sound as if they have been converted to a new faith? Part of the answer is placebo. “There is a huge placebo effect, and everybody is in complete denial of this placebo effect,” Davis says. She points to a company that developed a testosterone gel for women and then ran two large trials of libido, each with 500 participants. “Testosterone improved libido, but not better than placebo,” she says. In her own 800-woman trial of a testosterone patch, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, women on testosterone had better sexual function than those on placebo. But when the team buried validated wellbeing questionnaires inside the study, they found no difference in general wellbeing at all. Hartley encounters the anecdotal power of testosterone every day. “I have patients who will come back and say, ‘I went on testosterone and my brain fog improved’ – and I am not in their brain, I cannot tell them that they are wrong.” The problem is that individual stories, which are very real to the woman telling them, are not the same as evidence. “How do you remove all the other things that may have helped? How do we know it is not placebo?” Hartley asks. “That is why we do studies.” But when women are looking for answers and hear one or two stories saying, ‘This transformed my life’, the effect is infectious. “It is human nature to want to believe it,” Hartley says. This gap between evidence and promise is sharpened by what happens outside regulated medical practice. In the US, an increasingly booming, unregulated industry of influencers and wellness clinics is offering female clients testosterone pellets and gels at doses that take women well beyond a normal female range for the hormone. At those levels, the side effects can be alarming: scalp hair loss, unwanted facial hair, acne, irritability, voice deepening, clitoral enlargement, and surges of arousal that disrupt daily life. Some of these side effects, like clitoral enlargement and voice changes, can be irreversible. Hartley notes that such dramatic changes “really should only occur if your testosterone level is bumped outside of a normal female range” – yet in unregulated settings, that boundary is routinely crossed. In countries like the United Kingdom or Australia, women have access to a licensed female-specific testosterone cream that allows safe, standardised dosing. In countries like the US or Ireland, without such a product, the gap between evidence-based prescribing and unregulated hormonal experimentation is widening, leaving women vulnerable to treatments that promise transformation but bypass the safeguards of medical care. “Knowing that this is an option that might help them, women are forced to use either compounded therapies or try microdose male options,” Davis says of countries without an approved product. “That is really where things go out the window, because it is very difficult to safely dose using very concentrated male formulations.” In her view, “the best thing to protect women is a regulated product”, one tailored to female physiology. Hartley would welcome the UK’s new female-specific cream for similar reasons. It contains the same active ingredient as existing male gels, she notes, just at a concentration and formulation that makes it easier to apply in tiny doses. Regulation, though, is not enough on its own – doctors need to understand the drug and how best to help their patients. For Hartley, the safeguard is information. “The more we have well-educated healthcare professionals at every level,” she says, “the more we are passing that on to women.” She wants GPs and specialists who are “well armed with information on what is evidence-based and what is rubbish”, so that they can help patients sift through hype and anecdote. Both Hartley and Davis think the fervour around testosterone says as much about the state of women’s lives as it does about the hormone itself. “I think women are sick of their symptoms being dismissed,” Davis says. “And when someone says this will make you feel better, of course, they want to take it. I get that, and I think that is perfectly reasonable.” Davis’s team has documented the decline in women’s quality of life at mid-age. Despite a huge amount of cultural discourse focusing on the so-called male loneliness epidemic, the documented mental health struggles of middle-aged women remain unacknowledged. “Women are suffering,” she says. “We have shown in our latest work that midlife wellbeing has gone down compared to 10 years ago. There is a real decline.” Davis explains the multitude of factors affecting women, noting: “This is the sandwich generation. Women trying to ‘have it all’: have children, take care of ageing parents, have work, have work-life balance, have financial stability. These are enormous pressures.” Depression rates are high, distress is high, and time is scarce. Hartley is watching the same pressures play out in Irish consulting rooms. “You see how much women are carrying,” she says. “It is no wonder their libido is low or that they feel flat or foggy or depleted. That is not a pathology. It is life.” Amid all the stresses affecting women, it thus becomes necessary to be careful of how we speak about women and low libido, in order not to pathologise a lack of desire that may be natural or due to a host of interlocking external factors, or to risk reinforcing damaging ideas about women owing their bodies and sexual availability to others. Neither doctor wants to minimise the distress of women whose sexual desire has vanished. Both prescribe testosterone in carefully selected cases, understanding the stakes for relationships and for individual self-esteem. “Our own research has shown that if women themselves personally have poor sexual wellbeing, that impacts them personally in their general wellbeing and their relationships,” Davis says. “So I prescribe testosterone for women with low libido. I am not anti-testosterone.” But what does concern Davis and Hartley is how the issue of women’s libido is often medicalised or framed. Hartley notes how many women come in apologising, or framing their lack of desire as a personal failure or a dereliction of duty to their partners. “Women come in saying, ‘Oh my God, my poor husband, my poor partner’,” says Hartley, who is always clear in redirecting them. “I say, ‘Your partner is not my patient’.” The real question is whether the woman herself is distressed. “It’s really important to not stick it on the list as something that has to be fixed. Low libido is not a disease,” says Hartley, who notes that it is a normal evolution for spontaneous sexual desire to reduce as you get older. ”That is universal. There is nothing wrong with you if that happens.” Davis notes that often, low libido is a “multifactorial condition”, and she points out that the guidelines from the International Society for the Study of Women’s Sexual Health set out a process of care that requires clinicians to look first at depression, relationship dynamics, medications, trauma, pain and vaginal health before they “jump in saying testosterone is going to be the fix”. Underpinning all of this, both the hope and the caution, is a simple fact: there is not enough research into women’s health, which leaves us without the data that women deserve. “The future, hopefully, is research,” Hartley says. Without larger, longer, better trials, she and her colleagues cannot give women the clear answers they want about benefits and risks. Davis has spent four decades trying to generate that data and sounds, at times, weary. Getting funding is brutally hard, she says; she can spend “up to 30 per cent” of her working time writing grant applications. When money does come through, another hurdle appears. “Trying to get women to go into clinical trials is an absolute no,” she says. “They are all too busy, busy.” Her team is about to start two large new studies, one looking at testosterone’s effects on muscle and bone, the other at bone and sexual function, both including wellbeing questionnaires. She welcomes the increased interest but insists that until the trials report, the honest answer to many questions will remain “we do not know”. That is not a comfortable message in a culture that wants a quick fix for midlife female exhaustion and desire. It is, however, the only message that treats women as adults and demands better for them in the long term. So what should an Irish woman do, sifting through a wave of hyped-up Instagram adverts about testosterone pellets and listicles of anecdotes about life-changing results? “Keep expectations realistic,” Davis says. If you are going to try testosterone, she urges, treat it as a time-limited trial, not a new identity. Do not try to treat bone loss, muscle fatigue or life itself with testosterone. “Testosterone is not the answer for life.” Hartley, for her part, hopes women will come in to talk, not arrive convinced that there is only one solution. “If they are symptomatic, if they have low libido and it is bothering them, and they want to have a discussion with their GP about it, do that,” she says. But she also wants them to hear something that often gets lost in the hype: “You are not broken.” She’s right. There is nothing inherently wrong about wanting sex less as you age. There is also nothing shameful about wanting more. But there is something deeply shameful about a society that devalues women; refuses to invest in research about their physical or emotional wellbeing; pathologises them for ageing and constantly tells them that they are not enough, only to try then make money selling them an unsafe, unregulated “cure”. Women deserve acceptance, accurate information and autonomy, not another marketplace built on their insecurity. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

I am fortunate enough to celebrate Christmas twice each year, enjoying a Danish feast featuring pork and duck on Christmas Eve and the traditional Irish turkey dinner the following day. In the past, I did not open up my finest wines, but now the children have grown older so I am happy to serve some very nice wine. Usually, we enjoy a good mature Bordeaux on Christmas Eve, and a nice pinot noir or cool climate syrah on Christmas Day. I will cover sparkling wine next week, but a glass of something fizzy is a great way to get proceedings started and can be drunk throughout the meal. This is the time to open some of the fortified traditional Christmas wines. I also make room for a dessert wine of some sort. This year it will be the Château des Arroucats (€18.95, Mitchell & Son). I will certainly open a bottle of Amontillado sherry as well as a bottle of Port. I will then alternate between an after-dinner glass of sherry with cheese and walnuts one evening, and a glass of Port the next, either with cheese or a generous slice of Christmas cake. My sherry will be a bottle of Lustau Tabanco Amontillado (€23.95, Mitchell & Son) and the Port a late bottled vintage, Niepoort LBV (€28-30, independents). If that is outside your budget, try the Armilar LBV Port (Lidl €14.99). O’Briens has a big range of wines on offer, including those in its fine wine sale which started on December 1st. I have featured the refreshing Picpoul de Pinet (€12.99) before, as well as the classic Brocard Chablis (€22.99). I am a big fan of the Begude wines and would also be tempted by the very well-priced Etoile Chardonnay (€18.99). From the reds, the Château des Léotins (€11.99) offers good value, and would go with red meats or goose. The classic Cru Bourgeois Chateau Saint Bonnet Médoc 2018 (€17.99) is a step up in price and quality. The Seguin Manuel Bourgogne Pinot Noir (€27.49) would be a good choice for turkey and trimmings. Lastly, a small glass of the honeyed Les Carmes de Rieussec (€18.99 per half-bottle) would be a nice end to the meal. For fans of sauvignon, Aldi has the fruit-filled Touraine Sauvignon Blanc – very good value at €9.99. If you fancy trying something different, its Austrian Orange Wine (€11.99) is full of exotic (and orange) fruits with a light tannic bite on the finish. For your Christmas dinner you could either go for the light, fruit filled Specially Selected Fleurie (€13.99) or the more powerful rounded Specially Selected Cairanne (€11.99). From Lidl, I would recommend three white wines; the lemon-scented Rías Baixas Albariño Salne Val (€11.99), the crisp dry Fiano Salento (€10.99) and the luscious Origen Roussanne Reserva from Chile (€8.99). My pick of the Lidl reds for Christmas dinner includes the ripe and full-bodied Pure Grenache (€11.99), and the ever-popular Valpolicella Ripasso (€10.99) Traditionalists might prefer the Ermita Rioja Crianza (€13.99). A post shared by The Irish Times (@irishtimesnews) Regular readers will know I am also a big fan of the Laurent Miquel wines from Dunnes Stores, including the Laurent Miquel Côte 128 Viognier and the Côte 128 Albariño, both bargains at €12. Dunnes also has the Guigal Côtes du Rhône Blanc (€15) a rich viognier-dominated white that would go well with fish and turkey. I also enjoyed its smooth spicy 409 Ribera del Duero (€15), possibly best with roast beef or goose. Light and zesty, the Tesco Finest Pecorino (€12/€9) would go nicely with shellfish starters, and so too would its crisp dry Tesco Finest Chablis (€26). For a red wine, the Alegro Rioja (€15/€10) offers good value at the Clubcard price, as does the Chapoutier Côtes du Rhône Villages (€15/€12). To finish off, the Tesco Finest Sauternes (€18/€17 per half-bottle) is rich and honeyed with apricots and barley sugar. [ Favourite picks from Dublin’s longstanding independent wine shopsOpens in new window ] From SuperValu, the Goichot Pouilly-Fuissé looks well-priced at €15. Fresh and lightly textured, it could be drunk throughout the dinner. I have covered the Vacqueyras Rémy Ferbras before; smooth and rounded it offers good value at €10 and would go nicely with chicken and red meats. Also on offer are two perennial favourites, the Goichot Fleurie (€10) and the Château Lacombe-Cadiot from Bordeaux (€12). Can any wine be worth €140? I am not sure, but if somebody else is paying, I would very happily drink the Meursault Genevrières Premier Cru Latour-Giraud 2023 (€139, Whelehan’s), a superb complex white Burgundy, textured, ripe and rich with a wonderful lingering finish. Floral with broad textured mouthwatering green fruits and a distinctive saline finish. This is one of my favourite white wines and a great choice for Christmas dinner. From O’Briens An instantly drinkable wine with very supple savoury ripe plums and light tannins. One of my red wines of the year. From Lilith, Dublin 7; Pinto, Dublin 9; Green Man Wines, Dublin 6; Lennox Street Grocer, Dublin 8; Grapevine, Dalkey, Co Dublin; 64 Wine, Glasthule, Co Dublin; MacCurtain Wine, Cork; Baggot Street Wines, Dublin 2; BaRossa, Sandymount, Dublin 4 A delicious pure chardonnay with concentrated pear and apple fruits, toasted hazelnuts and a lingering finish. From WineSpark.com Elegant smooth and sophisticated, with supple savoury dark cherries and blackcurrants, fine tannins and a long finish. Try it with turkey, beef or goose. From Blackrock Cellar, Co Dublin; Bradley’s, Cork; Delgany Wine Cottage, Co Wicklow; Pinto, Dublin 9; The Corkscrew, Dublin 2; Wineonline.ie Exclusive competitions and restaurant offers, plus reviews, the latest food and drink news, recipes and lots more © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Trump gives Elon Musk a win over a longtime foe | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks President Donald Trump on Thursday ordered a review of two major proxy advisory firms — companies that advise shareholders on votes — that had previously drawn the ire of Tesla CEO Elon Musk and others in Corporate America. The executive order singles out the two biggest players in the market: Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis. Proxy advisory firms like ISS and Glass Lewis provide recommendations on how major investors like pension funds should vote on corporate decisions and at shareholder meetings — sometimes to the consternation of other shareholders or even corporate executives. Trump’s executive order directs the Securities and Exchange Commission to review ISS and Glass Lewis specifically scrutinizing their use of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) and environmental, social and governance policies (ESG). “Even if no immediate rules change, boards, institutional investors and the firms themselves take notice,” Kerry Berchem, a partner at Akin and co-leader of the firm’s corporate governance and activism practice, told CNN. “This can influence behavior indirectly — firms may alter recommendations, increase transparency, or adjust methodologies to avoid conflict with regulators.” The order is a win for Musk, who has bemoaned ISS and Glass Lewis’ role in advising shareholders. The advisory firms have previously recommended that investors vote against corporate decisions at Tesla like giving Musk a larger pay package. Some on Wall Street have also previously voiced concern about proxy advisory firms’ sway over shareholders’ decisions. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has argued against the companies, calling them “incompetent.” Elon Musk said he needs $1 trillion to stop ‘corporate terrorists’ from wresting control of Tesla ISS and Glass Lewis “use their substantial power to advance and prioritize radical politically-motivated agendas,” including DEI and ESG, according to the order. These proxy advisory firms have offered research and advice that incorporates ESG investing, which has been slammed by many conservatives. Under pressure from the Trump administration, Corporate America has seen a broad shift away from DEI and ESG policies that were more widely embraced a few years ago. “President Trump and many Republican allies have made clear their concerns about ‘woke capitalism’ — the idea that corporations, investors, or advisors push political or social agendas (like ESG, DEI, climate policies) that he views as contrary to shareholder financial interests or traditional US economic priorities,” Berchem said. “President Trump’s move won’t immediately change proxy advice, but it signals scrutiny, assuredly rattles the industry and subtly shifts the power dynamic toward corporate boards,” she added. ISS, founded in 1985, and Glass Lewis, founded in 2003, advise major institutional investors like BlackRock, pension funds and a range of other asset managers. ISS and Glass Lewis are owned by companies in Germany and Canada, respectively. Institutional investors that manage up to trillions of dollars can invest in so many companies that, when it comes to annual shareholder meetings and votes, they need more insight on what to decide. Proxy advisory firms conduct research and advise on how to vote on decisions including, but not limited to, executive compensation, board structure, climate and environmental issues and potential mergers and acquisitions. “I question whether American corporate governance should be determined by for-profit international institutions that may have their own strong feelings about what constitutes good corporate governance,” Dimon wrote in his 2023 annual letter to shareholders. A spokesperson for ISS said in a statement that the company is aware of the executive order and will review it as it considers next steps: “ISS does not dictate or set corporate governance standards and remains firmly committed to operating professionally, ethically, independently, and in the best interests of our clients, as we have done historically.” A spokesperson for Glass Lewis said in a statement: “While we are still reviewing the full order, we appreciate the clarity it provides in understanding what the administration expects of all firms in the proxy advisory space. Glass Lewis has always operated with the highest ethical standards with our clients being at the center of everything we do.” Trump’s executive order highlights just how influential ISS and Glass Lewis have become, Lawrence Elbaum, an M&A partner at Sullivan & Cromwell and co-head of its shareholder activism defense practice, told CNN. “It’s on the heels of efforts by different states and other constituencies to try to curb ISS and Glass Lewis’ influence,” Elbaum said. “So I’m not surprised to see the executive order.” Attorneys from Sullivan & Cromwell are representing Trump in a New York criminal case. Elbaum is not affiliated with the legal defense. The proxy advisory firms have come under pressure in recent months. Florida’s attorney general, James Uthmeier, is suing ISS and Glass Lewis, alleging the companies are in violation of state antitrust laws. Trump’s executive order also directs the Federal Trade Commission to investigate whether ISS and Glass Lewis are in violation of antitrust laws. Still, Elbaum cautioned, until any government reviews are completed, it’s hard to know what exactly will happen to the advisory firms. “I would say this EO is an initial momentum toward a ‘win’ for Musk and Dimon, but ultimately we won’t know whether there’s been a ‘win’ until this plays out further as the government agencies do their work,” Elbaum said.
