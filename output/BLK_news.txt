While the crypto market’s broader bullish sentiment is being driven by the strong possibility of a Federal Reserve rate cut decision, the tokens' rise coincides with BlackRock’s plans to introduce exchange-traded funds onto public blockchains, Bloomberg reported Wednesday. Ondo is up nearly 10% on the day to $1.10 after clocking more than 21% gains this week, CoinGecko data shows. Thursday's gains follow last week's launch of tokenized versions of more than 100 U.S.-listed stocks, ETFs, and other equities on Ethereum via the DeFi protocol's Global Markets platform. Lai Yuen, investment analyst at Fischer8 Capital, told Decrypt Ondo’s price rise is likely driven by “excitement around tokenized stocks.” Onboarded partners and advisors for Ondo’s Global Markets, which includes the likes of WisdomTree, have helped grow the platform by $160 million in TVL over nine days. That all but “underscores the project’s strong early traction,” Yuen said. Ondo Finance's total value locked, meanwhile, has nearly tripled since the start of 2025, growing from $611 million to $1.57 billion, DefiLlama data shows. The long-term outlook remains bullish, according to Yuen, who posits that even if the project captures 10% of the stock market, it would translate to “substantial fee generation for Ondo token holders.” “The project’s regulatory moat, bolstered by its advisory board, provides a durable long-term advantage that will be difficult for competitors to replicate,” he said.

Title: Trailblazer Tania Rosser brings a different school of thought to Gonzaga head coach role

It’s a Thursday afternoon, Tania Rosser is on her way to Gonzaga College in Ranelagh, south Dublin, to take training for the senior cycle rugby players. First though, before they hit the pitches, about 50 of those pupils will do yoga, an innovation she has introduced since taking the position of head coach to the Senior Cup team during the summer. It’s a statement appointment, and not in a headline-courting manner. In coming through an interview process conducted by principal Damien McCaul and vice principal Stephen Carey, she wasn’t just the best woman for the position – she was the preferred and best applicant. The New Zealand native, who arrived in Ireland 23 years ago, played international rugby across three different codes – touch, sevens and XVs. She won 58 caps for Ireland and participated in three World Cups, during the last of which she came out of retirement to help orchestrate Ireland’s victory over New Zealand in 2014. Rosser was a player-coach at DLSP and Blackrock College, coached J1 (seconds) men’s team and did skills work with the AIL squad in Clontarf. She coached the women’s team in Old Belvedere and several of the Irish touch rugby international teams before leading the Leinster women to back-to-back interprovincial titles during a three-year tenure that started in 2021. Her passion for rugby stems from childhood. The youngest of five siblings to Denis and Nancy, she grew up on a “massive farm” in Hawke’s Bay before the family subsequently moved into the town of Hastings when she was a little older. Brothers Ray and Dan were sent to boarding school and the only time she got to see them was at rugby matches on weekends. Rosser admits to being the tiresome little sister, a shadow for her brothers who were eight and 10 years older. She wanted to play rugby but her parents forbade it, directing her towards netball and basketball, at which she excelled. She used to sneak out to play rugby until she was caught and grounded. That rebellious streak – the refusal to have other people define her boundaries – has travelled with her in life. She badgered her father to set up a touch rugby footie team, to legitimise her participation. The first time her parents saw her play rugby was for Ireland in a 43-0 defeat to France at the 2006 World Cup in Edmonton, Canada. She wanted to be a police officer but qualified as a primary schoolteacher at the behest of her mother, who thought the former occupation was too dangerous. She then moved to Ireland with her husband Simon Broughton, who had received a rugby-playing offer from Ballymena in the All-Ireland League. It was supposed to be two years but relocating to Dublin changed the plan. Simon – now the Leinster Academy manager – played with DLSP and Leinster, as did Tania. Her first coach at the Kilternan club was George Hook. During Covid she enrolled in a high-performance coaching course with World Rugby. Former England and Australia backs coach Scott Wisemantel was one of the mentors, while she got to do online workshops with former Ireland coach Eddie O’Sullivan and New Zealand mental skills guru Gilbert Enoka. When her three years at Leinster finished, she was on the lookout for another challenge and decided to pursue the position at Gonzaga. Long-time Senior Cup team (SCT) coach Declan Fassbender, who led his alma mater to three Senior Cup finals including a first ever success in 2023, vacated the role to concentrate on coaching Lansdowne. So why Gonzaga? “I just decided to throw my name in, send in my CV in and see what would come of it. “I (was) really disappointed that I couldn’t keep going with Leinster. So, I was looking for a new challenge and thought why not apply? I got the interview, went in and met the principal and deputy principal and had an honest conversation. They seemed open to it.” She’s not the first woman to be involved in coaching an SCT team, even in Ranelagh. Sandford Park school, a middling punt from the entrance to Gonzaga, had former New Zealand sevens and rugby league international Mere Baker – she also worked with the Railway Union club at the time – as part of their senior coaching team in the early to mid-2010s. Rosser started working with her new charges during the summer. “The boys started doing strength and conditioning in July, about 40 kids. I thought it would be a good idea to go in, sit with them, meet them one-on-one, find out what’s driving them, what they like about rugby, what they don’t like about rugby, just asking them a bit about themselves. “And just having that opportunity to say to them, look, my job is to make sure that they’re okay as people first. If they’re not well, or if they’re struggling in school or something, it’s okay – just come and tell me before training, and then we know that you’re off. “Sometimes when these players turn up, we don’t know what’s happening at home or at school, or if they’ve had a hard day. And a lot of times these kids don’t get to say it because they’re too afraid. It’s taken the boys a while to warm to being open with their feelings but there has been a little purchase of late.” Rosser’s principles in coaching young people is refreshing. “My whole thing is, there has to be life after this (schools rugby) for them. Too many kids don’t go on and play club rugby after the Senior Cup because they’re beaten up or broken, or they haven’t enjoyed it. “So how can I keep them, give them longevity, because there’s a long journey in their life and rugby career, if they continue to play club rugby. It’s just a holistic approach. It’s probably very different from other Senior Cup teams and I’m okay with it. I’m okay with people going ‘she’s mad’ or ‘this is ridiculous’. “I don’t care what people think outside the programme or the environment. I look at doing things differently – bringing in yoga, making the boys bring recovery food to every single session before they get on the pitch, checking in with them. “I like using different approaches. I shared with them my journey growing up, you know, facing racism (her mum is Maori), and being on an isolated farm, so they got a sense of who I was. The most important thing I said, the first thing is, I’m a mum. “By the time we get through this campaign, you’ll be like my kid. If you need me, if you give me all you can, I’ll always have your back, on and off the pitch. It’s just how I am with players.” Rosser looks to empower them on the pitch too. Her coaching operandi is inclusive rather than despotic. She’s had conversations with the boys, teasing out options for the game plan on the basis that if they don’t work, they can be discarded. It’s an interaction that wouldn’t be commonplace. At home there is a fair amount of rugby talk with Simon as Leinster academy manager and her son Serge, a pupil at St Andrew’s College and part of the Leinster Under-19s squad. He’s a scrumhalf, like mum, “only better”, in her words. He’s named after the great French fullback Serge Blanco, whom both his parents loved as a player. Serge was very nearly called Fionn. Tania couldn’t pronounce the name adequately with her Kiwi accent, so her then-Ireland rugby teammates advised her not to go there. She’s never been cowed by how others perceive her and is excited for what lies ahead. Rosser doesn’t look at glass ceilings, she just does what she has to do because it never occurred to her not to. She has encountered misogyny, asked whether she was the physio or the manager, but it doesn’t ruffle her savoir-faire. In the past, she’s noticed that “between a male counterpart in my role and myself, I’d say that the male counterpart gets things a lot easier than I would”. She added: “And I’m okay with that. I’m okay with working to try and break down barriers. I’ll push the boundaries as far as I can, ask questions and try to make things better for our set-up.” The Gonzaga boys will be the latest beneficiaries of that mindset. From her childhood days, she’s had to persuade people to give her an opportunity and that she’d take care of the rest. The level of success that ensued speaks for itself. A trailblazer and a woman for others, to tweak the Jesuit mantra. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Avalanche Targets $1 Billion Fundraising Goal For Two AVAX Treasuries

Time Published: 2025-09-12T04:00:01Z

The Avalanche Foundation, a non-profit organization that supports the Avalanche (AVAX) blockchain ecosystem, is reportedly seeking to raise $1 billion through a major fundraising campaign to create two AVAX treasuries. This initiative aligns with a broader trend in the cryptocurrency space, where various organizations and traditional finance firms are experimenting with crypto treasury models to strengthen their financial stability and operational capabilities. According to the Financial Times, the Avalanche Foundation is in advanced talks to create two crypto treasuries in the United States. These moves come at a time when the foundation is gaining traction among institutional investors, with firms like BlackRock and Visa already utilizing the Avalanche blockchain for their operations. The foundation’s strategy involves launching one digital asset treasury company while converting an existing firm into a treasury vehicle. The goal is to secure approximately $1 billion, with the expectation to finalize these deals within weeks. The funds raised are earmarked for the acquisition of millions of AVAX tokens, which will be offered at a discounted price directly from the Avalanche Foundation. This approach is aimed to not only support the foundation’s growth but also to enhance the liquidity and market presence of AVAX amid an increasingly competitive treasury companies landscape. Per the report, the first fundraising deal aims to secure up to $500 million through a private investment led by Hivemind Capital, with expectations to finalize the agreement by the end of the month. Notably, Anthony Scaramucci, a crypto investor and former White House press secretary, is advising on this initiative. The second funding endeavor involves a special purpose acquisition vehicle (SPAC) sponsored by Dragonfly Capital, which is also targeting a $500 million raise. This deal may take longer to conclude, potentially stretching into October. Both initiatives will focus on purchasing discounted AVAX tokens held by the Avalanche Foundation, which has a total supply of 720 million tokens, with approximately 420 million currently circulating. The broader cryptocurrency market has seen a surge in fundraising activities this year. Companies have raised over $16 billion to stockpile crypto assets, often inspired by the successful Bitcoin (BTC) treasury model of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy). Tokens associated with other blockchains, such as Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), have also seen significant price increases. These tokens were selected by major publicly traded companies in the US for their respective crypto-focused treasuries. Although AVAX has not experienced the same upward momentum, CoinGecko data shows that it has recorded gains of up to 17% in the weekly time frame. As of this writing, the AVAX price is approaching the key $30 mark, a level not seen since February of this year.

Valuations remain neutral, and our models indicate that the economy has entered a risk-recovery cycle. Having deployed ~15% cash and moderately raised portfolio beta, we believe the major overhang from tariff uncertainty and FII selling is largely behind us. Strong domestic macros—robust GDP growth, GST reforms, tax and rate cuts, low inflation, healthy liquidity, supportive DXY and bond yields, alongside peaked-out downgrades and mutual fund cash levels at 5–6%—all point to a firm base for Indian equities. While global risks persist, the improving US-India dialogue, stable domestic inflows, and improving factor spreads set the stage for a broad-based recovery over the next 12–18 months*. This makes it an opportune time to shift from a defensive to a moderately aggressive stance. Given the low factor spread regime, we are running a balanced multi-factor profile, unlike in the past when we adopted larger style tilts. Large- and mid-caps remain our core focus at ~80% allocation (40% each), with small-caps kept below 20%. Sectorally, our overweight remains in Materials and Financials, supported by selective exposure to Consumption (Discretionary), Industrials, Autos, and Healthcare.

More Info Investors in Saudi Aramco’s Jafurah natural gas project have approached a group of lenders to secure $10.3 billion in funding for the project. Jafurah is at the center of Saudi Arabia’s plans to develop its natural gas resources, diversifying from crude oil. With a price tag of a total $100 billion, the Jafurah development is described as the largest unconventional gas development outside the United States. Its reserves are estimated at some 229 trillion cu ft of natural gas plus 75 billion barrels of condensate. Production has been scheduled to start in the current quarter. According to Reuters, BlackRock, via Global Infrastructure Partners, is in talks with potential lenders interested in funding the project. These include JP Morgan and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, unnamed sources in the know told the publication. The source said BlackRock will contribute $1.8 billion of its own money to the total. According to Bloomberg, which also cited unnamed sources, the funding has already been secured. Per the Bloomberg sources, the funding package consists of a seven-year loan that could be refinanced on the bond market and a 19-year loan facility. In addition to the abovementioned banks, the banks involved in the loans also include Citi, Mitsubishi UFJ, and Mizuho. The news of the loan deal comes a month after Aramco sealed a deal with Blackrock’s Global Infrastructure Partners to invest $11 billion in a lease deal for Jafurah. Under the agreement, the BlackRock-led group will lease midstream facilities that serve Jafurah and then lease them back to Aramco for 20 years. The two set up a subsidiary company to manage the midstream facilities that BlackRock will lease, in which Aramco got 51% and BlackRock got 49%. Earlier in the year, Aramco also announced the signing of a slew of contracts for the Phase 2 development of Jafurah. The contracts’ total value was $12.4 billion, to involve the construction of gas compression facilities and associated pipelines, expansion of the Jafurah Gas Plant—including the construction of gas processing trains—and utilities, sulfur, and export facilities. Another $8.8 billion worth of contractual work was awarded to companies that will expand the project’s Master Gas System to boost its total capacity by an additional 3.15 billion standard cubic feet per day by 2028 through the installation of around 4,000 km (2,485 miles) of pipelines and 17 new gas compression trains. The billions have been piling up as Aramco moves the project closer to commercial production. While not known for being stingy, Saudi Arabia has clearly made a priority of developing its natural gas reserves and not a moment too soon, either. Despite attempts by the climate change activist lobby to discourage natural gas use due to emissions—natural gas demand has been on a strong and steady rise. The latest driver of this demand, of course, is the artificial intelligence race between IT giants that everyone in forecasting expects will fuel a veritable surge in electricity demand. Just this week, the Energy Information Administration reiterated its prediction that electricity consumption in the United States this year and next will hit a record high. America’s power use will hit 4,187 billion kilowatt-hours in 2025 and then rise to 4,305 billion kWh in 2026, according to the latest edition of the EIA’s Short-Term Energy Outlook. The previous record of 4,097 billion kWh was set in 2024. Gas demand is rising globally, too, opening up a growing market to Aramco, which plans to ramp up the country’s natural gas production by as much as 60% by 2030 from 2021 levels, when gas production stood at 10.1 billion cu ft, according to Aramco.

Title: LNG carbon bomb tops Carney’s list of major projects

Time Published: 2025-09-11T22:17:15Z

Prime Minister Mark Carney hammers a few nails at a carpentry school before announcing five major projects as part of his plan for Canada to navigate changing trade relationships in Edmonton on Thursday September 11, 2025. Photo by: Amber Bracken / The Canadian Press A major carbon bomb sits atop Prime Minister Mark Carney’s first tranche of major projects, sparking backlash from environmental and Indigenous communities who say that doubling down on liquified natural gas is placing a dangerous bet on Canada’s future. The LNG Canada terminal in Kitimat, BC, is the primary way to export liquified natural gas (LNG) from the Montney Play. This region of British Columbia and Alberta is home to gas fields that, if fully tapped, would surpass Canada’s 2030 emissions targets 30 times over. It is a globally recognized “carbon bomb,” and LNG Canada Phase 2 — that doubles capacity at the site, making it the second largest facility of its kind in the world — was announced Thursday as a priority for Ottawa. The remaining projects include: The Darlington New Nuclear project in Ontario; The Port of Montreal’s Contrecœur terminal expansion in Quebec; McIlvenna Bay Foran Copper Mine project in Saskatchewan; Red Chris Mine expansion project in BC. Thursday’s announcement is a major step on a central campaign promise made by Carney to rapidly build major infrastructure. Speaking in Edmonton, he said the first batch of major projects would add $60 billion to the country’s economy. “For too long, when federal agencies have examined a project, their immediate question has been, ‘Why?’” Carney said. “From now on, Canada's new government starts by asking ourselves for major projects: How? How can we do it bigger? How can we do it faster?” Carney did not say how much federal financial support the companies building these projects would receive, but acknowledged projects would likely get some federal funding. Regardless, even by sending them to the newly launched Major Projects Office to help coordinate financing, public resources are being spent to push these projects over the finish line. The five projects Carney will now send to the Major Projects Office for review were already well under development, with some scheduled to begin operations next year. He acknowledged as much, noting that the first tranche of projects are owned by proponents who “have already done much of the hard work,” and “already meet many of the necessary regulatory standards.” In fact, government sources earlier told Canada’s National Observer that having the project already underway was one of two basic criteria used to choose the first round, making it easier for Ottawa to score political points for successfully completing it. The other was that the project is considered “stuck” in the regulatory process. “I'm not at all surprised they would pick projects that are already in the system,” said Martin Olszynski, an associate professor and chair of energy, resources and sustainability at the University of Calgary. “The idea is they'll be hustled the rest of the way.” At an estimated cost of $25 billion, LNG Canada Phase 2 is the largest in the first round of major projects. Environmental advocates and Indigenous leaders, key constituents and rights-holders who Carney has promised to respect, were quick to condemn it. Grand Chief Stewart Phillip, Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs president, said in a statement he was “gravely concerned” that the federal government is “deliberately” sidestepping its duty to consult First Nations. “Rather than being met with partnership, we are given an ultimatum: accept fossil fuel expansion or be pushed aside,” he said. “LNG Canada is not only a massive source of greenhouse gas emissions, but also drives destructive fracking, further threatening our lands, waters and communities — emissions do not recognize territorial boundaries. “We reject any process that tramples our inherent and constitutionally protected title and rights, ignores free, prior and informed consent, and sacrifices the climate for foreign corporate profits,” he added. LNG Canada’s owners are Shell, Mitsubishi, the Korea Gas Corporation, Petronas and PetroChina. An analysis from TD described Carney’s inclusion of LNG Canada Phase 2 as “superficial support,” because whether or not the project actually goes ahead depends on its owners. The bank said it would have liked to have seen the Ksi Lisims LNG and related Prince Rupert Gas Transmission Pipeline projects included to indicate federal support for the LNG sector. An analysis from Clean Energy Canada, published last year, estimates the greenhouse gas emissions from the already operating LNG Canada site are economically devastating. Doubling the export terminals capacity dramatically increases that harm. Specifically, the think tank found that the annual social cost of carbon — a widely used metric to approximate economic damages (such as health care costs) per tonne of greenhouse gas emissions — estimates $11.1 billion in damages by 2030 and annual costs of $14.8 billion by 2050. If Phase 2 were built, by 2050 the annual social cost of carbon emissions from the LNG Canada site soars to $29.6 billion. Over the project’s decades-long lifecycle, both phases of the project amount to nearly $1 trillion in damages — a supreme liability hanging over the country’s head, following the International Court of Justice’s finding this summer that countries could be held responsible for knowingly committing climate harm. Beyond its climate harm, forecasts suggest a global supply glut of LNG is looming, making new investments economically risky. “It's not in our national interest to increase our carbon emissions when we've had devastating fires year after year,” said Richard Brooks, climate finance director with Stand.earth. “They're exactly the opposite of what we should be doing.” Olszynski said he understands why many will be upset about LNG Canada Phase 2’s inclusion, but given the economic system we have, it’s not surprising to see it included. Even if risking “white elephants” — a term for major stranded assets — if banks are willing to invest, projects are likely to see those investment dollars flow. “There's the world that we want, and the world as it is,” he said. There’s a constant tension in market-based economies between planning for the future and market forces looking to profit in the short term. “There will always be forces pushing for more planning [and] for more logic, and then there will be those who push very strongly against them, and say that is contrary to market principles where the market will decide, that markets are efficient, and that markets will figure this out.” “(Former prime minister) Trudeau probably was prepared to tip the scales more towards planning [than] the current prime minister,” he said. Given the trade threats from the United States and push to diversify Canada’s trading partners, alongside the state of the Canadian economy as is, Carney “is saying I can't keep pissing those guys off — the folks who control the purse strings.” The Darlington nuclear project is a multi-billion dollar investment in small modular reactors. Once in operation, Carney said it would drive $500 million annually into Ontario’s nuclear supply chain and provide enough electricity to power 1.2 million homes. Ontario Power Generation was granted a licence earlier this year to begin construction. The two mining projects in the first tranche, the McIlvenna Bay copper mine in Saskatchewan and the Red Chris copper and gold mine in northwestern BC, Carney said would strengthen Canada’s position in the global critical minerals trade. The Red Chris copper mine, owned by Colorado-headquartered Newmont — whose majority shareholders include powerful US financial firms Vanguard Group, BlackRock, State Street and Van Eck Associates — has been fought by conservation groups and First Nations warning of risks to the environment. In a letter filed with the BC government, the SkeenaWild Conservation Trust warns the planned expansion will lead to sulphate, copper and selenium concentrations “exceeding” BC water quality guidelines. Similarly, a letter from the Central Council of the Tlingit & Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska says “we are alarmed by reports of ongoing seepage at the Red Chris site and the failure to contain contaminated surface waters.” “This is an urgent matter that demands enforcement action — not expansion,” the letter adds. Foran Mining Corporation — whose major shareholders include US-based Agnico Eagle Mines, Toronto-headquartered Fairfax Financial and the Public Sector Pension Investment Board — is developing the McIlvenna Bay Copper Mine in Saskatchewan. In recent years, the project has been protested by members of the Peter Ballantyne Cree Nation. The mining project threatens at-risk woodland caribou and 13 hectares of muskeg — valuable peatlands that absorb carbon dioxide from the air. Carney had previously teased that the Contrecœur expansion project at the Port of Montreal would make his list of major projects. The expansion, fought by environmentalists due to its impact on critical habitats for fish and frogs, involves a new container terminal to handle an additional 1.1 million containers per year, and was already planned and receiving cash from Quebec. It is scheduled to begin operations in 2029. Earlier this year, Xavier Barsalou-Duval, transportation, infrastructure and communities critic with the Bloc Québécois called on Carney to not include it as a project in the national interest. “A project of this magnitude should only proceed if it can be demonstrated that it can be carried out in strict compliance with existing environmental standards,” he said. “This burden, which falls to the Port of Montreal, must not be shirked or truncated by the Liberal government.” Carney said several other major projects are far from being ready, but are worth considering. He is asking the Major Projects Office to create business development teams to help advance them. The Major Projects Office will consider regulations, financing and supply chains for critical minerals, including in the priority areas of Ontario’s Ring of Fire, the Slave Geological Area in the Northwest Territories and in the Labrador Trough overlapping Québec and Labrador. The office will also study large-scale clean power with a focus on Nova Scotia’s proposed Wind West project. Carney said the offshore wind megaproject could generate one quarter of Canada’s entire electricity demand, and should be studied in tandem with the Energy East Partnership (a proposal to strengthen Atlantic Canada’s power grids) and the development of Gull Island being pursued by Québec and Newfoundland and Labrador. An “Arctic Economic and Security Corridor” will also be pursued, Carney said. The project would be anchored by a new port at Grays Bay in Nunavut, and include new roads and military capabilities. Upgrading the Port of Churchill will also be considered with plans to increase port capacity, rail lines, marine ice-breaking capabilities and an “energy corridor” to be studied, he said. The project would be developed with Manitoba’s Crown-Indigenous Corporation. Delivering on high-speed rail between Quebec City and Toronto is also a goal the Major Projects Office will study, with plans to be put in place within four years. Carney said the Major Projects Office will also help develop a “Canadian Sovereign Cloud,” to build computing capacity and data centres he framed as essential to economic competitiveness with artificial intelligence and quantum computing. The last major initiative the Major Projects Office will study promises to be controversial. The Pathways Alliance’s $16.5-billion proposal to pipe carbon dioxide captured from oilsands sites in northern Alberta to an underground storage site south of Cold Lake, will be considered. Carney dubbed the project “Pathways Plus” — with the plus being the possibility of a new oil pipeline being built, if the carbon capture megaproject is built. He framed the possibility as a way to strike a grand bargain as Alberta Premier Danielle Smith has called for, that could see “decarbonized oil” flow to new markets. As previously reported by Canada’s National Observer, “decarbonized oil” is not a credible term, leading climate scientists say. Carney said a second tranche of major projects to be referred to the Major Projects Office would be announced by Nov. 16. Geoffrey Pounder | September 11th 2025, 04:37 pm Carney: “For too long, when federal agencies have examined a project, their immediate question has been, ‘Why?’ From now on, Canada's new government starts by asking ourselves for major projects: How? How can we do it bigger? How can we do it faster?” Yes, let's not ask ourselves why or if we should build a project. Let's not ask ourselves whether a project is worth doing. Let's not conduct a cost-benefit analysis. Let's not identify and quantify the impacts of projects, singly and cumulatively. Let's just do it. Let's just go straight to figuring out how to build projects. Bigger and faster. In what world does that strategy make a lick of sense? In what world does failure to plan not lead to disaster? Cost overruns, delays, bad design, unforeseen consequences, not to mention local opposition? How is this good government? Geoffrey Pounder | September 11th 2025, 04:39 pm Article: "Environmental advocates and Indigenous leaders, key constituents and rights-holders who Carney has promised to respect, were quick to condemn it." Our trusty reporter fails to mention the not inconsiderable indigenous support for LNG: - Haisla Nation: A majority owner of the Cedar LNG project, partnering with Pembina Pipeline Corporation. - Nisg̱a'a Nation: A joint venture partner in the Ksi Lisims LNG project. - Gitxaala, Kitselas, Yekooche, and Stellat'en First Nations have signed benefits agreements related to LNG development. - Gitxsan Nation: Supports the natural gas pipeline that would supply the Ksi Lisims LNG project. Some indigenous communities see fossil-fuel "development" as their path out of decades of poverty. To what extent indigenous support is coerced is another question. If they do not have the right to say NO, their YES does not mean much. Alex Botta | September 12th 2025, 01:07 pm In reply to Article: "Environmental… by Geoffrey Pounder Yes, there is Indigenous support for LNG. There are are also Indigenous opponents, and that has caused a division among and within First Nations. Those who have an equity stake will enjoy significant revenue up to what ever ceiling evolves, perhaps less than the original hype due to cost overruns during the construction of supply infrastructure meeting a supply glut and undercutting international competition. Or perhaps a longer run of returns into the mid-2030s out to 2040 where a peak in demand is looming. Either way, support among BC's First Nations for LNG, as mixed as it is, will never in a million years be reflected in another Northern Gateway pipeline proposal carrying diluted bitumen. Roy Brander | September 12th 2025, 09:08 am It's a mistake to think Carney has that much agency. His votes were a frankly unnatural reverse of what was going to happen, last election. It could flip back any time if he is seen as "weak". (Biden didn't fall because he sounded senile; Trump has sounded senile for years. Biden's sin was to appear weak.) The (insane, but real) prevailing belief is that traditional solutions are "strong" and new, untried technologies are "weak". Those who remember PCs vs Mainframes in 1980s corporations recall when that was the dynamic for IT. The LNG expansion is the hardest proposal to fight, because it leverages the sunk cost of the existing plant, the site and the foundations and pipes and powerlines to it. It's the smallest concession he could make, frankly. And climate activists should have a little confidence that the new technologies are not weak, and that their strength will be quite obvious to all, not just to experts, in five more years. By the time this expansion is built, there will be no calls for more. Tris Pargeter | September 12th 2025, 11:07 am Martin Olszynski is right; he sees the POLITICAL realities that unfortunately but absolutely NECESSARILY preclude the full-scale climate change action required, a situation that is also very much mirrored in Europe right now, making Carney's unprecedented effort to turn away from the States and toward the EU the most important message. Ultimately, that involves OUR economy as it IS, banks and big corporations very much included, unfortunately. So for all the purists and activists who are currently threatening what political capital progressives currently HAVE, barely but most fortuitously wrested away from the cons, again I point out that you are ALL becoming part of the problem, heroic though you claim to be. For many of you, I quote Falstaff who said "honor is a mere scutcheon," and for many more I'd say wake up and smell the coffee because this is as good as it gets UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, which we ALL are, always. The Liberals are also forming an environmental caucus for us all, proof of why they are the only rational choice and we're lucky to have them AND Carney, period. He summed up the situation recently when a reporter questioned his choice of an adviser who was involved with the tobacco industry by pointing out that last time he checked that although he doesn't approve of any of it, there IS a tobacco industry and it is NOT illegal to smoke. The same can unfortunately still be said for the fossil fuel industry, but people still need to heat their homes and drive their cars to work. Because the stakes are much higher, in fact couldn't be higher, all the more reason we need unusually adroit leadership, which we fortunately HAVE. Paul Berger | September 12th 2025, 09:13 pm In reply to Martin Olszynski is right;… by Tris Pargeter Causing the immense suffering of others may be slightly better than causing very immense suffering, but that's a very low bar. We would be fortunate if the Liberals had been climate leaders in any real sense in the last decade. No matter what Carney does, he's already lost in sending the message, consistent with JT, that we're not in a climate emergency. For shame.

Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock explores tokenizing exchange-traded fund (ETF) shares as part of its push to expand its digital asset infrastructure beyond traditional market boundaries. As Bloomberg News reported on Sept. 11, the firm weighs creating blockchain-based versions of ETFs tied to real-world assets (RWA), including stocks, according to sources familiar with the confidential planning. The initiative builds on BlackRock’s $2.2 billion BUIDL tokenized money-market fund, launched in March 2024, two months after the debut of its Bitcoin ETF. CEO Larry Fink previously stated that every financial asset can be tokenized, most recently reiterating it in his 2025 annual letter to investors. Tokenized ETF shares would enable trading beyond Wall Street’s standard hours, improve international access to US products, and create new collateral opportunities within crypto networks. The report comes in the same week as Nasdaq filed with the SEC to trade tokenized stocks and ETFs on its platform. BlackRock has tested tokenized fund shares through JPMorgan’s Kinexys infrastructure and positioned itself as an early adopter of digital settlement models.

Excluding private credit, tokenized money funds are the largest RWA category, with a $7.4 billion market cap as of Sept. 11. At the same time, ETFs offer broader asset exposure and trading mechanics that are well-suited for blockchain deployment. Exchanges including Kraken, Robinhood, and Coinbase already offer tokenized stocks internationally or plan to do so. However, the report noted that current challenges include reconciling ETF settlement through Wall Street clearinghouses with blockchain’s instant, 24-hour trading capabilities. These challenges create technical and regulatory questions for custodians managing the transition between traditional and digital infrastructure. BlackRock’s exploration reflects mainstream finance’s evaluation of blockchain technology for enhancing market infrastructure, including improvements in collateral flows and settlement speed. The firm’s digital asset advocacy, combined with regulatory shifts, positions tokenized ETFs as another bridge between traditional and decentralized finance systems.

BlackRock is exploring how to bring exchange-traded funds (ETFs) onto public blockchains, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. The sources said the asset manager is weighing tokenizing funds tied to real-world assets such as stocks, though any rollout would depend on regulatory approval. The discussions follow BlackRock’s first experiment with tokenization last year. The firm introduced the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, also known as BUIDL. The fund, which is backed by short-term U.S. Treasuries, repurchase agreements and cash, has quickly grown into the world’s largest tokenized Treasury product, managing nearly $2.2 billion. Tokenizing ETFs would represent a deeper step into blockchain-based financial products. In practice, it would mean that shares of the funds — traditionally traded on stock exchanges during market hours — could be issued and transacted as tokens on chain. Proponents argue this shift could bring clear benefits. A tokenized ETF could be traded around the clock, rather than only during exchange hours. Settlement, which often takes two business days in traditional finance, could be completed within minutes. Investors in markets where ETFs are not easily accessible might gain exposure through blockchain rails. The products are pending a green light from regulators, the people said. BlackRock’s exploration underscores a wider trend across finance, as banks, fintechs and asset managers test blockchain rails for bonds, private credit and now mainstream equity funds.

Title: If There Is No Welfare State, What Will Europe’s Social Contract Be?

The underlying social contract between individuals and the state in Western European nations over the last hundred years has been that the state would grow to regulate and tax virtually every sphere of life—public or private—in exchange for a measure of order and comfort for its citizens. If the state begins to reduce those comforts as order starts disintegrating, but continues to grow and to tax even more, it could be interpreted as a breach of the terms of the agreement. As I was finishing this article, France’s youngest citizens took to the streets to defend the welfare state under the banner of the “Block Everything” movement. Their demands include greater investment in public health and education, rent controls, retirement at 60, and stronger environmental policies. Protesters have erected barricades, blocked highways and public-transport stations, in an effort to bring the country to a standstill. More than 400 people were arrested. The demonstrations erupted after President Macron appointed Sébastien Lecornu as prime minister, a move widely seen as signaling the continuation of his predecessor’s austerity policies. These protests underscore the central argument of this article: the welfare state is the social contract that binds Western European citizens to their governments. When those benefits are eroded, many view it as a breach of that contract—one that, in their eyes, justifies civil disobedience. Friedrich Merz, often dubbed Germany’s “BlackRock” chancellor, has already indicated that there has to be a reduction in state benefits: “The welfare state as we know it today is no longer economically sustainable with what we are producing as a national economy.” That the welfare state suffers from a viability problem is not news. What is news is that the head of the largest economy in the eurozone, with a relatively low debt-to-GDP ratio (~65%), is publicly preparing citizens for a rollback of state benefits. But Germany is not alone in this conundrum. France’s government, the second-largest economy in the eurozone, with a much higher debt-to-GDP ratio (~119%), has lost a confidence vote in parliament and been dissolved over a budget that slashes public spending. According to deposed Prime Minister François Bayrou, nearly €44 billion in cuts is necessary because, he argues, France has not balanced its budget for roughly 50 years. The economy is expected to grow by no more than 0.6% in 2025, with a public deficit of about 6%. Some have even floated the prospect of an IMF bailout. Another European nation that might need an IMF bailout—perhaps even more urgently than France—is the UK. The UK’s debt is becoming significantly more expensive to service due to a sharp rise in borrowing costs, which now amount to over £100 billion annually—nearly 10% of the national budget. This comes despite decades of mass privatization of social services. According to many economists, both France and the UK are going downhill in slow motion toward a debt crisis. The Wall Street Journal, of course, has no doubt why this is happening: “Britain and France aren’t illiquid. They’re insolvent. Their future spending commitments, primarily in the form of expected social-welfare and old-age benefit payouts, far exceed any realistic estimate of the economic growth that will be available to pay those bills.” Other European nations, such as Spain—whose GDP is expected to grow around 2.5% in 2025—will face a very similar problem with their welfare systems. Spain’s debt-to-GDP ratio is around 100% (compared to Germany’s ~65%), but its share of the budget devoted to social services is almost identical. Spain’s current growth is predicated on a general increase in the money supply and a relatively successful immigration strategy over the last two decades. The immigrant population has gone from 3.5 million in 2005 to 7 million in 2025. This has contributed to lower GDP per capita, which is why many Spaniards have barely felt the macroeconomic growth. Despite immigration, the birth rate in Spain is among the lowest in Europe (1.12, lower than Germany, France, and the UK), which makes the long-term sustainability of the welfare state questionable under the logic that it is the current workforce that pays for it. The case for slashing public spending is usually the same: slower economic growth and a smaller workforce reduce the state’s revenues, while the aging population continues to grow and unemployment rises due to slower economic growth. This discourse presents budget cuts as almost inevitable and frames “slower economic growth” as a natural phenomenon, almost like a drought, occurring outside the control of politicians. That it is outside the control of politicians—who have limited control over financial policy—might be correct for the most part. However, to present it as a natural phenomenon implies assuming that markets operate under objective natural forces, like gravity, unaffected by the actors involved. That is simply not the case. The “markets” respond to the actions of individuals and companies. A case in point is the 2008 crash, which was brought about by a set of specific practices, such as the sale of mortgage derivatives, which were known—at least by some—to be fraudulent and to potentially cause the collapse of the entire system. The 2008 crisis is a good example because the financial crisis engineered by big financiers, with or without knowledge, was ultimately paid for by ordinary citizens, and virtually no one was held accountable. It will again be ordinary citizens who pay the price of the geopolitical crisis that now affects Europe with the war in Ukraine. The conflict has unleashed war momentum against the interests of most European citizens, both economically and existentially, which could have been avoided or at least settled early on. Its effects are now precipitating a collapse of European economies and societies. It is not that Europe did not have structural problems before—such as severe demographic decline, chronic underinvestment in digital technologies, a fiscal sustainability problem, or the loss of national sovereignty to an unelected bureaucratic class—but with the war in Ukraine, all these issues have become more pronounced. These problems have been compounded by the loss of cheap energy supplies from Russia—which were a lifeline to both industry and individuals—and the Trump administration’s demand that Europe foot the bill for the war in Ukraine and pay back the U.S. for years of supposedly favorable trade terms. While Merz warns Germans that they should be ready to see cuts in public spending, he continues to support Ukraine with €9 billion this year and has changed the country’s debt rules, which will skyrocket the debt-to-GDP ratio. According to a recent interview, he claimed that if he had not done so, the “NATO alliance would have disintegrated in June.” NATO member states, compelled at Trump’s behest to raise defense spending to 5% of GDP, will necessarily see cuts in public spending to offset this defense rise. Germany, France, and the UK are leading European support for Ukraine, promising to give Ukraine €100 billion to buy arms from the U.S. To this spending on Ukraine must be added the “Rearm Europe” plan, which, as Conor Gallagher very aptly argues, will result in armies ill-equipped to face Russia’s forces but well suited to face Europe’s own citizens: “Defense spending by EU member states is now projected to reach 381 billion euros this year, up over last year’s record of 343 billion. Despite all the money being burned at the altar of Project Ukraine, sober analysts conclude that European nations are woefully ill-equipped to successfully do much of any fighting there, and no amount of money is going to change that for the foreseeable future (…) But all the additional weaponry and surveillance goodies that aren’t immediately tossed into the corrupt pit of death that is Ukraine could be more likely to be used on an increasingly discontented population rather than against Russia. We’re already seeing it happen.” No wonder many Europeans are discontent when they are told that the basic underlying logic of their relationship with the state—the social contract embodied in the welfare state—has changed, yet they are unable to exit the contract. They are told there is no money for education, healthcare, or pensions, yet there appears to be an unending flow of money for weapons and war—a war that does not seem to be in the interests of most European citizens. The sovereignty of modern nation-states, which are paradigmatic European creations, rests on the assumption that the state embodies the “will of the people.” The somewhat abstract concept of “will to representation” is converted into “sovereign will” and vested in the “state.” This presupposes that the role of the state and the state bureaucracy is to safeguard the interests of its citizens. In Europe, the rise of the welfare state dates back to the end of the First World War. But it was really after the Second World War, in a Europe destroyed and impoverished, that the Western European states, with the help of the Marshall Plan, began developing a new social model. The war had left Europe ideologically and morally dead, so rather than ideals or morals, the state offered comfort and security in exchange for obedience and taxes. This model seemed to work and offered a compromise—a European way—between the capitalist model of the U.S. and the communist one of the Soviet Union. Although some of this is true, the success of the model was predicated on and expanded through the economic preeminence of Western Europe allied to the U.S.—some would say a vassal—especially after the fall of the Soviet Union. Parallel to, and as a consequence of, the rise of the welfare system was the growth of the state and the ever-increasing tax burden on its citizens. Starting in the 1960s, to finance the state, the value-added tax was implemented—first in France and later throughout Europe. The justification for this new tax was that the state needed the funds to finance welfare benefits. Europeans accepted this and other substantial tax increases, as well as sweeping new laws and regulations, afraid of returning to a pre-war scenario and comfortable with state benefits. So much so that, in Europe, “the state” has become almost synonymous with “the welfare state.” This logic—Europe’s underlying social contract—has held Western European society together. Though not without critique, it was widely accepted. When François Bayrou proposed the €44 billion cut to social services that ended his government, both the right and the left voted against it. In France, where society is currently extremely polarized, this is not a minor detail but a significant indicator. The protests that have erupted in defense of the welfare state—on which both left and right are trying to capitalize—are further proof. The current push for costly military readiness and arms spending seems to go against the logic of the welfare state, which is to say, against the interests of ordinary Europeans, thus changing the state’s side of the social contract. Now the state offers security and protection, not order and welfare, and asks more—not less—of citizens. That logic, in turn, requires new threats and enemies—and the launching of new wars. This happens because the state is, economically and ideologically, bankrupt. This is not an anomaly but a feature of this model of state sovereignty as now embodied in the European Union. If the state embodies the “will of the people,” then the goal of the state, conceived as an expression of sovereign will, has to be nothing more than its perpetual existence. “It is not an end among others; it is that end for which all others can be sacrificed,” writes Paul W. Kahn in Putting Liberalism in Its Place. Well with people like Kaja Kallas, they will go from fighting Russia to the last Ukrainian to fighting Russia to the last European. Seems like a natural progression. Those living in democratic Western nations have always had the opportunity to oppose military buildups in preparation for war with Russia. Yet, they chose not to. If they end up living in hunger and poverty, they will only have themselves to blame. >>>If they end up living in hunger and poverty, they will only have themselves to blame. Just like us Americans who despite keeping voting for change keep getting shafted by both the Democrats and the Republicans? I don’t know much about European politics, but I think that European politics, just like American politics, is rigged to favor the oligarchs and the politicians who serve them. Sadly, in the UK we have lived under an increasingly party-based authoritarian liberal oligarchy dressed with a rapidly fading and shrinking tinsel of electoral democracy wrapped around it. The BBC, funded by every license holder, lies, both by commission and omission, as does the MSM and the channels the MSM supports on Youtube, &c (no, the Times and Telegraph channels may sound like derivatives of ‘Round the Horne’ but, alas, they are not). The UK is not very different from other European countries which seem to be responding in similar ways by supporting new parties which wish to cast aside many of the constraints imposed by tradition and more recent custom and practice. We Brits have attempted to control HMG’s willingness to go down to defeat in wars the USA has embroiled us from Korea, by acts of civil disobedience and political demonstrations, through the Cruise missile crisis and the wonderful women of Greenham Common, the vicious war against civil rights activists in Ulster, the destruction of Serbia’s territorial integrity, the illegal invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, the overthrow and murder of Gadaffi and other leaders in North and sub-Saharan Africa, and the murderous regime put in place by the US and British Ukrainian coup and the subsequent conflict over Russian civil rights in the Donbass leading to the SMO. Sadly, none of our efforts worked. So the only option is to support completely new parties and to clean house even more thoroughly than Cromwell did. The real choice at the next election will be between Reform and Your Party. The same process is occurring or has occurred in countries on the European mainland and it looks as if many governments are more than prepared to go to war against their own people to maintain the privileges of the politcal and financial élite. The British have been prepared to give their lives for liberty in the past and will do so again. And this is true of every European nation. Our future is one of economic decline unless we come to terms with the emerging new world order and this pressure will only intensify the movement towards the most unLampedusa-like changes in the body politic. Is there any possibility that a potential future target of the new European militarism might be to the south of the continent, across the sea? A second prize of resources, if first prize (Russia) doesn’t pan out? European entities seem to devolve toward the principle of following the will of the right people. Elitism can take many forms, from directing the lower orders to getting exclusive access to perks. More transparency showing the hidden levers and accounts would be a start toward citizen understanding. Who pushes so hard for weaponry and war, and why? And how do a few individuals get to cause so many problems? Looking at BoJo, for one. Who wants country welfare programs to be overwhelmed by migrants, political, economic or otherwise? It looks like a real race to the end is looming in Europe. Who will be killed off first? The destructor propagators of mass death – Leyen Kallas Rutte Merz Macron Starmer et al Or millions of individuals among the people of Europe, some of whom are slowly coming to realise what trap is being set up for them. People in all of Europe – Germans, Spaniards, Serbs, Italians, Poles, Brits. Everyone. The financial data suggest the OK Coral is a low single digits of years away. Scary. The European welfare state, along with Social Security and other programs in the US, was created in part to keep those filthy commies at bay, not out of the goodness of the elite heart. Once there was no more USSR to worry about…. I don’t think it’s a coincidence the concrete material benefits for citizens have been on the decline while the wealth disparity has increased drastically for the last 40 years or so. Nazis, the West is fine with – many Western countries gladly invited them in after hostilities were over. It’s the sharing bit that just can’t be tolerated. This is simply not true about the experience of Western Europe. Most Western European states had some form of welfare system in place by the inter-war years not least because of trades union pressure and the need to support the dependents of the lost male population during the Great War. Bismark created the German welfare state as part of his effort to ensure the unification of Germany and to provide a secure basis for German industrial workers and soldiers – and it worked, and the rest of us followed in Germany’s wake. But something else happened during The Great War–something in Russia. Surely this had an effect on how European governments treated the working class. Then when that thing was finally defeated ideologically Thatcher could proclaim “there is no alternative.” Which is not to argue that political ideas control history but rather to agree with Stephen Douglas that “power concedes nothing without a demand.” The Russian Revolution was that demand scared the Euro aristocracy mightily. Some effect, maybe. The move towards the welfare state in Europe began before that, however (1880s in Germany, 1900s in Britain… I think most European countries started introducing key elements of modern welfare systems like old age pension schemes, somewhere in 1880-1910s; the only one I can find quickly that could conceivably be blamed on us is Italy, 1919 – there are many other examples outside of Europe, and there things may have been different). It was influenced in large part by domestic “demand”, or by the desire to stave off their own socialist and unionist movements, but there were other considerations as well: inter-European competition; wanting to keep the race in shape to keep down the colonial populations; even, though you may dismiss that, Christian paternalism, patriotism and/or social progressivism as elements of elite ideology and self-image. The Great October Socialist Revolution/October coup did influence later development to some extent, but it merely reinforced preexisting trends. I am not sure if its influence was always a helpful one for this, for that matter – it also helped start a powerful right-wing backlash that did not compare to what existed before the war. And I’d say it’s also an example of how ideas do control history – if people in and out of power had not conceived of such reforms, no one would have enacted them. The development of the welfare states of Europe can be traced well back to the mid-19th Century at least – they were arguably the result of the weakening of religion and the strengthening of the secular state, but you can trace its origins well back to medieval times – many towns and cities has surprisingly sophisticated social systems designed to protect the poorest organised by various forms of town governance (councils/guilds,etc). The motives were the usual complex mix of compassion, religious belief, social pressure, ideology and fear. They long predate any fear of socialism, although not of course fear of peasant uprisings. Later northern European welfare systems, developed as private companies became larger and more influential and developed their own health/welfare systems (often, of course, under trade union pressure), and these in time became generalised by the State in order to iron out social pressures between those protected by those corporate systems and those (not necessarily poor) on the outside. The complexity of the history is one reason why these systems are so complex (a health economist friend was fond of joking that there are only about 3 people alive who understand how the Dutch health system works) and have roots that go well beyond the notional ‘start’ of any particular scheme. Its also a key reason as to why there are so many deep differences between their design and implementation across Europe. Even between quite ‘similar’ countries – such as Denmark and Sweden – there are often very fundamental differences in both the background politics and the nuts and bolts of implementation of these systems. For the most part, they work surprisingly well, despite several decades of attacks by neoliberals (even Thatcher feared tackling the NHS). The key threat, as the article alludes – is that the pension/care systems are for the most part based on assumptions of rising population/economic growth which no longer hold. This is, in my opinion, a key reason why domestic politicians have been so reluctant to tackle immigration. The projections are horrible if you rely on domestic fertility – but this applies now all over the developed and intermediately developed world. Its a nettle that has yet to be firmly grasped by any country. Oh, of course – I specifically meant the comparatively standardised and systematic modern welfare systems as pioneered by Bismarck or Lloyd George, but depending on one’s definitions, some forms of state (or, more often, municipal?) welfare existed for centuries or indeed for as long as human civilisation. Standardised welfare of the Bismarck type is, to my knowledge, a 19th century European novelty; so is the ideologically-driven rejection of state welfare, though indeed, even such fanatics as Thatcher had a healthy fear of going too far in attacking what people had come to rely on. ” Stephen” Douglas? Surely you mean Frederick Douglas. Yes sorry for the senior moment. And to the other replies to my comment I’ll just point out that the Russian revolution was preceded by others in Europe and perhaps most importantly our own which rejected a king (coming soon as Ken Burns PBS doc). I think the statement made by Frederick Douglas is to the point and that point is that those at the pinnacle of power do not back down other than from the threat of violence since violence is how they maintain their position. Even in enlightened 19th century Britain (paging Dickens) you could still be drawn and quartered. Of course democracy is supposed to provide another path which is why they are doing so much to undermine it. There are a lot of problems here, and a lot of misguided prejudices (I am not refering to the article, but about common knowledge). Europe, except the USSR, the last European power, was done in 1945. It was pretty clear in the Suez crisis. Yes, they were important countries in a slow decline, but decline. EEC-EU-Europe, or Euroamerica, is a marginal side of the US hegemonic system. The EEC was a optimizing system for the main economies of Western Europe, it was never designed for advanced but small countries like Sweden, Switzerland or Austria, not at all for undeveloped like Greece, Spain, Portugal, let alone ex-COMECON and the lot, not even the fiasco of a United Germany. It became a chaos. It was a economic device, not even a political one, the Paris-Berlin axis was a mirage (because of German partition), it lasted until 1990s, UK was ever a disloyal member, and the like. The political device was, and is, NATO, all the powerful countries of the EU are nothing without it, and the traction of NATO was to make the EU as similar to the US as possible as fast as possible. The welfare state was a concession by fear of the Soviet Union, which exists no more. There is no reason not to carry the EU to the same social welfare standards of the US, which is what is happening. Corruption is massive, as ever was, so if we don’t see things from this point of view, we hardly understand anything. Taxes are lower than ever, in the sense that they are not extracting money where it is, in fact they collect less and less in a suicidal temptative to keep alive the system. If things were that far away without resistance, it’s more than dubious they are going to change in the next few years. Firstly, people must be aware about reality, not the bubble where they forced to live, and only after that, something could happen. Or not. All these comments are well and good, but of course, the interesting part is the question of what Putin’s motivations are. Is the attack on Poland because of internal failures in Russia, or are their other reasons? Putin obviously has his eyes on Latvia and Estonia, where a goodly portion of the population is Russian. One would have thought that they would be easier anti-Nato targets. There is obviously a ‘message’ here. Poland has historically been vulnerable because it is flat, and a convenient invasion corridor. Back in the day, when the European militaries worried about mass invasions by tanks, that made sense. Mutandis mutandi, it’s a drone’s world now. And it’s not like Israel, which gets its military weapons free, courtesy of ‘foreign aid’ from the US. Putin has to pay for all the Iranian drones and missles as well as domestic arms production. Has something changed internally that makes expansion of hostilities desirable? I’m sure the there’s ‘less here than meets the eye’, but being merely a slightly astute citizen myself, I can’t suss it out. Was there even an attack on Poland? Even that badic premise remains unclear. One might as well ask what the Poles were thinking at Gleiwitz, 1939. Ukraine did hack Russia drones, then send them through Belarus. Belarus even warned Poland about the drones. Fun fact. The drones that entered Poland did not have the range to reach there if launched from Russian positions. It was too far as the Russians pointed out. So either they were taken there by magical tailwinds that no weather report shows or else these were captured drones that were launched by Zelensky to bring Poland and NATO into the fighting. I’m going with Door Number Two. UK media has commented that they were launched from Belarus. Reports from Belarus said that they had a few enter their airspace which were shot down so gave Poland a heads up that they might have a few come their way. As for UK media, they are on par with Oz media or German media which is not a high bar. Some Brits say that the BBC actually stands for the British Bull******* Corporation as an example. Bad Old debating Technique- answering a question with a question. Maybe they were just playing questions- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3xIs0aajN4 “The underlying social contract between individuals and the state in Western European nations over the last hundred years has been that the state would grow to regulate and tax virtually every sphere of life—public or private—in exchange for a measure of order and comfort for its citizens…” Even though the final para states “This is not an anomaly but a feature of this model of state sovereignty as now embodied in the European Union. ..” the author doesn’t appear to acknowledge that the underlying European social contract between individuals and the nation state was effectively broken with the adoption of the financially unfederated Brussels governed administered common currency structure of European Union 26 yrs ago. The individual nation states in adopting the Euro surrendered their capacity to deliver on that social contract to unelected administrators in Brussels. Each Eurozone member state in abandoning their national currency, gave up their fiscal sovereignty to adopt the Euro – effectively a foreign issued currency. Together with accepting an arbitrarily Brussels enforced annual 3% fiscal deficit limit it was inevitable that expanded state monetary needs for industry/population growth would eat into the available funds necessary to deliver on that social contract. The US, itself a nation of 50 fully financially federated states, knew full well the implications of that structure – a stealthy ploy to slowly but surely destroy European socialism. IMHO a structure designed to keep Europe down, socially divided with vassalised financial elites in firm, ever growing control. An article worth re-reading (after 13 yrs) by Greg Palas is ‘Robert Mundell, evil genius of the euro.’ Any residual social contract in the UK was erased from 1980 when unemployment first hit 2m down to the Thatcherite dogma that unemployment was “a price worth paying”. The loss of trust in the political class during deindustrialisation, and social insecurity, has led to the rise of right wing populist insurgents preying on disaffection. Any of the European nations which has experienced youth unemployment over 20% and poor real wage increases over the last few decades is likely to have the same social insecurity. I agree. The state demands you obey the laws, keep the peace, respect your fellow citizens. In other words, to put the common good before your individual good. In return the state must give you the opportunity to thrive within those constraints. If it doesn’t all bets are off. “Another European nation that might need an IMF bailout—perhaps even more urgently than France—is the UK. The UK’s debt is becoming significantly more expensive to service due to a sharp rise in borrowing costs, which now amount to over £100 billion annually—nearly 10% of the national budget…” The UK does not need an IMF bailout – The UK is the sole fully sovereign issuer of the UK£. It can pay any debt it incurs denominated in the UK£. When will journalists ever spend the time researching how National monetary systems actually function? In a democracy with well informed citizens then the choice between having billionaires or having a social safety net would be easy. As is then I’d say that either the citizens aren’t well-informed and we have democracy or we don’t have democracy and what we do have is oligarchy. A subtle choice of words can be used when engaging in propaganda. The difference in outcome between asking if people want a welfare state or if they want a social safety net is (at least in my strong belief) huge. I believe that as long as the ‘opposition’ to the status quo are using phrases suggested by supporters of the status quo then the ‘opposition’ will not drive any change.

The underlying social contract between individuals and the state in Western European nations over the last hundred years has been that the state would grow to regulate and tax virtually every sphere of life—public or private—in exchange for a measure of order and comfort for its citizens. If the state begins to reduce those comforts as order starts disintegrating, but continues to grow and to tax even more, it could be interpreted as a breach of the terms of the agreement. As I was finishing this article, France’s youngest citizens took to the streets to defend the welfare state under the banner of the “Block Everything” movement. Their demands include greater investment in public health and education, rent controls, retirement at 60, and stronger environmental policies. Protesters have erected barricades, blocked highways and public-transport stations, in an effort to bring the country to a standstill. More than 400 people were arrested. The demonstrations erupted after President Macron appointed Sébastien Lecornu as prime minister, a move widely seen as signaling the continuation of his predecessor’s austerity policies. These protests underscore the central argument of this article: the welfare state is the social contract that binds Western European citizens to their governments. When those benefits are eroded, many view it as a breach of that contract—one that, in their eyes, justifies civil disobedience. Friedrich Merz, often dubbed Germany’s “BlackRock” chancellor, has already indicated that there has to be a reduction in state benefits: “The welfare state as we know it today is no longer economically sustainable with what we are producing as a national economy.” That the welfare state suffers from a viability problem is not news. What is news is that the head of the largest economy in the eurozone, with a relatively low debt-to-GDP ratio (~65%), is publicly preparing citizens for a rollback of state benefits. But Germany is not alone in this conundrum. France’s government, the second-largest economy in the eurozone, with a much higher debt-to-GDP ratio (~119%), has lost a confidence vote in parliament and been dissolved over a budget that slashes public spending. According to deposed Prime Minister François Bayrou, nearly €44 billion in cuts is necessary because, he argues, France has not balanced its budget for roughly 50 years. The economy is expected to grow by no more than 0.6% in 2025, with a public deficit of about 6%. Some have even floated the prospect of an IMF bailout. Another European nation that might need an IMF bailout—perhaps even more urgently than France—is the UK. The UK’s debt is becoming significantly more expensive to service due to a sharp rise in borrowing costs, which now amount to over £100 billion annually—nearly 10% of the national budget. This comes despite decades of mass privatization of social services. According to many economists, both France and the UK are going downhill in slow motion toward a debt crisis. The Wall Street Journal, of course, has no doubt why this is happening: “Britain and France aren’t illiquid. They’re insolvent. Their future spending commitments, primarily in the form of expected social-welfare and old-age benefit payouts, far exceed any realistic estimate of the economic growth that will be available to pay those bills.” Other European nations, such as Spain—whose GDP is expected to grow around 2.5% in 2025—will face a very similar problem with their welfare systems. Spain’s debt-to-GDP ratio is around 100% (compared to Germany’s ~65%), but its share of the budget devoted to social services is almost identical. Spain’s current growth is predicated on a general increase in the money supply and a relatively successful immigration strategy over the last two decades. The immigrant population has gone from 3.5 million in 2005 to 7 million in 2025. This has contributed to lower GDP per capita, which is why many Spaniards have barely felt the macroeconomic growth. Despite immigration, the birth rate in Spain is among the lowest in Europe (1.12, lower than Germany, France, and the UK), which makes the long-term sustainability of the welfare state questionable under the logic that it is the current workforce that pays for it. The case for slashing public spending is usually the same: slower economic growth and a smaller workforce reduce the state’s revenues, while the aging population continues to grow and unemployment rises due to slower economic growth. This discourse presents budget cuts as almost inevitable and frames “slower economic growth” as a natural phenomenon, almost like a drought, occurring outside the control of politicians. That it is outside the control of politicians—who have limited control over financial policy—might be correct for the most part. However, to present it as a natural phenomenon implies assuming that markets operate under objective natural forces, like gravity, unaffected by the actors involved. That is simply not the case. The “markets” respond to the actions of individuals and companies. A case in point is the 2008 crash, which was brought about by a set of specific practices, such as the sale of mortgage derivatives, which were known—at least by some—to be fraudulent and to potentially cause the collapse of the entire system. The 2008 crisis is a good example because the financial crisis engineered by big financiers, with or without knowledge, was ultimately paid for by ordinary citizens, and virtually no one was held accountable. It will again be ordinary citizens who pay the price of the geopolitical crisis that now affects Europe with the war in Ukraine. The conflict has unleashed war momentum against the interests of most European citizens, both economically and existentially, which could have been avoided or at least settled early on. Its effects are now precipitating a collapse of European economies and societies. It is not that Europe did not have structural problems before—such as severe demographic decline, chronic underinvestment in digital technologies, a fiscal sustainability problem, or the loss of national sovereignty to an unelected bureaucratic class—but with the war in Ukraine, all these issues have become more pronounced. These problems have been compounded by the loss of cheap energy supplies from Russia—which were a lifeline to both industry and individuals—and the Trump administration’s demand that Europe foot the bill for the war in Ukraine and pay back the U.S. for years of supposedly favorable trade terms. While Merz warns Germans that they should be ready to see cuts in public spending, he continues to support Ukraine with €9 billion this year and has changed the country’s debt rules, which will skyrocket the debt-to-GDP ratio. According to a recent interview, he claimed that if he had not done so, the “NATO alliance would have disintegrated in June.” NATO member states, compelled at Trump’s behest to raise defense spending to 5% of GDP, will necessarily see cuts in public spending to offset this defense rise. Germany, France, and the UK are leading European support for Ukraine, promising to give Ukraine €100 billion to buy arms from the U.S. To this spending on Ukraine must be added the “Rearm Europe” plan, which, as Conor Gallagher very aptly argues, will result in armies ill-equipped to face Russia’s forces but well suited to face Europe’s own citizens: “Defense spending by EU member states is now projected to reach 381 billion euros this year, up over last year’s record of 343 billion. Despite all the money being burned at the altar of Project Ukraine, sober analysts conclude that European nations are woefully ill-equipped to successfully do much of any fighting there, and no amount of money is going to change that for the foreseeable future (…) But all the additional weaponry and surveillance goodies that aren’t immediately tossed into the corrupt pit of death that is Ukraine could be more likely to be used on an increasingly discontented population rather than against Russia. We’re already seeing it happen.” No wonder many Europeans are discontent when they are told that the basic underlying logic of their relationship with the state—the social contract embodied in the welfare state—has changed, yet they are unable to exit the contract. They are told there is no money for education, healthcare, or pensions, yet there appears to be an unending flow of money for weapons and war—a war that does not seem to be in the interests of most European citizens. The sovereignty of modern nation-states, which are paradigmatic European creations, rests on the assumption that the state embodies the “will of the people.” The somewhat abstract concept of “will to representation” is converted into “sovereign will” and vested in the “state.” This presupposes that the role of the state and the state bureaucracy is to safeguard the interests of its citizens. In Europe, the rise of the welfare state dates back to the end of the First World War. But it was really after the Second World War, in a Europe destroyed and impoverished, that the Western European states, with the help of the Marshall Plan, began developing a new social model. The war had left Europe ideologically and morally dead, so rather than ideals or morals, the state offered comfort and security in exchange for obedience and taxes. This model seemed to work and offered a compromise—a European way—between the capitalist model of the U.S. and the communist one of the Soviet Union. Although some of this is true, the success of the model was predicated on and expanded through the economic preeminence of Western Europe allied to the U.S.—some would say a vassal—especially after the fall of the Soviet Union. Parallel to, and as a consequence of, the rise of the welfare system was the growth of the state and the ever-increasing tax burden on its citizens. Starting in the 1960s, to finance the state, the value-added tax was implemented—first in France and later throughout Europe. The justification for this new tax was that the state needed the funds to finance welfare benefits. Europeans accepted this and other substantial tax increases, as well as sweeping new laws and regulations, afraid of returning to a pre-war scenario and comfortable with state benefits. So much so that, in Europe, “the state” has become almost synonymous with “the welfare state.” This logic—Europe’s underlying social contract—has held Western European society together. Though not without critique, it was widely accepted. When François Bayrou proposed the €44 billion cut to social services that ended his government, both the right and the left voted against it. In France, where society is currently extremely polarized, this is not a minor detail but a significant indicator. The protests that have erupted in defense of the welfare state—on which both left and right are trying to capitalize—are further proof. The current push for costly military readiness and arms spending seems to go against the logic of the welfare state, which is to say, against the interests of ordinary Europeans, thus changing the state’s side of the social contract. Now the state offers security and protection, not order and welfare, and asks more—not less—of citizens. That logic, in turn, requires new threats and enemies—and the launching of new wars. This happens because the state is, economically and ideologically, bankrupt. This is not an anomaly but a feature of this model of state sovereignty as now embodied in the European Union. If the state embodies the “will of the people,” then the goal of the state, conceived as an expression of sovereign will, has to be nothing more than its perpetual existence. “It is not an end among others; it is that end for which all others can be sacrificed,” writes Paul W. Kahn in Putting Liberalism in Its Place. Well with people like Kaja Kallas, they will go from fighting Russia to the last Ukrainian to fighting Russia to the last European. Seems like a natural progression. Those living in democratic Western nations have always had the opportunity to oppose military buildups in preparation for war with Russia. Yet, they chose not to. If they end up living in hunger and poverty, they will only have themselves to blame. >>>If they end up living in hunger and poverty, they will only have themselves to blame. Just like us Americans who despite keeping voting for change keep getting shafted by both the Democrats and the Republicans? I don’t know much about European politics, but I think that European politics, just like American politics, is rigged to favor the oligarchs and the politicians who serve them. Sadly, in the UK we have lived under an increasingly party-based authoritarian liberal oligarchy dressed with a rapidly fading and shrinking tinsel of electoral democracy wrapped around it. The BBC, funded by every license holder, lies, both by commission and omission, as does the MSM and the channels the MSM supports on Youtube, &c (no, the Times and Telegraph channels may sound like derivatives of ‘Round the Horne’ but, alas, they are not). The UK is not very different from other European countries which seem to be responding in similar ways by supporting new parties which wish to cast aside many of the constraints imposed by tradition and more recent custom and practice. We Brits have attempted to control HMG’s willingness to go down to defeat in wars the USA has embroiled us from Korea, by acts of civil disobedience and political demonstrations, through the Cruise missile crisis and the wonderful women of Greenham Common, the vicious war against civil rights activists in Ulster, the destruction of Serbia’s territorial integrity, the illegal invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, the overthrow and murder of Gadaffi and other leaders in North and sub-Saharan Africa, and the murderous regime put in place by the US and British Ukrainian coup and the subsequent conflict over Russian civil rights in the Donbass leading to the SMO. Sadly, none of our efforts worked. So the only option is to support completely new parties and to clean house even more thoroughly than Cromwell did. The real choice at the next election will be between Reform and Your Party. The same process is occurring or has occurred in countries on the European mainland and it looks as if many governments are more than prepared to go to war against their own people to maintain the privileges of the politcal and financial élite. The British have been prepared to give their lives for liberty in the past and will do so again. And this is true of every European nation. Our future is one of economic decline unless we come to terms with the emerging new world order and this pressure will only intensify the movement towards the most unLampedusa-like changes in the body politic. Is there any possibility that a potential future target of the new European militarism might be to the south of the continent, across the sea? A second prize of resources, if first prize (Russia) doesn’t pan out? European entities seem to devolve toward the principle of following the will of the right people. Elitism can take many forms, from directing the lower orders to getting exclusive access to perks. More transparency showing the hidden levers and accounts would be a start toward citizen understanding. Who pushes so hard for weaponry and war, and why? And how do a few individuals get to cause so many problems? Looking at BoJo, for one. Who wants country welfare programs to be overwhelmed by migrants, political, economic or otherwise? It looks like a real race to the end is looming in Europe. Who will be killed off first? The destructor propagators of mass death – Leyen Kallas Rutte Merz Macron Starmer et al Or millions of individuals among the people of Europe, some of whom are slowly coming to realise what trap is being set up for them. People in all of Europe – Germans, Spaniards, Serbs, Italians, Poles, Brits. Everyone. The financial data suggest the OK Coral is a low single digits of years away. Scary. The European welfare state, along with Social Security and other programs in the US, was created in part to keep those filthy commies at bay, not out of the goodness of the elite heart. Once there was no more USSR to worry about…. I don’t think it’s a coincidence the concrete material benefits for citizens have been on the decline while the wealth disparity has increased drastically for the last 40 years or so. Nazis, the West is fine with – many Western countries gladly invited them in after hostilities were over. It’s the sharing bit that just can’t be tolerated. This is simply not true about the experience of Western Europe. Most Western European states had some form of welfare system in place by the inter-war years not least because of trades union pressure and the need to support the dependents of the lost male population during the Great War. Bismark created the German welfare state as part of his effort to ensure the unification of Germany and to provide a secure basis for German industrial workers and soldiers – and it worked, and the rest of us followed in Germany’s wake. But something else happened during The Great War–something in Russia. Surely this had an effect on how European governments treated the working class. Then when that thing was finally defeated ideologically Thatcher could proclaim “there is no alternative.” Which is not to argue that political ideas control history but rather to agree with Stephen Douglas that “power concedes nothing without a demand.” The Russian Revolution was that demand scared the Euro aristocracy mightily. Some effect, maybe. The move towards the welfare state in Europe began before that, however (1880s in Germany, 1900s in Britain… I think most European countries started introducing key elements of modern welfare systems like old age pension schemes, somewhere in 1880-1910s; the only one I can find quickly that could conceivably be blamed on us is Italy, 1919 – there are many other examples outside of Europe, and there things may have been different). It was influenced in large part by domestic “demand”, or by the desire to stave off their own socialist and unionist movements, but there were other considerations as well: inter-European competition; wanting to keep the race in shape to keep down the colonial populations; even, though you may dismiss that, Christian paternalism, patriotism and/or social progressivism as elements of elite ideology and self-image. The Great October Socialist Revolution/October coup did influence later development to some extent, but it merely reinforced preexisting trends. I am not sure if its influence was always a helpful one for this, for that matter – it also helped start a powerful right-wing backlash that did not compare to what existed before the war. And I’d say it’s also an example of how ideas do control history – if people in and out of power had not conceived of such reforms, no one would have enacted them. The development of the welfare states of Europe can be traced well back to the mid-19th Century at least – they were arguably the result of the weakening of religion and the strengthening of the secular state, but you can trace its origins well back to medieval times – many towns and cities has surprisingly sophisticated social systems designed to protect the poorest organised by various forms of town governance (councils/guilds,etc). The motives were the usual complex mix of compassion, religious belief, social pressure, ideology and fear. They long predate any fear of socialism, although not of course fear of peasant uprisings. Later northern European welfare systems, developed as private companies became larger and more influential and developed their own health/welfare systems (often, of course, under trade union pressure), and these in time became generalised by the State in order to iron out social pressures between those protected by those corporate systems and those (not necessarily poor) on the outside. The complexity of the history is one reason why these systems are so complex (a health economist friend was fond of joking that there are only about 3 people alive who understand how the Dutch health system works) and have roots that go well beyond the notional ‘start’ of any particular scheme. Its also a key reason as to why there are so many deep differences between their design and implementation across Europe. Even between quite ‘similar’ countries – such as Denmark and Sweden – there are often very fundamental differences in both the background politics and the nuts and bolts of implementation of these systems. For the most part, they work surprisingly well, despite several decades of attacks by neoliberals (even Thatcher feared tackling the NHS). The key threat, as the article alludes – is that the pension/care systems are for the most part based on assumptions of rising population/economic growth which no longer hold. This is, in my opinion, a key reason why domestic politicians have been so reluctant to tackle immigration. The projections are horrible if you rely on domestic fertility – but this applies now all over the developed and intermediately developed world. Its a nettle that has yet to be firmly grasped by any country. Oh, of course – I specifically meant the comparatively standardised and systematic modern welfare systems as pioneered by Bismarck or Lloyd George, but depending on one’s definitions, some forms of state (or, more often, municipal?) welfare existed for centuries or indeed for as long as human civilisation. Standardised welfare of the Bismarck type is, to my knowledge, a 19th century European novelty; so is the ideologically-driven rejection of state welfare, though indeed, even such fanatics as Thatcher had a healthy fear of going too far in attacking what people had come to rely on. ” Stephen” Douglas? Surely you mean Frederick Douglas. Yes sorry for the senior moment. And to the other replies to my comment I’ll just point out that the Russian revolution was preceded by others in Europe and perhaps most importantly our own which rejected a king (coming soon as Ken Burns PBS doc). I think the statement made by Frederick Douglas is to the point and that point is that those at the pinnacle of power do not back down other than from the threat of violence since violence is how they maintain their position. Even in enlightened 19th century Britain (paging Dickens) you could still be drawn and quartered. Of course democracy is supposed to provide another path which is why they are doing so much to undermine it. There are a lot of problems here, and a lot of misguided prejudices (I am not refering to the article, but about common knowledge). Europe, except the USSR, the last European power, was done in 1945. It was pretty clear in the Suez crisis. Yes, they were important countries in a slow decline, but decline. EEC-EU-Europe, or Euroamerica, is a marginal side of the US hegemonic system. The EEC was a optimizing system for the main economies of Western Europe, it was never designed for advanced but small countries like Sweden, Switzerland or Austria, not at all for undeveloped like Greece, Spain, Portugal, let alone ex-COMECON and the lot, not even the fiasco of a United Germany. It became a chaos. It was a economic device, not even a political one, the Paris-Berlin axis was a mirage (because of German partition), it lasted until 1990s, UK was ever a disloyal member, and the like. The political device was, and is, NATO, all the powerful countries of the EU are nothing without it, and the traction of NATO was to make the EU as similar to the US as possible as fast as possible. The welfare state was a concession by fear of the Soviet Union, which exists no more. There is no reason not to carry the EU to the same social welfare standards of the US, which is what is happening. Corruption is massive, as ever was, so if we don’t see things from this point of view, we hardly understand anything. Taxes are lower than ever, in the sense that they are not extracting money where it is, in fact they collect less and less in a suicidal temptative to keep alive the system. If things were that far away without resistance, it’s more than dubious they are going to change in the next few years. Firstly, people must be aware about reality, not the bubble where they forced to live, and only after that, something could happen. Or not. All these comments are well and good, but of course, the interesting part is the question of what Putin’s motivations are. Is the attack on Poland because of internal failures in Russia, or are their other reasons? Putin obviously has his eyes on Latvia and Estonia, where a goodly portion of the population is Russian. One would have thought that they would be easier anti-Nato targets. There is obviously a ‘message’ here. Poland has historically been vulnerable because it is flat, and a convenient invasion corridor. Back in the day, when the European militaries worried about mass invasions by tanks, that made sense. Mutandis mutandi, it’s a drone’s world now. And it’s not like Israel, which gets its military weapons free, courtesy of ‘foreign aid’ from the US. Putin has to pay for all the Iranian drones and missles as well as domestic arms production. Has something changed internally that makes expansion of hostilities desirable? I’m sure the there’s ‘less here than meets the eye’, but being merely a slightly astute citizen myself, I can’t suss it out. Was there even an attack on Poland? Even that badic premise remains unclear. One might as well ask what the Poles were thinking at Gleiwitz, 1939. Ukraine did hack Russia drones, then send them through Belarus. Belarus even warned Poland about the drones. Fun fact. The drones that entered Poland did not have the range to reach there if launched from Russian positions. It was too far as the Russians pointed out. So either they were taken there by magical tailwinds that no weather report shows or else these were captured drones that were launched by Zelensky to bring Poland and NATO into the fighting. I’m going with Door Number Two. UK media has commented that they were launched from Belarus. Reports from Belarus said that they had a few enter their airspace which were shot down so gave Poland a heads up that they might have a few come their way. As for UK media, they are on par with Oz media or German media which is not a high bar. Some Brits say that the BBC actually stands for the British Bull******* Corporation as an example. Bad Old debating Technique- answering a question with a question. Maybe they were just playing questions- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3xIs0aajN4 “The underlying social contract between individuals and the state in Western European nations over the last hundred years has been that the state would grow to regulate and tax virtually every sphere of life—public or private—in exchange for a measure of order and comfort for its citizens…” Even though the final para states “This is not an anomaly but a feature of this model of state sovereignty as now embodied in the European Union. ..” the author doesn’t appear to acknowledge that the underlying European social contract between individuals and the nation state was effectively broken with the adoption of the financially unfederated Brussels governed administered common currency structure of European Union 26 yrs ago. The individual nation states in adopting the Euro surrendered their capacity to deliver on that social contract to unelected administrators in Brussels. Each Eurozone member state in abandoning their national currency, gave up their fiscal sovereignty to adopt the Euro – effectively a foreign issued currency. Together with accepting an arbitrarily Brussels enforced annual 3% fiscal deficit limit it was inevitable that expanded state monetary needs for industry/population growth would eat into the available funds necessary to deliver on that social contract. The US, itself a nation of 50 fully financially federated states, knew full well the implications of that structure – a stealthy ploy to slowly but surely destroy European socialism. IMHO a structure designed to keep Europe down, socially divided with vassalised financial elites in firm, ever growing control. An article worth re-reading (after 13 yrs) by Greg Palas is ‘Robert Mundell, evil genius of the euro.’ Any residual social contract in the UK was erased from 1980 when unemployment first hit 2m down to the Thatcherite dogma that unemployment was “a price worth paying”. The loss of trust in the political class during deindustrialisation, and social insecurity, has led to the rise of right wing populist insurgents preying on disaffection. Any of the European nations which has experienced youth unemployment over 20% and poor real wage increases over the last few decades is likely to have the same social insecurity. I agree. The state demands you obey the laws, keep the peace, respect your fellow citizens. In other words, to put the common good before your individual good. In return the state must give you the opportunity to thrive within those constraints. If it doesn’t all bets are off. “Another European nation that might need an IMF bailout—perhaps even more urgently than France—is the UK. The UK’s debt is becoming significantly more expensive to service due to a sharp rise in borrowing costs, which now amount to over £100 billion annually—nearly 10% of the national budget…” The UK does not need an IMF bailout – The UK is the sole fully sovereign issuer of the UK£. It can pay any debt it incurs denominated in the UK£. When will journalists ever spend the time researching how National monetary systems actually function? In a democracy with well informed citizens then the choice between having billionaires or having a social safety net would be easy. As is then I’d say that either the citizens aren’t well-informed and we have democracy or we don’t have democracy and what we do have is oligarchy. A subtle choice of words can be used when engaging in propaganda. The difference in outcome between asking if people want a welfare state or if they want a social safety net is (at least in my strong belief) huge. I believe that as long as the ‘opposition’ to the status quo are using phrases suggested by supporters of the status quo then the ‘opposition’ will not drive any change.

Title: CIA/Mossad False Flag Psyop Kicks Off on First Day of Skool While Antichrist Peter Thiel Takes Control of Government

Editor Podcasts Jeff Berwick, The Dollar Vigilante It’s hard to believe, but summer is already wrapping up (for most, anyway). That one went fast. We’re sliding into the exact window I said would bring a major crash/collapse, but I’ll circle back to that shortly. The young minds of the USSA are already being marched back into the camps, to be reshaped and conditioned until they’re ready to wear that Saturn cube on their heads, provided they obey well enough. And, right on cue, day one brought the first psy-op of the skool year, staged and broadcast by the CIA/Mossad tag team through their media mouthpieces. On August 27, 23-year-old Robin/Robert Westman, a former student at Annunciation Catholic Skool in Minneapolis, supposedly showed up at the connected church with a rifle, a shotgun, and a pistol (all “legally purchased,” of course), and blasted through stained glass windows into a packed Mass. An 8-year-old and a 10-year-old were killed. Seventeen others wounded – 14 kids and 3 elderly parishioners in their 80s. Tragic. Terrifying. And, if you’re paying attention, textbook. At this point, you almost don’t even need to look into the details anymore, because every skool shooting in the USSA might as well be stamped “CIA/Mossad Production” right from the start. Usually, after a few minutes of digging, you’ll see the fingerprints: a trans MK Ultra patsy, the same shady networks funding and covering, and, surprise, surprise, BlackRock lurking in the background. But this time? They didn’t even bother hiding it. The shooter’s weapon literally had “Sponsored by BlackRock” scribbled on it. And headlines screamed things like: “Minneapolis shooter was ‘tired of being trans’ and had been ‘brainwashed’ into being female.” Translation: yes, the shooter was under mind control. They said it out loud. So, let’s ask the investigator’s first question: Who benefits? Well, the shooter’s gun was also covered with scribbles like “6 million wasn’t enough,” “Jew Gas,” “Burn Israel,” “Israel must fall.” And just like that, the script kicked in. Agenda #1: Call it an “anti-semitic hate crime.” Even though the target was a Catholic skool. Even though neither shooter nor victims were “semitic” in any sense of the word (and let’s be honest, most people in Israhell aren’t either). Still, headlines push the “anti-semitic” label, and in the background, laws and crackdowns on so-called hate speech get ratcheted up another notch. Agenda #2: Who, right now, is openly bloodthirsty for killing goyim children? Exactly. And here it is again, reframed as an “attack on the chosen,” while they do the very thing they accuse others of. They’re masters at flipping the script. Agenda #3: Victim politics. Somehow, this was also spun into another notch in the “trans people are under attack” narrative. They never miss a beat. Agenda #4: Gun grab. Fox News, politicians, the usual suspects paraded in front of cameras, calling to ban “assault rifles.” Some even floated the idea that young white men, specifically, should be disarmed. Agenda #5: Surveillance expansion. Calls for “pre-crime” systems à la Palantir. The idea? That the government should know everything you think, feel, and intend before you even act. Predictive policing, Minority Report, straight-up thought-crime. All from one operation. Problem → Reaction → Solution. The Hegelian dialectic is alive and well. And, that’s just one op layered with multiple payoffs. There are plenty more running in parallel right now. But what they really need is a global event – something catastrophic enough to make normies beg for the digital prison. Something that makes people say, “Please, track me, watch me, jab me, save me.” That’s where September might very likely come in. For example: A staged strike blamed on Russia, or Iran, could flip the switch. “Pearl Harbor 2.0” to rally the sheep. One missile, one explosion, one “accident” in September could be all it takes to justify the next forever war. Or, maybe a Plandemic 2.0 rollout. Already, the headlines whisper about “new variants.” Masks creeping back. There’s no stopping the Crime And Death Corporation (CDC), who now has a Peter Thiel inner-circle crony as its new CEO. Notice the timing. Right before September, they prime the headlines with “rising Covid variants”, with ‘no symptoms’ still a terrifying, invisible symptom. Don’t worry if you can’t get your 11th booster immediately, RFK Jr. will soon be rolling out the all encompassing natural immunity mRNA jab. Or, a massive ‘climate change’ apocalyptic event. Or, a Titanic-sized market crash. This time, they want everyone in the pen. But, this time, instead of lockdowns first, they’ll use digital ID + AI as the solution. “Want to work? Want to travel? Want to eat? Just hitch your vax pass and your digital money to Palantir’s fascist technocrat wagon. You can’t make this shit up. Round Two will be smoother, faster, harder to escape. The only question left is: which card will they play first?

REUTERS/Amit Dave/File Photo/File Photo | Photo Credit: AMIT DAVE Indian and foreign lenders have significantly increased their exposure to the Adani group over the past 12-15 months, betting on its infrastructure play consisting of cash flow generating real assets. The exposure of Indian lenders has risen over 50 per cent to over ₹1.3 lakh crore, while that of foreign banks has risen 16 per cent to ₹71,744 crore. Domestic lenders’ share in the total debt has risen to over 50 per cent now from 40 per cent last year. This comes at a time when billionaire founder of the group Gautam Adani is being investigated by US regulators for alleged wire and securities fraud and a bribery scheme. Funding through US dollar bonds, a favourite avenue for the group, has fallen 11 per cent during the period as the group has consciously stayed away from the overseas public bond markets pending the settlement of the ongoing probes against it. In April, it did raise $750 million through a private bond sale, a third of which was subscribed by Blackrock. Its overseas bond holders are long-only investors and includes names such as Blackrock, AIA, Pimco, Fidelity, Apollo Global, MetLife, Cigna and Goldman Sachs. The group has been aggressively tapping Indian institutions, and proof of the trust placed in it is the ₹5,000 crore that Life Insurance Corporation invested in the non-convertible debentures issued by Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone in May this year, to refinance short-term debt. Most of the rise in exposure by Indian lenders is accounted for by public sector banks led by State Bank of India and non-bank and institutional lenders. Sources pointed out that the lenders are getting comfort from its robust cash flows – well over ₹60,000 crore or about a quarter of its total debt – and that it is creating long-term infrastructure assets. For instance, around 80 per cent of its recent capital expenditure has gone into expanding its green energy portfolio. It is planning to spend around $70 billion in green investments. Last financial year the group’s capex was close to $15 billion, and Adani has indicated an annual spend of $15-20 billion over the next five years. Of its total EBITDA of close to ₹90,000 crore, over 80 per cent is accounted for by its core infrastructure businesses that comprise its energy portfolio, transport and the businesses being incubated under Adani Enterprises, such as airports. The energy companies in its portfolio have entered into long term power purchase agreements that provide cash visibility for extended periods. For instance, in May, Adani Green Energy signed a 40-year PPA for a 1.25 GW pumped hydro project in Uttar Pradesh. Adani Power also has a 25-year agreement to supply thermal power to the State.

Rather, the recently appointed leader for the publicly traded company—which has rapidly amassed over $3.7 billion worth of Ethereum—believes it will be a positive "white swan event" that brings institutional ETH adoption to levels never seen before. Joseph Chalom told Decrypt that the firm is putting Ethereum on the radar of non-crypto companies and educating them on the potential of the network. As such, he thinks it's “inevitable” that more big players will adopt Ethereum as stablecoins and tokenization become mainstream. “When they start realizing that they can reduce their capital requirements for trading, when they think they can reduce the risk involved in trading and transacting, and moving money, I think it's going to be inevitable,” he explained. “The white swan event is: We're explaining to users what the potential is, and you're starting to see that adoption.” The comments come amid growing concern that the surging crypto treasury company trend could end in disaster, with fears intensifying at the same pace as the trend’s growing popularity as bears cite the huge amounts of tokens the biggest firms are accumulating. SharpLink, at the time of writing, holds 837,230 ETH, or approximately 0.69% of the total circulating ETH supply—raising concerns about whether they’d ever sell. “We are not sellers of Ethereum. We are accumulators of Ethereum,” Chalom told Decrypt. “And if there are moments that you need liquidity, you can raise liquidity through debt instruments. You could do stock buybacks. So our intent is not to sell our Ethereum. It's a reserve asset, not a trading asset.” This approach was pioneered by Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin treasury company, Strategy, previously known as MicroStrategy. The one-time business software company has raised capital via debt instruments such as multiple rounds of convertible note offerings, and continued to stockpile BTC—now holding over $72 billion worth. Consequently, users on Myriad Markets—a prediction market developed by Decrypt’s parent company DASTAN—see a more than 94% likelihood that Strategy will not sell any Bitcoin this year. As a result, Chalom categorically ruled out the crypto treasury trend being the black swan event of this cycle—a term for a rare event that has a severe impact on the market, such as the FTX collapse. “Absolutely not, unless you mean the black swan event to drive mind share and adoption,” Chalom said. “The reason why I say it's just not even in the same league as [FTX] is this is the most transparent approach you can have.” The former BlackRock head of digital assets strategy explained that due to SharpLink being a public company, it is regulated by the SEC and required to follow Nasdaq rules. The firm puts out a weekly press release disclosing its holdings, purchase price, accumulated ETH rewards, and more. By comparison, he argues, the FTX situation came out of a lack of transparency. As Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX crumbled, it was discovered that the crypto exchange was sharing customer funds with his trading firm Alameda Research, to help shore up its losses. That meant that when a large number of FTX users sought to withdraw their funds, the exchange didn’t have the capital ready to fill those requests. Chalom argued that a public company couldn’t get away with such a scheme, due to its required transparency and adherence to regulations. Still, FTX was required to follow the law even as a private company, and Bankman-Fried was ultimately sentenced to 25 years in prison for his involvement in fraud and conspiracy at FTX. Chalom believes that SharpLink is building interest in Ethereum among major institutions, which he thinks will soon adopt the technology. Be it stablecoins, tokenizing real-world assets, or deploying programmable money, the co-CEO expects that the biggest players will be using Ethereum soon. And, he says, SharpLink is the first step in educating those players about cryptocurrency. “There's a giant amount of education here,” Chalom said. “And I think it doesn't take convincing, it takes explaining.” When compared to Bitcoin, which is often marketed as “digital gold,” selling Ethereum to traditional investors is a much more complicated process. That’s why, he said, Ethereum’s price may have lagged behind Bitcoin’s over the past year as investors flocked to Bitcoin ETFs more than Ethereum ones. That, he said, is set to change. “It was just easier to explain its role in a portfolio,” Chalom said of Bitcoin. “[With] Ethereum, you're telling them a network effect growth story, that is no different in some ways than Web1 and the internet. It's essentially the decentralized internet moment of both finance and other real-world activity.” “That just took a look a little bit longer to explain, and the adoption will take longer,” he added. “It just may have an impact that's 10, 20x on what Bitcoin has had on the financial ecosystem.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Institutions continue to double down on crypto. BlackRock’s crypto stash topped $100 billion, less than two years since Spot BTC and ETH ETFs debuted. Will the ETH ETF staking approval expand the holdings? The world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, now controls over $100 billion worth of crypto, underscoring increasing institutional demand for the asset class. According to Arkham data, the firm’s Bitcoin [BTC] holdings have grown to 740.5K coins worth about $85 billion as of press time. Source: Arkham Ethereum [ETH] is the second-largest crypto asset held by BlackRock. As of writing, the firm had 3.66 million ETH, worth about $16B, collectively bringing its core holdings to over $100B. However, BlackRock’s ETH accumulation has lost some steam towards the end of Q3, compared to BTC. For BTC, it ramped up its stash from 698K BTC to over 740K, about 6% surge in the past two months. Source: Bitcoin Treasuries In the past seven days of trading, BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust has seen over 58K ETH outflows, about a 1.4% decline over the same period. The net assets dropped from over $17B to $15.9B amid the outflows and ETH price pullback. Source: SoSo Value According to analytics firm LookOnChain, BlackRock sold nearly $200M worth of ETH on the 9th of September, 2x higher than the amount of BTC ($100M) offloaded over the same period. Simply put, investors in BlackRock crypto products have shown remarkable resilience in BTC compared to ETH. Source: LookOnChain However, it remains to be seen how the potential staking approval could improve the overall demand for ETH ETFs. That said, Spot BTC ETFs remain the keyholders of BTC. As of September, this category of investors controls about 7% (1.4 million) of BTC’s total 21 million supply of coins. In contrast, corporate treasuries, led by Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), command 4.6% (1 million BTC) of the overall supply.

BlackRock, J.P. Morgan and CPP Investments are among several institutional investors that potentially missed out on billions of dollars in gains by dumping millions of shares in Google parent Alphabet Inc. just before the stock ascended to a 52-week high. The tech giant’s Class A share price climbed steadily during the second quarter, rising 29% from its 52-week low of $140.53 on April 7 to $181.23 on June 30. The shares surged further to a 52-week high of $232.37 on September 4 after a court ruled that Google will not be forced to sell its Chrome browser. Google’s nonvoting C shares traded between a low of $142.66 on April 7 and a high of $182.45 on June 10. The trading activity was reported in second quarter filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, but the sale dates and prices were not disclosed. Based on the high and low stock prices during the quarter, sellers potentially missed out on gains of at least 28% and as much as 65%, as of September 4. Investors who sold Alphabet’s nonvoting C shares (GOOG) potentially missed out on runs of 28% to 64%. Among the sellers, BlackRock sold approximately 9.4 million Alphabet Class A shares and about 3 million Class C shares during Q2. The total sale price of the A-shares ranged from $1.32 billion to $1.70 billion, while C shares sold for $428.9 million to $548.5 million.

The sales reduced Capital Research’s holdings in Alphabet A shares and C shares by 19% and 24%, respectively. Had the firm held on to the A shares, they would have been worth $2.33 billion as of September 4, potentially missing out on gains of between $520 million to $920 million. Capital Research’s C shares would have been worth $2.03 billion as of the same date, with potential value of $435 million to $785 million. J.P. Morgan sold approximately 4.2 million Class A shares during Q2 for between $590.2 million and $761.2 million.

The regulator requested for more time to review recent filings SEC has delayed its decision on several altcoins and staking ETFs filings to October and November. Will the approvals trigger a strong market rally in Q4? The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delayed its decision on several crypto ETFs and related staking applications. The regulator requested more time until late October or mid-November to review the requests from interested issuers. On the pending Ethereum [ETH] ETF staking list, BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, Fidelity, 21Shares, and Grayscale were all delayed. Source: SEC For BlackRock’s staking application, the agency extended the final deadline to the 30th of October. The world’s largest asset manager made its first filing for this provision in July. The decision on Franklin Templeton’s crypto index and ETF staking permission was pushed to the 13th of November. In addition, the agency postponed the decision on Spot Solana [SOL] and Ripple [XRP] applications by Franklin Templeton to the 14th of November. Already, the market was extremely positive about the outcome of these altcoin ETF filings. In fact, XRP Futures hit a record level amid anticipation ahead of the Q4 deadline. Despite the delay, issuers continue to submit new crypto ETF filings with the regulator. Asset manager VanEck is reportedly planning to file for a Spot Hyperliquid [HYPE] staking ETF in the U.S. and an exchange-traded offering in Europe. According to a Bloomberg ETF analyst, James Seyffart, there are over 90 crypto ETFs waiting for the SEC’s decision. This includes even memecoins. In fact, the first U.S.-based memecoin ETF, a Dogecoin [DOGE], will debut this week, setting the stage for potentially more approvals. Additionally, even chances of ETH staking approval remain high. Especially after the recent SEC’s guidance that liquid staking tokens aren’t securities, but receipts that show proof of deposits. The massive wave of crypto ETFs follows the regulatory shift and ongoing clarity that most crypto tokens aren’t securities. However, if approved, the public demand for these altcoin ETF products will determine whether they will be traded on public exchanges for an extended period of time or be delisted.

Get businessline apps on Connect with us TO ENJOY ADDITIONAL BENEFITS Connect With Us Get BusinessLine apps on JioBlackRock, the partnership between Jio Financials and the world’s largest asset managers BlackRock, received its license in May and currently manages around ₹18,000 crore | Photo Credit: CARLO ALLEGRI JioBlackRock Mutual Fund on Thursday said it will launch its first active equity product, JioBlackRock FlexiCap Fund, on the Systematic Active Equity platform on September 23, but refrained from setting any collection target for the new fund during the initial offer period. “This is our first active equity fund. Three or four other active equity funds are in the pipeline, which may see the light of day this fiscal. Other products, including ETFs, will follow in due course,” JioBlackRock AMC chief investment officer Rishi Kohli said. The fund, built on BlackRock’s globally proven SAE platform, follows a rules-based and predominantly machine-driven process tracking 400 signals. About 95 per cent of the investment process will be technology-driven, aiming to eliminate key-person risk, reduce cognitive biases, and ensure disciplined fund management. The SAE Flexi-Cap Fund will maintain a controlled active risk of no more than 3-4 per cent, lower than industry averages, with a focus on downside risk protection and consistent returns for investors. Kohli said a 10-year simulation indicated the model could deliver 3-4 per cent outperformance over the benchmark index, similar to results achieved in other BlackRock country funds. “In an uncertain market environment, where equity markets have been tough, we believe it’s a good time to launch a product that manages risk on the lower side compared to other active funds and still aims for attractive alpha in the long run,” Kohli said. JioBlackRock, the partnership between Jio Financials and the world's largest asset managers BlackRock, received its license in May and currently manages around ₹18,000 crore in assets across eight cash and index funds. The fund house will continue to focus on digital distribution in the near term. The official, however, did not comment on AUM targets or a break-even timeline.

Today's top news: Solana just printed a seven-month high. And its fresh new narrative may be enough to drive it to new ATHs in 2025. SOL climbed ~4% Wednesday to nearly $225, its highest level since February, and is up about 25% over the past month. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan says the same forces that powered Bitcoin and Ethereum’s rally (ETF inflows and corporate/treasury accumulation) are now lining up for Solana, setting the stage for an “epic end-of-year run.” Here’s a glimpse at what’s happening for Solana right now: It’s a very nice setup. “For the last 18 months, the recipe for strong returns in crypto has been clear: Take one part exchange traded products (ETP) inflows, add strong corporate treasury purchases, and voilà-you get big returns… All the ingredients are there for an epic end-of-year run for Solana.” - Matt Hougan, CIO, Bitwise This is one of those trades that feels too easy to be true. But SOL has nearly the exact same setup as BTC and ETH before it. Institutional flows have been the primary force driving crypto majors price action over the past 18 months. And now it’s Solana’s turn. They’ve got ~$3B in SOL TreasuryCo’s incoming and ETFs coming Q4 (though it should be noted that BlackRock isn’t in the mix, the highest volume ETF facilitator). And a strong ecosystem, with apps like Pump Fun driving top-5 revenue numbers across all of crypto. It’s certainly not a done deal by any means. The TreasuryCo’s could end up being underwhelming. The ETFs might not catch much volume in the early months. Leading apps might sputter. But with many thinking Bitcoin will make sweeping new ATHs in Q4 2025 (I’m in this cohort), it’s not a big stretch to think SOL will also make a run. And it has real drivers.

This latest purchase comes as ETH price shows signs of recovery, gaining 3% today to $4,440, amid broader crypto market rally. Tom Lee’s BitMine continues with its aggressive Ethereum purchases, adding another 46,255 coins, worth a massive $200million, to their ETH treasury, on September 11. The purchase follows Monday’s acquisition of 202,500 ETH, pushing BitMine’s total holdings past 2.1 million ETH, valued at more than $9.2 billion. With the latest addition, BitMine maintains its lead as the largest corporate holder of Ethereum, far ahead of Sharplink Gaming’s 837,000 ETH treasury. According to the data from Strategic ETH Reserve, BitMine’s two big ETH purchases this week nearly matched the total ETH accumulated by all treasury firms last week. The ETH treasury firms have been raising more cash ammunition, through stock and bond sales, to further build their Ethereum reserves. Last week, corporate buyers accumulated 273,300 ETH in total, with The Ether Machine leading the purchases at 150,000 ETH, followed by BitMine with 74,300 ETH.

PsiQuantum, a US-based quantum computing company, has secured $1bn in Series E funding to accelerate the development of fault-tolerant quantum computers. This funding round was led by affiliates of BlackRock with contributions from Temasek and Baillie Gifford. It values PsiQuantum at $7bn and introduces new investors, including entities managed by Macquarie Capital and Ribbit Capital. The gold standard of business intelligence. Find out more This investment aims to support the establishment of utility-scale quantum computing sites in Brisbane, Australia and Chicago and will aid in the deployment of large-scale prototype systems. It further aims to advance PsiQuantum’s quantum photonic chips and architecture. PsiQuantum’s approach is driven by its focus on error correction, which it believes necessitates around a million physical qubits to achieve commercially viable quantum computing. The company aims to address significant challenges such as manufacturability, cooling, and networking by leveraging the advantages of photonic qubits alongside semiconductor manufacturing processes. PsiQuantum co-founder and CEO Jeremy O’Brien said: “Only building the real thing—million-qubit-scale, fault-tolerant machines—will unlock the promise of quantum computing. “We defined what it takes from day one: this is a grand engineering challenge, not a science experiment. We tackled the hardest problems first—at the architectural and chip level—and are now mass-manufacturing best-in-class quantum photonic chips at a leading US semiconductor fab. Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. “With this funding, we’re ready to take the next decisive steps to deliver the full potential of quantum computing.” Since its Series D funding in 2021, PsiQuantum has established a high-volume manufacturing process for its photonic chipset at GlobalFoundries’ facility in New York. A critical development is the integration of Barium Titanate (BTO) into its production line. BTO plays a crucial role in optical switches necessary for scaling optical quantum computing. The latest funding is expected to help the firm to further scale up the production of BTO towards the volumes required for utility-scale quantum computing. PsiQuantum manufactures BTO wafers in California before integrating them with those produced at GlobalFoundries. Nvidia’s venture capital arm, NVentures, is also among the new investors in PsiQuantum. The quantum company has also entered into a partnership with Nvidia, which spans several areas, including quantum algorithms, software development, and graphics processing unit (GPU)-quantum processing unit (QPU) integration. This collaboration supports advancements in PsiQuantum’s silicon photonics platform. Additionally, the firm is said to be actively working on systems that do not rely on traditional cryostats. Instead, it has developed a high-density cooling solution similar to data centre racks, capable of accommodating multiple quantum chips. Earlier in 2025, PsiQuantum completed the research phase of US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) Underexplored Systems for Utility-Scale Quantum Computing (US2QC) programme. The project now moves into the validation phase under DARPA’s Quantum Benchmarking Initiative. This phase will evaluate system design, component performance, and application use cases, marking a significant step towards realising commercially viable quantum computing systems.

Check out our Live Next Crypto to Explode Updates for September 11, 2025! Crypto is so unthinkably huge at the moment, a nearly $4 trillion industry that’s aiming for world domination. Recent headlines talk of Circle and Mastercard planning to add USDC to global payment systems, Ethereum and Bitcoin treasuries in the billions of dollars, and Google building its own blockchain. Bitcoin has an all-time growth of over 180,000,000%, Dogecoin over 43,000%, and some of the newest presale coins often pump 10x, 100x, or even 1,000x on rare occasions. Explosive potential is probably the single best description for what we’re seeing today in crypto. Quick Picks for Coins with Explosive Potential If you’re looking for the most recent insights on the next crypto to explode, stay tuned. We update this page frequently throughout the day, as we get the latest and greatest insider insights for chart sniffers and traders looking for the next coin to explode. September 11, 2025 • 15:00 UTC Some of the biggest companies in Asia are embracing crypto. First up, South Korea’s e-commerce giant Coupang is teaming up with the blockchain Tempo. This hints at the possibility of stablecoins being used for payments, saving hundreds of billions of won a year. Then, over in Japan, they’ve launched the first-ever credit card that lets you use stablecoins to pay your bills. The new Nudge Card system uses a yen-backed stablecoin, so now you can use it for repayments anywhere that takes VISA. With all the big-name adoption and market attention, it poses the question: which project will be the next crypto to explode? PepeNode ($PEPENODE) is a prime candidate, as it’s creating a mine-to-earn game where you can earn rewards without needing expensive hardware. Find out how to buy $PEPENODE and don’t miss the chance for 1388% staking rewards. September 11, 2025 • 14:07 UTC Users on CoinMarketCap are theorizing that altcoin season might be coming – Ethereum inflows topped Bitcoin inflows in August. According to them, this has often preceded altcoin pumps. And if we’re talking altcoins, then we can’t help but mention Maxi Doge ($MAXI), a fresh meme coin on presale that’s ready to take over Dogecoin’s crown as the memecoin king. Our Maxi Doge price prediction forecasts a price of $0.0024 by the end of 2025, roughly +848% from current prices. September 11, 2025 • 13:00 UTC The US Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Paul Atkins declared that ‘crypto’s time has come,’ during his keynote address at the OECD Roundtable on Global Financial Markets held in Paris yesterday. He reiterated that the US government’s commitment is to make the country the world’s crypto capital. To achieve this, Atkins emphasized the need to ‘provide certainty regarding the security status of crypto assets.’ With legislation such as the GENIUS Act, the US is inching closer to achieving this goal. In addition, this paves the way for the next crypto to explode, like Pepenode ($PEPENODE). The token will power its planned virtual mining ecosystem, allowing individuals to mine crypto without any equipment. With mining becoming more complex and requiring expensive specialized equipment, Pepenode can help democratize this crucial process in the world of cryptocurrencies. Learn how to get your tokens in our ‘How to Buy Pepenode’ guide. September 11, 2025 • 12:00 UTC Apple is gearing up to launch the iPhone 17. Not only is it attracting attention over its new camera and ceramic shield, but it’ll also help crypto enthusiasts avoid potential threats. By enabling an A19 chip that enables Memory Integrity Enforcement (MIE), the new mobile device will make it difficult for scammers to steal private keys and digital assets. Given that private key compromises were the largest single cause of stolen assets across the entire industry last year at 43.8%, its tech has never been more necessary for crypto lovers. Still, you can protect your assets even further by downloading Best Wallet on your iPhone. As a non-custodial wallet, it ensures only you have control over your private keys so that no third party can access your funds. And, suppose you happen to lose your recovery phrase or seed phrase, don’t worry: it also has secure cloud backup storage. It’s also multi-chain, featuring cutting-edge features like a swap function, and an upcoming crypto debit card – and that’s just the beginning. The project’s native token – $BEST – fuels these developments, as 25% of its total token supply will go toward product expansion. It also grants lower gas fees, staking rewards, governance rights, and exclusive access to presales. So, it’s no wonder that it’s anticipated to be the next crypto to explode. Read our Best Wallet review for more information. September 11, 2025 • 11:07 UTC BNB hit an all-time high of $907 yesterday, almost immediately after Binance announced a partnership with Franklin Templeton. The goal – new crypto initiatives and products. The collaboration looks to combine Binance’s global infrastructure with Franklin Templeton’s tokenization expertise to deliver a deadly combo of efficiency and accessibility. Roger Bayston, Head of Digital Assets at Franklin Templeton, said this: By working with Binance, we can deliver breakthrough products that meet the requirements of global capital markets and co-create the portfolios of the future. —Roger Bayston, Binance Blog Post This has sent BNB exploding by almost 6% in the last day, with a 64% increase in its 24h trading volume. Similarly, altcoins are ready to explode, and meme coins as well. One meme coin in particular that traders are watching is Maxi Doge ($MAXI), Dogecoin’s wilder, younger cousin that wants to dethrone the king. How, you ask? Lots of Red Bull, steroids, and sleepless nights scalping shitcoins hoping to make a fortune and get ahead. And the degen attitude is working – one whale bought $37.3K $MAXI. Here’s how to buy Maxi Doge if you plan on joining this train that’s on fire. September 11, 2025 • 10:00 UTC PumpSwap ($PUMP) is back in the spotlight, surging 41.6% this week to a $5.8B valuation – its highest since launch. After dipping to $2.4B last month, the Solana-based memecoin launchpad has rallied 133%, powered by a bold buyback strategy: 100% of daily revenue goes toward repurchasing $PUMP, offsetting over 6% of supply to date. With PumpSwap stacking $298M in TVL and ranking 2nd in spot DEX revenue, it’s clear: the degens are back, and they’re hungry. But while $PUMP’s riding high, the real sleeper play is PepeNode ($PEPENODE). With nearly $975K already raised in presale, it introduces a Mine-to-Earn model where users build virtual mining rigs, upgrade nodes, and earn rewards before the token even hits exchanges. It’s gamified staking meets DeFi, with 1414% APY, 70% burn mechanics, and referral bonuses that fuel viral growth. No hardware, no waiting, just strategy and community. If you missed the $PUMP rally, PepeNodes might be your chance at the next crypto to explode. Find out how to buy PepeNode from the presale for just $0.0010533 September 11, 2025 • 10:00 UTC New ETFs from Rex and Osprey are launching this week. They’re not your typical Bitcoin funds: they’re ETFs for popular altcoins like KRP, Dogecoin, and Bonk. It’s a big deal as the SEC has given them the green light by allowing them to pass their 75-day review window. The project’s focus on futures contracts holds them to an older law. But the SEC has kept major players like BlackRock stuck in a regulatory waiting game as they focus on the actual crypto. The move could open the floodgates for mainstream investors who want to get into crypto without buying tokens directly. And speaking of getting in on the action, the Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) project is making waves. It’s a community built to help you get an edge. They’ve created the Wepe Army, a group that shares expert insights and alpha calls, which is insider info that can give you a leg up on the market. $WEPE is even rewarding members for their social activity, creating a collective of people working to outsmart the big players. Learn how to buy the $WEPE token with our ‘How to Buy Wall Street Pepe’ guide.

Hayes has accumulated multiple tranches of Ethena’s ENA token over the past two days, including 578,956 tokens worth about $473,000 on Wednesday and two earlier purchases totaling roughly 672,800 ENA, or $521,000, according to data tracked by Arkham Intelligence. The total, including those from Monday, amounts to roughly $995,000 worth of Ethena tokens within a 48-hour window. Hayes’ purchases come as Ethena remains a contender in the USDH stablecoin race, with Hyperliquid validators set to decide the ticker on Sunday. Ethena’s proposal, backed by BlackRock, would use its USDtb stablecoin to collateralize USDH via BlackRock’s BUIDL fund, with 95% of revenue pledged to Hyperliquid and costs covered for shifting trading pairs from USDC. Ethena’s proposal is a “strong bid from one of crypto’s fastest-growing and most impressive ecosystems,” David Lawant, head of research at FalconX, wrote in a blog post published Wednesday. Lawant pointed to USDe’s market cap of more than $13 billion and Ethena having processed $23 billion in cumulative mints and redemptions without security incidents or downtime. Still, Hayes’ buy “reads as personal positioning, rather than putting a backing behind Ethena specifically for the USDH votes,” Kirby Ong, founder of HypurrCollective, a grassroots collective for founders, builders, traders, and power users on the Hyperliquid ecosystem, told Decrypt.“With the $USDH proposal, the deciding factors will likely come down to validator alignments with their current stakers, whether prediction market sentiment translates into actual on-chain votes,” Ong said. Paxos, backed by PayPal, is also a top contender, according to Lawant. It revised its proposal on Wednesday, expanding from an emphasis on regulatory pedigree to pledging a larger share of reserve yield to Hyperliquid’s Assistance Fund and deferring any issuer take until the product scales past $1 billion. On Wednesday evening, Paxos announced it had received an offer from Kraken to list USDH and HYPE from day one, with free USD on- and off-ramps, pending the exchange’s standard review. Meanwhile, Native Markets remains front and center. Despite being a newly formed company, Native Markets remains the top contender, with 90% odds in its favor, according to live data on Myriad Markets. Disclosure: Myriad is a prediction market developed by Decrypt's parent company DASTAN. Native Markets pitched a GENIUS-compliant USDH managed through Bridge, Stripe’s stablecoin issuer, with reserves in cash and Treasuries overseen by BlackRock off-chain and Superstate on-chain. Its plan splits yield evenly between Hyperliquid’s Assistance Fund and ecosystem growth, and promises a HyperEVM launch with seamless interoperability. Ong explained that while prediction markets “help set expectations,” validator support “determines the valid candidates,” and that “ultimately, anyone can help to decide and set the direction for USDH by staking their weight and making their votes known by delegating to the validator that best matches their vote.”Ong added: “The final outcome on Sunday may depend on which team gains the most trust and perceived long-term value for the ecosystem.” Decrypt has reached out to Hayes, Paxos, and Ethena for comment. A separate request was sent to Native Markets through an ecosystem operator (Max Feige). Other contenders include Sky, the issuer of USDS (formerly MakerDAO’s DAI), Frax Finance with a bank-partnered bid, and Agora, which has warned against Native Markets’ reliance on Stripe-owned Bridge while pledging to channel all net revenue back into Hyperliquid.

Archives Wild, scenic, and toxic: Recent degradation of an iconic Arctic watershed with permafrost thaw, Sullivan et al., Proceedings of the National Academy of Science The streams of Alaska’s Brooks Range lie within a vast (~14M ha) tract of protected wilderness and have long supported both resident and anadromous fish. However, dozens of historically clear streams have recently turned orange and turbid. Thawing permafrost is thought to have exposed sulfide minerals to weathering, delivering iron and other potentially toxic metals to aquatic ecosystems. Here, we report stream water metal concentrations throughout the federally designated Wild and Scenic Salmon River watershed and compare them with United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) chronic (4-d) exposure thresholds for toxicity to aquatic life. The main stem of the Salmon had elevated SO42− concentrations and elevated SO42−: Ca relative to a predisturbance baseline for most of its length, consistent with increased sulfide mineral weathering. Most of the tributaries also had elevated SO42− concentrations and elevated SO42−: Ca, especially those in the upper watershed. The Salmon River mainstem consistently exceeded EPA chronic exposure thresholds for total recoverable iron, total recoverable aluminum, and dissolved cadmium from its first major tributary to its mouth. Nine of ten major tributaries that we sampled exceeded EPA thresholds for at least one metal on at least one of three sampling dates. Our findings indicate that habitat quality for resident and anadromous fish has been severely degraded in the Salmon River watershed. Loss of important spawning habitat in the Salmon and many other streams in the region might help explain a recent crash in chum salmon returns, which local communities depend upon for commercial and subsistence harvest. Speleothem evidence for Late Miocene extreme Arctic amplification – an analogue for near-future anthropogenic climate change?, Umbo et al., Climate of the Past Our estimate of > 18 °C of Arctic warming supports the wider consensus of a warmer-than-present Miocene and provides a rare palaeo-analogue for future Arctic amplification under high-emissions scenarios. The reconstructed increase in mean surface temperature far exceeds temperatures projected in fully coupled global climate models, even under extreme-emissions scenarios. Given that climate models have consistently underestimated the extent of recent Arctic amplification, our proxy data suggest Arctic warming may exceed current projections. Long-term decline in montane insects under warming summers, Sockman, Ecology Widespread declines in the abundance of insects portend ill-fated futures for their host ecosystems, all of which require their services to function. For many such reports, human activities have directly altered the land or water of these ecosystems, raising questions about how insects in less impacted environments are faring. I quantified the abundance of flying insects during 15 seasons spanning 2004–2024 on a relatively unscathed, subalpine meadow in Colorado, where weather data have been recorded for 38 years. I discovered that insect abundance declined an average of 6.6% annually, yielding a 72.4% decline over this 20-year period. According to model selection following information theoretic analysis of 59 combinations of weather-related factors, a seasonal increase in insect abundance changed to a seasonal decline as the previous summer's temperatures increased. This resulted in a long-term decline associated with increasing summer temperatures, particularly daily lows, which have increased 0.8°C per decade. However, other factors, such as ecological succession and atmospheric elevation in nitrogen and carbon, are also plausible drivers. In a relatively pristine ecosystem, insects are declining precipitously, auguring poorly for this and other such ecosystems that depend on insects in food webs and for pollination, pest control, and nutrient cycling. Addressing methane emission feedbacks from global wetlands, Ury et al., Nature Sustainability Earth-system feedback loops that exacerbate climate warming cause concern for both climate accounting and progress towards meeting international climate agreements. Methane emissions from wetlands are on the rise owing to climate change—a large and difficult-to-abate source of greenhouse gas that may be considered indirectly anthropogenic. Here we illustrate the power of emissions reduction from any sector for slowing the progress of earth-system feedbacks.

Full Content:
A critical ocean upwelling event in the Gulf of Panama has failed for the first time in at least 40 years. This seasonal process, which brings cold, nutrient-rich water to the surface, did not occur in early 2025. The immediate cause was a dramatic and unusual reduction in the northern trade winds. Scientists from the SmithsonianÂ Tropical Research Institute directly link this failure to a disruption in the global climate system. The ecological and economic consequences are severe. The failure disrupts the entire marine food web, leading to reduced fish catches that threaten local livelihoods and increase the risk of coral bleaching due to higher water temperatures. The event is a stark warning of the vulnerability of fundamental natural systems. It demonstrates how climate change can rapidly alter stable oceanic processes that humanity has long taken for granted. The drought affecting the Panama Canal is also linked to this climate disruption. Reduced rainfall in the Gulf of Panama region, which feeds the canal's watershed, has caused water shortages, leading to shipping restrictions and global supply chain delays.

Reduced rainfall in the Gulf of Panama region, which feeds the canal's watershed, has caused water shortages, leading to shipping restrictions and global supply chain delays. A vital ocean process that has sustained Panama's Pacific coast for generations has abruptly vanished, according to a new scientific report.Â For the first time in at least four decades,Â the seasonal upwelling event that cools the Gulf of Panama and nourishes its prolific marine life failed to occur in early 2025. Scientists from the Smithsonian Tropical Research InstituteÂ (STRI) who documented the event, point to a dramatic reduction in wind patterns as the immediate cause, warning that this unprecedented failure is a direct symptom of a disrupted global climate system with profound implications for fisheries, ecosystems and coastal economies. In simple terms, upwelling is an oceanographic process where powerful, consistent winds push surface water away from the coast. This action forces cold, dense water from the deep ocean to rise up and take its place. This deep water is incredibly rich in nutrients, acting as a natural fertilizer for the marine food web. (Related: Panama canal crisis: U.S. and China vie for control as Panamanians plead for American support.) For as long as modern records exist, this process has been a clockwork feature of the Gulf of Panama. Each year, from January through April, the northern trade winds blow across the region, triggering this massive nutrient pump. The result is an explosion of microscopic plant life or phytoplankton, which forms the base of a food chain that supports everything from tiny fish to large commercial fisheries. The consistency of this cycle has been a cornerstone of both the local ecosystem and the human communities that depend on it. The cold water brought up from the depths also serves a critical secondary function: It acts as a natural air conditioner for the ocean. By keeping sea temperatures lower during the Central American dry season, which coincides with the hottest months, this upwelling has historically helped protect fragile coral reefs from the thermal stress that causes deadly bleaching. The STRI research team has meticulously monitored this cycle for forty years. Their data paints a picture of a reliable, predictable natural system â but that reliability shattered in 2025. Their instruments detected none of the usual signs; the water temperature did not drop, and the nutrient levels did not spike. The biological productivity that should have marked the season was conspicuously absent. In a study published Sept. 2 in the prestigious journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the scientists directly link this failure to a significant and unusual reduction in the strength of the trade winds. While a single anomalous year does not, by itself, prove a long-term trend, researchers argue it reveals how fragile these fundamental oceanic processes are. The concern is that what was once an immutable law of nature in this region is now shown to be vulnerable. The event in Panama is being viewed as a potential early data point confirming those predictions, showing how quickly a stable system can be pushed out of balance. Implications for biodiversity and livelihoods The immediate consequences of a lost upwelling season are severe. Without the nutrient influx, the entire marine food web is disrupted. Fewer phytoplankton means less food for small fish, which in turn means less food for larger fish, seabirds, and marine mammals. This leads to reduced fish catches, threatening the livelihoods of local fishing communities that have depended on this seasonal bounty for millennia. Furthermore, the loss of the cooling effect places immense stress on coral reefs. Coral bleaching occurs when water temperatures become too high for too long, causing corals to expel the symbiotic algae that give them color and energy. Without this cooling upwelling, the reefs of the Gulf of Panama are left exposed to the full force of the sun, increasing the risk of widespread bleaching and the collapse of the intricate ecosystems they support. The failure of the Panama upwelling is not an isolated incident but a stark warning. It underscoresÂ an urgent global need to strengthen ocean-climate observation networks, particularly in the tropics, which are often the first to feel the impacts of a changing planet. It is a clear signal that systems humanity has taken for granted are now in flux. While upwelling brings cooler, nutrient-rich water, it is a separate issue from the drought currently impacting the canal's water supply. According to Brighteon.AI's Enoch, the canal's operations depend on freshwater from rainfall in Gatun Lake, not on seawater from the Gulf. Therefore, such an upwelling would not alleviate the drought conditions causing the current low water levels. The primary hydrological challenge for the canal remains the lack of precipitation in its watershed. Read more stories like this atÂ Climate.news.

Fewer phytoplankton means less food for small fish, which in turn means less food for larger fish, seabirds, and marine mammals. This leads to reduced fish catches, threatening the livelihoods of local fishing communities that have depended on this seasonal bounty for millennia. Furthermore, the loss of the cooling effect places immense stress on coral reefs. Coral bleaching occurs when water temperatures become too high for too long, causing corals to expel the symbiotic algae that give them color and energy. Without this cooling upwelling, the reefs of the Gulf of Panama are left exposed to the full force of the sun, increasing the risk of widespread bleaching and the collapse of the intricate ecosystems they support. The failure of the Panama upwelling is not an isolated incident but a stark warning. It underscoresÂ an urgent global need to strengthen ocean-climate observation networks, particularly in the tropics, which are often the first to feel the impacts of a changing planet. It is a clear signal that systems humanity has taken for granted are now in flux. While upwelling brings cooler, nutrient-rich water, it is a separate issue from the drought currently impacting the canal's water supply. According to Brighteon.AI's Enoch, the canal's operations depend on freshwater from rainfall in Gatun Lake, not on seawater from the Gulf. Therefore, such an upwelling would not alleviate the drought conditions causing the current low water levels. The primary hydrological challenge for the canal remains the lack of precipitation in its watershed. Read more stories like this atÂ Climate.news.

The cold water brought up from the depths also serves a critical secondary function: It acts as a natural air conditioner for the ocean. By keeping sea temperatures lower during the Central American dry season, which coincides with the hottest months, this upwelling has historically helped protect fragile coral reefs from the thermal stress that causes deadly bleaching. The STRI research team has meticulously monitored this cycle for forty years. Their data paints a picture of a reliable, predictable natural system â but that reliability shattered in 2025. Their instruments detected none of the usual signs; the water temperature did not drop, and the nutrient levels did not spike.

In a study published Sept. 2 in the prestigious journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the scientists directly link this failure to a significant and unusual reduction in the strength of the trade winds. While a single anomalous year does not, by itself, prove a long-term trend, researchers argue it reveals how fragile these fundamental oceanic processes are.

Title: Victorian kiosk’s restoration costs in Blackrock reaches €1.1m

The cost of restoring a Victorian kiosk at the main entrance to Blackrock Park in Dublin has been put at €1.1 million by Dún Laoghaire Rathdown Council, which said the building will open as a coffee shop in the coming months. The original 2024 tender submitted by the contractor that carried out the work, Bracegrade, was for €690,000, excluding VAT, but a contingency of €150,000 was approved at the same time by the council bringing the overall project cost to some €840,000. In response to a Freedom of Information request, it said an additional €200,000 was sought and approved in January of this year to fund the demolition of an existing but disused public toilet block and construction of a new facility close to the restored tea rooms. Some additional landscaping was also to be carried out. In the end, it said, €1.1 million has been spent to date on the project, which got under way in July of last year and is said to have been completed last month. A tender process was conducted to find a tenant for the tea rooms, which are a short walk from Blackrock village and two substantial shopping centres, and a contract has been provisionally agreed with operator of the Mister Magpie outlets in Ballsbridge and Leeson St. The contracts are currently being completed and the council said the facility will open in the coming months. “We are working closely with the operator to ensure the Tearooms open to the public as soon as possible,” the council said in a statement. [ ‘I can’t believe we’re living here’: Historic Wexford cottage that was at risk of falling into decline is restoredOpens in new window ] The small building, which was a protected structure, was originally built in the 1890s when it operated as a cake and sweet shop. The wider park had been established about 20 years earlier. The kiosk has views over much of it and Dublin Bay. The intention, it is stated, was to “faithfully restore” the building. Internal council documents suggest the tender process was conducted on the cascade basis, under which some potential bidders can be excluded if they are now considered suitable for some of the specialised work involved. The council said the process was “thorough and competitive” and the work carried out included considerable replacement of the building’s fabric, the installation of new windows and landscaping of the surrounding area. A number of grants were received to support the funding of the project including from the Department of Housing, local Government and Heritage’s Historic Structures Fund. Blackrock-based councillor Martha Fanning said that “having been vacant for decades, it’s wonderful to see the refurbishment being completed”. “Restoration works are expensive but the kiosk is a key historic feature of the park which shouldn’t have been allowed get into such a poor state of disrepair.” Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Sign up for push alerts to get the best breaking news, analysis and comment delivered directly to your phone Listen to In The News podcast daily for a deep dive on the stories that matter © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Jack O’Donoghue excited to work with Clayton McMillan as new season offers fresh start

Younger players starting out on their professional rugby career are like sponges and eager to learn. Older, or more experienced players, are perhaps more in need of a fresh voice and new ideas. It’s almost hard to credit that Jack O’Donoghue is now 31 and is now in the former category. But, while hardly in the veteran stakes just yet, the Waterford backrower endorses the clear feeling that the Munster squad have embraced Clayton McMillan’s messaging and ideas. “People have been itching to get to work with him,” says O’Donoghue. “When they announced it, I think everyone started tuning into Chiefs games, seeing how they play and getting a flavour for types of players he likes to pick. “From the preseason he set the stall out and there’s been a great mood and a great energy around the place and we’re really excited,” adds O’Donoghue, ahead of Friday’s preseason friendly at Virgin Media Park against Bath (kick-off 7pm). “His mission statement is about holding on to the ball, playing the opportunity that’s in front of you, but not necessarily overplaying. “If the kick is on or if it’s on to get the ball out wide, if that’s the right play, that’s it and you back it and you go with that.” That said, through little fault of their own, it’s a measure of the tumult at Munster that, entering O’Donoghue’s 12th season since breaking the team in 2014, McMillan is the sixth coach he’ll serve under. Munster host Bath in a preseason friendly in Musgrave Park on Friday (kick-off 7pm) and Johann van Graan has enhanced his reputation at the Rec since inheriting a squad at the foot of the Premiership three seasons ago and leading them to their first domestic title in 29 years last May. [ Clayton McMillan expects new leaders to emerge as he puts his stamp on MunsterOpens in new window ] Helpfully, Mike Prendergast, Denis Leamy and Mossy Lawlor have remained in place, but another period of stability akin to van Graan’s five years at Munster would be welcome. “Yeah, a bit of continuity, long-term, looking big picture, that’s something I presume the board, the IRFU are certainly looking at it,” says O’Donoghue. “It’s certainly above the players’ pay grade but that’s something as players you want to see.” McMillan has also brought with him a new Head of Athletic Performance Brad Mayo from New Zealand, as well as Martyn Vercoe as the new team manager, and the new voices have also implemented some modified preseason training which O’Donoghue has described as old school, notably a preseason camp in Rockwell, “back in the dorms and back to Munster Under-20 and Under-18s days”. After “a bit of a clean-up job on my ankle in the off-season” O’Donoghue bulked up in the gym and his enthusiasm for the new campaign was further whetted by the preseason. “We went boxing, hill running, swimming, different varieties of training. We’re not just out on the field constantly, but that just keeps the bit of drive there and stuff like that. “It’s not going to be like, ‘oh, let’s just come back out on the field now to run sprints’. It’s different every day. And that variety certainly was infectious throughout the group. “Some lads hated the swimming, some lads hated the hills, but I think it just kept everyone on their toes. And while some people were really good at the swimming, other people were really good at boxing, there was always one that you found yourself that you could excel on and probably step up in terms of leadership and stuff like that.” McMillan is big into Munster connecting with their people, and there was also a training camp in Ennis, with one in Kerry next week and O’Donoghue’s native Waterford also planned. As someone who has regularly stepped in as captain, O’Donoghue acknowledges there is an onus on him as well as others, to fill the void left by the retirement/departures of Peter O’Mahony, Conor Murray and Stephen Archer. Munster were playing catch-up after losing four of their first six URC matches before the November break last season, only securing a place in the play-offs and this season’s Champions Cup with a last-day win over Benetton. Mindful of this, O’Donoghue says they are looking no further than targeting their initial five-game block before the autumn series this season, namely Scarlets (away), Cardiff (home), Edinburgh (home), Leinster (away) and Connacht (home). However, while he maintains “Europe” has not been discussed, this Friday’s game is a foretaste of Munster’s opening Champions Cup game away to Bath while the ensuing round two game against Gloucester will be at Pairc Ui Chaoimh. “I only went on to purchase a few extra tickets myself and I saw the Blackrock end was sold out and only the two terraces were available. So that’s unbelievable. I think that certainly adds to the excitement that’s going to be building around this season. “And I think the launch of the jersey alone, the talk around that, going back to the ‘06 kind of bit of a twang on it, it’s really nice,” O’Donoghue adds of this season’s new jersey. “The white away jersey, there’s a lot of chat around us at the moment and that’s great, but we have to deliver on the field and that’s all that we’re kind of focusing on.” Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date What’s making headlines in the rugby world?

Title: Rumors Of BlackRock Buying XRP Via Coinbase Makes Waves. Is An XRP ETF Filing Coming?
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-xrp-buy-via-coinbase/
Time Published: 2025-09-11T03:00:05Z

The Ripple community is once again caught up in speculation after data showed a steep drop in Coinbase’s XRP holdings. Instead of seeing it as a sell-off, some commentators believe the decline could be linked to BlackRock quietly moving into position through Coinbase Custody. The rumors are persistent, even though BlackRock has already shot down earlier claims about a Spot XRP ETF filing. Nonetheless, this has left many to wonder if there’s more happening behind the scenes than the company is willing to admit. Recent on-chain data revealed that Coinbase’s XRP stash has decreased drastically since the second quarter of 2025. This decrease has seen the amount of coins held by Coinbase fall from 780.13 million to about 199 million, with a 57% fall in August alone. Considering the scale of this decline, the movement has stirred up different rumors. Some investors are of the notion that these are actually intended sell-offs by Coinbase, while others are of the notion that they are only strategic transfers involving institutions. Crypto analyst Crypto X AiMan addressed the situation in a video posted on the social media platform X, where he noted that Coinbase is not dumping the coin, despite claims circulating within the community. According to the analyst, the reduction is more likely linked to BlackRock, and his team had previously highlighted multiple BlackRock-XRP connections. As such, he admonished investors not to interpret the drop in Coinbase’s wallets as bearish but rather as a sign of shifting custody arrangements, possibly connected to the world’s largest asset manager. Comments about BlackRock’s interest in the digital asset are growing louder each day, but it is worth noting that the company has already denied reports of filing for a Spot XRP ETF. A company spokesperson for BlackRock recently clarified that no such product has been filed with the SEC. Nevertheless, the decrease in Coinbase’s wallets coincides with recent developments involving BlackRock’s partnership with Coinbase, which suggests that an official move relating to a Spot XRP ETF could be in the works. Given BlackRock’s embrace of other crypto ETFs, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, it is only a matter of time before the altcoin joins the lineup. Although BlackRock has not confirmed any intentions, the rumors alone have increased interest among many holders, as shown by comments on social media. As many as eight other asset managers have filed for a Spot XRP ETF with the SEC, and many investors are still anticipating that a formal filing might arrive sooner than expected. At the time of writing, the connection between Coinbase’s reduced holdings and BlackRock is speculative, but as the third-largest crypto by market cap, the idea of Spot XRP ETFs hitting the market soon should not be ruled out.

The decisions postponed BlackRock's Ethereum staking proposal alongside Franklin Templeton's spot XRP and Solana ETF applications. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delayed decisions on three crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on Sept. 10. The decisions postponed BlackRock’s Ethereum staking proposal alongside Franklin Templeton’s spot XRP and Solana ETF applications. The delays come as the SEC develops a generic listing framework that could streamline future crypto ETF approvals. The postponements position these applications for potential approval during an anticipated October batch decision window, aligning with previous predictions. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart noted in April that crypto ETFs would likely get a batch of approvals in October, when some of the over 90 filings reach their final deadlines. The SEC has been working with US exchanges on a standardized listing framework for token-based ETFs that would eliminate individual rule-change requests for qualifying assets. The initiative would allow ETF sponsors to bypass the customary Form 19b-4 process when underlying tokens meet predetermined criteria. Under the proposed framework, sponsors would submit registration statements on Form S-1, observe standard 75-day review periods, and list products once the waiting periods have ended. Market capitalization, on-exchange trading volume, and daily liquidity represent key metrics under discussion for qualification thresholds. The current rule-change pathway requires each spot crypto ETF to secure a Commission order before listing, a process designed for novel or complex products.

Eric Balchunas said on Sept. 9 that the “memecoin ETF era [is] about to kick off” with a Dogecoin ETF slated for launch on Sept. 11 under the 40 Act structure. Balchunas said this could potentially become “the first-ever US ETF to hold something that has no utility on purpose,” considering Dogecoin was originally created as a tribute to the Doge meme. A successful Dogecoin ETF launch could catalyze broader approval momentum for pending applications. Seyffart previously shared that there are 92 crypto ETF applications divided across various assets, including Solana, XRP, Litecoin, and staking versions of existing products awaiting SEC decisions. The comprehensive filing list reveals applications from major issuers, including VanEck, Grayscale, Canary, Bitwise, and Franklin Templeton, covering assets ranging from established cryptocurrencies to emerging tokens.

Title: Klarna surges 14.6% in NYSE debut as Buy Now Pay Later giant goes public

Time Published: 2025-09-10T22:36:35Z
Full Content:
UPDATED 18:36 EDT / SEPTEMBER 10 2025 by Duncan Riley Shares in Klarna Group PLC closed up 14.6% in regular trading today after the Swedish fintech company made its debut on the New York Stock Exchange. In its initial public offering, Klarna offered around 34.3 million shares at $40 each, raising about $1.4 billion. The shares opened at $52 each before surging to a high of $57, closing the day at $45.82. Founded in 2005, Klarna offers a “buy now, pay later” service that allows consumers to make online purchases and pay for them in installments, often with no interest over a short period, such as with its “Pay in 4” model. Klarna acts as an intermediary, paying the merchant upfront and then managing consumer payments, effectively removing risk for both parties and simplifying the checkout process. In addition to BNPL offerings, Klarna provides a suite of payment processing services for e-commerce merchants, handling customer payments, managing store claims and disputes. Since obtaining a banking license in Sweden in 2017, the company has also offered broader fintech offerings, including issuing physical and digital cards, providing savings accounts and offering subscription based services. In its IPO filing in March, Klarna said that more than 675,000 merchants have adopted its service to date and that those companies use Klarna to process payments for 93 million customers. The platform’s gross merchandise value, the combined dollar value of the transactions it processes, reached $105 billion last year. Klarna’s revenue rose 24% year-over-year, to $2.81 billion in 2024, and the company generated $21 million in net income. As reported by Bloomberg, the company’s closing price gives Klarna a market value of more than $17 billion, based on outstanding shares, a not unreasonable figure but notably down from a valuation of $45.6 billion the company reached on paper in a $639 million round in June 2021 during the COVID-19 online shopping boom. A subsequent private funding round of $800 million in 2022 saw Klarna’s valuation drop to $6.7 billion. Coming into its IPO, Klarna had raised $4.19 billion over 20 rounds, according to data from Tracxn. Investors in the company included Sequoia Capital Operations, Silver Lake Management, Adit Ventures, WestCap Management, Founders Fund Management, SoftBank Vision Fund LP, Dragoneer Investing Group, Technology Crossover Ventures LP, Macy’s Inc., BlackRock Inc., Visa Inc. and Ant Group Co. Ltd. Klarna’s successful IPO follows a recent run of strong tech-related IPOs, including Figma Inc. in July and Firefly Aerospace Inc. in August. The positive results have also seen more companies line up to go public after a near drought in IPOs over the COVID period amid market uncertainty. Earlier this week, Netskope Inc. and StubHub Inc. disclosed that they had filed for IPOs, while Infleqtion Inc. and CoinShares International Ltd. are opting to go public via mergers with special-purpose acquisition companies.

The SEC extended its deadline for addressing a rule change request by the Nasdaq exchange for staking in the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) to October 30, a 45-day postponement from its original schedule. It also pushed back its decision on 19b-4 rule change filings by Cboe that would allow the listing of the Franklin Templeton Solana ETF and Franklin Templeton XRP ETF to November 14, a 60-day deferral. The latest filings follow a slew of SEC delays in recent weeks on proposals for altcoin funds. On Tuesday, the regulator put off ruling on Nasdaq’s bid to list the Grayscale Hedera Trust to November 12, also 60 days. Last month, the SEC also held up resolving a request to add staking to the the 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF, which tracks the price of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value. At that time, it also moved back its decision on an application by Donald Trump's media and technology company by 45 days to Oct. 8 for a Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF that would track the two largest cryptocurrencies by market value. And it announced identical delays for applications filed for spot XRP funds by Grayscale, CoinShares, Canary Capital, Bitwise, and 21Shares, a spot Dogecoin ETF from Grayscale, and a spot Litecoin product from CoinShares. The dates for potential approvals of those funds vary. Those announcements followed delayed decisions on Solana ETFs from Bitwise, 21Shares, and VanEck, and a Dogecoin fund from 21Shares. Before August ended, the SEC was weighing 90 crypto ETF applications, which spanned a range of assets. Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas told Decrypt that the latest delays were consistent with the regulator's recent approach, likely timing approvals of proposed altcoin ETFs and Ethereum staking after likely green-lighting proposals filed in July by Cboe and NYSE. Those exchanges asked the SEC to approve amendments that could significantly shorten the approval process for future crypto exchange-traded funds, automatically listing certain products without requiring case-by-case filings. In separate filings, the exchanges requested changes to their listing standards that would allow certain crypto ETFs to be listed without enduring the SEC's rigorous evaluation, a process that requires exchanges to submit proposed rule changes. Under current guidelines, reviews of proposed changes to funds could take 240 days. "They've been punting and punting [...] and we expect them to keep putting everything off until the generic listing standards are done," Balchunas said. "That is what we think will happen, probably in early October. After that, we expect a flood of ETFs probably in a couple months." He added: "We expect ETH staking to be part of it. This SEC showed every sign of being interested in working with the issuers and solving problems." Bloomberg analysts have predicted a more than 95% probability of Solana and XRP ETFs receiving approval this year. Balchunas described the odds on staking as "pretty high," as well. "We think they'll allow that, too," he said.

Title: 20-year-old fintech Klarna finally went public. Here's who's getting rich.
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/klarna-ipo-stock-price-investors-2025-9
Time Published: 2025-09-10T21:02:10Z

Two decades after its founding, Klarna has gone public, and its investors are finally seeing a windfall. The Swedish "buy now, pay later" company listed on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday. Its stock popped 30% on its debut, jumping above its $40-per-share IPO price to $52 a share. That IPO price gave Klarna a $15.1 billion valuation and netted Klarna $1.37 billion. Per Pitchbook, Klarna had raised $3.85 billion in its history before the public listing. Klarna's IPO has been a long time coming. Founded in 2005, the consumer payments company first hinted at an IPO in 2019, telling Bloomberg it could go public in the next one to two years. Klarna had reportedly planned to go public earlier this year, but delayed its IPO efforts after Trump's Liberation Day tariffs roiled the markets. It's the first major IPO of the fall and is expected to be one of many companies to take the public market plunge before the end of the year. Gemini Space Station, a crypto exchange backed by the billionaire Winklevoss twins, is expected to go public later this week, and 25-year-old ticket marketplace StubHub launched its IPO roadshow Monday. Klarna's IPO price represents a major markdown from its peak valuation, however. The company raised $639 million in 2021 at a $45.6 billion valuation, but slashed its valuation a stunning 85% to $6.7 billion the next year as the fintech sector stumbled on rising interest rates and worsening investor sentiment. Klarna chairperson and former Sequoia Capital Michael Moritz criticized the company's other investors at the time. "The shift in Klarna's valuation is entirely due to investors suddenly voting in the opposite manner to the way they voted for the past few years. The irony is that Klarna's business, its position in various markets, and its popularity with consumers and merchants are all stronger than at any time since Sequoia first invested in 2010," Moritz said in a press release about the round. "Eventually, after investors emerge from their bunkers, the stocks of Klarna and other first-rate companies will receive the attention they deserve." Klarna debuts on the US market facing a number of headwinds, including regulatory risks and widening losses as the company sets aside more capital to cover potential losses if its customers don't pay back their loans. It's been making changes to its operations, too. Klarna will require many of its previously remote employees to return to the office three days a week beginning at the end of September, in part due to Klarna losing talent to firms that prioritize in-person working, Business Insider reported last week. Klarna is also redirecting multiple employees to customer support positions after previously restructuring the business to prioritize AI chatbots handling its customer service. Klarna declined to comment for this story. We used Klarna's share price at Wednesday's market close, $45.82, to determine the value of its major shareholders' stakes after the listing. We're including the 15 shareholders with the largest stakes after Klarna's IPO. Venture firm IVP, Ant Group, and Harvest Growth Capital, other investors in Klarna listed in its IPO filing, were among the top 15 shareholders prior to Klarna's IPO, but sold enough shares in the listing to fall in the rankings. Our calculations included any extra shares that shareholders offered to meet higher investor demand. Now that Klarna is public, here's what those top 15 shareholders' stakes are worth. Venture capital giant Sequoia Capital is the biggest benefactor of Klarna's IPO. The San Francisco-based firm Sequoia owned 78.8 million shares, or about 20.1% of the company, after its IPO. Sequoia first invested in Klarna in 2010, leading the company's $9 million fundraise and contributing additional capital over numerous rounds in the following years. Former Sequoia partner Michael Moritz joined Klarna's board of directors at the firm's 2010 investment and became the chairperson of the board in 2020. When Moritz stepped down from his investing position in 2023, Sequoia partner Matthew Morris joined Klarna's board to represent the firm. The following year, Morris, with Sequoia's backing, reportedly attempted to remove Moritz from the board altogether. After facing pushback from Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski, Morris withdrew the attempt and stepped down from the board. Sequoia partner Andrew Reed took his place. Moritz remains Klarna's chairperson today. "It's amazing what an iron-willed CEO like [Sebastian Siemiatkowski], an enduring value prop, a team of true believers, and 20 years of steady (ish?) compounding can create," Reed posted on X Wednesday morning. Sequoia bought an additional 7.33 million shares in Klarna between July 2022 and March 2023 for $135 million, according to Klarna's IPO filing. Sequoia sold 2.14 million shares in Klarna's IPO, which at its $40-per-share IPO price netted the firm $85.6 million. At a $45.82 closing share price, Sequoia's remaining stake is worth about $3.5 billion. Klarna cofounder Victor Jacobsson owned about 30 million shares of Klarna, or 8% of the company after its IPO. Jacobsson founded Klarna in 2005 alongside Sebastian Siemiatkowski and Niklas Adalberth. He served as the company's CFO until 2012, when he left. Jacobsson and Siemiatkowski, Klarna's CEO and the only cofounder who remains an executive at the company, have reportedly clashed in private for years over key governance decisions at Klarna, like how and when the company should go public. Jacobsson has amassed a large stake in Klarna over the years, including by buying up shares in secondary markets through various holding companies, the Financial Times previously reported. Between July 2022 and March 2023, Jacobsson bought nearly 4 million shares of Klarna for a total of $73 million across four different holding companies, per Klarna's IPO filing. Jacobsson sold about 1.3 million shares in Klarna's IPO, which at a $40-per-share IPO price would've netted him about $52.1 million. At a $45.82 share price, Jacobsson's remaining stake is worth about $1.38 billion. Heartland A/S, the investment holding company owned by Danish billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen, owned about 37.1 million shares of Klarna, or about 7.8% of the company after its IPO. Heartland first invested in Klarna in 2017 via Brightfolk A/S, another of Holch Povlsen's holding companies. That investment included shares bought from existing Klarna investors such as private equity firm General Atlantic and cofounder Niklas Adalberth. Heartland CEO Lise Kaae sits on Klara's board of directors. The firm sold about 7.4 million shares in Klarna's IPO, or about 20% of its stake. At a $40-per-share IPO price, that sale brought in about $297 million. At a $45.82 share price, Heartland's remaining stake is worth about $1.36 billion. Sebastian Siemiatkowski, Klarna's CEO and cofounder, owned 25.6 million shares of Klarna, or about 6.8% after its IPO. Siemiatkowski began building Klarna alongside his cofounders at age 23, while he was getting his master's degree at the Stockholm School of Economics. The company, initially named Kreditor and rebranded to Klarna in 2010, sought to allow customers to pay for their purchases after delivery. Siemiatkowski was estimated to be a billionaire in early 2022, with his net worth peaking at roughly $3.2 billion after Klarna raised a funding round the previous year at a $45.6 billion valuation. The company's fundraise in July 2022, however, valued Klarna at $6.7 billion, knocking Siemiatkowski off the billionaire pedestal. Klarna paid $16.5 million to nonprofits founded by Siemiatkowski's wife, including through donations and partnerships, over the last five years, BI reported last week. Siemiatkowski purchased an additional 3.06 million shares of Klarna for $56 million between July 2022 and March 2023. He's the only major shareholder on this list who didn't sell any of his shares in Klarna's IPO. At a $45.82 price, his stake is now worth about $1.17 billion. The Commonwealth Bank of Australia owned about 19.3 million shares of Klarna, or about 4.6% of the company after its IPO. CBA, the largest bank in Australia by total assets, first invested $100 million in Klarna in 2019. It's also backed Anthropic, announcing an investment in the AI startup giant in March. CBA invested an additional $200 million in Klarna in 2020, bringing its stake to 5.5%. As part of its investments in Klarna, CBA received 50-50 ownership rights with Klarna to Klarna's Australian and New Zealand business. CBA bought an additional 1.8 million shares in Klarna between July 2022 and March 2023, according to Klarna's IPO filing, for an aggregate price of $32 million. CBA sold about 1.9 million shares in Klarna's IPO, which at the $40-per-share IPO price would've brought in $77.4 million. At a $45.82 share price, its remaining stake is worth about $798 million. Private equity firm Silver Lake owned 17 million shares of Klarna, or about 3.8% of the company after its IPO. The Silicon Valley-based firm's other tech bets include fintech darling Stripe, business-management software company Airtable, and weight-care app Noom. Silver Lake led Klarna's $650 million fundraise in 2020, which valued the company at $10.6 billion. The firm sold about 2.6 million shares in Klarna's IPO, netting it $102 million at a $40 IPO share price. At $45.82 a share, Silver Lake's remaining stake is worth about $663 million. Singaporean sovereign wealth fund GIC Private Limited owned about 6.3 million shares of Klarna, or about 1.4% after its IPO. The fund manages Singapore's foreign reserves in more than 40 countries. It's also invested in Anthropic, contributing to its September $13 billion Series F fundraise at an $183 billion valuation. GIC invested in Klarna's $650 million round in 2020 at a $10.6 billion valuation. The fund sold about 1.2 million shares in Klarna's IPO, netting it $46.9 million at a $40 IPO share price. At a $45.82 share price, GIC's remaining stake is worth about $236 million. San Francisco-based investment firm HMI Capital owned about 5.6 million shares in Klarna, or about 1.2% of the company after its IPO. HMI Capital manages about $3.22 billion in assets, primarily making investments in public companies including Roblox, Flutter Entertainment, and SailPoint. The firm first invested in Klarna in 2019, contributing to its $460 million fundraise. HMI Capital put more money into the company in its 2020, 2021, and 2022 raises. "From the outset, we believed that their vision of buy-now-pay-later offers a cheaper, friendlier alternative to credit cards. Klarna has proven that by welcoming over 110 million active consumers to its platform," said Justin Nyweide, founding partner and CIO of HMI Capital, in a statement to BI. "We particularly want to congratulate CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski, Chairperson Michael Moritz and CFO Niclas Neglén for successfully bringing Klarna to market in a turbulent time. We are proud to partner with them and can't wait for Klarna to tackle the immense growth opportunity in front of them." HMI Capital sold 1.1 million shares in Klarna's IPO, which at a $40-per-share IPO price would've brought in $44.5 million. At a $45.82 share price, its remaining stake is worth about $204 million. BlackRock owned nearly 6 million shares of Klarna, or about 1.1% of the company after its IPO. BlackRock has invested hundreds of billions of dollars in Big Tech giants including Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple. It's also backed AI data processing startup Databricks, which announced a $1 billion fundraise this week at a $100 billion valuation. The firm first invested in Klarna in 2019, contributing to its $460 million fundraise, and putting more capital into the company in its 2020 and 2021 raises. BlackRock sold about 1.7 million shares in Klarna's IPO. At a $40 IPO share price, that sale would've netted the firm $68.5 million. At a $45.82 share price, BlackRock's remaining stake is worth about $194 million. UBS O'Connor owned about 4.5 million shares in Klarna, or about .9% of the company after its IPO. UBS O'Connor is an alternative investment unit within UBS Asset Management. Per Klarna's IPO filing, its Klarna investment is held in the Nineteen77 funds that UBS manages. It's not clear when UBS O'Connor first invested in Klarna. The fund did participate in Klarna's $800 million Series H fundraise in 2022, per UBS. In May, UBS said it would sell its O'Connor unit, which had roughly $11 billion under management at the time, to Cantor Fitzgerald. That acquisition hasn't yet closed. UBS and Cantor Fitzgerald declined to confirm whether O'Connor's stake in Klarna will be assumed by Cantor Fitzgerald when the deal closes. UBS O'Connor sold about 1.3 million shares in Klarna's IPO, which, at a $40-per-share price, would have brought in about $52.3 million. At a $45.82 share price, its remaining stake is worth about $148 million. Sovereign wealth fund Mubadala Investment Company owned about 5.4 million shares of Klarna, or about .8% of the company after its IPO. Mubadala invests in companies in the United Arab Emirates and abroad on behalf of the government of Abu Dhabi. It's backed a number of top private companies, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Databricks, and healthcare IPO hopeful Zelis Healthcare. Mubadala invested in Klarna in 2022 as part of the company's $800 million fundraise. Mubadala sold 2.3 million shares in Klarna's IPO, representing about 43% of its holdings. At a $40-per-share IPO price, that sale would net the firm about $93.8 million. At a $45.82 share price, its remaining stake is worth $141 million. Skandia owned about 4.1 million shares of Klarna, or about .8% of the company after its IPO. The Swedish insurance and financial services company first invested in Klarna in 2015, when it bought a roughly 1% stake. Skandia sold about 1.2 million shares in Klarna's IPO, representing nearly 30% of its stake in the company. At a $40-per-share IPO price, that sale netted Skandia about $47.7 million. At Klarna's $45.82 closing share price, Skandia's remaining stake is worth about $135 million. Niklas Adalberth, Klarna's third cofounder, owned about 2.9 million shares of Klarna, or about .7% of the company after its IPO. That's the sum of shares held by Adalberth himself and by Sunnersta Invest AB, Adalberth's private investment company. Adalberth used to own about 8% of Klarna. But after Adalberth stepped down as Klarna's deputy CEO and left the company in 2015, he sold all but .75% of his stake to fund his philanthropy and impact investing. Adalberth told BI in 2021 that he left Klarna after reevaluating his priorities, including his feelings toward wealth and consumption. Adalberth sold about 273,000 shares in Klarna's IPO, netting him about $11.7 million at a $40 share price. At $45.82 a share, Adalberth's remaining stake is worth $121 million. London-based venture firm Atomico owned about 3.6 million shares of Klarna, or nearly .7% of the company after its IPO. Started in 2006 by Skype cofounder Niklas Zennström, Atomico has backed some VC heavy-hitters, including fintech giant Stripe and physical therapy company Hinge Health, which went public earlier this year. Atomico first invested in Klarna in 2012, buying shares from an existing investor in a secondary sale worth $14 million. "Over 13 years of partnership with Sebastian and his team, we've seen economic downturns, market turbulence, and inflationary pressures, yet Klarna's business model has always proven remarkably resilient," Zennström said in a statement to BI. "That ability to scale faster while running leaner is unparalleled, and it's a model more companies and founders across Europe will seek to emulate." Atomico sold just over a million shares of Klarna in its IPO. At a $40-per-share IPO price, that sale netted Atomico $41.5 million. At a $45.82 share price, Atomico's remaining stake is worth about $118 million. SEB, short for Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, is a Stockholm-based bank. SEB owned about 2.4 million shares of Klarna, or roughly .6% of the company after its IPO. SEB began working with Klarna in 2012, when Klarna partnered with SEB on its Klarna Checkout platform for merchants. (Klarna sold Klarna Checkout in 2024.) SEB's pension funds also contributed tens of millions of dollars to Norrsken VC, Adalberth's impact fund, in 2020 and 2021. SEB told BI that its stake in Klarna, as listed in the company's IPO filing, is "kept in custody on behalf of clients." The bank declined to comment further. SEB sold about 23,000 shares in Klarna's IPO, which at the $40-per-share IPO price would net the firm about $937,000. At a $45.82 closing share price, SEB's remaining share is worth about $110 million. Jump to

Leah Wald emphasized that treasury companies must operate respectfully to maintain industry credibility while benefiting from expanding product availability. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. SOL Strategies CEO Leah Wald outlined how Solana-focused digital asset treasury companies can drive institutional adoption and exchange-traded fund (ETF) flows. In an interview with CryptoSlate, Wald noted that multiple Solana treasury companies create a “rising tide” effect similar to Bitcoin miners benefiting alongside Bitcoin ETF inflows. She noted the parallel between Bitcoin ecosystem dynamics, where miners receive inflows alongside spot and futures ETFs, suggesting similar potential for Solana-focused companies. Wald explained: “You’ve always seen that in the past where miners get inflows, like Bitcoin miners. ETF gets inflows alongside Bitcoin spot and Bitcoin futures ETFs get inflows.” She described the phenomenon as retail investors choosing different products based on enthusiasm, while institutions prefer ETFs for tax advantages and custody structures. Wald acknowledged widespread market expectations for a spot or staked spot Solana ETF under a 33 Act wrapper, viewing this development as part of a broader rising tide of product offerings. She emphasized that treasury companies must operate respectfully to maintain industry credibility while benefiting from expanding product availability. Bloomberg ETF analysts expect an approval in October, when most of the spot Solana ETF filings will meet their final deadline with the SEC. Addressing concerns about digital asset treasury (DAT) company valuations, Wald acknowledged that many firms that added Bitcoin now trade at discounts to multiple of Bitcoin NAV (mNAV), including Bitcoin miners. A Sept. 2 report by Grayscale highlighted a decreasing mNAV for DAT companies, suggesting a cooling of interest from investors. However, she expressed confidence that SOL Strategies’ dual approach as both a technology company and treasury accumulator provides competitive advantages during market downturns. Wald stated: “It does not scare us. I think it positions us in a position of strength because we’re the only ones running a real business and it’s a business that continues to accumulate and compound.” She noted that discount trading environments place pressure on management teams to execute validator business models effectively rather than relying solely on asset appreciation.

Stay connected via SOL Strategies differentiates itself by calling the company “DAT plus plus,” emphasizing technology development alongside treasury accumulation. Wald described the firm as a technology company first, with treasury accumulation as a secondary function, contrasting with purely speculative treasury models. SOL Strategies added SOL to its treasury and started trading on Nasdaq on Sept. 9 under the ticker STKE. Despite being the second-largest decentralized ecosystem, with over $12 billion in total value locked, Solana still represents a small fraction of the tokenization landscape. Institutions deployed nearly $500 million using Solana’s infrastructure, representing 3.1% of this market. In comparison, Ethereum has a 52% dominance over tokenization efforts. Wald sees institutional treasury companies as catalysts for closing this gap through education and validation efforts. She explained: “I do think that any ETF, like any well-respected issuer or well-respected company, anyone that puts boots on the ground on education is only going to help Solana, the network, grow and succeed.” She emphasized validation and adoption benefits from proper educational initiatives about Solana’s technical advantages. Wald stressed the significant institutional interest, including BlackRock’s plans to launch a yield fund on Solana alongside existing tokenized products from Apollo and Franklin Templeton. She listed these developments as evidence of growing institutional recognition of Solana’s capabilities for tokenization and digital asset infrastructure. Wald concluded by positioning treasury companies as educational ambassadors for Solana’s institutional adoption journey: “It’s on all of us out there to educate why we think that it’s better, cheaper, faster, quicker, all those different merits to get there. Hopefully, with all the DAT leaders out there providing education, it should snowball.” Gino Matos is a law school graduate and a seasoned journalist with six years of experience in the crypto industry.

It's a drama that kicked off last week and has now reached a fevered pitch as some of the biggest crypto companies around compete for the highly sought-after USDH ticker—culminating in an on-chain vote by Hyperliquid stakeholders on Sunday. Major companies like Paxos, Sky, and Frax Finance have thrown their hats in the ring alongside Ethena, with backing from a BlackRock executive. And yet, it appears a new and relatively unknown team in Native Markets is the current frontrunner. Hyperliquid is a decentralized exchange, specializing in perpetual futures trading, that lives on its own dedicated layer-1 network by the same. At the time of writing, there’s roughly $5.84 billion in stablecoins on the network—the fifth largest total of all blockchains, per DefiLlama—with USDC accounting for 94.9% of the network’s stablecoins. Over the past 24 hours, it has been responsible for a whopping $1.076 billion in trading volume and has cemented itself as a crucial component in the on-chain economy. With its own stablecoin, Hyperliquid intends to circumvent the biggest players in the space, such as Circle’s USDC and Tether’s USDT, and secure for itself the lucrative yields these stablecoins generate. While no “special privileges” will be granted to the token, per the Hyperliquid Foundation, crypto heavyweights are now vying for the chance to control the USDH ticker. The Foundation has said the eventual stablecoin must be “Hyperliquid-first” and “Hyperliquid-aligned,” with many proposals creating frameworks that feed revenue back into the ecosystem in some way. Whoever eventually launches the USDH stablecoin would likely benefit immensely from the growing Hyperliquid community embracing the token as the stablecoin of the network. Hyperliquid validators, those responsible for securing the network, should state their voting intention by early Sunday, giving time for users to stake to a validator that matches their vote, before the winner of the USDH competition is formally decided that same day. Here are the issuers in contention to launch Hyperliquid’s USDH stablecoin: Founded specifically to “build the best stablecoin” for Hyperliquid, according to its Substack, Native Markets started work “months ago” and informed Hyperliquid Labs of its plans, inquiring about the USDH ticker. It proposes to create a stablecoin that will be GENIUS Act-compliant, referring to the landmark stablecoin legislation in the U.S. that President Donald Trump recently signed into law. It plans for Bridge—a platform acquired by payments giant Stripe in 2024—to manage its reserves. Native Markets says it will contribute half of the yield generated from those reserves towards USDH growth partnerships and the other half to the Assistance Fund, a protocol-driven buy back fund. “We are prepared to launch a community-aligned stablecoin within days,” Native Markets wrote on Substack on Monday. Already, a top Hyperliquid validator called CMI has stepped forward and shown support for the proposal. At the moment, market sentiment is placing Native Markets as the overwhelming favorite to win the bidding for the USDH ticker, though several leading figures in the crypto industry have come forward to suggest the organization has received an unfair advantage. Hyperliquid currently loses >$200m a year to firms who treat it as an afterthought at best. I'm co-founding Native Markets to reclaim this value leakage for the ecosystem and to kickstart Hyperliquid's next chapter. pic.twitter.com/oU6RYXE4E9 — max.hl (@fiege_max) September 8, 2025 Ethena notably entered the race on Tuesday, with backing from the biggest asset manager in the world, BlackRock. Ethena is the issuer of the third-largest stablecoin by market cap, USDE, per CoinGecko, behind only industry giants Tether and Circle. The proposal suggests that Ethena’s USDtb, which is the seventh-largest stablecoin, would back USDH, giving it indirect collateralization from BlackRock’s BUIDL fund—a tokenized money market fund. BlackRock’s head of digital assets, Robert Mitchnick, also provided a statement claiming the token would be “uniquely positioned to offer institutional-grade cash management.” On top of this, Ethena says 95% of revenue generated by its USDH reserves will be given to the Assistance Fund or used to purchase HYPE, the native token of the Hyperliquid network. It also suggests that Ethena would cover all transaction costs associated with making USDH the premier stablecoin for Hyperliquid—for example, the costs involved in denominating trading pairs on Hyperliquid in USDH instead of USDC. Established stablecoin company Paxos—issuer of PAX Gold, Global Dollar, and more—is also very much in the mix. Paxos’ proposal not only claims its token would be GENIUS-compliant but also adhere to global regulations, including Europe’s MiCA. It also proposes fiat onramps via SWIFT, ACH, and wire transfers, as well as plans to enable real-world payments for USDH. Plus, it would look to support Hyperliquid’s token on Paxos’ brokerage platform, which is used by PayPal, Venmo, and more. Finally, 95% of interest, not revenue, from the reserves backing USDH will be used to purchase HYPE and redistribute it to applications and validators. We've spent the last three days listening to the @HyperliquidX community, absorbed every concern and doubled down. V2 of our proposal is simple: @Paxos unlocks Hyperliquid at global scale 🌏 — bhau (@bhau___) September 10, 2025 Ethereum DeFi giant Sky, formerly known as MakerDAO, entered the USDH race on Monday. Sky is the issuer of the fourth-largest stablecoin by market cap, USDS, formerly known as DAI—which remains the largest decentralized stablecoin on the market. Sky’s proposal differs from the pack, suggesting USDH be natively multichain (that is, available on various blockchain networks simultaneously), powered by LayerZero, and flexes its security track record and risk management. Sky also says it will deploy part of its balance sheet into Hyperliquid, start buying HYPE with its profits, and grant a 4.85% return on USDH to the Hyperliquid community. USDH powered by Sky. • 4.85% rewards on all USDH on Hyperliquid• 2.2B USDC in instant redemption liquidity• $8B+ Sky balance sheet ready to deploy• Backed by Sky’s 7-year track record Read the proposal by @RuneKek ↓ https://t.co/WYkbHG9Bbc — Sky (@SkyEcosystem) September 8, 2025 Agora, issuers of AUSD, the 29th largest stablecoin by market cap, have directly called out Native Market’s reliance on Stripe, pointing to “clear conflicts” as Stripe builds out its own Tempo layer-1 network—suggesting that Stripe would rather push users onto Tempo than Hyperliquid. Agora proposes to take full control of the stablecoin issuance itself, boasting VanEck as its asset manager. It says it will share 100% of net revenue with the Assistance Fund or buy back HYPE, and like the rest, promises to be GENIUS-compliant. “We strongly urge caution against the utilization of Stripe (Bridge) as an issuer,” Nick van Eck, co-founder of Agora, wrote. “Running an institutional-grade, liquid stablecoin, at global scale is hard. We strongly urge the community to choose experienced partners that are set up for the long-term success of this initiative.” Proposal: Agora stablecoin infrastructure to power USDH with a coalition of best-in-class providers. IntroductionIf Hyperliquid relinquishes their canonical stablecoin to Stripe, a vertically integrated issuer with clear conflicts, what are we all even doing? Summary-… — Nick van Eck (@Nick_van_Eck) September 7, 2025 A mysterious proposal by Frax Finance suggests a “Frax-led alliance with a federally regulated U.S. bank issuer” to issue USDH. However, due to the short window and the legal implications, the proposal is unable to disclose the issuer’s name. That said, the proposal says that USDH will be backed one-for-one with U.S. treasuries via tokenized funds, will be GENIUS-compliant, and with the entire treasury yield returned to Hyperliquid in some way. There are many more proposals in the USDH hunt from lesser-known entities. One, for example, suggests that the USDH ticker should be burned to foster a true free-market environment. Another, very obviously a joke, is written by someone pretending to be the Hyperliquid co-founder and CEO, Jeff Yan, intentionally misspelling words in the Boden meme style and stating that “chart make zig-zag.” The other, more serious proposals include one from OpenEden, which will cycle 100% of its fees into buying HYPE and distributing it to network validators. To many, USDH mania has been the most exciting that on-chain governance has been in a long time. It all builds up to Sunday’s main event when Hyperliquid validators make their final votes.

But on Wednesday, the company successfully landed on the New York Stock Exchange, having raised $1.4 billion, largely for its existing investors, rather than itself. The fintech giant sold shares at $40, above its announced range of $35 to $37, and came out of the gate with a $15 billion valuation. Shares popped, opening at $52, though quickly settling down to around $46 mid-day. Of the 34.3 million shares Klarna sold, only 5 million were sold by the company, it said. The rest were sold by existing investors like the company’s largest shareholder Sequoia Capital. Entities controlled by Danish billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen, Silver Lake, BlackRock, and many others sold as well. Despite cashing out some shares, all of them are holding onto the majority of their stakes. Figma’s IPO did a similar thing. Yet, often these existing investors don’t want to sell at the IPO price, a VC told TechCrunch. They kick in shares to help the company meet IPO demand. Floating more shares helps the company obtain a more accurate, and perhaps higher, valuation out of the gate because it helps the IPO attract the biggest institutional investors who wouldn’t bother with an IPO for a small allocation. In Klarna’s case co-founder CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski did not sell any shares. His stake was worth $1.02 billion at the IPO selling price of $40 and he controls about 7.5% of the company. Victor Jacobsson, the co-founder who left the company in 2012, did sell but was, and still is, a slightly larger shareholder. He cashed out of 1.1 million shares and still retains over 8% of the company. Co-founder Niklas Adalberth still owns just under 3 million shares, Klarna disclosed. Sequoia is by far the biggest investor in Klarna, controlling nearly 23% of the company. Famed VC Michael Moritz wrote Klarna’s first check on Sequoia’s behalf in 2010, and stayed on as Klarna’s chairperson even after he left Sequoia in 2023. Some drama ensued when Sequoia added another member to Klarna’s board. But it eventually sorted itself out when Sequoia’s Andrew Reed joined its board in 2024.“This moment feels surreal,” Siemiatkowski shared in published remarks. “When we started Klarna back in 2005, it was just a wild idea — me, Niklas, and Victor, fumbling around, trying to make shopping and payments smoother for people. We got rejected left and right, laughed at more times than I can count. But we kept going.”He continued, “Going public in New York is huge. It’s not just a milestone; it’s a statement. It’s proof that a bunch of stubborn dreamers from Stockholm can take on the world — and win.” Interestingly, though, $1.4 billion is not the record for the biggest IPO of 2025. That’s still held by CoreWeave, which raised $1.5 billion in June. Correction: This story originally misidentified the nationality of Anders Holch Povlsen. That information has been updated.
