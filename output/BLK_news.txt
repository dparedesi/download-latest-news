Graduate workers and student groups across the US are mapping university ties to militarism and Israel’s war on Gaza. (Photo: Gaza Solidarity Encampment at Columbia University, April 2024) The explosion of campus protest movements against Israel’s siege of Gaza, especially during the April 2024 encampments, has been historic. These movements showed the whole world that swaths of young people across the U.S. stand in solidarity with Palestinians who are facing a genocidal assault. The encampments created crises for college administrators who purport to defend values of justice and human rights while also looking to appease their trustees and donor bases who back Israel’s brutal war. A generation has been galvanized and politicized, experiencing extreme repression for simply demanding their institutions cut ties with one of the great human catastrophes of modern times: Israel’s indiscriminate destruction of Gaza, the killing of tens of thousands of people and injuring of many more, the use of starvation as a weapon of war, and the annihilation of Gaza’s universities. A lesser known thread stretching across this campus upsurge has been the critical role of power research in supporting movement organizing, labor struggle, political education, and protest strategy. Across universities and colleges, grad workers and undergrad students have done the nitty-gritty work of digging into their endowment’s investments, researching the financial ties between the Pentagon and campus labs, and mapping out the connections between university trustees and the war machine. Not all this research is new. It builds on years of work by the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement and other campus divestment campaigns. But there’s no doubt that this moment, marked by a heightened awareness of the tight relationship between university power structures and the corporate-military-political bloc upholding occupation and apartheid against Palestinians, has generated new urgency in the longtime craft of mapping corporate power. These new research efforts that are unmasking university ties to militarism and war crimes are being carried out by union graduate workers from California to Michigan to Massachusetts who are organizing to stop the flow of their research — their labor — into military projects and military technology. They’re being done by undergrad organizers from New York to Rhode Island who are campaigning for divestment and building out power maps to illustrate university ties to weapons’ companies. These organizers are forming research committees and working collaboratively. They’re sharing findings and skills through teach-ins and meetings. They’re building national networks and communicating across geography through group chats and webinars. These new research efforts are also drawing direct inspiration from past models of campus power research — anti-South African apartheid campaigns of the 1980s, but especially from the 1968 pamphlet, “Who Rules Columbia?,” which mapped out the Columbia University power structure during that campus’s historic uprising against war and racism over five decades ago. Indeed, some campus researchers today are communicating with and learning directly from the veteran researchers who quite literally wrote “Who Rules Columbia?” Thus, grad workers and campus organizers for Palestine today are not merely doing research — they’re upholding and expanding a proud movement tradition of power research that stretches back to the the civil rights movements and the SNCC Research Department and to the Vietnam antiwar movement and National Action/Research on the Military-Industrial Complex (NARMIC). In charging forward with a new and broad effort to map out university power today, grad workers and campus organizers are also reviving an analysis of the militarized corporate university that was pioneered by activists in the 1960s and 1970s. This analysis understands the university not as a site of harmonious apprenticeship, but as an employer that relies on graduate labor to function everyday and to serve the imperatives of military production; not as an idyllic site of learning, but as a power structure governed by corporate elites, interlocked with influential blocs of capital stretching from finance to real estate to technology, with close ties to the war machine and with endowments that operate like hedge funds, ready to undermine its own purported values and students at the whims of wealthy donors and war industry partners. “The Beginning of the Military Supply Chain” As Israel’s siege of Gaza intensified in the fall of 2023, flattening and starving the enclave while killing tens of thousands of people, students across the U.S., from Stanford to NYU, began protesting to demand a ceasefire in Gaza and that their institutions divest from and break ties with Israel. Grad workers, as laborers within their universities, wondered how to respond. “A lot of the research workers and grad students here were really struggling to metabolize our grief and figure out what sort of interventions on behalf of Palestine we were positioned to make,” said Isabel Kain, a fourth-year union graduate worker in the Astronomy and Astrophysics department at at the University of California at Santa Cruz (UCSC). Specifically, Kain was thinking about the connections between her own workplace at UCSC and the war on Gaza. “The research that we do can go on to create the killing machines of tomorrow,” she said. “We are the very beginning of the military supply chain.” Universities are a critical part of the U.S. war machine. Billions of dollars from the Department of Defense flow annually into labs whose research findings advance weapons’ systems. University endowments invest in military-tied corporations and many university trustees are interlocked with war profiteers. “The U.S. military-industrial complex “could not function without American universities,” wrote Harry Zehner in the Nation. “It needs college-educated engineers and scientists. It relies on thousands of research projects, funded by the Pentagon and carried out by academics around the country.” Moreover, it relies on thousands of graduate workers and postdoctoral fellows to carry out the research labor and lab work behind those research projects. Heeding the call of Palestinian trade unions in late 2023 to “end all forms of complicity with Israel’s crimes,” including “halting the arms trade with Israel” and “all funding and military research,” UCSC grad workers started looking toward their own workplace to take action. They weren’t the only ones. At Columbia University, some grad workers were also thinking along the same lines. “We were looking at our science and saying, ‘This is pretty messed up,’” said Kelsey Harrison, a third-year Chemistry PhD student. “Our government is sending weapons that are being used by Israel, and our science is contributing to advancing those weapons.” Building a National Network Toward the end of 2023, these grad workers were increasingly connecting with each other across campuses to discuss what they could do, as university workers, about Israel’s war on Palestine. This connecting was made easier because many of these grad workers were already plugged into a preexisting network of cross-campus union solidarity. The past few years have seen a historic wave of bottom-up grad worker organizing. Thousands of grad workers have unionized and gone on strike. This new campus labor militancy has been driven by militant, democratic unionism, often affiliated with left-led unions like the United Auto Workers (UAW) and United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America (UE). This organizing infrastructure, connecting grad workers from the University of California to Columbia, Michigan to MIT, laid the basis for easier communication, strategizing, and skill-sharing around Palestinian solidarity and anti-militarism work on campus. “None of this is by coincidence,” said Harrison. Dozens of grad workers were already communicating through Zoom calls and group chats. There was growing interest in digging into university ties to militarism and the war on Gaza. With consciousness heightened by years of organizing, there was a sense that grad workers, given their critical role at universities and science labs, could have a big impact as workers in the Palestine solidarity movement, especially by withholding their labor. “When we saw this call to end complicity and stop arming Israel, we realized that it was graduate workers who were positioned to intervene at the very beginning of the supply chain,” said Kain. “It was graduate workers who were positioned to cut the flow of labor and expertise and work going into the military industrial complex that will flow on to harm Palestinians.” “Palestine is absolutely a workplace issue,” she said. With interest growing, some suggested that grad workers meet more concertedly to dig into their university’s connections to the catastrophe in Gaza and to U.S. militarism. As workers embedded in the military supply chain, they could use the research into these ties to help identify points of leverage to disrupt the war machine. A new network, Researchers Against War (RAW), was born out of this moment. Going into 2024, RAW held zoom meetings that brought together grad workers across the U.S. Mike Locker, a co-author of the original 1968 pamphlet “Who Rules Columbia?,” offered guidance on the ties between universities and militarism and how power research could support their organizing. Out of all this, grad workers were feeling galvanized to look deeper into their employers — their universities and labs — to support Palestine and challenge the larger military-industrial complex. “Researching Like Mad” Emboldened and connected, grad workers were starting to map out their institutions’ ties to the war machine, supporting each other by sharing research tips and organizing advice. At UCSC, around ten grad workers began “researching like mad for a couple of months,” said Kain, mapping the flows of money from the Department of Defense to UCSC and University of California system. They dug into public records of federal grants, mined sites like USASpending.gov, followed grant numbers tied to specific labs, and looked at the school’s Office of Sponsored Projects. Kain said that in 2023 the University of California system received $333 million of Department of Defense basic research funding that flowed into a range of labs across campuses. At UCSC specifically, they found 18 labs with active Department of Defense contracts and 10 labs with recently expired DoD contracts. They identified areas of potential “research misuse,” as Kain put it, meaning “clearly weaponizable stuff.” UCSC grad workers used these findings to organize within their departments. “It was really this funding research that unlocked the possibility of talking to our coworkers,” said Kain. In January 2024, nearly three dozen UCSC astronomers penned a collective letter that stated their commitments to “demilitarizing” their research, with specific demands like “withholding academic labor benefiting militarism” and “refusing research collaboration with federal military institutions as well as private arms and defense companies.” In exchange for millions of Pentagon funding, said the letter, “the products of our research lubricate the churning gears of the war machine.” The letter made direct connections between labor performed at UCSC and the genocide in Palestine and called “on all academic workers everywhere – graduate students, postdocs, lecturers, faculty – to divest their labor from apartheid, genocide, and militarism.” The UCSC astrophysics letter was an inspiring model to a core of Columbia grad workers who had also started to explore their school’s ties to weapons’ companies. They discovered that a “huge amount” of Defense Department funding went into basic research at research institutions. In 2021, Columbia received over $49 million in research and development funding from the Defense Department, the 28th most in the nation. A snapshot from Columbia grad workers’ research into Pentagon lab funding at Columbia. With this research, they started putting together a chart that tied Pentagon funding to specific research projects at Columbia. Like UCSC, Columbia grad workers used their research to support organizing within their departments, holding one-on-one conversations with fellow grad workers. The research was a “great way to bring people in,” said Harrison. “A lot of people cared about Palestine but didn’t know what to do about it. This is a very concrete way that they can start to look into their own position and role and how they’re contributing to the military.” Teach-Ins and Research Committees Meanwhile, RAW was working to expand the national effort among grad workers to challenge, as higher ed laborers, the flow of their labor into military production and campus ties to militarism. On February 12, RAW hosted a national teach-in and organizing discussion over Zoom, titled “Demilitarizing Research from Vietnam to Palestine,” where dozens of attendees heard from grad workers and post-docs who had started to map and organize around their schools’ Pentagon ties. Teach-in attendees also heard from veterans of the 1960s and 1970s like Mike Locker, who recalled how the Vietnam antiwar movement used power research to protest against campus ties to the war machine. Along the way, grad workers at individual campuses continued to push the movement locally. Columbia RAW members spoke at the Columbia encampment on April 19, where they also passed out a RAW brochure. From the Researchers Against War (RAW) brochure A few days later, on April 22, Columbia RAW and Science for the People, a group dedicated to demilitarizing science research, held a joint campus teach-in at Columbia on the movement for antiwar STEM research. Columbia RAW gave a presentation, “Towards Anti-War STEM Research,” that laid out in painstaking detail the ties between the Defense Department and university research labs. A slide from Columbia RAW’s teach-in presentation, “Towards Anti-War STEM Research.” Other campuses were also plugging into the national research network. At the University of Michigan, grad workers with the Graduate Employees’ Organization (GEO) were among the several campus efforts to hold a “watch party” for RAW’s February 12 teach-in. GEO had started a Palestine solidarity working group as part of the union’s Solidarity and Political Action Committee. The working group had different arms, including a research team. Grad researchers started to “map labs around campus,” said Nathan Kim, a PhD student at the University of Michigan School of Information, and “basically try to determine what different sources of funding they were getting.” With those research findings, they’d use an “organizing approach,” Kim said — for example, talking to students about Project Nimbus when they discovered funding from Google. They hoped to “politicize what it means to do research,” said Kim, and organize grad workers to refuse Pentagon funding. This “lab tracker research” was one wing of their larger research efforts; endowment research and research into the University of Michigan’s affiliations with pro-Israel institutions such as the Michigan-Israel Partnership were others. Part of the zine on the UMichigan endowment that researchers and comms organizers put together. After the TAHRIR Coalition formed at the University of Michigan in November 2023, GEO grad workers continued to do research as different efforts across the campus gravitated together, and GEO and its research team soon became part of the broader campus-wide TAHRIR project. Power Research and the Columbia Encampment As in 1968, students at Columbia University in 2024 made a breakthrough for the wider campus movement when their April 2024 encampment — and the repression against it — galvanized the nation. Power research played a role in informing the encampment’s demands and messaging. In October 2023, Columbia students reactivated Columbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD), which formed in 2016 but had since become inactive, and formed different CUAD subcommittees, including a research committee. In late 2023 the coalition submitted a lengthy divestment proposal to Columbia’s Advisory Committee on Socially Responsible Investing (it was rejected). With the April 2024 encampmentent taking off, the research committee put together a tabling pamphlet that contained a power map of university ties to Israeli occupation, apartheid and genocide. It showed how university trustees were tied to war profiteering. From the tabling pamphlet compiled by the CUAD research committee at Columbia Trustee Jeh Johnson, for example, is a board director of Lockheed Martin, a major weapons supplier to Israel. It also showed how the Columbia University Investment Company, which oversees CU’s endowment, invests in companies like Google and Microsoft, and in the funds of asset management giant BlackRock, who all bolster Israel’s ongoing oppression of Palestinans. From the tabling pamphlet compiled by the CUAD research committee at Columbia A Columbia undergraduate and CUAD member who was involved in making the power map, and who asked that their name be withheld, said the map’s creation was very much a “communal process.” It started with a scribbled rough draft on paper. The draft was based on researchers’ findings. Out of this, someone used a computer program to create the finished map that was used in the pamphlet. The power map and the brochure were created for specific organizing purposes. Organizers wanted to make accessible for students the material connections between Columbia and Palestine. “It’s not necessarily clear to an ordinary college student how they have a direct and personal connection to the genocide,” said the Columbia undergraduate. “The brochure was the best way to lay out our understanding of that connection in a direct way,” conveying “how we felt and what we learned from our research inside CUAD,” they said. The pamphlet made transparent and concrete what the encampment was demanding. “It showed that students were fighting for divestment from these primary companies, and why,” said the Columbia undergraduate. The research into the Columbia University power structure also informed protest strategy. This included choosing specific trustees to protest. “Our research allows us to pick the best possible target and have the most direct justification for our action,” they said. Organizing and Research Across Other Campuses Research and power mapping played important roles within a range of other university protests as well. University of California organizers mapped out the UC Board of Regents and named certain investments tied to Israel. Organizers at the University of Massachusetts laid out their ties to weapons producer Raytheon. At Emory University, organizers focused on the role of Motorola’s surveillance technology from Atlanta to Palestine. Researchers at the University of Michigan compiled a thorough report on their endowment, handed out divestment flyers, and used power research to agitate on social media around the Board of Regents and endowment. Brown University did not have an umbrella coalition like CUAD at Columbia or TAHRIR at Michigan, but different groups came together to engage in direct actions, a hunger strike, and an encampment. Palestine solidarity work at Brown has drawn on inspiring precedents of campus divestment campaigns against South African apartheid in the 1980s. The current upsurge has also built on organizing and research from the past few years. In 2020, a student divestment vote created the Advisory Committee on Corporate Responsibility in Investment Policies (ACCRIP), which issued a report, compiled by a group of faculty, grad students, and undergrads, arguing that Brown’s own ESG standards Brown should divest from companies that “facilitate the Israeli occupation of Palestinian Territory.” Because of all this, said Brown senior Kian Braulik, there was already “a broad base of support for divestment” that “was really democratic” when students started organizing to oppose Israel’s siege of Gaza. Braulik said a group of researchers from different campus groups collaboratively revised that report, extending it from the original 16 pages to over 50 pages, adding new graphic designing to make it look catchier. During the encampment, they handed out copies of the report to show people why they were protesting and what their demands were around divestment. Cover of the longer updated 2024 edition of recommending Brown divest from Israeli occupation Campus organizers also made flyers of ten companies they want Brown to divest from, including Safariland, Boeing, General Dynamics, RTX (formerly Raytheon) and others, with explanations why. All this research and mapping informed the demands at Brown, said Braulik, including their decision to protest Maria Zuber, a Brown trustee who also sits on the board of Textron, a military contractor headquartered in Providence that provides Israel with weapons. Textron, headquartered in Providence, was one company that the Brown University movement highlighted. Organizers at Yale University also made use of power research. Taran Samarth, a second-year PhD student in political science, notes that power research has “deep roots” in New Haven and Yale. Grad workers affiliated with Local 33 Unite Here have used power research to support their organizing, while Fossil Free Yale imparted critical help for campus Palestine organizers. Samarth said the organizers who had done fossil finance research were “really helpful” in supporting Yale’s Palestinian solidarity movement and that “those same skills” were deployed to “thinking about Palestine and about the genocide.” Samarth said there hadn’t previously been much focus among Palestinian solidarity activists on Yale’s investments. “If people said divestment, it was sort of a gesture,” they said. “We didn’t really know what the connections were because no one had really done the work to investigate them.” Yale organizers stepped up that research in October 2023, as campus actions started taking off. In November, an anonymous zine was distributed that named specific connections between Yale and Israel’s war on Palestine through Yale’s investments, while the Yale Endowment Justice Coalition campaigned around Yale’s investments in weapons’ companies through ETF funds. Page from anonymous zine on Yale’s endowment’s ties, “Yale is Complicit.” “Power research was a really key part of demand-making and orienting the campus movement early on,” said Samarth. The following months saw direct action protests, teach-ins, and the encampment, all which focused on divestment demands that research helped to clarify. Samarth also says that that power research helped students develop a deeper understanding of the corporate university. “There’s this whole broader problem of the university and its relationships with New Haven and the world,” they said.” From the “Yale Corp, Divest from War” pamphlet, distributed at the Beinecke Plaza occupation and encampment at Yale in the Spring of 2024. And while these campus movements played out locally, they were also stitched together through national networks and coalitions. For example, Kim at University of Michigan, Braulik and Brown, and Samarth at Yale were among the researchers who connected to form the Endowment Justice Research Network (EJRN). “We were just trying to get people working on similar things together to talk to each other and develop methods together,” said Kim. Kim went to conferences like Labor Notes and the People’s Conference for Palestine in Detroit and passed out half sheets with QR codes to grow the network or recruited by word of mouth. This past summer, EJRN co-hosted a webinar with LittleSis on endowment research. “One goal of the EJRN is to identify some shared connections across universities,” said Kim. “Finding points where we can mobilize a shared campaign would be awesome, and that’s one goal for the future that we have.” 1968’s “Who Rules Columbia?” Inspires a New Generation When grad workers and campus organizers started researching and power mapping their universities’ ties to militarism, they didn’t do this in a historical vacuum. This new organizing wave drew inspiration from campus divestment movements against South African apartheid from the 1980s, and, especially, from power research efforts five decades earlier in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1968, Columbia students waged a historic protest on campus against the university’s connections to racism and the war in Vietnam. Out of this, a small group of researchers produced a powerful pamphlet, “Who Rules Columbia?,” that mapped out and analyzed the university’s power structure and its deep ties to the war machine and corporate interests. “Who Rules Columbia?” showed that universities were deeply interlocked with society’s larger corporate power structure and ruling elite. The same forces and interests dominating national politics and economic decision-making — real estate, Wall Street, the military industrial complex — also occupied the governing heights of university power. For grad workers at Columbia organizing around Palestine, “Who Rules Colombia?” was an inspiration. “Reading it showed me what is possible,” said Harrison. Nor were they just abstractly inspired by “Who Rules Columbia?” They were mentored by and worked closely with Mike Locker, a seasoned power researcher who was one of the original authors of the original pamphlet in 1968. Locker joined Researchers Against War meetings and Columbia grads soon connected with him directly. They started having regular breakfasts with him where they would absorb lessons from Locker’s years of experience doing power research. We would “just sit down and talk and ask each other questions and check in,” said one Columbia grad worker in chemistry, who asked that their name be withheld. “He’s able to apply his strategies from the 1960s to current times. It’s just been incredible, not only for information and resources, but also for inspiration.” “Who Rules Columbia?” tweeted out by one grad worker during the April 2024 encampment wave Kim said the research group at University of Michigan read Who Rules Columbia? and that the pamphlet “changed our campaign” by focusing attention on the university as a larger power structure, such as “the people controlling the endowment” and “the backgrounds of the regents.” “‘Who Rules Colombia?’ made us realize that what’s most important and useful to us is not just understanding what the endowment is invested in,” said Kim, “but the networks of power around the university that control things at large.” Because of this, University of Michigan organizers started new research projects, including a dossier on the Board of Regents. Kim also took inspiration from Locker — a University of Michigan alum — when the power research veteran joined the debut Researchers Against War teach-in that included grad workers from across universities. “He talked about his own experiences, both at Columbia and the University of Michigan,” said Kim. “That was super helpful for us.” It wasn’t just the mentoring and support from Locker that inspired the Columbia grad workers who met with him. It was also his personal example as someone who has dedicated his life to the movement. “To see people who had been committed in 1968, in their youth, and who are still committed,” was deeply inspiring for the Columbia grad worker who asked that their name be withheld. “It really grounds you in the fact that this is a lifelong commitment and that it’s possible to lead a life that is guided by your values.” * * * The current campus movements for Palestine illustrate the usefulness of power research for supporting organizing efforts. The deeper ties between universities and militarism are not necessarily apparent, but research and mapping can help uncover and illustrate these connections. Doing so helps educate movements, offering a clearer sense of what they’re up against, and making more transparent how universities are both power structures within themselves as well as crucial components of the wider corporate and militarist power structure. Understanding these interlocks and connections opens up new strategic and tactical possibilities for organizers. Moreover, the very process of doing the research can be an organizing tool: a collective endeavor that builds cohesion, consciousness and solidarity. Critically, it’s important to remember that power research is not an end in itself, but rather a tool that serves organizing efforts and, often, can strengthen them — whether that be for grad workers making clearer sense of their relationship to the military supply chain and how to disrupt it, or campus groups seeking to better understand and communicate their institution’s ties to the war machine and identify focuses for protest actions. University power — elite-managed, corporate-tied, military-aligned, ultimately repressive — has been unmasked for a new generation of students. RAW is still meeting regularly and drawing from grad workers in the sciences, engineering and humanities. Campus groups are retooling their efforts to challenge university ties to militarism. As a new semester takes off; as Israel’s monstrous war against Palestinians continues, fully backed by the U.S. and its military industry; and as the corporate university shows no signs of abating, we may be seeing just the beginning of a new wave of power research and mapping of campus power structures — and beyond.

Title: Why The Ether ETF Has Underperformed Versus Bitcoin
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/09/29/why-the-ether-etf-has-underperformed-versus-bitcoin/
Time Published: 2024-09-29T17:19:23Z
Full Content:
Ether continues to grow but price levels remain subdued When the SEC announced it had approved multiple spot ether ETF products in July 2024 market sentiment was almost universally supportive and encouraged by this action. Following years of stymying efforts by industry advocates and operators to create and trade spot ETFs, the two largest cryptocurrencies – bitcoin and ether – had received ETF approval within the same year. In stark contrast to the dramatic increase in price that bitcoin experienced, the majority of which has remined intact even as headline volatility has continued to increase, the price response to the ether ETF was muted. Even more interestingly the trading volumes and institutional appetite for these ETF products has also remained more lower than the spot bitcoin ETF and/or market forecasts. Highlighting this sluggish beginning are the outflows that have been occurring from the ether ETF products, capped by a nearly $80 million outflow on a single Monday, which was the highest since a $98 million outflow figure in July 2024. While bitcoin has increased over 50% in 2024 (since the launch of spot ETF products), ether has only climbed approximately 15% and has yet to surpass the previous all-time-highs last achieved in 2021. From whichever metric is analyzed the launch of spot ether ETFs has fallen flat when compared to spot bitcoin ETFs. Let’s take a look at a few of the reasons why, despite serving as the blockchain of choice for many Layer 2 applications, the ether ETF has gotten off to a slow start. Even though the cryptoasset space has expanded dramatically in just the last several years, the reality remains that in most media and institutional conversations, bitcoin is still the unquestioned leader. This can be observed either through anecdotally observing business media coverage and corporate announcements, and by watching the actions of TradFi institutions and nation-states alike. Bitcoin ETFs have attracted billions in investment while sending the price of bitcoin up substantially, while corporate purchasers such as Microstrategy continue to focus on exclusively purchasing bitcoin. Larry Fink and Blackrock have issued public facing documents touting the appeal and upside of bitcoin, and nations such as El Salvador and more recently Bhutan have amassed stockpiles of bitcoin. Bitcoin continues to dominate the crypto landscape, as well as the dollars that are being allocated by larger institutional investors. As multi-faceted as the crypto landscape continues to be, the narrative and messaging around bitcoin has remained uniquely consistent since inception. From being labeled as digital gold, or a store or value, or the money of the future the narratives around bitcoin have remained steadfast. Even if the specifics of these narratives, or how well they manifest in the market, investors and regulators alike have become familiar with them to base decision making around these frameworks. This consistency has manifested itself even bitcoin is famously decentralized, has no identified creator, nor does the cryptocurrency have any sort of governing body. Ether on the other hand, has seemingly struggled to find a message and/or narrative that is consistent enough, simple enough, or intuitive enough to be seized by mainstream investors. Even though the Ethereum blockchain and the ether token serves as the base layer for many of the enterprise applications that are driving the investment dollars into crypto, the presentation of Ethereum as the internet of the future or other amorphous value propositions have proven difficult for institutional investors to get behind. Last but certainly not least is the reality that, and directly connected to the primary value proposition of Ethereum and ether at large is the fact that ether is perhaps the token most susceptible to the crypto price paradox. Ether serves as the currency of choice for most of the Layer 2 applications that are driving enterprise adoption; stablecoins, DeFi, DAOs, and even NFTs all (for the most part) run and rely on ether. Even with improvements made via various upgrades – which have substantially increased capacity and reduced cost – the fact remains that pricing services in ether will have exercise downward pressure on a price-per-token basis. Put simply any token, be it ether or otherwise, that simultaneously serves as a potential medium of exchange and investment asset (via spot ETFs), is going to need to obtain a medium satisfactory to both interested parties. Given the muted price action of ether following the approval and launch of spot ether ETFs, and the preference of institutions and governments to select bitcoin above other cryptoassets, and it appears that this paradox will continue to exercise influence for the foreseeable future. Crypto ETFs have been a positive development for the sector, but not all such instruments deliver equally positive returns. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Clontarf and Young Munster are the only unbeaten sides in Division 1A after just two rounds of the Energia All-Ireland League which indicates this may well be a particularly competitive campaign in the top flight. Young Munster beat Terenure for the fourth year running at Tom Clifford Park with a thrilling 34-30 victory in which the lead exchanged five times. When Harrison Brewer finished off the try of the match early in the second half and Aran Egan converted they led 22-14, but Munsters responded with a fine try by winger Hubert Gilvarry, which dead-eyed Argentinian outhalf Julian Leszczynski converted from the touchline. After Leszczynski and Egan exchanged penalties, the former then converted a try by Manuel Covella before Egan failed to convert his own try. Leszczynski kicked a penalty before Munsters withheld another siege on their line. Clontarf lead on 10 points courtesy of a second bonus-point win by 29-21 at home to Garryowen courtesy of tries by Dylan Donnellan, inevitably, Tadhg Bird, Louis O’Reilly and Seni Reilly Ashiru. It was the first time that Keith Wood’s three sons – Gordon, Tom and Alex – played together for Garryowen, but although Gordon was on the scoresheet again the Limerick club were unfortunate to emerge with no tangible reward. Defending champions Cork Constitution returned to winning ways with a thumping 51-21 win over Ballynahinch, their Munster fullback Scott Buckley scoring two of their tries. Newly promoted St Mary’s moved up to third in the table with a 32-22 bonus-point away to City of Armagh, while Lansdowne beat UCD 25-10. Similarly in 1B, Nenagh Ormond, with winger Conor McMahon contributing 23 points, and Old Belvedere recorded statement bonus-point wins away to Blackrock and Trinity to emerge as the only two sides in the second tier with two wins from two. There were four high-scoring home wins in 2A, Barnhall leading the way with 11 tries against Buccaneers, while Navan’s first home game in their centenary season was a 22-22 draw with Old Crescent. Division 1A: City of Armagh 22 St Mary’s College 32; Clontarf 29 Garryowen 21; Cork Constitution 51 Ballynahinch 21; Lansdowne 25 UCD 10; Young Munster 34 Terenure College 30.

Title: BlackRock Dismisses Bitcoin’s Risk Label, Calls It A Smart Investor Play
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-dismisses-bitcoins-risk-label-calls-it-a-smart-investor-play/
Time Published: 2024-09-29T13:00:49Z

BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is currently generating significant interest within the investment community with its most recent report, “Bitcoin: A Unique Diversifier.” This document emphasizes the potential of Bitcoin as a unique asset class that can improve portfolio diversification. BlackRock manages assets valued over $10 trillion, therefore their advice is quite important. The company contends that the distinctive features of Bitcoin, such as its distributed nature and fixed number, set it apart from other conventional financial assets. BlackRock’s effectively launched Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) currently boasts holdings of around $21 billion. Originally introduced earlier this year, the ETF iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has drawn a lot of investor interest. Actually, the fund has garnered more than $14 billion in assets, which demonstrate growing conviction in Bitcoin as a lucrative choice of investment. BlackRock’s research shows that Bitcoin behaves quite differently than traditional risk assets. The company notes that Bitcoin has shown significant volatility, but it insists that its long-term performance is mostly unaffected by other financial markets. For example, bitcoin is up 22% since August 5 when the Yen carry trade was unwound, while gold and the S&P 500 have only risen modestly around 11%. This could suggest that bitcoin has the capability of working in isolation of regular market changes, which therefore makes it a rather compelling choice for investors who would wish to achieve certainties in their investing. The report also underscores the fact that a significant number of Bitcoin holders are experiencing profits. According to data, the majority of investors who have maintained their Bitcoin investments for three years or longer are currently profitable. This trend indicates that there is a growing consensus among investors that Bitcoin can function as a secure refuge during periods of economic instability. More individuals are turning to Bitcoin as a potential store of value as geopolitical tensions increase and trust in traditional financial institutions diminishes. What’s remarkable is how reflective of an institutional investor shift toward cryptocurrencies in general BlackRock’s posture has been. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink once was skeptical of digital assets, but has since realized that his skepticism toward Bitcoin was actually “misguided.” This is characteristic of the growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies by mainstream financial organizations. As the institutions are increasing their adoption of Bitcoin, its credibility and acceptance rate will increase with the entry of institutions like BlackRock, which will push it into the mainstream. Another interesting question is whether Bitcoin is a risk-on or risk-off asset. Its near-term trading patterns appear to lean toward risk-on behavior, but long-term data paints another story.

Title: Brace for impact: Something big is coming

Skip to comments. Posted on 09/29/2024 4:02:28 AM PDT by george76 For the last couple of months, I’ve been noting various articles in which very rich people are taking some remarkable steps: Buffett’s vice chairman dumps over half of his Berkshire shares.. Warren Buffett offloads Bank of America shares worth $982 million in latest sale.. Buffett’s Berkshire offloads Bank of America shares again; total sales near $7 billion.. Berkshire quietly dumps half its Apple shares amid unprecedented selling spree.. Blackrock reveals it’s quietly preparing for a $35 trillion Federal Reserve crisis with Bitcoin.. Jeff Bezos sells another $863.5 million of Amazon stock.. Now, clearly wealthy people are always shifting around their financial portfolios. Still, these activities were unusual enough to warrant media attention. This begs the question, what do they know that we don’t know? Wealthy people (usually) aren’t fools. They watch the economic climate. It’s (usually) how they became wealthy. And the economic climate they’re watching apparently is worrying them. Now consider these headlines: JPMorgan CEO hints at looming crisis worse than recession.. Interest on U.S. debt surpasses $1 trillion for first time ever, exploding August budget deficit to record high.. An economy so strong it requires crisis-level fed action And, of course: Household debt hits record $17.8 trillion.. Conclusion from all these headlines: Something big is coming, and it’s the little people who will get hurt the most. ... Everyone is predicting what kinds of bad stuff will happen if Kamala wins. The tax plans and economic policies she’s outlined (including raising the corporate tax rate from 21 to 28% and taxing unrealized capital gains) are making wealthy people nervous. One hedge fund billionaire said the proposed tax on unrealized capital gains on individuals making $100 million or more was particularly troubling and “would cause mass selling of almost everything – stocks, bonds, homes, art – I think it would result in a crash in the markets and an immediate, pretty quick recession.” But a Kamala presidency is predicted to impact the lower to middle-class the most. Increased regulations, taxes and inflation always hit the lowest sectors the hardest. But not as many people are predicting what kinds of bad stuff will happen if Trump is reelected. The Deep State pushback against his leadership is likely to be vicious and could include everything from deliberately crashing the economy to triggering terrorist sleeper cells. As Trump himself said, “Our country right now is in the most dangerous position it’s ever been in from an economic standpoint, from a safety standpoint.. You could end up in a depression of the 1929 variety. We’re very close to that, and we’re very close to a world war.” One person noted, “I believe they will INTENTIONALLY crash the economy right as [Trump] takes office. They will intentionally make it worse than 1929, so that he is so burdened and so distracted and in such a hole that even all of his brilliance will take four years just to dig us out and get us back to ‘normal,’ and then they will succeed because he will not be able to get anything else done during that time. All efforts will go towards rebuilding our economy from the rubble.” ... Even a former FBI agent is suggesting stocking up on three to four months’ worth of food, arming yourself, and clubbing up with neighbors. Again, what does he know that we don’t know? Something is coming, folks. Something much bigger than we as individuals can fight against. Whether that something is medical, economic, societal, political, or some combination therefore – the point is, something is coming. Whatever this “something” will be, it’s almost a sure bet it will nullify our constitutional rights of speech, religion, self-defense and other critical issues. Interpret that as you will, but don’t ignore the ramifications. This “something” may also impact your financial security (if it hasn’t already) and even your food supply. Whatever steps you choose to take, take them now. Something big is coming, and we need to brace for impact. Food for thought as the election looms dead ahead.

As they raised rates a bit that was starting to change where at least the 6 month bills were getting the highest rates. These rates were still higher than the 20/30 yr bonds so still inversion territory. Now, with the recent rate decrease, it’s back to 4 week t bills at the highest rate. So maybe the rate cut was actually premature and executed for political purposes and the rates will have to increase again (after the election of course). Since the markets went up significantly after the rate cut, and knowing they will, at least temporarily, drop after resumed increases, it makes sense to sell at the high point now and buy back when it tanks. 11 posted on 09/29/2024 4:15:56 AM PDT by fruser1 [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SaveFerris Interest payments on just the federal government debt now exceed the entire Defense Department budget..

So maybe the rate cut was actually premature and executed for political purposes and the rates will have to increase again (after the election of course).

Buffett’s Berkshire offloads Bank of America shares again; total sales near $7 billion.. Berkshire quietly dumps half its Apple shares amid unprecedented selling spree.. Blackrock reveals it’s quietly preparing for a $35 trillion Federal Reserve crisis with Bitcoin.. Jeff Bezos sells another $863.5 million of Amazon stock.. Now, clearly wealthy people are always shifting around their financial portfolios. Still, these activities were unusual enough to warrant media attention. This begs the question, what do they know that we don’t know? Wealthy people (usually) aren’t fools. They watch the economic climate. It’s (usually) how they became wealthy. And the economic climate they’re watching apparently is worrying them. Now consider these headlines: JPMorgan CEO hints at looming crisis worse than recession.. Interest on U.S. debt surpasses $1 trillion for first time ever, exploding August budget deficit to record high.. An economy so strong it requires crisis-level fed action And, of course: Household debt hits record $17.8 trillion.. Conclusion from all these headlines: Something big is coming, and it’s the little people who will get hurt the most. ... Everyone is predicting what kinds of bad stuff will happen if Kamala wins. The tax plans and economic policies she’s outlined (including raising the corporate tax rate from 21 to 28% and taxing unrealized capital gains) are making wealthy people nervous. One hedge fund billionaire said the proposed tax on unrealized capital gains on individuals making $100 million or more was particularly troubling and “would cause mass selling of almost everything – stocks, bonds, homes, art – I think it would result in a crash in the markets and an immediate, pretty quick recession.” But a Kamala presidency is predicted to impact the lower to middle-class the most. Increased regulations, taxes and inflation always hit the lowest sectors the hardest. But not as many people are predicting what kinds of bad stuff will happen if Trump is reelected. The Deep State pushback against his leadership is likely to be vicious and could include everything from deliberately crashing the economy to triggering terrorist sleeper cells. As Trump himself said, “Our country right now is in the most dangerous position it’s ever been in from an economic standpoint, from a safety standpoint.. You could end up in a depression of the 1929 variety. We’re very close to that, and we’re very close to a world war.” One person noted, “I believe they will INTENTIONALLY crash the economy right as [Trump] takes office. They will intentionally make it worse than 1929, so that he is so burdened and so distracted and in such a hole that even all of his brilliance will take four years just to dig us out and get us back to ‘normal,’ and then they will succeed because he will not be able to get anything else done during that time. All efforts will go towards rebuilding our economy from the rubble.” ... Even a former FBI agent is suggesting stocking up on three to four months’ worth of food, arming yourself, and clubbing up with neighbors. Again, what does he know that we don’t know? Something is coming, folks. Something much bigger than we as individuals can fight against. Whether that something is medical, economic, societal, political, or some combination therefore – the point is, something is coming. Whatever this “something” will be, it’s almost a sure bet it will nullify our constitutional rights of speech, religion, self-defense and other critical issues. Interpret that as you will, but don’t ignore the ramifications. This “something” may also impact your financial security (if it hasn’t already) and even your food supply. Whatever steps you choose to take, take them now. Something big is coming, and we need to brace for impact. Food for thought as the election looms dead ahead.

So maybe the rate cut was actually premature and executed for political purposes and the rates will have to increase again (after the election of course). Since the markets went up significantly after the rate cut, and knowing they will, at least temporarily, drop after resumed increases, it makes sense to sell at the high point now and buy back when it tanks. 11 posted on 09/29/2024 4:15:56 AM PDT by fruser1 [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SaveFerris Interest payments on just the federal government debt now exceed the entire Defense Department budget..

Blackrock reveals it’s quietly preparing for a $35 trillion Federal Reserve crisis with Bitcoin.. Jeff Bezos sells another $863.5 million of Amazon stock.. Now, clearly wealthy people are always shifting around their financial portfolios. Still, these activities were unusual enough to warrant media attention. This begs the question, what do they know that we don’t know? Wealthy people (usually) aren’t fools. They watch the economic climate. It’s (usually) how they became wealthy. And the economic climate they’re watching apparently is worrying them. Now consider these headlines: JPMorgan CEO hints at looming crisis worse than recession.. Interest on U.S. debt surpasses $1 trillion for first time ever, exploding August budget deficit to record high.. An economy so strong it requires crisis-level fed action And, of course: Household debt hits record $17.8 trillion.. Conclusion from all these headlines: Something big is coming, and it’s the little people who will get hurt the most. ... Everyone is predicting what kinds of bad stuff will happen if Kamala wins. The tax plans and economic policies she’s outlined (including raising the corporate tax rate from 21 to 28% and taxing unrealized capital gains) are making wealthy people nervous. One hedge fund billionaire said the proposed tax on unrealized capital gains on individuals making $100 million or more was particularly troubling and “would cause mass selling of almost everything – stocks, bonds, homes, art – I think it would result in a crash in the markets and an immediate, pretty quick recession.” But a Kamala presidency is predicted to impact the lower to middle-class the most. Increased regulations, taxes and inflation always hit the lowest sectors the hardest. But not as many people are predicting what kinds of bad stuff will happen if Trump is reelected. The Deep State pushback against his leadership is likely to be vicious and could include everything from deliberately crashing the economy to triggering terrorist sleeper cells. As Trump himself said, “Our country right now is in the most dangerous position it’s ever been in from an economic standpoint, from a safety standpoint.. You could end up in a depression of the 1929 variety. We’re very close to that, and we’re very close to a world war.” One person noted, “I believe they will INTENTIONALLY crash the economy right as [Trump] takes office. They will intentionally make it worse than 1929, so that he is so burdened and so distracted and in such a hole that even all of his brilliance will take four years just to dig us out and get us back to ‘normal,’ and then they will succeed because he will not be able to get anything else done during that time. All efforts will go towards rebuilding our economy from the rubble.” ... Even a former FBI agent is suggesting stocking up on three to four months’ worth of food, arming yourself, and clubbing up with neighbors. Again, what does he know that we don’t know? Something is coming, folks. Something much bigger than we as individuals can fight against. Whether that something is medical, economic, societal, political, or some combination therefore – the point is, something is coming. Whatever this “something” will be, it’s almost a sure bet it will nullify our constitutional rights of speech, religion, self-defense and other critical issues. Interpret that as you will, but don’t ignore the ramifications. This “something” may also impact your financial security (if it hasn’t already) and even your food supply. Whatever steps you choose to take, take them now. Something big is coming, and we need to brace for impact. Food for thought as the election looms dead ahead.

Interest on U.S. debt surpasses $1 trillion for first time ever, exploding August budget deficit to record high.. An economy so strong it requires crisis-level fed action And, of course: Household debt hits record $17.8 trillion.. Conclusion from all these headlines: Something big is coming, and it’s the little people who will get hurt the most. ... Everyone is predicting what kinds of bad stuff will happen if Kamala wins. The tax plans and economic policies she’s outlined (including raising the corporate tax rate from 21 to 28% and taxing unrealized capital gains) are making wealthy people nervous. One hedge fund billionaire said the proposed tax on unrealized capital gains on individuals making $100 million or more was particularly troubling and “would cause mass selling of almost everything – stocks, bonds, homes, art – I think it would result in a crash in the markets and an immediate, pretty quick recession.” But a Kamala presidency is predicted to impact the lower to middle-class the most. Increased regulations, taxes and inflation always hit the lowest sectors the hardest. But not as many people are predicting what kinds of bad stuff will happen if Trump is reelected. The Deep State pushback against his leadership is likely to be vicious and could include everything from deliberately crashing the economy to triggering terrorist sleeper cells. As Trump himself said, “Our country right now is in the most dangerous position it’s ever been in from an economic standpoint, from a safety standpoint.. You could end up in a depression of the 1929 variety. We’re very close to that, and we’re very close to a world war.” One person noted, “I believe they will INTENTIONALLY crash the economy right as [Trump] takes office. They will intentionally make it worse than 1929, so that he is so burdened and so distracted and in such a hole that even all of his brilliance will take four years just to dig us out and get us back to ‘normal,’ and then they will succeed because he will not be able to get anything else done during that time. All efforts will go towards rebuilding our economy from the rubble.” ... Even a former FBI agent is suggesting stocking up on three to four months’ worth of food, arming yourself, and clubbing up with neighbors. Again, what does he know that we don’t know? Something is coming, folks. Something much bigger than we as individuals can fight against. Whether that something is medical, economic, societal, political, or some combination therefore – the point is, something is coming. Whatever this “something” will be, it’s almost a sure bet it will nullify our constitutional rights of speech, religion, self-defense and other critical issues. Interpret that as you will, but don’t ignore the ramifications. This “something” may also impact your financial security (if it hasn’t already) and even your food supply. Whatever steps you choose to take, take them now. Something big is coming, and we need to brace for impact. Food for thought as the election looms dead ahead.

As they raised rates a bit that was starting to change where at least the 6 month bills were getting the highest rates. These rates were still higher than the 20/30 yr bonds so still inversion territory. Now, with the recent rate decrease, it’s back to 4 week t bills at the highest rate. So maybe the rate cut was actually premature and executed for political purposes and the rates will have to increase again (after the election of course). Since the markets went up significantly after the rate cut, and knowing they will, at least temporarily, drop after resumed increases, it makes sense to sell at the high point now and buy back when it tanks. 11 posted on 09/29/2024 4:15:56 AM PDT by fruser1 [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SaveFerris Interest payments on just the federal government debt now exceed the entire Defense Department budget..

Interest on U.S. debt surpasses $1 trillion for first time ever, exploding August budget deficit to record high.. An economy so strong it requires crisis-level fed action And, of course: Household debt hits record $17.8 trillion.. Conclusion from all these headlines: Something big is coming, and it’s the little people who will get hurt the most. ... Everyone is predicting what kinds of bad stuff will happen if Kamala wins. The tax plans and economic policies she’s outlined (including raising the corporate tax rate from 21 to 28% and taxing unrealized capital gains) are making wealthy people nervous. One hedge fund billionaire said the proposed tax on unrealized capital gains on individuals making $100 million or more was particularly troubling and “would cause mass selling of almost everything – stocks, bonds, homes, art – I think it would result in a crash in the markets and an immediate, pretty quick recession.” But a Kamala presidency is predicted to impact the lower to middle-class the most. Increased regulations, taxes and inflation always hit the lowest sectors the hardest. But not as many people are predicting what kinds of bad stuff will happen if Trump is reelected. The Deep State pushback against his leadership is likely to be vicious and could include everything from deliberately crashing the economy to triggering terrorist sleeper cells. As Trump himself said, “Our country right now is in the most dangerous position it’s ever been in from an economic standpoint, from a safety standpoint.. You could end up in a depression of the 1929 variety. We’re very close to that, and we’re very close to a world war.” One person noted, “I believe they will INTENTIONALLY crash the economy right as [Trump] takes office. They will intentionally make it worse than 1929, so that he is so burdened and so distracted and in such a hole that even all of his brilliance will take four years just to dig us out and get us back to ‘normal,’ and then they will succeed because he will not be able to get anything else done during that time. All efforts will go towards rebuilding our economy from the rubble.” ... Even a former FBI agent is suggesting stocking up on three to four months’ worth of food, arming yourself, and clubbing up with neighbors. Again, what does he know that we don’t know? Something is coming, folks. Something much bigger than we as individuals can fight against. Whether that something is medical, economic, societal, political, or some combination therefore – the point is, something is coming. Whatever this “something” will be, it’s almost a sure bet it will nullify our constitutional rights of speech, religion, self-defense and other critical issues. Interpret that as you will, but don’t ignore the ramifications. This “something” may also impact your financial security (if it hasn’t already) and even your food supply. Whatever steps you choose to take, take them now. Something big is coming, and we need to brace for impact. Food for thought as the election looms dead ahead.

As they raised rates a bit that was starting to change where at least the 6 month bills were getting the highest rates. These rates were still higher than the 20/30 yr bonds so still inversion territory. Now, with the recent rate decrease, it’s back to 4 week t bills at the highest rate. So maybe the rate cut was actually premature and executed for political purposes and the rates will have to increase again (after the election of course). Since the markets went up significantly after the rate cut, and knowing they will, at least temporarily, drop after resumed increases, it makes sense to sell at the high point now and buy back when it tanks. 11 posted on 09/29/2024 4:15:56 AM PDT by fruser1 [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SaveFerris Interest payments on just the federal government debt now exceed the entire Defense Department budget..

Everyone is predicting what kinds of bad stuff will happen if Kamala wins. The tax plans and economic policies she’s outlined (including raising the corporate tax rate from 21 to 28% and taxing unrealized capital gains) are making wealthy people nervous. One hedge fund billionaire said the proposed tax on unrealized capital gains on individuals making $100 million or more was particularly troubling and “would cause mass selling of almost everything – stocks, bonds, homes, art – I think it would result in a crash in the markets and an immediate, pretty quick recession.” But a Kamala presidency is predicted to impact the lower to middle-class the most. Increased regulations, taxes and inflation always hit the lowest sectors the hardest. But not as many people are predicting what kinds of bad stuff will happen if Trump is reelected. The Deep State pushback against his leadership is likely to be vicious and could include everything from deliberately crashing the economy to triggering terrorist sleeper cells. As Trump himself said, “Our country right now is in the most dangerous position it’s ever been in from an economic standpoint, from a safety standpoint.. You could end up in a depression of the 1929 variety. We’re very close to that, and we’re very close to a world war.” One person noted, “I believe they will INTENTIONALLY crash the economy right as [Trump] takes office. They will intentionally make it worse than 1929, so that he is so burdened and so distracted and in such a hole that even all of his brilliance will take four years just to dig us out and get us back to ‘normal,’ and then they will succeed because he will not be able to get anything else done during that time. All efforts will go towards rebuilding our economy from the rubble.” ... Even a former FBI agent is suggesting stocking up on three to four months’ worth of food, arming yourself, and clubbing up with neighbors. Again, what does he know that we don’t know? Something is coming, folks. Something much bigger than we as individuals can fight against. Whether that something is medical, economic, societal, political, or some combination therefore – the point is, something is coming. Whatever this “something” will be, it’s almost a sure bet it will nullify our constitutional rights of speech, religion, self-defense and other critical issues. Interpret that as you will, but don’t ignore the ramifications. This “something” may also impact your financial security (if it hasn’t already) and even your food supply. Whatever steps you choose to take, take them now. Something big is coming, and we need to brace for impact. Food for thought as the election looms dead ahead.

The tax plans and economic policies she’s outlined (including raising the corporate tax rate from 21 to 28% and taxing unrealized capital gains) are making wealthy people nervous. One hedge fund billionaire said the proposed tax on unrealized capital gains on individuals making $100 million or more was particularly troubling and “would cause mass selling of almost everything – stocks, bonds, homes, art – I think it would result in a crash in the markets and an immediate, pretty quick recession.” But a Kamala presidency is predicted to impact the lower to middle-class the most. Increased regulations, taxes and inflation always hit the lowest sectors the hardest. But not as many people are predicting what kinds of bad stuff will happen if Trump is reelected. The Deep State pushback against his leadership is likely to be vicious and could include everything from deliberately crashing the economy to triggering terrorist sleeper cells. As Trump himself said, “Our country right now is in the most dangerous position it’s ever been in from an economic standpoint, from a safety standpoint.. You could end up in a depression of the 1929 variety. We’re very close to that, and we’re very close to a world war.” One person noted, “I believe they will INTENTIONALLY crash the economy right as [Trump] takes office. They will intentionally make it worse than 1929, so that he is so burdened and so distracted and in such a hole that even all of his brilliance will take four years just to dig us out and get us back to ‘normal,’ and then they will succeed because he will not be able to get anything else done during that time.

Even a former FBI agent is suggesting stocking up on three to four months’ worth of food, arming yourself, and clubbing up with neighbors. Again, what does he know that we don’t know? Something is coming, folks. Something much bigger than we as individuals can fight against. Whether that something is medical, economic, societal, political, or some combination therefore – the point is, something is coming.

The Deep State pushback against his leadership is likely to be vicious and could include everything from deliberately crashing the economy to triggering terrorist sleeper cells. As Trump himself said, “Our country right now is in the most dangerous position it’s ever been in from an economic standpoint, from a safety standpoint.. You could end up in a depression of the 1929 variety. We’re very close to that, and we’re very close to a world war.” One person noted, “I believe they will INTENTIONALLY crash the economy right as [Trump] takes office. They will intentionally make it worse than 1929, so that he is so burdened and so distracted and in such a hole that even all of his brilliance will take four years just to dig us out and get us back to ‘normal,’ and then they will succeed because he will not be able to get anything else done during that time. All efforts will go towards rebuilding our economy from the rubble.” ... Even a former FBI agent is suggesting stocking up on three to four months’ worth of food, arming yourself, and clubbing up with neighbors. Again, what does he know that we don’t know? Something is coming, folks. Something much bigger than we as individuals can fight against. Whether that something is medical, economic, societal, political, or some combination therefore – the point is, something is coming. Whatever this “something” will be, it’s almost a sure bet it will nullify our constitutional rights of speech, religion, self-defense and other critical issues. Interpret that as you will, but don’t ignore the ramifications. This “something” may also impact your financial security (if it hasn’t already) and even your food supply. Whatever steps you choose to take, take them now. Something big is coming, and we need to brace for impact. Food for thought as the election looms dead ahead.

Title: Spot Bitcoin ETFs Record Largest Single-Day Inflow Since Early June
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/spot-bitcoin-etfs-record-largest-single-day-inflow/
Time Published: 2024-09-29T09:00:01Z
Full Content:
The market performance of the spot Bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds) in the United States has been impressive over the last few weeks. Continuing their excellent streak, the crypto investment products closed the previous trading week with their best single-day performance in almost four months. The positive investor sentiment surrounding the spot ETFs seems to have also bubbled into the Bitcoin and the general crypto market, which has recovered well from an early price slump in September. On Friday, September 27, the US spot Bitcoin ETF market registered a total net inflow of $494.27 million, the highest value since the $886 million capital influx on June 4. This was another strong daily performance by the crypto-based products, which posted over $365 million in net inflows barely 24 hours before. According to data from SoSoValue, Ark Invest and 21Shares’ ARKB led the day with an inflow of $203 million, while Fidelity’s FBTC followed in second place with a $124 million influx. In a seeming resurgence, BlackRock’s IBIT came in third with a net inflow of over $110 million. Meanwhile, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) recorded a rare positive day, with $26.15 million flowing into the product. Unsurprisingly, this value represents the fund’s highest capital influx since mid-May, reflecting the level of redemption it has experienced since the spot Bitcoin ETFs launched. As a result of Friday’s performance, the total weekly net inflows for the BTC exchange-traded funds rose to a remarkable $1.11 billion. This billion-dollar showing makes it the third consecutive week in which the US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs has recorded a cumulative weekly net inflow. The outstanding performance of the Spot Bitcoin ETFs seems to have inspired its Ethereum counterpart, as the ETH funds posted their second positive trading week since launch. The Ethereum ETFs registered a cumulative net inflow of more than $84.51 million in the past week. On Friday, the total net inflow of spot Ethereum ETFs stood around $58.6 million. Data from SoSoValue shows that Fidelity’s FETH led with a capital influx of $42.5 million, with BlackRock’s ETHA in second with $11.46 million. iShares Ethereum ETF eclipses $1bil in assets… Now in top 20% of all 3,700+ ETFs. Did this is 2 months. pic.twitter.com/iRWaxkjZxl — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) September 28, 2024 In a post on X, ETF expert Nate Geraci mentioned that the BlackRock Ethereum ETF has surpassed the $1 billion mark in terms of assets. While acknowledging that this feat was achieved in two months, Geraci revealed that ETHA is now in the top 20% of over 3,700 ETFs in the United States.

Title: ‘Fellas who were taking the piss are now looking for tips’: at home in the garden with Ireland and Munster rugby star Peter O’Mahony
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/life-style/gardening/2024/09/26/fellas-who-were-taking-the-piss-are-now-looking-for-tips-the-knock-on-effect-of-peter-omahonys-love-of-gardening/
Time Published: 2024-09-29T04:00:00Z
Full Content:
When Peter O’Mahony isn’t sinking his studs into the world’s greatest rugby pitches, he’s tending to the pristine grass on his own lawn. His love of gardening was brought to international attention during the World Cup when his mother, Caroline, held up a sign declaring she was watering his lawn while he was gone. So the question on everyone’s lips is: was it true? Did she water his lawn? “She did not,” he laughs. “She absolutely did nothing in my garden. I don’t know how she ended up with that sign, to be honest with you. I must get her doing some watering now after that.” The Munster and Ireland flanker’s interest in gardening is not a recent fad. As a child, he loved to help the gardener when he visited his grandmother Maura Conroy in Cork’s Richmond Hill. “They were my earliest memories of spending time in the garden,” he recalls. “Simple stuff, but I remember it being very enjoyable.” His grandmother died last year, but he has something to remember her by in his garden – a Japanese maple tree. “I moved it from her garden a few years ago. It has taken a while to settle in, but this is the first year it has really bloomed nicely.” The garden was one of the features that drew him and his wife Jessica to their home in Blackrock, Co Cork, 10 years ago. “We used to walk by the house a lot and say if it ever came up for sale we’d love to buy it, and all of a sudden it did.” Since then, they have been gradually redeveloping the house and garden. “It was a beautiful old cottage garden, a bit wilder than now, but lots of lovely stuff,” he recalls. When they moved in, he started with the lawn, naturally. “Some people find cutting grass a chore. I don’t. I enjoy it,” he says. As a child he mowed lawns for neighbours, including former Ireland and Munster rugby player Frankie Sheahan. “He used to give me a few bits of gear instead of money. I was delighted with the gear and chatting with Frankie at the time was great fun.” Taking on a mature garden of this size – about 200sq m (2,150sq ft) – was a daunting task, and on reflection he feels he rushed into the work. He would advise anyone in a similar situation to wait a season or two and watch how the garden grows. “But I’m quite impatient to be honest, so that was never going to happen.” Many people are now asking him for advice since he began posting about the garden on Instagram (@peteomahony), where he has amassed more than 300,000 followers. A video of him trimming the sides of the lawn on TikTok (@peteromahony6) has been viewed 5.3 million times. His Annabelle hydrangeas with their giant mophead flowers have garnered much envy. “They have taken over, to be honest with you,” he says. “I didn’t realise how big they were going to get, but it looks well in summer, that kind of block planting.” Weeded, edged, trimmed & seeded some patches. #lawncare But not everything succeeded. “I love wisteria, but I struggle with it. I tried it a couple of times in pots, but I think that’s a bad idea because it’s a hungry, vigorous plant that needs to be in the ground, so that failed a couple times,” he says. “I’ve let a couple things die, watering wise, unfortunately, being away.” Some of his plans for the garden have been held back by his heavy training schedule and travel demands. “I’d love to grow more food, but I don’t have the time at the moment,” he says. “You need to be on top of stuff all the time, but I need to be able to drop things and go for a week or two at a time. And during the summer things get crazy when you are growing food. I’ll definitely get stuck into it more when I finish playing.” But he still finds time to grow potatoes, beetroot and salad leaves. “We have some raspberries and other berries that come back every year. They need to be cut in spring and [we] try to get them picked before the birds get them. And we have a line of apple and pear trees, male and female, that pollinate themselves. Trees are foolproof once you give them the bit of pruning that they need.” He says the garden is starting to mature nicely now. “I was lucky to be able to put some mature shrubbery and plants in there that gave it some structure quite quickly.” It made a perfect backdrop when he and Jessica decided to get married in the garden during the Covid pandemic. “It was lovely. We had our immediate family in the garden and getting it ready gave me something to focus on.” While he’s happy to share his knowledge with other gardeners, he is also keen to learn from the experts. “I’ve always watched Gardeners’ World and I enjoy that. I like Adam Frost and Monty Don obviously is very enjoyable to watch,” he says. “I used to spend a lot of time in west Cork with my uncle who worked as a greenkeeper and grew a lot of his own stuff. He definitely taught me a lot.” And judging by the videos he posts on Instagram, his three children are now learning from him. Their youngest child, Ralph, seems to have inherited his father’s love of lawncare and is often seen pushing a toy lawn mower. “We have lots of songbirds and the kids have their books on recognising the different types of birds. Theo is definitely into the wildlife side of things. He’s very interested in bugs and bees and birds and fishing,” he says. “Indie then is very much into the neat and tidy stuff, keeping things where they should be. And Ralph just runs around trying to break everything up. If they want to get stuck into it, they’re more than capable of digging holes and damaging things.” Speaking of digging holes, his Ireland team-mate Bundee Aki had been threatening to damage his prized lawn for a long time. So when O’Mahony hosted a party after the Six Nations victory and Bundee grabbed a spade, he had good reason to worry. “Bundee put a few divot holes in it,” he says. “I do two or three days on the lawn every spring and autumn to level it and reseed it, so I knew that was coming up and I wasn’t too bothered. But I told him if he went near the flowers or the shrubs there would have been serious trouble.” When he first started posting about his garden on social media, a few team-mates seized the opportunity for some slagging. “But now a lot of the fellas who were taking the piss a bit are all of a sudden looking for tips on what to put where or should I put this in that pot, that sort of thing. There’s a lot of advice being requested.” With all eyes on his retirement plans now that he’s in his last season with Munster, will gardening play a role in that post-rugby future? “I certainly have plans,” he says. “I don’t know about a career, but I certainly have an interest in working on that side of things.” “I’ve always been lucky that I’ve done something that I have a huge passion for, and I have been paid well to do it so I don’t want to get stuck into something that I’m not very passionate about. I’m lucky that I am passionate about this. I’ll definitely do something in that space, but you’ll have to wait and see.” Watch out, Monty Don. There’s a new gardener in town. © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Bitcoin – THIS key signal suggests BTC’s next ATH will be in November

Bitcoin may be ready to climb to new levels over the next few months. Bitcoin (BTC) is once again at the forefront of the crypto market, driving momentum towards a much-anticipated bull market. At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $66k, sparking excitement for potential new all-time highs (ATHs) in the final quarter of the year. Here, it’s worth looking at historical data though. Particularly the 2-week Ichimoku Cloud indicator since it has accurately predicted Bitcoin’s ATHs in past cycles. With the current cycle progressing ahead of schedule, there’s probably no need to wait for the moving averages to cross. The leading spans show us when it will happen, indicating that a new high may be formed in November. Source: CryptoCon/X Many are now wondering if November will be the month Bitcoin hits new heights. Especially with institutions and traders keeping a close eye on this timeline. One key factor supporting this possibility is the repetition of the 2019 pattern. The Gaussian Channel on the 3-day BTC chart has turned red, which has historically occurred only twice – During the Covid crash and during Phase 2 of Bitcoin’s previous bull run. When this pattern last emerged during Covid 19, it led to a significant rally, pushing Bitcoin to new ATHs. If history repeats itself, Bitcoin could be poised for another major upwards move, and potentially new highs in November. Source: X However, market dynamics will ultimately determine the outcome, and it remains to be seen if this pattern will indeed lead to higher prices. Another factor that could propel Bitcoin higher is the impact of heavily borrowed USDT. Traders have been borrowing large amounts of USDT to buy Bitcoin. However, instead of pushing the price up, it initially led to a decline, causing over-leveraged traders to face losses. This type of market behavior often precedes a significant rally. Especially as retail traders are shaken out through liquidations. If the current trend continues, this will create a perfect setup for Bitcoin to surge to new highs, potentially in November. Source: Hyblock Capital Moreover, BlackRock’s continued accumulation of Bitcoin lends further confidence to the bullish outlook. Earlier this week, BlackRock (IBIT) purchased 4,460 BTC, worth $289 million, increasing its total holdings to over 362,000 BTC. This was followed by another purchase of 1,434 BTC worth $94.3 million. Recently, they added another 5,894 BTC, bringing their total holdings to 363,626 BTC, valued at $23.68 billion. BlackRock’s significant and ongoing investment in Bitcoin means that they foresee substantial price appreciation, possibly as soon as November. Source: Lookonchain/X With historical patterns, market dynamics, and institutional support all aligning, Bitcoin’s price could hit new highs in the near future. The potential for a bullish run remains strong, and traders and investors will be closely monitoring developments as November approaches. If these factors come together, Bitcoin may not only hit new ATHs but also establish itself firmly in higher price ranges for the rest of the year.

Title: Satoshi Nakamoto On Verge Of Losing Iconic Top Bitcoin Holder Crown To U.S. BTC ETFs
URL: https://zycrypto.com/satoshi-nakamoto-on-verge-of-losing-iconic-top-bitcoin-holder-crown-to-u-s-btc-etfs/

After less than a year of trading on Wall Street, U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are well on pace to surpass the estimated BTC stack of Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious inventor of the flagship cryptocurrency. Should this accumulation trend continue, the Bitcoin ETFs may collectively hold more Bitcoin than Satoshi by as early as this Christmas. In a recent post on X, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas observed that the nearly a dozen spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds now trading on American stock exchanges have amassed an astounding $17.8 billion in inflows in 2024 — representing a record-breaking year-to-date accumulation of 916,047 BTC. That is just about 84,000 BTC away from the coveted 1,000,000 BTC milestone. The ETFs are closing in on Nakamoto’s estimated 1.1 million BTC stash, which the world’s most elusive man mined in the infancy of Bitcoin and hasn’t touched after disappearing more than 13 years ago. And the spot Bitcoin ETFs now aren’t far behind. The January launch of the Bitcoin ETFs was one of the most successful ETF launches in history. Billions of dollars have hit the funds as investors previously scared off from crypto investing finally got a safe and regulated way to buy Bitcoin. The top three ETFs from BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale have accumulated 359,271 BTC, 287,153 BTC, and 254,677 BTC, respectively. In total, all the BTC ETFs need to load up on roughly 183,953 BTC to surpass Satoshi’s believed tally. If these funds continue increasing their Bitcoin reserves at the same rate, they could overtake Satoshi’s stockpile and kick him off the top. US bitcoin ETFs had good day yesterday pushing YTD flows to new high water mark of $17.8b. They’re now 92% of the way to owning 1million bitcoin and 83% of way to passing Satoshi as top holder. Tick tock.. pic.twitter.com/kTxlIzjJy6 Tolou Capital Management founder Spencer Hakimian shared Balchunas’s sentiment, predicting that “ETFs are going to be bigger than Satoshi by Christmas”, to which the Bloomberg pundit agreed, adding that BlackRock’s ETF alone will at some point top the list of Bitcoin holders. Meanwhile, a top crypto market analyst has recently posited that the fast-rising concentration of Bitcoin by spot ETFs is the main reason the United States is “regaining dominance in Bitcoin holdings,” compared to the rest of the world.

Ireland women’s head coach Scott Bemand has made two changes from the side that comfortably beat Australia 36-10 in Belfast recently for their opening WXV1 clash with New Zealand at BC Place in Vancouver on Sunday (7pm local time, 3am Monday Irish time) Stacey Flood comes in to start at fullback, with Eimear Considine switching to the right wing and Amee-Leigh Murphy Crowe retaining her place on the left wing. The other change comes in the pack with Fiona Tuite coming in for Ruth Campbell to join Dorothy Wall in the secondrow. Uncapped prop Andrea Stock has been named among the replacements. Edel McMahon will captain the side from the backrow as Bemand retains continuity from the six-try victory over Australia. “We’ve had a really good training week here in Vancouver, including a valuable hit out against France on Wednesday,” said Bemand on the eve of their opening game. “We’re facing into three matches against the top teams in the world, and New Zealand first up on Sunday present physical and ball movements threats, so the training we’ve done and the intensity of the session against France has let us tune into that. “In terms of selection, we’ve had some good competition for places in recent weeks which has led to some difficult conversations. We’re pleased with how the group are performing, and we feel we’ve got the right blend in our matchday Squad for the opening game of the campaign.” IRELAND (v New Zealand): Stacey Flood (Railway Union); Eimear Considine (UL Bohemian/Munster), Aoife Dalton (Old Belvedere/Leinster), Enya Breen (Blackrock College /Munster), Amee-Leigh Murphy Crowe (Railway Union/Munster); Dannah O’Brien (Old Belvedere/Leinster), Molly Scuffil-McCabe (Leinster); Niamh O’Dowd (Old Belvedere/Leinster), Neve Jones (Gloucester-Hartpury), Linda Djougang (Old Belvedere/Leinster); Dorothy Wall (Exeter Chiefs/Munster), Fiona Tuite (Old Belvedere/Ulster); Aoife Wafer (Blackrock College/Leinster), Edel McMahon (Exeter Chiefs/Connacht) (capt), Brittany Hogan (Old Belvedere/Ulster).

Title: Carlyle joins list of possible Thames Water rescue backers
URL: https://news.sky.com/story/carlyle-joins-list-of-possible-thames-water-rescue-backers-13223719
Time Published: 2024-09-28T13:53:00Z
Full Content:
Ofwat, the water industry regulator, will appoint an independent monitor to Thames Water as soon as next week as the utility inches closer to collapse, Sky News understands. City editor @MarkKleinmanSky Saturday 28 September 2024 16:09, UK Carlyle, the American investment giant, has become the latest global fund to weigh an investment in Thames Water as the stricken utility races to avoid being nationalised. Sky News has learnt that Carlyle, which has roughly $435bn in assets under management, is at the very preliminary stages of assessing whether an investment in Thames Water Utilities Limited (TWUL) would be viable. Britain's biggest water and wastewater company, which has about 16 million customers, is edging towards the brink of collapse after warning in recent days that its financial liquidity is set to expire months earlier than previously anticipated. It has also seen its credit rating downgraded further into junk territory by two leading rating agencies. Carlyle is one of a long list of prospective investors approached by Rothschild, the investment bank advising Thames Water's board, as the utility scrambles to raise more than £3bn in the coming months. This weekend, people close to the process confirmed that Carlyle had been approached but said it was "too early" to judge whether the firm might participate in a rescue deal through one or more of its funds. Among the others sounded out by Rothschild are Brookfield, the Canadian investment giant, and Global Infrastructure Partners, which is now owned by BlackRock. BlackRock closes in on purchase of Thames Water contractor Lanes Uncomfortable truth is that Thames Water's fate may be out of existing management's hands Thames Water lines up court dates to push through huge debt restructuring Many investors and industry analysts believe, however, that the Rothschild-led process is destined to fail given the massive financial restructuring which faces Thames Water. The company has about £16bn in debt, with approximately £10bn of that accounted for by a group of 90 funds which have appointed Jefferies and Akin Gump to represent them. That syndicate is now preparing its own rescue plan in the coming weeks, which is likely to include an enormous debt-for-equity swap that would wipe out the existing shareholders. Thames Water's future remains so shrouded in uncertainty because the industry watchdog, Ofwat, has rejected the company's initial spending plans for the next five-year regulatory period. The company is now engaged in discussions with Ofwat ahead of its final determination in December. A bridging loan of about £1bn is being contemplated by some of Thames Water's creditors, but some stakeholders remain sceptical that any new financing will be forthcoming without greater regulatory certainty. "Until the lenders know what they are bridging to, the concern deepens that they risk throwing good money after bad," said one fund. TWUL's board is said to have met in the last 48 hours to discuss the implications of its latest rating downgrades and impending liquidity shortfall. One creditor said that Ofwat was expected to appoint an independent monitor next week to scrutinise the company's progress against its turnaround plan. Ofwat, which signalled in August that it would make such an appointment, declined to comment. If new investment into Thames Water is not forthcoming before it runs out of cash, the government will have little choice but to sanction the temporary nationalisation of the company. This would be done through a Special Administration Regime (SAR), a procedure tested only once before when Bulb Energy collapsed in 2021. As part of its contingency planning for implementing a far-reaching restructuring, Thames Water has booked court dates in November to progress a rescue deal. A source close to the company said that Thames Water "continues to look at all options for extending its liquidity and raising new equity". "Reserving court dates is sensible forward planning and a part of keeping all options open."

Title: Jonathan Skrmetti’s Top 5 Successes as Tennessee’s Attorney General

(Tennessee Office of the Attorney General) Audrey Streb Audrey Streb is a member of the Young Leaders Program at The Heritage Foundation. As Tennessee’s attorney general for only two years, Republican Jonathan Skrmetti is racking up wins for conservatives in policy and law against the Biden-Harris administration and private sector actors. One of those successes looms at the U.S. Supreme Court, where in the term that begins Oct. 1 the justices are expected to take up the federal government’s attempt to kill a Tennessee law restricting gender transitions for children. In the case, called United States v. Jonathan Skrmetti, the high court will hear arguments and then decide whether the Tennessee law violates the Constitution in attempting to protect minors subjected to dangerous, life-altering medical procedures. “Twenty-five different states have enacted similar, and in some cases, identical laws,” Sarah Parshall Perry, a senior legal fellow at The Heritage Foundation, told The Daily Signal. The Tennessee ban is “very logical, very reasonable, and very constitutional,” Perry said, noting that Skrmetti is “working overtime to defend children.” The state law bans puberty blockers, hormones, and gender-transition surgeries for minors. In court filings, Skrmetti and other Tennessee officials argued that gender-reassignment surgery on minors has “exploded” in recent years and that these procedures are “unproven and risky.” Skrmetti, now 47, was sworn in as attorney general on Sept. 1, 2022. Married and the father of four, the Franklin resident previously was chief deputy attorney general under his predecessor, Herbert H. Slatery III, for three years. Mr. President, no matter the intention, changes to the law must come from Congress — not from agency bureaucrats.Separation of powers is the fundamental principle of American government. https://t.co/pyYWfs10HM Skrmetti also was chief counsel to Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, a fellow Republican. “His reputation is really stellar,” Heritage’s Perry said of Skrmetti, calling him “an excellent attorney general who is highly revered.” Skrmetti received degrees from George Washington University, the University of Oxford, and Harvard Law School. Unlike in other states, Tennessee’s chief law enforcement officer is appointed by the state Supreme Court for an eight-year term, rather than elected by voters for a four-year term. (The office, whose official title is attorney general and reporter, is thus part of Tennessee’s judicial branch rather than its executive branch.) Aides and other admirers say that as attorney general, Skrmetti has spearheaded successful lawsuits against the federal government, especially leading the charge against gender ideology mandates and government overreach. Here’s a look at what they characterize as some of his biggest challenges and successes. Skrmetti’s duties as attorney general include protecting the state’s consumers, and supporters say he has risen to that task. Skrmetti filed a lawsuit against one of the world’s largest asset managers, BlackRock Inc., in a “first-of-its-kind” consumer protection case. Tennessee successfully sued BlackRock over misleading statements about its use of ESG standards (for environmental, social, and governance considerations) in investments. Ordinary shareholders argue that ESG standards elevate over “social justice” and other progressive causes over profitability and good business practices. Skrmetti has been at the forefront of battles with progressives over gender ideology, most notably foiling the Biden-Harris administration’s proposed Title IX changes. The administration’s adjustments would have mandated that biological boys be allowed to play girls sports at school and to use girls’ restrooms and locker rooms, among other things. Despite facing several challenges from the Biden-Harris Justice Department, Skrmetti successfully defended Tennessee’s ban on so-called gender-affirming care for children. This is the case pending at the U.S. Supreme Court. The attorney general also won a U.S. District Court case against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which sought to mandate that medical providers perform, and insurers cover, some sex-change procedures. Skrmetti also went to the District Court as well as the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit to successfully defend Tennessee’s policy forbidding a change in the biological sex listed on birth certificates. Skrmetti also has had success in responding to the Biden-Harris administration’s undoing of border security measures imposed by the Trump-Pence administration. He sued the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which oversees border-related agencies, over its refusal to share records regarding the “catch and release” of illegal aliens who were transported to Tennessee. The case is called Tennessee v. Mayorkas, after DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, an appointee of President Joe Biden. Early this year, Skrmetti successfully sued the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission over its revised regulations implementing the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. The agency’s revision would have forced employers to pay for their employees’ abortions, he argued. “I’m proud to lead the coalition fighting to protect the rule of law against this unconstitutional federal overreach,” Skrmetti said in a public statement. “Congress passed the bipartisan Pregnant Workers Fairness Act to protect mothers-to-be and promote healthy pregnancies, and the EEOC’s attempt to rewrite that law into an abortion mandate is illegal.” When it comes to government and private sector policies focused on or mandating so-called DEI—diversity, equity, and inclusion—Skrmetti has been proactive in expressing concerns. The Tennessee attorney general last year co-led a 13-state letter that warned Fortune 100 companies about DEI practices setting up racial preferences in hiring, promotions, and other decisions. “As the Supreme Court recently emphasized, both our Constitution and our civil rights laws guarantee every American the right to be free from racial discrimination,” Skrmetti said in a press release. “The court’s reasoning means that companies, no matter their motivation, cannot treat people differently based on the color of their skin,” he said. “Corporate America continues to have many avenues to help disadvantaged people and communities of all races without resorting to crude racial line-drawing. Trust in the legacy media is at an all-time low. That’s because they are out of touch, deliberately lie to the American public, and ignore conservative audiences.

Now, as fears are swirling the U.S. dollar is on "the verge of a total collapse," BlackRock's USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (Buidl) is being used to back a new stablecoin, described as a "key milestone" in the "$16 trillion by 2030" race to tokenize finance.

Crypto company Ethena, which earlier this year launched a so-called synthetic U.S. dollar stablecoin called USDe that's swelled to a $2.6 billion circulating supply, has announced a new stablecoin called UStb that will invest its reserves in BlackRock's Buidl via real-world asset tokenization platform Securitize. "UStb will be fully backed by Blackrock Buidl in partnership with Securitize, enabling a separate fiat stablecoin product alongside USDe," Ethena﻿'s official X account posted. "As the largest tokenized U.S. Treasuries fund with over $522 million in assets, Buidl provides UStb with a secure foundation," Securitize's account posted. "This collaboration represents a key milestone in the evolution of tokenized finance, bringing together leading innovations in stablecoins and real-world asset tokenization." In May, BlackRock led a $47 million strategic investment in its Buidl partner Securitize, widely seen as a long-term bet on crypto, with the fund allowing investors within crypto ecosystems to earn dividends on the Treasury fund while keeping assets on-chain. BlackRock, which manages over $10 trillion globally on behalf of clients, led the campaign last year to bring a fully-fledged spot bitcoin ETF to the U.S., winning approval for its IBIT and a fleet of other spot bitcoin ETFs in January.

Fink revealed last year that he believes the tokenization of assets on blockchains will drive a "revolution" on Wall Street, as everything—from stock markets, pre-IPO stocks, hedge funds, infrastructure projects, commodities, alternate investment instruments and private credit—becomes tokenized. "At BlackRock, we believe that tokenization has the potential to drive a significant transformation in capital markets infrastructure," BlackRock’s global head of strategic ecosystem partnerships Joseph Chalom told Fortune in May. "Our investment in Securitize is another step in the evolution of our digital assets strategy." Earlier this month, a report from crypto company Chainlink found the current value of tokenized assets is almost $120 billion, with ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency after bitcoin, holding 58% of all tokenized assets. In 2022, Boston Consulting Group found "the total size of illiquid asset tokenization globally would be $16 trillion by 2030," while in 2021, the World Economic Forum estimated that "$867 trillion of value is ready to be disrupted by tokenization."

Title: ‘This is the last Bitcoin halving that matters’ – Exec

Here’s why this crypto VC founder believes this might be last important BTC halving. Previous Bitcoin halving cycles have been followed by BTC’s price rallying explosively. This phenomenon has made most cycle analysts and the overall market expect a parabolic price rally after every event. According to a recent Blackrock report, BTC’s value has risen by 592x since its debut in 2009. Subsequent exponential returns were recorded after each of the past three halving events too. In 2013, for instance, BTC saw 555x returns, while in 2017, investors saw 104x gains. After the 2020 halving, it posted another 21x returns. And, the trend is expected to repeat after 2024’s event. Source: BlackRock However, Charles Edwards, founder of crypto VC firm Capriole Investments, believes this might be the last halving event that drives a parabolic BTC rally. He said, “This is the last Halving cycle that matters.” Edwards argued that the next halving cycle won’t impact BTC because it’s already the hardest asset, with a very low inflation rate below gold. “The next halving won’t matter much because the inflation rate of BTC is below gold. So, a massive price drop won’t affect it much.” Edwards acknowledged though that the current cycle is not yet priced amid potential nation-state adoption. However, he noted that the halving cycles will be irrelevant by 2028. “You’re not going to get massive price rallies because the halving events are so well known, and the BTC mining industry is so efficient now. I think the 4-year halving cycles will not be relevant in four years.” Here, it’s worth noting that market cycle analyst Stockmoney Lizards projected a possible price target of $200k—$260k per BTC for this cycle top. This could happen by Q4 2025. Source: X In short, there is still more room for BTC growth before it hit this cycle top. The world’s largest digital asset retested $66k on Friday and was valued at $65.9k at press time. That puts it only 8% away from its range-high at $71k.

U.Today - Michael Saylor, Bitcoin permabull and the co-founder of MicroStrategy juggernaut that stacks BTC, has published a tweet to highlight Bitcoin’s high performance, which has massively surpassed that of leading assets in conventional financial markets. Over the past few days, digital gold has demonstrated an increase of more than 5%, reclaiming the $66,000 price mark. As of September this year, BTC shows annual gains of 51%. The second largest after it comes the Magnificent 7 stocks index (which includes such monsters as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)) with 27%, followed by S&P 500 (14% rise), real estate (10% increase) and gold (7%). As for the market of bonds, it has entered the red zone, plunging by 4%. Highlighting Bitcoin’s success, Saylor tweeted, “Bitcoin is winning.” On Friday, Saylor reacted to Bitcoin recapturing $66,000 by publishing a tweet saying “Bitcoin is Storm-Proof.” He also responded to a tweet by a renowned investor Raoul Pal after Pal stated that his core crypto bets include SOL and DOGE. Saylor stated that “Bitcoin misses” Pal, to which the investor replied that while he still believes in Bitcoin 1,000%, he looks for assets that can bring large profits quickly, even if high risks are involved. Since Wednesday last week, Bitcoin has added more than 10%, soaring from $59,410 after the Fed Reserve announced a 50 basis point interest rate cut first time in the last four years. This was the initial driver of the Bitcoin price, followed by a similar announcement by the Central Bank of China and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) purchasing a mammoth amount of Bitcoin this week. In the past four days, its spot Bitcoin ETF IBIT has seen consecutive inflows of $388.19 million in total. This article was originally published on U.Today

Wokeness is stuff that most Americans of all races and genders can't stand. If they ate this stuff up, Disney—which has been indoctrinating children in gender fluidity through its programming—wouldn't have a stock price that hasn't moved in eight years. Bud Light would still be the nation's No 1. beer, not No. 3, after featuring a trans woman activist in a commercial. BlackRock would be advertising its fealty to Environmental, Social, and Governance investing instead of running away from it. I would like to credit the conservative media with these wins. But a closer look at what is still a modest unwinding of woke—a sometimes overused term, but one that still so perfectly describes the progressive groupthink that seeks to remake the country and its culture into a left-wing hellhole—shows it has more to do with deep reporting by individual reporters (e.g., Chris Rufo), viral social-media moments, and everyday Americans simply exposing the perniciousness and idiocy of this ideology. The conservative media—on this issue and many others—is a little more than an opinion-generating machine, and all too often a negative feedback loop. It leaves the reporting to last and misses an opportunity to have the impact that the mainstream media still does in driving the political and cultural conversation. This may be a harsh conclusion, but it's the reason why I wanted to subject the subject to journalism in my latest book, Go Woke Go Broke: The Inside Story of the Radicalization of Corporate America. I hate the label "mainstream media," but for lack of a better word, this is a world I've occupied, working on the news side of the Wall Street Journal covering financial scandal, Newsweek when it was a major print magazine, at CNBC, where I covered the financial crisis and broke most of the major stories at that time. I've been at Fox and Fox Business with a regular column in the New York Post for the past 14 years. Some would call those outlets "conservative media," yet I never changed the way I do my job, nor do my supervisors want me to. I've written and reported all my books the same way, whether it's exposing Wall Street scams, insider trading, the roots and impact of the 2008 collapse, or how progressivism has become an integral and insidious part of corporate American culture. I engage subjects. I check facts. I question my underlying thesis throughout my reporting. I try to be fair to people I'm reporting on. My journalism moves stocks and has changed corporate behavior. In that spirit, I spent a lot of time speaking with someone at the center of corporate wokeness, a man named Larry Fink, the CEO and founder of BlackRock. Fink is maybe the most powerful financier in America given Blackrock's size: It controls more than $10 trillion in assets. That means from his office in New York City, Fink holds stocks in the world's biggest companies, currencies of every industrial power, stocks, crypto, you name it. He's also used his power to spread corporate wokeness through ESG techniques, and in the process has become a target of the conservative movement, so much so, he has backed off his allegiance to the investing technique. Why Fink initially wanted to change boardroom behavior to scale back oil drilling, proceeded to expand DEI, then reverted is a great story. To his credit, he came clean, and it makes for a fascinating read. I'm probably the only reporter who got Fink to fess up about why he went woke in the first place. Based on reader responses, my book is more compelling because of it. I did what good reporters do—I got inside the head of my subject and, in this case, explained how the most powerful man in finance arrived at the place where he shouldn't have been. But this publication's reviewer, Paul Tice, thinks this is an example of some sort of malfeasance ("Woke CEOs and the Financial Fear Factor," September 15, 2024). He accused me of using "kid glove treatment on Wall Street." I was blown away by that characterization. So was Fink, doubtlessly. (I'm told he doesn't share that view of the book's treatment of him. So too presumably was the reviewer for the Wall Street Journal, who writes, "Mr. Gasparino gives us entertaining (and informative) accounts of corporate blunders in the name of wokeness. ... Among the villains trying to ram ESG down our throats are Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock; Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase; David Solomon, the CEO of Goldman Sachs..." I don't know Mr. Tice, but I can use that invention called The Google, and here's what I found. He's a longtime Wall Street money manager. In 2009, BlackRock—yes Larry Fink's BlackRock—purchased the hedge fund he worked at. Mr. Tice remained at BlackRock until 2015. The head of the hedge fund that BlackRock purchased, Rick Rieder, stayed and is now one of the most powerful people at the firm as head of fixed income. Mr. Tice is now a critic of ESG, which is great, but his background of working at BlackRock, not for a minute, but for six years in a senior capacity, and maybe the circumstances of his departure, should have been disclosed to readers. It wasn't. He was merely described as a member of a think tank who teaches at New York University and wrote a book on ESG. Not a word about working at BlackRock and his experience working for Larry Fink. Yes, good journalism is not only about reporting, but also adding essential context. Charles Gasparino is a Fox Business Network senior correspondent, New York Post columnist, and author of Go Woke, Go Broke: The Inside Story of the Radicalization of Corporate America. Paul Tice responds: Rather than questioning my motives and qualifications for reviewing his new book, Charles Gasparino should address the substance of my criticism. In his book, Gasparino tries to make the case that Wall Street has embraced sustainability because ESG has made firms like BlackRock "uber-wealthy," even though such an argument directly contradicts the premise of his work. As his Go Woke, Go Broke title clearly states, companies that follow progressive environmental and social policies don't outperform financially and often destroy enterprise value, which necessarily means that investment firms cannot achieve better portfolio returns by pursuing ESG investment strategies. Gasparino never acknowledges this core cognitive dissonance in his book. In trying to make the case, moreover, that ESG has been a huge "moneymaker" for BlackRock—thereby causing every Wall Street competitor to follow suit—he fails to back up his argument with facts. While Gasparino correctly notes that funds carrying a sustainable label can charge higher fees, he ignores the reality that, despite all the hype, ESG funds still comprise a very small minority of assets under management (AUM) across the industry. At BlackRock, sustainable funds (excluding cash management accounts) equated to just 6 percent of total AUM at year-end 2023, with more than half of these comprised of passive ESG funds with skinnier fee structures. Nonetheless, Gasparino credits almost all the rise in BlackRock's share price over the past two decades to the firm's strategic focus on sustainability. As he writes, "It is no accident that BlackRock's stock price appreciated more than 500 percent since it offered its first ESG fund [in 2005], compared to a 272 percent rise in the S&P." Given BlackRock's transformational acquisition of Barclays Global Investors in 2009 and the protracted zero-interest rate market environment throughout the 2010s, this is a ludicrous statement. It should come as no surprise that a stock like BlackRock's with a beta well above 1.0 would significantly outperform the overall market during an extended bull run. Gasparino also attributes the sharp swing in BlackRock's AUM over 2022-2023 to changes in its public ESG stance, even though the firm's $1.5 trillion AUM round-trip over these two volatile years was entirely owing to moves in the financial markets. In 2022, when "the stench of ESG … turned off many customers" according to Gasparino, BlackRock still had $307 billion of net fund inflows, dwarfing the roughly $4 billion of capital that was publicly pulled by nine disgruntled red states that year. In 2023, Gasparino asserts that BlackRock's "assets began returning as it moved away from ESG messaging," even though no investment money had left the prior year because of ESG. Lastly, Gasparino tries to explain BlackRock's sustainability focus by highlighting the pressure placed on the firm by blue state pension fund clients such as the retirement accounts run by New York City Comptroller (and now Democratic mayoral candidate) Brad Lander. While it is true that BlackRock manages money for several progressively minded investors, Gasparino steps on his own line by using bad numbers to embellish the point. Contrary to Gasparino's claim, Lander does not play "a leading role in managing more than $20 trillion in pension money." The actual figure is $264 billion as of year-end 2023, so Gasparino is off by a factor of 75. The above nuggets provide context for my contention that Gasparino bends over backward in his book to rationalize the ESG behavior of Wall Street firms, although I was being kind when I described his analysis as hyperbole. But what do I know? I only worked in the financial industry for 40 years. I am no match for the journalism and reporting skills of Charles Gasparino.

Acclaimed anime-style 3D RPG Punishing: Gray Raven is joining forces with another anime blockbuster this month with the massive Blazing Simulacrum patch. It’s a match made in neon heaven. BLACK★ROCK SHOOTER is a A-Rank Attacker Omniframe, which makes her obtainable within 10 pulls. Even you are a new player, it’s quite easy for you to get this character. The battle design highlights the coolness of “BLACK★ROCK SHOOTER,” staying true to the original character’s image. With a cold expression and a blue flame blazing in his left eye, She wields the powerful “Bladed Cannon” with her right arm. Her left arm bears a “Black Blade” that extends to a sharp point, concealing a deadly threat. This combination creates a vibrant “black” appearance, showcasing the allure of a real attacker. With the release of this new character comes her exclusive weapon, ★Rock Cannon. She will also feature an exclusive coating called Elder Flame, which perfectly aligns with her style and expresses her ambition to battle and win. The new patch story will take place in a limited-time world where BLACK★ROCK SHOOTER will meet her fateful enemy, “Dead Master,” and continue their destined battle. Four SFX coatings to collect, including two that nobody has seen before: Nightbreaker for Lucia: Crimson Weave and Snowbreak Bloom for Liv: Luminance. While Solitary Dream for Bianca: Stigmata and Vox Solaris for Selene Capriccio will have a rerun. There’s a new Chessboard Realms mode, too, allowing you to see what happens when you let a deadly killer loose on a chessboard. The game takes place in a world in which an army of deranged cyborgs, infected with a biomechanical virus called The Punishing, have driven human beings to the point of extinction and ousted them from planet earth. The survivors are eking out a miserable existence aboard the space station Babylonia while you, the commandant, assemble a crack army in preparation for a make-or-break counterattack.

Title: AIL: Terenure seek to back up impressive opening victory when they travel to Young Munster

There might only be two teams unbeaten after two rounds of the Energia AIL Division 1A come teatime this afternoon, namely the winners of the Clontarf-Garryowen and Young Munster-Terenure matches. All victorious on the opening day, Terenure will seek to back up their victory at home over the champions Cork Con when they travel to Young Munster, who themselves won away to UCD. However, Terenure last won at Tom Clifford Park in February 2017, and they travel without last week’s match-winner Fintan Gunne, due to his Leinster call-up, and also their go-to centre Peter Sylvester, who played his 50th AIL game for the club last week before moving to Miami. The experienced Alan Bennie and pacy Conor Phillips start, with Craig Adams shifting to midfield alongside Aran Egan, as the former Leinster back Chris Cosgrave is tried at 10. It’s a potent looking backline, if lacking Sylvester’s physicality. The fit-again Jordan Coughlan returns in a strong bench. Similarly, Young Munster are without last week’s double try-scorer, Shay McCarthy, as he is with Munster in Parma, injured fullback Patrick Buckley and suspended tighthead Paul Allen. Shane O’Leary, Jack Shaw and Peter Meyer come in. As Bryan Fitzgerald is also on Munster duty, Garryowen bring Jack Delaney into midfield in one of four changes for their trek to Castle Avenue, with fullback Jamie Heuston, winger Colm Quilligan and lock Oisin Cooke starting. With Aitzol King called up to the Leinster squad, Clontarf have brought in Sean Reilly, Victor Allen and Peter Maher, as Andrew Smith shifts to fullback behind an unchanged pack and halves. The other opening day winners, Ballynahinch, travel to Temple Hill where Con have brought in centre Eoghan Smith and the Munster loosehead Mark Donnelly. Lansdowne, at home to UCD, recall winger Cathal Eddy and promote flanker Paul Wilson, the Gonzaga captain in their Schools Cup win two seasons ago. The students’ suffered injuries to both scrumhalves, Rob Gilsenan and Michael Moloney, and flanker Mark Hernan. They make eight changes and two positional switches, as Bobby Sheehan moves from hooker to blindside. St Mary’s make four changes for their trip to Armagh, with Ethan Baxter replacing suspended captain Ronan Waters after his red card against Clontarf. In 1B last week’s five home winners are all on the road against sides who lost away. Nenagh Ormond travel to Blackrock while Shannon and Old Wesley, each beaten in the semi-finals last season, meet in a reprise of the promotion final two seasons ago which Shannon won, and UCC host Highfield in a Cork derby. Two of last week’s winners in 2A meet when Corinthians host Greystones. The promoted Galway club won 27-10 away to Ballynahinch last week with a pack whose oldest player is 24 and a backline, featuring double-try scoring 19-year-old Tomás Farthing, whose oldest player is 21. Free-scoring Instonians host Ballymena in their first home game in 2A for 12 years and Navan begin their centenary celebrations in earnest when hosting Old Crescent, while in 2C Sydney Parade hosts its first AIL game in 22 years when Monkstown entertain Bruff. Division 1A: City of Armagh v St. Mary’s College, Palace Grounds; Clontarf v Garryowen, Castle Avenue; Cork Constitution v Ballynahinch, Temple Hill; Lansdowne v UCD, Aviva Stadium Back Pitch; Young Munster v Terenure College, Tom Clifford Park.

Title: ‘Every year the women’s AIL gets stronger’ – Railway Union’s Niamh Byrne determined to go one step further than last year

Photo: Seb Daly/Sportsfile Niamh Byrne and her Railway Union team-mates have a big incentive to go all the way in the AIL this year, having lost last year’s final to UL Bohs. Moving on wasn’t easy, but in time they came to appreciate what was a ground-breaking day for women’s rugby. It was the first time the AIL final was held in the Aviva Stadium, having previously taken place in Donnybrook, going ahead in conjunction with the men’s decider as a double-header. Byrne, the Railway Union captain and former Ireland sevens and Leinster player, says the landmark occasion is a testament to the progress being made in women’s club rugby. “The day itself was absolutely wonderful,” she says. “The first time the women got to play the AIL final at the Aviva and the first time it was a double-header with the men. “It was great to play a part in that. The weather was unbelievable, leading to a really great atmosphere. Getting the bus in, the whole works, it all made for a brilliant experience.” The game more than lived up to the occasion, producing 13 tries as UL Bohs edged the Sandymount club 48-38 in a rip-roaring thriller. The new season begins this weekend and Railway Union are eager to get off to a winning start in their clash with local rivals Old Belvedere. “We’ve a lot of new girls down, with a lot of the team returning from last year, too. We’ve worked hard in pre-season, in the gym and on the pitch. “Unfortunately for us, we didn’t get the win last year and that was tough to take, but in time, you look back and say it really was such a great day out, a great spectacle, and a brilliant showcase of the standard of women’s club rugby in Ireland.” On the ground, increasing numbers at underage level is a sign of positive momentum in the women’s club rugby scene. The make-up of the Railway Union squad is emblematic of the growth, where a number of 18-year-olds are taking their first steps in senior rugby, guided by more experienced team-mates, such as Irish rugby legend Lindsay Peat, still going strong at 43. Byrne is somewhere in the middle, having begun playing as a youngster in Mullingar. “Every year the women’s AIL gets stronger,” says the centre. “Underage structures are improving. “There are under-18s ready to come in which there wouldn’t have always been, and a lot of those girls make that jump to senior rugby, and we’ll always welcome them,” she stresses. “The boys in my class in Mullingar set up the girls' underage team. We were all dragged down the first night, had no intention of playing rugby, I used to swim and play hockey. “After a few sessions, I decided rugby was for me. [I] played Leinster underage and senior and was contracted to the sevens after college.” Byrne would encourage anyone to come down to the club and get involved, and now her focus is on regaining the crown they last won in 2022. Blackrock, Old Belvedere and last year’s champs UL Bohs look to be Railway Union’s main rivals again – no team outside of those four have won a title in the last 20 years – and Byrne is excited to renew acquaintances. “Two of those rivals are obviously very close neighbours to the Railway team [Blackrock and Old Belvedere], so you go into those games knowing it’s going to be a very physical game. “There’s a lot of work to be done between now and April, but the goal of every season is to win it. “Last year was great, but the result does stick in the mind and we want to make up for that.”

Title: Assets in actively managed ETFs top $1 trillion worldwide

By Suzanne McGee (Reuters) - Assets in actively managed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) worldwide hit a record $1 trillion at the end of August, according to data provider ETFGI, boosted by easier regulations and a wave of product innovation. Active ETFs seek to outperform the indexes they are benchmarked to, including the S&P 500, the Nasdaq 100 and the Russell 1000 Growth Index. Bear Stearns launched the first active ETF in 2008. While they make up just 7% of all global ETFs, active ETFs have accounted for 30% of all inflows into the funds as a whole for the last several years, Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research at State Street (NYSE:STT) Research, told Reuters in the latest episode of Inside ETFs. A key growth catalyst, analysts said, was the 2019 regulation popularly known as the “ETF rule,” which streamlined the complex process of winning approval for active ETFs from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Assets in the active ETF category have grown about 10-fold since 2019, according to data from ETF.com. Growth has continued this year. As of Aug. 31, active ETF assets soared 42%, data from ETFGI showed. The more relaxed regulations have also fueled innovation, Bartolini said, encouraging issuers to take novel approaches to products as they vie for investor dollars. Active ETFs run the gamut from the plain vanilla, such as the BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Large Cap Value ETF to more niche offerings, like the AdvisorShares Vice ETF, which invests in shares of companies involved in the alcohol, tobacco and cannabis industries. "These regulatory rule changes have actually accelerated some of the more novel approaches that ETF issuers can bring to the marketplace," Bartolini said. Active ETFs include products that have been wildly volatile, such as Ark Innovation ETF, which soared 152% in 2020, only to slump 23% the following year. So far in 2024, it has lost 9.74%, compared with a 20% gain in the S&P 500. Some can also magnify risk, such as leveraged ETFs tied to the performance of individual stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Nor are all active ETF issuers faring well. The 10 largest issuers accounted for 75% of active ETF assets, according to a Morningstar report from earlier this year. The bottom half of active equity ETFs have only 3% of all the group's assets. "ETFs that repackage old-fashioned stock-picking have struggled to attract assets," said Jack Shannon, manager research analyst at Morningstar, in a report published on Tuesday. Tim Huver, senior vice president of ETF Servicing at Brown Brothers Harriman, said active ETFs may require investors to do more due diligence. Nonetheless, he believes the category has reached a turning point. A Brown Brothers survey found that more than 90% of ETF investors intended to increase their allocation to active ETFs, Huver said. "I think the second trillion is going to arrive much more rapidly than it took us to get to the first trillion," Huver said.

Title: Report: Connected TV Ad Platform MNTN Considering Early 2025 IPO

Connected TV advertising platform MNTN is reportedly considering going public in early 2025. The firm, whose chief creative officer is actor Ryan Reynolds, selected Morgan Stanley to work on its initial public offering (IPO), Bloomberg reported Friday (Sept. 27), citing unnamed sources. Deliberations around the IPO are ongoing, and details could change, according to the report. MNTN did not immediately reply to PYMNTS’ request for comment. The company’s advertising software includes targeting, measurement and automated optimization technology designed to help brands promote themselves on connected TVs, according to the report. In 2021, MNTN acquired Reynolds’ creative agency, Maximum Effort, and raised $119 million in a Series D financing round, per the report. The company’s Series D round closed in the fourth quarter of 2021 and was announced by the firm in a February 2022 press release. The round was co-led by funds and accounts managed by BlackRock and Fidelity Management and Research Co. MNTN said in the release that the number of viewers making streaming their preferred way of watching television had exploded, that large advertisers were moving to connected TV because of this growth in consumption, and that MNTN’s software enables advertisers to buy connected TV inventory and measure its performance in real time. Patrick Pohlen, chief financial officer at MNTN, said in the release: “I’ve worked in venture and technology for over 25 years but this company and our new partners are special. Connected TV is transforming the advertising landscape and MNTN is leading the charge.” In a blog post announcing MNTN’s acquisition of Maximum Effort, MNTN CEO Mark Douglas and Reynolds wrote that the combination brought together tech and creative to simplify and accelerate advertising. “We believe the meteoric rise of Connected TV presents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to bring media and creative closer together,” they wrote. “The demand for easy-to-use tech and superb, fast-turn creative is certain to climb thanks to an increase in inventory and advertisers new to TV — many of whom can’t afford upfronts. Independently, our companies have embraced and excelled because of our commitment to simplicity and speed. Together, we think the opportunities are endless.” We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: BlackRock Buys Massive Amount of Bitcoin

U.Today - As recently reported by Arkham Intelligence, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) - the giant hedge fund with over $10 trillion in assets under management - bought more Bitcoin (BTC) this week than any ETF issuer has sold in the past three weeks. The purchases were made for BlackRock's own IBIT spot Bitcoin ETF and totaled the equivalent of $388.19 million over the past four days. As of today, the hedge fund's total cryptocurrency holdings amount to 362,193 BTC, or the equivalent of $23.79 billion. For comparison, this is over 100,000 BTC more than the amount held by the nearest competitor, Grayscale. There is no mystery behind such groundbreaking activity from BlackRock's side toward the major cryptocurrency. As the fund's head of digital assets recently revealed, for them, Bitcoin is not a risky gamble, but rather a scarce, global, decentralized, nonsovereign asset that has no country risk and no traditional counterparty risk. From the perspective of a $10 trillion asset management firm, BTC is more like digital gold than a beta to the NASDAQ and tech stocks in general. BlackRock's interest in cryptocurrencies does not end there, however, as the fund recently launched its spot Ethereum ETF solution. These ETFs have not seen the same hype as those focused on Bitcoin, but the number of ETH in BlackRock's wallet is growing regardless. It remains to be seen if we will see the appropriate level of acceptance for Ethereum from the financial giant, but at least the trend seems to be there.

Title: OpenAI CEO Sam Altman branded "podcasting bro" for his reportedly absurd plan to "take $7 trillion and many years to build 36 semiconductor plants and additional data centers" to fulfill his ambitious AI vision

Lack of sufficient computing power and AI chips limits AI advances, but OpenAI CEO Sam Altman reportedly has an "audacious plan" to bypass these issues. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. While Generative AI allows significant tech corporations like OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google to tap into new and unexplored opportunities, it demands a ridiculous computing power and cooling water. Reports indicate that the world could be on the brink of the most significant technological breakthrough with AI, but there won't be enough electricity to power its advances by 2025. Google and Microsoft consume more electricity than 100 countries to power their AI advances. Last year, we learned that Microsoft Copilot and ChatGPT use up to 1 bottle of water for cooling per query. Recent research by the University of California further built on this premise, revealing that OpenAI's GPT-4 model (often considered mildly embarrassing at best) consumes up to three water bottles to generate a mere 100 words. OpenAI and Microsoft have openly highlighted their plans to address some of the issues preventing further advancement in AI, including investing $100 billion in a new project dubbed Stargate to free themselves from an overreliance on NVIDIA for AI chips. Microsoft recently partnered with BlackRock to raise $100 billion to 'emancipate themselves from the shackles' of insufficient power and increase data centers for their ambitious AI dreams. Aside from looking at nuclear fusion as an alternative power source for AI advances, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has reportedly been curating an "audacious plan" to address the firm's computing power needs (via The New York Times). These plans are closely tied to investors in the United Arab Emirates and chip makers in Asia. According to sources with knowledge of Altman's ambitions, he reportedly pitched a multitrillion-dollar plan to investors, which would help build chip fabs and data centers worldwide. These plans would set OpenAI in a unique position to push its AI advances to the next level with unlimited computing power. As you may know, investors in the AI landscape recently raised concern over Microsoft's spending on AI efforts after its latest earnings call, citing difficulty in establishing a clear path to profitability in the category. Interesting;y, market analysts and experts claim OpenAI's reported bankruptcy claims in the next few months, with projections of $5 billion losses, are part of any startup's growing curve. With Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Apple lining up to participate in the ChatGPT maker's latest round of funding, pushing its market capitalization to over $150 billion, OpenAI could become the world's dominant AI company, given its unique enterprise and consumer position. As part of Sam Altman's plan to develop next-gen AI models, he'd require the United Arab Emirates to fund his ambitions by building multiple chip-making plants worldwide that cost up to $43 billion each. This plan would allow chipmakers like NVIDIA to meet the high demand for AI chips, especially in the Emirates, which has access to electrical power. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. To put Altman's plans into perspective, he told TSMC executives that it would "take $7 trillion and many years to build 36 semiconductor plants and additional data centers to fulfill his vision." According to a TMSC spokesman, the company is open to discussing expanding semiconductor development. However, it's more concerned about its current global expansion projects. TSMC execs reportedly found Altman's ambitions for AI absurd, branding him a "podcasting bro." An OpenAI spokesman responded to the claims that OpenAI pitches multi-trillion-dollar projects by refuting them and indicating that the firm isn't considering following that path for its AI ventures. What OpenAI is specifically exploring is on the scale of hundreds of billions," the spokesman added.

Title: Bitcoin climbs to $66,000, marking best September performance in history

The rally comes amid market optimism driven by the Fed's rate cut, economic stimulus in China and sustained demand from institutional players in the US. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Bitcoin (BTC) surged past $66,000 on Sept. 27 as New York opened for trading, reaching a two-month high to record its best September performance on record. The rally comes amid economic stimulus measures in China and the US Federal Reserve policy decision to cut interest rates, which have helped sustain recent market optimism. The surge is also driven by sustained institutional demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs. According to CryptoSlate data, Bitcoin was trading at $66,200 as of press time after bears failed to pull the price back to lower levels immediately after the surge. However, the ensuing trading hours have seen subdued momentum, with a pullback to retest support at $65,000 likely in the coming hours. Institutional demand played a significant role in Bitcoin’s latest rally, with major asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity Investments recording significant increases in their holdings following the rate cuts. Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw inflows of $365 million this week, the highest in over two months, indicating a sustained appetite from investors seeking exposure to the digital asset. The demand for Bitcoin ETFs has surged as investors seek alternatives to traditional assets amidst economic uncertainty. Many institutions are positioning themselves ahead of potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts expected later this year. Several other institutional players have followed suit, with hedge funds and pension funds increasing their allocations to Bitcoin amid a broader search for yield and diversification. The appeal of Bitcoin as a store of value has strengthened as inflationary concerns grow and traditional assets such as bonds deliver lower returns. The upward pressure on Bitcoin’s price has also been supported by developments in China, where a wave of economic stimulus measures has boosted confidence in global markets. The Shanghai Composite Index recorded its best week since 2008, providing further momentum for Bitcoin’s rally. The digital asset has mirrored these gains, rising over 3% week-to-date, as capital flows from both institutional investors and favorable macroeconomic conditions continue to push its value higher. As traders speculate on the possibility of another Fed rate cut in November, optimism has grown across global markets, with the S&P 500 reaching new highs alongside Bitcoin’s rise. The CME Group’s FedWatch Tool places the odds of another 50-basis-point cut at 52%, boosting hopes of further liquidity in the market. Lower interest rates are seen as favorable for Bitcoin and other risk assets, as they reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets and inject more liquidity into financial markets. With institutional demand remaining robust and macroeconomic conditions continuing to evolve in favor of risk assets, Bitcoin’s strong September performance could pave the way for further gains in October, a month historically positive for the crypto market. Analysts remain bullish, with some pointing to familiar patterns of strong price action following periods of institutional accumulation. As economic uncertainty persists and both central bank policies and global financial markets remain in flux, Bitcoin’s recent price movement highlights its evolving role as a key player in the financial landscape. At the time of press 6:32 pm UTC on Sep. 27, 2024, Bitcoin is ranked #1 by market cap and the price is up 0.69% over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin has a market capitalization of $1.3 trillion with a 24-hour trading volume of $34.61 billion. Learn more about Bitcoin › At the time of press 6:32 pm UTC on Sep. 27, 2024, the total crypto market is valued at at $2.31 trillion with a 24-hour volume of $84.2 billion.

Title: Leaders That Mislead – Manipulators and the Manipulated

In modern times, governments joined at the hip with the ‘world order’ of mega-corporations and mega-banks have lost sight of what is actually needed for the wellbeing of the population. For decades, various ‘world order’ type policies emanating from the likes of the United Nations (UN) and the World Economic Forum (WEF); and debt-packages emanating from private international banking have been adopted by national governments Worldwide supposedly for the wellbeing of the populace. We are told this is to save us: However, these policies and economic ‘bailouts’ that were launched are more like chains around the neck, or ‘boats of stone’ that are slowly sinking, taking the general populace down with them. This is evident in policies that affect the lives of almost everyone on the planet. Policies that invariably mean you have to pay for the ‘fixing of the latest concocted problem’, via a new tax, a new regulation, or a change in your freedom or lifestyle. Take for example policies based on the bogus science of CO2-induced or methane-induced climate change; including the nonsense that dairy farmers must reduce cow numbers to combat climate change (i.e. reduce methane emissions). As more small farmers go bankrupt due to increased expense and regulation, mega-corporations buy more land and increase their control of the food system, unleashing more genetically-modified foods, while local farming, local resilience suffers. Who can forget the fake Covid-19 pandemic, the lockdowns and mass injurious vaccination that ensued, see also the book No Worries No Virus. Then there is the ongoing deceptive United Nations Sustainable Developments Goals involving Agenda 2030, which dictates how the entire world population should live their lives, and which ideologies they must accept. See also this article. There is also the fact that the Energy Returned on Energy Invested (EROEI) for solar and wind energy is too low to be viable in most locations and scenarios, and therefore to repurpose and rebuild the world energy and industrial system to de-carbonise the economy is a waste of vast amounts of fossils fuels (no wonder the sector seeks subsidies). Despite decades of government subsidies wind power provides less than 5% of the world’s energy, and solar just 1%. Another deception is in relation to electric cars, see also the article Electric Cars are Fake Environmentalism. Electric cars are still driven by electricity produced from fossil fuels and will most likely continue to be. The manufacture of potentially hundreds of millions of new electric cars and electric car batteries involves a continuation of widespread mining and processing of rare earth metals, such as lithium, rhodium and cobalt, which are a limited resource. The mining and processing of rare earth metals has been shown to be polluting to land, air, and water systems, such as rivers. Furthermore, there are even instances of electric cars going on fire and exploding, due to battery issues or short circuits, see these videos The Shocking Truth About EV Fires You Need to Know and How to Survive an Exploding Electric Car. Society has also experienced decades of economic trickery via debt money banking, as well as fake science or perverse ideology being taught in schools worldwide, etc. Europe and the western world has also been subject to decades of increasingly unvetted mass immigration, and masses of so-called asylum seekers being funded and planted into European countries from faraway countries where there is no war at all. What could possibly go wrong? See also this article describing the conflict Over Hundreds of ‘Unvetted Migrant’ Centres Being Planted Throughout Ireland and the UK. For more details on these hoaxes and deceptions see also the books available here on the Reality Distinguished From Illusion website. The boats of stones are built by ulteriors hidden from the public eye, and launched by unelected institutions such as the UN and the World Economic Forum. Then big-salaried national and international politicians (‘Yes’ men of the institutional moneyocracy) tell the public they must climb aboard the stone boats or drown. (Who can forget the Covid lockdown and vaccination mandates purported to save us all from impending death). Upon closer inspection, one can see that the underside of the boat is made of stone, however, hardly anyone wants to dive into the water and look underneath the boat, because everyone else is walking up the gangway, and a loudspeaker is blaring “Come aboard – get your free vaccination here, and we have great finance deals on new electric cars”. “Leaders who have fallen into ignorance and who mislead people by directing them to the path of destruction are in effect, boarding a stone boat, and so too are those whose who blindly follow them… those who mislead people go to hell… humanity must first give up false leaders who present boats of stone” – Ancient Vedic scripture (Srimad Bhagavatam Canto 6 Chapter 7 Text 14, translated from Sanskrit by Srila Prabhupada) While the mega-corporate elites enact material or political power plays that advance their economic domination and political power, much of the general populace becomes more confused, weakened, poverty stricken, controlled or frustrated by endless regulations or government policies. Yet, many are, understandably, reluctant to jump off the boat, or do not know how to swim, i.e. few people know how to live independently of the government and corporate ‘system’. Thus, almost everyone is dependent on the increasingly authoritarian and restrictive government ‘system’ that has been imposed upon them. I spoke with a local farmer recently who tells me he spends so much time doing nonsensical paperwork and spending money to meet ridiculous regulations that the profession is hardly worth his time anymore, and none of sons would consider taking on such a time- and labour-intensive profession. However, not all the people are fooled or manipulated by the manipulators. Those with a stronger consciousness see through the lies. Nothing significant occurs by chance in a corporate-controlled world. Without money, planning and organisation, none of the above events would be possible. It is a question of power. There are those who manipulate to advance a certain agenda or self interest, and those who allow themselves to be manipulated. This is most effective when the targeted people are not aware they are being manipulated. Voluntary cogs in the machine are easier to deal with than forced ones. Who were the key players or misleaders that promoted the climate crisis hoax? My books CO2 Climate Hoax – How Bankers Hijacked the Real Environment Movement and Transcending the Climate Change Deception Toward Real Sustainability delve into this topic, including the role of the private banking sector, President Obama, Al Gore, various institutions, and academics. Linked to this agenda are the deceptive UN Sustainable Development Goals. Also aligned with UN climate change agenda is the World Economic Forum ‘reset’ agenda that was officially launched in 2020. The WEF reset agenda has been sold as a solution to the fabricated problems of climate change and Covid-19. This is the Hegelian Dialectic tactic: fabricate a problem to be perceived, foster a public reaction, and then provide the solution. The solution is actually the implementation of original objectives that would have faced public resistance, but now the policy or agenda can be implemented publicly as the ‘solution’ to the ‘perceived problem’. Modern day governments subservient to mega-corporations and private mega-banks, rather than the people they are supposed to serve, have also become morally degraded. In modern times, the fabricated matrix of economy, government, banking and corporate power is a reflection of a dominator culture. The entire ‘mainstream reality’ is made up by the so-called elites who own or control the mega-corporate media, mega-banks, and the mega-corporate industry. Via government funded schooling, TV shows, and corporate control of mass media we have been indoctrinated into a type of corporate-communist-consumer culture. We are meant to become dependent on the system, via the work treadmill or social welfare, pay more taxes, and be shackled to debt, rather than become independently self-reliant in our communities and local regions. Self-reliant communities are a threat to the control culture of the socalled ‘powers that be’. Furthermore, we have been trained into accepting that certain aspects of our society are untouchable truths that should not be debated. Life is focused around the pursuit of illusions fed by bogus mantras, such as “we must reach net-zero by 2050”, or “becoming rich will bring you happiness”. The masses are compelled to enter the treadmill of the ‘rat race’ and wake, eat, work, sleep, repeat, die, without ever examining we are actually here on Earth, or what our true purpose in life actually is. Obedience to institutions and ideas, which are not at all what they seem, is ‘expected’. Being manipulated means that one is, unfortunately, part of the manipulation, having accepted that role within a contrived social construction without questioning it. A social construction that twists reality in order to twist you. When we try to change the current system for the better by forming adversarial political movements and seeking votes, however well-intentioned this may be, we are actually playing into a rigged game in which the money masters or so-called elites always win. This is because in current times the entire political democratic system itself is a sham, a sort of punch and judy show for the masses. Notwithstanding the various valid issues facing the populace, both the so-called left and so-called right of the political spectrum are also to a large extent manifestations of a divide and conquer strategy. When one follows the money one may see that both ‘sides’ are typically controlled, funded by, or beholden to, the same orthodoxy of money masters, private bankers, or financial elites that control the economy and the debt money system itself. In the U.S., this was exemplified when President Obama, a Democrat, administered over a massive bailout of private banks (read orchestrated muti-trillion transfer to private banks) in 2010; and then President Trump, a Republican, administered a multi-trillion bailout (wealth transfer to asset management corporation Blackrock) in 2020, under cover of a fake pandemic. In reality both are beholden to, not the voters, but to a private banking cabal. The books Demonic Economics and Transcending the Climate Change Deception also cover this topic. Furthermore, President Obama has been a champion of the Climate CO2 Hoax; and President Trump has been a champion and supporter of the Covid-19 vaccines, which have been injurious to many people. Injuries due to vaccination are documented in many articles including this article by Professor Michel Chossudovsky The Covid “Killer Vaccine”; and in my book No Worries No Virus. While politicians pay well scripted lip service to their respective voter bases with powerful scripted speeches and sound bites, the voters, understandably desperate for a hero, are led to believe if their party can just win the next election then everything will be change. Meanwhile, ‘behind the scenes’ ulteriors that have the actual political power implement their plans to shape society, regardless of which party gets elected. The elections are just window dressing, or a mirage of change. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article to your friends and colleagues.

Title: These 5 Stocks Grew More than Bitcoin Over the Last Year
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/stocks-that-grew-more-than-bitcoin-8716756
Time Published: 2024-09-27T15:44:00Z
Full Content:
While Bitcoin's 130% surge grabbed headlines this past year, a select group of stocks outpaced the cryptocurrency behemoth. AppLovin (APP), MakeMyTrip (MMYT), NVIDIA (NVDA), Powell Industries (POWL), and TG Therapeutics (TGTX) all rode waves of market demand to deliver eye-popping returns. These five companies found remarkable success in their sectors, from AI breakthroughs to fronting an industrial boom. Moreover, their stellar performance wasn't just a flash in the pan. Standing behind their stock price increases are robust fundamentals and impressive metrics like revenue growth and return on equity (ROE), which suggest these stocks could keep outshining Bitcoin, one of the most volatile assets. Below, we dig into how they did it. Over the past year, BTC has had one of its best years, more than doubling in price. This was driven by the start of trading for spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), market sentiment, and other major financial catalysts. In late October 2023, BTC pierced the $30,000 level in a rally spurred by anticipation of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approving the spot BTC ETFs. The approval of ETFs from BlackRock and Fidelity significantly increased the institutional demand for BTC, increasing demand for the cryptocurrency. By January 2024, BTC's price surged to $49,000. There was also anticipation for the upcoming BTC halving event. However, the cryptocurrency didn't climb all year. In late January 2024, BTC corrected, dipping 20% to a low of $38,500. This was only a pullback, and by mid-February 2024, the cryptocurrency had rallied past $50,000. The BTC spring halving was another major catalyst for the cryptocurrency, as halving events reduce BTC's supply by cutting mining rewards in half, usually leading to a spike in its price. By mid-March 2024, BTC reached an all-time high of $73,835, fueled by solid demand, particularly from ETFs. Despite this peak, BTC began consolidating, trading between $49,000 and $73,895. In the preceding 12 months, the price of Bitcoin rose approximately 151%. The gauges for the stocks selected below are as follows: Below, we discuss the criteria further, but let's get to our analysis first: Among the top performers, APP led the pack with an impressive one-year return of 227.6%, supported by robust revenue growth of 37.3%. NVDA was close on its heels, delivering a 180.7% price return, kickstarted by extraordinary revenue growth of 194.7%. This was primarily thanks to surging demand in AI and data center sectors. TGTX stood out with its remarkable revenue growth of 1,341.6%, though its one-year price return of 160.1% was comparatively modest. POWL Industries and MMYT had consistent performance, with one-year returns of 179.7% and 182.1%, respectively. POWL's growth was particularly noteworthy at 44.8%. Regarding profitability and valuation metrics, NVDA emerged as a leader with an impressive return on equity (ROE) of 123.77% and a strong price-to-sales (P/S) ratio, indicative of its market dominance. TGTX was also quite strong, with a high ROE of 87.8%, though its P/B ratio at 21.0 was more modest. AppLovin's ROE of 70.7% was solid, but its particularly high P/B of 52.2 suggests investors are placing a significant premium on its expected growth. POWL appears lower in risk as a stock, given its P/B of 5.9 and steady ROE of 34.2%. MakeMyTrip rounded out the group with an ROE of 22.2% and a relatively high P/S of 14.4, reflecting a balanced growth trajectory and investors' optimism about its future in the expanding Indian travel market. AppLovin Corporation specializes in mobile app development and marketing products. The company provides a platform where developers can review metrics on their growth, work to increase user engagement, and review their mobile app revenues. AppLovin has demonstrated strong growth, with its stock price increasing by 228% over the past year. Several factors have driven this performance: AppLovin's high P/B ratio suggests that investors are placing a premium on the company's assets, likely because of its strong growth prospects and market position in the mobile app industry. That said, the company is in the highly competitive mobile technology sector. Its suite of tools and strong AI capabilities have positioned it as a leader in helping developers monetize their apps, particularly game developers. Holders of APP shares should be aware of potential risks: Despite these potential drawbacks, AppLovin's recent performance and strategic position have made it a standout in app development, allowing it to outpace even the impressive gains seen in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin over the past year. MakeMyTrip is a major online travel company primarily serving the Indian market. Founded in 2000 and based in Gurgaon, India, the company offers the typically comprehensive range of travel-related services travelers expect from today's major platforms. MakeMyTrip has shown significant growth, with its stock price increasing by 182% over the past year. Several factors have driven this performance: MakeMyTrip is a dominant player in India's online travel space, benefiting from the country's large and growing middle class, increasing internet availability, and rising disposable incomes. The company's strong brand recognition and wide service offerings have helped it maintain a leading position in a competitive market. The company's high P/S and P/B ratios suggest that investors are optimistic about its future growth in the rapidly expanding Indian travel market. However, investors should consider the following risks: Despite these risks, MakeMyTrip's strong market position and the robust growth of India's travel sector have contributed to its impressive stock performance, NVDA is one of the dominant companies producing advanced computer graphics processors, chipsets, and multimedia software. Founded in 1993 and based in Santa Clara, California, the company plays a significant role in AI, autonomous technology, and high-performance computing, helping to shift the evolution of visual computing and AI. NVIDIA has achieved record-breaking quarters recently, which has been driven by several key factors: NVIDIA is dominant in the GPU market, particularly in AI and high-performance computing. The company's technology is driving advances in many industries, including autonomous vehicles, healthcare, and scientific research. However, investors should be aware of potential risks: Despite these risks, NVIDIA's strong market position and growing demand for AI and high-performance computing products have contributed to its exceptional stock performance, outpacing even the significant gains seen in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin over the past year. Powell Industries, Inc., based in Houston, Texas, develops, designs, and manufactures custom-engineered systems and products for the energy and industrial sectors. The company is known for providing engineered products for electrical power infrastructure. Powell Industries has seen significant growth driven by several factors: The company's focus on custom products for critical infrastructure has helped it maintain a competitive edge. However, investors should consider the following risks: Despite these risks, Powell Industries' strong performance in recent quarters and its strategic position in essential infrastructure markets have contributed to its impressive stock performance. TG Therapeutics, Inc., founded in 1993 and based in North Carolina, is a biopharmaceutical company that acquires, develops, and brings to market therapies for B-cell malignancies and autoimmune diseases. TG Therapeutics has had excellent growth, driven by several key factors: The company's focus on novel therapies for B-cell-mediated diseases positions it well in areas where critical medical needs are unmet. However, investors should be aware of the following risks: Despite these risks, TG Therapeutics' recent commercial success and strong pipeline have contributed to its impressive stock performance. In identifying the stocks that outperformed bitcoin in the past year, we used measures that would highlight companies with strong growth potential, financial health, and market performance. By focusing on the key indicators below, we pinpointed stocks that showed both impressive past performance and had the strength in fundamentals to continue their upward trajectory: Market Capitalization Greater Than $300 million (Small Cap and Higher) Companies with the market capitalization described above are established but still have significant potential for growth. Small-cap and mid-cap stocks often outperform larger companies because of their potential for rapid revenue growth while still being large enough to withstand some economic changes. This ensures that the stock is less prone to extreme volatility when compared with microcaps, which can be highly speculative. In addition, larger companies provide more liquidity, making buying and selling shares easier. TTM Revenue Growth More Than 25% Consistent high revenue growth is a crucial indicator of a company's ability to expand its market share, innovate, and meet consumer demand. Revenue growth of more than 25% yoy indicates that the company is rapidly increasing its earnings. Strong revenue growth often leads to growth in earnings and stock price increases. TTM ROE Greater Than 15% ROE measures a company's profitability relative to its equity. An ROE of over 15% is an excellent figure, showing that management effectively turns shareholder equity into profits. High ROE companies are typically well-managed, competitive, and able to reinvest earnings effectively. P/B of 5 and Above A high P/B typically signals that investors are willing to pay a premium for the company's assets because they believe it will continue to generate superior returns. While a lower P/B is considered more value-driven, a higher P/B reflects increased expectations for growth and market confidence in the company's future performance. In high-growth stocks, a P/B of 5 or more suggests the company is well regarded for its potential. 1-Year Performance of More Than 150% A one-year price appreciation of over 150% demonstrates strong momentum, indicating that the stock has significantly outperformed the broader market. High performance over a year is often driven by strong earnings, revenue growth, and positive investor sentiment, all of which are necessary when selecting stocks that could outpace BTC's gains. Investors should focus on strong and consistent revenue growth and profitability metrics such as return on assets and ROE to identify stocks that may outperform cryptocurrencies like BTC. You should also review valuation ratios that show market confidence in future growth, such as high P/E or P/B ratios. Targeting industries with disruptive potential, such as AI or green energy, and selecting stocks with strong momentum and positive analyst reports are also worthwhile when selecting high-growth investments. Indeed, investing in stocks that could outperform BTC carries several risks, such as above-average market volatility. Valuation risks can also arise when stocks with high P/Es or P/Bs become overvalued. Industry-specific risks, such as regulatory challenges in sectors like technology and biotech, may hinder growth. In addition, stocks are sensitive to economic shifts like changes in interest rates and inflation. Company-specific or idiosyncratic issues, such as poor management or legal challenges, increase risk, requiring investors to look carefully before investing and diversifying their portfolios once they do. To diversify an investment portfolio with stocks and cryptocurrencies, investors should pick their holdings based on risk tolerance. Most investors will want to hold much of their portfolios in stable blue-chip stocks and other safer assets, with only a small portion for volatile cryptocurrencies. Over the past year, APP, MMYT, NVDA, POWL, and TGTX have had exceptional growth, outpacing even the stellar 150% rally in bitcoin's prices. Key drivers for these companies include strong revenue growth, high ROE, and market momentum. NVDA, in particular, capitalized on AI demand, while TGTX succeeded with its Briumvi therapy. APP and MMYT leveraged strategic new products, and POWL benefited from industrial sector growth, positioning these stocks as strong performers with robust fundamentals across very different sectors of the economy.
