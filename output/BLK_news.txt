Lifestyle by Blaze Media The only 'opportunity economy' the veep represents is the one letting Big Finance keep gutting the middle class. Kamala Harris is not a comedian, but you could be forgiven for thinking otherwise. During the recent presidential debate, the tireless TikToker somehow managed to maintain a straight face while pledging to create an "opportunity economy" for the middle class. Yet, this promise rings hollow when both she and President Biden are deeply entangled with BlackRock, a firm notorious for crushing the very group she claims to uplift. BlackRock’s CEO, Larry Fink, openly praises the efficiency of totalitarian regimes; what does this say about where the firm’s loyalties lie? In short, BlackRock has used its vast financial influence to sway political decisions, control market outcomes, and prioritize profits over the interests of everyday people. It's the puppet master behind the scenes, shaping policies that favor the elite while leaving the middle class to foot the bill. Harris' cozy relationship with BlackRock exposes her "opportunity economy" as nothing more than a smokescreen for serving the powerful. The facts speak for themselves. Harris' two top economic advisers, Michael Pyle and Brian Deese, were key players at BlackRock. Both weredrafted last month, likely to help her craft policies in anticipation of a potential presidency. As for Joe Biden, since taking office, he has surrounded himself with former BlackRock executives, embedding the financial giant's influence at the highest levels of government. Take Michael Pyle, once BlackRock’s global chief investment strategist, who recently served as U.S. deputy national security adviser for international economics. In this critical role, Pyle directed the administration's international economic policy and acted as Biden’s key representative, or “sherpa,” at the G7 and G20 summits. His sway over global economic strategy was significant. Before this, Pyle helped shape domestic policy as Harris’ chief economic adviser during the administration's disastrous first year. His deep ties to BlackRock underscore the firm’s growing grip on the Biden administration's decision-making, further aligning government policy with Wall Street’s interests. Last week BlackRock announced that it was rehiring Pyle as deputy head of it's $3.2 trillion portfolio management group. And let’s not forget Adewale "Wally" Adeyemo, another key player in the Biden administration. Currently serving as deputy secretary of the treasury, the 43-year-old was once Larry Fink'sright-hand man at BlackRock. During his time at the investment giant, Adeyemo acted as a senior adviser and led the firm's public policy team, directly shaping BlackRock’s strategy in navigating government relations and regulatory frameworks. His current role places him in a powerful position to influence U.S. financial policy. Then there's Eric Van Nostrand, a former BlackRock executive now serving as a senior adviser under Biden on economic issues related to Russia and Ukraine,as reported by Bloomberg. Since Van Nostrand’s appointment, BlackRock’s interest and involvement in Ukraine have suspiciously intensified, with the firm advising on reconstruction efforts and channeling investment into critical sectors. BlackRock's history suggests this support is far from altruistic. The firm has a notorious track record of capitalizing on geopolitical crises for financial gain, rather than genuinely aiding nations in need. Much like itsexploitative role during the 2008 financial crisis, when BlackRock profited from the collapse it helped precipitate, the firm now stands to benefit from Ukraine’s instability. Its influence over Kyiv’s policies, including the deregulation of urban planning, paves the way for corporate interests to exploit a rather dire situation. It doesn’t stop at Ukraine. BlackRock isn’t just funding the destabilization of democracies abroad — it’s actively helping China, a regime that poses an existential threat to American interests. The Coalition for a Prosperous America has revealed how BlackRock funnels billions into Chinese companies, many linked to the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army. This raises alarming questions about national security and America’s economic sovereignty. BlackRock’s CEO, Larry Fink, openly praises the efficiency of totalitarian regimes; what does this say about where the firm’s loyalties lie? Certainly not with the average American family struggling to make ends meet. As if that weren't enough, BlackRock’s involvement in the U.S. military-industrial complex adds another layer to its nefarious influence. As highlighted by researchers at Corporate Accountability, an organization committed to exposing corporations that undermine democracy, BlackRock holds tens of billions in investments in major defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, and Boeing. By profiting directly from never-ending wars, BlackRock reaps enormous financial rewards while American taxpayers are left to foot the bill. Which brings us back to Kamala Harris. For all her posturing, the flip-flopper-in-chief is not here to challenge this system. She’s here to safeguard it. If elected, Harris' economic policies will be molded by the same firm responsible for widening income inequality and eroding democracy. The Wall Street Journal has shed light on how BlackRock has amassed entire residential neighborhoods, turning these homes into rental properties. This aggressive acquisition strategy fuels bidding wars and drives up home prices, directly disadvantaging the middle class. As Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a Yale professor, has pointed out, Kamala Harris’ ties to Wall Street are even more intimate than Biden’s. And when Wall Street speaks, it’s really BlackRock’s voice you’re hearing. Harris’ campaign promises to support the middle class appear to be nothing more than a boldfaced lie. But this is what she excels at: bending the truth. Make no mistake about it: BlackRock’s interests are diametrically opposed to those of the American people. A Harris presidency would mean more policies that enrich the few at the expense of the many. Kamala Harris isn’t the answer; on the contrary, she’s part of the problem. John Mac Ghlionn

“He can't [negotiate] because he's owned by the West, by Washington, by London, by BlackRock, by the military industrial complex, so they're not gonna let him do that,” he continued. “They are making money out of this war and getting everything they can out of Ukraine and out of the resources that Ukraine has. So he has no other possibility. He could have stopped it as soon as he became the president in 2019.” “I fled this war because I was against this war and my government – the regime, the Kiev Nazi regime – tried to kill me for fighting for peace,” he continued. “A lot of Ukrainians who fled this war, they fled it because… they just don't want to fight, but they want to continue this war so they have the pride of Ukraine winning, and that is it. They don't understand the consequences. The consequences are a World War III situation. Ukraine cannot win this, and Ukraine already has lost when the war started, day one.”

Title: Former Merkel rival aims to become chancellor
URL: https://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/2871017/former-merkel-rival-aims-to-become-chancellor
Time Published: 2024-09-23T21:00:00Z
Full Content:
Squeezed out of top-level politics by his arch-party rival Angela Merkel more than two decades ago, Friedrich Merz is on course to land his first-ever government job as Germany's next chancellor. The conservative Christian Democrat Party (CDU) and its Bavarian sister party, which together are topping nationwide polls, last Tuesday agreed to nominate Mr Merz, 68, as candidate for chancellor in next year's federal election. A wealthy corporate lawyer who took a long hiatus from politics after losing a power struggle within the CDU to Ms Merkel in 2002, Mr Merz is widely considered a polar opposite in both style and policy to the woman who led Germany for 16 years. Where Ms Merkel was a consensus-driven, even-tempered pragmatist who shifted the CDU more towards the centre, Mr Merz is a brash and provocative economic liberal who advocates for a revival of Christian values and has pulled it back to the right since being elected CDU chief almost three years ago. He has been heard railing in recent months against Berlin's handling of migration -- marked by Ms Merkel's own open-door policy -- calling instead for asylum seekers to be turned away at German land borders. A Catholic father-of-three, married to a judge, Mr Merz hopes to win back voters from the anti-migrant Alternative for Germany (AfD), which this month became the first far-right party to win a state election since World War II. In the process, though, he has made a series of populist statements -- such as accusing some Ukrainian refugees of "social welfare tourism" and the children of some Muslim immigrants of being "small pashas" with no respect for authority -- that CDU insiders fear could alienate more centrist voters. The conservative premier of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous state, Hendrik Wuest, once considered a rival for the chancellor candidacy, earlier this year warned in a newspaper column the CDU should stick to Ms Merkel's "policies of modernity" rather than "scoring cheap points". In what his critics call a sign of his thin skin, Mr Merz, who towers over his opponents at nearly 2 metres tall, made an unusual public dig at Mr Wuest in response. "He is sensitive and quickly vexed, especially when he feels unjustly treated," said Jutta Falke-Ischinger, co-author of an unofficial biography on Mr Merz titled The Unyielding One. "He doesn't have much impulse control." However, Falke-Ischinger said Mr Merz was more decisive than current Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who is accused of dithering by his opponents. "He [Mr Merz] has an open ear for everything and everyone, is reliable; once he says something, he does it," she said. Mr Merz, a protégé of the late CDU grandee Wolfgang Schaeuble, clinched the job as party chief by dint of persistence and by appealing to grass-roots members frustrated with what they viewed as Ms Merkel's sellout of its core principles, said Alexander Clarkson, a lecturer for German studies at King's College London. "But he does not have much deep support in the party and is one blunder away from coming under enormous internal pressure," he said. The conservatives, which scored their worst-ever result in the 2021 election, have since risen in polls to about 33%, although analysts say that is relatively modest given the unpopularity of Mr Scholz's fractious coalition. Mr Merz, like Mr Scholz, has long languished in politician popularity rankings although his star has risen slightly of late. "He lacks popularity, but maybe you don't need that in these times, but rather you need to show strength -- which he does," said a high-ranking CDU politician, speaking on condition of anonymity. Mr Merz, who grew up in a small western town as the eldest son of a judge, was pushed out of his role as CDU parliamentary leader by Ms Merkel in 2002 and left the Bundestag in 2009 in order to pursue a successful business career. The amateur pilot, who disclosed in 2018 that he was earning about €1 million (36.7 million baht) a year, has worked on the advisory and supervisory boards of several major companies, from Commerzbank to BASF. He was also chairman of the German arm of BlackRock, the world's biggest fund manager. Critics accuse him of being out of touch with ordinary Germans and prone to representing the interests of corporate elites over the people. His decision to fly a private plane to the wedding of Finance Minister Christian Lindner in 2022 in a country wary of ostentation sparked controversy. Supporters say his private sector experience can help him better understand how to reboot a stagnant economy. Mr Merz, the author of the 2008 book Dare More Capitalism, has said he wants to reduce social benefits and taxes, particularly on companies. He also wants to simplify Germany's notoriously complex tax system; annual tax returns should be so simple you could write them on a beer mat, he once said. The government should create more competitive conditions for all firms for example by lowering energy prices and foster innovation rather than certain sectors like e-mobility, according to Mr Merz, who long opposed Germany's exit from nuclear power. Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING Research, said the main problem with the proposals was that Mr Merz had not spelt out how he would finance them. "Merz's economic policy proposals all make sense but are typical opposition proposals and not yet constructive ideas for a next government," he said. Mr Merz's fiscal conservatism, in particular his opposition to common European debt, could also put the brakes on ideas to boost EU growth, for example through higher public investment. Still, Mr Merz, who started his political career as a European lawmaker, has described himself as a "a truly convinced European" and advocated for a closer union, in particular on defence and foreign policy. This and his more hawkish stance on both Russia and China arguably make him more aligned with French President Emmanuel Macron, whom he visited in Paris late last year, than Mr Scholz is, according to Eurasia Group. British World War II leader Winston Churchill is the politician who has marked him most, he says, other than Schaueble. Mr Merz has also described himself as "a convinced transatlanticist", chairing the "Atlantic Bridge", a non-profit fostering US-German ties, for 10 years. His ability to put into place any of his ideas will depend in part on his ability to form a coalition with the very three ruling parties he has now spent years attacking, given he -- like all leaders of mainstream parties -- has ruled out working with the AfD. "As chancellor, he might cater to that growing desire for politicians with clear convictions after the Merkel and Scholz years," said Carsten Nickel at political risk consultancy Teneo. "But German politics is all about compromise in the end, and that might be something that comes less naturally to Merz." Reuters Sarah Marsh is chief correspondent for political coverage for Reuters in Berlin.

Title: Southwest Airlines Faces a Decisive Fight Over Its Future
URL: https://www.texasmonthly.com/news-politics/southwest-airlines-elliott-investor-day/
Time Published: 2024-09-23T19:26:52Z
Full Content:
Southwest Airlines will host a blockbuster event in Dallas this week, to unveil a service most other carriers began offering decades ago. At its annual Investor Day, Southwest will showcase its first-ever plan for assigning passengers to specific airplane seats, including premium-priced larger ones that will require altering the layouts of the company’s previously egalitarian cabins. Selling a variety of seating options at different price points has long been the practice at Fort Worth–based American Airlines—and at Delta, and United, and most other major carriers around the world. Yet some insiders think Southwest will treat the announcement with the sort of fanfare that accompanied Apple’s introduction of the first iPhone—framing it as a this-changes-everything moment for the company. Even if Southwest CEO Bob Jordan doesn’t don Steve Jobs’s trademark black mock turtleneck, the event will mark a pivotal point in the airline’s 53-year history. That’s because among the shareholders watching carefully will be those at Elliott Investment Management, a so-called activist investment firm led by New York City billionaire Paul Singer. If Elliott doesn’t agree that Thursday’s announcements will deliver a quick enough boost to Southwest’s stock price, it will likely turn up the volume of its calls for heads to roll at the airline—including Jordan’s. That Elliott is in a position to force anyone out of Southwest’s C-suite confirms that things have already changed dramatically at the company. Particularly under its famed cofounder and CEO, the late Herb Kelleher, the airline has fiercely defended its independence, including its maverick business practices, such as open seating. But as the airline has struggled in recent years—not least with hugely disruptive delays and cancellations caused by decades of underinvestment in digital technology—Elliott has gained considerable influence over its future. On June 10, Elliott announced it had acquired a big stake in Southwest, and it now says it holds 11 percent of the airline’s 599 million outstanding shares—enough to call for a special meeting at which it could, with the backing of a majority of other shareholders, force out some or all of Southwest’s board members and, by extension, Jordan. Elliott, which declined to make an executive available to Texas Monthly for an interview, has yet to call for such a meeting. Southwest, whose executives also declined our interview requests, tried to fend off Elliott’s attack earlier this month by offering to have six of its board members resign and to shrink its board from fifteen directors to twelve by next year. During a meeting at Elliott’s offices in New York City, Gary Kelly, Southwest’s executive board chairman and former longtime CEO, also said he’d retire by May. Elliott trumpeted that appeasement offer as unprecedented. But two days after receiving it, the firm’s representatives made clear to leaders of the union that represents the airline’s mechanics that it wasn’t enough. In a subsequent memo to union members, Bret Oestreich, president of the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association, wrote that Elliott wants Kelly out before next spring. Elliot’s “vision of a Southwest turnaround is one where Robert Jordan does not remain as CEO,” Oestreich added. “If Elliott can assert enough Board influence, other top executives would also, most likely, be replaced.” Jordan has indicated he’s not ready to step down, nor is he inclined to dismiss other executives. Back in August, he wrote to employees that the standoff with Elliott was “a battle for the heart of our company and our future—your future.” The word “heart” was no doubt carefully chosen by a company that once dubbed itself “the love airline,” is headquartered at Love Field, chose LUV for its stock ticker symbol, and paints a giant heart on the belly of each of its planes. On Thursday, Jordan will have the chance to woo Southwest’s other shareholders, the vast majority of which are institutional investors, such as the Vanguard Group and BlackRock. Such investors tend to demonstrate more patience than do “activist” funds such as Elliott, which typically press for actions that would quickly boost the stock price and are often skeptical of executives who wish to make longer-term investments in their businesses. Indeed, one analyst, Sheila Kahyaoglu, a managing director at New York investment bank Jefferies, has said she expects that most Southwest shareholders are unlikely to vote Jordan out without first “entertaining a go-forward plan.” Jordan will have the chance this week to make his case. At Investor Day, he may tout the multiple ways in which he has expensively upgraded the technology Southwest uses to position its planes and flight crews where they’re needed around the country. He could cite his securing of multiple new contracts with all of Southwest’s unionized workers and, now, the addition of premium-seating fees and red-eye flights. Could he add a Steve Jobs–style “one more thing”? Might Southwest end its “bags fly free” policy, since Elliott has called bag fees one of the “key commercial innovations” that Southwest has “written off”? Investors and analysts are eager to find out. Whatever’s in the works, for an airline that has cultivated an irreverent, fun-loving brand reputation, the stakes are seriously high. What would it mean to run Southwest Airlines to Elliott’s liking? The firm offers a snapshot of its vision through a website it created called Stronger Southwest. Solutions include replacing a slew of executives and board directors with outsiders who would turn Southwest into an airline more like American, Delta, and United—with the same checked-bag fees and even more basic economy and premium seating options than Jordan may propose on Thursday. In materials posted to the Stronger Southwest site, Elliott lists multiple executives it might seek to replace. They include Kelly, who has worked for Southwest for 38 years, and Jordan, whose tenure is 36 years, as well as chief financial officer Tammy Romo (33 years) and chief administrative officer Linda Rutherford (32 years). Each of them represents a direct link to airline cofounder Kelleher and former company president Colleen Barrett, who together built Southwest from a tiny Texas-only operation that started flying in 1971 into an airline that today carries more passengers domestically than any other in the U.S. and whose market value was, as recently as 2008, greater than those of the six other major U.S. airlines combined. In past conversations I’ve had with Jordan, Kelly, Romo, Rutherford, and Kelleher (who died in 2019), the long tenure of Southwest’s leadership was considered a strength at the company—cited as key to Southwest’s famously familial corporate culture. Cheryl Hughey, the airline’s senior adviser for culture and engagement, who began working at Southwest in 1980 as a reservation agent, once told me, “It is very important to know your heritage and how the foundation [of the company] was formed. That’s what families do.” Elliot’s Stronger Southwest site doesn’t mention family or corporate culture. But it does quote Kelleher: “If you don’t change, you die. . . . If things change faster outside your company than they change inside your company, you’ve got something to worry about.” That quote, taken from a 2014 conversation between Gary Kelly and Kelleher that’s discussed on Kelly’s own LinkedIn page, must read like nails on a chalkboard to Southwest’s traditionalist insiders. Elliott’s Stronger Southwest site makes no mention of Kelleher’s pronouncements that the airline primarily exists to serve its employees—not its shareholders. Kelleher’s mantra was that if the company takes care of its people, the people will take care of the customers, whose loyal patronage will benefit the shareholders. Elliott might argue, though, that Southwest isn’t caring for its people as well as it once did. Materials on the Stronger Southwest site note a “massive decline in annual profit sharing pay for employees” in recent years. Southwest’s annual profits were 57 percent lower in 2023 than in 2019, even as revenue was 16 percent higher. As a result, the average Southwest employee has seen annual profit sharing decline by more than $9,600 since 2019, according to Elliott. Critics have labeled Elliott a “vulture fund” because of its history of buying distressed bonds of countries on the brink of going broke. Its founder, Singer, famously waged a fourteen-year-long global legal battle to collect on debts owed by the nation of Argentina. The battle nearly erupted in violence when Elliott obtained a court order to seize a three-hundred-foot Argentine naval ship while it was moored off the West African nation of Ghana. Crew members drew their weapons on a man who attempted to board the ship. Calmer heads prevailed, but in the end, Argentina ponied up $2.4 billion to Elliott. The New Yorker reported that that amount represented a 1,270 percent return on Elliott’s initial investment. Elliott isn’t expecting quite so eye-popping a return on its Southwest investment. If the airline is managed as Elliott would prefer, according to Stronger Southwest, its share price should reach $49, although Elliott doesn’t say how quickly that could happen. Such an increase would yield more than $1.2 billion for the firm. If Southwest hopes to keep its adversarial investor from forcing it to become more like American and Delta and United—which, by the way, haven’t exactly delighted investors over the past decade—it might look to its past for guidance. Kelleher once told me, during a conversation in his windowless office at Southwest’s old Love Field headquarters, that he spent years parrying with Wall Street. “I would go to New York in the early eighties,” he said, “and the investment community would tell me that they thought Southwest Airlines was going to have a very short future unless we changed to emulate what the airlines had traditionally done.” Kelleher resisted such calls, and as Southwest continued growing and posted rising profits, eventually Wall Street relented. But that only came after a few tense encounters, including one with an investment banker that I first read about in Thomas Petzinger Jr.’s 1996 book, Hard Landing. During an interview with Kelleher two decades ago, I asked him to confirm that confrontation, which had occurred in the same office where we were sitting. Kelleher, who loved to put on a show, was more than happy to reenact what occurred. He set a Merit Ultra cigarette down in an ashtray and leaped from his blue leather chair, telling me that the banker said Southwest seemed like the perfect target for a hostile takeover. Kelleher wasn’t about to let Southwest get gobbled up by some bigger competitor—be it crosstown rival American Airlines or someone else. In recounting the story, he walked over, put his hands on my shoulders, and showed me how he’d slowly lifted the investment banker out of his seat. At over six feet, Kelleher, a former high school basketball star, could be physically imposing, and his baritone voice could sound downright scary when he got serious, which he had been with the banker. As he backed the man up against a wall and poked him in the chest, “the guy turned white as a sheet,” Kelleher told me. Kelleher explained to the banker that if any company tried to take over Southwest, he would do anything necessary to stop it. “I will even burn this company to the ground if I have to,” he said. The shocked banker ran out the door, passing through the adjoining office of Colleen Barrett (who died earlier this year). Barrett rushed in to ask Kelleher what had happened. He replied: “I just delivered a message to Wall Street.” Up until the COVID-19 pandemic, Wall Street heeded that message. Southwest still boasts a strong claim to being what it calls “the most successful commercial carrier in the history of aviation.” After its founding, the airline posted 47 consecutive years of profits, running from 1973 until COVID wrecked the travel industry, in 2020. Unlike American or Delta or United or most major U.S. carriers, Southwest has never declared bankruptcy. Postpandemic, Southwest, like other airlines, has faced serious operational headwinds. Some of its problems have been worse than those of its peers, such as its holiday season meltdown in 2022. Southwest has remained profitable, but its stock is down about 1 percent since May 2023, while United’s and Delta’s are up about 17 percent and 39 percent, respectively. (American is down 21 percent.) Elliott thinks Southwest can deliver shareholders a big short-term gain by becoming more like its rivals, the very thing Kelleher fought off all those decades ago. At Investor Day, we stand to find out whether the airline will comply or whether it’s about to deliver another defiant message to Wall Street.

Title: Feminism, Debt and Organizing Against Argentina’s Far Right
URL: https://inthesetimes.com/article/feminism-debt-argentina-far-right-milei-organizing
Time Published: 2024-09-23T18:27:00Z
Full Content:
BUENOS AIRES — As part of the Ni Una Menos (Not One Less) Collective in Argentina, we have been organizing feminist strikes and actions against the far Right’s austerity plan and its attacks on the rights of women and LGBTQI+ communities. We hope to offer an analysis from a feminist perspective that our movements can apply in the fight against debt under the new, far-right administration of President Javier Milei. Milei assumed office in late 2023 promising deregulation and ​“chainsaw cuts” and quickly began ushering in a slew of austerity measures that have targeted a spectrum of public services, including universities. He also closed Argentina’s anti-discrimination agency and the ministry that handles women’s affairs. We have been developing strategies for collective organizing against debt and the financial colonization of everyday life. This analysis is somewhat novel in Argentina, and we find it fundamental to understanding this moment of Milei’s ascendance. For the first time in our history, the Argentine state spends more on debt payments than pension payments. Under Milei, household debt has also intensified alongside the deregulation of prices for basic goods and services. In researching our book, A Feminist Reading of Debt, we found a large number of women were in debt from purchasing those types of goods and services needed for social reproduction (such as taking care of families and repairing homes, among many others) — a situation exacerbated by Argentina’s agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 2018. We call this ​“indebtedness to survive.” Alongside intellectuals like Silvia Federici, we think about the financial colonization of social reproduction as the invasion of finance into increasingly broader areas of life. That’s the context in which we approach the inherent antagonism of the term ​“financial caste.” We use the term in a very precise sense, which must be contrasted with how Milei and his libertarian political force have popularized the use of the word ​“caste.” They use this (and other terms) to present themselves as ​“outsiders,” signaling the political class as the cause of the problems that working people in Argentina face, which excludes the directors of major corporations and financial elites and institutions (banks, the IMF, investment fund managers, businessmen tied to digital finance) that benefit from crises in the Argentine economy. We refuse to let Milei hide his close ties with financial powers and corporations, which he obfuscates by redefining the language of his capitalist conservatism. We are forced to underscore the true meaning of ​“caste” for him and mark a concrete antagonism between the feminist struggle and those who try to profit from financial speculation at the expense of our bodies and spaces. We have outlined some of the lessons we have learned through our processes of resistance to the neoliberal shock policies applied by the extreme right — and we hope they can fuel others in their fights against far-right leaders devoted to corporations and the suppression of women and the working class. 1. For Milei, to govern is to destroy, create chaos and exercise cruelty The two novel characteristics of the neoliberal shockwave we are living through are its speed and violence. Milei derives his power from his links with hedge funds (like BlackRock) and powerful, extractivist corporations and the ultrawealthy (hence his frequent visits with Elon Musk). These deep ties are appearing as Argentine society is being reconfigured by new extremes of capitalism toward an extractive, warlike model. This system of governance is sustained through three vectors: the capacity for destruction (mass firings, elimination of entire state organs, destruction of social ties fostered by community groups); the creation of chaos (neoliberal shock politics and the imposition of new policies and norms, some of them unconstitutional); and the deployment of cruelty (withholding food from the poorest — and taking pride in it). None of it is about excesses or inadequacies but is a form of politics necessary to foster crisis and war. 2. We need to center decolonization There’s not much use arguing whether Milei is a symptom of the local impact of a global phenomenon, or an extreme national idiosyncrasy. So to better understand what is actually happening, we must consider what is new about Milei and to what degree his entrenchment in Argentine politics and society is not particular to national specificities and personal eccentricities. The impact of Milei’s far-right government, for example, exceeds former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro’s — because the crisis of the genocide in Gaza and the alignment of the United States and Israel have permitted Milei to approach the genocide on his own terms. But Milei too can be differentiated from the exponents of the far right of the Global North, like former U.S. President Donald Trump, because Milei does not operate with nationalism as the engine driving his regime. Instead, Milei’s project is neocolonial, from which he draws his power and effectiveness. As we have previously argued, neoliberalism in our region is inherently violent from its origins. The military dictatorship of 1976 — the moment at which the neoliberal model was applied — cannot be understood separate from the massive repression of popular uprisings. This authoritarianism is not an a posteriori deviation, and in that same way, the violence stemming from neoliberalism in Argentina is tied to processes of recolonization. We are now witnessing a new phase of that recolonization, which can be called ​“financial colonization” (including IMF austerity programs in various countries and the increasing presence of hedge funds targeting natural resources) and ​“military colonization” (as in the case of many Latin American countries, like Ecuador and Haiti, where the possibility of an internal war makes way for colonial domination). There is talk in Argentina of a form of national dissolution that would segment the country into sacrifice zones (with entire provinces linked to the activity of extractivist corporations), so centralizing the need for decolonization (by opposing vocabulary, terminology and practices) becomes a critical tactic. 3. Building power and redefining violence Feminists often think about the intersections of war to identify the emerging coordinates of violence. The war against the conditions of social reproduction (withholding food, liberalization of the prices of fundamental goods and services, freezing salaries) — as well as the war against the conditions for the reproduction of struggle (the economic crisis and debt that makes organizing and demonstrating nearly impossible) — is articulated with war as the global stage, meaning the far right can appeal to residents by polarizing localities that protest. Militarization is the highest stage of financial warfare, which is appearing in Ecuador, Haiti and Argentina (among others) in conditions somewhat similar to circumstances in Africa in the 1980s. Federici, using this perspective, highlights the necessity of generating a feminist antiwar movement to resist this militarization and financial warfare As militant activists and organizers ourselves, we have been obligated to rethink how we categorize and define violence. We have long been saying that violence fueled by toxic masculinity is incomprehensible without being embedded within a system of ​“economic violence,” which has transformed and intensified into ​“financial violence,” which (to invoke Étienne Balibar’s formulation) conforms to capitalism’s aim to become ​“absolute.” 4. Argentina is a laboratory for the rest of the world Milei’s far right is trying to channel a neoliberalism in crisis into relaunching a neo-extractivist project and agenda in the global market, particularly surrounding energy and lithium. One new development is that Milei’s government is not willing to make concessions in the face of increased social conflict. To affirm that Milei’s regime has fascist elements is not to say the majority of his voters are fascists. In fact, a great deal of his support can be explained through everyday economics. It’s a terrain that seems to be disregarded time and again in its inexorable materiality and, as such, in its political rationality. In the feminist movement, we have situated this link between fascism and everyday economics as a fundamental perspective to comprehend the economic violence endured by those who sustain the domestic economy, who go into debt just to survive while hearing from Milei that ​“there is no money” or ​“we’ll need to make sacrifices.” It presents our greatest challenge as anti-debt militants: How do we do politics when the language of austerity becomes the popular language? 5. The streets are a vital space The feminist marches that saw participation from hundreds of thousands of women in cities across Latin America on March 8 (International Women’s Day), including tens of thousands in Buenos Aires, were remarkable for several reasons. We used them against a far-right government that has publicly declared us to be the enemy, has defunded the right to abortion and has campaigned publicly with racist and misogynistic discourse. We organized in spite of the repressive protocol that criminalizes protest, which made self-care essential. And it was all in the midst of Milei’s government waging an economic war against the Argentine population, which makes organizing and mobilizing a huge undertaking. The greatest beneficiary of these neoliberal shock policies is the financial caste. The policies are enacted with the idea that feminized bodies, in ever more precarious conditions, will take on more work to sustain life. We will fight back through feminism of the people.

Title: AI Chip Maker Alphawave Sees Stock Tumble On Revenue Drop

Time Published: 2024-09-23T18:05:11Z
Full Content:
Alphawave Semi was valued at £3 billion ($4 billion) when it debuted on the London Stock Exchange in ... [+] May 2021. Photographer: Tiffany Hagler-Geard/Bloomberg Alphawave Semi surprised investors this morning when the semiconductor company released interim earnings results that sent its London-traded shares tumbling by as much as 43% before paring the losses to finish the day down by 14%. Alphawave’s leadership said on Monday that it had to cut its revenue forecast for 2024, but still expects to hit its targets from next year onward. The chip designer said it now expects to generate revenue of $310 to $330 million in 2024, down from the $345 to $365 million it had projected earlier. Alphawave blamed the change in its outlook on the merger of two large AI customers in Korea as well as the timing of tape-outs in the second half of the year. Tape-outs occur when Alphawave has completed its work and transfers the finalized design of a semiconductor device to chip foundries for fabrication. The Canadian company does not actually manufacture the chips. Instead, Alphawave focuses on developing the technology within semiconductors that allows them to transmit data more rapidly for use in artificial intelligence. “Another guidance cut isn't helpful but the important part for us, we believe, is the underlying business remains strong and visibility on 2025 is improving, aided by Alphawave being exposed to the best end market in semis–AI,” Barclays analyst Simon Coles said in a note to clients. Barclays maintained an overweight rating on Alphawave’s shares, but lowered its price target to 190 pence from 195. The company’s shares closed Monday at 107.8 pence. “Our OW [overweight] is predicated on the fact that Alphawave only needs to take a little market share to see material growth in the coming years given the growth expected in its end markets,” Coles added. Alphawave’s filing on Monday showed that its revenue had been halved in the first half of the year to $91 million. The company also reported an adjusted net loss before depreciation, interest and taxes of $11.8 million, after booking a profit of $32.4 million in the same period last year. “We expect revenue and adjusted Ebitda in the second half to increase significantly over the first half as our high-quality design wins from last year tape-out and convert into revenue,” John Lofton Holt, executive chairman of Alphawave, said in its filing. Alphawave first debuted on the London Stock Exchange in May 2021 with a listing price of 410 pence and the backing of blue-chip asset managers BlackRock and Janus Henderson. In late 2021, the Financial Times raised questions over whether it had properly disclosed related-party transactions. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

September 23, 2024 13:57 ET | Source: Force For Good Force For Good LONDON, Sept. 23, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Force For Good: The world is failing to meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and urgent action is needed to unlock progress and overcome the growing annual SDG funding gap, which now stands at US$14-17 trillion, a new report from Force for Good finds, US$112-136 trillion in total, up 10%, due to the costs of global climate transition and development needs in the Global South. Today, only 16% of the goal’s 169 underlying targets are on track to be met by 2030, with 50% falling behind, and 30% regressing below their 2015 levels when the SDGs were kicked off, the report finds. Nine ‘Big Ideas’, including climate transition frameworks, AI-enabled connectivity, and universal digital financial services, if scaled globally, have the cumulative potential to progress SDG achievement to nearly 90%, from less than 66% today, reigniting exponential progress. “This report shows how the global order and the systems itself can be transformed by delivering solutions en masse across the planet, engaging everyone in this endeavour ... By leveraging the strengths of governments, private companies, NGOS and mobilising the individual as an agent of change, we can create a sustainable, secure, and prosperous future,” said Ketan Patel, Chair of the Advisory Council. The world’s failure to meet the goals is being driven by a series of interrelated economic, political, geopolitical and environmental shocks - including the COVID-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine and Gaza, the energy, cost-of-living and climate crises – interacting with one another to create a ‘polycrisis’ that is diverting attention and resources away from sustainable development. A mass and fast roll out of the ‘Nine Big Ideas’, sponsored by appropriate champions across government, private sector or multi-lateral institutions, working with the United Nations, can make a transformative impact on developing countries, while benefitting the global economy. While the mass mobilisation of solutions will take a global effort, the largest developing countries, particularly India, China, and Brazil, account for two-thirds of the world’s sustainable development potential. These countries represent the first wave of opportunity in a multi-wave project to realize the future faster. Meeting the SDGs is a crucial step for the world in the transition to the next era of human civilization, building a platform on which further breakthroughs and technologies can create a sustainable, secure and superior future. About Force for Good Force for Good's mission is to mobilize capital, resources, and ideas as a force for good in the world at a time of profound change. The organization's Capital as a Force for Good Initiative engages the world's leading financial institutions and other stakeholders, to promote sustainable development through the deployment of capital and solutions to address global issues and enable the transition to a better future.

Title: Italy approves BlackRock holding more than 3% in Leonardo

ROME (Reuters) -Italy has approved BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), the world's biggest asset manager, holding a stake of more than 3% in Italian defence and aerospace group Leonardo, a document seen by Reuters showed on Monday. The document, sent by Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's office to parliament, deals with so-called "golden power" decisions. Rome has "golden powers" to block or set conditions on foreign and domestic investments, as well as governance changes, involving companies that operate in strategic sectors such as energy, telecoms, defence and banking. "I am happy for the interest of BlackRock. It is an important recognition," Leonardo chief executive Roberto Cingolani told Reuters. The cabinet granted the authorisation to BlackRock on Sept. 18 while also imposing some unspecified conditions, according to the document. Under Italian legislation, Meloni's office must approve share ownership in any strategic firm which is also listed on the Milan stock exchange when the stake crosses thresholds set at 3%, 5%, 10%, and various other intervals up to 50%. However, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters BlackRock was expected to trim its stake in a short time, as Leonardo's bylaws stipulate that no investor outside the public administration can own more than 3% of capital. Italy's economy ministry owns 30.2% of Leonardo, the country's leading defence group as well as a manufacturer of satellites and orbiting infrastructure. BlackRock is also a leading investor in Italy's financial sector, holding 7% of UniCredit and 5% of Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY), the country's top two banks.

The pension giant also committed another $1 billion to a BlackRock climate fund after dumping nearly $4 billion in public equities earlier this year. The New York State Common Retirement Fund cashed out of three multi-asset strategic partnerships worth more than $3 billion during July, according to its latest monthly transaction report. The $268 billion pension fund also committed $1 billion to a BlackRock climate change fund, marking the second straight month it invested in public equities after terminating a combined $3.8 billion worth of equity funds in March and April. The NYSCRF ended a Schroder Investment Management multi-asset fund within its multi-asset strategic partnership portfolio that was worth approximately $1.2 billion, which was allocated to cash. It also terminated multi-asset funds managed by Morgan Stanley Investment Management and Wellington Management, respectively, which were worth $1.1 billion each and were also allocated to cash. Within its public equities portfolio, the pension fund doubled its investment in BlackRock’s MSCI Climate Change Index to $2 billion. The commitment follows an initial $1 billion investment in January 2023. The fund tracks an index that measures opportunities and risks associated with the transition to a low-carbon economy. It was up 31% in 2023 and 15% annually over five years. Never miss a story — sign up for CIO newsletters to stay up-to-date on the latest institutional investment industry news.  The pension fund earmarked nearly $800 million within its real estate portfolio during July, $300 million of which is going to the BentallGreenOak Asia IV fund, a closed-end, pan-Asian fund managed by real estate investment firm BentallGreenOak. Another $200 million will be invested in Oaktree Capital Management’s Oaktree Real Estate Opportunities Fund IX, described as a broad-based opportunistic real estate fund. The NYSCRF also committed $150 million to the KKR Real Estate Partners Americas IV Co-Investment fund managed by KKR & Co. Inc. The fund co-invests with KKR Real Estate Partners Americas IV fund and is sponsored by KKR. In addition to the real-estate fund investments, the pension fund also bought a few properties during July. Its largest such acquisition was Building B at The Cubes at Glendale, an Arizona industrial park, for $128.1 million. The NYSCRF also paid slightly less than $1.6 million to buy a complex in Otsego, New York, that includes one building with 64 residential units and one commercial space. The pension fund paid slightly less than $1.1 million for a three-story building with eight residential units in Dutchess County, New York. Within its private equity portfolio, the NYSCRF committed $400 million to the Kohlberg Empire State Co-Investment Fund, managed by Kohlberg & Co. The fund will invest additional capital with the Kohlberg NY Investors X-B fund, mainly in the U.S. It is also investing $300 million to the Kohlberg NY Investors X-B fund, also managed by Kohlberg & Co. The fund will seek investments in pharmaceutical and medical products and services; infrastructure services; business services; financial and information services; health care services; and the food and consumer sectors. The pension fund also earmarked $250 million within its real assets portfolio to the Hull Street Energy Partners III fund, which mainly invests in power generation assets involved in energy transition. As part of the NYSCRF’s emerging manager program, which invests with newer, smaller and diverse investment management firms, the pension fund has set aside $15.7 million for the Valspring Capital Fund I within its private equity asset class. The fund aims to make growth equity investments in U.S.-based, tech-enabled health care and health care services companies.

This purchase is notable as it increases Saba Capital Management's holdings in the company to a total of 20,601,568 shares. The investment decision reflects Saba Capital's continued interest in the health sciences sector and its confidence in BlackRock Health Sciences Term Trust's performance. BlackRock Health Sciences Term Trust is known for its focus on the health sciences industry, which includes sectors like biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, and medical devices. The trust's investment strategy and portfolio composition make it an attractive option for investors looking to diversify into this segment of the market. As a prominent investment firm, Saba Capital Management's market activities are closely watched by investors and analysts alike. The firm's latest move could signal a positive outlook for BlackRock Health Sciences Term Trust, potentially influencing other investors' perceptions of the trust's value and prospects. The investment details were disclosed in a regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which provides transparency into the trading activities of the firm's executives and significant shareholders. These filings are a valuable resource for investors looking to understand the investment patterns and strategies of major players in the financial markets. For those interested in tracking the performance of BlackRock Health Sciences Term Trust, the stock trades under the ticker symbol NYSE:BMEZ. As always, investors are encouraged to consider the broader market context and perform their own due diligence before making investment decisions. As Saba Capital Management increases its stake in BlackRock Health Sciences Term Trust (BMEZ), investors are evaluating the trust's recent performance and financial metrics. According to InvestingPro data, BMEZ boasts a market capitalization of approximately $1.7 billion, with a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 25.31, reflecting the market's valuation of the company relative to its earnings. One of the standout InvestingPro Tips for BMEZ is its significant dividend yield, which currently stands at an impressive 13.19%, as of the last dividend with an ex-date of September 16, 2024. This yield is particularly attractive to income-focused investors who are looking for steady cash flows from their investments. In contrast, a point of concern may be the weak gross profit margins, which could indicate challenges in maintaining profitability relative to sales. Additionally, the valuation implies a poor free cash flow yield, suggesting that the price investors are willing to pay for each dollar of free cash flows is relatively high. Despite these concerns, BMEZ has been trading near its 52-week high, with the price being 96.26% of the peak, indicating strong investor confidence and a potentially bullish outlook among market participants. The trust has also experienced positive total returns across various time frames, with a year-to-date price total return of 17.71% and a one-year price total return of 24.4%. For those considering an investment in BMEZ, there are additional InvestingPro Tips available, offering deeper insights into the trust's financial health and market performance.

The HKMA has engaged 11 firms for advanced e-HKD+ digital currency trials, so far. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has announced the launch of the second phase of its central bank digital currency (CBDC) pilot program, known as e-HKD, according to a Sept. 23 statement. The second phase will delve into advanced use cases for digital money, emphasizing e-HKD and tokenized deposits for individuals and businesses. The first phase focused on testing CBDC applications in domestic retail payments, offline transactions, and the settlement of tokenized assets. The HKMA stated that the initiative has evolved from its original e-HKD focus and is now rebranded as Project e-HKD+ to align with the changing fintech landscape. The HKMA has engaged 11 firms from various sectors to investigate e-HKD applications in three main areas, including tokenized asset settlement, programmability, and offline payments. Some of the participants reportedly involved in phase 2 include ANZ, Airstar Bank, Aptos Labs, BlackRock, Bank of Communications (Hong Kong), ChinaAMC, China Mobile, DBS, Fidelity International, Kasikornbank, and Sanfield. The HKMA stated that these firms will evaluate the commercial viability of new digital money forms within real-world settings, aiming to enhance accessibility for individuals and corporations. The results of Phase 2 will provide insights into the practical challenges of creating a digital money ecosystem that integrates both publicly and privately issued digital currencies. Project e-HKD+ will further develop the necessary technology and legal framework to support potential future issuance of e-HKD for both individuals and businesses. To foster collaboration, the HKMA will establish the e-HKD Industry Forum. This platform will enable participating institutions to discuss common challenges and explore the scalable implementation of new digital money forms. Industry-led working groups will address specific topics, initially focusing on programmability. Similar to Phase 1, an e-HKD sandbox will be available for pilot participants to facilitate prototyping, development, and testing of use cases. During Phase 2, the HKMA will collaborate closely with the selected firms over the next 12 months to share key findings with the public by the end of next year. HKMA chief executive Eddie Yue stated: “Project e-HKD+ signifies the HKMA’s commitment to digital money innovation. The e-HKD Pilot Programme has provided a valuable opportunity for the HKMA to explore with the industry how new forms of digital money can add unique value to the general public. The HKMA will continue to adopt a use-case driven approach in its exploration of digital money.” Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: Northvolt to axe 1,600 jobs as Europe's EV hopes stall
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/northvolt-to-axe-1600-jobs-as-europes-ev-hopes-stall-3627890

By Marie Mannes STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Northvolt plans to cut 1,600 jobs at its base in Sweden, or about a fifth of its global workforce, as Europe's biggest hope in the electric vehicle battery market struggles with production problems, sluggish demand and competition from China. The leader in efforts to build a European automotive battery industry said on Monday it would suspend plans for a large expansion of its Northvolt Ett factory in Skelleftea, northern Sweden. In an effort to cut costs, Northvolt slimmed down its business earlier this month, departing from its original mission to be an all-in-one shop offering everything from material production and battery making to end-of-life recycling. With Volkswagen (ETR:VOWG_p) among its owners, Northvolt has led a wave of European startups investing billions of dollars in battery production to serve the continent's automakers as they switch from internal combustion engines to EVs. But the Swedish company has struggled with order delays. Problems scaling up production led BMW (ETR:BMWG) to pull a $2 billion order in June. Northvolt said on Monday it would focus on ramping up the first 16 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of annual battery cell production capacity at Northvolt Ett, while shelving a construction project that had aimed at increasing its capacity by another 30 GWh. Currently, the company produces less than 1 GWh and originally planned for the factory to ultimately make batteries for over one million cars a year, at 60 GWh of capacity. Growth in EV demand is also slower than some in the industry projected, and competition is stiff from China, which accounts for 85% of global battery cell production, International Energy Agency data shows. "We are determined to overcome the challenges we face, and to emerge stronger and leaner," Northvolt co-founder and CEO Peter Carlsson said in a statement. "We now need to focus all energy and investments into our core business." The company's R&D hub, Northvolt labs, will slow all programmes and expansion, while maintaining the fundamental platforms, it said. It did not mention the fate of planned gigafactories in Germany and Canada, which are at risk of being postponed. EUROPEAN PROSPERITY Northvolt's "level of ambition and their level of realism at the moment is fairly good in that they're not pushing blindly ahead when it's not working," said Evan Hartley, an analyst at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. Northvolt is still loss-making despite securing orders worth over $50 billion from customers including top investor Volkswagen, underscoring Europe's struggle to compete with the dominance of Chinese battery makers such as CATL and BYD (SZ:002594). The Swedish firm has organised $15 billion in equity and debt financing from a raft of players including Goldman Sachs - its second-biggest investor - and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), according to filings, and has been trying to raise more to fund its ramp-up. It lost $1.2 billion last year, up from a $285 million loss the year before. Its cash on hand at the end of 2023 was $2.13 billion. Former European Central Bank head Mario Draghi warned this month that Europe needed a far more coordinated industrial policy and massive investment to keep pace economically with the United States and China. But many European governments are financially stretched following the COVID pandemic and grappling with anaemic growth. Sweden's Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said on Sept. 13 that while he wanted companies engaged in green technologies to thrive, the government would not take a stake in Northvolt. The government has also said it will not lend to the company. Carlsson said all interested parties should work with the company. "I believe it's important going forward that all the stakeholders we work with now - customers, shareholders, lenders, and also national stakeholders - are contributing to a good long-term solution, because this is about European prosperity and competitiveness," he told Swedish radio.

Ethereum outflows contrast broader market rebound following dovish Fed stance. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Digital asset investment products saw inflows for the second consecutive week this month, with investors pouring $321 million into the industry, according to CoinShares‘ latest weekly report. This influx boosted the total assets under management (AuM) for crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) by 9%, bringing the total to $85.8 billion. The overall investment product volume also increased to approximately $9.5 billion. James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, linked this positive trend to the Federal Reserve’s recent decision to cut interest rates by 50 basis points. He explained: “This surge was likely driven by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) comments last Wednesday, which took a more dovish stance than anticipated, including a 50 basis point interest rate cut.” A breakdown of the flows showed that Bitcoin-based investment products led the inflows, generating $284 million in net gains globally last week. Notably, major crypto funds from firms like BlackRock, Bitwise, Fidelity, ProShares, and 21Shares contributed to this rebound, collectively adding $321 million in net inflows. The positive price momentum for Bitcoin also attracted investors with bearish sentiment, who allocated $5.1 million to short-Bitcoin funds. Ethereum faced its fifth consecutive week of outflows, totaling $29 million. This trend stems from ongoing withdrawals from Grayscale’s ETHE product and declining interest in new offerings. According to Farside data, ETHE experienced outflows between $13 million and $18 million for three straight days last week, overshadowing minor inflows from other products, including Grayscale’s Mini-Trust. Meanwhile, Solana maintained its current positive trend, adding $3.2 million in inflows last week. This flow can also be linked to the announcements of several traditional financial institutions announcing plans to launch financial services on the network during the latest Solana Breakpoint event in Singapore. Other large-cap altcoins, including XRP and Litecoin, saw combined inflows of $300,000. Across regions, the US unsurprisingly emerged as the leading contributor to last week’s inflow, accounting for $277 million, followed by Switzerland with $63 million. In contrast, Germany, Sweden, and Canada experienced outflows of $9.5 million, $7.8 million, and $2.3 million, respectively. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: Fractional Consultancy Launches to Accelerate Sustainability Efforts

ADWEEK House is your house during advertising's big week in NYC. Join us for content, to take a beat, recharge and make industry connections. RSVP to join us October 8-9 in New York City. Plenty of agencies claim some form of sustainability offerings for clients, but few make it their main focus. As Climate Week NYC gathers global leaders to find ways to tackle climate change, Chiefly & Co., a women-led fractional executive consultancy, is launching to help companies prove that being sustainable is not just the right thing to do, but it’s also good for the bottom line. Chiefly & Co. has created a unique model that combines fractional domain expertise with a commitment to sustainable practices. The consultancy looks to become a go-to partner for companies and organizations that have a desire to accelerate their sustainability efforts while still driving for business success. Founder Melanie Mercier, after stints at BlackRock, Gap, and as a consultant and experiential marketer, decided to get her executive MBA at Tulane University a few years ago. There, she read case studies about organizations like Unilever, which transformed its business through sustainability efforts that led to profitability and success. She also realized the negative impact the experiential and events industry had on the planet and wanted to do something about it. “Sustainability is a business imperative, and it’s not just in one sector, it’s across all business sectors, Mercier told ADWEEK. Mercier cited studies by Morgan Stanley, Accenture, and others showing that sustainability is the new key driver to innovation, value creation, and cost savings and profitability. “There is a misconception out there that sustainability and profitability don’t coexist, when actually they do and they should. We’re helping to shed light on that and bring that to the forefront of businesses,” she added. Debuting during Climate Week NYC—where Mercier will be on hand with a few of the fractional executives on her roster—underscores Chiefly & Co’s commitment to helping businesses take meaningful action on sustainability. The consultancy’s approach leverages the power of top-tier fractional leaders and provides companies with expert guidance to navigate sustainability issues and profits, especially since many companies don’t have that type of leadership and domain expertise internally. Chiefly & Co’s C-suite leaders will ensure success for clients by looking across the organization to break down silos, build consensus, and embed sustainability throughout organization. “No matter where sustainability originates, whether it’s through the marketing function or just coming from the CEO as a mandate, we make sure it is embedded into the fabric of the organization,” said Mercier. Every organization gets tailored strategies from Chiefly & Co. based on the needs and budget, but the company works from frameworks that are aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It also will follow all compliance and reporting guidelines. “It’s really looking at how organizations can innovate, create value, and build strategies, but making sure they’re aligned with the SDGs so companies are on target to hit net zero by 2050, if not sooner, and lowering carbon emissions,” said Mercier. “We’re positioning Chiefly & Co, and our fractional experts, as the planet profit pros.” Taking a fractional executive approach is another step towards sustainability, as the client can scale up or down based on needs. Fractional talent and agencies are a growing trend in the marketing world. While one might call it freelance work, being a fractional C-suite member offers former agency and business executives the freedom to work on high-level projects without being tied to one client or agency. “Fractional is the new modern, sustainable leadership solution and that is the benefit that we bring to businesses,” said Mercier. Mercier continued that some companies may need expertise in a particular area, but they don’t have it internally, so Chiefly & Co. can fill that gap with a fractional executive. Those people have been in executive roles before, so they can easily embed themselves and contribute value, helping organizations meet both commercial and sustainability goals, she explained. “We’re bringing domain expertise and industry expertise into that business, so we would very carefully match a fractional executive with an organization to make sure it’s a good fit and we can deliver on those goals,” Mercier said. Mercier built her team through connections she has culled throughout her career. As she moved into fractional work as a COO, she met other like-minded women—currently, all Chiefly & Co. talent are women—and decided she could create something that brought sustainability to the forefront. She has a collection of CEOs, CSOs, CMOs, talent officers, CXOs and CTOs who have worked for companies including Deloitte, Gap, Microsoft, and JPMorgan Chase to scale for brands seeking top-level fractional talent.

Experts believe that the approval would pave the way for more diverse funds providing exposure to Bitcoin. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved Nasdaq to list and trade options on BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) product, iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). Options trading enables investors to buy or sell assets at a pre-determined price, helping them speculate on price movements. So, this decision marks another step toward broadening the range of Bitcoin-linked derivatives, offering investors more tools to manage exposure to the flagship crypto asset. However, the product still requires the approval of the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted that other major firms might soon receive approval for their own Bitcoin ETF options. He said: “Huge win for the the bitcoin ETFs (as it will attract more liquidity which will in turn attract more big fish).” Nate Geraci, President of ETF Store, suggested that approving options for spot Bitcoin ETFs could lead to the development of more Bitcoin ETF-based products. Geraci stated: “Expect a flurry of various ETF filings like Bitcoin buffer or defined outcome ETFs, Bitcoin premium income or yield max (covered call) ETFs, Bitcoin tail risk ETFs, Bitcoin convexity ETFs.” Jeff Park, head of alpha strategies and portfolio manager at asset management firm Bitwise, pointed out that Bitcoin options will likely generate strong institutional demand, setting the stage for a gamma squeeze. A gamma squeeze occurs when stock prices rise rapidly because market makers buy more stock to cover their options positions, driven by high demand for call options. In Bitcoin’s case, Park explained that the Bitcoin ETF options market introduces regulated leverage on a supply-constrained asset. He added: “With Bitcoin options, investors can now make duration-based portfolio allocation bets, especially for long-term horizons. There’s a good chance that owning long-dated OTM calls as premium spend will give investors more bang for their buck than a fully-collateralized position that could drop by 80% over the same period.” Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: Atlanticism or Sovereignty? Fight in Germany Continues With Latest State Election
URL: https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2024/09/atlanticism-or-sovereignty-fight-in-germany-continues-with-latest-state-election.html
Time Published: 2024-09-23T10:00:28Z
Full Content:
Last week the European Parliament passed a resolution that calls for Western countries to strike inside Russia with long range missiles, the confiscation of Russian assets, and ever tougher sanctions against Moscow. It received the support from 425 MEPs — a slight decrease from the parliament’s first document adopted after the June elections, which called for Ukraine support for as long as it takes was supported by 495 MEPs out of 720. In Germany, the sputtering engine of the EU, voters are making it increasingly difficult to keep up with the chutzpah of the European Parliament. The biggest Russia war cheerleaders like Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock aren’t quite as vocal as they used to be following the beating voters delivered to them in June’s European elections and recent state votes. Yesterday’s state election in Brandenburg, which encircles Berlin, provided a temporary respite for Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s beleaguered Social Democratic Party (SPD), which came in first with 30.7 percent. The sovereignist, enthno-nationalist Alternative for Germany placed second with 29.5 percent. The Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW), another sovereignist party that focuses on antiwar and working class issues, came in third at 13.5 percent. The SPD’s first-place finish isn’t as impressive as it would seem. The party, which has ruled Brandenburg since German reunification, saw its support decline from 31.9 percent in the last election in 2019, and the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) was likely sacrificed in order to get it there. The CDU plummeted from 23 in 2019 to 12 percent with many voters throwing their support behind the SPD. Crucially, the Greens fell below the five percent threshold, which means they will not be have any seats in the state parliament. That rule in Germany, intended to prevent gridlock, now looks more likely to help produce it. The initial results mean that the SPD will have to form a coalition with either the AfD or BSW. Regardless, the AfD will have 30 out of 88 seats, which due to the “firewall” pact among parties not to work with the AfD, means it will have the ability to block decisions and elections that require a two-thirds majority, such as the election of constitutional judges. There is just one more state election on the calendar (a March vote in Hamburg, an SPD stronghold) before next fall’s national elections. While all three September state elections (Brandenburg, Saxony, and Thuringia) took place on fertile ground for the AfD and BSW, the results are still striking in a Germany known for its cherished stability. The results in Brandenburg mean that the AfD took home two silvers and one gold.The BSW, essentially a one-woman party that formed only nine months ago, came in third in all three races. The two insurgent parties took everything the establishment could throw at them, and voters still made them serious challengers in the political battle over Germany’s future that is just beginning. US Colony or Sovereign State? In an effort to halt the rise of the AfD and BSW, all of the major centrist parties are now supporting much stricter immigration control. One can see why as immigration has consistently topped voters’ list of concerns — unsurprisingly when the record levels of immigrants coincides with a retracting economy, a housing crisis, and social spending cuts. Despite the endless warnings against the dangers of the AfD’s anti-immigrant positions, all of the center parties were quick to throw the immigrant welcome mat overboard when the AfD and BSW started attracting more voters. They have not been willing to touch the broader issue of vassalage to the US and a self-defeating Russia policy, however. They might be forced to. It is going to be impossible for the center parties to govern in the three eastern states without Wagenknecht’s party (or without giving up on the AfD firewall). And what does Wagenknecht want in return? She’s looking for the CDU to make concessions on support for Project Ukraine and even more importantly when looking to the future, the stationing of US long range missiles in Germany. And it’s possible that similar coalition math could be in play after next year’s national elections if the AfD and BSW can continue to peel away voters from the Atlanticist center. Here’s the current state of polling: As of now, this would mean only 5 parties in the Bundestag, and the CDU would be forced to side with its fellow Atlanticists, the SPD and the hated Greens, or forget the firewall and team up with the AfD. But a year is a long time. The major problem for the three parties of the ruling traffic light coalition (SPD, Greens and Free Democratic Party) is that all signs point to the economy continuing to tank and their support will likely continue sink along with it. Border controls to keep out immigrants won’t do anything to keep industry in. Companies that rely on cheap and reliable energy continue to leave the country due to Germany’s Russia policy. As long as Berlin is working more for Atlanticist interests rather than national ones, it will be almost impossible to turn the economy around, as well. Germany is now under pressure to get rid of its China dependency the same way it did with Russia. The consequences like loss of access to critical minerals, which China increasingly controls, are rarely considered. And so here’s Germany provocatively sending its Navy ships through the Taiwan Strait. Nobody is too sure what this achieves other than showing Berlin’s commitment to Washington’s goals. Or maybe the government in Germany is just a glutton for punishment. Aside from Ukraine, no one has been hurt more than Germany by war against Russia. The loss of Russian natural gas drove the final nail through the coffin of Germany’s economic model, the reverberations of which are still being felt. Here we are 2.5 years later and Berlin is now struggling to phase out coal. All the economic news out of the country is an endless stream of bad to worse. Intel just canceled a planned microchip manufacturing center. Volkswagen is looking at closing some operations. And many other crown jewels of German industry are doing the same. This would be bad news anywhere, but especially in Germany where manufacturing still accounts for nearly a quarter of the German economy and employs 20 percent of the German workforce. If the destruction of the Nord Stream pipelines (and ensuing damage to the German economy) severed the relationship between Moscow and Berlin, the plan to station US long range missiles in Germany starting in 2026 is an attempt to guarantee it remains severed. A more sovereign Germany would not be “supporting” Ukraine, the state that was behind the Nord Stream bombings according to Germany’s own investigation. Berlin would be working to get the gas flowing again. And it certainly wouldn’t agree to host US missiles aimed at Moscow. The centrist Atlanticists of course endorsed that latter move while the AfD and BSW opposed it. From DW: “Chancellor Scholz is not acting in Germany’s interest,” said Tino Chrupalla, co-leader of the AfD, which continues to oppose German arms deliveries to Ukraine. “He is allowing Germany’s relationship with Russia to be permanently damaged, and we are falling back into the pattern of the East-West conflict,” Chrupalla said, adding that the US missile deployment would make “Germany a target.” And that’s the point. It locks Germany into a self-destructive role on the frontlines of the New Cold War. That’s a position that already requires hundreds of billions to in support for the German economy. The German business association BDI just released a study claiming that 20 percent of industrial value creation in the country is under threat. At the top of the list of causes is high energy prices and it says Germany needs about $1.55 trillion of investment by 2030. Businesses looking for help covering the self-imposed energy crisis aren’t the only ones looking for more money from Berlin. As Project Ukraine reaches its inevitable conclusion there is no sign that the hostility towards Russia will abate (see the European Parliament vote above), and Germany is also facing pressure from all sides to pony up for common EU debt that would be used to purchase more expensive and less reliable US liquified natural gas and fund military purchases by the bloc. The hits are likely to keep coming for Germany as the economy continues to slide, social spending is cut further, military spending increases, and even more pressure is piled on to “derisk” from China. All that means that the newfound concern about immigration likely ain’t going to cut it with voters, and the Atlanticists are going to have an increasingly difficult time keeping up the hardline Russia positions as the AfD and BSW continue to increase their support. Looking Forward to 2025 From the German sovereignist side, there was some hope that the CDU might be consumed by infighting ahead of the 2025 national elections the same way they were in 2021, which could open the door to further AfD and BSW gains. CDU chief Friedrich Merz and the head of Bavaria’s conservatives, Markus Soeder, recently buried the hatchet, however, and Merz will be the undisputed CDU candidate for chancellor. The CDU remains at the top of national polls and is fortunate to be out of power as the economy worsens. Merz, however, is also a former Blackrock executive and is not well-liked. As of now, Merz fully supports Atlanticist positions like continuing to support Project Ukraine and the sationing of the US long range missiles in Germany. Can Wagenknecht force a change there through government-forming negotiations in East Germany states? We’ll see. There is ongoing talk of Chancellor Scholz stepping aside ala Biden, but the election results in Brandenburg yesterday likely bought him more time. While the SPD didn’t completely embarrass itself like it did in the June European elections and the two state elections earlier this month, Scholz’s chancellorship is still on life support. He remains historically unpopular, and the party’s win in Brandenburg likely had to do more with the governor’s popularity as well as the strategic shift in support from the center-right CDU to the center-left SPD in order to prevent an AfD win. It would still be surprising to see Scholz as the SPD candidate next year. Defense minister Boris Pistorius who has been pounding the table for endless military spending ever since he was plucked from the obscure position as the Lower Saxony State Minister of the Interior and Sports is the man who’s always named as Scholz’s likely replacement. He continues to be the most popular politician in Germany. Why? Well, at least one recent poll shows that a clear majority of Germans support more national defense spending. It wouldn’t make much sense to promote him to chancellor now as that would mean he’d start to receive the blame for the slow economic collapse. Best to switch out Scholz closer to the 2025 election and present Pistorius as the face of change. Habeck is already slated to be the Green candidate. The party somewhat inexplicably still polls around 10 percent, but then again the party is also sometimes described as a cult. National AfD support has leveled off in recent months, but it might still have the chance to become the CDU’s junior partner in the next government. Would that mean the AfD caves on some of anti-NATO and German sovereignty positions or does the CDU continue to move towards the AfD as it has on immigration? And then there’s Wagenknecht, head of the party that bears her name and one that is still building itself out after launching nine months ago. How much higher of a ceiling does she have? Her broad appeal suggests a decent amount more — if she can continue to connect her antiwar stance to the dire straits of the economy. The AfD voter is typically younger, male, less well-educated, and working class, and the CDU is more heavily supported by older, wealthier voters. Wagenknecht, on the other hand, draws voters more evenly from across social demographic groups. Despite all the media efforts to lump Wagenknecht and the AfD together as Kremlin-controlled, anti-democratic far-right threats, the fact is the parties are polar opposites. Just a few examples: Unlike the ruling coalition, Wagenknecht has been careful not to criticize AfD supporters, and unlike other parties, Wagenknecht says she will work with the AfD on issues where there is overlap, i.e., Russia and NATO, since that’s about the only area of common vision. The simultaneous surge from the AfD and Wagenknecht is putting the CDU between a rock and a hard place. Either uphold the firewall against the AfD and form alliances with BSW after making concessions to Wagenknecht on long range missiles and general Russia policy. Or bring the AfD, which has been dubbed the second coming of Hitler for years now, into power and potentially dent CDU support in the process. Either way, the post-WWII German “consensus” of stable center coalitions is quickly coming to an end. Considering how much damage the current government has done to Germany, it can’t come soon enough. The problem is that even if — and it’s a big if — the AfD and/or BSW can succeed it making Berlin work for German interests again, the world isn’t standing still while Berlin tries to sort itself out. Russia’s economy, unlike Germany’s, wasn’t dependent on the Nord Stream pipelines as it is simply redirecting supplies towards China, India, and others as part of its Eurasian integration. Russian officials including President Vladimir Putin still insist that they’ll turn on the gas in the one Nord Stream pipeline that is still operational. Germany hasn’t taken them up on the offer. While German industry would likely be facing difficulties these days one way or the other due to its decades-long reliance on the wage suppression model, a lack of investment, and the rise of Chinese manufacturing, the loss of cheap and reliable Russian energy made it so all these problems are now weighing on Germany simultaneously. The Greens’ insistence that Germany close its remaining nuclear power plants only made the situation more dire. In the meantime, things could always get worse before they get better. Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck is today hosting representatives from Germany’s once-powerful automobile industry at a “car summit” to determine a way forward. With Habeck’s track record, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the steady flow of industry out of the country turn into a stampede for the exits following the meeting. Excellent overview. Thanks, Conor, for a more sensible analysis than most commentators employed by German media are capable of. The anti-AfD hysteria has been off the charts, with supposedly serious pundits hallucinating that it’s 1933 all over again. Excellent summary. The legacy parties are shit scared of peace in Ukraine. If Puin is clever and grants the existence of Ukraine provided she won´t become part of NATO the inevitable question in Germany will be what was all of that for? Everybody knows that and therefore the German political establishment is just as shitless as Selensky. Wagenknecht´s problem is that she opposes Nationalism but her opposition to NATO is based on the politics of Germany first. She won´t admit that but it unites her with the AFD to an extent that is utterly scandalous to the ruling elites. Let´s see what happens. I can only hope that she ignores the firewall. The legacy parties are shit scared of peace in Ukraine. Maybe being in an anglophone bubble has inured me with cynicism, but I don’t understand why the parties would care. Can’t they just ignore the issue and get the media to pivot to something else? Germany was set up as a Parteistaat. If Lenin designed CPSU to be Vanguard of Proletariat then German Parties were entrusted to embody the General Will in German State and they divided up the spoils. Lots of jobs depend on political alignment and not only in public sector. Then there is Atlantik-Brücke and any politico looking for US Dollar privilege needs to belong. There are lots of ways to serve USA Germany uses Direct Mandate plus List. Greens have 16 directly elected MPs and 113 on List like Baerbock who has no constituency unlike Habeck The List is a Party thing and where you are on the List is key – so if you get 5% across nation you get extra seats and more taxpayer money for Party. Germany has largest legislature on earth – then again in terms of physical structure White House is a shack compared to Federal chancellery in Berlin Parties are rich – SPD owns a cruise liner and FDP has a castle in Spain – SPD owns lots of newspapers Ladies and gentlemen, consider this statement: “Nobody is too sure what this achieves other than showing Berlin’s commitment to Washington’s goals.” I ask, Is there a better definition of slavery? Outstanding article. Thank you. Tom67: Let´s see what happens. It’s already clear what will happen. [1] In 2-3 months the issues of immigration and Ukraine will converge in Germany as Ukrainians flee West because of the wintertime collapse of Ukraine’s energy grid, which is foreordained as the Russians have already destroyed sufficient grid capability. An already-overstretched Germany has no means — no housing, schools, etc — to receive another 500k migrants, and under ordoliberal economics German cities and villages, whose mayors repeatedly have said the boat is full, will be particularly hard hit. [2] The German national system will therefore reel as it hasn’t done since WW2 and the current utterly inept political leaders, having demonstrably not a clue, will have no recourse but denial of the problems, which will then worsen and become more destabilizing. [3] Because Germany was the industrial economic motor of the EU, the EU will also increasingly become destabilized. As this will be occurring simultaneously with the US election and its outcome — also inevitably destabilizing there, whoever the notional winner — Putin has no reason either to discontinue the slow grind in Ukraine and the consequent degradation of US/NATO capabilities, or to accept any rump Ukrainian state that might pretend it won’t enter NATO only to rescind its word a few years later. Putin and Russia are thus most likely to continue the war till Ukraine has effectively been flattened as an independent nation-state with any potential to be a threat to Russia at any time in the foreseeable future. Not incidentally, here’s the mirror world version of Conor’s piece, from the FT and its editor Germany, political extremism and the risks to Ukraine archived – https://archive.ph/MKZQV original – https://www.ft.com/content/b009c2e6-790f-489d-98e6-c36e856401bb “Combine the AfD vote with that of the Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW) and something like a third of Germans — and many more in eastern Germany — are voting for populist parties that are militantly anti-migration, hostile to Nato and determined to cut off aid to Ukraine. When Volodymyr Zelenskyy addressed the Bundestag in June, all but four of the AfD’s 77 members boycotted his speech. “The policy stances taken by the AfD and BSW, combined with accusations that many AfD members have an undeclared agenda that is even more extremist, mean that Germany’s traditional parties will refuse to go into coalition with the populists — at least at the national level. But the rise of the political extremes is already having an influence on government policies. Germany’s decision to impose border controls with its EU neighbours reflects the angst about illegal migration that the populists have capitalised on.” And so, blah, blah, blah. I read Gideon Rachmann’s book Easternisation, he is a total US stooge, why do these people lie so easily, they have no morals?! (Not surprised the Chinese banned him). Your first phrase might turn to be exactly the factor that clicks the political shift button, and not only in Germany. Though i am probably being too optimistic as usual. In the news in Germany yesterday they claimed that a large part of the voters who cast their ballot for SPD did that not because they like SPD but to block AfD from winning. Fascinating that they actually allowed this piece of information go through. SPD is standing on a house of sand. “I don’t care who votes. I care who counts the votes.” Or words to that effect. I registered some fleeting content recently that claimed the legacy German parties successfully changed the recent “outcome” in an important local election from cold to hot, by means of post-hoc “discovery of discrepancies. “ Was I just dreaming this, since the article makes no mention of electoral finagling? Though I think that in most of the West, elections are just window dressing to “legitimize” the rules the elite adopt for us mopes, based on pure assumption of power. Yes, seemingly 75% SPD voters claim to have voted SPD to block AfD. These voters were apparently 60+ and AfD expresses concern about Postal Vote harvesting in retirement and nursing homes There is nowadays 30% postal voting in elections and it has been a feature in fraud in U.K. and US and Germany Conor, thank you so much for this window into German politics and the German economy. Most enlightening. US Colony or Sovereign State? A Colony Yes, how can a state be sovereign when it’s occupied by tens of thousands of foreign soldiers? One thing AfD can do however is push for a Committee to investigate COVID in at least 3 state legislatures which can only discredit CDU and SPD and CSU As for the one German frigate ‚menacing‘ China – even though it is at 7000 tonnes a bit overweight and under- gunned it poses no threat to Chinese Type 052 or Type 055 vessels Germany is a bit of a joke in that it cannot even crew its ships The country has been under US supervision since Dawes in 1924 and even the 1933-45 Chancellor was funded by US patrons and supplied by Standard Oil and Brown Bros. throughout war. In 1947 US arranged with Adenauer to give him his Rheinland Republik as a Catholic CDU stronghold and jettison the Protestant East as a Soviet Zone Since 1990 ALL leaders of CDU have been Protestant and its Catholic identity is gone. It now has worst relations with France since 1940 and probably the same with Poland whereas Russia is at 1941 levels. AfD is the Party of East German Youth who want a change from the corrupt party system – watch Fassbinder movies to see what I mean – he had exquisite gems like Lola – he was insightful All this sailing by US & Co is not to threaten Mainland China, but to keep the Taiwan Straights open and not subject to Chinese control, as it would be if the alliance would be seriously recognizing One China Policy rather than just paying lip service… Peter Lee aka China hand mused once that the Chinese escalatory ladder doesn’t involve ramping to an invasion on Taiwan, but declaring the straights internal waters under Chinese jurisdiction and impose such control. NATO treaty doesn’t provide for attacks outside those countries territories… I thought distance between China and Taiwan was 180km but that navigable channels were much narrower China could note busiest sea lane is English Channel where French sovereign waters overlap with British being 22 miles apart yet international shipping moves and even warships access these waters Turkey in contrast has Montreux Treaty defining rights of passage China has reasons to be wary of Western warships after what was done to China in 19th and 20th Centuries >Diddy/Puff Daddy After scrolling through Tweet after Tweet on this person, I finely looked him up just now. All I knew is that he is some kind of rapper, that there was a video recently of him beating up his girlfriend. I’m not interested in that music/genre. There are three topics that seem to be dominating my feeds, Israel continued genocide/aggression/censorship, Ukraine, and Diddy. Sean Love Combs (born Sean John Combs; November 4, 1969), also known by his stage name Diddy, formerly Puff Daddy and P. Diddy,[4][5] is an American rapper, record producer and record executive Apparently this guy is the Jeffery Epstein of Hollywood with overlap with politicians. All I can conclude is that the rot has metastasized through many different strata of this society. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Combs Sorry, I should have posted this under the daily Links. Don’t worry, an interesting segue! And then there’s Wagenknecht, head of the party that bears her name and one that is still building itself out after launching nine months ago. How much higher of a ceiling does she have? Her broad appeal suggests a decent amount more — if she can continue to connect her antiwar stance to the dire straits of the economy. Wagenknecht sounds like one of neoliberalism most hated foes: Traditional left opposition. The neoliberal system has traditionally been very effective at crushing or coopting such opposition, which ultimately left room for only wingnuttery. But now as “mainstream” parties fall into ever more political, economic, and cultural wingnuttery themselves, increasingly skittish middle class voters are beginning to look around for exits (to date blocked with aforementioned wingnuts). But seeing as how the main stage appears to be on fire anyway, and the entrances are stuffed with street-fighters, suddenly the old left/labor fire-exit next to the mouldy storeroom is looking like a brighter spot to camp. If you think the surveillance state has been harsh on online dissidents, wait till you see how politicians like this get treated. “Wagenknecht sounds like one of neoliberalism most hated foes:” Yes, a bloody grownup who has no difficulty in detecting her arse from ahole in the ground. LOL, truly excellent comment! Thanks! Hadn’t heard that expression for a long time!! The party somewhat inexplicably still polls around 10 percent, but then again the party is also sometimes described as a cult. It’s the party of the German PMC (“Müslibourgeoisie”). The Greens have succesfully catered to the material and ideological interests of its core electorate (urban, academic, West-German). It lost the trust of young voters, but other than that it’s doing just fine. Not inexplicable at all. It is called the Asylindustrie. Psychologists, teachers, administrators, doctors, dentists, lawyers, asylum officers, property owners (the government pays good reliable rent and renovates the properties afterwards), construction people, used car dealers all are feeding at the immigration trough. Our local hospital is busy and full mostly with asylum seekers. It is the only remaining growth industry in Germany. The tend to vote Green. Thank you, Conor. Not entirely off topic. I would like to bring to the attention of readers to an appointment in France. Benjamin Haddad has just been appointed European affairs minister. Not only is he a Macronist, but, perhaps, less well known, associate of von der Leyen and US MIC funded think tanks, so Atlanticist. Readers may have come across recent interviews given by Dominique de Villepin. One can compare the pair and lament how far France has fallen. the fallout from the quackery of free trade will take decades, if we last that long. Gerhard Schroder the bill clinton/tony blair of germany, sacrificed german labor and investment, to ride the surplus from free trade, to the detriment of just about all E.U. countries. free traders are of course idiots, that think a system like that is sustainable. everything was sacrificed for exports. now the under investment, and suppressed labor rights has come to bloom. germany became overly dependent on other countries and lost its sovereignty. germany now faces what the west faces. they are dependent on the east. and they somehow think that they now have leverage over the east. germany will end up resorting to terrorism like the rest of the west, its all they have left. thus you sail your ships(fat open targets) thousands of miles away. in a desperate hope to have some leverage. In terms of the question posed in your headline, we shouldn’t forget that German “sovereignty” is an idea that has always made neighbours of that country nervous, and continues to do so. A Germany firmly anchored in NATO and the EU and a loyal ally of the US was a Germany other people could live with. The Germans knew this, and up until a generation ago were the loyalest of allies and the firmest of orthodox believers. Reunification, economic strength, the decline of France and Brexit have complicated things a lot, and I’m not sure the German system has been able to adapt quickly enough. The German psyche continues to be a mystery to the rest of us. It seems that only Russia is not affraid of a sovereign Germany and never was… Sorry, humbly disagree. The fundamental tropes have changed. What you are referring to were fears – as I understand – rooting entirely in pre-1945. The basic assumptions of how power works and has to be sold have changed. Even if supremacist convictions still exist. I would argue they do so in neo-colonialist forms in ALL of EU. Not only Germany. EU´s power projection has shrunk by magnitudes since 1939. So today they have to unite forces to terrorize the world one last time. Which would pit against each other not Germany and her neighbours but Europe and her neighbours. After all European WMDs are unlikely but with a jingoist EU Commission not out of this world. And then what? How will the situation look like in 15 years? Will the world more likely be trembling of a rogue Germany or rather a rogue EU equipped with nukes of its own? – after a US focusing exclusively on China has agreed on letting lose (which under very desperate circumstances they might really do. As part of sharing with EU the work to fight BRICS.) p.s. What I dare not predict is the fate of the EU if US were forced to retreat in the very long term. When unipolarity has de facto ended and the EU been overtaken in all areas. But by then German clout will have completely gone up in smoke. And thus its potential for harm and cause for fear. And then e.g. what is Poland going to do with its huge army of tanks? Attack Turkey (as the biggest sparring partner so to speak)? Will Europe then fall apart in 3 or 4 mini-alliances? In that respect your point again very much deserves consideration but with the other powers not to be dismissed. EU did not exist in 1939 not until after 1993 in fact. There is no EU Military – US will not permit it since it would undermine US control of NATO Germany like Italy has a major demographic problem. In addition Europe has no nuclear weapons – only U.K. and France do – and they are of doubtful value. Germany will break up. It has never existed within the same borders for more than 40 years in its entire history. It has no internal logic. If you google Allied maps for 1945- you see different constellations for Germany envisaged by different Allied leaders EU itself is dying. It was essential for Germany as a captive market but now German Capitalism is footloose in China and USA so does not really need it – German Banks used to own German companies in interlocking shareholdings before Schröder gave them a capital gains tax benefit and they sold out and became US style gamblers in financial markets Germany is in NATO because of Diem Bien Phu. Germany had an army because of Korean War. EEC was created by Treaty of Rome to enable rearmament in Germany pushed by USA – to be acceptable to France which had rejected the European Defence Force in 1954. US had to bribe Turkey to let Germany join NATO by forcing Germany to import its male overpopulation as labour – and Germany called them Gastarbeiter. France got to control iron and steel through EEC and when Germany reunified at US insistence and against wishes of U.K. and France – Mitterand made Germany give up D-Mark so France could control Bundesbank as ECB – Germany got to have ECB in Frankfurt as a sop Asking myself what would change if – in a fictional scenario – AfD in 2025 were to form the government with Alice Weidel as chancellor. Something tells me not much. Leave the EU? Nope. Unless they would be teaming up with BSW as second or third force in parliament and Wagenknecht doing what Oskar Lafontaine had been doing shortly, as minister of finance. And possibly creating enough energy to do some major economic changes on a quid-pro-quo deal basis. But what in fact would change? Ending support for Ukraine? Open cooperation with Russia? Repairing NS2? All of that would merely be a status quo ante. Be a bit harsher on immigration than SPD already is? Most changes might concern fringe areas as freedom of theatres and art funding – perhaps. So what are people hysterical about? Law enforcement biased against true left groups? Already is. Racist? Already is. So this would only matter if this were expanded into a what-if over Wagenknecht and BSW leading the country instead. But that´s even less likely. I am not even sure AfD has enough good people to actually staff all necessary posts. p.s. the only single issue where something could happen for real is to stop the planned stationing of missiles. It´s the least controversial among oppositional groups and easiest to grasp for anyone. (WORLD WAR 3, “we-all-gonna-die” kinda thing) The Politicians who shut down Murican Bases and kick out NATO-Murican Troops being hosted there for Tours should make it happen. A rough translation of a Bismarck quote from of one the commonplace book I kept as a student 60 years ago which seems to me to get to the essense of the problem Germany and the rest of the Collective West have created for themselves: “Don’t think that in taking advantage of Russia’s weakness, it will pay you dividends forever. Russia always comes for its money. And when it comes – don’t rely on any agreement you’ve signed. Agreements are not worth the paper they are written on. Therefore, play fair with Russia, or don’t play”. President Putin is a great admirer of Bismarck and has read about him widely and deeply; it seems that the for the present German leadership, history began in 1945 and Bismarck and statecraft just doesn’t enter into it. Three things I learned from my Russian students are, they don’t lie; they so what they say; and they have no respect for you if you do no observe these niceties. Excellent overview. On the manufacturing front, there is Volkswagen’s (VW’s) ditching of the 87-year old job guarantee and threat to close facilities in Germany. Already smaller auto-suppliers are throwing in the towel (all in German and still have not learned to do links): Erwin Lutz https://www.merkur.de/wirtschaft/deutscher-autozulieferer-ist-insolvent-alle-mitarbeiter-erhalten-kuendigung-93300203.html Recaro Automotive https://www.chip.de/news/Traditioneller-Zulieferer-insolvent-Naechste-Pleite-in-Autoindustrie_185394808.html WKW https://www.merkur.de/wirtschaft/insolvent-autozulieferer-insolvenz-firma-wkw-wuppertal-vw-bmw-mercedes-zr-93313169.html Recaro was bought by a Detroit-based private equity firm in 2020 called Raven Acquisitions. They might have just done a private equity thing and they are dumping the workers, the IG Metal contracts and factory in high cost Germany. In the old days if business slowed down companies in Germany would slow down production and cut costs and wait it out but that is not the private equity style. If Raven Acquisitions owns the patents and designs maybe they can build the seats cheaper in China or Mexico or license the name to some Chinese or Indian company. They were a specialty maker and I always liked their seats and had them in my Porsche and my Mercedes. People that wanted Recaro seats were not price sensitive. So going bankrupt does not sound like a good explanation. It sounds more like US financial engineering than not being able to make money in good seating. Actually Recaro is alive and well. It sold off its automotive seating to Johnson Controls in 2011 and Johnson split and Adient became new owner. Recaro licensed its name but continues to make aircraft seating and gaming chairs etc It’s difficult for me to contain my glee (or Schadenfreude, I perhaps should say). When one auto parts manufacturer after the other goes insolvent like that, and Volkswagen AG is planning to shut down German factories for the first time since its founding in 1937, those are not good signs. This especially since I remember Audi (part of the VW Group) sort of leading the anti-Russian charge, complete with Ukrainian flags in its advertising. Now Volkswagen AG are leading the pack into oblivion. Good riddance, and the same to the rest of German industry. 150 years as an industrial power are ending and they will *never* come back. Germany’s demographic cliff, its lack of sufficient natural resources of its own (shared with the rest of Europe, to which I don’t count Russia), and the way it has burned all bridges not just to Russia but to the entire global South with its top-of-its-lungs cheerleading of the Zionist genocide will prevent that. As someone above said, it’s a distinct possibility that Germany itself will be ripped to shreds, basically returning to its natural state. Is it just me who thinks that ‘Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW)’ was created expressly to split the anti-establishment/anti-atlanticist vote? It will be interesting if BSW and AfD are able to work together to, for example, try and end the war in Ukraine. As far as I can tell, it’s just you. Die Linke was not anti-Atlanticist in any real way. Excellent overview and analysis, Conor! Thank you for keeping us updated about the situation in Germany. Hoping BSW will continue to do well.

Bitcoin ETFs attract broad-based inflows while Ethereum sees minor activity. On Sept. 20, Bitcoin ETFs saw a total inflow of $92 million, reflecting broad-based interest across multiple funds, according to Farside data.. Fidelity’s FBTC led the market with $26.1 million in inflows, followed by Ark’s ARKB ETF with $22 million. Bitwise’s BITB ETF recorded $15.1 million, while Valkyrie’s BRRR and VanEck’s HODL ETFs added $5.2 million and $7.1 million, respectively. Invesco’s BTCO also contributed with $3.1 million in inflows, and Grayscale’s smaller BTC ETF saw $13.4 million. No significant activity was noted from BlackRock’s IBIT, Franklin’s EZBC, WisdomTree’s BTCW, or Grayscale’s primary GBTC fund, which remained flat for the day. Ethereum ETFs, in contrast, were largely inactive, with a total inflow of only $2.9 million, entirely attributed to Grayscale’s mini Ethereum ETF, ETH. All other Ethereum ETFs, including those from BlackRock, Fidelity, Bitwise, 21Shares, VanEck, Invesco, Franklin, and Grayscale’s larger ETHE, recorded no inflows or outflows. The marked difference in activity between Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs highlights a focused institutional interest in Bitcoin exposure, while Ethereum ETFs saw limited engagement.

Title: Five Dividend Achievers Raising Dividends Last Week

I am a long term buy and hold investor who focuses on dividend growth stocks I invest in Dividend Growth Stocks. These are companies that have managed to increase dividends for many consecutive years in a row. This is not a small achievement. Out of thousands of companies that are traded in the US, there are about 500 or so that have managed to increase annual dividends every single years for a decade. In order to get there, a company has to have increased earnings for a while. Getting to a ten year streak of consecutive annual dividend increases is typically an end result to a company with a unique business model, with some solid competitive advantages, which can deploy capital at high rates of return, but cannot deploy all capital at those rates. It ends up gushing a ton of cash, showering shareholders with a rising stream of cashflows. In general, companies that initiate dividends and raise them have tended to do well over time. This study from Blackrock found that dividend growers and initiators did better than dividend cutters & eliminators between 1979 and 2023. Those dividend growers also did better than non dividend payers as well as better than S&P 500. Anywho, as I mentioned above, I invest in Dividend Growth Stocks. I review dividend increases as part of my monitoring process. This exercise helps me monitor existing holdings and also to identify new investments for potential research. I typically focus my attention on the companies that have managed to increase for at least a decade. Over the past week, there were five companies that BOTH managed to increase dividends last week AND also have a ten year track record of increasing dividends. These companies include: IDACORP, Inc. (IDA) engages in the generation, transmission, distribution, purchase, and sale of electric energy in the United States. The company increased quarterly dividends by 3.60% to $0.86/share. This is the 13th consecutive annual dividend increase for this dividend achiever. Over the past decade, it has managed to grow dividends at an annualized rate of 7.40%. Between 2014 and 2023, the company managed to grow earnings from $3.86/share to $5.15/share. The company is expected to earn $5.39/share in 2024. The stock sells for 18.97 times forward earnings and has a dividend yield of 3.36%. Investar Holding Corporation (ISTR) operates as the bank holding company for Investar Bank that provides a range of commercial banking products to individuals, professionals, and small to medium-sized businesses in south Louisiana, southeast Texas, and Alabama in the United States. The company raised quarterly dividends by 5% to $0.105/share. This is the tenth consecutive annual dividend increase for this newly minted dividend achiever. The company has managed to grow dividends at an annualized rate of 20.80% over the past five years. Between 2014 and 2023, the company managed to grow earnings from $0.98/share to $1.69/share. The company is expected to earn $1.49/share in 2024. The stock sells for 13.20 times forward earnings and has a dividend yield of 2.14%. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) operates as a financial services company worldwide. It operates through four segments: Consumer & Community Banking (CCB), Corporate & Investment Bank (CIB), Commercial Banking (CB), and Asset & Wealth Management (AWM). The company raised quarterly dividends by 8.70% to $1.25/share. This is the 14th consecutive annual dividend increase for this dividend achiever. The company has managed to grow dividends at an annualized rate of 11.50% over the past decade. Between 2014 and 2023, the company managed to grow earnings from $5.33/share to $16.25/share.

Texas Instruments Incorporated (TXN) designs, manufactures, and sells semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers in the United States and internationally.

Its decision marks another step in expanding the range of derivative products linked to Bitcoin, providing investors with additional tools for managing exposure to the world’s largest crypto. BlackRock had been seeking approval for such a listing since at least March of this year following the regulator's approval for multiple Bitcoin-linked ETFs in the U.S. The SEC’s approval follows several amendments submitted by Nasdaq ISE, which sought to address concerns over market manipulation and excessive risk-taking in the fledgling crypto options market. It follows several requests to amend rule changes to allow for the listing of options tied to Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in the U.S., which have faced resistance over market stability concerns. A key amendment sets position and exercise limits for options on IBIT at 25,000 contracts—described by the exchange as "extremely conservative" given the size of the market and the trust’s liquidity, SEC filing records show. Options on IBIT will be physically settled and feature American-style exercise, offering a hedge for investors looking to manage Bitcoin-related risks. BlackRock’s ETF, which tracks the price of Bitcoin, has attracted significant attention from both retail and institutional investors since it launched earlier this year, becoming one of the most liquid Bitcoin-related products in the U.S. market. Despite the approval, the SEC's move comes amid ongoing concerns about the potential risks associated with cryptocurrency derivatives. Comment letters submitted during the review process highlighted worries over market volatility and the broader integration of crypto into traditional financial markets. Some urged the SEC to delay approval until the Bitcoin market further stabilized. In any case, the SEC found that the exchange’s surveillance mechanisms, including real-time monitoring and inter-market surveillance-sharing agreements with the CME, would be sufficient to deter manipulation.

Title: In 1962, being the worst in baseball was no bad thing

So, the Chicago White Sox looks like not just the worst team to date in the 21st century but in baseball history, too. As the seasons end, summer fades, and autumn leaves begin to drop, the White Sox are on their way to recording the most losses in the history of America’s National Past Time. Normally, most baseball fans root for records to be broken. Think of Hank Aaron breaking Babe Ruth’s home run record, a mark that stood until Barry Bonds bested Aaron (although we still don’t know if performance-enhancing drugs made the difference), or Cal Ripken’s victory lap in Camden Yards when he passed Lou Gehrig in consecutive games played. The nation even cheered when Pete Rose broke Ty Cobb’s record for most hits in baseball history. Americans, especially rabid baseball fans, love the pursuits, probably because we have a deep affection for the player and partly because we all have a little Walter Mitty in us, which project onto our beloved athletes. That’s not the case for the White Sox’s record. Image: The 1962 Mets (cropped). YouTube screen grab. If they have the longest losing streak ever, they’ll erase the record of one of the most beloved teams—albeit a bunch of big-time losers—in baseball history, the 1962 New York Mets. If the White Sox beat that record, baseball will lose some of its charm and romance, for fans loved those losing Mets. The 2024 White Sox do not and will not have the personality, charisma, or legendary status the Mets had in 1962. The club mostly consisted of former Dodgers and Giants who had played in Gotham before those teams moved to California before the 1958 season and still paid homage to those esteemed franchises. (The old Dodgers and Giants had appeared in every World Series from 1947-1958 except for 1948, 1950, 1957, and 1958.) The Mets franchise filled the vacuum left by the teams that called Brooklyn and Upper Manhattan home. The first Mets team plucked old, over the hill or over-their-head players off LA’s and SF’s roster to provide a sense of nostalgia for National League fans in New York who felt betrayed when their teams moved west and would good never, in good conscience, root for their bitter rivals in the American League (i.e., the Yankees). To the fans, the Yankees were corporate-think Microsoft, Facebook, or Blackrock. In contrast, the Dodgers were the neighborhood team, the “mom and pop shop” team of Flatbush. As for the Giants, though not as “blue collar” as the Trolley Dodgers, they still had the greatest player in the last 100 years, Willie Mays. But back to that 1962 season. Colorful stories abounded about outrageous incidents that were too preposterous to be staged or fabricated. There was the Yankee’s one-time manager, Casey Stengel, summarily fired in 1960, despite guiding the Yankees to seven World Series titles in ten years. He responded, “I’ll never make the mistake of being seventy again.” The colorful Stengel was then named the first manager of the New York Mets franchise. Casey did not disappoint, although not as a strategic manager guiding a new team to unbelievable heights of winning. Instead, he just so darn colorful, providing endless anecdotes, including the fact that he sometimes Casey fell asleep on the bench. The Mets team was no better. Casey was coaching players who simply couldn’t play the game nor compete like his great Yankees teams of the 1940s and 1950s. But Casey’s honest evaluation of one of his players—“Look at that guy. He can’t hit, he can’t run, and he can’t throw. Of course, that’s why they gave him to us”—ending up causing the franchise’s to embrace rather than ostracize their players. For Casey, his players were “The Amazings,” not for their incredible play but because of the beauty, fun, and frolics they brought to each game. They lost every one of their 120 games in a unique way. It’s different with the White Sox. Notwithstanding the energy and professionalism each team member brings to the game, their inability to excite baseball is why baseball fans can’t root for them to win. It would be a shame if their boring, bland, colorless brand of losing led them to break the record and erase the “accomplishments” of baseball’s real “worst club of all time” from the record books. Or as Casey would state, “Without the losers, where would the winners be?” The ‘62 Amazings were winners...in a losing fashion. So, the Chicago White Sox looks like not just the worst team to date in the 21st century but in baseball history, too.

Title: Big three money managers cut support for climate proposals

Subscribe Today's print edition Home Delivery The three biggest US money managers slashed their support of environmental and social shareholder proposals, marking a stark turnaround from 2021, when they voted in favor of a record number of such resolutions. State Street’s investing unit said on Thursday that it supported 6% of environmental shareholder proposals in the first half of the year and 7% of social ones, less than what it did in the same year-ago period. Vanguard Group said last month that it didn’t back any of those resolutions, while BlackRock said it voted for 4% of the proposals in the 12 months ending June, down from 7% a year earlier. Together, the three money managers have immense influence during proxy season because they collectively own about 20% of the shares of all companies in the S&P 500, mainly through their enormous index-tracking funds.

Title: “Building the AI infrastructure of the future” — Microsoft partners with BlackRock for $30BN+ fund to develop and power data centers

Nvidia will also support Global AI Infrastructure Investment Partnership (GAIIP) When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Microsoft has partnered with investment giant BlackRock to launch the Global AI Infrastructure Investment Partnership (GAIIP), a fund exceeding $30 billion aimed at developing critical infrastructure for artificial intelligence advancements. The collaboration includes Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) and MGX, and is focused on building data centers and energy projects necessary to power next-generation AI technologies. The investments will primarily target the United States, supporting the expansion of computing power and energy resources, with additional investments planned in partner countries. The partnership maintains an open architecture, granting non-exclusive access to a diverse range of companies and organizations. AI darling Nvidia will also play a role in the initiative, assisting in enhancing AI data centers. The goal of GAIIP is to unlock $30 billion in private equity capital initially, potentially reaching $100 billion when combined with debt financing. Larry Fink, Chairman and CEO of BlackRock, said, "Mobilizing private capital to build AI infrastructure like data centers and power will unlock a multi-trillion-dollar long-term investment opportunity. Data centers are the bedrock of the digital economy, and these investments will help power economic growth, create jobs, and drive AI technology innovation.” GAIIP's formation comes at a time when the demand for AI infrastructure is rapidly increasing. By pooling resources from leading global investors and technology companies, the partnership aims to accelerate the development of essential infrastructure for an AI-driven future. Brad Smith, Vice Chair and President of Microsoft, noted that the capital required for AI infrastructure and new energy sources is more than any single company or government can finance. "This financial partnership will not only help advance technology, but enhance national competitiveness, security, and economic prosperity," he said. "Accelerated computing and generative AI are driving a growing need for AI infrastructure for the next industrial revolution," said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia. "Nvidia will use its expertise as a full-stack computing platform to support GAIIP and its portfolio companies on the design and integration of AI factories to propel industry innovation."

Title: JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon Calls For Federal Employees To Return To Office, Says Empty Buildings 'Bother' Him: 'I Can't Believe...'

Skip to comments. Posted on 09/22/2024 2:27:03 PM PDT by MinorityRepublican JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has called for federal employees in Washington, DC, to return to their offices, highlighting the ongoing debate over remote work policies. What Happened: Speaking at The Atlantic Festival, Dimon expressed his frustration with the number of empty buildings in the capital, according to Business Insider on Friday. “By the way, I’d also make Washington, DC, go back to work. I can’t believe, when I come down here, the empty buildings. The people who work for you not going to the office,” he stated, “That bothers me,” he added. Dimon emphasized that he does not allow such flexibility at JPMorgan. Why It Matters: Dimon is not alone in his stance. Earlier this week, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy announced that Amazon employees would return to the office five days a week, reverting to pre-pandemic norms. JPMorgan’s policy mandates managing directors to be in the office full-time, while other employees must work in person at least three days a week. Last year, the Biden Administration also pushed federal employees to return to in-person work. (Excerpt) Read more at benzinga.com ...

I can’t believe, when I come down here, the empty buildings. The people who work for you not going to the office,” he stated, “That bothers me,” he added. Dimon emphasized that he does not allow such flexibility at JPMorgan. Why It Matters: Dimon is not alone in his stance. Earlier this week, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy announced that Amazon employees would return to the office five days a week, reverting to pre-pandemic norms. JPMorgan’s policy mandates managing directors to be in the office full-time, while other employees must work in person at least three days a week. Last year, the Biden Administration also pushed federal employees to return to in-person work. (Excerpt) Read more at benzinga.com ...

Title: Terenure, Garryowen and Clontarf get AIL campaigns off to flying starts

Opening-day statement wins abounded in the Energia All-Ireland League on Saturday, notable at Lakelands Park, where Terenure College avenged April’s defeat in the final against Cork Constitution with a 25-15 win over the champions. Playing with a strong breeze and inspired by their 21-year-old Leinster academy duo Henry McErlean and Fintan Gunne, Terenure roared into a 19-0 lead. McErlean finished of a crisp backline strike move off a lineout for their first try before Gunne struck twice. First, after Terenure winger Craig Adams fielded a goal line drop out and passed infield to Gunne on the 10-metre line, the former Irish under-20 scrumhalf chipped the advancing white line, gathered and stepped past the last man to score. Soon after he sniped down the blindside and grubber-kicked, McErlean regathering and feeding Conall Boomer. The number eight was stopped short but Gunne was on hand to score again. Con responded with lineout maul tries through Munster hooker Scott Buckley and Alessandro Heaney and dominated the second half, but Terenure held on thanks to two penalties by outhalf Aran Egan. Garryowen, who returned to Divisison 1A via the playoffs on the back of an 11-match winning run, also made their intentions clear with a thrilling 29-27 win over Lansdowne at Dooradoyle. Trailing 27-24, Garryowen opted to kick a penalty to the corner and, seven phases later, their 19-year-old Munster academy outhalf Dylan Hicks cross-kicked for Gordon Wood, son of Keith, to score in the corner. St Mary’s, back in the top tier after a six-year absence, led Clontarf by 24-10 early in the second half after a try by fullback Conor Hayes, but they had to settle for two bonus points after Clontarf successfully resorted to their renowned attacking game. Hooker Dylan Donnellan was back in the old routine with two tries off catch-and-drives and tries by winger Andrew Smith and a close-range finish by replacement hooker Barry Gray late on secured a 29-27 comeback win. Young Munster had a big 24-22 win in the Belfield Bowl while Ballynahinch’s 7-0 win over City of Armagh was somewhat out of keeping with the day’s trends domestically and indeed globally. Nenagh Ormond announced their arrival in 1B in front of a huge home crowd with a dominant bonus-point win over relegated Trinity, who are evidently facing another new cycle. Old Wesley and Old Belvedere had commanding home wins over Old Wesley and UCC, and Queen’s beat Shannon, while in 2A newly promoted Corinthians had a bonus-point win away to Ballymena in JJ Hanrahan’s first game as backs coach.
