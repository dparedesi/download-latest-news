US investment holding BlackRock stopped its search for investors to back a multi-billion dollar fund for rebuilding Ukraine earlier this year, Bloomberg has reported. Interest reportedly dropped after President Donald Trump retook the White House. The fund was set to be unveiled at the Ukraine Recovery Conference in Rome next week. It had been close to securing backing from firms supported by the governments of Germany, Italy, and Poland, the outlet wrote on Saturday, citing anonymous sources. Nevertheless, BlackRock reportedly decided to shelve the talks early this year “due to a lack of interest amid increased uncertainty over Ukraine’s future,” after the US changed its stance towards Kiev under the current administration. Trump has long promised to end the Russia-Ukraine conflict and has sought avenues to reach a peace deal. He has also pushed European NATO allies to take over the burden of militarily supporting Ukraine. Earlier this week, Washington reportedly froze critical arms deliveries to Kiev to focus on replenishing its own stockpiles, although the US president has insisted some military aid still continues. The Trump administration “was a notable absence from the fund’s backers in December,” Bloomberg added. In March of last year, BlackRock vice chairman Philipp Hildebrand indicated that the Ukraine Development Fund was on track to secure at least $2.5 billion from private investors, countries and other grant lenders. A consortium of such investors could finance at least $15 billion towards reconstruction work in Ukraine, he said. However, a BlackRock spokesperson indicated that the firm is no longer engaged in “any active mandate” with Kiev, having finished its pro-bono consulting work with the Ukraine Development Fund last year, Bloomberg wrote. The investment firm, which controls roughly $11.6 trillion in assets, owns substantial shares in military-industrial giants such as Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, and Northrop Grumman, among many others. Armaments produced by these firms, which are supplied to Kiev by its Western backers, have seen extensive use in the conflict. Moscow has repeatedly condemned foreign arms supplies to Kiev, arguing that they make pro-Ukrainian Western nations party to the conflict, which Russia views as a NATO proxy war. The Kremlin has stated that the recent freeze in US military aid to Kiev will accelerate settlement of the conflict. RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2025.

Title: 'Should I still consider a pension plan If I'm already investing?'

Welcome to The Money Coach, a Times of Malta column where readers can ask questions about life's money issues. Send your questions about personal finances, inheritance, gifting or other personal finance topics to moneycoach@timesofmalta.com I have been investing consistently since the beginning of 2025. I am 23 and I want to set myself up with the possibility of retiring early at the age of 55, living solely on my investments. My portfolio is composed thusly: Primarily ETFs consisting of S&P 500, STOX600, Vanguard FTSE All World ETF, and Gold. I also have speculative investments in the fields of nuclear power, quantum computing and to a lesser degree Cryptocurrency related stocks (MicroStrategy, Etoro, Webull, BlackRock, Coinbase, (without directly buying any cryptocurrency) I have done well for myself so far with a sizeable unrealised gain and frequent dividend payments. However, I have some queries which persist. Lately, I have been bombarded with emails and calls to sign up for a Private Pension Plan. In a way, I have my investment portfolio intended to cover my retirement expenses. Is there any benefit in investing in a pension plan instead/also? What is the catch? My second question revolves around taxes. Namely I understand that taxes are paid on any realised gains. Seeing that my investments are yielding unrealised gains, and any dividends gained are reinvested; what are my obligations regarding local taxes? My third question has to do with the fact that when I near my retirement age, I need to start liquidating my assets. How would you approach this matter? Would you liquidate a lump sum every year or withdraw money from the brokerage account gradually? My last question has to do with the brokerage application I use. I have in the past dabbled with some day trading on eToro. I have moved past trading to some disciplined Dollar Cost Averaging on Trading212. I find the interface of this application intuitive as it facilitates rebalancing and the stock purchases are commission free. Trading212 has long been touted as an ideal application for beginners. But I feel a consistent sense of insecurity on the long-term (up to retirement) sustainability of the application and how would my investments be affected if the platform goes bust. Regards, Disciplined Young Investor Dear Disciplined Young Investor, First of all—well done. Many people don’t even have such a goal, let alone by age 23. The fact that you’ve already thought about retiring at 55 and are investing consistently is a strong foundation. With a time horizon of 32 years, you’re giving yourself a real chance. Historically, by consistently applying DCA (dollar-cost averaging) into the market - especially something like the S&P 500 - you’re likely to see average returns of around 8–10% per year. You’ve set yourself up well. Your portfolio appears to be thoughtfully constructed. From what you've described, you’ve included a mix of broad-based ETFs such as the S&P 500, STOXX600, and Vanguard FTSE All World, along with some exposure to gold. This type of approach is often associated with diversification and relatively lower fees. Including a smaller allocation to sectors like nuclear energy, quantum computing, and crypto-related equities suggests that you've taken an interest in emerging industries as well. While every investor's approach will differ, having a clear strategy and awareness of your overall risk profile is always a good starting point. On your question about private pension plans—here’s the straight answer: There are two main advantages: 1. 25% tax credit (capped at €750/year as of the latest update - check for changes yearly). 2. Illiquidity: This may not seem like a benefit now, but the fact that you can’t access it until retirement actually protects you from dipping into it impulsively in the future - especially when life throws unexpected costs your way. But there are drawbacks too: Whether or not to open a private pension plan depends on your personal circumstances and long-term goals. While some individuals choose to include it as part of their broader financial planning (mainly to benefit from the tax credit and the structured approach it offers) others may prefer to continue investing independently. If it’s something you’re considering, I’d suggest reviewing the terms carefully, paying close attention to all fees involved, and seeking guidance from a licensed financial advisor before making any decisions. On the tax side, it is best to always consult with a licenced tax advisor in such case. As a Financial Coach I’m afraid I cannot help you much there. On withdrawals at retirement: You don’t need to worry too much about this now, but as you near your goal of retiring at 55 (or even before), the strategy will have to shift. When that time comes It is again best to consult with a licenced tax advisor specialised on investing to see what would make most sense to your portfolio at that point in time. And lastly: Trading212. I agree that it’s intuitive, low-fee, and great for DCA. But I do understand your concern about long-term sustainability. The key question to ask is whether the platform is regulated by a major authority—like the FCA (UK), or MFSA if local. If it is, your investments are technically held with a custodian, not the platform itself, meaning that if Trading212 ever goes bust, your holdings should remain safe. That said, it’s smart to stay updated on the platform’s status, and eventually—when your portfolio gets larger—you may want to consider splitting your funds across two platforms (or more), just as an added layer of protection.

Title: Finding George Gibney: ‘I feel sad for 13-year-old me and nine-year-old Ber, who were not believed’

Earlier this week, not long after The Irish Times had printed the story of George Gibney’s arrest in the United States under the headline “George Gibney facing 79 charges relating to alleged sexual abuse of four girls,” my phone pinged. “I am so glad. But feel sad for 13 yr old me and 9 yr old Ber, who were not believed,” it said. The text was from Tric, a talented swimmer, who had been one of six people involved in a case in Ireland against Gibney in the 1990s that was halted in the Supreme Court. The sentiment had nothing to do with self-pity but the name, the arrest, the charges hit hard, like an emotional jolt from the past. The broad outline of the allegation in the news story about Gibney’s US arrest was not dissimilar to the case involving Tric Kearney, Ber Carley and others. [ US government asks court to detain George Gibney until Irish extradition case is concludedOpens in new window ] The latest legal filings lodged in the US district court showed that Gibney had been accused of 78 counts of indecent assault and one count of attempted rape over the alleged sexual abuse of four girls and the alleged attempted rape of one of the girls. Much like those allegations made decades ago, all four girls were minors, aged between eight and 15, and were coached by Gibney at the time of the alleged abuse. The text was a reminder that sometimes in the glare of headlines and the frenzy of how quickly news moves, how many charges are brought and how many people are involved, the human cost to nine- and 13-year-old girls can be forgotten. The original 1993 charges, at Dún Laoghaire District Court, were 27 counts of indecent assault and unlawful carnal knowledge of young female swimmers under the age of 15. But no case was ever heard in Dublin. Gibney’s accusers have never had their day in court and that has been a devastating truth to live with and a source of deep frustration for more than 30 years. Gibney’s lawyer argued in an Irish Supreme Court judicial review at the time that he could not defend himself, as some of the allegations went back to the 1960s. It was true, some charges did go back that far. But some were also from the 1980s, just 11 years earlier. The line of defence that allegations reached too far back in time was an idea that became a dark in-joke to those involved in the case. It was simultaneously absurd and enraging. Gibney had introduced modern ways of training to his athletes. Before his name became synonymous with allegations of abuse, he was diligent and detailed and encouraged swimmers to keep meticulous diaries so that if they swam a national or event record, they could look back and see what training they had been doing to get the time. They kept their diaries. Following on from the Supreme Court ruling, Mr Justice Declan Costello in the High Court granted an order prohibiting the Director of Public Prosecutions, Eamonn Barnes, from proceeding with the charges against Gibney. Leave to appeal was granted but no appeal was made by the State. Gibney left Ireland when he was released in July 1994, a free and innocent man in the eyes of the courts. By then the Sunday Tribune (where I was working at the time), along with Gibney’s star swimmer of the time, Gary O’Toole, a double Olympian from Seoul and Barcelona, and European Championship silver medallist, had taken up the story and published details of the allegations against the coach. In an unusual request, all swimmers who were mentioned in the Sunday Tribune were asked for sworn affidavits and agreed to be interviewed by the newspaper’s defamation lawyer Hugh Mohan. For surety, more legal advice was taken from barrister and future Supreme Court judge Adrian Hardiman. The assumption was that Gibney would sue. But he did not. By the time the story was published he was already on the move and turned up in Warrender Baths Swimming Club in Scotland, working as a coach. Warrender, who had a medical doctor on their board, were horrified when informed of the allegations made in Ireland. By the end of 1994 Gibney was sacked and fled again, this time to the US. With an uncanny knack of moving and turning up at places where they needed a swimming coach, he emerged at the North Jeffco Swim Team in Arvada in Colorado in late 1995. He seemed to be endlessly landing on his feet. [ Why has it taken so long to arrest George Gibney in the US to enable extradition?Opens in new window ] People wondered how that could be before realising that the Irish Amateur Swimming Association (IASA), the then governing body of swimming in Ireland, had robustly defended Gibney and showed him astonishing deference. An example of that was in 1992, in what most people would have considered clear grounds for standing down Gibney as national coach. After the Barcelona Olympic Games in which O’Toole competed, he wrote to the Leinster Branch requesting a meeting them in December at the Ashling Hotel in Dublin, where he was accompanied by another swimmer, Chalkie White, and the husband of a female swimmer. O’Toole spoke first to the president Harry Kavanagh, the secretary Mary O’Malley and the treasurer Eddie Eaton, telling them he believed Gibney was a paedophile and had been sexually abusive to boys and girls for years. He advised them that the gardaí were involved and taking statements from various people and alleged that Gibney had tried to get into bed with him as a young swimmer before the young O’Toole garnered the strength to ask him to leave the room. The husband said to the Leinster Branch that his wife had been repeatedly sexually abused by Gibney and White alleged that as a boy he too had been molested by the coach. O’Toole urged the Leinster Branch to remove Gibney from Irish swimming and cancel a swimming course for 11- to 15-year-olds a few weeks later in early January. However, when Gibney was asked to step away, he threatened to sue the organisation. The juvenile course went ahead with Gibney in charge. Gibney was given life membership by the IASA in 1989 and despite the court case and the Sunday Tribune coverage, it was not rescinded until the beginning of 1997. The Sunday Tribune sent their story to Colorado and Gibney was moved again, this time to California, before settling in Florida. This week, with the arrest of the 77-year-old in Florida, the image of a younger Gibney standing at the pool deck with the large round glasses and goatee beard, the timing device slung around his neck like a stethoscope and the Sergio Tacchini polo shirt, has circled around and again brought people back in time – back to a small 25-metre swimming pool in Blackrock, Co Dublin, where a club called Trojan used to train. Trojan was where talented Irish swimmers wanted to be during the 1970s and 1980s, because Gibney was one of the best. It’s where he got his break after starting out working in swimming clubs at various pools around the Dublin area, including the Guinness pool, Marian and Waterford Crystal before moving to Glenalbyn in the early 1970s – a pool that is no longer functional, located beside the Kilmacud Crokes GAA club in the suburb of Stillorgan. A convincing, can-do coach, Gibney struck up close relationships with swimmers’ parents, easily gaining their trust, and by the mid-1970s Trojan was the top club in Ireland. He had a highly convincing personality and his CV was impressive. As well as being national director of swimming, he had published works on lactate testing in swimmers. He was a member of the National Training and Coaching Centre in Limerick University and the Irish Recreational Management Association, as well as an RTÉ Sports commentator for the Barcelona Olympic Games in 1992. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s he rapidly rose through the swimming ranks in Ireland to become the Irish Olympic coach in 1988 for the Seoul Olympic Games and the IASA’s national director of swimming in 1991. But just three years after that appointment he was leaving everything he had created in Ireland. Behind were the accusers left to deal with an alleged abusive coach who they said had shattered their trust and altered their lives, a swimming association that turned away when their need was most desperate, and the rank failure of an Irish judicial system that had given process but, in their eyes, denied dignity or justice. Gibney might have been ducking and diving by state-hopping in the US, but because of the company he had kept at home, he was never far from the Irish public consciousness. By the end of 1997, Derry O’Rourke, who succeeded him as national coach, stood in the dock at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court, where he pleaded guilty to 29 sample charges of sexual abuse against 11 young swimmers on numerous occasions between 1976 and 1992. Early the following year, O’Rourke, who used to try to hypnotise his swimmers, was jailed for 12 years by Judge Kieran O’Connor. O’Rourke’s investigation began in 1993, the year Frank McCann was formally charged with the murder of his wife, Esther McCann (née Leonard), and his 18-month-old foster-daughter Jessica McCann, when he set fire to their family home in Rathfarnham. The couple had been trying to adopt Jessica, but the process had been delayed, due to information gleaned by the adoption agency that McCann, president of the IASA Leinster Branch and a swimming coach, had fathered a child with a 17-year-old student. McCann is currently serving a life sentence in Arbour Hill Prison. It would take more than another decade but Ger Doyle, a successor to both Gibney and O’Rourke as national coach, would also find himself in the dock. In 2012, the 51-year-old from Wexford pleaded not guilty to one charge of sexual assault and 34 charges of indecent assault at New Ross Swimming Pool between January 1981 and December 1993. The jury returned unanimous guilty verdicts on all charges. He was sentenced to six-and-a-half years in prison and released in 2015. To many people it beggared belief how so many figures involved at the higher levels of Irish swimming chimed so closely with allegations of child sexual abuse. But with the considerable attention and the constant pressure on the swimming association, the centre couldn’t hold, and the sport collapsed. The then minister for sport Jim McDaid stopped funding to the IASA in 1998 and set up what was ultimately an unsatisfactory inquiry, where witnesses were not compelled to attend and many did not. The Murphy Report was subsequently published in June 1998 and soon after the IASA was replaced with Swim Ireland. For many, that was the end, or at least a new beginning. But not for all. Several Irish news outlets, including the Irish Star, RTÉ’s Prime Time and the Sunday Tribune made journeys to Colorado, California, and Florida. They upset the tempo of Gibney’s life and made it uncomfortable, but didn’t move the dial regarding him answering the allegations made against him in Ireland. In 2016, Justine McCarthy, author of Deep Deception – Ireland’s Swimming Scandals and now an Irish Times columnist, reported that the Garda gave a certificate of character to George Gibney to support his application for his American visa, dated and stamped January 20th, 1992. [ For over 30 years, George Gibney has lived as a free man, without having to face a trialOpens in new window ] From the Dáil, Independent TD Maureen O’Sullivan pressed home the need for a concerted approach from the police in Hillsborough County in Florida, where Gibney lived, and the Garda in Ireland. O’Sullivan’s letters followed the work of investigative journalist Irv Muchnick at the end of 2017. He had gone to the Californian courts in his case, Irvin Muchnick v United States Department of Homeland Security, seeking details of how Gibney had come to be in the US. He asked who had helped him with employment, who had written letters of comfort, and why, given his past, he had been allowed to remain a long-time resident alien in the country. Nobody knows exactly how much pressure the reporting, the door-stepping, court hearings in the US and letter writing to their congressional members put on the Irish State to act. In February 2018, The Second Captains released a 40-minute podcast called The George Gibney Case: 25 Years On. “The greatest illusion that was perpetrated in sport ever. There was nothing about that man that was real,” said O’Toole about his former coach Gibney. Second Captains producer Mark Horgan used the quote when he wrote a piece in The Irish Times in 2020 before the release of the 10-part podcast series Where is George Gibney? The big reaction to the 2018 piece pointed to real interest in the Gibney case and prompted them to consider a greater interrogation of the story. When Dylan Haskins, the commissioning executive for podcasts with BBC Sounds, was sold the idea for something more extensive and investigative, Horgan and Ciaran Cassidy hit the road. On and off for two-and-a-half years the pair travelled across the US, where they tracked down people who had previously stayed silent. They discovered new information on Gibney’s past and the path to where he resided in Florida’s Seminole county. During one of their visits to Florida, Horgan and Cassidy confronted Gibney outside his home. But he wouldn’t talk to them, wouldn’t listen, and awkwardly got into his car and drove away. “You couldn’t shut him up,” said Horgan. “That was, until the day he decided he’d never speak publicly again.” The silence and the voiceless shuffling of Gibney as questions were barked at him reached the ears of those swimmers who had not been part of the original 1990s case. Four came forward to make statements to gardaí alleging Gibney had sexually abused them between 1971 and 1981. By 2021, with the statements gathered, detectives at the Sexual Crime Management Unit had a criminal investigation and in May 2023 a file was sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions. It directed that Gibney should face trial on 79 criminal charges; one charge of attempted rape and 78 of indecent assault. In the coming months, the outcome of the extradition and legal process in Ireland will be known. But already the four women who have made the allegations have gifted something those who went before them, something they have not had for many years. They have given them hope. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Elizabeth Plunkett: How murdered woman’s family discovered they were not ‘relevant victims’ in serial killer case

When something false is repeated often enough, it has a tendency to become accepted fact. At some point a seed of incorrect information takes root in the public discourse before spreading through newspaper articles, books and political statements. Eventually, the actual truth becomes almost impossible to discern. It is a phenomenon known to researchers as the illusory truth effect. The family of Elizabeth Plunkett came face to face with this effect in 2023 after getting a call from the Parole Board. Elizabeth was a 23-year-old woman from Ringsend in Dublin who, in 1976, was kidnapped and murdered by two English men. The killers, John Shaw and Geoffrey Evans, had come to Ireland with the aim of murdering one woman every week. A month after Elizabeth’s death, they murdered another young woman, Mary Duffy, from Co Galway, before being caught by gardaí and confessing to their crimes. Shaw and Evans became known as Ireland’s first serial killers. Both received life sentences and Evans died in custody in 2012 at the age of 72. Shaw (78) remains in Arbour Hill Prison. He is Ireland’s longest-serving prisoner. He sought to change that in 2023 by applying for parole, having already been granted release for two days a year. Under a new parole act passed in 2019, the Plunkett family had an automatic right to express their views on Shaw’s parole bid. When the family were contacted by the Parole Board, it was decided two of Elizabeth’s sisters, Bernadette Barry and Kathleen Nolan, would speak for all of the siblings. They spent hours drafting their submissions, explaining the ongoing trauma of Elizabeth’s murder and the effect it had on their parents who both died a few years afterwards. Shaw should not be released under any circumstances, they said. “I poured my heart and soul into that,” said Kathleen this week. “It was like slicing me open, with the trauma of remembering.” They repeated the process later in person during a meeting with two members of the Parole Board who would decide Shaw’s future. “We got emotional, we got angry – it was gruelling,” recalled Bernadette. Afterwards, the family put the matter to the back of their minds and prepared for the wedding of Kathleen’s daughter that summer. That August, the sisters got a call from the solicitors representing them in the parole process and were asked to come into the office on a Saturday morning. Their solicitor, James McGuill, informed them that the Parole Board had made a serious mistake. It had been discovered the Plunkett family were not “relevant victims” and therefore had no right to take part in Shaw’s parole process. This was because Shaw had in fact never been convicted of Elizabeth’s murder. Bernadette and Kathleen could not believe what they were hearing. For decades, newspaper articles and books had repeated the same “fact”: that John Shaw and Geoffrey Evans – “Ireland’s first serial killers” – were serving life for the murders of Elizabeth Plunkett and Mary Duffy. More than that, various State agencies were under the same impression. Over the years, every time Shaw or Evans was moved out of the prison, for example for hospital appointments, the Irish Prison Service (IPS) contacted the Plunkett family “as relevant victims” to let them know. Similarly, the Parole Board had contacted the family in the belief that Shaw had been convicted of Elizabeth’s murder, only to realise belatedly its mistake. “There’s retired judges on the Parole Board,” said Kathleen. “The highest echelons of Irish society get these jobs on these boards. They’re highly educated people, and yet no one checked this out.” How did this illusory truth take hold? A look through the archives provides a few clues. Shaw and Evans confessed to raping and murdering both women shortly after their capture. However, the prosecution was a convoluted affair. First, a judge granted a defence application that the men be tried separately, as each one was blaming the other for the murders. For reasons that remain unclear, the judge also ordered the men be given separate trials for each of the murdered women, meaning a total of four trials. The hearing began in July 1977, when Shaw went on trial for Mary Duffy’s rape and murder. To the surprise of many onlookers the jury became deadlocked on a verdict. He was retried and subsequently convicted. [ The late summer murders: Two men on a mission to kill Irish womenOpens in new window ] The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) then successfully appealed the original judgment mandating separate trials, meaning they could try Evans for both of the murders at the same time. Following the trial, he was convicted of Mary Duffy’s murder but, for reasons that are also unclear at this remove, the judge ordered the jury to find him not guilty of Elizabeth Plunkett’s killing. Both men were sentenced to life for Mary Duffy’s murder. Then, in 1979, the DPP dropped the charges against Shaw relating to Elizabeth’s rape and murder. To date, nothing has emerged to explain this decision. It is possible the DPP believed Shaw would never be released so there was no point in going through the expense of another trial. Like the rest of Irish society, Bernadette and Elizabeth, who were teenagers at the time, went through their life believing Shaw was in prison for their sister’s murder. They explained that during the trials, their father went to great lengths to shield the family from the trauma of the process. “The way it was in the house, it wasn’t discussed. My father would just shut down any conversation about it because it set my Mammy off. It was all about trying to keep us together because we were all ready to just lose the plot,” said Bernadette. “When you see somebody going to jail and there was a court case, you just automatically live your life thinking, yeah, they were found guilty,” said Kathleen. After being informed about the Parole Board’s mistake in August 2023, the sisters decided they would refuse to accept the label of “not relevant victims”. Their solicitor hired two barristers to examine the case. After searching through the records, the lawyers found that not only had there been no conviction for Elizabeth’s murder, no inquest had been held either. It would later emerge that a death certificate had not even been issued for the young woman. It felt like Elizabeth had been erased, the sisters said, and they were determined to address that. The sisters wrote to the Garda, the DPP and the Government but got nowhere. At that point they decided to go public and made contact with the RTÉ Documentary on One team, having been impressed by their investigation into abuse in Blackrock College. “I said to Kathleen: they’re meticulous. They have to be. Because they can’t afford to be sued after all the Ryan Tubridy thing,” joked Bernadette. The sisters have nothing but praise for the documentary team, and in particular its producer Liam O’Brien. Last month RTÉ started publishing a six-part podcast on the case called Stolen Sister. Earlier this year, thanks to the sisters’ campaign, an inquest was finally held into Elizabeth’s death which recorded a verdict of unlawful killing. However, officially, no one has been convicted of her death and the Plunkett family still have no say in Shaw’s parole. [ From the archive: State’s longest-serving prisoner in fresh bid to secure temporary releaseOpens in new window ] His last parole bid was rejected. He is expected to apply again early next year. James McGuill, their solicitor, has called on the Garda to reopen the murder investigation with a view to securing a murder conviction against Shaw. The Garda has said its investigation concluded in 1976 and the matter is one for the DPP. The family have received legal advice that, in rare cases, it is possible to reopen a case after charges are dropped. One path being pursued by McGuill and the two sisters is gathering enough new evidence to allow prosecutors to reopen the case. They have had some success to date. After the inquest, and particularly after the start of the RTÉ series, multiple women have come forward to say they believe they were also targeted by Shaw and Evans during the men’s 1976 crime spree. [ Eight women come forward with information on being targeted by 1976 killers of Elizabeth PlunkettOpens in new window ] This includes a woman who was knocked down by a car very close to where Elizabeth was abducted in Co Wicklow. These testimonies will be passed on to the Garda and DPP, McGuill said. Looking back, Kathleen says she can understand her father’s desire to protect them from the trial and why he “hid the newspapers behind the sideboard”. “When anyone would it bring up, he’d say: ‘Let Elizabeth Rest in peace’, because he couldn’t cope,” she said. Nevertheless, they are determined to keep up their campaign for Elizabeth’s case to be reopened by authorities. “They thought these two auld ones would just go away, said Bernadette. “But no, sorry, not when you’re fighting for your family.” © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Editor Crypto Bitcoin Magazine, Matt Crosby Bitcoin price not soaring despite institutional billions? Uncover why profit-taking and derivatives hold it back, with a breakout looming! ETF inflows and institutional purchases continue to climb, yet many investors are puzzled by the muted Bitcoin price action. With billions flowing into BTC, why aren’t we seeing the price explode to new highs? The reality is more nuanced than it first appears. Looking at the ETF cumulative inflows chart (excluding GBTC outflows), it’s clear that demand from institutional players has been robust. Since the most recent pullback in late March, net ETF inflows have climbed from roughly 527,000 BTC to over 630,000 BTC, an increase of around 100,000 BTC in under 3 months. These are significant numbers, yet the Bitcoin price has largely mainly drifted sideways since the start of 2025. It’s important to remember that not all ETF flows represent “institutional” buying in the purest sense. Many ETF purchases come from client allocations, for example, family offices or high-net-worth individuals using platforms like BlackRock. Still, these flows matter, and the steady accumulation is a positive driver for long-term supply and demand dynamics. Complementing ETF inflows, corporate treasury buying has also been strong, with (Micro)Strategy leading the charge. MSTR alone have seen their holdings have jumped from roughly 528,000 BTC to over 592,000 BTC in this year alone. Across all treasury companies tracked, total holdings now exceed 823,000 BTC, representing an astounding $86 billion in value. Despite this, many market participants feel underwhelmed by price action compared to prior cycles. But we must contextualize expectations: the BTC market cap is now in the multi-trillion-dollar range. The sheer scale of capital required to drive exponential moves today dwarfs previous cycles. Comparing this cycle to the 10x returns of earlier eras isn’t realistic. In truth, BTC has more than doubled from $40K at the time of ETF launch to recent levels above $110K, a still monumental achievement for a maturing asset class. To understand why Bitcoin prices haven’t surged even further, we must examine selling behavior. By analyzing HODL Waves data for 1-5 year bands, we can quantify long-term holder profit-taking. Over the past three months, more than 240,000 BTC from these older bands has been distributed to the market, nearly a quarter-million BTC in net outflows. This selling has largely counterbalanced institutional accumulation. Given that daily miner issuance still adds another ~450 BTC to the market, we see why price has struggled to break higher: the market is in a state of supply-demand equilibrium. Meanwhile, open interest on BTC derivatives markets has exploded. From under $5B less than 3 years ago to over $25B today. Many new participants prefer are opting to trade “paper BTC” on derivatives rather than buying spot BTC, which reduces the positive influence on price of increased market participants. There is however now reason for optimism. Long-term holder selling is now decelerating, with recent net outflows falling below 1,000 BTC per day, a substantial reduction from previous monthly averages just weeks ago. If institutional inflows remain steady and retail demand starts to awaken, even at levels seen earlier this cycle rather than extreme prior peaks, we could easily see another powerful leg higher. Past instances show that when retail flows surge from these levels, BTC can double in price within months. ETF inflows and treasury purchases are pouring billions of dollars into Bitcoin, but the muted Bitcoin price reaction makes perfect sense when viewed through the lens of supply and demand. Heavy profit-taking by long-term holders and growing derivatives speculation have balanced out the inflows. As long-term selling subsides and institutional buying continues, the stage is being set for the next bullish impulse. Whether we see the euphoric retail mania of prior cycles remains to be seen, but even modest retail inflows combined with current institutional demand could drive prices sharply higher sooner rather than later.

Title: Fidelity snaps up 1% of all Bitcoin as institutional buying surges

Fidelity outpaces BlackRock in ETF inflows, but broader BTC demand slump limits upside momentum. U.S. spot Bitcoin [BTC] ETF (exchange-traded funds) are back with a bang, posting the second daily inflow of $601.94 million on the 3rd of July. However, the Fidelity BTC ETF fund (FBTC) has recently seen more aggressive demand than BlackRock’s IBIT. In fact, at press time, FBTC led inflows with $237.13 million, compared to IBIT’s $224.53 million, SoSo data showed. On the 2nd of July, FBTC also dominated the BTC ETFs, attracting $183 million of the overall $408 million inflows seen on that trading day. Source: SoSo Value Since Q2, the sustained inflows into FBTC have increased its holdings to 199,493 BTC as of 4th of July. This translates to $22 billion worth of net assets per current prices and 1.02% of the total BTC supply of 21 million coins. Fidelity’s BTC ETF growth is part of a broader surge in institutional accumulation from Q2. Notably, ETFs scooped 111,411 BTC in Q2, increasing their overall BTC stash by 8%. But public corporate treasuries, led by Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), bought more BTC (131K BTC) and grew their BTC stash by 18%. On the ETF side, Fidelity was second only to BlackRock’s IBIT in terms of total BTC holdings. IBIT had 692,887 BTC or 3.3% of the total BTC supply, as of the 4th of July. However, according to Fintel data compiled by AMBCrypto, IBIT saw higher institutional holder growth of 9% compared to FBTC’s 2.6% in early Q3. It meant more major institutional players like hedge funds and endowments piled on BlackRock than Fidelity. Source: Fintel However, overall share-holdings and capital allocation were down in early Q3, suggesting a trimmed position likely linked to recent quarter-end rebalancing or diversification. That said, the strong demand from ETFs and public treasuries has not managed to juice up the broader spot market demand. According to CryptoQuant, the apparent demand has dropped to 857K BTC despite ETFs and Strategy buying 748K BTC. Per the analytics firm, the broader contraction could cap BTC upside in the short term. “ETFs and MSTR purchases are a portion of Bitcoin demand; overall demand contraction is more than offsetting these purchases, and the acceleration of overall demand growth is what drives price rallies.” Source: CryptoQuant As a result, CryptoQuant stated that although ETFs and Strategy’s buys were positive, they ‘are not sufficient to drive prices to fresh all-time highs.’ The asset was valued at $108.8K, at press time, after tagging $110.5k on the 3rd of July.

Title: European ESG rebrand challenges NZ ethical investing norms – Fran O’Sullivan

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. European stock exchanges are redefining ESG to include defence under "energy, security and geostrategy". Photo / Getty Images THE FACTS New Zealand company directors take note: European stock exchanges have kicked the traditional definition of ESG investing to the curb, rebranding it as “energy, security and geostrategy”. That’s the upshot of the determined political push under way to boost European defence companies and reduce Nato’s reliance on US armaments after the Trump administration savaged the region for not spending enough on its own security. In truth, the Europeans have had their collective ass handed to them by Donald Trump. The US President has strong-armed Nato members into increasing their defence budgets to 5% of GDP. However, the Europeans are determined their increased expenditure should boost their own defence companies – not simply be used to buy American military hardware and boost the profits of those American companies contributing to the US war machine. Back here, New Zealand companies have devoted thousands of pages in successive annual reports to trumpeting their prowess on environmental, social and governance metrics (traditional ESG). Some are required by law. Some frankly fall into “feel-good” box-ticking (often notable among failing companies!) and a deflection from a company’s true commercial driver, which is to post a profit and stay in business. It is time for a rethink. As with DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) policies, which even BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink (a previous champion) has walked away from, there is a sharpening of focus. At the Amsterdam Stock Exchange last week, chief executive René van Vlerken was quick to emphasise that the heightened geopolitical risks – obvious on Europe’s backdoor where the Russian-Ukraine conflict verges on a “forever war” – has made for the more existential approach. The Amsterdam exchange is part of the pan-European stock exchange Euronext, which operates regulated exchanges in Belgium, France, Ireland, Italy, Norway, and Portugal as well as the Netherlands. In May, Euronext’s chief executive and chairman Stephane Boujnah said the redefinition of ESG was in response to a “new geopolitical order”. “European aerospace and defence companies have expressed the urgent need to invest heavily in their innovation and production capacities to guarantee Europe’s strategic autonomy for the next decade,” Boujnah said. Euronext said it would revisit the methodologies for ESG indexes to limit the exclusions currently placed on defence companies. This poses a challenge for traditional ESG ratings agencies when it comes to advertising investments in defence industry-related bonds (for instance). It also has ramifications for entities like the New Zealand Super Fund and KiwiSaver funds, which walk a tightrope on definitions of ethical investing, with all sorts of activists getting exercised over where the funds invest. How will funds approach investing in New Zealand companies ranging from aerospace to quantum computing or drone manufacturing – all within the scope of the Government’s new defence plans – when there is a clear implication their products will be used in armed conflict? Euronext has said it will encourage the rating agencies to restrict the concept of controversial weapons solely to armament activities prohibited by relevant international treaties. What’s at stake is not small bikkies. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen believes the EU could mobilise up to €800 billion ($1.55 trillion) to strengthen its defence industry. There are also opportunities for Kiwi companies like Dawn Aerospace, with its dual base in the Netherlands and New Zealand. I was in the Netherlands with 40 business leaders on the New Zealand Initiative think tank’s Go Dutch study tour, which was designed to provide insights from small, advanced economies. Fortuitously, our time in the Netherlands coincided with the Nato Summit in the Hague. It also coincided with the US attack on three nuclear facilities in Iran with “bunker buster” bombs and Tomahawk missiles, which made for frantic rebooking of flights back to New Zealand after some airlines pulled back from flying over the Middle East. Trump did attend Nato, being hosted overnight by the Dutch King and Queen in their personal palace before a truncated Nato meeting. At the summit, the allies made a commitment to investing 5% of GDP annually on core defence requirements and defence and security-related spending by 2035. At least 3.5% of GDP was to fit within agreed definitions of Nato defence expenditure to resource core defence requirements and to meet Nato’s Capability Targets. The other 1.5% was to be invested in protecting critical infrastructure; defending networks; ensuring civil preparedness, resilience and innovation; and strengthening the defence industrial base. Prime Minister Christopher Luxon was also in the Netherlands. He was the only political leader from the Indo-Pacific Four – Japan, Australia, South Korea and New Zealand – to attend the Nato Summit. It was noted that he had turned up. Luxon contends he was under no pressure to increase New Zealand’s defence spending above the targeted 2% of GDP within the decade that was outlined in the recent Budget. But this is a more dangerous world. It was notable that when we visited Rotterdam – which hosts Europe’s largest port and some fully-automated container terminals – that the Dutch Ministry of Defence wants to acquire terminal capacity for handling multiple ships carrying military cargo (mainly equipment and ammunition) simultaneously. It has been agreed within Nato that this type of cargo can be transported via the Netherlands, even if the destination is outside the Netherlands. In the Netherlands, where older Dutch people still hold sharply to the lessons from the Nazi occupation in World War II – and where they have more recently been hurt by soaring energy prices sparked by the withdrawal of Russian gas flowing to Europe via Ukraine – there is a quiet confidence. With 26% of land under sea level, the Netherlands has developed extensive water management systems, including dikes, dams and polders (land reclaimed from the sea) to manage the obvious risk. There is a frank realism there – we could do with a bit more here. Disclaimer: Fran O’Sullivan met her own costs to take part in the New Zealand Initiative’s Go Dutch study tour. These are her views.

Skip to comments. Posted on 07/04/2025 12:30:55 PM PDT by thegagline The Trump administration plans to implement a process whereby farmers in Iowa can vouch for hard-working, law-abiding migrant farmworkers who may be facing deportation, so that they can remain in the U.S. The proposed process was shared by President Donald Trump during an event at the Iowa State Fairgrounds on Thursday night, kicking off a year of patriotic celebrations meant to honor the nation’s 250th birthday. Trump said the new plan will take place in coordination with the Department of Homeland Security and that legislation for the measure is currently being drafted while speaking Thursday evening from Iowa. “You know, they’ve had people working for them for years. And we’re going to do something … we’re going to sort of put the farmers in charge,” Trump told the crowd of people in attendance. “If a farmer has been with one of these people that worked so hard – they bend over all day, we don’t have too many people that can do that, but they work very hard, and they know him very well, and some of the farmers are literally, you know, they cry when they see this happen – if a farmer is willing to vouch for these people, in some way, Kristie, I think we’re going to have to just say that’s going to be good, right?” “We don’t want to do [border security] where we take all of the workers off the farms,” Trump added. “We want the farms to do great.” (Excerpt) Read more at nypost.com ...

Blackrock and liberals have been buying up farmland. Think they would fib to a feller? Remember there is a reason birthright citizenship needs to terminated if both of the parents are not American. “Yet it makes sense and President Trump is proposing it.” I guess it doesn’t bother you that China has been acquiring farmland in the USA for at least a decade? Good grief! A Democrat is NOT proposing that, and I’m crying, “traitor!” We did NOT vote for Trump go go all squishy on us six months into his term. Wonders if Trump has fully thought this through. Fraud and dishonesty is not exactly unheard of in this country right about now. “...they bend over all day, we don’t have too many people that can do that...” We can do that one day a year.....April 15th. I’m not a fan of this. Blackrock and liberals have been buying up farmland. Think they would fib to a feller? sponsorship means more to me than lip service. It means some skin in the game by all parties. one on the things in that agreement is no free stuff from the govt. a financial deposit and I am sure there are others. OH, Close enforcement of the agreement. How can Trump get away with amnesty just for farm workers? Sounds good to me. Every successful economy in history imports foreign workers. Some level of foreign workers are helpful, too many are harmful. We just need to find the correct balance of foreign workers. Awful, awful, awful! GOP at its worst. He needs to hear from us loud and clear! This is wrong, and we will have liberals accept large numbers this way. The law was and is broken. It’s a ridiculous - and frankly offensive - plan. If farmers can vouch for farmworkers, why can’t roofing companies vouch for roofers? And landscaping companies for landscapers? And, etc. If they’re so critical, put them under the farm workers visa program. All illegals should get the boot. Too many loopholes that will be exploited. Yeah, sure.

Title: Nvidia becomes most valuable company ever at $3.92T, leaving Microsoft and Apple behind

The surge of Nvidia's market value is fueled by the AI race, as lot of companies are fighting over a share of the AI reserves, Nvidia is simply supplying weapons to all sides of the war. Though Nvidia has many AI models of its own, it isn't targeting endpoint consumers or making chatbots for everyday use. One of Nvidia's models, Nemotron‑4 (340B), is used to generate synthetic data used for training LLMs. Thanks to the increasing competition among tech giants to build the most advanced AI data centers, train cutting-edge models, and dominate the sector, Nvidia is cashing in. It supplies most of the chips used for these purposes. Just 2 weeks ago, Nvidia became the most valuable publicly traded company, with a market cap of $3.34 trillion. Hitting this new all-time high represents a ~17.4% growth from the $3.34 trillion market value we reported about 2 weeks ago. Unless the AI race slows down, Team Green is likely to keep seeing green. Fun fact: The world’s largest asset management firm, BlackRock, manages over $11.5 trillion in assets but has a market value of about $182.6 billion. CompaniesMarketCap.com

All portfolio trades were executed with global reinsurance companies and top-tier Lloyd's of London syndicates, and were sourced through the top three global reinsurance brokers. MCM Fund I opens access to reinsurance income for a rapidly expanding capital base of new investors seeking diversified and uncorrelated investment alternatives with attractive yield and structured liquidity. The launch represents the growing importance of funds structuring their offerings to take advantage of the continuing convergence between traditional finance and digital assets. Backed by Solana, Aptos, and Cardano and supported by institutions like Coinbase, Archax, Apex Group, and Envelop Risk, MembersCap has selected the Solana, Aptos, Cardano, and Base protocols to provide access to qualified investors wishing to invest using eligible cryptocurrencies. MembersCap has been selected as the first fund in the real-world assets category on the Archax platform, sitting alongside tokenized offerings from other institutions like BlackRock, State Street, and Aberdeen. The reinsurance opportunity Being fundamentally uncorrelated with the financial markets, reinsurance has consistently outperformed most traditional alternatives over the past two decades. Despite being highly yield-generative, the sector has historically been reserved for pension plans, sovereign wealth funds, and other institutional giants. Increasingly, both crypto-native investors and smaller traditional allocators are seeking refuge from market volatility by accessing reinsurance as a stable, diversified income stream to support a balanced portfolio and enhance overall returns. "Every generation is presented with new technologies that unlock economic opportunity. To us, tokenisation and the blockchain represent access to better asset management for a different class of investor," said Lloyd Wahed, Co-Founder and CEO of MembersCap. "We're excited to be one of the first institutional funds to emerge from this space." "Our investors– digital asset institutions, family offices, HNWIs —want to meet their goals of resiliency and long-term sustainable growth through new and more efficient means. With this novel approach, we're seeing these investors view reinsurance as a core part of their portfolio for the first time," said Patrick Barrett, Co-Founder and COO at MembersCap. "This launch proves that tokenisation can bring new capital to help address the growing insurance protection gap by lowering barriers and providing access to the private reinsurance market," said Dr. Benjamin Fox, Co-Founder and Chief Investment Officer at MembersCap. "Our tokenised model enables a new cohort of investors to participate pari passu alongside large institutions in an uncorrelated asset class with a track record of reliable, attractive returns." Positioned as an alternative to private equity, venture capital, and fixed income strategies, MCM Fund I provides qualified investors with regulated and collateralised access to reinsurance via direct exposure to natural catastrophe and cyber reinsurance contracts sourced through blue-chip global partners. For Web3 treasuries, foundations, and institutions, the Fund delivers high-yield opportunities and structured liquidity, derived from high-quality, real-world reinsurance returns, without exposure to DeFi volatility and over-concentration in altcoins. MembersCap was founded in 2024 and is backed by a strong coalition of both institutional and blockchain-native partners. This blend of traditional underwriting expertise and on-chain architecture ensures institutional-grade standards while embracing next-generation accessibility. About Members Capital ManagementFounded in 2024, Members Capital Management ("MembersCap") is a licensed investment manager regulated by the Bermuda Monetary Authority, bridging institutional finance and blockchain infrastructure. Backed by leading blockchain protocols including Cardano, Aptos, and Solana, and supported by institutional infrastructure from Archax, Coinbase, Apex Group and Envelop Risk, MembersCap delivers a new institutional blueprint: tokenised participation to the global reinsurance market, an asset class traditionally closed to most investors.

Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily It is the latest decision in favor of the Sandro and Maje parent company. PARIS — SMCP will get its shares back. The Singapore High Court has ruled that Dynamic Treasure Group must return the 15.5 percent stake it holds to European TopSoho, the parent company of SMCP, which had been transferred illegally. The court ordered that Dynamic Treasure Group has one week to return the shares, or appeal the decision. In a statement, the company said it will “keep the market informed about the effective completion of the return of this stake.” Related Articles Celebrity News Princess Beatrice Brings Understated Flair in Striped Sandro Look to First Day of Wimbledon 2025 Financial SMCP Sales Gain 2.6% in Q1 Amid Strategic Shift Away From China This is the latest twist and turn in a case stemming from 2021, when 15.5 percent of the share capital of Sandro, Maje and Claudie Pierlot parent company SMCP “disappeared” from France and reappeared in the British Virgin Islands two-and-a-half months later. You May Also Like This follows a similar decision by the English High Court in July 2024, which canceled the sale of the shares to Dynamic Treasure Group. It’s also the second ruling in the case within a month as it winds through courts and regulators in multiple jurisdictions. In June, French regulatory body Autorieté des Marchés Financiers fined the company and its shareholders for a series of irregularities. First, the regulatory body sanctioned former majority shareholder European TopSoho, director of European TopSoho Chenran Qiu and Dynamic Treasure Group, which received the shares, for disclosure violations and market manipulation. The shares were moved from Luxembourg to the British Virgin Islands without notifying the authorities. They effectively “went missing” until they reappeared in the accounts of Dynamic Treasure Group, also controlled by Qiu, weeks later. European TopSoho had sold them to DTG for a symbolic one-euro price. In the interim, European TopSoho also issued a press release denying Qiu was involved in Dynamic Treasure Group, misleading the market. As a result, the AMF issued a series of fines. Qiu was sanctioned with 1 million euros, European TopSoho 400,000 euros, and Dynamic Treasure Group 300,000 for a total of 1.7 million euros. Separately, the AMF fined SMCP 20,000 euros for an unrelated leak of their financial information in 2021, when it accidentally published quarterly results on its website before market close. The London-based GLAS is the trustee for European TopSoho creditors including BlackRock, Carlyle, Anchorage, Boussard and Gavaudan that united to save the group with the issuance of bonds, and effectively SMCP’s largest shareholder. They announced last year their intention to offload 37 percent of the group’s shares. That move could trigger a mandatory takeover action under French law if a single purchaser snaps them up. SMCP has been on the road to recovery as it seeks to replace the market share it lost in China by expanding into new regions in Asia, including the Philippines, Indonesia and India. It recruited former Loewe executive Kleine Tan to take up the role of chief executive officer of SMCP Asia in April, tasked with implementing the company’s “strategic road map in the region, notably our network optimization in China,” she said in a statement shared first with WWD at the time.

Title: World of Warcraft: What’s Up With the Collector’s Bounty?
URL: https://kotaku.com/world-of-warcraft-collectors-bounty-july-legacy-content-1851785640
Time Published: 2025-07-04T15:00:00Z
Full Content:
As part of the run-up to patch 11.2, Blizzard is closing out Season 2 of World of Warcraft: The War Within with a couple of special events. One of them is a buff called Collector’s Bounty which is aimed at transmog collectors and mount farmers. Here’s what you might want to know before you jump in. There’s been some confusion about how Collector’s Bounty works. It was implemented on July 1 after the weekly reset, but took a couple of hours to kick in. Its effects were initially invisible. Now every character who logs into a modern TWW server will receive Collector’s Bounty on entry into the world. While this buff persists, bosses in every dungeon and raid instance in “legacy content” (any expansion before Dragonflight), drops double the normal loot. In dungeons, this typically means four to six items, while raid bosses can drop up to 12 depending on the raid’s difficulty setting. Anecdotally, it also seems as if dungeon monsters have a greater chance to drop green- and blue-quality items. This is a great opportunity to hunt down any transmogrification items you’ve been missing. (Personally, I use the AllTheThings add-on to track my collection, which is why my tooltips are slightly longer than usual). Further, several specific items, such as rare mounts and legendary weapons, have a +5 percent chance to drop during Collector’s Bounty. This is 10 times their usual drop rate, and some obsessed players have been trying to get them for actual calendar years. Maybe now’s their chance. Specific items affected by Collector’s Bounty include: Note: While not specifically affected by Collector’s Bounty, SoO has a few secret transmogrification items as boss drops, such as the Kor’kron Dark Shaman set and Mannoroth’s Tusks, that should be easier to farm now. In addition, keep an eye out for two high-demand cosmetic weapon drops from Antorus. Aggramar’s flaming sword Taeshalach has been a popular transmogrification option since Legion came out, and Argus has a low chance to drop his scythe. While anyone in Champion-track TWW gear or better should blast through most BfA content like it isn’t there, this is also where raid encounter design can get a bit tricky. For example, the Stormwall Blockade encounter in Dazar’lor has an instant kill built into it if you don’t interrupt Catastrophic Tides in time. (If you’re a warlock, make sure your felhunter is out.) The entrance to Ny’alotha can appear in either Uldum or the Vale of Eternal Blossoms depending on where the Black Empire is attacking in a given week. You can solo N’Zoth these days without the old BfA legendary cloak, but at current TWW gear levels, you cannot simply burst N’Zoth hard enough to ignore his central mechanics. You’ll need to enter his Mindgates and reclaim your Severed Consciousness or you’ll simply drop dead. While there are a couple of ways to reach various parts of the Shadowlands without having to go through its introductory sequence, you’ll typically end up out of phase with most of the features and characters. To get into places like the Maw or Zereth Mortis on a new character, you’ll need to start their introductory quests by talking to the Knights of Ebon Blade in either Stormwind or Orgrimmar. Like BfA, there are a few different bosses in Shadowlands with instant-kill gimmicks, particularly in mythic raids. While none of them have the firepower to really bother a level 80 character, given the stat inflation between this expansion and TWW, a few have abilities that can seriously ruin a solo raider’s day. Particular offenders here include the Jailer’s mind control, Soulrender Dormazain’s Warmonger Shackles, and Artificer Xy’mox’s Stasis Traps. Keep an eye on your dungeon journal. At time of writing, So’leah is also difficult to beat solo, as her dungeon gimmick gives her a massive damage reduction bonus that you can’t dispel without a team. You can either autoattack her for 10 minutes, bring friends, or use a level 80 monk’s Touch of Death to bypass her shields and drop her in one hit. Collector’s Bounty in World of Warcraft is currently planned to last until July 28. .

Friday, July 4th, 2025 Trading activity was thin towards the end of this week as the United States celebrates Independence Day – with a record-breaking 72 million people traveling – but both ICE Brent and WTI edged slightly lower on expectations of OPEC+ hiking production targets again in August. Whilst OPEC+’s Saturday meeting seems to be a rather predictable affair, next week’s big price moves will be dictated by the July 9 tariff deadline as Asian countries try their luck with last-minute negotiations with President Trump. OPEC+ Moves Its July Meeting a Day Ahead. Sticking to its policy of trying to surprise market watchers, the group of eight OPEC+ producers unwinding production cuts decided to move their meeting initially planned for July 6 to Saturday, in anticipation of yet another 411,000 b/d monthly output hike. Trading Giant Tries Its Luck with Last-Minute Bid. A consortium led by privately-held trading giant Vitol submitted an eleventh-hour bid for Venezuela-owned US refiner Citgo Petroleum, offering more than 10 billion for Citgo’s 807,000 b/d capacity for three refineries, the highest known offer in the ongoing auction. India Wants to Expand Strategic Reserves. The government of India has started feasibility studies on the construction of three new strategic petroleum storage sites, more than doubling the current 40-million-barrel SPR stock, placing a special emphasis on salt caverns in the northern state of Rajasthan. Exxon Returns Unused Guyana Acreage to State. US oil major ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) has returned 2,534 km2 (equivalent to 978 sq miles) of the Stabroek block offshore Guyana to the South American country’s government, relinquishing it after it didn’t manage to explore or develop those territories. BlackRock Comes to the Rescue. With Saudi Arabia expected to take on more debt this year after a $15.6 billion deficit in Q1, US investment firm BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) has reportedly expressed interest in selling its stake in Saudi Aramco’s (TADAWUL:2222) natural gas pipeline network back to the NOC. China Eases Taxation on Embattled Teapots. The regional government of Shandong hiked fuel oil import tax rebates for independent refiners in the region, returning between 75% and 95% of payable consumption tax for gasoline and diesel as most ‘teapots’ barely survive at 50-55% utilization rates. Brazil Eyes More Exploration Money. Following a bumper revenue stream of 180 million from Brazil’s 5th Concession Offer bidding last month, the Latin American country now wants to hold an additional E&P auction to be organized in 2025 still for uncontracted pre-salt areas, eyeing higher budget revenue. Glencore Mulls Its Options with UK Refinery. Swiss-based global trading house Glencore (LON:GLEN) has been in talks with the UK government over the fate of the 113,000 b/d Lindsey refinery, caught in great turmoil after the insolvency of its operator Prax, as Glencore has been its exclusive crude supplier. Sanctions-Hit Venezuela Revisits China Dependence. Despite the Trump administration’s sanctions snapback on Venezuela, PDVSA’s exports of oil and refined products edged slightly higher in June to 844,000 b/d, however almost 90% of all flows are now moving towards China, a longtime ally. US Oil Drilling Wanes on Uncertain Outlook. According to the latest survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, oil and gas business activity in the US turned negative in Q2 2025 as the uncertainty index soared to 47.1, with almost half of companies expecting to drill fewer wells this year than initially expected. Japan Wants Fully-Fledged Carbon Trading by 2027. Japan launched discussions with domestic industry participants to kick-start its full-scale emissions trading system by 2027, mandating that all companies emitting more than 100,000 metric tonnes of CO2 participate in ETS trading, a step up from the current voluntary market. Ecuador Declares Force Majeure on Oil Production. Ecuador’s state oil company Petroecuador declared force majeure on all its operations after the 360,000 b/d SOTE and 450,000 b/d OCP pipelines carrying crude from the country’s inner regions to the coast were damaged by landslides and erosion. Trump Admin Lifts Restrictions on China-Bound Ethane. The US Commerce Department rescinded its mandate for US ethane exporters to seek export licenses for deliveries to China, with both Enterprise and Energy Transfer confirming flows from the Morgan’s Point and Nederland terminals have fully resumed.

Title: Is Elon Musk Really Behind the Bitcoin Buzz This Time?

Time Published: 2025-07-04T13:56:08Z
Full Content:
The cryptocurrency market is no stranger to volatility induced by Elon Musk. His tweets have historically caused major price swings. But as BTC flirts with fresh highs, the current rally is more data-driven—and the Tesla CEO’s role remains unconfirmed. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, has achieved a historic milestone by closing the second quarter at its highest level ever, reaching $107,149 on the Bitstamp exchange. This performance follows an 11.6% decline in the first quarter, but Bitcoin rebounded with a 30% gain in the second quarter. Social metrics from LunarCrush and Santiment show a spike in Bitcoin-related engagement following a cryptic tweet from Musk on June 29. The post included a rocket emoji and a dollar symbol—enough to prompt a flurry of interpretations from the crypto community. However, no direct reference to Bitcoin was made. Analysts at CryptoQuant and Kaiko note that while social sentiment surged after the tweet, no significant wallet activity linked to Musk or Tesla has been reported. Bloomberg estimates that BlackRock IBIT brings in roughly $187.2 million annually through its 0.25% management fee. By comparison, IVV, which tracks the S&P 500 and has been a staple in retail and institutional portfolios for years, charges just 0.03%. Glassnode reports that Bitcoin’s 14-day RSI remains under 60, suggesting there’s room for more momentum. Price is holding above its 50-day ($105,970) and 200-day ($87,717) moving averages. Meanwhile, whale activity appears mixed. IntoTheBlock data shows a 45% drop in large BTC transactions over the past month, suggesting some cooling among high-net-worth traders. Still, BTC’s technical posture remains bullish. The network’s health and rising ETF demand suggest fundamental strength rather than hype-driven movement. While Elon Musk’s influence on the market remains a wildcard, current data suggests that his actions do not primarily drive Bitcoin’s momentum.

DeFi Technologies Inc. (the “Company” or “DeFi Technologies”) (Nasdaq: DEFT) (CBOE CA: DEFI) (GR: R9B), a financial technology company bridging the gap between traditional capital markets and decentralized finance (“DeFi”), has announced its expansion in the GCC and MENA region with the registration of DEFI DMCC (certification no DMCC199558) with offices in Jumeirah Lake Towers Dubai UAE. 0 04 July 2025 Be the first to comment This content is provided by an external author without editing by Finextra. It expresses the views and opinions of the author. DeFi Technologies through its subsidiary Valour, and Valour Digital Securities Limited (and, together with Valour Inc., “Valour”) a leading issuer of exchange-traded products (“ETPs”) has also opened a trading desk at DMCC (Dubai Multi Commodities Center) in UAE. The DeFi Technologies team and its subsidiary Valour, aim to support the increased institutional interest in digital assets in the GCC region and specifically in the UAE. This expansion into the Middle East is a key element of the strategy to increase product offerings and global footprint. As the first Nasdaq-listed digital asset manager of its kind, DeFi Technologies offers equity investors diversified exposure to the broader decentralized economy through its integrated and scalable business model. This includes Valour, which offers access to more than 65 of the world’s most innovative digital assets via regulated ETPs with plans to offer 100 by the end of 2025. With regulatory momentum, product velocity, and institutional credibility converging, DEFT is positioning itself as the BlackRock of Web3. Globally, institutional capital is pouring into spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and in the Middle East and in the UAE in specific this is also becoming a trend. Recently, UAE sovereign wealth fund Mubadala announced it expanded its position in BlackRock’s bitcoin ETF showcasing the latest example of institutions increasingly turning to non-traditional exposures wrapped in an ETF. Bitcoin ETPs are facilitating greater exposure for investors who had been interested in crypto but want a familiar and efficient wrapper. Currently, total assets under management (“AUM”) in crypto ETPs have reached $176.3 billion. Andrew Forson, President of DeFi Technologies and Chief Growth Officer of Valour, stated, “ We believe the demand for digital asset ETPs will increase not only globally but in the GCC and Middle East. Investors whether sovereign wealth funds, institutional investors, family offices and even retail investors are interested in crypto but require familiar and efficient vehicles to get exposure.” He adds, “Wrapping digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum in regulated financial instruments such as ETPs will increase the number of crypto investors and offer countries such as the UAE, Qatar, Oman, and Saudi Arabia access to international foreign investment. Local and international get exposure to these assets through trusted providers like the Abu Dhabi Stock Exchange, Dubai Financial Markets, and others.” Already DeFi Technologies has expanded into Turkey through a collaboration with Misyon Bank, and Misyon Kripto to work to introduce ETPs. In Turkey currently over 50% of investor population are holding digital assets. In 2024, DeFi Technologies through its subsidiary Valour partnered with GulfCap Investment Bank (“GCIB”), a licensed investment bank as its key Transaction Advisor for the proposed cross-listing of Valour’s ETPs on the Nairobi Securities Exchange (“NSE”) in Kenya. The proposed cross-listing will allow Valour’s ETPs to be traded in Kenyan Shillings on the NSE and provide investors in East Africa with exposure to leading digital assets through regulated investment vehicles. In Europe DeFi Technologies subsidiary Valour currently offers 65+ fully hedged digital asset ETPs on leading European exchanges including Xetra, Spotlight, and Euronext.

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. Bitcoin has surged toward its all-time high in recent weeks, adding around 50% since dropping to its April lows as crypto changes the game for Elon Musk’s SpaceX and ChatGPT maker OpenAI. Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price, which is braced for a “big” month ahead after the White House crypto czar teased a major update, has climbed to give bitcoin a total market capitalization of more than $2 trillion, with bullish traders predicting a looming bitcoin price boom. Now, as traders eye “trillions and trillions” of dollars that remain on the sidelines, bitcoin and crypto-backing senator Senator Cynthia Lummis has introduced a bill to Congress she described as “groundbreaking.” Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run U.S. president Donald Trump has declared himself the first "crypto president," helping the bitcoin ... More price soar. “This groundbreaking legislation is fully paid for, cuts through the bureaucratic red tape and establishes common-sense rules that reflect how digital technologies function in the real world,” Lummis said in a statement. The bill would see small crypto transactions of less than $300 exempt from taxes, as well as crypto lending, and defer taxes on income generated from crypto mining and staking until the coins are sold. It would also apply a typical 30-day wash rule to crypto, removing a loophole that has allowed crypto investors to sell at a loss only to buy back in again while still claiming a tax deduction. Lummis highlighted estimates from the congressional joint committee on taxation that estimated the bill would generate about $600 million through 2034. “We cannot allow our archaic tax policies to stifle American innovation, and my legislation ensures Americans can participate in the digital economy without inadvertent tax violations,” Lummis said. Lummis had tried to squeeze the crypto tax reforms into U.S. president Donald Trump’s so-called "one, big, beautiful" bill but ran out of time before the Senate sent it to the House. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has rocketed higher over the last year, propelled by U.S. president Donald Trump's ... More return to the White House. Trump’s "one, big, beautiful bill," designed to overhaul the U.S. tax-and-spend landscape and power the country’s next phase of growth while adding an expected $3 trillion of debt and raising the debt ceiling by $5 trillion, has been passed by the House of Representatives. House Republicans have meanwhile declared the week beginning July 14 "crypto week," in which policymakers will focus on three major crypto bills—the stablecoin Genius Act, the market structure Clarity Act and the Anti-CBDC [central bank digital currency] Surveillance State Act. The Trump administration’s pro-bitcoin and crypto agenda has been named as a catalyst for a bitcoin price break out in coming months. “We expect bitcoin to print new all-time highs in the second half of the year, buoyed by growing ETF [exchange-traded fund] and corporate treasury flows, as well as U.S. policy and regulatory developments,” Geoff Kendrick, global head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered Bank, said in an emailed note. Spot bitcoin ETFs, led by the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock, as well as so-called bitcoin treasury companies that have sprung up in the wake of Michael Saylor’s bitcoin-buying giant Strategy, have hoovered up more than $100 billion worth of bitcoin between them in the last few years.

Photo: Adrian Murrell/Getty Images Limerick rugby has always been different. For generations rugby was a middle-class, if not upper-class, pursuit, in Ireland. The vast majority of the rugby playing population began their careers in the most prestigious fee-paying schools in Ireland, like Clongowes and Blackrock College. This point was reflected in Brendan Behan’s observation: “I never heard rugby was a proper game for anyone except bank clerks. It was a game for the Protestant and the shop-keeping Catholic and I never thought it had anything to do with me.”

Title: Best golf courses in Co Louth: Bucket list courses and hidden gems from Baltray to Ardee

The drive from Drogheda along the River Boyne to the village of Baltray is one which heightens expectations of what awaits at the mouth of the river. County Louth Golf Club – a fine, traditional links – has earned its place among the top courses in the country. Originally designed in the 1890s by a Scottish professional with the wonderful name of Mr Snowball, the man most responsible for leaving his imprint on this seaside course – where Shane Lowry won the Irish Open as an amateur in 2009 – was the noted golf course architect Tom Simpson and his assistant Molly Gourlay. [ Fairways to Heaven - Ireland's Ultimate Golf GuideOpens in new window ] The links itself is a true test from start-to-finish, as it weaves its way in different directions but still consists of two loops. The most dramatic run of holes comes on the back nine, with the run from the 10th to 13th comprising arguably the best sequence of four successive par-fours anywhere. The 14th is the shortest of the par-fours but one of the best, playing from the elevated tee with the final destination of a green planted into the sand hills. In every sense, Baltray – the traditional home of the men’s East of Ireland championship – is a links that will reward and captivate, while being at all times challenging. Its clever design, utilising the terrain that is primarily flat before delving into the sand hills from the 12th to the 14th, entices and demands attention on every shot. As part of the bucket list, it is worth factoring in a round at the adjacent Seapoint links – designed by Des Smyth and Declan Branigan – which has matured wonderfully, especially the back nine which takes in views of the Irish Sea from a number of vantage points. The best is probably left to last at Seapoint. The 18th hole running along the coastline back to the clubhouse where the spirit of the 19th hole welcome is very much in play. Co Louth Golf Club, Baltray, Drogheda, Co Louth, A92 HK03; 041-9881530 Seapoint Golf Club, Termonfeckin, Co Louth; 041-9822333; email: ed@seapoint.ie Greenore is a long established course dating back to the 1890s but remains one of those hidden gems, primarily because its location on the Cooley peninsula overlooking Carlingford Lough ... but it is very much worth discovering as a fine test of golf in a wonderful setting with views across to the Mournes. Wind, given its location, is invariably a factor but the layout is open with the challenge set before the player off the tee with no hidden surprises. Although flat, the loughside course has its challenges with tidal water in play, most notably on the sixth and seventh holes. The tee to the Par 3 sixth is located on a disused railway line and plays downhill to the green, while it is followed by a demanding Par 4 with a tee shot over water. Greenore Golf Club, Greenore, Dundalk; 042-9373212 Dundalk Golf Club is a classic parkland course with a reputation for its wonderful greens. Located above the picturesque village of Blackrock, the treelined course has three distinct segments with an opening stretch of four tough Par 4s, then a stretch to the 12th that includes four Par 5s and a tough finishing run all the way to the 18th which is known as “Harrington’s Challenge,” in honour of three-time Major champion Pádraig Harrington who won the Dundalk Scratch Cup in 1995.

The stretch of holes from the 11th to the 14th is very demanding, with the short 13th that has water in play from tee to green showcasing the picturesque nature of the entire layout.

Title: What Wall Street’s rampaging run means for KiwiSaver investors - Stock Takes

Time Published: 2025-07-03T21:00:00Z

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. Wall Street's bull run has been a boon for KiwiSaver funds. Photo / File This week, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq hit record highs, boosted by gains in technology stocks and a trade agreement between the United States and Vietnam. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is only a fraction short of its record close on December 4. Meanwhile, a better-than-expected US jobs report for June reinforced expectations that the US Federal Reserve would not cut official interest rates this year. US stocks have more than made up for the tariff-driven selloff, so what will that mean for KiwiSaver investors, many of whom will have some kind of exposure to Wall Street? As at the end of March, investment research firm Morningstar tracked about $121 billion of assets in KiwiSaver, of which $49b was invested in international stock markets. “The MSCI World Index is about 72% US-based, so we would estimate that there would be around $35b invested in the US equity markets,” the firm told Stock Takes. That’s welcome news for KiwiSaver investors, given the New Zealand sharemarket has underperformed, reflecting the weak economy. Mark Lister, investment director at Craigs Investment Partners, said diversification had been a big plus. “The fact that KiwiSaver investors have a healthy allocation of US shares has been a very good thing in recent years because many investors - if they were making their own investment decisions - might have tilted towards the local market, which has been an underperformer. “The fact that KiwiSaver funds have been very internationally focused [and with the US being the world’s biggest share market] has ensured that KiwiSaver members and investors have had some very good returns in recent years.” Lister noted that, while the US market was at record highs, it had suffered a big fall in April on the back of US President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcement. The US market had recouped its losses, but the weaker US dollar offset some of those gains for Kiwis. Lister said international diversification in general had been a positive for KiwiSaver investors, not just because of Wall Street’s performance. He noted emerging markets had also been strong, along with Japan, Europe and the UK. “Europe, to me, is probably one of the standouts because the euro has also been strong. “For a New Zealand investor, you’ve got the double whammy of a strongly performing European market and a rising euro against the Kiwi dollar. “All in all, it hasn’t been too bad in the first six months of the year for investors, and it’s been that international exposure that will have helped them, despite the local share market and the housing market continuing to lag.” While US stock markets look to be in full recovery mode, somebody has forgotten the US dollar, which is having its worst start to the year since 1973. Trump’s trade and economic policies have prompted global investors to rethink their exposure to the US, but the greenback’s role as the world’s reserve currency looks to be safe. BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, paints an optimistic outlook for US equities, despite the uncertainties posed by Trump’s policies. “As US policy reclaims centre stage, we think immutable economic laws will limit extremes, while tax cuts and deregulation could boost investor sentiment,” BlackRock said in a commentary. US policy developments were coming thick and fast. “As the end of the 90-day tariff pause looms, we think immutable economic laws will prevent a return to a maximal stance. “We are also seeing movement in US policies that could boost investor sentiment, including tax cuts and regulatory reforms like a federal stablecoin framework. “These reforms will take time, but support our US equities overweight [position]. “We stay underweight long-term Treasuries on sticky inflation and deficit concerns.” Trump’s pause on sweeping tariffs expires on Wednesday. In New Zealand’s case, exporters face a 10% tariff on exports to the US. But analysts say the risk lies not so much with tariffs on New Zealand goods but the impact that they will have on world growth. Kiwibank chief economist Jarrod Kerr noted the US dollar’s weakness and the questions being asked about its reserve status. “My opinion is that we have not seen a dumping of the US dollar at all. “We have seen a diversification, perhaps, but certainly not a dumping. “Yields on US Treasuries are not rising in a concerning way - in fact, they have fallen (4.24% for US 10-years).” The weak US dollar is good news for Trump, who has long called for a lower greenback to make US manufacturers more competitive. “Trump is pretty sensitive to the financial markets, but having the dollar drop in the way that it has will not concern him at all,” Kerr said. While the New Zealand share market remained sidelined, the one bright spot seemed to be the agricultural sector. “My worry is that, if these tariffs come in, they will start to slow the world economy down, which is what many forecast. “That’s a worry because we are exposed to that slowdown. “And the best-performing sectors of the economy are the most exposed to the global slowdown.” A Malaysian company may be interested in buying Fletcher Building’s construction unit, according to a report in The Australian. The newspaper’s “Dataroom” said Malaysia’s Gamuda had expressed an interest in buying the Fletcher Building construction arm. Gamuda is an engineering, property and infrastructure group and is one of the largest in Malaysia’s infrastructure sector. Early last month, Fletcher Building told the NZX that it had received inquiries from parties interested in its businesses, including its construction division, after the company’s announcement of a strategic review. “The company advises that no decisions have been made to sell any of its businesses,” it said then. Tucked away in NZX-listed Burger Fuel’s annual report was a comment on the number of young people leaving for Australia. The chain said there had been a “significant” exodus of “home-grown, hardcore” Burger Fuel customers to Australia and other overseas destinations. “These younger Burger Fuel customers are not being replaced by incoming migrants, who are unlikely to purchase from Burger Fuel for some years,” the company said. Trading in 2025 had been “one of the toughest on record” for the hospitality industry, the report said. “Although there is talk of economic improvement, we have not seen this translate to sales; the economy remains in recession. “The slow reduction of interest rates and general economic uncertainty has led to consumers keeping their wallets in their pockets. “People are spending less and most certainly eating out less.” “We do not anticipate significant positive changes in the economic environment over the next 12 months,” chairman Alan Gourdie and chief executive Josef Roberts said.

Tokenization platform Ondo Finance ONDO$0.7957 and digital asset investment firm Pantera Capital have teamed up to invest $250 million in real-world asset (RWA) projects as the red-hot tokenization trend is accelerating. The initiative, named Ondo Catalyst, aims to invest in protocols and infrastructure projects that enhance the development of tokenized finance and on-chain capital markets, according to a Thursday blog post by Ondo. The initiative will do a mix of equity and token investments, a representative of Ondo told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. "The financial system is undergoing a fundamental upgrade," Nathan Allman, founder and CEO of Ondo Finance, said in the blog post. "By supporting the infrastructure and applications that unlock real-world utility for tokenized assets, we're helping reshape how capital moves around the world." Tokenization is one of the fastest-growing crypto use cases and has captivated big banks, fintechs, asset managers and crypto native firms alike. The process aims to bring traditional financial instruments such as bonds, stocks and real estate, often dubbed RWAs, onto blockchain rails, promising more efficient operations, faster and around-the-clock settlements, broader investor access and programmable transactions. For example, Robinhood, Bybit, Kraken and Gemini have recently introduced trading with tokenized versions of U.S. stocks, while BlackRock and Franklin Templeton issue tokenized money market funds backed by short-term U.S. Treasuries. Ondo is one of the largest tokenized U.S. Treasury issuers, with its OUSG and USDY tokens having a combined market capitalization of nearly $1.4 billion, data by RWA.xyz shows. The firm is also developing a layer-1 blockchain network designed for tokenized RWAs. The news of the partnership was first reported by Axios.

Title: Considering A Career Move Or Pension In Crypto? Crypto’s Overdue Respect
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/lawrencewintermeyer/2025/07/03/considering-a-career-move-or-pension-in-crypto-cryptos-overdue-respect/

ByLawrence Wintermeyer ByLawrence Wintermeyer, Contributor. Young stock trader shows executive managers cryptocurrency and market correlation on wall TV. It is estimated that over 55 million Americans use cryptocurrencies, 20% of the adult population. Europe has an estimated 31 million cryptocurrency users, 25% of the adult population, and in the U.K. its 12% of the of the adult population, or 4 million adults. Africa has 38 million users, Latin America has 55 million users, and Asia, comprising 48 counties, has 263 million users. Crypto is moving into the mainstream globally and the broad acceptance of digital assets is accelerating. The U.S. Administration’s pro-crypto stance is certainly delivering greater regulatory clarity with the Genius Act for stablecoins and the SEC’s Crypto Task Force. SEC Chair Paul Atkins says the self-custody of crypto is a fundamental American right, linking it to personal freedom and property control. Under Chair Atkins, with the support of Commissioners Hester Peirce and Mark Uyeda, the SEC has dropped most of the crypto lawsuits filed during former chair Gary Gensler’s tenure. Greater regulatory clarity is welcome, and it is increasingly clear that there is a growing change of attitude towards cryptocurrencies among many global regulators driven by a range factors including the prospect of greater economic growth, financial inclusion and wealth creation opportunities for citizens. The markets have witnessed Circle’s eye watering IPO and share price which is helping to drive the path to IPO for crypto exchanges like Kraken, Gemini and Bullish. It is difficult to not conclude that cryptocurrencies and digital assets are becoming respectable. By many estimates, almost half of the professionals working in crypto and digital assets come from TradFi capital markets, top tier banks to asset managers. There has always been somewhat of career risk for TradFi talent working in crypto, especially enduring the hostility by some policymakers and regulators over the past few years. Institutional investment is now piling in crypto - it is estimated that institutions now hold 25% of the U.S. bitcoin ETF market - and this is making crypto more respectable and driving a requirement for TradFi talent that is willing to stake its career on working in the burgeoning digital assets industry. New research by leading European digital assets hedge fund Nickel Digital Asset Management shows that is changing. Nickel Digital itself was founded by an alumnus from Bankers Trust, Goldman Sachs, and JP Morgan. The research surveyed institutional investors and wealth managers in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Switzerland, Singapore, Brazil and the United Arab Emirates who collectively manage over $1 trillion in assets. More than half (53%) surveyed believe the career risk for executives in the crypto industry has fallen under the Trump Presidency with 17% saying it has significantly reduced. Around a third (33%) say the risk has increased with only 1% say it has significantly increased. Mitigating career risks depends largely on regulation of the sector. More than four out of five (83%) questioned said it is extremely or very important in reducing career risk when investing in digital assets with 30% saying it is extremely important. Anatoly Crachilov, ceo and founding partner at Nickel Digital, says, “The mainstream adoption of digital assets pioneered by firms such as BlackRock, Fidelity, and Goldman, has been turbo-charged by the Trump presidency and the fear of career risk is receding, driving greater engagement by traditional allocators. “Robust regulation is central to the growth of the sector but there are more practical issues to be addressed including deeper liquidity and improvements to market infrastructure that will mitigate counterparty risks concerns.” Defined benefit and hybrid pension scheme specialist Cartwright has announced the first bitcoin allocation into the investment portfolio of an unnamed U.K. pension scheme. It described the investment as “a strategic move that, not only offers diversification, but also taps into an asset class with a unique asymmetric risk-return profile.” The Cartwright announcement was denounced as “deeply irresponsible” by some commentators, pointing to the cautionary tale of the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan writing down its $95 million investment in FTX following its bankruptcy. This criticism is misplaced as the FTX bankruptcy was down to the founders committing fraud on a grand scale, and is nothing to do with cryptocurrencies or new blockchain digital technologies. U.S. pension schemes however are not worried. Schemes in Wisconsin and Michigan are major investors in crypto ETFs which are regulated. Texas, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Oklahoma are looking at establishing bitcoin reserves. Zodia Markets Ireland chair Michael Walsh estimates that 1% of crypto ETFs are being bought by U.S. pension funds which sounds small, and adds “1% of a $100 billion market might not seem significant but it represents over a billion dollars with substantial room for growth.” The growth potential in the crypto ETF market is obvious and the direction of travel seems to be up. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) recently bought $970 million Bitcoin in a day and now holds over $56 billion in assets. It is estimated to hold 3% of the total global supply of bitcoin. Blackrock’s IBIT is the one of the hottest ETF tickets in the market, overtaking its S&P 500 ETF in annual revenue. BlackRock ceo Larry Fink has talked about bitcoin replacing the U.S. dollar as the world’s reserve currency due to potential concerns about rising U.S. Government debt, especially following the fresh passage of the new budget bill. With record U.S. debt, weak bond auctions, and the weakest dollar since the 1970s, the threat of the U.S. debt default is looming on the mind of foreign debt holders, with some foreign asset managers publicly stating they are now overweight in both U.S. debt and equity. The Nickel Digital research among firms already invested in digital assets shows growth in crypto markets is driving increased respectability. Markets can drift but as long as they are not crashing there is a continuing confidence that builds over the the longer-term. Nearly nine out of 10 (88%) questioned say they will increase their level of investment in digital assets this year, building on the 67% who said they increased investment in the last year. They expect major investor groups to follow suit. Around 70% predict pension funds will dramatically increase investment in digital assets over the next two years while 57% believe wealth managers will dramatically increase investment and 40% say the same about family offices. Most are increasingly positive about the outlook for digital assets as they increase their understanding of the industry with 90% positive on digital assets as an asset class and 13% saying they are very positive. None of the organisations surveyed were negative on the current market with 10% saying they were neutral. Part of the growing confidence is due to deeper engagement with the digital asset industry and a greater understanding of the investment benefits beyond investment returns. Nickel Digital’s research asked professional investors to rank the benefits of investing in the industry. The ability to trade 24/7 and the efficiency of the DeFi ecosystem are rated as the two major benefits of investing in the sector ahead of the prospect of better returns than other asset classes, which was rated third. Capital appreciation and the role of digital assets as a hedge against currency depreciation were ranked fourth and fifth ahead of yield opportunities and their role as a hedge against inflation. Arbitrage opportunities and low correlation to other asset classes were ranked eighth and ninth. Crachilov stresses the importance of regulation saying, "Regulators play a critical role in supporting the evolution of the digital asset sector. While no regulatory framework can eliminate all possible risks, investors appreciate value of global regulators' drive for transparency, accountability, while, at the same time, providing constructive approach to regulation in the crypto sector." The research found 88% believe the risk of another FTX-style scandal has been reduced with more than a third (35%) saying it has fallen sharply. A similar study in July 2024 by Nickel Digital found 75% believed the risk had dropped with 20% saying it had fallen sharply. Confidence in regulation and growing respectability is encouraging more firms to engage. 43% of institutional investors and wealth managers questioned believe there will be a dramatic increase in traditional financial firms launching crypto funds and investment solutions over the next two years. That increasing involvement by traditional institutions is good news for the sector with nearly one in five (18%) say the involvement of major firms is very positive for the sector and 74% saying it’s quite positive. Performance is key – investors questioned believe crypto will be one of their top five asset classes for risk-adjusted returns over the next five years. Private equity was the next most selected followed by emerging market (EM) equities – EMs have become popular destinations for those asset allocators overweight in U.S. equities. Crypto’s journey to respectability has been a long one. There will be bumps in the road ahead, though the threat of the next crypto winter in the short term appears a lower probability to most crypto analysts and pundits. Many TrandFi analysts and pundits are not as sure they can say same the same about traditional markets.

© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy Canadian dessert chain La Diperie is sending some Arctic chill down to the West Village. The Montreal-based La Diperie, known for its customizable dipped ice cream and treats, has signed a 10-year lease for 1,200 square feet at Midwood Investment and Development’s 56 Seventh Avenue, according to tenant broker RJBRE. Asking rent was $150 per square foot. The deal represents the dessert chain’s first location in New York City, following 65 stores across Canada and a spot in St. Petersburg, Fla., according to its website. La Diperie’s new store between West 13th and West 14th streets will be operated by Kishan and Ashlesha Patel and is slated to open early next year, according to the New York Business Journal, which first reported the news. “This marks La Diperie’s first New York location, and a key step in their U.S. expansion,” RJBRE’s Abraham Smouha, who brokered the deal for the tenant along with Richard Bailey, said in a statement to Commercial Observer. “We’re excited to bring their unique soft-serve experience to one of New York City’s most dynamic corridors,” Smouha added. Capricorn Retail Advisors’ Andrew Schulman, Ryan Schimel and Audrey Hersch represented the landlord in the deal. Schulman and spokespeople for La Diperie and Midwood did not immediately respond to requests for comment. La Diperie’s West Village spot will be at the base of the 159-unit Candela Tower, which Midwood bought from BlackRock Realty Advisors in May 2022 for $102 million, property records show. Other retail tenants at 56 Seventh Avenue include coffee shop Birch Coffee and health food store Elm Wellness. Isabelle Durso can be reached at idurso@commercialobserver.com.

Title: Wall Street Moves on-Chain as Tokenization of US Stocks Goes Global

Highlights Major financial players like J.P. Morgan, Kraken and Robinhood are tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs) — from carbon credits to U.S. equities. Tokenized assets, often offered through offshore entities, allow for fractional ownership, instant settlement and around-the-clock trading. Despite momentum, regulators in the U.S. and Europe have yet to clarify how tokenized securities fit into existing legal frameworks, raising concerns over investor protection, jurisdiction and systemic risk. One of the overarching themes of 2025, outside of its notable levels of uncertainty, is the convergence of traditional finance (TradFi) and crypto markets.

By completing this form, you agree to receive marketing communications from PYMNTS and to the sharing of your information with our sponsor, if applicable, in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions. Δ That theme got a shot in the arm this week, with the news Wednesday (July 2) that J.P. Morgan is reportedly developing a new service to tokenize carbon credits, while on Monday (June 30), crypto exchange Kraken unveiled its long-anticipated platform allowing retail investors to buy tokenized versions of major U.S. equities. That same day, Robinhood also announced it was rolling out tokenized stocks to a select cohort of international users. Crucially, Kraken’s own offerings were similarly available only for eligible non-U.S. clients. While the initiatives may appear distinct, ranging from environmental credits to fractionalized equity exposure, the connective tissue is the same. Moving traditional financial services onto the blockchain. These moves represent a coordinated push by financial giants to tokenize real-world assets (RWAs), sidestep traditional clearing infrastructure, and begin transitioning toward 24/7, programmable trading markets. But these rapid developments also raise existential questions for market regulators and central intermediaries. Are tokenized securities complementary to, or competitive with, traditional capital markets? Can existing legal frameworks scale across these hybrid asset classes? And who bears responsibility when decentralized and centralized elements collide? Read more: The Digital Asset Primer: Why Equity Markets Are Being Tokenized Tokenization, long the buzzword of blockchain evangelists, has entered its next phase. While initial coin offerings (ICOs) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) dominated earlier narratives, the current wave of interest centers around tangible, regulated assets — stocks, bonds, commodities and now carbon credits. Even BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has gone on record alleging that all assets should be tokenized on a blockchain and tradable online, writing in his 2025 annual shareholder letter: “Every stock, every bond, every fund — every asset — can be tokenized.” Kraken and Robinhood’s own tokenized equities operate through offshore subsidiaries to remain compliant with current U.S. laws. These tokenized shares are backed 1:1 by real stocks custodied by licensed brokerages. The twist? Instead of trading through traditional clearinghouses on a T+2 settlement basis, these assets can now be exchanged 24/7 on blockchain rails, with near-instant settlement and global reach. For retail investors, especially outside the U.S., this offers fractional ownership of American blue-chip stocks without intermediaries or time zone constraints. For institutions, it hints at a future where securities can be programmed with smart contracts, auto-execute dividends and facilitate compliance in real time. PYMNTS explored this topic earlier in the month in an interview with Brett McLain, head of payments and blockchain at cryptocurrency exchange Kraken. “The tokenization of real-world assets [has] long been a holy grail for crypto … making those real-world assets more accessible globally to consumers,” McLain said. “We want to see that grow into other things like real estate and other tangible assets.” See also: What Treasury Teams Can Learn From Central Banks’ Tokenization Projects Still, these launches come amid intensifying efforts by U.S. and European regulators to bring coherence to the digital asset ecosystem. And despite the momentum, the regulatory picture remains murky. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has not offered formal guidance on tokenized versions of registered securities traded offshore. These assets are typically structured as derivatives or depositary receipts, akin to synthetic products like CFDs and are not true equities in the traditional sense. As with many innovations, there can be a fine line between democratizing access and weakening safeguards. “These ‘OpenAI tokens’ are not OpenAI equity. We did not partner with Robinhood, were not involved in this, and do not endorse it. Any transfer of OpenAI equity requires our approval—we did not approve any transfer. Please be careful,” tweeted OpenAI’s press account on X (formerly Twitter). Still, regulatory momentum is gathering in the U.S. and PYMNTS covered how Republican senators at the end of last month (June 24) unveiled a set of principles to serve as a framework for the development of legislation for digital assets and crypto markets. “Banks are in the state where they are thinking about blockchains as public infrastructure that they need to rely on,” Chainalysis Co-founder and CEO Jonathan Levin said in an interview with PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster published April 7. “Without a federal framework, it is incredibly difficult for financial services firms and international enterprises to really get comfortable.” Wall Street Moves on-Chain as Tokenization of US Stocks Goes Global European Commission Delays Release of AI Act’s Code of Practice Ford, JPMorgan, Amazon Executives Predict Deep Job Cuts as AI Advances Worldpay Launches Domestic Acquiring Capabilities in Thailand We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) first ran for state office in 2019, her campaign was funded almost entirely by small-dollar donors. As Crockett increased in prominence, however, cryptocurrency moguls, corporations, union bosses, and even foreign governments have lined up to shower her with resources. Crockett, who got her start practicing law, ran to represent a portion of Austin in the Texas House of Representatives in 2020. Early on, her state-level campaign counted on local individuals giving at most a couple hundred dollars apiece to support her. However, as she picked up steam, organized labor and business interests began cutting checks to her political committee as well. Crockett’s biggest financial windfall came during the 2022 election season when super PACs linked to cryptocurrency industry leaders like the since-disgraced Sam Bankman-Fried pumped millions into supporting her bid to replace retiring Democratic Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson. Recommended Stories Zohran Mamdani took money from groups that help illegal immigrants avoid deportation Trump threatens to sue New York Times and CNN over Iran strike coverage Google promoted content from hijacked local news website posting pro-China content Since winning election to the House, Crockett has continued to enjoy contributions from corporate and union PACs. Foreign governments have also jumped aboard, with India, the United Arab Emirates, and a nonprofit group linked to the Qatari government all paying for Crockett and her family to go on expensive trips abroad, according to congressional disclosures. Crockett has emerged as a Democratic firebrand, frequently going viral for her spats with Republicans. Most recently, she has caught criticism for referring to Gov. Greg Abbott (R-TX), who is wheelchair-bound, as “Governor Hot Wheels.” Crockett later argued that the title was not related to the governor’s disability, a claim that was undercut after the Washington Free Beacon reported that she had “liked” content on Facebook making fun of Abbott’s paralysis. The sophomore congresswoman’s jab at Abbott is just one among her many controversial remarks, including criticizing Rep. Byron Donalds (R-FL) for being in an interracial marriage. Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) speaks during the Democratic National Convention on Monday, Aug. 19, 2024, in Chicago. (AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast) When it comes to policy, Crockett identifies as a progressive. For instance, the congresswoman has repeatedly railed against “corporate greed” and praised her colleagues for standing up against “corporate interests.” Campaign finance records, however, show that Crockett has accepted over $370,000 in federal contributions from PACs representing corporations or business associations since 2022. Her donors include pharmaceutical giants such as AbbVie and Gilead Sciences, financial services firms such as BlackRock and Goldman Sachs, major defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin and RTX, and household names such as McDonald’s, Home Depot, CVS, Verizon, and Toyota. The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, along with other major unions, has also provided financial support to Crockett’s state and federal campaigns. Even before she took office, Protect our Future PAC and WEB3 Forward, two PACs funded by crypto moguls such as Bankman-Fried, Ben Horowitz, and Marc Andreessen, spent well over $2 million supporting Crockett’s campaign during a heated Democratic primary. Crockett’s stated disdain for corporate influence goes back to her time running for state office. In a July 10, 2020, tweet, Crockett claimed to have taken zero dollars from corporate PACs while her opposition had accepted nearly $200,000. A campaign finance disclosure covering the period between July 5 and Dec. 31, 2020, however, shows that Crockett accepted thousands in corporate PAC dollars. This means that her tweet was either inaccurate or she began accepting corporate cash shortly after attacking her opponent for doing so. While Crockett has long accepted contributions from corporate PACs, gifts from foreigners are new to her. Between Feb. 21 and 27, 2023, Crockett embarked on a trip to tour Doha, the capital of Qatar. The jaunt, which congressional records show cost over $17,000, was paid for by the United States-Qatar Business Council, a trade association with links to the Qatari government. Sheikha Mayes bint Hamad Al Thani, a member of Qatar’s royal family, is the Qatari managing director of the organization. Additionally, the U.S.-Qatar Business Council maintains a partnership with the Gulf Times, a Qatari state-run news outlet.

Over the course of the trip, the U.S.-Qatar Business Council arranged multiple meetings between Crockett and high-ranking members of the Qatari government. Four other members of Congress — three Republicans and a Democrat — were also invited on the trip. ELITE US UNIVERSITIES PARTNER WITH ARM OF QATARI GOVERNMENT PUSHING ANTI-AMERICAN MEDIA Crockett also went on cultural exchange trips paid for by the Indian and Emirati governments, according to records. “The congresswoman files her financial disclosures and all required documents in accordance with federal law,” Crockett’s chief of staff told the Washington Examiner. 13 posted on 07/03/2025 8:12:39 AM PDT by Liz (This then is how we should pray...."Our Father, who art in heaven......" ) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 12 | View Replies] To: cuz1961 BTTT 14 posted on 07/03/2025 8:13:28 AM PDT by nopardons [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: cuz1961 DNC should be footing the bill for the mass deportation. 15 posted on 07/03/2025 8:18:31 AM PDT by JudyinCanada (Praying that America's Golden Age includes Canada.)

Crockett’s biggest financial windfall came during the 2022 election season when super PACs linked to cryptocurrency industry leaders like the since-disgraced Sam Bankman-Fried pumped millions into supporting her bid to replace retiring Democratic Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson.

Foreign governments have also jumped aboard, with India, the United Arab Emirates, and a nonprofit group linked to the Qatari government all paying for Crockett and her family to go on expensive trips abroad, according to congressional disclosures. Crockett has emerged as a Democratic firebrand, frequently going viral for her spats with Republicans. Most recently, she has caught criticism for referring to Gov. Greg Abbott (R-TX), who is wheelchair-bound, as “Governor Hot Wheels.” Crockett later argued that the title was not related to the governor’s disability, a claim that was undercut after the Washington Free Beacon reported that she had “liked” content on Facebook making fun of Abbott’s paralysis. The sophomore congresswoman’s jab at Abbott is just one among her many controversial remarks, including criticizing Rep. Byron Donalds (R-FL) for being in an interracial marriage. Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) speaks during the Democratic National Convention on Monday, Aug. 19, 2024, in Chicago. (AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast) When it comes to policy, Crockett identifies as a progressive. For instance, the congresswoman has repeatedly railed against “corporate greed” and praised her colleagues for standing up against “corporate interests.” Campaign finance records, however, show that Crockett has accepted over $370,000 in federal contributions from PACs representing corporations or business associations since 2022. Her donors include pharmaceutical giants such as AbbVie and Gilead Sciences, financial services firms such as BlackRock and Goldman Sachs, major defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin and RTX, and household names such as McDonald’s, Home Depot, CVS, Verizon, and Toyota. The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, along with other major unions, has also provided financial support to Crockett’s state and federal campaigns. Even before she took office, Protect our Future PAC and WEB3 Forward, two PACs funded by crypto moguls such as Bankman-Fried, Ben Horowitz, and Marc Andreessen, spent well over $2 million supporting Crockett’s campaign during a heated Democratic primary. Crockett’s stated disdain for corporate influence goes back to her time running for state office. In a July 10, 2020, tweet, Crockett claimed to have taken zero dollars from corporate PACs while her opposition had accepted nearly $200,000. A campaign finance disclosure covering the period between July 5 and Dec. 31, 2020, however, shows that Crockett accepted thousands in corporate PAC dollars. This means that her tweet was either inaccurate or she began accepting corporate cash shortly after attacking her opponent for doing so. While Crockett has long accepted contributions from corporate PACs, gifts from foreigners are new to her. Between Feb. 21 and 27, 2023, Crockett embarked on a trip to tour Doha, the capital of Qatar. The jaunt, which congressional records show cost over $17,000, was paid for by the United States-Qatar Business Council, a trade association with links to the Qatari government. Sheikha Mayes bint Hamad Al Thani, a member of Qatar’s royal family, is the Qatari managing director of the organization.

Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) first ran for state office in 2019, her campaign was funded almost entirely by small-dollar donors. As Crockett increased in prominence, however, cryptocurrency moguls, corporations, union bosses, and even foreign governments have lined up to shower her with resources. Crockett, who got her start practicing law, ran to represent a portion of Austin in the Texas House of Representatives in 2020. Early on, her state-level campaign counted on local individuals giving at most a couple hundred dollars apiece to support her.

It just has to happen. If not, we disappear from history. Is there a downside to this? Not to worry. The CCP, George Soros and his ilk will bail them out. They could beg Nan, Hill, and the other ultra rich in their world. People complain that DOGE didn’t cut $$ Trillions from the US budget I say - that was only its publicly stated purpose It was actually a political attack on the vast money-laundering operation that was Fed.gov funding of leftist NGOs and Democrat politicians. It employed tens of thousands of people, and funded the Left and their political operations for decades. When the BK court has them sell off their assets, who’s going to get congress? No, they are not. They get illegal foreign money like crazy. The DNC is not “broke” but donations are way down.

Side note to the DNC: You can let Hillary do some of the baking. But keep her away from the money box. Crypto bros, corporations, and foreign governments: A look into who funds Jasmine Crockett By Robert Schmad March 27, 2025 5:00 am When Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) first ran for state office in 2019, her campaign was funded almost entirely by small-dollar donors. As Crockett increased in prominence, however, cryptocurrency moguls, corporations, union bosses, and even foreign governments have lined up to shower her with resources. Crockett, who got her start practicing law, ran to represent a portion of Austin in the Texas House of Representatives in 2020. Early on, her state-level campaign counted on local individuals giving at most a couple hundred dollars apiece to support her. However, as she picked up steam, organized labor and business interests began cutting checks to her political committee as well. Crockett’s biggest financial windfall came during the 2022 election season when super PACs linked to cryptocurrency industry leaders like the since-disgraced Sam Bankman-Fried pumped millions into supporting her bid to replace retiring Democratic Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson.

Foreign governments have also jumped aboard, with India, the United Arab Emirates, and a nonprofit group linked to the Qatari government all paying for Crockett and her family to go on expensive trips abroad, according to congressional disclosures. Crockett has emerged as a Democratic firebrand, frequently going viral for her spats with Republicans. Most recently, she has caught criticism for referring to Gov. Greg Abbott (R-TX), who is wheelchair-bound, as “Governor Hot Wheels.” Crockett later argued that the title was not related to the governor’s disability, a claim that was undercut after the Washington Free Beacon reported that she had “liked” content on Facebook making fun of Abbott’s paralysis. The sophomore congresswoman’s jab at Abbott is just one among her many controversial remarks, including criticizing Rep. Byron Donalds (R-FL) for being in an interracial marriage. Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) speaks during the Democratic National Convention on Monday, Aug. 19, 2024, in Chicago. (AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast) When it comes to policy, Crockett identifies as a progressive. For instance, the congresswoman has repeatedly railed against “corporate greed” and praised her colleagues for standing up against “corporate interests.” Campaign finance records, however, show that Crockett has accepted over $370,000 in federal contributions from PACs representing corporations or business associations since 2022. Her donors include pharmaceutical giants such as AbbVie and Gilead Sciences, financial services firms such as BlackRock and Goldman Sachs, major defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin and RTX, and household names such as McDonald’s, Home Depot, CVS, Verizon, and Toyota. The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, along with other major unions, has also provided financial support to Crockett’s state and federal campaigns. Even before she took office, Protect our Future PAC and WEB3 Forward, two PACs funded by crypto moguls such as Bankman-Fried, Ben Horowitz, and Marc Andreessen, spent well over $2 million supporting Crockett’s campaign during a heated Democratic primary. Crockett’s stated disdain for corporate influence goes back to her time running for state office. In a July 10, 2020, tweet, Crockett claimed to have taken zero dollars from corporate PACs while her opposition had accepted nearly $200,000. A campaign finance disclosure covering the period between July 5 and Dec. 31, 2020, however, shows that Crockett accepted thousands in corporate PAC dollars. This means that her tweet was either inaccurate or she began accepting corporate cash shortly after attacking her opponent for doing so. While Crockett has long accepted contributions from corporate PACs, gifts from foreigners are new to her. Between Feb. 21 and 27, 2023, Crockett embarked on a trip to tour Doha, the capital of Qatar. The jaunt, which congressional records show cost over $17,000, was paid for by the United States-Qatar Business Council, a trade association with links to the Qatari government. Sheikha Mayes bint Hamad Al Thani, a member of Qatar’s royal family, is the Qatari managing director of the organization. Additionally, the U.S.-Qatar Business Council maintains a partnership with the Gulf Times, a Qatari state-run news outlet.

Over the course of the trip, the U.S.-Qatar Business Council arranged multiple meetings between Crockett and high-ranking members of the Qatari government. Four other members of Congress — three Republicans and a Democrat — were also invited on the trip.

Though the near-term equity valuations have eased this year, the MSCI India index trades at a forward earnings multiple of about 22.5 — slightly above its 10-year average and nearly double that of broader emerging markets, it said. India’s strong growth outlook should support long-term earnings and justify this premium. “We prefer the equity risk premium as a valuation gauge as it incorporates growth and interest rate assumptions. Our estimate of India’s ERP is about 4.9 per cent — in line with its historical mean, suggesting valuations are not as stretched as multiples imply,” it said. In fixed income, BlackRock Investment Institute maintains a neutral stance on local currency bonds but sees scope to add selectively where real yields are compelling. Vivek Paul, Head of Portfolio Research, BlackRock Investment Institute, said India offers one of the most compelling opportunities across emerging markets for investors looking to tap into mega forces. A large and expanding working-age population, unlike many major economies, bode well for sustained gains in productivity and consumption, he said. India’s digital initiatives such as its unique identification system Aadhaar, scalable payments systems and the open network for digital commerce are widening access, revolutionising transactions and enabling new business models. However, execution risks around harnessing these innovations remain, said the report. On the physical side, capital is flowing into renewable energy, logistics corridors and digital highways — building the foundations for sustained expansion, it said. Infrastructure – at the intersection of several mega forces – is a key focus in 2025 and beyond. Historically, large-scale initiatives, particularly infrastructure and green projects, have relied heavily on domestic public sector funding, leading to higher borrowing costs. “We see private capital playing a larger role than before, opening new investment opportunities,” it said. “We keep a neutral stance on Indian equities in the short term but advocate for above benchmark allocations to Indian equities within strategic portfolios with investment horizons of five years as its economic transformation unfolds,” said the report. “India equities aren’t immune to global risk-off episodes, yet over the long term, we see compelling overlaps between India’s development priorities and our global investment themes,” it said.
