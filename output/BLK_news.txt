By David Kupelian March 11, 2025 Democrats in Congress hate it. “It’s bananas. It’s insane,” U.S. Rep. Jim Himes, D.-Conn., told CNN. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D.-Fla., agrees: “It is utterly preposterous to suggest that we are going to send our military into Panama to, quote, ‘take back the Panama Canal.'” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., speaks for virtually all his congressional peers when he insists, “House Democrats believe that we are not sent to Washington to invade Greenland, rename the Gulf of Mexico or seize the Panama Canal by force!” But as President Donald Trump stated explicitly during his March 4 speech to Congress, the nation and the world: “My administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal – and we’ve already started doing it. Just today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal and a couple of other canals.” The Panama Canal, Trump pointed out, “was built at tremendous cost of American blood and treasure. 38,000 workers died building the Panama Canal. They died of malaria, they died of snakebites and mosquitoes. Not a nice place to work. They paid them very highly to go there, knowing there was a 25% chance that they would die – the most expensive project also that was ever built in our country’s history.” Get the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet – delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts! Trump’s inaugural address: ‘China is operating the Panama Canal, and we didn’t give it to China. We gave it to Panama, and we’re taking it back.’ Concluded the 47th president: “It was given away by the Carter administration for $1. But that agreement has been violated very severely. We didn’t give it to China. We gave it to Panama, and we’re taking it back.” ‘Going to a battlefield’ The astonishingly gruesome process of constructing the Panama Canal – commenced by America in 1904 and completed a decade later – was undertaken to fulfill the centuries-old dream of connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, thereby saving ships from 21-23 extra days at sea by being able to cross through what would become a 51-mile-long waterway. However, “the Panamanian isthmus proved to be one of the most difficult – and deadly – spots in the world in which to construct a channel,” explains History.com: Death could strike in the form of an 18-ton boulder or miniscule, malaria-carrying mosquitoes that bred by the millions in festering swamps and puddles. … “The working condition in those days were so horrible it would stagger your imagination,” recalled laborer Alfred Dottin. “Death was our constant companion. I shall never forget the train loads of dead men being carted away daily, as if they were just so much lumber.” The most dangerous work took place as laborers carved a ditch 45 feet deep and at least 300 feet wide through an eight-mile mountainous stretch known as the Culebra Cut.” Nicknamed “Hell’s Gorge,” the Culebra Cut was a cauldron of noise with roaring locomotives and belching steam shovels where risks of death ranged from drowning to electrocution. Workers blasted away at the mountains with upwards of 60 million pounds of dynamite, which could ignite prematurely in the tropical Panamanian climate. … Flooding regularly submerged equipment, and the unstable ground could give way at any instant. “The work of months or even years might be blotted out by an avalanche of earth,” lamented a senior U.S. administrator. Particularly for workers partially deafened as a side effect of drinking quinine to ward off malaria, the inability to hear made deadly railroad accidents a regular occurrence. In an oral history, George Hodges remembered a fellow worker who fell trying to hop on a train and the wheel of another train “cut his body right in two…as if he had been chopped with a machete.” As one laborer, Antonio Sanchez, explained, working in “the cut” was just like “going to a battlefield.” Fast-forward six decades. In 1976, Democratic presidential candidate Jimmy Carter, campaigning against Gerald Ford, publicly promised – as did Ford – that he would not support transferring the canal from U.S. ownership to Panama, an idea that was then popular with the elites, but not the American people. Yet when he won the presidency, Carter changed his mind and, in 1977, signed the Carter-Torrijos Treaties, transferring total control of the canal to Panama, to take effect on Dec. 31, 1999. Interestingly, during the 1980 presidential election, Ronald Reagan expressed his firm opposition to turning the canal over to Panama … and then defeated Carter in a historic landslide, with a staggering 489 Electoral College votes to Carter’s 49. “When it comes to the [Panama] Canal,” Reagan said, “we built it, we paid for it, it’s ours, and … we are going to keep it!” China’s plans for world domination Today, the big issue cited by Trump and other administration officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, is what has long amounted to the de facto control of the Panama Canal by the nation widely regarded as America’s most dangerous geopolitical adversary. How can that be, many wonder? What happened to the Monroe Doctrine, that revered 200-year-old foreign policy stance established by the fifth U.S. president, James Monroe, holding that any major intervention in the Western Hemisphere – i.e., North, Central or South America – by a foreign power constitutes a potentially hostile act against the U.S.? U.S.-based China expert Gordon Chang – author of several books about China’s barely disguised plans to dominate the world, including his 2024 bestseller, “Plan Red: China’s Project to Destroy America” – says the Panama Canal has long been a “chokepoint” that Beijing wants to control. And as Secretary of State Marco Rubio told SiriusXM’s Megyn Kelly on Jan. 30: “If the government in China in a conflict tells them to shut down the Panama Canal, they will have to. And in fact, I have zero doubt that they have contingency planning to do so. That is a direct threat.” Indeed, as WorldNetDaily reported in February, shortly after Rubio expressed to Panama’s leadership President Trump’s concerns over Chinese influence over the canal, Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulina stated that he would not renew a 2017 “memorandum of understanding” by which Panama joined China’s “Belt and Road Initiative.” “Under that program, China funds the construction and development of infrastructure, such as ports, and then takes control of them for its own profit and empire building,” WND reported, adding: “In the case of the canal, [China] has worked on ports at both ends, creating the possibility that it could shut down the canal if it seemed in the best interests of the Chinese Communist Party. It also has been building bridges over the canal, which would offer the same option.” Rubio explained to Panamanian officials that “the United States cannot, and will not, allow the Chinese Communist Party to continue with its effective and growing control over the Panama Canal area.” And in Congress, a bill has been introduced directing the U.S. to negotiate the repurchase of the canal from Panama. Meanwhile, Trump’s March 4 prime-time announcement that “a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal” referred to BlackRock, the huge U.S.-based investment and asset-management firm. BlackRock purchased the critical ports from CK Hutchison Holdings Limited, officially described as a “Hong Kong-based and Cayman Islands-registered multinational conglomerate corporation” formed in 2015 by a merger of Cheung Kong Holdings and its main associate company Hutchison Whampoa. However, just as with most things concerning Communist China, massive subterfuge and deception are involved. For Hutchinson Whampoa – as a few reality-based media organizations have noted, including this RealClearHistory analysis from January – has been identified as “a front Chinese company that was owned by Chinese military intelligence.” In the report, author Miguel A. Faria succinctly demystifies China’s longtime control of the Panama Canal: The United States built the Panama Canal early in the 20th century with American sweat, toil and money, only to give it away to a leftwing Panamanian dictator via a dubious treaty. The Panamanians, in turn, ceded the Canal to Hutchison Whampoa, a front Chinese company that was owned by Chinese military intelligence. At about the same time, another Chinese front organization, the Hong Kong-based Hutchinson Port Holdings, obtained a 50-year lease to operate the two strategic ports at either end of the Panama Canal. Thus, in case of hostilities, U.S. shipping routes would be cut off and bottled up in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, encircled by the Chinese and their allies Cuba, Venezuela and Panama. To this day, the Chinese deny that they control the Panama Canal, and the American media seem to believe them. President-elect Donald Trump does not. Indeed, the American media have rarely if ever sounded the alarm over this serious threat to U.S. security located right in “America’s backyard” (as Central and South America are commonly referred to in the U.S. global security context). Legacy media stories today instead obsess over Trump’s supposed “expansionist agenda,” his “land grab” obsession and his dangerous vision of “a new U.S. imperialism.” There are a few exceptions, however, including WorldNetDaily, one of the only American media organizations that has sounded the alarm not just recently – but for decades. More than 25 years ago – before the canal was even turned over to the left-wing Panamanian government – WND founder Joseph Farah was passionately making virtually the same arguments Trump has been making during his second term as president. In “Clinton’s Panama Canal admission,” published Dec. 1, 1999, just weeks before Carter’s “gift” of the canal to Panama would take effect (one of many articles Farah wrote during the late ’90s warning about Chinese control of the vital waterway), he focused on then-President Bill Clinton’s public admission that, indeed, China was running the Panama Canal! Was it a Freudian slip? Was it a gaffe? Or was it President Clinton finally being honest about something for the first time in his life? I refer to the statement he made yesterday with regard to the Panama Canal transfer to a group of reporters in the Oval Office before leaving for the West Coast. … Here it is, folks. Hold on to your hats – especially all of you people who scoffed when I began telling you three years ago that the Communist Chinese were taking over the Panama Canal. “I think the Chinese will in fact be bending over backwards to make sure that they run it in a competent and able and fair manner,” Clinton said. That’s verbatim. Those are his words, not mine. Clinton, who has until now denied that the Chinese were to take control of the strategic canal, admitted it publicly. And, as if to underline his admission and seemingly to ensure there could be no misunderstanding of his words, Clinton elaborated. … He compared the operation of the canal to China’s campaign to win admission to the World Trade Organization, which sets the rules for global trade. “They’ll want to demonstrate to a distant part of the world that they can be a responsible partner,” the president said. “And I would be very surprised if any adverse consequences flowed from the Chinese running the canal.” Oh, absolutely. Responsible. Partner. Competent. Fair. Those are all words I readily associate in my mind with the totalitarian government in Beijing. Don’t you? Well, there you have it, folks. Goodbye Panama Canal. The Bamboo Curtain just moved into the Western Hemisphere – officially, that is. After all, I gave you this history long ago. I told you about the fact that a Chinese government company – a front for the military – Hutchison Whampoa Ltd., was to begin operation of the ports on both ends of the strategic waterway Jan. 1. It has been the Clinton administration and its many apologists in Congress and the press who have laughed, ridiculed the idea. Chinese military shill Alexander Haig suggested I should be jailed for making such accusations. And now the truth has finally come out through an unusually candid admission by Clinton. He is telling us now what has been obvious to anyone familiar with the transfer of the canal. He is admitting what former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. Thomas Moorer stated in our pages some time back. Clinton says we can rely on the good intentions of the Chinese to maintain access to the canal. Doesn’t that reassure you? The Chinese, who, as we speak, are rounding up tens of thousands of religious dissidents and interning them, threatening to attack Taiwan and working overtime on developing military technology that could only be used to attack the United States, should be trusted on this Panama Canal deal because it’s a chance for them to show how responsible they really are. This is nuts! When are the American people going to wake up? Clinton is so embarrassed by this deal on the canal that he is not even going to attend the transfer ceremonies. Why? If he doesn’t have any second thoughts and believes giving away the Panama Canal to a hostile foreign power is still a good idea, why not go wave the flag next month at the ceremony? … If ever there was a time – an opportunity – to pressure the politicians to reverse what will someday be judged a historic blunder, it is now. If you really have the guts to stop this thing, America, wake up and take action now. You won’t have to risk your life to write a letter to your senators and representatives in Washington or fill out a simple online petition today. Your kids, however, may someday pay for our mistakes with their blood if you sit silent through this official treachery. The same day, Dec. 1, 1999, this writer published a detailed news article on WND, headlined “In 2000, it’s China Canal,” which included exclusive comments from former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Admiral Thomas Moorer, who assured WorldNetDaily that China’s takeover of the canal “would be catastrophic for the U.S.” Editor’s note: In these historic times, stay informed with fearless, hard-hitting, truthful journalism 24/7.

By DIDI TANG, Associated PressWASHINGTON (AP) — In only two decades, China has grown to be the dominant player in shipbuilding, claiming more than half of the world’s commercial shipbuilding market, while the U.S. share has fallen to just 0.1%, posing serious economic and national security challenges for the U.S. and its allies, according to a report released Tuesday by the Center for Strategic and International Studies.In 2024 alone, one Chinese shipbuilder constructed more commercial vessels by tonnage than the entire U.S. shipbuilding industry has built since the end of World War II.

It will have a huge impact.”In February, the heads of four major labor unions called on Trump to boost American shipbuilding and enforce tariffs and other “strong penalties” against China for its increasing dominance in that sector. “What we are seeing now is a recognition of the strategic significance of shipbuilding and port security, and the related challenges posed by China,” said Matthew Funaiole, a senior fellow in the China Power Project at CSIS and a co-author of the report. Funaiole said concerns over shipbuilding are “a fairly bipartisan issue.”The report said that China’s shipbuilding sector went through “a striking metamorphosis” in the past two decades, transforming from a “peripheral player” to the dominant player on the global market, with efforts centered on one state-owned enterprise: China State Shipbuilding Corporation, or CSSC.At the same time, China has greatly expanded its navy.

Title: Stablecoins Aren’t For Banks—Here’s Why!
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/charleswayn/2025/03/11/stablecoins-arent-for-banks-heres-why/
Time Published: 2025-03-11T15:05:21Z
Full Content:
ByCharles Wayn ByCharles Wayn , Contributor. Golden USDC coins on dark background. 3d iluustration. Recently, we have seen a spate of institutions announce the launch of their own stablecoins, including Societe General, Revolut, and now Bank of America is considering weighing in. One has to question why, though? USDT and USDC - the biggest stablecoins in the industry already account for $200 billion of crypto’s AUM. Accepted widely across most blockchains, centralized and decentralized exchanges, Circle’s USDC and Tether’s USDT are serving the stablecoin market well. Far less volatile than other cryptocurrencies, they are allowing investors to move easily in and out of crypto and preserve their wealth in countries with hyperinflation. And so, why would a bank like Societe General need to launch its own stablecoin? The answer likely lies in the extremely attractive revenue model that stablecoins operate on. Tether, for example, made a cool $13 billion in profit last year - placing it in the gilded company of Goldman Sachs. This is very impressive and certainly something a large bank would resent. Why pay an upstart third party to settle your transactions when you can do it yourself? Yet, while this may be a perfectly sound business decision, dilution of the stablecoin market would quite literally defeat the object of its existence. Digital assets already suffer from a liquidity issue - with a market cap of around $3trn and the majority of that held in Bitcoin by long-term investors, crypto traders are often hamstrung by this lack. Having two well capitalised, liquid stablecoins is a big bonus in this market and one we should be careful to tinker with. Both USDT and USDC fought hard to win credibility and trust in the industry for many years. They have weathered some of the hardest financial storms while other coins haven’t even scratched the surface compared to the majors. While many stablecoins such as DAI, PYUSD, and Sky Dollar have emerged within the last few years, none have proved themselves at the level these two have. As such, many market participants continue to rely on these two tokens, with their dominance growing even in the face of rising competition. For reference (at the time of writing this), DAI’s market cap is at around 5.3 billion, while PYUSD has a market cap of roughly $741 million. While impressive, this doesn’t even scratch the surface of USDC’s $60 billion and USDT’s huge $142 billion market cap. Despite this, though - and this only goes to serve as a stronger argument as to why banks should stay out of stablecoins – USDT now finds itself in hot water as it is allegedly not complying with the European Union’s new rules on stablecoins. As such it is set to be delisted from major centralized exchanges like Binance, Crypto.com, Coinbase, and more for European customers. Some might argue that this is a great moment to open the stablecoin market to competition, but if USDT with its decade of experience and billions of dollars of AUM can’t get past the EU, what chance does a much smaller coin have? Granted, those coming out of banks will have an advantage, but they will still face regulatory hurdles that remain a moving target - especially in the US. Of course, in this war of regulation, USDC has been winning for some time. Circle’s laser focus on compliance and backing from institutional behemoths like BlackRock have made it the stablecoin of choice for traditional finance institutions (though crypto natives still view it with caution thanks to its willingness to bow to government sanctions). And, perhaps unsurprisingly, founder Jeremy Allaire holds a similar view on the stablecoin market. In a recent interview in Hong Kong, Allaire stated there really is no need for CBDC’s as the stablecoin market already exists. It is thriving, it is liquid and it is working. Rather, regulators should understand stablecoins and make better rules. Stablecoins must be easily tradable and liquid. This is where having just two majorly traded coins wins. There is no time of the day or night that any trader cannot buy or sell USDT or USDC on any kind of platform (well, for now, at least). If we start to see the market segment into various stablecoins that perhaps larger institutions insist must be used inside their ecosystems, this will impact liquidity, trading, and costs. Charges are likely to increase as without sufficient liquidity the cost of executing transactions tends to rise - as those who battled ETH gas prices in the summer of 2020 remember all too well. This can lead to an expensive, fragmented, and slow investor experience. This should not be the future the stablecoin market or the cryptocurrency industry at large is marching into. Rather than fragmentation we need cohesion and deeper liquidity in order for stablecoins to be treated as a legitimate asset within the financial ecosystem. That said, despite its dominance, USDT faces a fight for its life against new European regulation – Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA). This regulation requires stablecoin issuers like Tether to obtain an e-money license to enhance anti-money laundering compliance. However, as mentioned previously, Tether has failed to comply with this regulatory guidance and is not standing down. This will ultimately give USDC the lead, with potentially another challenger entering the ring - at least in Europe. On the other hand, incoming US regulation may take a different view which could mean Europe isn’t such a big deal. Since President Donald Trump’s recent election win, stablecoin market cap has grown by a whopping $40 billion. Regardless of this setback, a plethora of bank-issued stablecoins is not the answer. Banks don’t like paying anybody fees, but – again – as we in the crypto industry know, fees are part of the game to maintain security and ensure smooth blockchain operations. Institutions should get used to that and enjoy liquid markets rather than try to hold onto $25 per transaction, which could create fragmentation and ultimately hinder the mass adoption of stablecoins.

Title: This Simple Investing Blunder Could Cost You 8%+ Dividends

Time Published: 2025-03-11T12:15:00Z
Full Content:
Investing Mistake I recently got some reader feedback that made me realize something: When it comes to our favorite income investments—8%+ yielding closed-end funds (CEFs)—there are still a lot of misconceptions out there. It’s key that we put those right, because they’re causing some investors to miss out on CEFs, and the big (and often monthly) dividends they provide. And I know I don’t have to tell you that in turbulent times like these, high payouts like those are a lifesaver. This reader wrote in response to a recent piece I wrote about how CEFs can be better than ETFs, pointing out two things: Let’s address both of these concerns because they are valid—and both are often cited by financial advisors and the mainstream media as reasons to avoid CEFs and invest in ETFs, like the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY). Following that advice can cost you significant dividends: CEFs currently yield 8.5% on average, while SPY, the largest ETF by market cap, yields a paltry 1.4%. So, let’s dig into the first issue. I am not going to disagree with the feedback here, because it is true. On average, CEFs have management fees of 2.9%, which sounds very high compared to what you’d pay on the average index fund. I should note before we go further, though, that the two CEFs we’ll get into below (both of which appeared in the article)—the Virtus Artificial Intelligence & Technology Opportunities Fund (AIO) and the Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund (STK)—charge much less: about 2.7% for AIO and 1.1% for STK. The fees for the BlackRock Science and Technology Trust (BST), the other fund mentioned in that article, are about the same as STK, at 1.09%, but we’re going to focus more on the other two funds, and the opportunity we have in them, today. Here’s where our reader picked up on a common misunderstanding about CEF fees, suggesting that these fees are taken out of the income and total returns these funds provide. In other words, if the fee were to be taken out of AIO’s dividend, its 7.8% yield would actually amount to 5.1%, net of fees. But this isn’t how CEF fees work. Let’s take the most important detail first: The fees that CEFs charge are taken out of the fund’s portfolio before distributing dividends. The fund will not remove it from the yield you receive: If AIO yields 7.8%, that means you will get $780 a year for every $10,000 you invest. The fees are taken care of on the back end, before AIO reports its capital gains and pays out distributions, so all the profits I’m about to show you are net of fees. Are the fees justified? In my opinion, getting $78,000 on a million-dollar nest egg is worth it, since the low-fee alternative offers $14,000 in dividends on that same million bucks. Also, I should point out that those CEF fees tend to remain as low as possible because of competition. The fees that CEFs charge are a combination of administrative fees, payment to fund managers (which is often the smallest part of the fund’s assets, typically around 0.07%), and payment for things like leverage costs (both of these funds typically borrow money to fund investments, and AIO is currently borrowing more than STK, which is why its fees are higher). In the end, though, this one chart is why I think the fees are justified, even without accounting for these funds’ much higher yields. CEFs Outperform Both AIO (in blue) and STK (in purple) have outperformed the S&P 500 since AIO’s inception (it was released in late 2019, which is why this chart goes only that far). And STK’s outperformance goes back much further. STK Total Returns Now, to be sure, these funds are weighted toward tech, but it is also worth pointing out that the S&P 500 has been increasingly weighted to tech stocks (now about 45% of the index), which explains some of the outperformance here. But with fees as “high” as the ones they’re charging, you’d expect SPY to be more competitive (again net of fees). To be sure, the SPY shareholder paid less in fees. But the SPY shareholder also missed out on $1.137 of profits for every dollar they would have put into STK when it launched. The second criticism also has some merit, although maybe not in the way the reader meant. Let me explain. CEF Premiums Both of these funds have a fixed number of shares they issue to the general public (this is fixed at the IPO). This is why the fund is called a closed end fund. While those shares trade on exchanges, like any stock, the issuer can’t issue new shares to grow the fund. The price of a share of a CEF will fluctuate according to supply and demand, which means its market price can drift up or down from the liquidation value of all of its assets on the open market, which is called the net asset value, or NAV. Above you can see AIO is trading at a 6.5% premium to NAV as I write this, while STK’s 1.5% premium is smaller than the 10%+ premiums it’s had in the past, and is pretty close to trading at par. So, yes, you can get Microsoft cheaper than you can by buying it with AIO (by the way, MSFT is 3.24% of AIO’s portfolio, its second-largest position). How? By buying STK! But of course, these are still both premiums. Lucky for us, we can do even better, by purchasing a heavily discounted CEF like the 9.4%-yielding Liberty All-Star Growth Fund (ASG), a recommendation of my CEF Insider service trading at a 7.9% discount to NAV, with Microsoft as its top position, at 4% of assets, followed by NVIDIA (NVDA) at 3.3%. And check this out. Swappable CEFs See how ASG (in blue) is at that 7.9% discount as of this writing, while AIO (in purple) is at a 6.5% premium, but in 2020, ASG traded at a premium and AIO traded at a discount? If you’re thinking there’s an opportunity here to buy ASG when it’s discounted, sell when it’s at a premium, then buy AIO when it’s at a discount and do the opposite trade when AIO swings to a premium, you’re right. This isn’t just what some niche hedge funds do. It’s also the kind of move we’re always looking to make at CEF Insider. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

"I think if we all are becoming a little more nationalistic—and I’m not saying that’s a bad thing, you know, it does resonate with me—that it’s going to have elevated inflation," BlackRock’s Larry Fink told CeraWeek conference attendees, it was reported by Reuters. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs economists have upped their odds of a recession over the next 12 months from 15% to 20%, pointing to Trump’s economic policies as the “key risk." Yardeni Research economists have also raised their recession odds, increasing them from 20% to 35% due to "Trump 2.0’s head-spinning barrage of executives orders, firings, and tariffs." Last week, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said the Fed is in no rush to cut rates, with the labor market still strong and inflation on a bumpy path toward its 2% goal.

"This market downturn is largely driven by broader economic concerns, including fears of a U.S. recession and persistent inflation," Sean Dawson, head of research at decentralized options trading platform Derive.xyz, said in emailed comments. “The market is facing significant challenges as the macroeconomic environment worsens, and crypto assets are no exception. With bearish sentiment building, traders are turning to downside hedging strategies, especially as volatility surges across both traditional and crypto markets. The coming weeks will be critical for assessing how the broader economic situation impacts digital asset prices and trading behavior."

More Info The Panama Canal is considering an idea to build a pipeline to ship liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) across the key trade chokepoint to potentially bring gas from the U.S. to Japan, according to the canal administrator Ricaurte Vasquez. “We're exploring the possibility of rolling out infrastructure with the capacity to move up to a million barrels per day (bpd), but the market is much larger,” Vasquez told Reuters. The canal authorities see moving gas through Panama as a top priority, but it’s also highly complex, according to Vasquez. The canal administrator cited initial studies pointing out that the possible capacity of LPG traffic through the Panama Canal could reach 2 million bpd in a decade. The administration of the Panama Canal expects to decide over the next year whether it would proceed with the plan, Vasquez told Reuters. The idea to move gas through the canal comes amid heightened tensions between the U.S. Administration and Panama, after President Donald Trump said America should take back the canal it had helped build. Earlier this month, a consortium led by BlackRock bought two ports on either side of the Panama Canal just a few weeks after President Trump threatened to use force to restore U.S. control over the energy chokepoint. The deal was worth $22.8 billion and also involved a few dozen ports around the world. The finance major paid $19 billion for the ports of Balboa and Cristobal to CK Hutchinson, which is owned by one of Asia’s wealthiest individuals, Hong Kong billionaire investor Li Ka-Shing. Along with the Panama ports, CK Hutchinson will also sell its controlling stakes in 43 other ports in 23 countries. President Trump hailed the deal, saying last week in a speech in the U.S Congress that “My administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we've already started doing it.” By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.com More Top Reads From Oilprice.com Join the discussion | Back to homepage Previous Post Kazakhstan in Talks With Big Oil to Cut Output Next Post U.S. LNG Developers Seek Higher Delivery Prices as Costs Surge Tsvetana is a writer for Oilprice.com with over a decade of experience writing for news outlets such as iNVEZZ and SeeNews.

Title: BlackRock’s Takeover of Panama Canal Is First Major Victory for Trump’s “Americas First” Policy

But what could it mean for China’s trade relations with Latin America, in particular the US’ largest trade partner Mexico? Midway through last week, as the economic reverberations from Trump’s latest round of tariffs spread around the world, the Hong Kong-based (and Cayman Islands-registered) conglomerate CK Hutchison Holdings caught global markets off guard. Straight out of the blue, the company announced that it was selling 80% of its subsidiary Hutchison Port Holdings, including its 90% stake in the Balboa and Cristobal docks at either end of the Panama Canal, to a consortium led by BlackRock, the world’s largest investment manager. An Associated Press article reported that the sale effectively puts “the ports under American control after President Donald Trump [had] alleged Chinese interference with the operations of the critical shipping lane.” In a speech to the US Congress on March 4, Donald Trump bragged: To further enhance our national security, my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal. And we’ve already started doing it. Just today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal, and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal, and a couple of other canals. CK Hutchison’s decision to sell up its port holdings company in a deal valued at nearly $23 billion, including $5 billion in debt, gives the BlackRock consortium control over dozens of ports in more than 20 countries. They include the Panamanian ports of Balboa and Cristobal, four ports in Mexico, 13 in Europe, 12 in the Middle East and Africa, and 11 in East Asia and the Pacific. Unsurprisingly, Hutchison will retain control of its 10 docks in China, including two in Hong Kong. It is debatable just how good a financial deal this was for the BlackRock-led consortium. As Yves points out in the comments below, participation in the Panama Canal could prove to be more of a curse than a blessing, especially given Panama’s ongoing water crisis. The canal already experienced a 29% drop in ship transits during fiscal year 2024 due to severe drought conditions, according to the Panama Canal Authority (ACP). The decision to sell the canal was driven primarily by geopolitical concerns, as reports the South China Morning Post: CK Hutchison Holdings’ decision to sell its port operations in the Panama Canal and elsewhere is to mitigate against geopolitical risks even though it framed it as a purely commercial move, analysts and sources said, urging Hong Kong’s other major companies to also prepare for unparalleled global uncertainties. From a geopolitical perspective, the deal represents a victory for the Trump administration and a setback for China’s belt-and-road ambitions given that some 6% of global trade passes through the Panama Canal. There could be alternative express trade routes connecting the Atlantic and Pacific oceans some time in the not-too-distant future, however. Nicaragua, a close ally of China and Russia, has recently revived plans to build its own canal, though it will take years to complete, assuming it ever is. There is also Mexico’s Interoceanic Corridor of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec (CIIT), a multibillion-dollar project that connects the port of Salina Cruz, on Oaxaca’s Pacific coast, with Coatzacoalcos, on the Gulf of Mexico with both freight and passenger rail travel (h/t upstater). As we reported in 2023, the project, if well-executed, could hold the key to hedging the global economy’s dependence on the drought-hit Panama Canal. And the good news is that the project is relatively close to completion. Money has been pouring in from all sides, including up to $2.8 billion from the Inter-American Investment Bank. The south-eastern region of Mexico across which the CIIT will eventually criss-cross is one of Mexico’s poorest, but both the AMLO and Sheinbaum governments have prioritised its economic development. The region has also been receiving significant Chinese investments over the past decade while US companies have largely neglected it, preferring to focus on Mexico’s northern border regions, according to a 2023 report by Mexico Business News. Whether that trend continues time will soon tell. Back in Panama, China will presumably continue to have sway over the economy. But there’s no denying that the BlackRock-led consortium’s takeover of the canal’s two main ports signifies a clear shift toward closer realignment of Panama with Washington’s interests. It also represents a major milestone for BlackRock’s global infrastructure ambitions, as Benjamin Norton notes in his Geopolitical Economy Report: BlackRock is the world’s biggest investment company. It managed a record high of $11.6 trillion in assets in the fourth quarter of 2024. (The top 500 investment managers on Earth together held $128 trillion in assets at the end of 2023.) The Associated Press reported that the BlackRock-led consortium now controls at least 43 ports in 23 countries. The Wall Street giant’s subsidiary Global Infrastructure Partners was central to the US government-sponsored Partnership on Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGI), which was launched by the Joe Biden administration and the G7. BlackRock’s billionaire CEO Larry Fink was invited to sit with Western heads of state at the G7 summit in Italy in 2024, where he called for “public-private partnerships” to help Wall Street firms buy up global infrastructure, especially in poor, formerly colonized countries. BlackRock has enjoyed a very close relationship with the US government, under both Democrats and Republicans. Fink said before the US presidential election in November 2024 that it “really doesn’t matter” who wins, because both parties would benefit Wall Street. Bloomberg reported that Fink personally called Trump and asked him to help BlackRock purchase the Panama Canal ports. The financial media outlet noted that the billionaire CEO bragged of BlackRock’s deep links with governments worldwide, stating, “We are increasingly the first call”. Trying to Halt a 25-year Trend As we have documented in numerous posts since the summer of 2021, the US’ apex strategic rival, China, has not only gained a foothold in the US’ backyard in the past three decades but has even begun to win the race for economic supremacy in the region. China is already South America’s largest trade partner, and as we saw with the recent opening of the Chinese-funded and controlled mega-port in Chancay, Peru, its Belt and Road Initiative promises to further cement that position. Besides Hutchinson’s controlling stake of Panama’s two main ports since 2015, the Trump administration’s main bone of contention with the Central American nation was the fact that its government, like most governments in Latin America, had signed the Belt and Road Initiative. In fact, Panama was the first Latin America country to do so, in 2017. Since then, 20 other countries in the region have signed the initiative, including Venezuela, Chile, Uruguay, Ecuador, Bolivia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Perú, Nicaragua and Argentina. To placate Washington’s demands, the Panamanian President José Raúl Mulino said he would not renew Panama’s Belt-and-Road membership when it comes up for review, becoming the first country in the region to leave Beijing’s global infrastructure initiative. He also mentioned the possibility of his government reconsidering the concession granted to Hutchinson Ports. The move sparked an unusually sharp rebuke from Beijing slamming Washington’s “Cold War mentality” in Latin America. From Al Jazeera: A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People’s Republic of China on Friday hit out at the United States for sabotaging the global infrastructure programme. Beijing “firmly opposes the United States using pressure and coercion to smear and undermine Belt and Road cooperation,” said Lin Jian in a statement. “The US side’s attacks … once again expose its hegemonic nature.” Referring to a visit this week to the region by Marco Rubio, Lin said the US Secretary of State’s comments “unjustly accuse China, deliberately sow discord between China and relevant Latin American countries, interfere in China’s internal affairs, and undermine China’s legitimate rights and interests”. A Different Vision of Multipolarity With Trump back in power, the US may have finally accepted the multipolar reality of today’s world but, as Conor noted in his recent post, The Empire Rebrands: Foreign Policy Under Trump 2.0, the Washington’s vision of multipolarity differs markedly from the one envisioned by China, Russia and other countries in the so-called “Global South”: As many have pointed out, the US seeks win-lose transactions, and this is nothing new under Trump. As Glenn Diesen states: In a multipolar world, security is enhanced by reducing the security competition between the great powers, while a mutually beneficial peace can exist under a balance of power and acceptance of the status quo. Even small- and medium-sized states can obtain more political autonomy from the great powers by cooperating with all great powers to diversify their economic connectivity. However, the US appears to be attempting to defeat China as its main rival, and coerce small and medium states into spheres of influence to ensure political and economic obedience. This is now playing out in Latin America. It is no coincidence that the US’ new Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s first international tour was to the five Central American countries of Panama, El Salvador, Guatemala, the Dominican Republic and Costa Rica. Officially speaking, Rubio was visiting these countries for three main reasons: to stop mass illegal immigration to the US; to fight the “scourge of transnational criminal organizations and drug traffickers”; and “to counter China, and deepen economic partnerships to enhance prosperity in our hemisphere.” As a trading power, the US continues to holds significant sway over Central America. Pound for pound, it is still Latin America and the Caribbean’s largest trading partner. But that is predominantly due to its huge trade flows with Mexico, which account for a whopping 71% of all US-LatAm trade. As Reuters reported in 2022, if you take Mexico out of the equation, China has already overtaken the US as Latin America’s largest trading partner. Meanwhile, China’s trade with Mexico, as with most parts of Central America, is growing fast, or at least was. And it is this trend that the Trump administration wants to halt, or even reverse. In order to achieve that, Trump 2.0 is, according to the Washington Post, “reviving” the two-centuries old Monroe Doctrine: Long-attuned to U.S. slights both perceived and real, few [policy makers in the region] missed Trump’s throwaway line during his signing of executive orders just hours after his inauguration. Relations with Latin America “should be great,” he told reporters in the Oval Office. “They need us much more than we need them. We don’t need them.” “What is the point of saying that?” asked the senior South American official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid drawing unwanted attention to his country. “It’s destroying trust. … Instead of inviting us to a new vision, he doesn’t invite anybody. There are only threats.” Of course, the Monroe Doctrine never went away, it has just waxed and waned. During the first two decades of this century, it took a back seat as Washington focused on executing its War on Terror in the Middle East. As it squandered trillions of dollars spreading mayhem and death and breeding a whole new generation of terrorists, China began snapping up Latin American resources, in particular food, petroleum and strategic minerals like lithium. But even during this time Washington was able to organise a failed coup d’état against Hugo Chavez’s government in Venezuela (2002) and a successful coup against Manuel Zelaya’s government in Honduras (2009). There was another unsuccessful coup against Venezuela’s Chavista government in 2019 as well as a successful one in Bolivia. The partly self-inflicted downfall of Peru’s socialist leader Pedro Castillo in 2022 also got the prior blessing from Washington’s ambassador in Lima and former CIA agent, Lisa Kenna . By the early 2020s, it was clear that Washington had begun rejigging the Monroe Doctrine, a 202-year old US foreign policy position that opposed European colonialism on the American continent, in order to apply it to its most important strategic rivals of today, including China, Russia, Iran and even Hezbollah. Just this past week, a bipartisan bill titled the “No Hezbollah in Our Hemisphere Act” was introduced to the US Congress seeking to counter the Lebanese terrorist group’s influence in the region. But it is China’s rapid rise in the US’ own “backyard” that is of greatest concern in Washington. Unlike the US, Beijing offers win-win trade and investment deals to national governments in the region. It also does not tend to meddle in internal politics, or at least hasn’t until now, preferring to let the money do the talking. As the former US Treasury Secretary Laurence Summers once admitted, “When a Latin American head of state asked me for something, I lectured them. While I was preaching, the Chinese were building airports.” When it comes to international trade, win-win strategies tend to work far better than the zero sum games pursued by Washington. As China’s influence in the region has grown, it is the US military that has done a lot of the talking. In January 2023, General Laura Richardson, the then-Commander of US Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM), reminded the Atlantic Council of just how important Latin America’s resources are as well as the need to “box out” China and Russia from them. In other words, despite what the Washington Post may claim, the Trump Administration’s attempted shakedown of small and mid-sized Latin American countries does not represent the revival of the Monroe Doctrine. That said, it does represent a significant escalation in that trend, and one that many countries in the region and beyond will be keeping a close eye on — including, of course, China. This time around, China’s government is taking a much harder line against Trump’s aggressive foreign and trade policy, including on the American continent. Last month, the country’s foreign minister Wang Yi warned that Latin America is not the “backyard” of any country amid attempts by the Trump administration to browbeat reengage with countries in the region. “Latin America is the home of the Latin American people, not the backyard of any country,” Wang told Sosa, according to a statement released by Beijing. “China supports Latin American countries in defending their sovereignty, independence, and national dignity.” If anything, China is seeking to intensify its strategic relations with countries in the region, particularly in South America. As the Mexican expert in international relations Brenda Estefan recently wrote last month for American Quarterly, the US may have notched up an early victory in Panama but convincing other countries, particularly in South America, to leave China’s orbit is likely to be more challenging: Beijing currently maintains “strategic partnerships” with 10 of the 11 South American nations it engages with, with Guyana being the only exception, as it maintains only standard bilateral relations… In January, during a visit to Beijing, I met with Chinese business leaders whose inclination to deepen their investments in Latin America, particularly in Mexico, was unmistakable. Our discussions revealed China no longer perceives Latin America as a resource supplier but as a pivotal part of its ambitious global economic agenda… … Brazil—Latin America’s largest economy—is largely a lost cause for Washington, as it has significantly deepened its ties with Beijing. Chinese firms have invested in major infrastructure projects ranging from ports and railways to power grids. China is now Brazil’s largest trading partner, absorbing most of its exports, including soy, beef, coffee, and iron. In 2023, bilateral trade reached a record $181 billion. Moreover, Brazil and China have strengthened their geopolitical ties through BRICS, further complicating Washington’s ability to exert influence. Of all the countries in the region, Peru draws the highest level of Chinese investment relative to GDP. The most significant of these investments was the recently inaugurated deep-water port at Chancay, which is intended to serve as a direct trade link between China and South America. After Trump’s electoral triumph, one of his advisors even proposed imposing tariffs on goods passing through Chancay. Argentina is another interesting case. Before coming to power in late 2023, President Javier Milei talked openly about cutting all ties with China’s “murderous” dictatorship, only to backtrack once in office. There was a simple reason for this: since 2009 Argentina has had a currency swap arrangement with Beijing which has helped to ensure some degree of exchange rate stability for Argentina while also deepening trade between the two countries. Given the sorry state of Argentina’s finances, Milei was in no position to turn his nose up at any outside financing. Indeed, by October 2024, almost exactly a year after telling Tucker Carlson that he would never trade with China due to its government’s left-wing, authoritarian proclivities, Javier Milei had nothing but fond words for the US’ main strategic rival today. “China is a very interesting trading partner,” said Javier Milei, who just a year earlier had described the Chinese government as as “assassin.” They “do not make demands, the only thing they ask is that they not be bothered.” Mexico, Between a Rock and a Hard Place There can be no doubt that the US’s main priority is to drive a very large wedge between Mexico, its largest trade partner, and China, its second largest. According to Norwegian logistics firm Xeneta, the Mexico-China trade route is now the fastest-growing in the world, as China has sought to use Mexico’s fast-growing industrial base as a stepping stone for the US market. Given the extent of economic integration between the US and Mexico, Washington is determined to put an end to this trend. And so far, Mexico has buckled each time the US has applied pressure. Last April, the AMLO government announced hundreds of “temporary” tariffs on imports from countries with whom it does not have a trade agreement. The tariffs were imposed on 544 imported products, including footwear, wood, plastic, electrical material, musical instruments, furniture, and steel, and ranged from 5% to 50% in size. They had one clear target in mind: imports from China though the word “China” was not mentioned once in the decree. While the growing deployment of protectionist measures in Mexico, largely at the behest of the US, has elicited rare criticism in the Mexican business press, it seems that the Claudia Sheinbaum government is poised to continue this policy. From Bloomberg: Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said her country would review tariffs on Chinese shipments, a move that could give the Trump administration a win in its push to build a “Fortress North America” that blocks shipments from the Asian nation. “We have to review the tariffs that we have with China,” Sheinbaum said at a press conference Thursday. She pointed to Mexico’s problems in textile and shoe production, saying: “Much of the entry of Chinese products into Mexico caused this industry to fall in our country.” The comments come after President Donald Trump offered major reprieves to Mexico and Canada, the US’s two largest trading partners, by exempting goods from those nations that are covered by the North American trade agreement known as USMCA from his 25% tariffs. There’s a clear logic behind this. For a start, the economies of Mexico and the US are already so intertwined that trying to disentangle them will be an ungodly task. A staggering 83% of Mexico’s exports, many of which are goods assembled by US manufacturers in Mexican maquiladoras, go to the US. If a large part of those supply chains was threatened, the result for Mexico would be a deep economic crisis with millions losing their jobs, which in turn would endanger the ruling party MORENA’s entire economic project. As I’ve noted in previous pieces, Mexico is caught in the middle of a titanic duel between the world’s two rival economic superpowers. While Brazil’s Lula may have invited Claudia Sheinbaum to the next BRICS meeting, the chances of Mexico becoming a BRICS nation any time soon is still razor thin, even as the Trump administration does everything it can to dynamite the USMCA trade deal, and its constituent economies. For one thing, it will take years for Mexico to pivot its economy away from the US. Also, as AMLO said last year, Mexico’s geographic reality simply means it has little choice in the matter: We cannot shut ourselves off, we cannot break up, we cannot isolate ourselves. It is a fact that we have 3,800 kilometres of shared border, for reasons of geopolitics (presumably in reference to the US’ invasion, occupation and appropriation of more than half of Mexico’s territory in the mid-19th century). With all due respect, we are not a European country, nor are we Brazil. We have this neighbourhood and, furthermore, if we agree on things, as we have done, we can help each other out… However, helping out the US essentially means hitching Mexico’s economy to a declining superpower that appears to be on the verge of inflicting upon itself — and by extension, large parts of the world — a severe economic crisis while at the same time adopting an increasingly belligerent approach to adversaries and allies alike. This time around, however, China is adopting a tougher response to US and broader Western provocations. Just a few days ago, Beijing imposed a 100% tariff on Canadian rapeseed oil, oilcake and peas and a 25% tariff on aquatic products and pork from Canada as a retaliation for Ottawa’s escalating tariffs on Chinese-made electric cars and other products. While Mexico’s exports to China are negligible, representing just over 2% of the total, a chill on diplomatic and commercial relations with China will mean even greater dependence on the big neighbour to the North as well as loss of influence in the Global South, which is just how Washington wants it. BlackRock’s Takeover of Panama Canal Is First Major Victory for Trump’s “Americas First” Policy, It is also a major victory for Wall Street. So the obvious, to me, is to ask the question victory for whom? “America First” you say, Wall Street? Are the two the same or divergent? That There can be no denying it: the deal is a major geopolitical victory for the Trump administration… I’m ready to concede if it is the U.S. flexing its military/financial/ political influence in this hemisphere viz-a-viz China. A victory for those Americans on Soc. Sec. and under a insufferable burden of debt, living precariously from day-to-day, victory? ah…not so much. Woodrow Wison wrote: “Since trade ignores national boundaries and the manufacturer insists on having the world as a market, the flag of his nation must follow him, and the doors of the nations which are closed against him must be battered down. Concessions obtained by financiers must be safeguarded by ministers of state, even if the sovereignty of unwilling nations be outraged in the process. Colonies must be obtained or planted, in order that no useful corner of the world may be overlooked or left unused.” It is, in much the same terms, Lenin’s theory of imperialism. In whatever terms, both Trump and Xi understand this. Yes, and of course the most notorious period of Latin American intervention was the post WW2 Cold War when our FP elites were allegedly fighting communism–a mere idea–rather than a trading rival. Many of us thought back then that Reagan was doing in Latin America what he and the MIC would do in this country if they could get away with it. Perhaps one explanation for today’s world wide elite tolerance of massacres in the ME and Africa is that they keep the colonialist dream alive in the spirit of Pizarro and Cortes and even Columbus. As Madeleine Albright said, “why do we have this giant military if we aren’t going to use it?” Why indeed. Trump of course is waxing nostalgic for the even older McKinley period when the Philippines gained our benevolent attention. But American imperialism was always a mere me too version of what Europe had been doing. After all it was Spain and Portugal who created all those Latin American countries. With luck buying a few ports will satisfy Trump’s urge for territorial glory. Multipolarity is a rational and desirable thing but it is not the historical trend. We couldn’t hardly wait to grant independence to the Philippines just after WW2, that’s how important it was to us, Puerto Rico (‘Rich Door’ in Spanish) is somewhat of a basket case, Cuba has been our sworn enemy going on 65 years now, leaving us with Guam for the win, of our circa 1898 territorial conquests. We weren’t very good at colonialism as it turns out. Europe, on the other hand… Not for nothing has Woodrow Wilson been called one of America’s most evil Presidents. Right down there with Clinton, Cheney (bush) and Obama. Yes, but give Wilson his due. Wisdom resides in changing the things we can change, accepting the things we can’t change, and making money off of the rest. While reading this post, one line stuck out which said ‘the BlackRock consortium control over 43 ports in 23 countries.’ I have read this before but I am now wondering how far back that Blackrock has been acquiring ports. Thing is, as soon as Trump got in he was talking about the US seizing places that had shipping lanes go through them (Panama) or had vital shipping lanes go by them (Greenland) and of course the US is setting up bases on places like the Galapagos Islands which also have trade routes go by them. So when you think about it, if you have the government trying to seize control of the world’s shipping routes while at the same time you had US Blackrock buying up strategic ports, it seems that the new strategy of the deep state government is to control the world’s shipping routes to strangle any country that they did not like. So this must be one of those public-private partnerships that you keep on hearing about. /sarc Please stop the hyperventilating. China has been buying up ports. So now the US is catching up? The only difference it is the Trump noisemaking. CK Hutchison Holding is probably laughing all the way to the bank. Panama is in the midst of a crisis over water. Not enough for the canal and local farms, to the degree that it was causing local unrest. So now America which I believe also has a base there gets to be the bad guy water hog. Sure China is buying up ports if not building them and perhaps that reflects the number of engineers in their National People’s Congress. They are all about infrastructure after all. But the point I was trying to make was the combination of controlling trade routes and controlling the ports that they stop off at. Trump wants Greenland for control of shipping routes coming out of the Arctic. All those mineral resources to be mined there would be just to pay for it all. I doubt that this is all a Trump idea but somebody for years now has been feeding him such plans about controlling the world’s shipping routes and ports. If global warming turns the Panama Canal into a dry empty ditch, it won’t even be a shipping route anymore. A railway, perhaps? control as in managing or actual ownership. The ownership can be much murkier and less transparent than this. Read somewhere that from the 11 Trill managed by BlackRock only a fraction is in fact owned by the company. Is it true? CK Hutchinson Holdings is owned by the influential Li family. The patriarch, Li Ka-Shing, who is now retired was once known as the Superman of Asia and had deep links to the Communist Party of China. The Holdings company also still has a very substantial presence in Hong Kong (for example the ubiquitous Watsons shops) and Mainland China. I have a hard time reading this one, because the family knows that it has to stay on the right side of the Communist Party and if the later really wanted these ports, they could have one of the State Owned Companies gobble them ports up, so I think this sale was actually approved by the Chinese government and the next obvious question is to what purpose? To make some money before global warming makes the Panama Canal dry and worthless? ( Dumm Trump doesn’t ” believe in global warming ” so Dumm Trump could never imagine the Panama Canal running out of water). The headline is acrid male bovine faeces of the ilk agent orange loves spouting. BlackRock has not taken over the Panama Canal(s), it only purchased two out of the five port terminals in the country In order to do this BlackRock had to purchase 43 port terminals in a score of countries and seems to have overpaid for a package it cannot even operate because it lacks the expertise. Swiss based MSC will operate these terminals. BTW 38.000 US citizens did not die building the first Panama Canal, only a few hundred. Most were probably mormons who refused to live pissed on gin tonic. Point taken, Mangy Cat, and it’s an important one. Title has been changed. Thanks for the eloquent feedback. Thank you! Yellow fever – the major killer in Panama – is not listed as a disease treated by quinine at drugs.com. I don’t know if it has any such efficacy equivalent to that of malaria. Unlike its effect on plasmodium malariae, the parasite causing malaria, you are correct that quinine is not a treatment for yellow fever. However, like caffeine, quinine is a mosquito repellent, these critters being the vectors of both diseases. I have no data on the epidemiology while the US built the canal but during the De Lesseps venture both malaria and yellow fever were severe problems. In the generation between the French and US ventures the mosquito was found to be the vector. Together with the decision to build lacks rather than at sea level contributed to the success of the canal. Thank you, Nick. The Partnership on Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGI) link caught my attention. Some, but not all, of the private sector attendees are involved with the British government’s attempt to reboot, really privatise, the UK. Sometimes, a storied UK firm is invited as a token, like Schroders a fortnight or so ago, but these US giants are in the driving seat. This is why I think the UK will continue to triangulate between the EU and US. In addition, with an election defeat not unlikely in 2029, Labour politicians will need a golden parachute. They have to suck up to US big finance. There is no doubt in my mind that CK Hutchinson believe the have sold Blackrock a pig in a poke. I doubt they would have been allowed to make the sale by the CCP if the latter believed it was AT WORST geopolitically neutral. As Yves pointed out above, Panama is hurting badly for water, and China is better positioned to operate without the Canal. Expect to see more >Panamax ships sliding out of Chinese shipyards soon. Mexico launches Interoceanic Train service Trains More recently Sheinbaum dramatically increased funding: The story was different, however, for the Isthmus of Tehuantepec rail project, which seeks to develop an overland rail alternative to the Panama Canal [see “Mexico launches Interoceanic Train service,” Trains News Wire, Dec. 23, 2023]. Reflecting that project’s potential economic and logistic benefits, its funding saw a 703.5% increase, from 3.9 billion pesos ($190 million) to more than 31.5 billion pesos ($1.53 billion). Double tracking the line and running double stack container trains could easily handle several million containers a year with efficient sorting at either end. With Panama’s water problems, increased transit tolls and Blackstone running the ports, this project may have promise for Mexico. Thanks for bringing this up, upstater. We actually covered this story back in 2023. Have added a couple of additional paragraphs to this piece on the issue as well as a wee hat-tip in your direction. Since it is acknowledged that most of the fenanyl comes in by ship, does this mean Blackrock will face 25% tariffs unless they get it under control? In the medium and long run, if Chinese ships use the North East Route to reach the North Atlantic and then go down the eastern seabord of Americas, do theyyy even need the Panama Canal. What are the distances involved, and the dangers for chocking for one traditional route (passing the island chains around China into Pacific and then the Pacific into Panama and Atlantic) compared to the other (NER under Russian security umbrella then down to North Atlantic and so on? I have the feeling that Yves is quite right and Hutchinson Holdings is laughing on their way to the bank… Your email address will not be published.

Title: BlackRock First: How the World’s Largest Asset Manager is Gaining More Control Over America Under Trump

Editor Economy Bryan Lutz, Dollar Collapse “I hope we shall crush in its birth the aristocracy of our moneyed corporations, which dare already to challenge our government to a trial of strength and to bid defiance to the laws of their country.” ~ Thomas Jefferson Written by Bryan Lutz, Editor at Dollarcollapse.com: The corporate world is a fascinating one. Contrast it with the political one and you can find a new, curious perspective. Much of the political world pretends to own corporations, but in reality corporations tend to run the world. Here’s how it works: Governments like to regulate industries, make claims on natural resources, and force the ownership of certain operations. But in the end, it is the corporations that are producing the work. Governments do not produce. However, there is one trick governments use to claim some part in the production of real things… It is to claim ownership over the currency. Once the government becomes the person defining trade and the value of a currency they have much more control over what private corporations can and cannot do. They essentially make any demand they want because corporations must operate using their currency. But things change if one of these two things happen: Imagine if corporations started buying gold and then they put that gold on their balance sheet. Eventually, corporations would have a valid reason to start trading outside of the State currency. And then there’s the other radical alternative… Some corporations, Blackrock for example, are buying Bitcoin and other crypto to place it on their balance sheet. Recently, BlackRock made some interesting changes to their portfolio buying up a lot of Bitcoin for themselves, and investing in their own iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF during Bitcoin’s latest dip. BNN Bloomberg reports: BlackRock Adds Its Bitcoin ETF to Model Portfolio for First Time “The world’s biggest asset manager is finally allowing Bitcoin into its $150 billion model-portfolio universe. BlackRock Inc. is adding a 1% to 2% allocation to the $48 billion iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (ticker IBIT) in its target allocation portfolios that allow for alternatives, according to an investment outlook viewed by Bloomberg… …The move by BlackRock comes as Bitcoin prices crater alongside stocks, with a toxic brew of economic concerns and trade tensions weighing on risk appetite. The cryptocurrency is currently trading around $83,000, after reaching nearly $110,000 last month. Bitcoin’s famed volatility is a core reason why the asset manager mapped out a 1% to 2% weighting as a “reasonable range” in a December paper from the BlackRock Investment Institute. At the time it added that anything beyond 2% would sharply increase crypto’s share of overall portfolio risk.” Only a few days later, Trump announces a “Strategic Crypto Reserve.” And that launched Bitcoin back up another 10%. That is not only a favor for American freedom (as marketed to the public)… It is an effort on the US federal government’s part to control emerging currencies and therefore, the corporations that operate with them, but… Who really benefits from Trump’s Strategic Crypto Reserve? CNBC reports: Trump announces strategic crypto reserve including bitcoin, Solana, XRP and more “Cryptocurrencies rallied on Sunday after President Donald Trump announced the creation of a strategic crypto reserve for the United States that will include bitcoin and ether, as well as XRP, Solana’s SOL token and Cardano’s ADA. “A U.S. Crypto Reserve will elevate this critical industry after years of corrupt attacks by the Biden Administration, which is why my Executive Order on Digital Assets directed the Presidential Working Group to move forward on a Crypto Strategic Reserve that includes XRP, SOL, and ADA,” he said in a post on Truth Social. “I will make sure the U.S. is the Crypto Capital of the World.” “And, obviously, BTC and ETH, as other valuable Cryptocurrencies, will be at the heart of the Reserve,” he said in a follow-up post. “I also love Bitcoin and Ethereum!” XRP surged 33% after the announcement while the token tied to Solana jumped 25%. Cardano’s coin soared more than 60%. Bitcoin rose 10% to $94,343.82, after dipping to a three-month low under $80,000 on Friday. Ether, which has suffered some of the biggest losses in crypto year-to-date, gained 13%.” So who benefited from the Strategic Crypto Reserve the most? Those corporations that hold Bitcoin, and other cryptos… And those corporations that are also big enough to own a whole lot of real things. For example, Larry Fink’s BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager. BlackRock’s power, wealth, and control continue to grow to staggering heights. Here’s their most recent purchase… Bloomberg reports: BlackRock’s Ports Deal Marks New Reach, Hands Win to Trump “BlackRock Inc. led one of the biggest acquisitions of the year in a deal that marked both the firm’s expanded reach in infrastructure and a win for US President Donald Trump, who had raised concerns over control of key ports near the Panama Canal. The world’s biggest asset manager led a consortium that will buy a controlling stake in Panama ports that had become a political lightning rod and a larger unit that has operations across 23 countries. CK Hutchison, the conglomerate founded by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing, said it would receive cash proceeds of more than $19 billion from the sale. CK Hutchinson shares jumped as much as 25% in Hong Kong on Wednesday, the most in 27 years. The deal is a major victory for Trump, who had argued that China had taken over the critical waterway, without providing evidence, and that the US was paying too much for the passage of ships. He previously demanded the fees charged on US naval and merchant ships be lowered, or else Panama should return the canal to the US.” Can you see now? Trump’s “America First” policies and business like administrative style are putting corporations, especially BlackRock First. If you’re still not seeing what’s happening here… Bloomberg exposes: Fink Phoned Trump Directly to Pitch BlackRock’s Panama Deal “Donald Trump promised on Day 1 to seize the Panama Canal. “We’re taking it back,” the US president declared in his inaugural address. Within weeks, Wall Street billionaire Larry Fink was on the line with the White House. His pitch: Fink’s investment company, BlackRock Inc., was interested in buying the ports on either side of waterway, shifting them into American hands, according to people familiar with the discussion. And with that, there would be no need to have the US take the century-old canal by force. So went days of whirlwind negotiations that now are set to deliver control of those ports to a consortium led by BlackRock, the $11.6 trillion investment giant Fink has run for almost four decades.” Economy Economy Economy Receive the latest and greatest by subscribing to our newsletter

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us African venture capital firm Equator has raised $55 million for its first fund, which will back climate tech startups through one of the most difficult and often overlooked phases in their journey: the early stage. Climate tech startups in African countries have to navigate a tougher funding landscape than their counterparts in more developed economies, where governments often subsidize companies working on greener technologies. They have to instead rely heavily on development finance institutions (DFIs), foundations, and endowments, making them especially vulnerable to shifts in global capital flows. As aid and development finance budgets shrink, DFIs deploy less capital, which adds to the pressure on African startups. The situation is worse for climate tech companies, which require more capital than traditional tech startups. With its fund, Equator feels it can bridge this gap and back scalable solutions that can attract private capital. “We are needed more than ever to invest in technology and scalable ventures tackling fundamental climate challenges,” said the firm’s managing partner, Nijhad Jamal. “These investments will help reduce dependence on aid and instead bring more global private capital into the region.” That’s a lofty goal to aim for, but like many Africa-focused funds, Equator’s base of limited partners still is composed of the very institutions it aims to wean startups off. Its backers include DFIs such as British International Investment (BII), Proparco, and IFC, as well as foundations and endowments like the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet (funded by IKEA, Rockefeller, and Jeff Bezos’ Earth Fund) and the Shell Foundation. Equator plans to invest the fund in 15 to 18 startups, writing $750,000 to $1 million checks for companies at the seed stage and $2 million for those at Series A. Aside from capital, the firm wants to help founders figure out unit economics, governance, and regional expansion. The fund wants to also reserve capital for follow-on investments and later-stage rounds, and aims to mobilize its LPs as co-investors to bring in equity, debt, or blended financing. “In several of our portfolio companies, we’re the only Africa-focused investor on the cap table — that’s the role we see ourselves playing in this ecosystem,” Jamal said. “Until our most recent investments, we had a 100% success rate in bringing our investors directly into the ventures we backed.” Africa accounts for less than 3% of global energy-related CO2 emissions but bears some of the harshest climate impacts. Equator wants to address that, saying it invests in ventures “addressing economic and sustainability challenges emerging from these impacts.” When we covered the firm in 2023 after it had reached the first close for this fund, Jamal stressed the importance of backing technical founders building in the energy, agriculture, and mobility sectors. At the time, investments in climate tech had surged, making it Africa’s No. 2 VC sector after fintech. The market has changed since then, however, and investor conversations have evolved alongside those changes. Initially, founders and investors mainly focused on impact; now, Jamal says, the emphasis is shifting to sales — climate solutions must deliver clear economic value to customers with purchasing power. Listing examples of such solutions, Jamal pointed to electric vehicles that cost less than fuel-powered ones; climate insurance that accurately covers extreme weather; or AI-powered logistics optimization for businesses. Some of Equator’s portfolio companies, Roam Electric, Ibisa, and Leta, are building these solutions. “The narrative has shifted,” Jamal said. “It’s no longer just about development and impact. It’s about mobilizing private capital for scalable ventures that solve problems. The focus today is even more on things like unit economics and the path to profitability, because people know there isn’t just [enough] capital to throw at ventures to scale without thinking about monetization, real economics, profitability, or exits.” Jamal feels climate tech startups today are different from their first-generation clean tech counterparts like Sun King, M-KOPA, and d.light, which raised billions and are now looking ready for IPOs. These new startups, he said, operate in a more mature ecosystem, allowing them to use capital and time more efficiently — key factors in becoming attractive acquisition targets. Rather than billion-dollar IPOs, Jamal anticipates $100 million exits, saying that can still deliver strong returns for investors. The space is already seeing some consolidation, though most of it is undisclosed. We did see notable M&A, like Bboxx’s acquisition of PEG Africa in 2022, and more recently, Equator-backed SteamaCo merged with Shyft Power Solutions last year. As the sector hopes to see more exits, Jamal stressed the importance of capital structuring. Climate tech attracted the most debt financing last year, and he argues startups need the right mix to avoid excessive equity dilution. “If equity is used for everything, including working capital, dilution will be too high for investors or founders to see meaningful returns. But as debt and other financial instruments become more available, we’ll start seeing commercial exits, even if they’re more bite-sized,” he said. Jamal previously held roles at BlackRock and impact investor Acumen Fund, where he led the clean tech group. He later founded Moja Capital, a personal fund through which he made early-stage investments aligned with Equator’s current strategy. He runs Equator alongside partner Morgan DeFoort. One of Jamal’s early bets was SunCulture, a Kenya-based, off-grid solar company backed by the Schmidt Family Foundation, which Equator has since supported. Equator has also invested in other growth-stage startups like SoftBank-backed Apollo Agriculture and Odyssey Energy Solutions.

One of these was a solar module manufacturer named Solarium Green Energy, and the other a battery maker—Maxvolt Energy Industries—with the combined valuation at a modest $18 million. For context, 2024 saw a total of 14 listings in transition sectors. In the second half of the year alone, the Indian market saw transition IPOs worth over $2.3 billion. Bloomberg quoted unnamed sources as saying the immediate outlook for transition IPOs was not too bright, with bankers recommending valuations up to 30% lower than the numbers sought by company executives. “Growth is slowing,” Edward Lees, co-manager of BNP Paribas’ Emerging Markets Environmental Solutions fund, told Bloomberg. “People are just less tolerant of this idea of having to pay a green premium.” Also, Lees said, investors are paying more attention to the profitability of such companies now than they used to. In India specifically, there are also other problems that are turning into obstacles to IPO activity. One of these is failure on the part of alternative energy developers to secure long-term deals with buyers. Bloomberg again reported earlier this month that a growing number of wind and solar installations were having trouble securing offtake agreements with regional grid operators, as established by climate change outlet the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. As much as 35 GW worth of new projects were waiting to sign such offtake agreements with grid operators amid bureaucratic delays and expectations that wind and solar power prices would be on a consistent downward curve. Even so, the outlook, at least per BloombergNEF, is bright, with new installations this year expected to break a record.

Title: Eric Schmidt named CEO of a rocket startup. It could put him in competition with Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos.

Another billionaire has entered the rocket race. Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt has provided "substantial financial backing" and has become the CEO of rocket startup Relativity Space, its outgoing leader Tim Ellis said Monday. The company, which was the first to send 3D printed rockets into space, is building reusable flight hardware and has a long-term goal of building an industrial base on Mars. Schmidt, who led Google from 2001 until 2011 and was Alphabet's executive chairman until 2017, joins as the company aims to launch its Terran R launch vehicle in the next couple of years. The company said in a YouTube video posted Monday the vehicle is now in the design process. It launched its Terran 1 rocket in 2023, but it failed to reach orbit. Relativity Space declined to comment further when reached by Business Insider. "I know there's no one more tenacious or passionate to propel this dream forward," Ellis, also the cofounder of the company, said in an X post on Monday, adding that he'll transition to the company's board. Some of the company's eventual ambitions run parallel to those of Elon Musk's SpaceX and Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin. Under Schmidt's leadership, Relativity Space's rockets could compete with SpaceX's Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy and Blue Origin's New Glenn and New Shepherd rockets, as Relativity Space aims to create reusable rockets. The company, which was founded about a decade ago, is also known for using 3D printing to produce its rockets. In 2023, Relativity Space made history by sending the first rocket that was mostly 3D printed into space, though it did not reach orbit. The company has since expanded its focus beyond 3D printing and is also incorporating more traditional methods to produce its rockets. Relativity Space was valued at more than $4 billion in 2021, with investors that included BlackRock, Fidelity, and Mark Cuban. Jump to

Title: Panama Canal weighs pipeline to move gas, with eye on Asian clients

Business FILE PHOTO: An aerial view shows cargo vessels docked at Balboa Port, operated by Panama Ports Company, at the Panama Canal, in Panama City, Panama, February 1, 2025. REUTERS/Enea Lebrun//File Photo (C) By Elida Moreno PANAMA CITY : The Panama Canal is exploring the construction of a pipeline to move liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) across the trade passage, canal administrator Ricaurte Vasquez said on Monday, with Japan seen as a top potential client for gas coming from the U.S. WHY IT'S IMPORTANT The canal, one of the world's busiest maritime trade passages, is looking to diversify its operations after getting the greenlight in a court ruling last year. A drought limited crossings and canal officials are planning to build a reservoir nearby. Japan is one of the world's largest LPG customers, using the fuel for domestic and industrial use. KEY QUOTE "We're exploring the possibility of rolling out infrastructure with the capacity to move up to a million barrels per day (bpd), but the market is much larger," Vasquez told Reuters following a press conference. "Meeting the needs for growing volumes (of gas) through Panama is of the highest priority, but also of the highest complexity," Vasquez said. CONTEXT The move comes amid a backdrop of escalating tensions between the U.S. and Panama, sparked by U.S. President Donald Trump's claims about reclaiming the Panama Canal. Despite pushback from Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino against Trump's claims, the U.S. leader and officials have hailed a recent deal led by U.S. firm BlackRock to buy most of the ports business of Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison, including its assets near the Panama Canal. BY THE NUMBERS Initial studies show that "possible traffic capacity through the Panama Canal could reach 2 million bpd (of LPG) in a decade," Vasquez added. WHAT'S NEXT The canal expects to make a decision about the pipeline in the next 12 months, Vasquez said. Investments of $8 billion in infrastructure and sustainability projects are already earmarked for the canal, spread out over the next decade.

Title: ‘Worst-Case Scenario’: Canada Trades Trudeau For Another … Trudeau

Mark Carney, the newly elected Canadian Liberal Party leader positioned to succeed Justin Trudeau as Prime Minister, may impose familiar far-left policies to the nation already burdened by inflation and regulation, some critics warn. Carney, ex-central banker of the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England as well as the former UN Special Envoy on Climate Action and Finance, won his party’s support in a landslide victory Sunday. The new Liberal Party leader was recently appointed to head a Liberal task force on economic growth, with support from Trudeau, who resigned in January following years of economic trouble and a public dispute with President Donald Trump. (RELATED: Liberal Party Chooses Mark Carney As New Canadian PM As Trudeau Era Closes) “This is about a worst-case scenario for Canadians,” Marc Morano, the head of Climate Depot and author of “The Great Reset: Global Elites and the Permanent Lockdown” told the Daily Caller News Foundation. Morano cited concerns over how a Carney-led government would oppose the latest political and economic trends seen in Argentina, the United States and most recently, Germany, to instead “hammer consumers” and “double down on the green agenda.” “It’s as if he’s looked at the world the last five years and completely ignored reality,” Morano continued. Morano described Carney as “Justin Trudeau 2.0” and a “power player” that supports “corporate government collusion,” even comparing him to “BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, in terms of his power, expertise, connections and ability.” Canada’s Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre now faces a reinvigorated Liberal Party, though he’s led in the polls since October, according to CBC News. “Liberals are trying to trick Canadians into electing them for a fourth term by replacing Trudeau with his economic advisor, Mark Carney,” Poilievre said on X in response to Carney’s victory. Carney is a staunch supporter of green energy policies and has vowed to “reward Canadians for making greener choices, such as purchasing an energy efficient appliance, electric vehicle, or improved home insulation,” though he also promises to cut the country’s carbon tax, which has been described as “very unpopular,” according to a campaign press release. The Liberal Party leader has a long record of supporting green energy policies, even if they conflict with the flow of the free market. “Achieving net zero emissions will require a whole economy transition – every company, every bank, every insurer and investor will have to adjust their business models,” Carney said at the COP26 UN climate talks in 2020. “This could turn an existential risk into the greatest commercial opportunity of our time,” he claimed. “Canada’s current climate policy has become too divisive,” a press release from Mark Carney’s campaign also reads. “We need a climate policy that is unifying, credible, and predictable—to reduce emissions, drive investment, and build an economy for the future.” During his victory speech in Ottawa, Carney also said that “Donald Trump is trying to weaken [Canada’s] economy. But there’s someone else who, if he succeeds, will weaken our economy. It’s Pierre Poilievre. … A lifelong politician who worships at the altar of the free market despite never having made a payroll himself.” “Pierre Poilievre’s plan will leave us divided and ready to be conquered,” Carney continued. “Because a person who worships at the altar of Donald Trump will kneel before him, not stand up to him.” Carney has spoken out against Trump’s tariffs on Canadian imports, writing on X that they are “unjustified” on Thursday. The Trump administration argues that these tariffs are in response to the “flow of fentanyl” into the U.S. from Canada, further adding, “the situations at our Northern and Southern borders continue to require appropriate action from the Governments of Canada and Mexico.” Canada’s strong response to the unjustified US tariffs is having an impact. I am proud of the united front of workers, labour, businesses, federal and provincial governments that is helping Canada to navigate through this crisis. Today’s announcement is not enough. All tariffs… — Mark Carney (@MarkJCarney) March 6, 2025 “The world is absolutely going in the opposite direction from everything Carney stands for,” Morano said. He noted that Carney is “poised now to wreak this hellscape on Canadians,” potentially forwarding policies that will cause prices and restrictions to soar. “It’s easier to transition your gender than it is our energy supply,” Morano said. He asserted that clean energy power supply comes at a “higher cost, and it’s not green.” The author pointed to the fact that it takes 45 tons of non-renewable plastic to make one wind turbine. Morano also questioned green energy’s profitability, suggesting that if clean energy alternatives were profitable, green energy policies wouldn’t need to be mandated or subsidized. “Why do they have to ban the competition? … Why did you have to mandate them? Why did you have to subsidize them? Why are they the weakest points of energy output?” Justin Trudeau announced his resignation in January after nine years in office and a sharp decline in approval ratings. Since 2015, Canada’s national debt has nearly doubled, Bloomberg reported, prompting citizens’ increased discontent with the state of the economy. Canadians cited the cost of living as their biggest concern that they wanted members of Parliament in the next session to focus on, according to an Ipsos poll taken in September.

Title: Eric Schmidt joins Relativity Space as CEO | TechCrunch

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt is taking over as the CEO of Relativity Space, a 9-year-old rocket startup, a company spokesperson confirmed in a statement to TechCrunch. This is Schmidt’s first CEO job since he left Google nearly 15 years ago. On Monday, Schmidt told employees of Relativity Space that he made a significant investment and had taken a controlling stake in the company, The New York Times first reported. Schmidt is succeeding the startup’s co-founder, Tim Ellis, as chief executive. In a post on X, Ellis noted he will continue to support Relativity Space as a director on the company’s board. Schmidt is joining Relativity Space right as the company gears up for the 2026 launch of Terran R, a larger rocket than what the startup has launched before, that would compete with SpaceX’s Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy. In anticipation of Terran R’s first launch, Relativity Space has struck nearly $3 billion in launch contracts with customers, the Times reported. Schmidt was the CEO of Google for roughly 10 years. He was brought on to lead the rapidly growing search company in 2001, as Google’s board pressured its young founders, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, to allow an experienced business leader to take the reins. Now, Schmidt will become CEO of Relativity Space at a critical moment in the company’s history. He may offer the rocket startup both capital and experience to help guide it through the launch of Terran R. Additionally, Schmidt is quite well-connected in Washington, D.C., which could potentially assist Relativity Space in working with government officials on future launches. Relativity Space is known for producing its rockets with unusual techniques, including the use of 3D printers, automated robots, and artificial intelligence. The company previously announced a plan to launch the first private space mission to Mars by 2024. However, certain challenges have delayed those audacious milestones. In 2023, Relativity Space successfully launched its Terran 1 rocket, demonstrating that its 3D-printed technology could function effectively. However, Terran 1 failed to reach orbit. A month later, the startup announced that it would discontinue Terran 1 to focus entirely on developing the Terran R. The Long Beach-based rocket company reportedly faced cash shortages in 2024 and struggled to raise additional funding, Bloomberg previously reported. Previous investors in Relativity Space include Mark Cuban, BlackRock, and Fidelity. While running a rocket company is quite different from managing a search engine company, Schmidt has proven to be a valuable operator who can effectively grow startups in the past. With fierce competition in the space industry — from companies such as SpaceX, Rocket Lab, and Blue Origin — it seems Relativity Space could benefit from someone like Schmidt at the helm.

Shandong Yulong Petrochemical started up its first crude processing unit of 200,000 bpd in September 2024. This unit has kept crude processing rates at 90% of capacity since November. Now the refiner, whose refining and chemicals complex is worth $20 billion, is set to begin trial runs at the second crude unit of another 200,000 bpd at the end of March, according to the trading sources who spoke to Reuters. The new refining unit could raise crude oil imports in the world’s top crude buyer after recent slumps due to tepid domestic fuel demand. But more fuel production could also depress already weak refining margins in China and the region. Faced with a hectic reorganization of the crude trade following the U.S. sanctions on Russia, Shandong Yulong Petrochemical has reportedly boosted purchases of West African and Brazilian crude in recent weeks. The Chinese refiner last month bought four shipments of crude from Angola and Nigeria a trade source familiar with the deals told Reuters in February. Shandong Yulong Petrochemical booked a cargo each of Angola’s Dalia, Plutonio, and Girassol crude and one cargo of Nigeria’s Nemba, all for delivery in March. The Chinese refiner has also bought two shipments of crude from Brazil for delivery in April, according to the source. At the same time, China’s crude oil imports over the first two months of the year fell by 5% compared to the same period of 2024 as the parting round of sanctions that the Biden administration imposed on Russian energy affected international flows.

Sarah Healy Age: 24 Club: UCD Athletics Club The first time Sarah Healy heard Amhrán na bhFiann play out after her victory on the track, the assumption was she wouldn’t be waiting too long to hear it again. And she wasn’t, as two days after winning the 3,000m at the European Under-18 Championships in Gyor, Hungary in July 2018, Healy also won the 1,500m. Then came a series of near misses after running from the front – second in the 1,500m at the under-20 championships in 2019, second again at the under-23 championships in 2023, narrowly beaten by Sophie O’Sullivan – before some seven years later, Healy did get to hear Amhrán na bhFiann again after she won the 3,000m at the European Indoor Championships on Sunday. 🇮🇪☘️ Sarah Healy’s gold medal-winning moment in the 3000m. 🥹#Apeldoorn2025 pic.twitter.com/hy6pZy0nI4 It was a historic win for Irish athletics, Healy the first Irish woman to win gold at these championships which have been running since 1970, but it was deeply satisfying in a personal sense, given some of the setbacks she has endured. Healy choose to stay home rather than pursue a US scholarship, studying law at UCD while also adjusting to competing in the senior grade. Equally committed to her academics, graduating in 2023 with honours, she was by her own admission often prone to losing concentration in her races. In May 2022, she ran a world-class time of 4:02.86 for 1,500m at the at the World Athletics Continental Tour gold meeting in Ostrava, taking three seconds off Sonia O’Sullivan’s Irish under-23 record of 4:05.81 set 31 years previously in Monaco. But at the 2022 European Cross-Country Championships she suffered a bone stress fracture in her foot, requiring a lengthy lay-off. Still, Healy never lost her focus on where she wanted to go. After being carefully nurtured by her coach Eoghan Marnell at Blackrock AC, they realised the need to go beyond the big fish in the small pond scenario, and Healy moved to the husband-and-wife coaching team of Trevor Painter and Jenny Meadows, based in Wigan, whose group included Keely Hodgkinson, who won gold in the 800m at the Paris Olympics. There’s a newfound confidence and consistency about Healy’s running since, and nowhere was that more evident than in Apeldoorn on Sunday, where she held her nerve to hit the front for the first time inside the last 50m, right when it matters most. Mark English Age: 31 Club: Finn Valley AC They sometimes say your sport chooses you, not the other way around, and things might have been different had Mark English not been spotted winning the egg and spoon race at his school sports day in Letterkenny. For a while after English continued to focus on Gaelic football, playing with Letterkenny Gaels, encouraged by Colm McFadden – former All Star, current Donegal selector and one of English’s teachers at St Eunan’s College. English however soon realised his true potential was in athletics, particularly the 800m which requires that delicate combination of speed and endurance. Still he stayed close to Donegal football, standing in Hill 16 when they won the All-Ireland in 2012. That was the same year English lowered his 800m best to 1:45.77, the fastest under-20 time in Europe in 2012, just .17 shy of the Olympic A-standard for the London Olympics. Athletics Ireland choose not to nominate him on the B-standard, and at the time that hurt. Despite several enticing offers to take up a US scholarship, including at Villanova, English choose to stay at home, opting for UCD. Originally enrolling in physiotherapy, he later transferred to medicine, studying alongside Jack McCaffrey, where the talk was who might be the fastest in that class (Note: there would only be one winner). He won his first Irish senior title indoors in 2011, aged 17, and now, 14 years later and a qualified doctor, English has repeatedly broken the Irish 800m record indoors and out, and is still running stronger, faster, and more determined than ever. His bronze medal in the 800m on Sunday was his fifth European medal in all, making him the most decorated male athlete in the history of Irish athletics. Kate O’Connor Age: 24 Club: Dundalk St Gerards AC It was at the time seen as one small step for Irish athletics, and one giant leap for Kate O’Connor, who in winning the heptathlon silver medal at the European Athletics Under-20 Championships in Boras, Sweden back in 2019, first wrote her own little piece of history. No Irish woman had ever won a championship medal at any level in the heptathlon, the seven-event disciple demanding all-round talent and athleticism, and O’Connor had already made sure of it going into the final event, the 800m. The then 18-year-old from Dundalk St Gerard’s Athletics Club, coached by her father Michael, was racing to determine which colour, and in the end was rewarded with silver, her total of 6,093 points also smashing the existing Irish senior record, the first time any Irish woman had surpassed 6,000 points. O’Connor later won silver at the Commonwealth Games in 2022, representing Northern Ireland, and last summer in Paris became Ireland’s first representative in the Olympic heptathlon, finishing 14th. Still, Sunday’s bronze in the pentathlon – the indoor, five-event version of the women’s heptathlon – was another giant leap, given O’Connor jumped from fourth to third in the last event winning the 800m outright in 2:11.42. It was the first medal won by any Irish athlete in a senior multi-event. Her 800m time at was enough to bring the 24-year-old’s total to 4781 points, improving again on her previous Irish indoor record of 4683 set last month. Her father still oversees much of her training along with Tom Reynolds, and she’s currently dividing her time between Dundalk and Belfast, where she’s completing a Masters in Communications and Public Relations at Ulster University. The outdoor season and her return to the heptathlon now promises even more.

Title: Wall Street Is Quietly Hinting At Major Ideological Shift Toward Bitcoin This Year
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/danrunkevicius/2025/03/10/wall-street-is-quietly-hinting-at-major-ideological-shift-toward-bitcoin-this-year/
Time Published: 2025-03-10T13:32:49Z

ByDan Runkevicius ByDan Runkevicius , Senior Contributor. On his first day in office, Trump made a bold promise: Bitcoin will have regulatory clarity by midyear. Soon after, the Jan. 23 executive order followed, directing the nation’s top policymakers — from the Treasury secretary and SEC chair to the CFTC chair and attorney general — to find a way to integrate digital assets into the traditional financial system. Even ruling out edge cases like a full-fledged “national bitcoin reserve,” Trump’s wishlist, detailed in the order, marks the most aggressive pro-crypto push in Bitcoin’s history. And there’s already progress. Right after taking office, Trump’s appointed acting SEC chair, Mark Uyeda, revoked SAB 121, an accounting rule that forced banks to put crypto on their balance sheets, making custody impractical. What actually comes out of Trump’s pro-crypto push is still unclear, but Wall Street looks eager to call it a done deal. From financial advisor surveys and money flows to Wall Street’s recent investments, a mounting pile of data points to a major ideological shift about Bitcoin at an institutional level—one that goes beyond empty talk. On Jan. 14, 2024, the SEC approved spot Bitcoin ETFs, giving institutional investors a backdoor into Bitcoin. These funds solved three key problems that had kept big money on the sidelines: compliance, tax inefficiencies, and custody. For the first time, institutions could buy Bitcoin as easily as the S&P 500. The result is nearly $113 billion in inflows in under a year—representing about 10% of Bitcoin’s total market cap. Demand was so off the charts that Bitcoin outpaced every other asset class — including its ideological rival gold — becoming the fastest-growing ETF debut ever. In the first three trading days, Bitcoin ETFs pulled in $10 billion. For perspective, gold took nearly three years to hit that mark in the early 2000s. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas called it “insane.” Since its launch, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust — the first spot Bitcoin ETF — has collected $53 billion in assets, making it the fastest ETF to hit the $50 billion mark. “I wasn’t sure we’d ever see it, but I’ve never seen anything like it in my career, something going from $0 to $50 billion in basically six months,” BlackRock CFO Martin Small said earlier this month at the Goldman Sachs U.S. Financial Services Conference. Within their first year, Bitcoin ETFs have racked up more than $100 billion in assets. Considering that gold ETFs ended last month with $306 billion in assets, Bitcoin is already a third of the way toward matching gold in terms of ETF safe-haven demand. This isn’t just a retail-driven frenzy. According to SEC fillings, institutional ownership of Bitcoin ETFs has tripled over the last quarter from $12.4 billion to $38.7 billion. That’s in stark contrast to a 69% rise from retail investors, according to Fintel. Ironically, “institutions are perhaps the only investors that remain excited about cryptocurrency right now,” Nic Puckrin, founder of Coin Bureau, told me. And there may be good reason why. Not long ago, Wall Street slammed Bitcoin as the biggest fad in history. Warren Buffett famously called it “rat poison squared,” and JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon dismissed it as “worse than tulip bulbs.” But many fund managers who once wrote off Bitcoin have changed their tune. BlackRock and Fidelity have both issued Bitcoin ETFs. Fidelity added Bitcoin to employer-sponsored 401(k) accounts. Last year, Morgan Stanley became the first major Wall Street bank to allow its advisors to recommend Bitcoin ETFs to clients, while Goldman Sachs quietly bought up $1.6 billion worth of them. Yet, many money managers are still wary of Bitcoin. A 2024 CoinShares survey found that nearly two-thirds (62%) of financial advisors believe recommending Bitcoin conflicts with their fiduciary duty. That may soon change because Bitcoin is simply becoming too big to ignore. On a recent webinar, Cathie Wood called Bitcoin a promising new asset class that money managers now have “some fiduciary responsibility” to understand, even in its early stages. While the number of advisors actually allocating crypto to client portfolios remains small, it’s growing fast. The latest Bitwise and VettaFi survey found that 22% of financial advisors started allocating crypto in client accounts in the past year—twice the rate in 2023 and a record high for the poll. For context, that’s not far from gold. A recent Bank of America study found that 71% of U.S. financial advisors have little to no gold allocation, often keeping it below 1% of portfolios. Even BlackRock — the world’s largest asset manager — is making a case for Bitcoin as a portfolio diversifier akin to gold as the traditional stock-bond correlation continues to break down. “The erratic correlation between stock and bond returns has defined the new regime — and government bonds have become a less reliable cushion against equity selloffs as a result,” BlackRock analysts wrote. “We see the potential for other diversifiers — old like gold and new like Bitcoin — to step in.” As of today, all crypto held by institutional investors — including Bitcoin in ETFs and brokers that allow digital asset trading — is stored with crypto-native firms rather than traditional banks. Coinbase dominates this space. Of the 11 SEC-approved spot Bitcoin ETFs launched in January 2024, Coinbase serves as custodian for nine funds, controlling 86.4% of total ETF assets under management. That raises concentration risk, not to mention the fact that institutional investors remain wary of crypto-native firms, regardless of their size, given high-profile collapses like FTX and security breaches at firms like Bybit. To address this, Wall Street banks are stepping in to pick up the baton. Citi and State Street — the world’s second- and fourth-largest custodians — announced they will offer crypto custody services next year. This isn’t just another sign of crypto’s maturation. It’s also one of the biggest wins from recent regulatory shifts, including the revocation of SAB 121, a rule that forced banks to put digital assets on their balance sheets. Keeping assets off the balance sheet is what makes traditional asset custody safer and also more cost-effective. It reduces reserve requirements for custodians and lowers liquidation risk for asset owners if a custodian goes bust. “Asset managers have to put their assets with some sort of custodian, but with crypto, they do not currently have the ability to place large amounts in banks because of limitations like SAB 121,” according to a legal executive at a bank interviewed in an article by John Crabb for Institutional Investor. “If these limitations go away, asset managers will have more options — they could still use a non-bank custodian for crypto assets, but they would also have the choice of a chartered bank.” Another telltale sign of crypto’s evolution as an institutional asset is Wall Street’s willingness to become liquidity providers. Rumor has it that Citadel — the largest market maker on Wall Street — is preparing to enter the digital asset market. If true, it would be the first traditional market maker to provide liquidity in crypto. According to sources familiar with the matter, as first reported by Bloomberg, Citadel wants to join major exchanges, including Coinbase, Binance, and Crypto.com. This move follows Citadel’s 2023 initiative to bypass mainstream crypto exchanges — still deemed too risky for institutional investors due to regulatory uncertainty — and create its own institutional-grade crypto exchange. “Citadel Securities teamed up with brokerage firms, including Charles Schwab and Fidelity Investments, to form an institution-only crypto exchange that mirrors how assets are held and settled in stock and bond markets. That venue, EDX Markets, went live in 2023 and offers crypto trading exclusively for institutional investors,” wrote Katherine Doherty of Bloomberg. Out of fear of missing out, even the most conservative institutional investors are following suit. “Interestingly, several U.S. states are taking significant steps toward Bitcoin adoption, with pension funds in Michigan and Wisconsin already holding crypto, and Pennsylvania approving legislation to allocate up to 10% into Bitcoin,” Jason Yanowitz, a founder of Blockworks, told me. Wisconsin’s state pension fund recently doubled its Bitcoin ETF position to $320 million. Then there’s Michigan, with a $6.6 million investment in Bitcoin ETFs within its $143.9 million pension fund for state employees. Both allocations mark a significant share of their portfolios, substantially higher than BlackRock’s recommendation of a 1% to 2% allocation to Bitcoin. Endowments are also hopping on board. Last month, University of Austin announced a $5 million Bitcoin allocation within its $200 million endowment, marking the first dedicated crypto endowment fund in U.S. higher education. Sovereign wealth funds are hopping on the bandwagon, too. Just weeks ago, Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund, Mubadala Investment Company, revealed a massive $437 million stake in Bitcoin. It’s now the seventh-largest investor in BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, the world’s largest Bitcoin ETF by assets. Norway’s Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG) indirectly owned 2,446 BTC worth around $250 million at the end of the first half of 2024, more than double its holdings from the end of 2023. Then there’s the speculation about Trump’s Bitcoin national reserve. What Trump is proposing is similar to the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve, created after the 1973 Arab oil embargo. Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis has already introduced a bill suggesting the U.S. acquire 1,000,000 BTC over five years. It’s a long shot because buying Bitcoin means borrowing, which Trump is trying to avoid. What’s more likely is that he builds a de facto reserve out of the 200,000 BTC confiscated by the federal government, for which Trump signed an executive order last week. Any additional Bitcoin purchases would likely require congressional approval. Even a symbolic move — relabeling seized Bitcoin as a “reserve” — could spark what some economists call a global Bitcoin arms race, triggering another wave of institutional buying, only this time at the state level. No matter how big the push, Trump’s executive powers may not be enough to enact whatever he envisions, even if it’s as simple as reclassifying seized Bitcoin. Moish Peltz, a partner at Falcon Rappaport & Berkman, told CoinDesk after Trump’s victory that the rules surrounding seized Bitcoin might change on a department-by-department basis, depending on how it was confiscated. “Some portion of the seized Bitcoin might need an act of Congress, but not necessarily,” he said. “Trump’s pro-crypto stance has the potential to be a catalyst for transformation, but we need to separate the signal from the noise,” Yanowitz told me. “What the market needs to see moving forward is the administration continuing to push on the policy front.” Despite the uncertainty, the FOMO factor is already evident at the state level. There are already reports — though anecdotal — that other developed nations, including Japan, Russia and China, are actively considering to acquire Bitcoin ahead of a potential U.S. national reserve announcement. Meanwhile, while the Trump administration works on a federal Bitcoin reserve, 15 states — including Texas, Pennsylvania and Florida — are considering or have already introduced bills to add Bitcoin to their treasuries. Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming believes states will lead the way. “My bet is that you’ll see a state establish a Bitcoin strategic reserve before the federal government,” she said at a recent conference hosted by crypto personality Anthony Pompliano in New York, as reported by Bloomberg. At the end of the day, it’s uncertain whether institutions will hold their ground in the face of a broader market sell-off. But one thing is clear: Big money is throwing its weight behind Bitcoin as something that’s here to stay.

businessPersonal Finance By Javier E. DavidBusiness Editor Business Editor A growing number of Texans fear their golden years could turn to lead, with many feeling financially unprepared as retirement draws closer, BlackRock reported on Monday. In a new survey, the world’s largest asset manager found retirement security fears “consume” many in the Lone Star State. Out of about 500 respondents surveyed, BlackRock found that 78% are concerned that the system is leaving too many Americans without sufficient savings to live in old age. About 62% of Texans reported having under $150,000 in retirement savings, BlackRock said. Meanwhile, a slim 22% of employed Texans felt “very confident” in having enough money to last through retirement, the data showed, while nearly half are more concerned about going broke during their golden years than they are dying.

Or with: By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy BlackRock’s findings are consistent with a body of evidence showing widespread retirement insecurity, especially with the solvency of Social Security a big question mark as more depart the workforce. Costlier living expenses driven by inflation have exacerbated the problems. In a 2021 report, the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas found that Texas “has a high share of population groups that tend to struggle with retirement savings,” including low-wage workers, people of color (specifically Hispanics) and rural residents. The data suggests that Americans in general — and Texans in particular — “are not as prepared as they need to be for retirement,” the Dallas Fed’s researchers wrote. For those over 45, available figures show that average retirement account balances lag far behind levels considered comfortable enough to retire. BlackRock’s survey respondents felt $2.1 million was the magic number they’d need to live comfortably after retiring; however, not even 30% have personally stocked away enough to do so. The problem is growing more acute, as more Baby Boomers retire and the first wave of Generation X turns 60 in 2025 — with retirement not far off. According to Fidelity data, Baby Boomers are considered the most financially secure, with the average 401K balance at $249,000, with the average individual retirement account carrying a balance of about $257,000. But for Gen X, reality is starting to bite. The average 401K for that cohort is just over $192,000, according to Fidelity, with the average IRA barely over $100,000. BlackRock found that among the Texans they surveyed, Gen Xers were indeed the most anxious, with 60% having under $150K in retirement savings. Half of voters in Texas between the ages of 55 and 64 have under $50,000 saved for retirement, the firm noted.

“Everything is bad and will get worse” – Ukraine Serviceman to British Media By Ahmed Adel, March 09, 2025 Ukraine’s Armed Forces have lost the initiative on the battlefield, and even with the resumption of US military aid, the Ukrainians would have little chance of stopping the Russian army’s advances. More Guns, Less Butter: Starmer’s Defence Spending Splash By Dr. Binoy Kampmark, March 09, 2025 Spend, spend, spend is the theme, and the UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has shown himself willing to join this wasteful indulgence. On February 25, just prior to his visit to Washington, Starmer announced that spending on defence would reach 2.5% of GDP from April 2027. German Elections – With Some Highlights of President Trump’s State of the Union Address By Peter Koenig, March 09, 2025 On 23 February 2025 advanced elections were held in Germany towards a new Government, as the old Government coalition, the so-called “Traffic Light” – red (Social Democrats), yellow (Free Democratic Party), green (The Greens) – collapsed in early November 2024. This had been expected for some time. The advanced snap elections were no surprise. Recycling ‘Russiagate’ in Romania By Drago Bosnic, March 09, 2025 Romania has been going through unprecedented instability in the last several months, with the Brussels-run neoliberal dictatorship effectively taking over the country. It could even be described as a “soft coup” orchestrated to nullify the will of the Romanian people. Hamas, Palestine, and Israel By Dr. Vladislav B. Sotirović, March 09, 2025 In essence, any economic prosperity of Palestine directly depends on political relations between Israel and the Palestinian authorities. The Israeli general embargoes are more or less constant and, therefore, limit the available natural resources and economic potentials to be properly used, causing starvation and dehumanization of the Palestinians. Agent Zelensky, Ukraine on Sale. Manlio Dinucci By Manlio Dinucci, March 09, 2025 In 2021 Zelensky, overwhelmed by huge economic problems, changed the law preventing the sale of Ukrainian land and resources to foreign companies. So it was that half of Ukraine’s precious black earths and mineral resources ended up in the hands of Monsanto, Cargill, Dupont, controlled by big US funds including BlackRock, Vanguard and Blackstone. RFK Jr. and Federal Health Agencies Wisely Oppose Mass H5N1 Animal Vaccination Over Mutation Concerns By Nicolas Hulscher, March 09, 2025 America has public health leadership that uses common sense and the most up-to-date science. Mass animal depopulation for H5N1 bird flu prevents population immunity, while widespread vaccination would accelerate viral evolution—prolonging the crisis, destabilizing the food supply chain, and increasing the risk to humans.

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough , Senior Contributor. 03/10 update below. This post was originally published on March 09 Bitcoin and crypto prices—including ethereum, Ripple’s XRP, solana’s SOL and cardano’s ADA—have flat-lined over the last week after Donald Trump revealed the cryptocurrencies that the U.S. was betting on, sparking market mayhem. Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has fallen back to around $85,000 per bitcoin, exactly where it was at the beginning of March (despite China quietly priming the bitcoin price for a major earthquake). Now, as Elon Musk issues a surprise crypto price warning, Donald Trump’s crypto czar has said the U.S. Treasury will be working to “maximize the value” of the bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies held by the U.S. in its reserve and crypto stockpile. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run President Donald Trump has said he plans on making the U.S. the world's bitcoin "superpower" as the ... [+] price of cryptocurrencies XRP, solana, cardano and ethereum brace for huge shock. “We’re going to move the [cryptocurrency owned by the U.S. government] to the digital stockpile,” David Sacks, a technology investor and entrepreneur who has joined the Trump administration as artificial intelligence and crypto czar, said on the All In Podcast he cohosted before taking the job. “The purpose of the stockpile is responsible stewardship, it’s a place for safekeeping, it’s a centralized account under the direction of the secretary of the Treasury and the secretary of the Treasury will figure out how to maximize the value of these holdings.” 03/10 update: The bitcoin price has dropped to $80,000 per bitcoin over night before rebounding slightly but fresh fears have emerged that bitcoin could be headed to around $70,000—at which point things "will be violent," according to BitMex founder and crypto investor Arthur Hayes. “With bitcoin dipping below $80,000, approximately 70% of all selling came from investors who bought within the last three months, highlighting the dominance of recent entrants panic-selling into the decline,” Markus Thielen, the chief executive of market advisory company 10x Research, said in an emailed note. The rest of the crypto top ten have followed bitcoin lower, with ethereum hitting $2,000 for the first time since late 2023. Ethereum rival solana and the meme-based dogecoin are leading the market lower, each down around 6%. "In the short-term, expect bitcoin to drop as low as $72,000 and ethereum to hit $1,600 while the administration seeks to control inflation," Zach Burks, the chief executive of non-fungible token (NFT) service provider Mintology, said in emailed comments. “Many investors are pulling out of bitcoin, viewing it as a risky asset class for the first time since Trump took the White House. It’s no longer playing its role as a store of value—gold prices have spiked as many go back to the original ‘doomsday asset,’ which is no surprise as tariffs and grenades continue to get thrown across the free world.” This week, after Trump’s surprise announcement that Ripple’s XRP, solana and cardano would form the basis of a U.S. crypto reserve, the White House has shuffled its plans to create a bitcoin-only strategic reserve alongside a crypto stockpile made up of smaller cryptocurrencies including ethereum, Ripple’s XRP, cardano and solana. "The crypto stockpile should be subject to good portfolio management and fortunately we have a secretary of the Treasury who is an extremely successful former hedge fund manager so he’s going to figure out the best way to manage these assets and we give him the flexibility to do portfolio management," Sacks said. Speaking at the much-hyped White House crypto summit this week, alongside Sacks and Treasury secretary Scott Bessent, Trump confirmed his commitment to bitcoin—placing it in a unique position above other cryptocurrencies in a reserve described as a “digital Fort Knox” in a reference to the U.S. gold reserve. “I promised to make America the bitcoin superpower of the world and the crypto capital of the planet,” Trump said, it was reported by the New York Times. “We’re taking historic action to deliver on that promise.” In July, then Republican candidate Donald Trump promised to create a "strategic national bitcoin reserve" and predicted bitcoin could eclipse gold’s near-$20 trillion market capitalization during an appearance at the Bitcoin 2024 conference. During Friday’s White House summit, Trump also called it "foolish" of the government to have previously sold so much of its seized bitcoin, while Sacks, speaking on the podcast, claimed the U.S. might have lost as much as $16 billion by selling off its bitcoin. "At one point in time, we had about 400,000 bitcoin on the federal balance sheet. We sold roughly half of that for something like $360 million total," Sacks said during the podcast. "If we had held all of that, just that the portion we sold would be worth over $17 billion." Ahead of the summit, Trump signed an executive order calling for the creation of the bitcoin reserve and crypto stockpile using existing government holdings, disappointing traders with a lack of commitment to new bitcoin and crypto purchases though leaving the door open to acquiring more bitcoin though “budget neutral” methods that “do not impose incremental costs on United States taxpayers." Sacks added during a press conference that the Treasury and Commerce department, led by bitcoin price bull Howard Lutnick, are only “allowed to buy more if it doesn't add to the deficit or the debt.” Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has dipped from the peak it reached after Donald Trump's election victory, ... [+] dragging down the price of ethereum, XRP, solana, cardano and the wider crypto market. “The subpar strategic bitcoin reserve move triggered the uncertainty in the crypto market,” Agne Linge, head of growth at crypto platform WeFi, said in emailed comments. “With the executive order directing agencies to consolidate seized bitcoin to form the reserve, crypto investors see the move as a trick, as no new bitcoin purchase was announced. Despite the knee-jerk reaction from investors, the fact is that the bitcoin reserve mandate authorizes the acquisition of bitcoin through means that will not cost taxpayers’ money. The available options in this regard include bitcoin bonds and the sales of its gold reserve to fund more purchases. In the long term, the bitcoin reserve shift might benefit the coin. This thesis hinges on a possible race it has triggered that may see other sovereign nations make similar moves.” Some have speculated that China is weighing the creation of its own bitcoin reserve to rival the U.S. after Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund revealed last month it’s betting on bitcoin, kicking off a global adoption “race." “The U.S. bitcoin reserve raises the likelihood of other nations adopting similar reserves and accelerates their consideration of such initiatives,” analysts with Tagus Capital wrote in an emailed note. “With the U.S. planning to adopt bitcoin reserves, this is likely to drive broader global adoption, with more nations integrating bitcoin into their reserves—potentially shifting from gold to digital assets, much like how some economies have embraced the U.S. dollar alongside or instead of their own currencies.”
