More Info BlackRock expects the AI boom and data centers to drive a 50% jump in energy consumption in the Asia Pacific region over the next decade, a senior executive at the world’s largest asset manager said on Wednesday. “The need for data centers over the next five years is going to be double what is currently in the markets,” Brad Kim, BlackRock’s Asia Pacific managing director for global infrastructure funds, told a media briefing, as carried by Bloomberg. “[O]verall energy consumption will increase by about 50% in the next 10 years across Asia Pacific,” the executive added. Technology giants have already started to secure long-term power contracts in Asia, where electricity and overall energy demand are rising and will rise more than previously expected, due to the demand for data centers and AI development. Last month, Microsoft signed a deal to buy all the solar power from a project in Singapore as the tech giant seeks to achieve its goal of having 100% of its electricity consumption, 100% of the time, matched by zero-carbon energy purchases by 2030. Microsoft has signed an agreement with EDP Renewables, a Spain-based company, to buy 100% percent of the renewable energy exported to the grid from EDP Renewables’ SolarNova 8 project in Singapore. Asia will present huge opportunities for investment in infrastructure, including in energy infrastructure, as the AI boom unfolds, BlackRock says. “Every client we speak to is interested in investing in infrastructure, specifically energy transition and digital related infrastructure,” Charlie Reid, head of APAC renewable power investments at BlackRock, said, as quoted by Bloomberg. Earlier this month, BlackRock, Global Infrastructure Partners, Microsoft, and MGX launched a new AI partnership to invest in data centers and support power infrastructure. The partnership will initially seek to unlock $30 billion of private equity capital over time from investors, asset owners, and corporates, which in turn will mobilize up to $100 billion in total investment potential when including debt financing. “Mobilizing private capital to build AI infrastructure like data centers and power will unlock a multi-trillion-dollar long-term investment opportunity,” said Larry Fink, Chairman and CEO of BlackRock.

Title: BlackRock records $158 million inflows across Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs

BlackRock’s IBIT ETF leads Bitcoin inflows with $98.9 million while smaller ETFs remain flat. On Sept. 24, Bitcoin ETFs recorded a substantial inflow, totaling $136 million, driven primarily by BlackRock’s IBIT ETF, which saw an inflow of $98.9 million, marking the most significant movement of the day. Bitwise’s BITB ETF added $17.4 million, while Fidelity’s FBTC contributed $16.8 million. Grayscale’s smaller BTC ETF reported a modest inflow of $2.9 million, with GBTC flat. Other ETFs, including those from Ark, Invesco, Franklin, Valkyrie, VanEck, and WisdomTree, showed no activity, maintaining flat flows. Ethereum ETFs experienced notable inflows, totaling $62.5 million. BlackRock’s ETHA ETF led the inflows with $59.3 million, suggesting a renewed interest in Ethereum exposure from institutional investors. VanEck’s ETHV and Invesco’s QETH ETFs also saw smaller inflows of $1.9 million and $1.3 million, respectively. All other Ethereum ETFs reported no flow changes, including those from Fidelity, Bitwise, 21Shares, Franklin, and both of Grayscale’s funds. The significant inflows into Bitcoin ETFs, especially from BlackRock, contrast with the more measured but positive inflows into Ethereum ETFs, indicating a broad-based accumulation trend with stronger momentum toward Bitcoin products.

Title: Sam Altman believes wars will be fought over AI unless there's massive spending on infrastructure. But that comes with a cost.
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/openai-sam-altman-infrastructure-artificial-intelligence-data-centers-2024-9
Time Published: 2024-09-25T09:22:02Z
Full Content:
In a Monday blog post, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman argued that massive investment in AI infrastructure is key to market dominance — and avoiding global conflict. "If we want to put AI into the hands of as many people as possible, we need to drive down the cost of compute and make it abundant (which requires lots of energy and chips)," Altman wrote. "If we don't build enough infrastructure, AI will be a very limited resource that wars get fought over, and that becomes mostly a tool for rich people." While promoting the development of AI infrastructure is the new focus of industry leaders like Altman, researchers on the technology's social, environmental, and economic impacts told Business Insider that the development of the data centers and hardware systems needed to achieve artificial general intelligence or superintelligence will cost far more than money. Representatives for OpenAI did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. The new hot topic in artificial intelligence is infrastructure — investing in it, planning a massive expansion of computing power, and creating the data centers needed to develop the technology at scale. Last week, Microsoft and BlackRock announced the launch of a $30 billion fund to "enhance American competitiveness in AI while meeting the growing need for energy infrastructure to power economic growth." Earlier this month, the White House hosted a roundtable with AI infrastructure leaders from around the country — including Altman and executives from Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Anthropic, among others — to "discuss steps to ensure the United States continues to lead the world in AI" and ensure the tech's development is aligned with "national security, economic, and environmental goals." While some experts are cautiously optimistic about AI, others pointed to pitfalls in the rapid build-up of infrastructure. Alex de Vries, an economist and the founder of Digiconomist, a platform dedicated to exposing the unintended consequences of digital trends, told Business Insider the current conversation on AI infrastructure is focused on the development of large-scale data centers, with industry insiders trying to convince national governments to greenlight expansion — despite unclear benefits. "It costs a whole lot of resources, while data centers don't generate that many benefits for the local economy — not too many jobs, very little other business activity because no one has to be near a data center," de Vries said. "So for now, the trade-off is really bad." The return on investment in artificial intelligence is increasingly murky. With companies like OpenAI and others preparing to spend over $1 trillion on artificial intelligence in the coming years, a June Goldman Sachs report asked the question: "Are we spending too much for too little reward?" Proponents of the technology argue it could eventually help save lives by revolutionizing the healthcare industry or, as the United Nations climate technology website suggests, "scaling up transformative climate solutions for mitigation and adaptation action in developing countries." However, chatbots and image generators have been the most publicly celebrated advancements in AI from the major Big Tech players — and errors created by AI-generated content have been well documented. In recent earnings calls, executives from Microsoft and Alphabet have repeatedly fended off investors' questions about when to expect a return on their AI expenditures. Shaolei Ren, an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of California, Riverside, told Business Insider that, despite Altman's prediction in his blog post that we could be "a few thousand days" from an AI superintelligence, he's not optimistic that we're as close as Altman says we are — and he argued OpenAI's reliance on large language models is not the right path to get there. Rather than a single model that can do it all, Ren said he believes the industry needs to focus on smaller, more specialized models that require fewer resources and can be built to handle more precise tasks. "I think we need to shift the way we build AI, not just rely on bigger and bigger models," Ren said. "This is not really sustainable or scalable." Both de Vries and Ren said that beyond the financial costs, ensuring AI infrastructure is developed at the scale industry players like Altman seek comes with massive environmental costs. "If you're talking about large-scale data centers, they are going to be consuming a huge amount of power and a huge amount of water," de Vries said. He noted that data centers consume tons of water for their cooling systems — some of which evaporates, so it cannot be reused. Electricity consumption also skyrockets, driving up demand and increasing reliance on fossil fuels despite the industry's use of renewable energy certificates (RECs). Wind and solar companies generate RECs for each unit of energy they create and then sell them. Buyers of RECs can then say they source renewable energy, even if they're using power from nonrenewable sources. "The environmental consequences of a big surge in power demand are typically very, very bad — way, way worse than is being acknowledged by the Big Tech companies," de Vries said. That's not to mention what Cary Coglianese, a professor of law and political science and the director of an interdisciplinary program focused on research on effective regulation at the University of Pennsylvania, describes as AI's impact on "social ordering." While Coglianese describes himself as "cautiously optimistic" about the benefits of artificial intelligence, he said even if we achieve advanced uses for the tech, the feat will come with "trade-offs." "Any human endeavor that involves an optimization challenge can be made more efficient through artificial intelligence," Coglianese said. "Some of those uses can be good, like finding malignancies on MRI scans — a great use of AI technology — but we'll also be making much more efficient weapon systems, or automating weapon systems, or creating tools that can oppress people that can be made more, quote-unquote, 'efficient.'" In his blog post, Altman writes that the dawn of what he calls the Intelligence Age comes "with very complex and extremely high-stakes challenges." "It will not be an entirely positive story," Altman wrote. "But the upside is so tremendous that we owe it to ourselves, and the future, to figure out how to navigate the risks in front of us." Altman didn't mention the current negative social impacts AI is already causing — such as deepfakes infiltrating our political system, a proliferation of AI-generated revenge porn, and workers being replaced as companies increasingly invest in the tech. "There's a real disconnect between where the world is today socially and where it is technologically — and that's something that the technologists and the techno-optimists can often overlook," Coglianese told Business Insider. "I'm cautiously optimistic too, but we have to recognize that until we have a social ordering that's different than it is, a new technology won't be some magic elixir that will transform the globe into a utopia."

Title: Meet the ex-Goldman wealth advisor who quit to solve Britain’s £567 billion gender investment gap
URL: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/25/ex-goldman-director-quit-to-solve-uks-gender-investment-gap-.html
Time Published: 2024-09-25T07:08:20Z

Related Stories Ayesha Ofori is a former Goldman Sachs wealth advisor who quit her high-profile job to resolve Britain's gender wealth gap, after realizing she had spent her career making rich men even richer. Ofori is the 40-year-old founder and CEO of female-focused financial investment platform, Propelle, which launched on Wednesday. The app-based platform offers various investment options like funds from Vanguard, Blackrock and HSBC. Propelle has raised over £1.2 million (around $1.6 million) in pre-seed funding and is backed by Google, which invested $100,000 into the platform, Ofori told CNBC Make It in an interview. Other investors range from Stefan Bollinger, Julius Baer CEO and former Goldman executive, to Lucy Demery, managing director of fintech investments at Barclays. Ofori, who had worked at Goldman for six years, and handled just over £500 million in client money, said she typically worked with entrepreneurs and first-time founders who built highly profitable businesses and sold them for a lot of money. However, despite breaking the glass ceiling as a Black woman in finance, she wasn't satisfied. "I had gotten to a point in my career where things were going amazingly well," Ofori said. "I was promoted to executive director, and I started to bring in lots of money. I hit that half a billion threshold. That's the threshold they tell you to aim for. I passed that." Ofori recalled sitting in a meeting with one of her bosses and reflecting on what the next six to 10 years looked like for her. "I realized it's just more of the same ... I'd lost my sense of purpose every day. It was almost getting monotonous," she said. "It really shouldn't have taken six years to hit me, but I remember one day I woke up and I was just like 'I make incredibly rich men richer, that's what I do, day in, day out,'" she added. Ofori said she began questioning the dearth of women in investing. "I found that across the board, women, overwhelmingly, were not investing anywhere near the levels men were." Despite women living on average longer than men, "we have less money that isn't being put to work in the way that it should," she said. Britain's gender investment gap currently stands at £567 billion — an increase of £54 billion between January 2023 and January 2024 — according to data from British financial research company Boring Money which surveyed over 6,000 adults in the U.K. It found that men have £1.01 trillion invested compared with £450 billion for women. Additionally, the latest data from Prospect, a British union representing 157,000 professionals across industries like tech, education, transport and legal, found that the gender pensions gap stood at 37.9% between 2021 and 2022 — more than double the gender pay gap, which was reported as 14.9% in 2022. The gender pensions gap refers to the differences in retirement income or retirement wealth between men and women. Ofori said she was stunned by the statistics she found, and this led her on a path to quitting her well-paid executive role at Goldman in 2018, and embarking on a mission to empower women financially. Ofori said that the women she spoke to were more inclined towards saving, and mistakenly believed that placing their money in a cash Individual Savings Account (ISA) was a form of investing. An ISA is a high-interest, tax free, individual savings account in the U.K. which has an annual allowance of £20,000. "Saving and investing are not the same thing, and the two words are used interchangeably often. That annoys me, because they're not the same, and women naturally default to saving and they save thinking they're investing," Ofori said. She added: "With all the best will in the world, you may think you've invested because you've put your money in a cash ISA, but you are not going to hit your goal." Research shows that women are more hesitant about investing. Almost half of women globally feel that investing in the stock market via an individual security or a fund is too risky, a 2022 BNY Mellon Investment Management report that surveyed 8,000 men and women across 16 countries found. And only 28% of women felt confident about investing their money. There are two key reasons that women are locked out of the investing bubble, according to Ofori: a lack of time and confidence. "The first thing is a lot of women tell us they don't know where to start. There's too much information. It's too overwhelming and they don't have time to sit there and figure it out," she said. "So rather than make a mistake, they just don't do anything." Before she left Goldman, Ofori started throwing events for women in London in order to share her story of building wealth for herself and clients — and, within a few months, 2,000 women were signing up to attend. "I realized that I was onto something," she said. "Just because women haven't been investing doesn't mean they don't want to invest. They clearly do." Ofori noticed that attendees to her events were put off by regular investing platforms and didn't know where to start. "The way that the platforms portrayed information and the way that the investments were structured didn't relate with how women think about investing and building their wealth," Ofori said. That's when she decided that she was going to build an FCA regulated multi-asset class investment platform for women. "I know that now my purpose is to help women build wealth," Ofori said. Women who spoke with Ofori about their investing journey often complained about regular investing platforms typically being male-centric. Factors that are off-putting for women include the language used, a lack of transparency about the different levels of investment risks and the funds not relating to their personal goals. "Most, if not all of those platforms were run by men, and their teams were overwhelmingly men so when you're thinking about the teams who are designing products, there are going to be natural inherent things in them that they're building them with men in mind ... the data speaks for itself, if you look at the customers of these companies, they're majority men," Ofori said. In contrast, Propelle is rolling out features in the coming weeks such as a risk assessment tool which explains the different types of risks involved, as well as measuring users' personal risk tolerances. Its smart goal setting feature will allow users to invest in funds with different risk levels based on whether those goals are long-term or short-term. Propelle also has investing options that are based on users' personal values from sustainability to Shariah-compliant funds. It eventually plans to add alternative investments such as fractionalized real estate, startup investing and wine and art investing. "I didn't want to build a platform where women were just investing in things just because it's there and it's not working for them. We really made an effort to make sure that it's suitable for the woman based on whatever background that she has," Ofori said. "Just because, you might have a smaller amount of money, why should you be excluded to asset classes that the rich have been investing in for years, making tons of money? It's obvious why the rich keep getting richer." Get Make It newsletters delivered to your inbox Learn more about the world of CNBC Make It © 2024 CNBC LLC. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Column-German relapse trolls European 'soft landing': Mike Dolan
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/columngerman-relapse-trolls-european-soft-landing-mike-dolan-3631182
Time Published: 2024-09-25T06:05:59Z
Full Content:
By Mike Dolan LONDON (Reuters) -Even as U.S. markets reasonably bask in "soft-landing" hopes - a fresh downturn in Europe's biggest economy raises more serious questions on the eastern side of the Atlantic. The weakness of German industry can hardly be a big surprise to anyone who has been paying attention. The past two years have featured Ukraine-related energy shocks, intensified Chinese competition in the auto sector, a fumbling attempt to break into electric vehicles and a painful borrowing squeeze. For ING economist Carsten Brzeski, following German macro data is "like a long stroll on the boulevard of broken dreams." But even by the standards of the past couple of years, the latest news is alarming. Although Germany's economy showed tentative signs of recovery earlier this year, the country's business surveys in September point to a relapse. This is largely due to stumbling China, Germany's largest trading partner and with whom it exchanged a quarter of a trillion euros worth of imports and exports last year. Germany's manufacturing sector appears to be in deep contraction yet again, according to both S&P Global's reading and the homespun Ifo survey. S&P Global's index combining both factory and service sectors suffered the deepest downturn in seven months in September. Ifo's manufacturing index cratered to its lowest point since the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns in June 2020. Germany's top economic institutes are now set to downgrade their full-year 2024 forecast to show gross domestic product shrinking 0.1%, which would mark a second consecutive annual contraction. That sort of shallow recession might not yet be a "hard landing" per se - and Germany's euro zone peers are doing better. But it shakes faith in whatever might be defined as a "soft" touchdown. The European Central Bank is offering some help, with two interest rate cuts already in the books this year. But its moves have been in smaller clips than the jumbo cut unloaded by the Federal Reserve last week and there appears to be foot dragging in Frankfurt's "Eurotower" about the pace of further reductions. POLITICAL FOOTBALL Despite the business fug, you'd be hard-pressed to find much angst in headline German market metrics. Blue-chip German stocks hit record highs last week. And even though unhelpful for struggling German exporters, the euro is close to its best levels in two years against the dollar - with its real effective exchange rate index close to the highest in a decade. Where you're more likely to see "hard-landing" worries reflected is in the widening credit spreads - or risk premiums - on high-yield bonds. While so-called junk bonds benefit from interest rate cuts, the impact is modest in comparison to the hit they typically take from earnings weakness and recession-fueled default fears. But - just like their U.S. equivalents - euro "junk" bond spreads are close to the narrowest they've been since the Ukraine invasion and the ECB tightening of early 2022. The elephant in the room is the auto sector - estimated to account for about 7% of the European Union's GDP and even more in Germany. As BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s credit team pointed out, that sector represents about 6% of the Bloomberg Pan-European Investment Grade debt index and almost 11% of the high-yield equivalent. And dour returns make it among the worst-performing sectors both this month and in the current quarter. JPMorgan's European credit team earlier this month said it has been underweight autos all year, citing "significant headwinds" from lower-cost Chinese rivals and energy problems. And it's been another rough month for Germany's "champions," with Volkswagen (ETR:VOWG_p)'s unprecedented plan to shut factories on its home turf and a BMW (ETR:BMWG) profit warning that sent its share price plummeting. Both companies blamed a mix of Chinese competition and rising labour and energy costs in an industry that's clearly ailing more broadly. The STOXX 600 Autos and Parts share index has underperformed the wider market by some 15% this year. As JPMorgan's team note: "The sector has become one of the main political footballs in the emerging global trade war." China's latest stimulus measures this week may shift the demand picture a bit, and German auto shares did get a lift on Tuesday. But with U.S. elections nearing and escalating tariff wars and protectionism now a constant threat, it seems unlikely that the drag on the German industrial world will dissipate anytime soon. It's tough to see how Germany stops sputtering - whether it can be just contained to autos is a bigger question. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.

Title: BlackRock Bitcoin, Ethereum ETFs notch $158 million net inflows amid market recovery

Share this article BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Ethereum Trust (ETHA) collectively drew in around $158 million in net inflows on Tuesday amid a crypto market recovery that saw Bitcoin surge past $64,000. According to data tracked by Farside Investors, the IBIT fund logged approximately $99 million in new capital, bringing its total net buying since launch to $21 billion. IBIT made a strong performance after a period of stagnation with minimal inflow days reported, several days of no flows, and some bleeding days. Tuesday’s gain marked IBIT’s largest single-day inflow since August 23. Competing funds managed by Fidelity and Bitwise also posted gains of around $17 million each on Tuesday while Grayscale’s Bitcoin Mini Trust took in nearly $3 million in net inflows. No flows were reported from other ETFs. With IBIT’s massive inflows and additional capital into other funds, the US spot Bitcoin ETFs ended the day with roughly $136 million in net capital, extending their winning streak to four consecutive days. Meanwhile, the Ethereum ETF market saw a turnaround after investors withdrew over $79 million from US spot Ethereum funds on Monday. Spot Ethereum ETFs collectively attracted $62.5 million on Tuesday. Flows turned positive as BlackRock’s ETHA reeled in over $59 million. VanEck’s Ethereum ETF logged nearly $2 million and Invesco’s Ethereum fund saw over $1 million yesterday. The crypto ETF’s positive performance came amid Bitcoin’s price surge. Bitcoin hit a high of $64,700 on Tuesday night before settling at around $64,200, per TradingView. The uptick is closely tied to the easing of monetary policies by major global economies. Last week, the US Federal Reserve (Fed) made an aggressive interest rate cut by 50 basis points. Hopeful investors now see a further rate cut by the end of the year, with probabilities rising to 61% for a 50 basis point reduction in November. Apart from the Fed’s adjustments in monetary policy, China’s monetary stimulus package, which came on Tuesday, is also seen as a positive catalyst for the crypto market. China’s recent policy adjustments contributed to a brief surge in Bitcoin’s value, although the impact was modest compared to broader market movements. Bitcoin is now targeting the $65,000 mark, a peak not seen since early August. Analysts suggest that surpassing this threshold is crucial for confirming a bullish trend.

Title: BNY Mellon Moves Forward With Bitcoin Custody Services Following SEC Exemption
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bny-mellon-moves-forward-with-bitcoin-custody-services-following-sec-exemption/
Time Published: 2024-09-25T04:30:29Z
Full Content:
Bank of New York Mellon (BNY Mellon) is making significant strides toward launching custody services for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), following its recent exemption from the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121. As previously reported by Bitcoinist on Friday, BNY Mellon is the first bank to receive this exemption, allowing it to avoid treating the custody of cryptocurrencies as a balance-sheet liability. The announcement came to light during the testimony of Chris Land, general counsel for pro-Bitcoin US Senator Cynthia Lummis, who confirmed that the SEC had granted BNY Mellon this crucial exemption. According to a Bloomberg report, BNY Mellon is now closer to rolling out custody services for Bitcoin and Ether held by clients of exchange-traded products (ETPs). The SEC’s Office of the Chief Accountant conducted a review earlier this year and did not object to BNY Mellon’s determination that safeguarding crypto assets for regulated ETP clients should not be recognized as a liability on its balance sheet. However, BNY Mellon cautioned that this decision does not resolve the broader issues related to SAB 121, which continues to restrict banks’ ability to custody digital assets. The bank indicated its intention to engage further with the SEC’s Office of the Chief Accountant for additional use cases, leveraging a “facts and circumstances” approach. The bank stated that it is actively engaging with its banking regulators to facilitate custody services for crypto ETP clients at scale. Per the report, the crypto custody market is rapidly expanding, with estimates suggesting it could be worth approximately $300 million and growing at around 30% annually. Providers can charge significantly higher fees for safeguarding digital assets compared to traditional securities, with costs potentially reaching up to ten times more. This heightened expense is largely due to the increased security measures needed to protect against cyber threats, which have resulted in substantial financial losses across the digital asset industry. BNY Mellon, which oversees over $50 trillion in assets, has expressed confidence in the strong demand for bank-qualified custodians for digital assets. Currently, the bank supports 80% of SEC-approved Bitcoin and Ether ETPs through its fund services business. By offering crypto custody, BNY Mellon aims to provide clients with a comprehensive end-to-end solution. The recent launch of US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds has highlighted the growing opportunities within the crypto custody sector. Major firms like BlackRock and Fidelity Investments have already accumulated significant assets in these products, further underscoring the market’s potential. At the time of writing, the largest cryptocurrency on the market has risen to $64,380, up nearly 2% in the last 24 hours.

Title: Ethereum ETFs See Largest Outflows Since July: Is Waning Institutional Demand Hurting ETH?
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/ethereum-news/ethereum-etfs-see-largest-outflows-since-july-is-waning-institutional-demand-hurting-eth/
Time Published: 2024-09-25T03:30:35Z
Full Content:
Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) posted the largest outflows since July 2024, with $79.2 million leaving the market on Monday, according to data from SoSoValue. Despite the highly-anticipated and strong start for Ethereum ETFs in July 2024, the latest crypto-based ETFs have, thus far, failed to sustain institutional interest. The latest data from crypto ETF tracker SoSoValue shows that ETH ETFs witnessed a daily total net outflow of $79.2 million on September 23. Upon closer inspection, it appears that the bulk of the outflows originated from Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE), which saw $80.6 million exiting the fund, bringing its cumulative net total outflow to $2.85 billion. In contrast, Bitwise’s ETHW posted net inflows of $1.3 million, propelling its cumulative net total inflows to $320.3 million. It’s worth noting that the latest exodus of funds from Ethereum ETFs is the fourth-largest in terms of value since their inception on July 23, 2024. The total net assets (TNA) of Ethereum ETFs stand at $7.2 billion, compared to $57.9 billion for Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs. The continued underperformance of Ethereum ETFs relative to Bitcoin ETFs does not inspire much confidence in ETH’s future price potential. The ETH/BTC trading pair provides clarity, as the ratio is currently trading at levels it last witnessed way back in April 2021. ETH has erased all the gains against BTC it recorded over the past three years. The recent subpar performance of ETH against BTC isn’t surprising since the latter recorded a new all-time-high (ATH) value of $73,737 in March 2024, while the former has yet to breach its ATH of $4,878 recorded in November 2021. Challenges may lie ahead for ETH ETFs as speculation grows about the potential launch of ETFs for competing cryptocurrencies, such as Ripple’s XRP. Grayscale recently unveiled the first XRP trust in the U.S., paving the way for a future potential XRP ETF. Ethereum’s challenges have not dampened the optimism several digital assets analysts shared toward the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Near the launch of Ethereum ETFs, research firm ASXN predicted that the funds could attract monthly inflows ranging from $800 million to $1.2 billion. Similarly, cryptocurrency exchange Bitwise’s Matt Hougan recently dubbed Ethereum the “Microsoft of blockchains,” indicating confidence in the leading smart contract blockchain protocol. Hougan added that ETH could see a trend reversal to the upside in Q4 2024. ETH trades at $2,610 at press time, down 1.7% in the last 24 hours.

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. Rhiannon McKinnon says three strategies can help good leaders not only weather the current downturn, but emerge with more powerful companies than before. Photo / NZME KEY FACTS Rhiannon McKinnon is the CEO of Cassiobury, a consulting business advising CEOs on strategy, growth and leadership and was CEO of Kiwi Wealth. OPINION Collapsed companies have been in the news over recent months and the latest GDP data shows the economy is weighed down. While data points earlier this year shone light into New Zealand’s dark economic tunnel, the way out remains uncertain, the timing is guesswork, and geopolitical clouds could well darken. It’s a testing time for all CEOs, from the newly minted and mid-career leaders I advise through to battle-scarred titans who weathered the 2007-2008 Global Financial Crisis. Recessionary environments favour the brave. It’s well chronicled that downturns have led to extraordinary success stories. There is a laundry list of companies born or built in recession – from Microsoft, Fedex, Disney, Target and Costco to (closer to home) the likes of Mainfreight, Xero and Icebreaker. A great CEO not only survives a recession but brings their company out on top. Climbing out of economic adversity is really about the leader’s mindset and how it is applied to the current context. Here are some helpful ways to think about it. The short term might look dicey but keep your eyes on the long-term prize. According to the McKinsey Corporate Horizon Index, “from 2001 to 2014, the revenue of long-term [thinking] firms cumulatively grew on average 47% more than the revenue of other firms, and with less volatility.” The CEO’s job is to leave the organisation stronger than when they arrived. The best way is to think what that future state should be in advance. Here are some ways to engage in long-term thinking. First, try your hand at strategic foresight. Imagine long-term future scenarios then model them out, attribute probabilities and prepare. This helps to bring the theoretical future back into the present day and identify one or two short-term metrics that can steer your organisation in the right direction. Second, leverage your organisation’s purpose. In the short term, trade-offs are inevitable but using purpose as your compass will set you up for long-term sustainability. In the words of Blackrock CEO Larry Fink: putting your company’s purpose at the foundation of your relationships with stakeholders is critical to long-term success. Downturns are Darwinian, so factors like controlling costs, customer and talent retention, prioritising liquidity, lean staffing and communication frequency are vital – but that’s a given. As well as a holding pattern, you need a growth pattern driving through the downward cycle. The CEO must back themself and make some bold calls. The CEO is there to decide, not to prevaricate. Make some brave but measured, well-timed, appropriately scaled bets on the future. Without some outsized bets you are unlikely to get some outsized returns.

Title: SEC pushes back decision to open up options trading on spot Ethereum ETFs

Share this article The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has postponed its decision on whether it will approve a rule change allowing options trading on spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The agency said in a filing Tuesday that it was extending the deadline for its decision on a proposed rule change by Nasdaq ISE to list and trade options on the BlackRock iShares Ethereum Trust, also known as ETHA. In a separate filing issued today, the SEC also decided to delay its ruling on a proposed rule change by NYSE American LLC to list and trade options on the Bitwise Ethereum ETF, the Grayscale Ethereum Trust, and the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust. “The Commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action on the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change,” the SEC wrote. The new deadlines are now set for November 10 for Nasdaq ISE and November 11 for NYSE American LLC. BlackRock and Nasdaq submitted a filing proposing a rule change to list and trade options for ETHA on August 6. The proposal aims to broaden investor access and provide them with a low-cost investment instrument for gaining exposure to Ethereum. Shortly after Nasdaq’s filing, NYSE American submitted a proposal to list and trade options for Ethereum ETFs managed by Grayscale and Bitwise. Options trading for BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) was approved by the SEC on September 20, marking an important development for spot Bitcoin ETFs. According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, the nod is a “huge win” for Bitcoin ETFs as it is expected to bring in more liquidity and attract larger investors. Following the SEC’s approval of US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs, there is growing demand for crypto investment products. The trend reflects increasing interest among retail and institutional investors in diversifying their portfolios with digital assets. Morgan Stanley, holding $187 million worth of IBIT shares as of June 30, now lets its financial advisors promote Bitcoin ETFs to a select group of clients. ETF experts believe this move marks the start of widespread adoption of digital assets among Wall Street giants. There is also an increase in the number of investment vehicles that provide direct and indirect exposure to crypto assets. Grayscale has recently expanded its crypto trust products to include ones for Sui, Bittensor, Avalanche, and Ripple, to name a few. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Despite approving options trading for IBIT on Sept. 20, the regulator claimed it needs more time to consider the decision on Ethereum ETFs. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has delayed its decision to allow options trading for BlackRock and Bitwise’s spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) until mid-November, according to Sept. 24 filings. The new deadlines for BlackRock and Bitwise are Nov. 10 and Nov. 11, respectively. The SEC stated it needed more time to consider the proposal and extended the initial 45-day review period that would have ended on Sept. 26 for BlackRock since Nasdaq filed for the rule change for the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF on July 22. The same reasoning was applied to Bitwise’s ETHW, which had its decision date delayed to Nov. 11 since the proposed rule change was filed one day after BlackRock’s. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) received clearance for options trading from the SEC on Sept. 20. Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said this was a “huge win” for Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs, as it will attract more liquidity and, consequently, more “big fish.” Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at VanEck, also shared a report by K33 Research on Sept. 24, which highlighted that Bitcoin’s derivatives market is 279x smaller than its equity and commodity counterparts. Notably, the Bitcoin options volume traded on the top five centralized crypto exchanges was equivalent to roughly $33.3 billion between Sept. 1 and Sept. 22. Meanwhile, Ethereum options’ volume in the same period amounted to just $9.2 billion, over three times smaller than Bitcoin’s. Thus, Ethereum ETFs have even more room for growth with the addition of options trading by the SEC.

Title: TradFi giant BNY Mellon secures regulatory exemption for crypto ETF custody services

The development positions BNY Mellon to challenge Coinbase's current dominance in crypto asset management. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BNY Mellon is taking significant steps toward entering the crypto custody market, particularly for Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), after securing an exemption from the SEC, Bloomberg News reported on Sept. 24. According to the report, BNY Mellon received an exemption from the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121) during a review by the Office of the Chief Accountant. This exemption allows the bank to classify customer crypto holdings differently, meaning they do not need to treat these assets as corporate liabilities. This operational shift could empower more traditional banks to offer crypto custody services, a practice that has largely remained inaccessible to them until now. The development also positions BNY Mellon to challenge Coinbase’s current dominance in crypto asset management and builds on the firm’s crypto custody ambitions. The move to provide custodial services for spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs could significantly disrupt the current market landscape, where Coinbase oversees most of Wall Street’s crypto ETFs, including those for major asset managers like BlackRock, which manages around $10 trillion in assets. Currently, Coinbase’s role has positioned it as a leader in the custody of digital assets for these funds, but BNY Mellon’s entry could increase competition and provide clients with more options. BNY Mellon has expressed a strong interest in the crypto custody sector since early 2023. In January of that year, CEO Robin Vince highlighted digital assets as part of the firm’s long-term strategic vision during an earnings call, noting the growing demand for digital asset services among institutional clients. Analysts estimate the crypto custody market is expanding at approximately 30% annually and is currently valued at $300 million. If this growth trajectory continues, the market could surpass $1 billion by 2032, with an annual increase of around $90 million. Despite the promising outlook, regulatory challenges remain a significant concern for BNY Mellon as it seeks to establish itself in the crypto custody space. Lawmakers, including Congressman Patrick McHenry and Senator Cynthia Lummis, have expressed concerns about the transparency of interactions between SEC staff and private companies. In a bicameral letter addressed to the SEC and other regulators, they cited private meetings that allegedly discussed SAB 121 exemptions. It is unclear whether BNY Mellon’s exemption was part of these discussions, raising questions about the regulatory landscape that will govern the bank’s activities in the crypto market. BNY Mellon’s success will largely depend on its ability to navigate the complex regulatory environment while capitalizing on the growing demand for digital asset services among institutional investors.

Title: Orta the Broken Mountain is the Azj-Kahet World Boss in The War Within

NEXT | Race to World First Day 7: On to Queen Ansurek! The War Within Season 1 begins the week of September 10, and with the opening of Nerub-ar Palace also arrives the opportunity to kill a World Boss. As in Dragonflight and Shadowlands the first tier of TWW has four World Bosses on rotation, one in each of the leveling zones, and for Azj-Kahet it will be Orta the Broken Mountain — up this week. Fortunately there remain no mechanic drops similar to the older expansion’s Legendary Memories so players won’t have to worry about missing out on something important (besides the chance of loot) if they skip a week. As usual the World Bosses drop items that are ilevel-equivalent to the Normal difficulty of the concurrent raid, although with the more staggered ilevels in Palace it should be noted that World Boss drops are i603, or equivalent to the middle bosses of the raid. They can also be upgraded, starting at Champion 3/8. Orta the Broken Mountain resembles previous fights we’ve had such as Kormrok in Hellfire Citadel or Kromog in Blackrock Foundry, with runes and plenty of slamming action. One thing that is important to be aware of is the fact that Orta’s location in the Old Sacrificial Pit of the City of Threads is above an insta-death area, so falling or being thrown into the gaps surrounding the platform will kill you. Runes should be avoided as they will stun when triggered — if this wasn’t a world boss I’d suggest controlled detonation like in similar encounters, but it’s likely best just to avoid them entirely. Tectonic Roars is a raidwide AOE that will knock you back so positioning while it’s being cast is likely important. Finally Orta will grasp and squeeze nearby players at interval and then throw them away once they’re considered a “weakling”; it’s not known whether this means at below a specific health percentage or after a certain amount of time.The Old Sacrificial Pit is well-namedOrta the Broken Mountain is located in the western end of the City of Threads in the Old Sacrificial Pit, and is an easy flight over from the Weaver’s Lair. Because where he’s located is absent of other NPCs you don’t need to worry about your current progress in the zone or whether you are buffed with pheromones. As already mentioned the area beneath the combat zone is instantly fatal, so don’t fall off the platform waiting for the fight to begin.The gear that Orta drops matches the normal Palace appearance, so those looking to farm transmog as well as gear upgrades will want to take the time to down the boss. In addition to unlocking the normal look, upgrading from Champion 3/8 to 5/8 will unlock the heroic appearance as well. Unlike the Dragonflight first tier bosses, Orta drops two possible armor pieces for every class in addition to a ring that can drop for all characters:Ring is Critical Strike/Haste, with Critical Strike providing most of the secondary statsCloth classes can get a Chest that matches the Priest appearance or a Belt that matches the Warlock setLeather classes have a chance at Legs that match the Demon Hunter set or Boots that match the Monk appearanceMail classes can receive a Chest that matches the Hunter appearance or Boots that match the Shaman setPlate classes have a chance at Legs that match the Death Knight set or a Belt that matches the Paladin appearanceAs always defeating Orta the Broken Mountain counts as a World Quest with possible rewards of gold, Coffer Key shards (used for Delves), and Resonance Crystals.Blizzard Watch is made possible by people like you.Please consider supporting our Patreon!Filed Under: Azj-Kahet, World Boss, World QuestAdvertisement Orta the Broken Mountain is located in the western end of the City of Threads in the Old Sacrificial Pit, and is an easy flight over from the Weaver’s Lair.

Saba Capital Management, L.P. has made a notable purchase of shares in BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Health Sciences Term Trust (NYSE:BMEZ), signaling confidence in the investment firm's future prospects. The transaction, which occurred on September 23, involved the acquisition of 2,006 shares at a price of $15.98 each, totaling over $32,055. This transaction adds to Saba Capital's already substantial holding in BlackRock Health Sciences Term Trust, bringing its total ownership to 20,603,574 shares. The investment reflects Saba Capital's ongoing commitment to the trust, which focuses on health sciences-related investments. The purchase was made public through a recent SEC filing, which disclosed the details of the transaction. The filing did not indicate any sales of shares by Saba Capital, suggesting a bullish stance on BMEZ by the investment firm. Investors often monitor such transactions closely as they may provide insights into an insider's view of the company's value and future performance. The actions of Saba Capital, a significant shareholder, could be seen as a vote of confidence in the trust's management and investment strategy. BlackRock Health Sciences Term Trust is known for its focus on equity securities of health sciences and related companies, which are expected to benefit from advances in technology, research, and development in the sector. The disclosed transaction was signed by both Saba Capital Management, represented by Zachary Gindes, and Boaz Weinstein, indicating the involvement of high-level executives in the decision-making process. Investors and market analysts will continue to watch the movements of Saba Capital and other major shareholders in BlackRock Health Sciences Term Trust for further indications of market sentiment and strategic positioning within the health sciences investment space. As Saba Capital Management increases its stake in BlackRock Health Sciences Term Trust (NYSE:BMEZ), investors are keen to understand the financial metrics that may influence this decision. With a market capitalization of $1.69 billion, BMEZ stands as a significant player in the health sciences investment space. One of the notable InvestingPro Tips for BMEZ is its substantial dividend yield, which currently stands at 13.18%. This high yield could be a factor in Saba Capital's strategy, providing a steady income stream from their investment. While the dividend is attractive, another InvestingPro Tip highlights that BMEZ suffers from weak gross profit margins, which could be a concern for investors looking for long-term growth in addition to income. Moreover, the valuation of BMEZ implies a poor free cash flow yield, suggesting that the company's current price may not be supported by the cash it generates. These factors combined could indicate that the investment firm sees the high dividend yield as a sufficient counterbalance to these potential weaknesses. In terms of performance, BMEZ's price is close to its 52-week high, at 95.66% of the peak, and the previous close was at $16.02. The trust has also shown positive short-term returns, with a 1-week price total return of 0.95% and a 1-month price total return of 1.81%. Over the longer term, the 1-year price total return of 24.48% reflects a strong performance in the market. For readers interested in a deeper dive into BMEZ's financials and further InvestingPro Tips, additional insights are available at InvestingPro, which currently lists more tips that could help investors make informed decisions.

Title: Destruction of Agriculture, Rights of Indian Farmers: “Waltzing with Bayer” Makes The Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) Blind: India Ditches Mandate to Farmers and Uses Mutagenesis (Genetic Mutations) to Drive Toxic Herbicide HT Crops Into India
URL: https://www.globalresearch.ca/bayer-icar-ditches-mandate-farmers-uses-mutagenesis-ht-crops/5868482
Time Published: 2024-09-24T19:30:06Z
Full Content:
A GMO PIL was filed in early 2005 (ArunaRodrigues & Ors. vs. Union of India, Writ Petition (Civil) No. 260 of 2005) in the Supreme Court (SC) to protect our natural environment, farmlands and foods from being made toxic via agrichemicals and irreversible GMO contamination. Contamination is the outstanding concern with GMOs because these self-replicating organisms, insect/wind mediated, cannot be recalled. India is a treasure trove, a listed ‘hot spot’ of 17 worldwide centres of genetic diversity and/or centres of origin. In India, this includes mustard, rice and brinjal. India’s foundational seed stock will be contaminated and would, as a scientific certainty, change the structure of our food at the molecular level, irremediably and irreversibly. “Any toxicity that there is will remain without remedy”, said the late Prof Schubert of the Salk Institute. With a commercialised GM crop, contamination is certain. GMO and non-GMO agriculture cannot co-exist. This is the hard evidence. The application of the precautionary principle (PP) to this technology is therefore a sine qua non. In 2007, we secured an order in this PIL from the SC that there should be “no contamination”, (even) during field trials. However, given the nature of GMO genetic contamination, the only way this order can be implemented is to bar all field trials. And this is precisely the action that the GEAC took at its 75th meeting of March 2007. Keeping in mind that India is THE centre of origin of rice, the GEAC, at the insistence of basmati rice exporters and the Ministry of Commerce, employing the PP, decided not to allow field trials of GM rice in the basmati growing areas of the country, recognising the potential threat of contamination. The APEDA (Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority) required a certificate stating that no GM rice, groundnut and sesame seeds have been permitted in India due to a ban imposed by Russia on these crops because of a fear of GMO contamination. In the 20 years since the PIL was filed, it is by now pretty well conclusive that the evidence from GMO-producing countries (which are just a handful), demonstrates that GMOs are not safe for the environment and for human and animal health. In the US, for example, the impact of toxic food on children’s health has been devastating. During a 40-year timeframe, childhood disease has risen from 6% to 60 %, with a commensurate rise in national health expenditure from zero, 40 years ago, to trillions of dollars today. It is essential that our regulators take on board the evidence and institute a biosafety regimen that is strictly independent, up-to-date and rigorous, which currently does not exist. So, two questions come to mind: Why has the ICAR developed and released mutagenic HT rice varieties? Why did the apex regulator with India’s regulatory regime take no notice of this and stop it? The ICAR (Indian Council of Agricultural Research) has developed and released two HT (herbicide-tolerant) basmati rice varieties (Pusa Basmati Rice 1979 and Pusa Basmati Rice 1985) and two HT non-basmati varieties tolerant to the herbicide IMAZETHAPYR. HT Wheat is also in the wings. We are informed that these HT crops have been produced through induced chemical mutagenesis. Therefore, these HT crops represent genetic modification of organisms/micro-organisms by induced chemical mutagenesis and are, in fact, GMOs because they create changes in the genome of plants. But and however, these mutagenic HT crops are not synonymous with modern biotechnology or genetically engineered GMOs (recombinant). This is EU law. The development of these HT crops has taken several years in planning, development and production. It goes without saying that the GEAC and our collective regulatory bodies have clearly been aware of this. And it is pertinent to add that the ICAR is nominated to the GEAC Committee as an Expert Member with others, including the DG Health Services. HT crops have very serious deleterious effects, based on empirical evidence. It is a failed farm technology and causes harm to animals and humans. So, it is curious and indeed unconscionable that these mutagenic HT rice varieties were not stopped at the first instance. The GEAC (apex regulator), should absolutely have done so. An HT crop is an HT crop whether produced by GE techniques or GMOs using chemical mutagenesis techniques. The Supreme Court-appointed TEC (Technical Expert Committee), in 2012-13, recommended a double bar on HT crops: (a) for being an HT crop per se because of their empirically proven, serious egregious impacts, (evidence after more than 40 years of growing these crops in the US/Argentina/Brazil) and (b) if in a centre of diversity or origin. This double bar applies straightforwardly to rice as a priority, as recognised by the GEAC itself, and also to mustard. Beyond this, the Indian ‘Rules of 1989’ are outdated and quite inadequate, as has become clear over the years, and suffer from the malaise that there is “NO statutory regulatory framework in place in the form of a Parliamentary law and is in fact subordinate legislation” (Justice Nagarathna in July 2024 in the recent judgement in this PIL, WP (Civil) No. 260 of 2005). The ‘Rules of 1989’, nevertheless, do pertain to genetic modification of an organism. A conscionable regulator would have and should have viewed this with new vision in 2024 and applied it to GMOs created through mutagenesis, and if necessary, through a timely notification on their applicability to these GMOs arising from induced chemical mutagenesis. The hard reason behind such complete blindness is undoubtedly the long-standing and unlawful conflict of interest that exists in the entire regulatory framework — our regulatory bodies have been captured by the biotech and agrichemical Industries. Usually, every effort is employed by regulators, through subterranean regulation and secrecy, to obfuscate a conflict of interest because it, ethically and legally, invalidates their position as regulators. Not this time though. Moreover, the brazenness and caution-thrown-to-the-wind action by the ICAR in inking in an MOU with Bayer (Sept 2023), which also owns Monsanto (2018), defies belief. It is breathtaking; all pretence is gone. We have a cancer that is metastasising vertically and horizontally throughout the entire regulatory body. (This is clear from the appointment of the ICAR to the GEAC Committee as Expert Member.) It is symptomatic of a cancer of corruption that plagues the entire global food system. Dr Casey Means says: “The largest merger ever done in Germany was Bayer Monsanto, where Bayer, which is a pharmaceutical company merged with Monsanto, which is an agrochemical company in the United States. If you look at what Bayer makes, they make cancer drugs for things like non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. If you look at what Monsanto makes, which is Roundup, which is the most widely used pesticide in America, the cancer that it causes is non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. (There are over 100,000 court cases winding their way through US courts — added by A R). They paid out USD 11 billion in the past couple years for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma cases. So, the companies are merging that are directly known to cause the disease, with a medical company that has a treatment for the disease. This is very dark.” (Source/Tweet has been removed) It should be noted that the Bayer-Monsanto Roundup herbicide is also an endocrine disruptor and is linked to birth defects. Monsanto and the US Environmental Protection Agency have both known for over 40 years that glyphosate and its formulations cause cancer. However, penetrating the huge Indian market represents a massive cash cow for foreign corporations, especially if their HT crops (by either technology of genetic engineering or chemical mutagenesis) get market approval. This would certainly make up for declining demand elsewhere. For instance, in July 2023, it was reported by the BBC that German-based Bayer expects to take a USD 2.5bn (USD 2.8bn) hit due to slower demand for its glyphosate-based products. The ICAR has recently also concluded MoUs with Amazon and Syngenta. Researcher and writer Colin Todhunter says: “We are currently seeing an acceleration of the corporate consolidation of the entire global agri-food chain. The big data conglomerates, including Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook and Google, have joined traditional agribusiness giants, such as Corteva, Bayer, Cargill and Syngenta, in a quest to impose their model of food and agriculture on the world. “The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and big financial institutions, like BlackRock and Vanguard, are also involved, whether through buying up huge tracts of farmland, pushing biosynthetic (fake) food and genetic engineering technologies or more generally facilitating and financing the aims of the mega agri-food corporations”. From Agrarianism to Transhumanism: The Long March to Dystopia The ICAR is certainly facilitating this process in India. It is important to understand that the regulatory agencies of both the US and India are run by the big food processing companies, big agribusiness concerns, the chemicals/pesticide conglomerates and the Gates Foundation. India’s food is becoming increasingly toxic and unsafe. This will lead to chronic disease in India just as it has in the US, children in particular. The genesis of the dominance of private interests in our food and agriculture lies in an MOU signed over 20 years ago (see below). That poison has spread and is rapidly being cemented now, through the MOUs with Bayer, Syngenta and Amazon. The Knowledge Initiative in Agricultural Research and Education (KIA) was signed in 2006 and, astonishingly, the Indian Government assigned Monsanto to the closest scrutiny of India’s genetic resources as a result of its position on the Board of the Indo-US KIA. Monsanto effectively represented the US government in order to facilitate GM food crops into Indian agriculture. The ICAR was inducted as the signing institution for the Union of India for an alliance with the US for GM crops. The ICAR was required to provide “free access” to its entire network of 47 agricultural laboratories and universities so that US companies and research institutes could carry out joint research with ICAR in biotech areas “that have the potential for rapid commercialisation.” This ‘agreement’ is no longer ‘active’. But its spores and workings continue to influence public institutions of agriculture, including public-private-partnerships with the industry that the Department of Biotechnology partners in GM crop development or the SAUs (State Agricultural Universities) to ensure that ‘policy and regulation’ is speedily tailored to facilitate the introduction of a full range of GM food crops. The State Agricultural Universities of TAU (Tamilnadu Agriculture University) and Dharwad, for example, were involved in the development of Bt brinjal, funded by US AID, Monsanto and Cornell University. The ongoing capture of public policy space by foreign interests is not lost on the Peoples’ Commission on Public Sector and Services (PCPSS), which includes eminent academics, jurists, erstwhile administrators, trade unionists and social activists. In a recently released statement, it expressed concern that Bayer will exploit the ICAR’s vast infrastructure to pursue its own commercial plans within India to boost sales of toxic proprietary products. The PCPSS notes that there are several ICAR-sponsored research institutions and state-level agricultural universities, which are engaged in outstanding research relevant to Indian agriculture. A number of states have launched their own natural farming missions to free debt trapped farmers from the use of costly chemicals and other unsustainable practices. The PCPSS says it is therefore not clear as to why the ICAR should choose to promote Bayer in multiple areas of agricultural research. Mutagenic HT crops have somehow, willy-nilly been introduced into India and in basmati varieties, by-passing the Apex Regulator the GEAC. The ICAR and India’s collective regulatory agencies have aimed for India’s jugular for maximum harm to her agriculture and food. It is difficult to quite comprehend just how wrong policies that promote HT crops are. A wholesale sell-out of India’s agriculture and her food is being relentlessly pursued. Evidence of the utter disaster that HT crops are, is clear and is based on empirical research findings of 35+ years of growing these crops in the US, Argentina and Brazil. These findings provide insight into the harm that all HT crops, in this specific case by mutagenesis, will have on our farming. This seriously egregious policy decision must therefore be urgently reversed and stopped. In July 2024, I wrote to the ICAR highlighting what is set out below. The ICAR’s introduction of HT crops highlights the consequences for India: the ICAR (India’s regulatory body for farming) has effectively ditched its mandate to Indian farmers and farming, whose competitive advantage is organic farming based on soil health, sustainability and regenerative agriculture. By avoiding synthetic pesticides and fertilisers, organic farms provide a habitat for a wide range of organisms, from soil microbes and insects to birds and mammals. The biodiversity provided by organic farms is crucial for ecosystem resilience and the provision of ecosystem services such as water purification, pollination and nutrient cycling, which benefit all species. This step is a potential threat to India’s export markets, which are based on organic standards, along with the necessary co-surety that India’s foods and farms are not contaminated by herbicides, a consequence of using HT crops. In the matter of rice, HT crops are of the greatest concern because India is the ‘centre of origin’ of rice, which means that India has an immensely rich diversity in rice. The ICAR has, furthermore, rather perversely selected basmati, historically, the queen of rice varieties, in which to introduce an HT trait. The ICAR’s action directly impacts the vital issue of contaminating our germ plasm in rice and contravenes a Supreme Court Order of “no contamination”. Our export markets for basmati are in excess of USD 5 billion in 2023-24. The ICAR’s action will directly impact India’s exports and, thereby, impact farmer export potential, incomes and income opportunities that premium prices provide. In my letter to the ICAR, I also pointed out that HT crops are pesticidal crops and are not meant for human consumption. Therefore, HT crops must be tested as pesticidal crops but are not. The sprays used include chemicals and surfactants, the latter force both weeds and the HT crop to absorb significant quantities of the herbicide that is sprayed on them. The resistant crop stands. Everything else dies including non-target organisms. The use of these surfactants encourages indiscriminate use. The ICAR was made aware that, based on empirical evidence, HT crops are a failed technology, which spawn super weeds, higher herbicide use and no added performance yield. I provided the ICAR with empirical data to support my claims. Overall herbicide use (US Geological Survey) has increased more than tenfold, from 20 million pounds/year (prior to HT Crops in 1992) to 280 million pounds/year by 2012. In other words, 527million pounds more total herbicide was used in the US during this period (1992-2012) due to commercialised HT crops. As of 2013, HT crops had caused the emergence of some 60 million acres or about 25% of US cropland (ref. TEC report) of ‘super’ weeds resistant to herbicides, doubling since 2010 or about 50% of crop area sown to herbicides. The costs to farmers of weed control have increased by up to 100%, seed prices have increased threefold (from 1996). The combined onslaught is putting US farmers out of business as they struggle with losses on a substantial scale. The ICAR was made aware that for India HT crops are a particularly perverse use of technology, irrespective of whether GE or through mutagenesis. The technology risks small and marginal farmers’ crops and ‘jari-booti’ herbs and plants, used in many Ayurvedic medicines, because of herbicide drift among other things. Moreover, HT crops are designed for monoculture. It bears repeating that HT crops are completely unsuited to Indian smallholder farming. They also uniquely impact the employment of women in weeding (MS Swaminathan Task force 2004). As stated above, HT Crops will deny Indian farmers their niche export markets, which are not contaminated and will be endangered by herbicide. Furthermore, the market for organics is growing by a robust minimum 20% pa. Both requirements attract premium prices. Like Bayer’s other toxic herbicides, glyphosate and glufosinate, imazethapyr is also a systemic broad-spectrum herbicide and is banned in some countries and not approved for use in the EU. This is an additional red flag with regard to the use of this herbicide. Prof. Jack Heinemann notes that antibiotic resistance is also a cause for concern. Herbicides (including imazethapyr) must be tested for their ability to cause bacterial antibiotic resistance. Common adjuvants (e.g. emulsifiers/surfactants) used in association with herbicide active ingredients alter the response of bacteria to antibiotics. Combined with antibiotic use in medicine, veterinary medicine, and crop protection, co-exposures to herbicide (and agrochemicals in general) and antibiotics are common. Co-exposures alter the response of bacteria, notably those that can cause diseases in people, companion animals, or livestock, to antibiotics. In time, the co-exposure increases resistance to antibiotics. Heinemann recommends: “it is necessary to test any herbicide, including of imazethapyr, to be able to exclude the possibility that it can cause antibiotic resistance. We have not identified any chemical or biological similarities between the herbicides that would allow one to predict in advance that a particular chemical or formulation would not have this effect on bacteria” And “that effects on bacteria that can cause disease be considered whenever considering adopting a cropping practice that combines herbicide use and herbicide tolerant crops. The enormous burden of antibiotic resistance should not be unnecessarily exacerbated by use of herbicides”. India’s population has some of the highest levels of antibiotic resistance in the world. Any spread of HT crops would put us at severe risk of resistance and disease. Despite these environmental and health concerns, the herbicide market in India is projected to grow by around 54% in the next five years, from USD 361.85 million in 2024 to USD 558.17 million by 2029. In view of the above evidence of serious irreversible harm to health, food and agriculture across several dimensions, it is a required scientific response for the ICAR and our regulators to immediately withdraw HT crops, including HT rice varieties and desist from introducing any HT crop whether through mutagenesis or genetic engineering. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article to your friends and colleagues.

Title: Is the US Abandoning Europe Because of High Cost and Low Yield? Peter Koenig
URL: https://www.globalresearch.ca/us-abandoning-europe-high-cost-low-yield/5868562
Time Published: 2024-09-24T18:23:28Z
Full Content:
The interview with NTV was based in response to a Bloomberg article of 9 September 2024 where Andreas Kuhn, geopolitical analyst, writes that America will abandon Europe next, and this, regardless of who wins the election. . . . . . . It has ceased to be profitable for the United States to support Europe, and it is much more profitable to focus resources on Southeast Asia. See the full article here. The newscast of NTV. includes only small segments picked out from a long interview with Peter Koenig (which was not featured by the NTV channel), see minutes 26:10 and 28:15. Below, we provide the complete transcript with Peter Koenig which NTV decided not to publish. (censorship?) See video (Russian) below (after transcript) . . NTV: What are your views on this? Peter Koenig (PK): The US abandoning Europe may be a good thing. It would finally bring back autonomy to Europe – a type of sovereignty it has not known since the end of WWII, because Europe – the European Union (EU) has gradually and ever faster become a vassal state, or union of states, of the United States, doing the bidding for Washington, including supporting a US proxy-war on her territory – Ukraine against Russia. It seems regardless who wins the Presidency, Europe has ceased to be of primary interest for the US. It was never profitable in the sense of money. It was a strategic dominance. Controlling Europe is moving closer to Russia, and at the same time moving NATO troops ever closer to the borders of Russia – and this despite the promise by then Secretary of State James Baker, who in 1991 replied to Mr. Gorbachev’s worries about NATO expansion, “not one inch further”. That promise was broken multiple times. With the right EU leaders in place, the unelected EU Commissioner, as well as the heads of Germany, France, Holland and so on; and with the indoctrinated climate hoax, the EU could be manipulated to economically destroy itself, committing economic suicide, so to speak. Germany is a prime example, as the economic leader of Europe. Under no circumstances could Germany prosper, and establishing friendly relations with Russia, something many Germans and German businesses saw as a logical development – was a no-no. To top it off, in September 2022, US-led secret services blew up the Nordstream Pipeline, supplying crucial and inexpensive gas from Russia to mainly Germany but also other European countries. Germany did not protest, instead supported ludicrous claims that it may have been Russia, and lately, it could have been Ukraine. In the meantime, while “sanctioning” anyone not following strict orders from the EC, to not buying petrol or gas from Russia, Europe in 2023 / 2024 has imported more oil and gas from Russia than before February 2014 – the year of US-instigated Maidan Coup. No longer through a direct pipeline but via India, Turkey, and Ukraine – knowing that energy from Russia was a lifeline for the faltering European economy. One could call it hypocrisy – or lie-propaganda. A new alliance between Germany – and by extension Europe – may bring back the Eurasian market; Eurasia being the largest contiguous landmass (36% of the earths total landmass) on earth (55 million sq.km), housing 5 billion people (about 2/3 of the world population) and controlling about half of the world’s GDP. Pulling Europe away from Eurasia was one of the goals of the two hot world wars. Russia, the Soviet Union, was and still is the stumbling block. Thanks God. In brief, Europe must be economically and financially wiped out, so to speak, for the US to remain the world’s hegemon. Now, Europe is so far ahead in her auto-destruction, that the US may, indeed, direct her attention to other parts of the world, like to Asia and the rapidly emerging Global South, with the BRICS at the center. NTV: How will Trump throw Europe if he wins? PK: This is a good question. Trump is like a roller-coaster, difficult to assess. He probably must follow the script imposed from above, leaving Europe to the wolves. However, Europe is still very much bound to the US through NATO. Of the 32 NATO members, 30 are in Europe. Will Trump do away with NATO, as he often hinted at? I doubt it. His action vis-à-vis Europe is difficult to predict. How about his relation with Russia? Sometimes he says he is friends with President Putin, other times he said Mr. Putin disappointed him. He will go after Iran and China – in one way or another, if his talks are to be believed. But even that is not sure. Iran is not the same Iran he knew. Today, Iran is a close ally of China and Russia, and is part of the BRICS, aspiring to become a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). Iran has strong backing. Trump and Europe: wait and see. NTV: How will Kamala Harris do it? Bloomberg writes that it is as hypocritical as possible: talking about the unshakable support of Europe, but at the same time cutting costs for the military presence. What do you think? PK: Kamala is a puppet. Sorry for the term. She has no agenda. All her agenda items are following a script given from “above”, pretty much the same as with President Joe Biden. The recent debate with Trump indicated that very clearly. She talked the line of the common narrative, no mater whether this narrative if full of lies. Plus, as has emerged in the meantime, she was told what to say through special earpieces. And it was clear to a child, the ABC moderators were biased towards her. Trump, instead of taking her up on these untruths matter of factly, his emotions run through with him, making his answers often ridiculous. That is just a sideline. Kamala will follow instructions from the Globalists. NTV: Why has Europe ceased to be a beneficial ally for the United States? PK: Europe has not ceased to be beneficial for the US. As mentioned before, Europe is an important Globalist ally through NATO – with 30 of the 32 member states being European. These 30 members finance a lot if not most of the NATO budget, they bear de facto a heavier burden than the US and Canada, no matter on the monetary budget, despite what former President Trump said. But the hegemon feels that Europe no longer needs its immediate attention because it has been driven so far ahead in its effort of self-destruct, that an alliance with Russia – and with Eurasia – for example through the Chinese Belt and Road is no longer a significant risk. But that is Washington’s assessment. And often their assessments have not much to do with reality. It needs little change in European politics – a sense of returning to sovereignty – to become a game-changer. Many, if not most of Europeans feel that Russia and by extension Eurasia are natural partners of Europe, and that potential – for which Mr. Putin was always open – should be explored. Image: Mario Draghi NTV: What do you think about Mario Draghi’s [former President of the European Central Bank] recent report that the EU is turning into an economic outsider? PK: Mr. Draghi is right. The EU is not only a European outsider, but is an economic disaster – and so is the Euro, the little brother of the fiat dollar. Mr. Draghi is right for precisely the reasons mentioned before. Europe has let itself become a vassal of Washington, following all instructions, orders of “sanctioning” Russia and China, and has totally lost her independence. Is it too late to bring Europe back as an economic power? It is never too late. European leaders must take back their countries – and even at the detriment of the EU, become sovereign nations again with their own sovereign currencies – and being able to deal with whomever they want, east and west – not being captive to Washington’s wishes and whims. The US’s hegemony is gone so or so. It’s just a matter of time for the final straw to break. So, the sooner Europe realizes that their survival, economically and socially, is autonomy and sovereignty, plus cooperation with Russia and the East, the better. NTV: AN IMPORTANT QUESTION: How much does the United States spend annually to protect Europe? A) Considering Ukraine? B) Excluding Ukraine? PK: Who really knows. On Europe per se – the US spends nothing in my opinion. There are no American subsidies to the EU or any European country. It’s rather the other way around, Europe largely helps fund NATO – and, as we all know, NATO has long become obsolete, and become an aggressive war machine of the US. So, whatever Europe funds for NATO, is a direct contribution to the wars fought by or on behalf of the US. Those who believe NATO exists to defend Europe should start thinking again. As to the funding of Ukraine – it is also not well-known. Recent figures that were advanced by the US State Department were about 200 billion dollars. Is this really all? Does that include weaponry? Or does it include reimbursable loans? All that is kept on purpose pretty wishy-washy. In any case, the US is not planning to lose any money on Ukraine, as Ukraine is rapidly being privatized by BlackRock and Co. That means, sizeable returns from investments in agriculture (one of the most fertile soils in the world – Ukraine was formerly called Europe’s breadbasket) – and huge reserves in natural resources, rare earths, gold, silver — other minerals. NTV: And why did Europe suddenly decide at one time to shift the care of ensuring its security onto the shoulder of the United States? PK: Is this statement correct? It is rather the US telling Europe you do not need your own defense, because we – you and the US – have NATO, a common defense force. Europe, or most of Europe fell for it. Except French President De Gaulle, who exited NATO in 1966. He was a visionary, against NATO from the bottom of his heart, saying France and by extension Europe MUST be able to defend herself. President Sarkozy, a WEF implant, rejoined NATO in 2009. General Charles de Gaulle on the Chemin du Roy, Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pérade, 1967 (Licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0) Europe would be and is totally capable of building up her own defense forces, and I mean DEFENSE – not offense. And this outside of NATO. Europe has no natural enemies. Europe’s “enemies”, like Russia and the East, China and so on, have been invented by the US. There is hope for Europe to become independent again – and to link up with her natural neighbors, and partners, like Russia and the rest of Eurasia. But it needs perhaps a shock to bring western leaders out of their vassalic slumber. Video in Russian * * Click the share button below to email/forward this article to your friends and colleagues.

Title: Toyota Ventures’s Jim Adler says climate tech startups need to secure future buyers | TechCrunch
URL: https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/24/toyota-venturess-jim-adler-says-climate-tech-startups-need-to-secure-future-buyers/
Time Published: 2024-09-24T17:21:34Z
Full Content:
Comment Jim Adler, founder and general partner at Toyota Ventures, is concerned that climate technology gains could fall into the “valley of death” if companies fail to drum up enough demand to survive. And he’s not wrong to be worried. Climate tech investments in the first half of 2024 dipped for the second consecutive year, both in terms of overall funds invested and deal count as investors shy away from funding what can be capital-intensive, high-risk businesses without a clear path to market. Speaking at a Climate Week NYC event Tuesday, Adler said one way for climate tech to secure that demand is through forward offtake agreements. This is when a customer promises to buy an agreed-upon amount of a product at a specified price by a specified date. “I like that a lot because that encourages investors to invest to hit that date,” Adler told TechCrunch. “We do early-stage investment, which is a telescope into the future … If we know there’s a customer then we and other investors will invest at the early stage because we know we’re investing for something.” During a presentation to a room of about 75 people in midtown Manhattan, Adler laid out how historically, disruptive technologies — from railways to oil pipelines to electric power — have only been able to scale once they hit the tipping point of 10% to 20% adoption rates. Even if sectors have enough supply and innovation, if they don’t hit those rates, “the dynamics of capitalism don’t kick in,” Adler said. “If the demand doesn’t show up, the tech dies,” he continued. “Capitalism is a way to scale these technologies, but not if the customers don’t show up. So how do we help customers show up?” This is an especially prescient question when we consider that growth-stage deals in climate tech declined 33% in the first half of the year compared to the same period last year, per a CTVC report. That hinders the growth of companies that have proven their tech on a smaller scale and need additional funds to expand. Adler says growth-stage investors won’t invest without clear demand signals from customers, like forward offtake agreements. So how do startups get customers to make such agreements? Pushing the levers of government mandates is one way. Take Revel, for example, the startup that started as an e-moped sharing company and now is pursuing EV charging infrastructure. While organic demand for Revel’s charging services today is likely low — it’s mainly buffeted by ride-hail and taxi drivers, both from Revel’s own small service and Uber, Lyft, yellow cab and livery drivers — mandates from states like California and New York that require all new car sales to be electric by 2035 provide investors with a much-needed demand signal. Revel has raised around $270 million, per PitchBook data, with heavy hitters like BlackRock leading the startup’s rounds. Adler said he’s hoping low-carbon fuels, like hydrogen, will have their own moment in securing future demand. “If hydrogen shows up at $2 per kilogram in bulk, that could really push adoption to the right and up the curve,” he said. “Investors can then invest knowing that there’s a customer at the end of this in some volume,” Adler said. “It’s super important. If this doesn’t happen, I think we all need to be a little worried.” Correction: A previous version of this article neglected to include that Revel’s EV charging customer base today includes ride-hail and taxi drivers from other apps and services.

BlackRock has announced that the $10 trillion asset manager was selected as the outsourced fiduciary manager of Stichting Shell Pensioenfonds, the defined benefit pension fund of Shell plc. Shell will outsource asset management of its 27-billion-euro ($30 billion) fund entirely to BlackRock. As of August 31, SSPF had a funded status of 134.5%, well above the fund’s minimum required funding ratio of 105%. As of December 31, 2023, the fund had 5,206 participants, 6,468 former participants and 18,160 beneficiaries who joined the company before July 1, 2013, and are based in the Netherlands. The transfer of Shell’s pension assets to BlackRock is expected to be completed by mid-2025. Asset management for Shell’s Shell Nederland Pensioenfonds Stichting pension fund in the Netherlands, for employees who joined the company on or after July 1, 2013, will remain unchanged under Achmea Investment Management, according to Shell. Never miss a story — sign up for CIO newsletters to stay up-to-date on the latest institutional investment industry news.  Globally, more than $300 billion of assets have been transferred to BlackRock’s OCIO business to date. BlackRock was named a winner in the asset management and servicing OCIO category at the 2023 CIO Industry Innovation Awards. As a part of the outsourcing, Shell’s pension will move to a defined contribution model, as required by the Netherlands Future Pensions Act. BlackRock will assist in the transition to the new pension system. A spokesperson for Shell could not be immediately reached for comment. Future Pensions Act Shell’s appointment of BlackRock as its fiduciary manager comes as the Netherlands plans a complete overhaul of the country’s pension system by the end of the decade. As part of the Dutch Future Pensions Act, which came into effect in July 2023, all defined benefit plans are required to switch to a defined contribution system. Pension funds based in the country have until January 1, 2028, to make the switch. “In light of the developments regarding the Future Pensions Act and the request from our social partners to transition, the Board has decided, after a careful selection process, to appoint BlackRock as fiduciary manager for SSPF,” said Kenan Yildirim, director of Stichting Shell Pensioenfonds, in a statement. The law requires defined benefit plan sponsors to submit a transition plan by January 1, 2025. “In anticipation of the upcoming changes, the appointment of BlackRock will safeguard the execution of the investment process and ensure that the costs and risks of the transition are carefully managed,” Yildirim continued in the statement. “In addition, our participants will benefit from BlackRock’s expertise, global scale and experience in risk management and sustainability.” Related Stories: UPS Hires Goldman Sachs Asset Management as OCIO for $43.4 Billion Pension Plans Cerity Partners Merges with Agility in OCIO Push BlackRock to Acquire Alternatives Data Provider Preqin Tags: BlackRock, Defined Benefit, Defined Contribution, OCIO, outsourced CIO, Shell, Stichting Shell Pensioenfonds « CalSTRS Promotes 2 to Investment Director

In a challenging market environment, TCP Capital Corp (TCPC) stock has reached a 52-week low, trading at $8.25. This price level reflects a significant downturn for the investment firm, which has experienced a -29.11% change over the past year. Investors are closely monitoring the company's performance as it navigates through the prevailing economic headwinds that have impacted its valuation. The 52-week low serves as a critical indicator for the market participants who track the stock's resilience and potential for recovery in the coming months. In other recent news, BlackRock TCP Capital (NASDAQ:TCPC) Corp has undergone a significant leadership reshuffle, with Rajneesh Vig stepping down as Chairman and CEO. Philip Tseng has been appointed to fill these roles, while Jason Mehring will assume the position of President. Other key appointments include Patrick Wolfe as COO and Dan Worrell joining Tseng as Co-Chief Investment Officer. These changes come alongside the company's strong financial performance, with Q2 2024 earnings reporting an adjusted net investment income of $0.38 per share and an annualized return on average equity of approximately 14%. The company also declared a third-quarter dividend of $0.34 per share. In a major financial move, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) TCP Capital Corp repaid $250 million of the 2024 Notes, leading to an increase in the company's asset coverage ratio to 180.2%. These recent developments reflect the company's strategic plan for a seamless transition and its commitment to maintaining a diversified investment portfolio. Analysts have noted the firm's disciplined underwriting standards and active restructuring efforts for several companies. The company's financial strategy, executive changes, and performance are based on recent press releases and earnings reports. In light of TCP Capital Corp's (TCPC) recent performance, InvestingPro data provides a comprehensive view of the company's financial health. As of the last twelve months leading up to Q2 2024, TCPC's revenue has grown by 16.64%, indicating a positive trajectory in its earning capacity. Despite the stock trading near its 52-week low, the company has maintained a robust dividend yield of 23.44%, which is a testament to its commitment to returning value to shareholders, as evidenced by 13 consecutive years of dividend payments. InvestingPro Tips suggest caution due to the stock being in oversold territory, which could signal a potential rebound or further declines depending on market conditions. Moreover, the fact that four analysts have revised their earnings downwards for the upcoming period could imply future challenges. However, TCPC's liquid assets surpassing short-term obligations is a reassuring sign of financial stability. For investors seeking a deeper dive into TCP Capital Corp's performance and future outlook, there are additional InvestingPro Tips available, providing a more nuanced understanding of the company's investment profile.

Title: MicroStrategy Outpaces BlackRock's IBIT by Over 3x Year-to-Date
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2024/09/24/microstrategy-outpaces-blackrocks-ibit-by-over-3x-year-to-date/

Full Content:
Election 2024 coverage presented by Note: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates. Disclosure: The writer owns shares in MicroStrategy. The launch of U.S. bitcoin exchange-traded funds on Jan. 11, 2024, has become one of the year's most significant financial events. These ETFs, including the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), have collectively attracted $17.7 billion in net inflows since their debut, according to Farside data. IBIT, to some, has emerged as a competitor to MicroStrategy (MSTR), a company renowned for its substantial bitcoin holdings and dual business model. Led by Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy currently holds 252,220 bitcoins, valued at approximately $16 billion. Year-to-date, MicroStrategy's stock has risen 119% compared to IBIT's 35%, reflecting a more than threefold outperformance. From the opening of the ETFs until around Feb. 23, IBIT outperformed MicroStrategy as investors either shifted capital to the new funds or took profits on what had been a large run higher in MSTR's stock in the weeks prior to Jan. 11. This trend of profit-taking spread to bitcoin as well, as long-term holders (those holding bitcoin for 155 days or more) sold approximately one million bitcoin from December 2023 through the first quarter of 2024, according to Glassnode data. There are several key reasons for MicroStrategy's impressive returns and its ability to outperform IBIT. One of the first factors is fees. ETFs come with an expense ratio—currently 0.25% for IBIT—which acts as a drag on returns. In contrast, MicroStrategy does not charge such a fee to shareholders, making it more attractive over time in terms of cost efficiency. Furthermore, MicroStrategy operates as a business that generates revenue beyond its bitcoin thesis, primarily through its analytics operations. This diversification allows the company to produce free cash flow and could provide some cushioning during bitcoin's drawdowns even as the stock outperforms during the token's rallies. Since bitcoin's all-time high in March, bitcoin has decreased by 13% and IBIT is down 14%, while MicroStrategy has declined by 15%. Additionally, MicroStrategy has the flexibility to increase its bitcoin per share through debt or equity offerings. For example, it recently upsized a convertible note offering from $700 million to $1.01 billion, using the proceeds to acquire more bitcoin—something IBIT cannot do directly, unless it sees more inflows from investors. Mark Palmer, Senior Research Analyst at Benchmark, said MicroStrategy's recent financial strategies, such as issuing convertible bonds and retiring high-interest debt, have improved its financial flexibility and made the stock more efficient access to capital markets compared to other bitcoin-buying stocks. "A strong case could be made that MSTR following the convert issuance and senior notes retirement had more flexibility to access the capital markets than it had prior to it given its lighter interest burden and increased holdings of unencumbered bitcoins," said Palmer, who has a buy rating on the stock and price target of $215. In terms of marketing and visibility, MicroStrategy has also maintained a higher ranking in Google search trend than IBIT, signaling better recognition and interest. This gap has, however narrowed of late, as options trading on IBIT have now been approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC).

Title: Putin’s cursed flagship ‘will never sail again’ as rustbucket Admiral Kuznetsov’s crew sent to Ukraine as cannon fodder

Skip to comments. Posted on 09/24/2024 7:32:06 AM PDT by marcusmaximus VLADIMIR Putin's cursed naval flagship is unlikely to ever sail again after he sent its crew to fight in the war in Ukraine. The Admiral Kuznetsov is the tyrant's only aircraft carrier and has not been in service for eight years. Desperate Vlad has now designated some of the rustbucket's 1,500 crew members as cannon fodder for his brutal invasion. The seamen have formed a land-based "frigate" battalion within Russia's 1st Guards Tank Army, according to OSINT investigator Moklasen. Some of them have already gone missing or died, Forbes reported. Putin had wanted the 305-metre-long Soviet-era warship to play a role in the war but the accident-prone vessel with up to 2,000 crew will sink if it sails again.

Title: Who is Shorting Trump Media & Technology Group Corp
(NASDAQ: DJT) stock

Skip to comments. Posted on 09/24/2024 7:12:39 AM PDT by Eleutheria5 I bought my first ETFs of DJT (the flag ship corporation of Truth Social) months ago at over $30.00. Despite Trump's rise in the polls, two assassination attempts, and loads of revelations about his new opponent's shortcomings, the stock price has slid from that high to $11.75, and each time it slid more, I doubled down and bought more at the cheaper price, which is bogging down my limited portfolio. Now it's finally going up, and at the start of business today rose by about 75 cents and is still rising. One possible explanation is that some rich, powerful person is deliberately shorting the security. And there's a regular rogue's gallery of rich Trump haters who might do so. Fortunately, we have some history to teach us a course of action. About a year or so ago, fat cats had decided to short a popular sporting goods store out of existence, and small-time investors on the Robin Hood platform put a stop to it, by consistently buying en masse the stock, forcing the price up. Their rebellion was duly punished, and Robin Hood put a stop to their uppitiness. But the lesson remains learned, and I propose we do so for our fearless leader's flagship stock as well. It's still at 12.53 a share or thereabouts, climbing up from a low of 11.75 this morning. So those of you who have money to invest, buy some DJT stock now, while it's still cheap. If enough people do so, it will drive the price up even further. Full disclosure. You'll also be bailing my stagnating margin out of the doldrums in a big way, giving me liquidity to venture on more investments, and grow my wealth, such as it is.

And that’s the chart that I use. It doesn’t directly follow the security, but the projected path of the security. Sort of like a futures contract without redemption date, large premium, or unlimited liability. So it’s fun. I make some money at it. But can only lose what’s invested.

About a year or so ago, fat cats had decided to short a popular sporting goods store out of existence, and small-time investors on the Robin Hood platform put a stop to it, by consistently buying en masse the stock, forcing the price up. Their rebellion was duly punished, and Robin Hood put a stop to their uppitiness. But the lesson remains learned, and I propose we do so for our fearless leader's flagship stock as well. It's still at 12.53 a share or thereabouts, climbing up from a low of 11.75 this morning. So those of you who have money to invest, buy some DJT stock now, while it's still cheap. If enough people do so, it will drive the price up even further. Full disclosure. You'll also be bailing my stagnating margin out of the doldrums in a big way, giving me liquidity to venture on more investments, and grow my wealth, such as it is.

I make some money at it. But can only lose what’s invested. They have investment counselors, but sometimes their recommendations are dead wrong. Also crypto, I forgot to mention. The Dems will make loud, shrill noises, until he divests. So he’ll divest just to shut them up. Then they’ll make loud, shrill noises about something else, and hopefully he’ll put his foot down about the BS then. At some point, you’ve got to let the toddler scream until he’s worn out.

Bitcoin Bitcoin has surged since crashing to September lows of around $52,000 as JPMorgan's chief executive leads a flurry of serious inflation warnings. Subscribe now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor and "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains" in the aftermath of bitcoin's halving earthquake! The bitcoin price has rocketed over the last two years, rocketing by over 200%, largely due to the BlackRock-led Wall Street bitcoin revolution (which is suddenly hurtling toward a fresh earthquake). Now, as details emerge of a secret meeting between Elon Musk and El Salvador's bitcoin-backing president Nayib Bukele, China has unleashed a flood of stimulus measures designed to prop up its stalling economy, hot on the heels of the U.S. Federal Reserve cutting interest rates and kicking off a global monetary policy easing cycle.

[+] depressed investor confidence in the country, potentially feeding into the bitcoin price and crypto market. People’s Bank of China governor Pan Gongsheng has announced a series of "bold" stimulus measures, cutting bank reserves by 50 basis points and reducing mortgage rates to spur economic growth. "I think these are pretty bold moves from authorities," Kyle Rodda, senior financial market analyst at Capital.Com, told Reuters. "It doesn't qualify as 'big bang' stimulus. It's mostly targeted at financial markets and supporting the banking system... Overall, for investors, it's a very bullish thing." "More and bolder easing measures could also be in store in the coming quarters," Vasu Menon, managing director of investment strategy at OCBC, added. The bitcoin price and wider crypto market has so far failed to move on the news out of China even as stocks across Asia soared to their highest in more than two and half years. "Bitcoin's lack of response to this news, juxtaposed against rallying Chinese indices, highlights that its current beta appears more tightly linked to Fed policy and U.S. markets, as evidenced by near two-year high correlations with U.S. stocks, particularly following last week's FOMC [Federal Open Market Committee] meeting," Rick Maeda, a Singapore-based research analyst at Presto Research, told Coindesk. Last week, the Fed's historical 0.5% interest rate cut pushed the bitcoin price sharply higher as traders braced for the beginning of a new liquidity cycle. The Federal Reserve interest rate cut and stimulus from China are predicted to trigger a bitcoin price surge over the next few years by some bullish investors.

"I still have a $1 million [bitcoin] price target," Arthur Hayes, a cofounder of bitcoin and crypto derivatives pioneer BitMex who went on to set up the Maelstrom investment fund, told Coindesk last week. "I'm more of a 2026, 2027 sort of person. Next year, we really get a ramp up in fiscal spending regardless of who wins the U.S. election. And if the U.S. dollar declines a lot, then China has room to enact stimulus as well and keep the yuan stable. And then you have the rest of the major central banks following in the footsteps of the Fed. They look at the Fed; they're easing so we can ease too." Hayes has previously said he expects a China "bazooka" combined with the Fed easing to create a "glorious" crypto bull market. One Community. Many Voices.

Fidelity's FBTC leads $4.5 million Bitcoin ETF inflow amidst mixed fund movements. On Sep. 23, Bitcoin ETFs saw mixed flows, totaling $4.5 million. Fidelity’s FBTC ETF led inflows with $24.9 million, followed by BlackRock’s IBIT with $11.5 million. Grayscale’s smaller BTC fund also added $8.4 million. However, this was offset by significant outflows of $40.3 million from Grayscale’s GBTC, which remains one of the largest Bitcoin ETFs in the market. Other major funds, including Bitwise’s BITB, Ark’s ARKB, Invesco’s BTCO, and others, showed no activity, with flows remaining flat. Ethereum ETFs experienced substantial net outflows, totaling a negative $79.3 million. Grayscale’s ETHE fund drove the bulk of the movement with significant outflows of $80.6 million, marking a sharp shift in investor sentiment. Bitwise’s ETHW was the only fund with inflows, recording $1.3 million, while all other Ethereum ETFs, including those from BlackRock, Fidelity, 21Shares, VanEck, Invesco, and Franklin, reported no inflows or outflows. The contrasting flows spotlight ongoing volatility and selective investor participation. Bitcoin ETFs saw pockets of demand, while Ethereum ETFs, particularly Grayscale’s, faced pronounced withdrawals. Also known as "Akiba," Liam is a reporter, editor and podcast producer at CryptoSlate.

Title: Amazon, ExxonMobil, Meta, Tesla, Others Labeled ‘Underminers of Democracy’

Time Published: 2024-09-24T03:47:04Z

A report by the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) is calling out some of the world’s biggest companies, saying they undermine democracy worldwide. The ITUC says its mission is “the promotion and defence of workers’ rights and interests, through international cooperation between trade unions, global campaigning and advocacy within the major global institutions.” Tune in: How Major U.S. Firms Got Branded as Undermining Democracy! The ITUC has published a list calling out the top seven “emblematic companies that benefit financially by continuing to violate trade union and human rights, monopolise media and technology, exacerbate climate catastrophe, and privatise public services. They represent a wider corporate world that protects and expands its own profits by undermining democracy.” The list includes: The organization then goes on to describe why each company made it on to the list. ITUC calls out Amazon for its repeated privacy violations, worker endangerment, and opposition to labor laws. The world’s largest online retailer and cloud computing service, and its fifth-largest employer, there is no industry or community Amazon and its subsidiaries have not adversely impacted. The company has become notorious for its union busting and low wages on multiple continents, monopoly in e-commerce, egregious carbon emissions through its AWS data centres, corporate tax evasion, and lobbying at national and international level. In the United States alone, where Amazon’s worker injury rate is twice as high as similar companies, the company has racked up more than US$250 million in fines for privacy, occupational health and safety, wage, and environmental violation cases filed by workers across sectors. Attempts to hold Amazon accountable to labour rights have led the company to challenge the constitutionality of the National Labor Relations Board in the U.S. In Canada, the company is trying to overturn provincial labour law. In Europe, Amazon was barred this year from lobbying within the European Parliament for its refusal to attend hearings on violations of worker rights in its warehouses, becoming only the second company in history to face such a sanction. Its refusal to negotiate with unions in Germany has resulted in a decade of strikes. In India, the company has admitted to breaching workplace safety standards in its warehouses. Blackstone Group makes the list for opposition to violations of consumer protection laws, violating employment laws, employing child labor, and harming the environment, including deforestation of the Amazon. Blackstone is well-known by climate justice advocates for its role in the rapid deforestation of the Amazon rainforest and huge investments in fossil fuel projects. In the UK, Blackstone reaped huge profits while saddling one of the country’s largest long-term care providers with insurmountable debt. Blackstone infamously profited from housing market speculation after the 2008 financial crisis and aggressively evicted workers after the Covid-19 pandemic. Blackstone and its subsidiaries have been penalised for competition, contracting, employment, financial and consumer protection violations to the tune of nearly US$300 million in one country alone. It was also the face of child labour in meatpacking, is known for its exorbitant fees to manage worker pensions, and has so far failed to sign up to a coalition-designed Private Equity Labor Rights Platform. In Brazil, it has been criticised for helping to privatise public infrastructure and corporatise agricultural land. Blackstone seems to believe that it – not voters – should determine public policy. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on housing has accused Blackstone of, “using its significant resources and political leverage to undermine domestic laws and policies that would in fact improve access to adequate housing.” ExxonMobil’s inclusion on the list should come as a surprise to no one, given the company’s long history of hiding its finding about the impact of fossil fuels on the environment. Perhaps the greatest example of Exxon’s disinterest in democratic deliberation was its corporate commitment of nearly four decades to conceal from the public its own internal evidence that climate change was real, accelerating, and driven by fossil fuel use while simultaneously financing far-right think tanks in the US and Europe to inject climate scepticism and denialism into the public discourse. While it altered its public position on climate change years ago, Exxon continues to lobby against meaningful climate policy and still promotes fossil fuel and plastics use to the detriment of communities around the world. It benefits from another entry on our list, Meta, by spreading right-wing propaganda in favour of fossil fuels. It finances the Republican Attorneys General Association, which has led efforts to pressure the US Supreme Court to throw out climate change lawsuits seeking damages from Exxon and its competitors. Glencore has a track record of flaunting the law, pleading guilty to various charges in a number of countries. The largest trader of commodities and the largest mining company in the world by revenue, Glencore controls or produces huge portions of the global supply of coal, zinc, cobalt, and other minerals, metals, fuels and foods. The company’s undermining of democracy is not in dispute, as it has in recent years pled guilty to committing bribery, corruption, and market manipulation in countries as varied as Venezuela, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Cote d’Ivoire, Nigeria, and South Sudan. The scale of Glencore’s global lobbying lays bare the organisational conviction that it, rather than the voting public, should determine policy. While it publicly shows itself to support measures such as the Paris Agreement and the UN Sustainable Development Goals, for years it has made use of right-wing consultants to spend “millions bankrolling a secret, globally coordinated campaign to prop up coal demand by undermining environmental activists, influencing politicians and spreading sophisticated pro-coal messaging on social media.” This self-serving posture is also exhibited in its efforts to undermine popular climate policy in the European Union, the United States, and South Africa. Meta’s role in politics and its ability to influence people, including its users falling victim to misinformation, has long made the company the target of critics and led to its inclusion on the list. The world’s largest social media company, Meta is the parent of Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Threads, and Messenger. Combined, these products have nearly four billion users – the same number of people estimated to be voting worldwide in 2024. The company’s scale, and its corporate behaviour, have led some to call it “a foreign state, populated by people without sovereignty, ruled by a leader with absolute power.” Meta’s algorithms can quite literally alter humanity’s perceptions of reality. Its revenue model exploits trillions of personalised data points to deliver highly effective advertising to its users. That has made it a perfect target for data breaches seized on by authoritarians and an ideal vessel for right-wing political parties to spread propaganda around the world. Violent, far-right militias in the US use Facebook to recruit new members. In Germany, the far-right AfD used Facebook to stoke anti-immigrant hatred and position itself for unprecedented success in June’s European parliamentary elections. While Tesla may be the world’s leading EV maker, that standing has come at the expense of workers rights, with the company engaging in a long history of combating unionization efforts. In Germany, Sweden, and the US, Tesla has aggressively violated the right to organise, refused to engage in collective bargaining, and provoked unprecedented strike action for its subversion of social dialogue, a pillar of industrial democracy in many European economies. Tesla’s hostility toward unions earned it a place on a list of Worst Union-Busters of 2023. Tesla’s factories have “reported ten times more safety violations than Nissan … despite the fact that Nissan built almost ten times as many cars over the same period.” But Tesla does not limit its efforts to weaken democratic norms in highly industrialised economies. Its supply chain relies on nickel mining companies that undermine consultation standards with local Indonesian communities and are deforesting so rapidly that flooding and water pollution threaten neighbourhoods. The company’s supply chain relies on another corporation on our list, Glencore, to mine copper and cobalt in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where child labour has allegedly been employed. The Vanguard Group makes the list for concentrating its power to such a degree that even its founder was worried about where the company was headed. One of the “Big Four” institutional investors in the world alongside BlackRock, Fidelity, and State Street, Vanguard’s holdings put it “into an extreme position of power” at many of the companies it funds and makes it “the voice that matters most among investors.” This concentration of power troubled even Vanguard’s late founder, John Bogle, who wrote in 2018 that “If historical trends continue, a handful of giant institutional investors will one day hold voting control of virtually every large US corporation.” Despite holding billions of dollars in worker money, Vanguard recently abandoned one of its most public commitments to environmental and social governance. After signing on to the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative in 2021, it left in 2022, bowing to pressure from its far-right friends and provoking a backlash from more than 1,000 of its more climate-friendly clients. The ITUC’s list, and the cases it makes, is a damning indictment of the included companies. The ITUC minces no words in calling out the seven companies for their actions. These companies deploy complex lobbying operations to undermine popular will and disrupt existing or nascent global policy that could hold them accountable. They are invariably led by ultra-wealthy individuals that support and finance far-right politicians and parties to further their own interests. When the far-right wins power, it discredits and defunds democratic global institutions; reduces taxes on the wealthy and on corporations; undercuts living wages; favours bilateral aid financing over multilateralism; and cracks down on human, trade union, and democratic rights, as evidenced by the ITUC’s Global Rights Index. If more organizations continue to shine a spotlight on the actions of the companies on the list, public perception could eventually force them to change how they do business.

Tesla’s factories have “reported ten times more safety violations than Nissan … despite the fact that Nissan built almost ten times as many cars over the same period.” But Tesla does not limit its efforts to weaken democratic norms in highly industrialised economies. Its supply chain relies on nickel mining companies that undermine consultation standards with local Indonesian communities and are deforesting so rapidly that flooding and water pollution threaten neighbourhoods. The company’s supply chain relies on another corporation on our list, Glencore, to mine copper and cobalt in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where child labour has allegedly been employed. The Vanguard Group makes the list for concentrating its power to such a degree that even its founder was worried about where the company was headed. One of the “Big Four” institutional investors in the world alongside BlackRock, Fidelity, and State Street, Vanguard’s holdings put it “into an extreme position of power” at many of the companies it funds and makes it “the voice that matters most among investors.” This concentration of power troubled even Vanguard’s late founder, John Bogle, who wrote in 2018 that “If historical trends continue, a handful of giant institutional investors will one day hold voting control of virtually every large US corporation.” Despite holding billions of dollars in worker money, Vanguard recently abandoned one of its most public commitments to environmental and social governance. After signing on to the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative in 2021, it left in 2022, bowing to pressure from its far-right friends and provoking a backlash from more than 1,000 of its more climate-friendly clients. The ITUC’s list, and the cases it makes, is a damning indictment of the included companies. The ITUC minces no words in calling out the seven companies for their actions. These companies deploy complex lobbying operations to undermine popular will and disrupt existing or nascent global policy that could hold them accountable. They are invariably led by ultra-wealthy individuals that support and finance far-right politicians and parties to further their own interests. When the far-right wins power, it discredits and defunds democratic global institutions; reduces taxes on the wealthy and on corporations; undercuts living wages; favours bilateral aid financing over multilateralism; and cracks down on human, trade union, and democratic rights, as evidenced by the ITUC’s Global Rights Index. If more organizations continue to shine a spotlight on the actions of the companies on the list, public perception could eventually force them to change how they do business.
