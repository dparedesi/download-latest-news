He later chose a unique role as a gay cyclist in the TV show 'Sweat' to stand out.

Title: Vanguard Executive Compares Bitcoin To A ‘Digital Labubu’ Even As Firm Allows Client Access To Crypto ETFs

A senior Vanguard executive has asserted that Bitcoin is a purely speculative asset, likening it to a collectible toy, even as the Wall Street behemoth opened the door to crypto-tied exchange-traded funds. Speaking during Bloomberg’s ETFs in Depth conference in New York on Thursday, Vanguard’s global head of quantitative equity, John Ameriks, said that Bitcoin lacked the cash flow and compounding traits the company sought when evaluating long-term investments. According to Ameriks, Bitcoin still resembles a speculative collectible rather than an asset meant to build long-term wealth. In fact, he characterized the world’s largest and oldest crypto as a “digital Labubu,” referencing the viral plush collectibles. “It’s difficult for me to think about Bitcoin as anything more than a digital Labubu,” the exec postulated, highlighting what he called the lack of clear evidence that the underlying blockchain technology provides long-lasting economic value. Bitcoin has long been likened to speculative manias and collectibles, including Dutch tulip bulbs and Beanie Babies. Detractors have pointed to those analogies to contend that Bitcoin’s price gains have been spurred more by speculation than by real-world use cases. Despite Ameriks’ dismissive view, he suggested that Bitcoin could find real-world use cases beyond market speculation in the future in scenarios of high inflation or political instability. The comments from Ameriks followed Vanguard’s announcement earlier this month, allowing its 50 million clients to access funds holding cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ether, Ripple’s XRP, and Solana. “We allow people to hold and buy these ETFs on our platform if they wish to do so, but they do so with discretion,” Ameriks noted, adding that even with that access, Vanguard will not offer clients “advice as to whether to buy or sell or which crypto tokens they ought to hold.” Vanguard had previously said it would steer clear of crypto-related products, including the spot BTC ETFs offered by rivals BlackRock and Fidelity. The firm’s decision to now allow digital assets on its platform demonstrates how the worlds of traditional finance and cryptocurrency are continuing to merge. Despite begrudgingly reversing course, Vanguard does not intend to roll out its own crypto ETFs. This is notable given that spot BTC funds have become BlackRock’s biggest revenue drivers.

Title: Bitcoin To Retest $85,000 Mark In Coming Days – Here’s Why
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-to-retest-85000-mark-in-coming-days/
Time Published: 2025-12-14T03:00:13Z

Amid a steady price rebound in the Bitcoin (BTC) market, popular market analyst with the X username KillaXBT is predicting another significant correction in the forthcoming days. In an X post on December 12, KillaXBT outlines a cautious market insight that suggests Bitcoin is headed for a price pullback. According to the renowned analyst, the premier cryptocurrency has consistently recorded an 8% price decline after the 14th day of the last five months. KillaXBT describes this observation as the 14th Pivot, which now holds important implications for Bitcoin in the short term. Since hitting a price bottom of $80,000 in late November, BTC has formed an ascending channel, recording a steady series of higher lows and higher highs. However, KillaXBT’s projection is expected to break this channel, potentially halting the nascent uptrend. Going by the recurring price pattern, the analyst states Bitcoin investors should anticipate a minimum 5% price decline after the 14th of December, hinting at a potential retest of the 85,000-$86,000 price zone. Given the asset’s broader bullish market structure, such a move may represent nothing more than a short-term pullback. However, the prolonged correction seen earlier in Q4 has already set a precedent, leaving room for another phase of deeper downside should momentum weaken. In another X post, KillaXBT shares more bearish projections of the Bitcoin market. This time, the seasoned analyst predicts the crypto market leader will hit a price bottom of $48,905 despite recent price gains. KillaXBT’s bottom target represents Bitcoin’s price as of the approval of the BlackRock IBIT ETF, alongside 11 other Bitcoin Spot ETFs in January 2024. This projection is likely due to the common rationale that the present bullish run has been heavily supported by institutional inflows. Notably, the Bitcoin Spot ETFs have been central to these institutional inflows, boasting total net assets of $119.18 billion. The BlackRock IBIT holds over half of this traction as the undisputed market leader with $71.03 billion in net assets and $62.68 billion in cumulative net inflows. If Bitcoin were to return to its pre-ETF approval price levels, it would imply an estimated 46% decline from current market prices. Such a move would likely signal a sharp reversal in institutional positioning, suggesting that sustained ETF outflows, rather than retail capitulation, could emerge as the primary catalyst for a renewed crypto winter. At press time, Bitcoin continues to trade at $90,348, reflecting a 2.18% decline. Featured image from Pexels, chart from Tradingview For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Ripple’s Brad Garlinghouse Shares Key Institutional Signal, Makes Bold XRP Prediction For 2026‬
URL: https://zycrypto.com/ripples-brad-garlinghouse-shares-key-institutional-signal-makes-bold-xrp-prediction-for-2026/

Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has outlined what he considers one of the clearest signs that institutional capital is finally entering the crypto market, despite recent volatility. Speaking at Binance Blockchain Week alongside Solana Foundation President Lily Liu and Binance CEO Richard Teng, Garlinghouse said XRP ETFs have already raised over $700 million in just a few weeks. According to Ripple’s CEO, that surge reflects pent-up demand from institutions that previously avoided the asset due to a lack of U.S. regulatory clarity. Garlinghouse emphasized that the shift in U.S. policy has been dramatically under-priced. With the world’s largest economy representing 22% of global GDP, the removal of long-standing regulatory hostility marks a critical turning point. Major financial firms, including Franklin Templeton, BlackRock, and even Vanguard, which once refused to touch crypto, are now entering the space. That situation fuels Garlinghouse’s strongest optimism for 2026. That said, Brad Garlinghouse noted that crypto still represents just 1–2% of the global ETF market. He dismissed concerns about short-term ETF outflows and declared there is “no chance” the asset class remains this small by 2026. For Ripple’s institutional brokerage arm, the trend is already visible: firms that stayed sidelined due to risk aversion or regulatory uncertainty are now beginning to “crawl, then walk, then run.” Moving on, Garlinghouse said the recent market turbulence has not scared institutions. “Definitely not,” he told the panel, arguing that volatility is pulling more interest in rather than pushing capital out. On the payments front, the Ripple CEO highlighted the company’s growing stablecoin business, which recently surpassed a $1 billion market cap and has secured approvals in Abu Dhabi, Dubai, and the DIFC. The company is seeing accelerating demand for stablecoin-based treasury flows, boosted further by upcoming U.S. legislation such as the GENIUS Act. Moreso, Ripple’s acquisition of GTreasury is reinforcing that momentum. Looking ahead, Garlinghouse expects meaningful U.S. regulatory legislation to pass in the first half of 2026, setting up what he believes could be a transformational year for XRP and the broader market.

Title: Vanguard Exec Likens Bitcoin to ‘Digital Labubu’ Even as Firm Opens ETF Trading Access

Vanguard’s global head of quantitative equity, John Ameriks, said bitcoin BTC$89,887.59 still resembles a speculative collectible more than an asset meant to build long-term wealth, comparing it to a “digital Labubu,” the plush toy that has become a popular collectible. Ameriks’ words came during Bloomberg’s ETFs in Depth conference in New York on Thursday, where he said bitcoin lacks the income, compounding, and cash-flow traits Vanguard seeks when it evaluates long-term investments. His dismissive stance comes as Vanguard just opened its platform to crypto exchange-traded funds, allowing its 50 million clients access to regulated investment vehicles from rivals like BlackRock and Fidelity. The asset management giant's begrudging embrace of crypto is a reversal of long-time skepticism towards the entire asset class. For years, Vanguard stood against offering cryptocurrency products to clients, reiterating that it saw digital assets as highly speculative and unaligned with its core investment philosophy. That view, according to Ameriks, apparently hasn’t changed. As a result, Vanguard does not plan to launch its own crypto-focused ETFs. The decision is notable as bitcoin ETFs have become BlackRock’s top revenue source. Still, after Vanguard saw crypto ETFs and funds “have been tested through periods of market volatility, performing as designed while maintaining liquidity,” the firm opened its brokerage platform to these products. Even with that access, Vanguard will not advise clients on whether to buy or sell crypto assets or which tokens to hold, Ameriks said. Ameriks said bitcoin could eventually show non-speculative value in certain conditions, such as high inflation or political instability, but he argued the evidence is still limited. “You’ve still got too short of a history,” he said.

Title: Surviving in ‘25: Was the year really as bad as it felt? - Liam Dann

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. US President Donald Trump. Photo / Carolyn Van Houten, The Washington Post THE FACTS How will we remember 2025? When it comes to the economy, the answer is: not fondly. It’s going to go down as the year of the recovery that didn’t happen. There is no question that the psychological blow of thinking an economic recovery had begun and then having it all dashed was substantial. It has cast a pall over the whole year, even though the data will show that we saw growth in the first quarter and that it (most likely) returned in the third and fourth quarters. We finally get third-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) numbers next week, and economists are expecting a strong bounce – perhaps as much as 1% for the quarter. We’ll also likely see revisions that show the terrible second quarter wasn’t as bad as we thought. We’ve had some promising data in the last few weeks that suggest the recovery has really gathered steam in the fourth quarter. Electronic card spending for November was much stronger than expected. So perhaps history will eventually show that 2025 wasn’t as bad as we thought it was. Unfortunately, how bad we thought it was is what counted while we were in it ... if that makes any sense. If we needed reasons to be gloomy, there was plenty of grim stuff – rising unemployment, business liquidations and stubborn inflation – to justify our mood. I should probably point out that this isn’t a preview for next week’s GDP release. This is officially my go at writing a year in review. It’s traditional in journalism to get these year-in-review pieces out early. No one wants to look back after Christmas. It’s more fun to speculate about the year ahead. Well, even more so this year, I reckon. There are plenty of businesses that will be more than happy to rule a line through this one. It’s the hope that kills you, people say – usually about their favourite sports team. So it was with the economy in 2025. But with what’s left of my weekly word count, let’s take a look at some of the highlights and lowlights. You can bet the Reserve Bank (RBNZ) will be relieved to see the back of 2025 after what has been, to quote the late great Queen, an annus horribilis (at least from an HR point of view). Controversy about the departure of Adrian Orr and the subsequent mess around the disclosure of information has been one of the biggest and most distracting economic stories of the year. The return of Donald Trump to the White House has also dominated news headlines. There have been so many big Trump headlines; some are saying the biggest, most impressive headlines in history. The big one that mattered most for New Zealand was Trump’s highly staged “Liberation Day” tariff show on the front lawn of the White House on April 2 (local time). With the weird pontification and bizarre mathematical workings, it might have been the year’s best comedy if it hadn’t delivered a very real blow to a global economy that didn’t need any more blows. Liberation Day coincided with the arrival of the second financial quarter, the one that delivered our GDP growth shocker – a 0.9% quarterly contraction. The Government and the RBNZ used the tariff shock as an explanation for the slump, but I’m yet to meet an economist who buys that line. New Zealand hasn’t had an issue with its export earnings in 2025. We’ve had record prices for meat, dairy and kiwifruit. Our economic issues have primarily been local. An exodus of Kiwis and a fall in arrivals have resulted in a crash in the net migration rate. That’s created a headwind for the property market, which has failed to recover. In fact, in Auckland and Wellington, property prices have kept falling. Consumers stopped spending and concentrated on saving and paying down debt – slowing the pass-through of interest rate cuts to retailers. Both business and consumer confidence (or mojo, as the PM calls it) went missing in action. The tariffs may have initially rattled local confidence too, but they quickly offered up a silver lining. They have reassured and reminded the world that we shouldn’t take anything Trump says at face value. Taco (Trump always chickens out) gets my vote for acronym of the year. Within weeks of Liberation Day, Trump was forced to back down on his hardline stance with China. Given China’s dominance of the vital rare-earth minerals trade, it always held all the cards. The delays to the US-China trade war showdown have kept coming. But despite interim tariffs in excess of 30% on Chinese goods, China has just reported a record US$1 trillion ($1.7t) trade surplus with the world. The standoff has also lifted Chinese President Xi Jinping’s popularity as he rides a wave of nationalist sentiment. As they say in China: Chuan Jianguo. Literally that means “Trump the nation-builder”, although in context, it’s a sarcastic play on the Maga slogan “Make America Great Again”. I visited China in September, and naturally, they showed me all the good stuff – so I might be a bit bullish. China’s had its problems in 2025 – an ongoing property slump, low consumer confidence, high youth unemployment – but losing the trade war has not been one of them. Faced with rising inflation at home, Trump has also been forced to back down on tariffs for meat, dairy and horticultural products. Financial markets have been a bright spot for the US economy in 2025 – underpinned by a frighteningly rapid artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. Wall Street has wobbled at times. But as we head into the silly season, financial markets look to have shaken off any fears we’re in an AI bubble. Big investors, like US investment giant BlackRock, have decided that the high-tech revolution is genuinely transformational and the hype is justified. Whether it’s good for humanity is another issue, but our KiwiSaver accounts may be safe to look at for a while yet. There’s still time for things to go wrong in 2025, of course. It might be all over bar the shouting, but sometimes the shouting can be consequential. We’ll see. I’ve got one more Sunday column left in me this year. Hopefully, the road is clear for a look ahead at what 2026 might bring ... Liam Dann is business editor-at-large for the NZ Herald.

Title: Brazil’s Largest Asset Manager Recommends Investors Put Up to 3% of their Money in Bitcoin to Hedge Against FX, Market Shocks

Brazil’s largest privately-owned asset manager, Itáu Asset Management, has recommended investors allocate 1% to 3% of their portfolios to bitcoin BTC$89,887.59. In a year-end note, Renato Eid, head of beta strategies and responsible investment for Itaú Asset Management, argued that bitcoin’s lack of correlation with traditional local assets makes it a useful diversification tool. The note echoes the bitcoin allocations recommended by other major asset managers. Earlier this month, Bank of America greenlit wealth advisors to recommend a BTC allocation of up to 4%, while BlackRock has pointed to 2%. Eid emphasized a measured approach, not turning crypto into the centerpiece of a portfolio but using it as a complementary asset that can help absorb shocks from currency depreciation and global volatility. “The idea is not to make cryptoassets the core of the portfolio but to include them as a complementary component — sized appropriately to the investor’s risk profile,” Eid wrote. This year, bitcoin surged to a record near $125,000 before falling back to around $90,000. For local investors, the ride was even bumpier due to currency fluctuations. Products like BITI11, a bitcoin ETF traded in Brazil, saw their performance in reais affected by the weakening fiat currency. But in periods of stress, such as late 2024, the global nature of BTC provided some insulation. Eid warned against trying to time the market and suggested a disciplined, long-term mindset. A small, steady exposure to bitcoin, he says, can act as a partial hedge and offer access to global returns, especially as traditional asset correlations become less reliable. “It calls for moderation and discipline: set a strategic slice (for example, 1%–3% of the total portfolio), keep a long-term horizon and resist the temptation to react to short-term noise,” Eid wrote.

Title: Why Binance’s Bitcoin Reserves Keep Falling – And Why It’s Actually Bullish‬

Bitcoin reserves on Binance have fallen to their lowest level in five years, according to new data from CryptoQuant. Despite BTC hovering near $93,000, analysts say the decline is not a bearish signal. Instead, it reflects deeper structural shifts that are typically associated with strong market conditions, not weakening ones. The largest driver behind the outflows is the accelerating move toward self-custody. As prices rise, long-term holders and high-net-worth investors increasingly transfer their BTC to cold wallets, removing potential sell pressure from exchanges. This pattern, historically typical in bull markets, signals confidence and long-term conviction rather than fear. That said, the rapid growth of spot Bitcoin ETFs builds on this. U.S. issuers, including BlackRock, Fidelity, and, more recently, Vanguard, are attracting heavy inflows. However, these assets are custodied outside centralized exchanges. As institutional capital moves into ETF structures, exchange reserves naturally shrink. Analysts view this as a structural sign of institutional adoption rather than distress. A third factor is the recent derivatives reset. The late-November sell-off triggered sweeping liquidations, particularly during Asian trading hours, reducing margin deposits and the amount of BTC held on Binance. This dynamic is short-term and mechanical, rather than reflective of a broader shift in sentiment. Binance’s recent compliance upgrades have also prompted some users to rebalance holdings. However, this represents regulatory normalization rather than negative pressure. Overall, a decline in exchange reserves typically tightens the circulating supply. That environment has historically supported medium- to long-term appreciation. The current trend aligns with a market in re-accumulation mode. In other news, corporate adoption and AI-driven models fuel forecasts above $150,000, and a break below the $102.6K support could validate bearish technical setups. Moreover, CoinMarketCap data shows that macro and technical conditions are supportive. BTC has rebounded 11% from November’s $82K low, helped by “seller exhaustion” after roughly $19 billion in liquidations cleared excess leverage. A bullish MACD crossover and neutral RSI suggest room for upward momentum, with resistance at $101K and support at $86.3K.

Title: BlackRock's head of talent acquisition reveals how AI has changed what he looks for in applicants

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. If you want to work at BlackRock, make sure you're using AI — just not too much. Nigel Williams, BlackRock's global head of talent acquisition, said that AI is shifting his hiring priorities, and that fluency with the technology is now key to any strong application. However, he warns against depending on it in the interview process. "We want to hire people that are curious, that understand that AI is here," he told Business Insider, especially because it's embedded in functions across the world's biggest asset manager. The strongest applicants can demonstrate that they are both digitally native and comfortable with various AI tools, and that they're curious about future capabilities. Young talent is "upskilling itself to meet the moment," Williams said, since applicants without a computer science background often demonstrate AI proficiency. Everyone, he added, will need to have a basic understanding of prompt engineering and how to question AI outputs. "In this age of AI, the talent skills that I think we need more than ever are people that are curious, have a questioning mindset, and are willing to not just trust what the model puts out there, but also make sure we're continuing to pressure test that," he said. Strong interpersonal and relationship-building skills are also becoming even more important, he said. Williams said that his team is figuring out how to assess applicants' AI abilities and is mindful of making sure people without tech backgrounds don't feel intimidated. He's interested in how people use the technology in their personal, academic, or work lives, and said his team is still fine-tuning how to assess that in the interview process. Despite Williams' new focus on how applicants engage with AI, he's not using it to screen candidates. As of now, he uses AI to schedule interviews. There's such a thing as too much AI in the application process, though. Williams said recruiters and hiring managers have told people ahead of an interview not to use an AI tool, sometimes to little avail. "It is quite common. You will sometimes see people looking to the left or the right. Our interviewing teams, if they're in the middle of doing that, will pick up on that and be able to say, 'Hey, we do want to make sure that you're staying focused,'" Williams said. BlackRock employs around 24,600 people in more than 30 countries, according to a November 5 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Some 21,100 people worked at the firm as of the end of 2024, according to that year's annual report. BlackRock has launched Asimov, an agentic AI platform for its equity business. At the annual New York Times DealBook Summit this week, its CEO, Larry Fink, said that there will be "some huge winners and huge failures" with the technology. Jump to

Title: ‘Digital labubu’: Why Vanguard still refuses to endorse Bitcoin

Can Bitcoin thrive when its biggest gatekeepers refuse to believe in it? Bitcoin retreated from its recent peak as selling pressure returned across the broader market. At press time, BTC traded near $92,000, extending a drawdown from its recent high, according to Bloomberg data. The pullback revived familiar concerns around Bitcoin’s boom-and-bust cycles, even as institutional access continued to expand. The latest weakness coincided with sharp criticism from Vanguard, one of the world’s largest asset managers. Despite opening its platform to allow clients to trade spot Bitcoin [BTC] ETFs, the firm doubled down on its skepticism. Speaking at Bloomberg’s ETFs in Depth event in New York, John Ameriks, Vanguard’s Global Head of Quantitative Equity, directly addressed the question of Bitcoin’s investment merit, dismissing the asset with a mocking comparison. He described the world’s largest cryptocurrency as a “digital Labubu,” referring to the viral elf-like plush toy. Ameriks used this comparison to reinforce Vanguard’s core view: Bitcoin produces “no income, no compounding, and no cash flow.” As a result, the $12 trillion asset manager treats it as a “collectible rather than a productive asset.” Moreover, Ameriks strengthened his argument by saying the firm has seen “no proof that the technology behind it offers lasting economic value.” His analogy continues a tradition of critics comparing Bitcoin to speculative manias, such as 17th-century Dutch tulips and 1990s Beanie Babies. These comparisons suggest that Bitcoin’s value is driven by scarcity narratives and the “greater fool theory,” rather than intrinsic utility or cash flows. The irony of Amerik’s comments is starkly highlighted by the dramatic policy shift that preceded them. Recently, Vanguard, under the leadership of newly appointed CEO Salim Ramji, a former BlackRock executive with a background in crypto, reversed its years-long resistance to digital assets. The firm, managing approximately $12 trillion in assets, allows clients to trade crypto-focused ETFs that hold coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum [ETH], Ripple [XRP], and Solana [SOL] on its brokerage platform, effectively placing them alongside gold and other mainstream assets. Ameriks said the decision followed the January 2024 debut of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which helped stabilize market infrastructure and liquidity. However, he emphasized that Vanguard offered access without endorsement or investment guidance. “We allow people to hold and buy these ETFs on our platform if they wish to do so, but they do so with discretion. We’re going to not give them advice as to whether to buy or sell, or which crypto tokens they ought to hold.” Vanguard’s decision, therefore, represents a profound paradox at the heart of the maturing crypto market. The world’s second-largest asset manager began offering access to crypto ETFs and related mutual funds to its more than 50 million brokerage customers on the 2nd of December. This monumental policy shift, which dramatically reversed Vanguard’s anti-crypto stance in 2024, was driven by rising client demand. Andrew Kadjeski, head of brokerage and investments at Vanguard, said the ETF structure had “proven resilient during volatility” and maintained robust liquidity. At the same time, Vanguard mocks Bitcoin as a “digital Labubu” and avoids launching its own crypto products, showing it wants to meet demand without endorsing the asset.

Title: 'Time for gloves off': Asking religious orders nicely to pay redress hasn't worked, says Bacik

IT’S TIME TO take the gloves off and force religious orders to pay redress to their victims, according to Labour leader Ivana Bacik. Her party has put forward a Bill that seeks to enact landmark legislation to ensure that religious institutions, associated trusts, and other unincorporated organisations be held liable for historic child sexual abuse committed in their care. Tánaiste Simon Harris, when Taoiseach, said he expected those who speak Christianity to practice it, stating that the government has “levers” to ensure the religious orders pay up. He told The Journal last year that he had asked the Attorney General to draft legal advice for government about what mechanisms can be deployed or what legislation could be introduced to make sure that institutions have to contribute towards redress. However, since then, there has been no progress with the legislation. Bacik said in her previous life as a barrister, she represented many survivors of abuse in industrial schools, and she described the residential institutions redress board as “a flawed process” that has been subject to much critique. “One of the key issues was that the religious orders simply were not not paying their share of the redress… what has happened over decades is that religious orders have transferred their assets to lay-run trusts,” she said. Advertisement An example is the government-established Mother and Baby Institutions Payment Scheme, which sought for religious bodies to contribute around €270m to the costs. However, only two of eight religious bodies linked to Mother and Baby Homes in Ireland offered to contribute. The Sisters of Bon Secours offered €12.97m, while the Daughters of Charity of St Vincent de Paul proposed contributing a building to the scheme. Since then, there is a whole new cohort of people who have come forward with claims of abuse, with Bacik mentioning David and Mark Ryan, who were featured in the RTÉ’s Doc on One programme ‘Blackrock Boys’. In more recent times, claims have “absolutely exploded”, said Bacik, noting that the new scoping inquiry into sexual abuse in schools run by religious orders identified 42 religious orders, over 300 schools and 3,000 allegations. “And that’s just the tip of the iceberg.” “So we drafted a bill to enable proceedings to be taken against an unincorporated body, which is the legal status of a religious order, so that survivors or the State can pursue for unpaid redress,” she said. Bacik said there shouldn’t be a delay in taking action, stating that she believes this sort of legislation can run parallel to the Commission of Investigation into the Handling of Historical Child Sexual Abuse in Schools, which is ongoing. The commission will investigate the handling of allegations or concerns of historical child sexual abuse in all day and boarding schools in Ireland, including special schools, which occurred between 1927 and 2013. “I’m disappointed that the lack of action by government, because, in fact, I spoke in the Dáil two years ago on this, and the then-minister said he was very interested, and said that he would go to the Attorney General and look for advice… nothing’s happened since the scoping inquiry was established,” she said. Related Reads €86 million cash in the bank, but the majority of religious organisations haven't offered any redress Redacted Lives: Catch up on our documentary series about Mother and Baby Homes Redacted Lives: Why survivors felt let down by the Commission into Mother and Baby Homes “For decades, successive governments and ministers have gone cap in hand to the religious orders, and frankly, it’s time for gloves off. No more of this asking nicely, because the religious orders are digging their heels in. They’re protecting their assets, and it’s just not good enough. “We need this legal mechanism to be able to get behind these legal entities, and be able to secure a redress for survivors. We know the wealth religious orders and their trusts are sitting on is huge,” the Labour leader said. The Journal reported earlier this year that almost all religious orders in Ireland have millions of euros in cash and assets. The eight religious bodies with historical involvement in mother and baby homes have combined net assets of €1.32 billion and cash deposits of €86 million. In a statement from the Department of Education regarding where progress is when it comes to legislation, a spokesperson said the scoping inquiry into historical sexual abuse in day and boarding schools run by religious orders, a Commission of Investigation has been established by the government. They noted that inquiry’s report also recognised the significance of the issue of redress for survivors and their expressed wish that those running schools where child sexual abuse occurred should be held accountable financially. “It recommended that consideration be given by the government to establishing a redress scheme for survivors. The high-level Inter Departmental Group (IDG) established to advise Government on the recommendations of the Scoping Inquiry also recognised redress as an important element of accountability for survivors and advised in its report that, based on knowledge of other schemes in the State and beyond, further detailed research and data analysis work needs to be undertaken on the consideration of any potential redress scheme that may be established in the future. “This work is ongoing and will continue in parallel to the work of the Commission, which does not have a role in relation to redress. “Given the complex issues involved, it is clear that further analysis and significant legal consideration will be required in assessing any proposed legislation to be brought forward in this regard,” the concluded.

The Bateman Cup will have a new name on the trophy after Clontarf host Ballynahinch in the final at Castle Avenue on Saturday (kick-off 4pm) in a game that also doubles up as a Division 1A match and will be televised live on irishrugby+). Clontarf, unbeaten at home this season and defending 1A champions, are in their first Bateman final in a decade. Former UCD back three player Ross Deegan is fit again and starts on the wing, with Hugo Lennox at fullback, meaning Tadhg Bird and Alex O’Grady each shift to midfield. Up front, Andy Wood has picked an unchanged front five with Alex Soroka back from Leinster duty and the fit-again Jordan Coghlan both restored to the backrow. Hinch, in their first final, are also seeking a first win over ‘Tarf, who have completed the double over them in each of the last four seasons, for the first time since 2020. Paul Kerr moves from inside centre to outhalf in the absence of James Humphreys, who is on the bench for Ulster, tighthead Tom McAllister and number eight Bradley Luney return among five changes all told. The other four matches kick off at 2.30pm, with leaders St Mary’s (33 pts) hosting Lansdowne in third (23 pts). They welcome back fit-again talisman Conor Dean, with the prolific Mick O’Gara reverting to “12″ and Dan Goggin to “8″. Lansdowne promote scrumhalf James Kenny and inside centre Tom Daly, while Bobby Sheehan reverts to blindside in a new backrow alongside Ross O’Neill and Barry Fitzpatrick. After slipping to fourth following successive defeats, Terenure (25pts) head to Ollie Campbell Park to face Old Belvedere in eighth for a first AIL meeting since 2017. Chris Cosgrave moves to outhalf and Adam La Grue to fullback, with Connacht centre John Devine, all-time leading try scorer Craig Adams and scrumhalf Griffin Culver all restored. Ben Blaney is recalled and Harrison Brewer reverts to lock. Although Young Munster will welcome Conor Bartley’s call-up for Munster, Ger Slattery still retains all but three of the side which beat Terenure last week when they host Nenagh. UCD, boosted by last week’s 43-38 win at Lansdowne, have Andrew Osborne back on the right wing for the visit of Cork Constitution, who have won their last two and whose only change is a rotation at hooker, where Billy Scannell starts and Danny Sheahan is on the bench. In 2A and 2B, the AIL’s last unbeaten sides, MU Barnhall and Galwegians, are at home to Galway Corinthians and Skerries. Due to pitch conditions the AIL Junior Cup semi-final being played tomorrow between Seapoint and Athy will now be played at St Michael’s College, Dublin 4 on their 4G pitch.

Title: Is testosterone the quick fix for women in midlife?

Humanity has always chased the promise of renewed youth. From ancient myths about the fountain of life to modern Silicon Valley regimes of supplements, sensors and self-tacking biohackers, the supposed elixir may change over time, but the desire for eternal youth remains the same. Today it appears everywhere, and it is often split along gendered lines. For women, the pursuit tends to be aesthetic, shaped by a culture that treats ageing as a flaw to be corrected via Botox, fillers, or – increasingly among actresses barely in their mid-30s – a facelift. Men, meanwhile, are urged to optimise. An entire industry of podcasts, tech devices and protocols encourages them to track their biomarkers, adapt their sleep cycles, and follow elaborate nutritional codes. It’s a thriving market built on the belief the body, ageing, time itself can all be mastered and controlled with enough science, discipline and money. Into this landscape enters a new supposed miracle tonic for women: testosterone. It may be a hormone as old as time, but it’s being worshipped with a new fervour. Influencers and wellness clinics are peddling unregulated, high-dose testosterone to women, promising not just heightened libido but sharper focus, renewed purpose and a vitality dormant for years. Some of the stories sound almost mythic. Women describe bounding out of bed, lifting heavier weights, rediscovering sexual desire, and feeling newly energised at work and at home. In one recent New York Times piece, women described sex going from “How about never?” to six times a week; marriages transformed, energy levels electrified, all apparently down to testosterone. The problem is, most of the claims about testosterone are simply not borne out by evidence. Step away from the viral testimonies and influencer marketing spiels and into the consulting rooms of clinicians who specialise in hormonal care, and the story of testosterone becomes far more measured, more grounded, more wary. This research-backed, evidence-based medical view is not anti-testosterone; it’s just anti-magic. Though long framed as the defining male hormone, testosterone is no more exclusively masculine than oestrogen is exclusively feminine; both circulate in all bodies, and both matter profoundly. “Testosterone is the third hormone that your ovaries make, along with oestrogen and progesterone,” explains Dr Caoimhe Hartley, the clinical lead in women’s medicine at the newly opened Blackrock Health Women’s Health Centre. “It has an impact on bone density, muscles, probably cognition and sexual function, and that is where libido comes in. All these hormones do multiple things; they are not isolated to one usefulness.” What testosterone does not do is plummet dramatically at menopause, despite the common misconception. “There is no study that has shown any change over natural menopause,” says Prof Susan Davis, an endocrinologist at Monash University whose work has shaped global understanding of female testosterone. “Testosterone blood levels decline slowly from the age of about 20 through to the age of about 60,” she explains. Over those 40 years, she says, “on average, normal women will have about a 50 per cent decline.” Then, unexpectedly, levels start to creep up again from about 60. “It is changing with age, not menopause.” This distinction matters because it reframes midlife experiences. Changes that women may experience in metabolism, energy and mood are often misattributed to a sudden drop in testosterone, when the real cause may be the cumulative effects of ageing, stress, workload and emotional demands. But if testosterone drops over time and these emotional and embodied changes are experienced, a question naturally arises: does putting more testosterone into the body help? For premenopausal women, the answer right now is simply: we do not know. Two trials have hinted at some possible benefits for women in their late 30s and early 40s, “but the studies are too small to have any degree of confidence”, Davis says. Another trial is planned, but for now, “there is no good evidence that giving premenopausal women testosterone will be beneficial”. For postmenopausal women, the picture is clearer, though still limited. “All the published studies show that the only evidence of benefit is for postmenopausal women who are bothered by low libido,” Davis says. Her own meta-analysis of 36 trials involving 8,480 women found consistent improvements in desire, arousal, orgasm and overall sexual satisfaction. Though more modest than the accounts of teenage boy-levels of sexual desire experienced in women on high doses, these research-backed improvements were meaningful. “The beneficial effects for postmenopausal women shown in our study extend beyond simply increasing the number of times a month they had sex,” she says. “Many women who are sexually active report dissatisfaction, so increasing the frequency of a positive sexual experience from never or occasionally to once or twice a month can improve self-image and reduce concerns and distress.” Hartley sees the same patterns clinically. In Ireland, doctors can prescribe testosterone for women, but only off-label and only in carefully selected cases, such as postmenopausal women distressed by low libido. Because no female-specific product is licensed here, clinicians like Hartley rely on precisely titrated-down doses of male testosterone gels, monitored with blood tests to keep levels within a normal female range. She prescribes testosterone when low libido is causing distress, usually after menopause or after surgical removal of the ovaries. “It makes a bit of physiological sense,” she says of its use following surgical menopause, “but it is still for low libido and nothing else”. Beyond this specific use for improving libido for older or postmenopausal women, the evidence around the benefits of testosterone therapy for women fades. “No benefits have been shown for cognition, bone mineral density, body composition, muscle strength or psychological wellbeing at physiological doses,” Davis says of the clinical trials to date. “There simply isn’t evidence.” If testosterone’s proven benefits are relatively modest, why do some women who’ve taken it sound as if they have been converted to a new faith? Part of the answer is placebo. “There is a huge placebo effect, and everybody is in complete denial of this placebo effect,” Davis says. She points to a company that developed a testosterone gel for women and then ran two large trials of libido, each with 500 participants. “Testosterone improved libido, but not better than placebo,” she says. In her own 800-woman trial of a testosterone patch, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, women on testosterone had better sexual function than those on placebo. But when the team buried validated wellbeing questionnaires inside the study, they found no difference in general wellbeing at all. Hartley encounters the anecdotal power of testosterone every day. “I have patients who will come back and say, ‘I went on testosterone and my brain fog improved’ – and I am not in their brain, I cannot tell them that they are wrong.” The problem is that individual stories, which are very real to the woman telling them, are not the same as evidence. “How do you remove all the other things that may have helped? How do we know it is not placebo?” Hartley asks. “That is why we do studies.” But when women are looking for answers and hear one or two stories saying, ‘This transformed my life’, the effect is infectious. “It is human nature to want to believe it,” Hartley says. This gap between evidence and promise is sharpened by what happens outside regulated medical practice. In the US, an increasingly booming, unregulated industry of influencers and wellness clinics is offering female clients testosterone pellets and gels at doses that take women well beyond a normal female range for the hormone. At those levels, the side effects can be alarming: scalp hair loss, unwanted facial hair, acne, irritability, voice deepening, clitoral enlargement, and surges of arousal that disrupt daily life. Some of these side effects, like clitoral enlargement and voice changes, can be irreversible. Hartley notes that such dramatic changes “really should only occur if your testosterone level is bumped outside of a normal female range” – yet in unregulated settings, that boundary is routinely crossed. In countries like the United Kingdom or Australia, women have access to a licensed female-specific testosterone cream that allows safe, standardised dosing. In countries like the US or Ireland, without such a product, the gap between evidence-based prescribing and unregulated hormonal experimentation is widening, leaving women vulnerable to treatments that promise transformation but bypass the safeguards of medical care. “Knowing that this is an option that might help them, women are forced to use either compounded therapies or try microdose male options,” Davis says of countries without an approved product. “That is really where things go out the window, because it is very difficult to safely dose using very concentrated male formulations.” In her view, “the best thing to protect women is a regulated product”, one tailored to female physiology. Hartley would welcome the UK’s new female-specific cream for similar reasons. It contains the same active ingredient as existing male gels, she notes, just at a concentration and formulation that makes it easier to apply in tiny doses. Regulation, though, is not enough on its own – doctors need to understand the drug and how best to help their patients. For Hartley, the safeguard is information. “The more we have well-educated healthcare professionals at every level,” she says, “the more we are passing that on to women.” She wants GPs and specialists who are “well armed with information on what is evidence-based and what is rubbish”, so that they can help patients sift through hype and anecdote. Both Hartley and Davis think the fervour around testosterone says as much about the state of women’s lives as it does about the hormone itself. “I think women are sick of their symptoms being dismissed,” Davis says. “And when someone says this will make you feel better, of course, they want to take it. I get that, and I think that is perfectly reasonable.” Davis’s team has documented the decline in women’s quality of life at mid-age. Despite a huge amount of cultural discourse focusing on the so-called male loneliness epidemic, the documented mental health struggles of middle-aged women remain unacknowledged. “Women are suffering,” she says. “We have shown in our latest work that midlife wellbeing has gone down compared to 10 years ago. There is a real decline.” Davis explains the multitude of factors affecting women, noting: “This is the sandwich generation. Women trying to ‘have it all’: have children, take care of ageing parents, have work, have work-life balance, have financial stability. These are enormous pressures.” Depression rates are high, distress is high, and time is scarce. Hartley is watching the same pressures play out in Irish consulting rooms. “You see how much women are carrying,” she says. “It is no wonder their libido is low or that they feel flat or foggy or depleted. That is not a pathology. It is life.” Amid all the stresses affecting women, it thus becomes necessary to be careful of how we speak about women and low libido, in order not to pathologise a lack of desire that may be natural or due to a host of interlocking external factors, or to risk reinforcing damaging ideas about women owing their bodies and sexual availability to others. Neither doctor wants to minimise the distress of women whose sexual desire has vanished. Both prescribe testosterone in carefully selected cases, understanding the stakes for relationships and for individual self-esteem. “Our own research has shown that if women themselves personally have poor sexual wellbeing, that impacts them personally in their general wellbeing and their relationships,” Davis says. “So I prescribe testosterone for women with low libido. I am not anti-testosterone.” But what does concern Davis and Hartley is how the issue of women’s libido is often medicalised or framed. Hartley notes how many women come in apologising, or framing their lack of desire as a personal failure or a dereliction of duty to their partners. “Women come in saying, ‘Oh my God, my poor husband, my poor partner’,” says Hartley, who is always clear in redirecting them. “I say, ‘Your partner is not my patient’.” The real question is whether the woman herself is distressed. “It’s really important to not stick it on the list as something that has to be fixed. Low libido is not a disease,” says Hartley, who notes that it is a normal evolution for spontaneous sexual desire to reduce as you get older. ”That is universal. There is nothing wrong with you if that happens.” Davis notes that often, low libido is a “multifactorial condition”, and she points out that the guidelines from the International Society for the Study of Women’s Sexual Health set out a process of care that requires clinicians to look first at depression, relationship dynamics, medications, trauma, pain and vaginal health before they “jump in saying testosterone is going to be the fix”. Underpinning all of this, both the hope and the caution, is a simple fact: there is not enough research into women’s health, which leaves us without the data that women deserve. “The future, hopefully, is research,” Hartley says. Without larger, longer, better trials, she and her colleagues cannot give women the clear answers they want about benefits and risks. Davis has spent four decades trying to generate that data and sounds, at times, weary. Getting funding is brutally hard, she says; she can spend “up to 30 per cent” of her working time writing grant applications. When money does come through, another hurdle appears. “Trying to get women to go into clinical trials is an absolute no,” she says. “They are all too busy, busy.” Her team is about to start two large new studies, one looking at testosterone’s effects on muscle and bone, the other at bone and sexual function, both including wellbeing questionnaires. She welcomes the increased interest but insists that until the trials report, the honest answer to many questions will remain “we do not know”. That is not a comfortable message in a culture that wants a quick fix for midlife female exhaustion and desire. It is, however, the only message that treats women as adults and demands better for them in the long term. So what should an Irish woman do, sifting through a wave of hyped-up Instagram adverts about testosterone pellets and listicles of anecdotes about life-changing results? “Keep expectations realistic,” Davis says. If you are going to try testosterone, she urges, treat it as a time-limited trial, not a new identity. Do not try to treat bone loss, muscle fatigue or life itself with testosterone. “Testosterone is not the answer for life.” Hartley, for her part, hopes women will come in to talk, not arrive convinced that there is only one solution. “If they are symptomatic, if they have low libido and it is bothering them, and they want to have a discussion with their GP about it, do that,” she says. But she also wants them to hear something that often gets lost in the hype: “You are not broken.” She’s right. There is nothing inherently wrong about wanting sex less as you age. There is also nothing shameful about wanting more. But there is something deeply shameful about a society that devalues women; refuses to invest in research about their physical or emotional wellbeing; pathologises them for ageing and constantly tells them that they are not enough, only to try then make money selling them an unsafe, unregulated “cure”. Women deserve acceptance, accurate information and autonomy, not another marketplace built on their insecurity. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

I am fortunate enough to celebrate Christmas twice each year, enjoying a Danish feast featuring pork and duck on Christmas Eve and the traditional Irish turkey dinner the following day. In the past, I did not open up my finest wines, but now the children have grown older so I am happy to serve some very nice wine. Usually, we enjoy a good mature Bordeaux on Christmas Eve, and a nice pinot noir or cool climate syrah on Christmas Day. I will cover sparkling wine next week, but a glass of something fizzy is a great way to get proceedings started and can be drunk throughout the meal. This is the time to open some of the fortified traditional Christmas wines. I also make room for a dessert wine of some sort. This year it will be the Château des Arroucats (€18.95, Mitchell & Son). I will certainly open a bottle of Amontillado sherry as well as a bottle of Port. I will then alternate between an after-dinner glass of sherry with cheese and walnuts one evening, and a glass of Port the next, either with cheese or a generous slice of Christmas cake. My sherry will be a bottle of Lustau Tabanco Amontillado (€23.95, Mitchell & Son) and the Port a late bottled vintage, Niepoort LBV (€28-30, independents). If that is outside your budget, try the Armilar LBV Port (Lidl €14.99). O’Briens has a big range of wines on offer, including those in its fine wine sale which started on December 1st. I have featured the refreshing Picpoul de Pinet (€12.99) before, as well as the classic Brocard Chablis (€22.99). I am a big fan of the Begude wines and would also be tempted by the very well-priced Etoile Chardonnay (€18.99). From the reds, the Château des Léotins (€11.99) offers good value, and would go with red meats or goose. The classic Cru Bourgeois Chateau Saint Bonnet Médoc 2018 (€17.99) is a step up in price and quality. The Seguin Manuel Bourgogne Pinot Noir (€27.49) would be a good choice for turkey and trimmings. Lastly, a small glass of the honeyed Les Carmes de Rieussec (€18.99 per half-bottle) would be a nice end to the meal. For fans of sauvignon, Aldi has the fruit-filled Touraine Sauvignon Blanc – very good value at €9.99. If you fancy trying something different, its Austrian Orange Wine (€11.99) is full of exotic (and orange) fruits with a light tannic bite on the finish. For your Christmas dinner you could either go for the light, fruit filled Specially Selected Fleurie (€13.99) or the more powerful rounded Specially Selected Cairanne (€11.99). From Lidl, I would recommend three white wines; the lemon-scented Rías Baixas Albariño Salne Val (€11.99), the crisp dry Fiano Salento (€10.99) and the luscious Origen Roussanne Reserva from Chile (€8.99). My pick of the Lidl reds for Christmas dinner includes the ripe and full-bodied Pure Grenache (€11.99), and the ever-popular Valpolicella Ripasso (€10.99) Traditionalists might prefer the Ermita Rioja Crianza (€13.99). A post shared by The Irish Times (@irishtimesnews) Regular readers will know I am also a big fan of the Laurent Miquel wines from Dunnes Stores, including the Laurent Miquel Côte 128 Viognier and the Côte 128 Albariño, both bargains at €12. Dunnes also has the Guigal Côtes du Rhône Blanc (€15) a rich viognier-dominated white that would go well with fish and turkey. I also enjoyed its smooth spicy 409 Ribera del Duero (€15), possibly best with roast beef or goose. Light and zesty, the Tesco Finest Pecorino (€12/€9) would go nicely with shellfish starters, and so too would its crisp dry Tesco Finest Chablis (€26). For a red wine, the Alegro Rioja (€15/€10) offers good value at the Clubcard price, as does the Chapoutier Côtes du Rhône Villages (€15/€12). To finish off, the Tesco Finest Sauternes (€18/€17 per half-bottle) is rich and honeyed with apricots and barley sugar. [ Favourite picks from Dublin’s longstanding independent wine shopsOpens in new window ] From SuperValu, the Goichot Pouilly-Fuissé looks well-priced at €15. Fresh and lightly textured, it could be drunk throughout the dinner. I have covered the Vacqueyras Rémy Ferbras before; smooth and rounded it offers good value at €10 and would go nicely with chicken and red meats. Also on offer are two perennial favourites, the Goichot Fleurie (€10) and the Château Lacombe-Cadiot from Bordeaux (€12). Can any wine be worth €140? I am not sure, but if somebody else is paying, I would very happily drink the Meursault Genevrières Premier Cru Latour-Giraud 2023 (€139, Whelehan’s), a superb complex white Burgundy, textured, ripe and rich with a wonderful lingering finish. Floral with broad textured mouthwatering green fruits and a distinctive saline finish. This is one of my favourite white wines and a great choice for Christmas dinner. From O’Briens An instantly drinkable wine with very supple savoury ripe plums and light tannins. One of my red wines of the year. From Lilith, Dublin 7; Pinto, Dublin 9; Green Man Wines, Dublin 6; Lennox Street Grocer, Dublin 8; Grapevine, Dalkey, Co Dublin; 64 Wine, Glasthule, Co Dublin; MacCurtain Wine, Cork; Baggot Street Wines, Dublin 2; BaRossa, Sandymount, Dublin 4 A delicious pure chardonnay with concentrated pear and apple fruits, toasted hazelnuts and a lingering finish. From WineSpark.com Elegant smooth and sophisticated, with supple savoury dark cherries and blackcurrants, fine tannins and a long finish. Try it with turkey, beef or goose.

Title: Trump gives Elon Musk a win over a longtime foe | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks President Donald Trump on Thursday ordered a review of two major proxy advisory firms — companies that advise shareholders on votes — that had previously drawn the ire of Tesla CEO Elon Musk and others in Corporate America. The executive order singles out the two biggest players in the market: Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis. Proxy advisory firms like ISS and Glass Lewis provide recommendations on how major investors like pension funds should vote on corporate decisions and at shareholder meetings — sometimes to the consternation of other shareholders or even corporate executives. Trump’s executive order directs the Securities and Exchange Commission to review ISS and Glass Lewis specifically scrutinizing their use of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) and environmental, social and governance policies (ESG). “Even if no immediate rules change, boards, institutional investors and the firms themselves take notice,” Kerry Berchem, a partner at Akin and co-leader of the firm’s corporate governance and activism practice, told CNN. “This can influence behavior indirectly — firms may alter recommendations, increase transparency, or adjust methodologies to avoid conflict with regulators.” The order is a win for Musk, who has bemoaned ISS and Glass Lewis’ role in advising shareholders. The advisory firms have previously recommended that investors vote against corporate decisions at Tesla like giving Musk a larger pay package. Some on Wall Street have also previously voiced concern about proxy advisory firms’ sway over shareholders’ decisions. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has argued against the companies, calling them “incompetent.” Elon Musk said he needs $1 trillion to stop ‘corporate terrorists’ from wresting control of Tesla ISS and Glass Lewis “use their substantial power to advance and prioritize radical politically-motivated agendas,” including DEI and ESG, according to the order. These proxy advisory firms have offered research and advice that incorporates ESG investing, which has been slammed by many conservatives. Under pressure from the Trump administration, Corporate America has seen a broad shift away from DEI and ESG policies that were more widely embraced a few years ago. “President Trump and many Republican allies have made clear their concerns about ‘woke capitalism’ — the idea that corporations, investors, or advisors push political or social agendas (like ESG, DEI, climate policies) that he views as contrary to shareholder financial interests or traditional US economic priorities,” Berchem said. “President Trump’s move won’t immediately change proxy advice, but it signals scrutiny, assuredly rattles the industry and subtly shifts the power dynamic toward corporate boards,” she added. ISS, founded in 1985, and Glass Lewis, founded in 2003, advise major institutional investors like BlackRock, pension funds and a range of other asset managers. ISS and Glass Lewis are owned by companies in Germany and Canada, respectively. Institutional investors that manage up to trillions of dollars can invest in so many companies that, when it comes to annual shareholder meetings and votes, they need more insight on what to decide. Proxy advisory firms conduct research and advise on how to vote on decisions including, but not limited to, executive compensation, board structure, climate and environmental issues and potential mergers and acquisitions. “I question whether American corporate governance should be determined by for-profit international institutions that may have their own strong feelings about what constitutes good corporate governance,” Dimon wrote in his 2023 annual letter to shareholders. A spokesperson for ISS said in a statement that the company is aware of the executive order and will review it as it considers next steps: “ISS does not dictate or set corporate governance standards and remains firmly committed to operating professionally, ethically, independently, and in the best interests of our clients, as we have done historically.” A spokesperson for Glass Lewis said in a statement: “While we are still reviewing the full order, we appreciate the clarity it provides in understanding what the administration expects of all firms in the proxy advisory space. Glass Lewis has always operated with the highest ethical standards with our clients being at the center of everything we do.” Trump’s executive order highlights just how influential ISS and Glass Lewis have become, Lawrence Elbaum, an M&A partner at Sullivan & Cromwell and co-head of its shareholder activism defense practice, told CNN. “It’s on the heels of efforts by different states and other constituencies to try to curb ISS and Glass Lewis’ influence,” Elbaum said. “So I’m not surprised to see the executive order.” Attorneys from Sullivan & Cromwell are representing Trump in a New York criminal case. Elbaum is not affiliated with the legal defense. The proxy advisory firms have come under pressure in recent months. Florida’s attorney general, James Uthmeier, is suing ISS and Glass Lewis, alleging the companies are in violation of state antitrust laws. Trump’s executive order also directs the Federal Trade Commission to investigate whether ISS and Glass Lewis are in violation of antitrust laws. Still, Elbaum cautioned, until any government reviews are completed, it’s hard to know what exactly will happen to the advisory firms. “I would say this EO is an initial momentum toward a ‘win’ for Musk and Dimon, but ultimately we won’t know whether there’s been a ‘win’ until this plays out further as the government agencies do their work,” Elbaum said.

The comments followed the asset management company’s policy change allowing its clients to trade crypto exchange-traded funds. Bitcoin is a purely speculative asset and is akin to a collectible toy, according to John Ameriks, the global head of quantitative equity at asset management company Vanguard. “It’s difficult for me to think about Bitcoin as anything more than a digital Labubu,” Ameriks said at Bloomberg’s ETFs in Depth conference in New York City. Labubus are collectible plush toys featuring animals with anthropomorphic features. Despite Ameriks’ criticism, he said that Bitcoin (BTC) may have value beyond financial speculation in the future under certain circumstances. The cryptocurrency could find real-world use cases beyond market speculation in scenarios of high fiat currency inflation or political instability, Ameriks said. These forces drive the adoption of alternative currencies. The comments followed Vanguard’s announcement in December, allowing its clients to trade cryptocurrency funds for the first time, and highlight the doubts of analysts and executives in traditional finance about Bitcoin, even as its price hovers above $90,000, with 16 years of network uptime. Related: Bitcoin first, crypto at scale: Inside the UAE’s layered digital asset strategy Vanguard was the last of the three major asset management companies, which include BlackRock and State Street, to allow clients to hold crypto investment vehicles. “We allow people to hold and buy these ETFs on our platform if they wish to do so, but they do so with discretion,” Ameriks said, adding that Vanguard won’t offer investors “advice as to whether to buy or sell or which crypto tokens they ought to hold.” The policy change gives Vanguard’s over 50 million clients exposure to crypto markets and creates yet another bridge between traditional finance and digital assets, funneling money into crypto networks. The fresh capital injections from Vanguard’s clients could boost prices for cryptocurrencies tied to exchange-traded funds.

By WND Staff December 12, 2025 America is pushing its own workers out of the economy, and almost no one in power will say it out loud. James Fishback joins Elizabeth Farah days after launching his campaign for Florida governor to explain how visa programs, hedge funds, and AI expansion are dismantling jobs, homeownership, and family life. Fishback points to hard numbers and concrete policies. Only 15 percent of 30-year-old men now own a home. Corporations legally replace American graduates with H-1B visa labor. BlackRock and Blackstone outbid families for single-family homes and turn neighborhoods into rentals. Airbnb replaces neighbors with weekend tourists. AI data centers drive up electricity costs while threatening local water supplies. Elizabeth presses Fishback on what this actually looks like on the ground. Young Americans delay marriage because they cannot afford a home. Families lose bidding wars to hedge funds. College graduates train their foreign replacements. Communities hollow out as housing becomes a balance-sheet asset instead of a place to raise children. Get the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet – delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts! Fishback argues this did not happen by accident. Republicans and Democrats approved the visa programs, protected corporate buyers, and shifted the costs onto working families. He lays out why states do not have to accept this arrangement, and why Florida could become the first test case for blocking labor replacement, taxing corporate home hoarding, and stopping AI projects that raise utility bills. This is a blunt, unsanitized conversation about who the American economy now serves, who it leaves behind, and why restoring jobs, housing, and sovereignty may start at the state level.

Title: Pay Attention, Little Known VGK Has Nearly Doubled VOO and SPYs Returns This Year

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © NATO alliance flag on Europe map. North Atlantic Treaty Organization. High quality photo (Shutterstock.com) by Rokas Tenys Going into the final weeks of 2025, the S&P 500 has had another strong year. ETFs that track the S&P 500 have posted double-digit returns yet again for the year, with Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSE: VOO) coming in year-to-date at 18.43% and SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE: SPY) right behind at 18.34% at the time of this writing. Much of these gains can be credited to the multi-trillion net capital valuations that have swelled with Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, and other Magnificent 7 AI stocks that festoon the S&P 500’s top 10. However, there are many household name companies that are not a part of the S&P 500 top 10, mostly due to their lack of AI development. A good number of them aren’t even American. For example – Nestle (chocolate), AstroZeneca (pharma), and LVMH (luxury goods) are all European companies whose products have garnered widespread use, and their respective stock prices have risen accordingly. A notable point is that none of these companies’ gains are contingent upon any in-house AI development, but rather on intrinsic value of their respective products and sales. Nevertheless, they are essential in the market, and all three can be found in the top 10 list of another ETF: the Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF (NYSE: VGK). More intriguing is the fact that VGK currently sports a year-to-date return of 32.97%, which is 79% higher than VOO and only a few points shy of doubling its returns. The Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF contains over 1,200 stocks hailing from the Eurozone and Scandinavia. Issued by Vanguard, the second largest asset manager in the world after BlackRock, the Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF tracks the FTSE Developed Europe All Cap Index, which covers stocks from the Eurozone and Scandinavia. Passively managed, its inception dates back to 3-4-2005. An overview of VGK appears below: The top 10 holdings of VGK are: As one can see, unlike with VOO or SPY, in which 7 out of the top 10 are AI tech companies, the top 10 holdings of VGK contain a wider range of industrial sectors: pharma, technology, financial, and luxury goods. In fact, VGK’s sector concentration puts technology at #6, or 8.27%, behind: Michael “The Big Short” Burry is one of the higher profile critics of the perceived AI bubble, which has prompted the shift of many funds into VGK and other ETFs with solid growth upside without AI dependency. There are a number of reasons why VGK has been able to outperform VOO and SPY this year. It is admittedly an anomaly. Historically, it has usually lagged behind, sometimes by a substantial amount. However, 2025 contained certain events that helped to give VGK a big boost. A few of these include: Geopolitical Tariff Fears: In March, President Trump’s reciprocal tariff policy announcement caused a big drop in the S&P 500, since many believed the analysts and pundits that it would trigger massive inflation and supply chain issues. With WalMart and other US retailers relying on Chinese manufacturing for millions of their best-selling retail items, the concerns over a renewed trade war with China were understandably disconcerting. Europe, on the other hand, felt the impact much less severely. The initial trade conflicts largely were focused on China and India, so the comparative stability of European markets drew investors from all over the world who were seeking less volatility and unknown economic outcomes. Sector Preferences From Global Investors: The huge bull run on the AI focused Magnificent 7 stocks has created the first multi-trillion valuations of Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, et. al. This has also led to fears that the AI industry has become a bubble, not unlike that of the dotcoms. Michael “The Big Short” Burry is a vocal critic of the AI bubble and of Nvidia in particular, and his track record for shorting economic bubbles in the market warranted a movie about his successful prediction of the 2008 subprime mortgage banking meltdown, starring Christian Bale as Burry. VGK’s 44% weighting towards financials and industrials became appealing to many institutional investors this year who shared Burry’s fears. Strength In Numbers: While the S&P 500 represents 500 of the strongest market-weighted companies representing a cross-section of US economic and financial health, the Magnificent 7 stocks are responsible for over half of the 18% gain YTD, making it a “live by the sword, die by the sword scenario”. By contrast, VGK’s index, the FTSE Developed Europe All Cap Index, encompasses over 1,200 different stocks across multiple countries. Given the lower level of sector competition in each European and Scandinavian nation, each has its own territorial near-monopolies in various sectors, cumulatively making for multiple big winners all contributing to the overall index strength. As 2025 comes to a close, the S&P 500 is still not showing any signs of faltering, but Europe should be able to maintain at least some of its lead, provided it does not succumb to foolish policies or geopolitical in-fighting among EU members, such as Brussels’ attempts to compel Italy to accede to its migrant policy, which Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is staunchly resisting.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Butus / Shutterstock.com Vanguard—one of the world’s largest asset managers—shocked the financial industry by reversing its long-held anti-crypto stance. The firm, which oversees $11 trillion in client assets, now allows Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and cryptocurrency ETFs on its brokerage platform starting December 2, 2025. This policy shift opens access for Vanguard’s 50 million clients (many of them conservative investors) to finally buy regulated crypto investment products. The move validates crypto’s place in mainstream finance and raises a critical question: could this influx of potential capital help drive Bitcoin’s price back to the $100,000 mark? Vintage Tone / Shutterstock.com For years, Vanguard stood out as a major holdout even as other financial giants embraced digital assets. When the first U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs launched in January 2024 after lengthy SEC battles, Vanguard actively blocked its customers from buying those funds. So what changed by late 2025? Vanguard’s reversal came from shifts both inside and outside the company—new leadership played a key role. In July 2024, Vanguard appointed Salim Ramji as CEO, the first outsider to head the firm. Ramji came from BlackRock’s iShares division, where he helped launch that firm’s Bitcoin ETF, bringing a much more crypto-friendly perspective. Externally, regulations around crypto developed significantly. Under a more innovation-friendly administration, the SEC eased its stance and approved multiple spot crypto ETFs. Competitors like Fidelity, Charles Schwab, and traditional banks moved ahead with crypto offerings, creating competitive pressure Vanguard couldn’t ignore. Studies found many younger, wealthy clients were leaving advisors who couldn’t offer crypto options, highlighting a growing business risk. Faced with these realities, Vanguard capitulated. The firm still won’t launch its own crypto funds, sticking to its core indexing philosophy. However, it now serves as a gateway for clients to buy crypto ETFs from other issuers like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Bitwise. The sheer scale of Vanguard’s $11 trillion clientele means the impact won’t arrive as a one-time tsunami, but as persistent demand. Fifty million new potential investors with trillions in assets don’t create overnight pumps—they create steady, persistent demand that supports multi-year bull markets. DUSAN ZIDAR / Shutterstock.com The immediate market reaction to Vanguard’s crypto reversal was emphatic. Bitcoin’s price jumped roughly 6% in a single day when the news hit, briefly breaching $93,000 before settling around $91,000. Within minutes of the U.S. market opening on December 2, a wave of buying pressure sparked a sharp rally, catching many traders off guard. The surge liquidated an estimated $400 million worth of short positions—bets that Bitcoin’s price would fall—in 24 hours, as pessimistic traders scrambled to cover. One analyst noted the “violent move from $88,000 to $93,000 happened so fast because the market had loaded up on shorts” that got squeezed. Options markets saw heavy activity too, with large call options accumulating around the $95,000 to $100,000 strikes. That’s a sign some big players are positioning for Bitcoin approaching the $100K threshold soon. DUSAN ZIDAR / Shutterstock.com Many crypto analysts are bullish about what Vanguard’s entry means for Bitcoin. They point out that Bitcoin’s supply is fixed at 21 million coins, with over 19.6 million already mined. Any influx of new buyers can have an outsized effect on price given the scarce supply. With tens of millions of new investors now gaining easy access through a trusted platform, the pool of potential Bitcoin demand has expanded dramatically. Each major wave of institutional adoption in the past has coincided with a leap in Bitcoin’s valuation. The late 2017 boom was fueled by retail and initial coin offerings. The 2020-2021 cycle saw Bitcoin soar to $69,000 amid retail frenzy and corporate treasury buys. The 2024-2025 cycle, after ETF approvals, sent Bitcoin to new highs around $126,000 in October 2025. Bulls argue that Vanguard’s embrace could mark the next leg of Bitcoin’s maturation, potentially driving it to six-figure prices on sustained institutional buying. Some optimistic projections suggest Bitcoin could climb to $150,000-$200,000 by the end of 2026 if mainstream adoption continues at this pace, meaning $100K might be just a stepping stone. Vanguard’s entry has sparked a new wave of bullish Bitcoin predictions. Here are three possible predictions for the BTC price heading into 2026. In an optimistic scenario, Bitcoin enters 2026 with strong momentum as Vanguard clients allocate even modest percentages to crypto. If just 1% of Vanguard’s $11 trillion flows into Bitcoin ETFs over the next year, that’s $110 billion in new capital. Combined with continued institutional demand and regulatory clarity, Bitcoin could push past $100,000 and test $120,000-$150,000 by late 2026. Outside Vanguard’s influence, other catalysts support this case. U.S. regulators approved the first spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, opening crypto to mainstream funds. ETFs have gathered roughly $121 billion in assets by December 2025. Assuming continued strong ETF inflows (several billion per quarter) and no major macro shocks, Bitcoin would likely follow a grinding uptrend toward new all-time highs. In a moderate scenario, Bitcoin’s price rises steadily but without parabolic gains. Vanguard’s customers remain conservative and allocate slowly. Initial allocation rates might be around 0.1% to 0.2% of eligible Vanguard assets flowing into crypto early on, translating to just a few billion dollars spread across various crypto ETFs over the first year. That alone won’t catapult Bitcoin’s price to six figures overnight. The base case portrays Bitcoin making modest gains into 2026, aided by steady investment from Vanguard investors, institutional flows, and clearer U.S. regulation, but without the hyper-enthusiasm or panic of extreme cases. Bitcoin trades in a $90,000-$110,000 range for much of 2026, with occasional tests of $115,000-$120,000 during bullish periods. Cautious analysts urge a more tempered outlook if things don’t go according to plan. Critics point out that Vanguard is late to the party—their clients missed out on huge gains from 2023 to 2025 while the firm dragged its feet, and those big early opportunities won’t simply repeat on command. Additionally, macroeconomic headwinds could dampen enthusiasm. If the Federal Reserve holds rates higher for longer or if recession fears intensify, risk assets like Bitcoin could suffer. The timing of Vanguard’s reversal also matters. Bitcoin already rallied from $15,000 in late 2022 to over $126,000 in October 2025—much of the institutional adoption story might already be priced in. In a bearish scenario, Bitcoin could consolidate in the $70,000-$85,000 range through 2026, with brief spikes to $95,000 followed by pullbacks. The $100,000 milestone would remain elusive as profit-taking and cautious macro sentiment cap gains. Our top personal finance-related articles today. Your wallet will thank you later.

Source: Bloomberg. We’ve gone from a moneyproxy war to a privatized reconstruction racket, and now to global asset managers and Trump’s inner-circle real-estate cronies literally inserting themselves into diplomatic negotiations over a live war zone. BlackRock has already positioned itself to manage Ukraine’s postwar “rebuilding” aka a $400+ billion fire-sale of national assets. Now Fink is reportedly sitting at the table with Twink Kushner and Real Estate Agent Witkoff, because to them Ukraine’s fate is a business venture, not a sovereign crisis. Are you getting it yet?

The only losers here are your average Ukrainians who want their own national identity and culture separate from the filth of Russkiy Mir. In the end nobody cares about them just as the open borders crowd couldn’t care less about the average American. “WTH is that Fink doing involved?” That’s why we paid those billions so Larry could have a fire sale. this all has a bad optic about it, sorry to have to say bears watching Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-26 next last Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

A meteor shower is expected to light up Irish skies tonight, with around 20 times more shooting stars than normal. The geminid meteor shower is set to reach its peak activity tomorrow night and into Sunday morning. However, Blackrock Castle Observatory centre manager Alan Giltinan said tonight will be the best night to catch sight of a shooting star due to a poor weather outlook across the weekend. He said that there could be up to 10-15 shooting stars per hour, but up to 100-120 per hour is possible. From 10pm onwards tomorrow night, stargazers should look to the east to try catch sight of the dazzling display.

Title: BeToken Transforms an 18-Year Business Into a Web3 Asset

December 12, 2025 10:14 ET | Source: BeToken BeToken BARCELONA, Spain, Dec. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- In a market saturated with speculative crypto launches and short-lived experiments, a new European project is taking a fundamentally different path. BeToken, built on the operational backbone of Beself Brands, is introducing a model where tokenisation is no longer a promise for the future but a real extension of a business that has been running successfully for nearly two decades. The initiative marks a significant shift: tokenisation is finally stepping into the real economy. $BTK is Designed Around a Profitable Business Unlike most blockchain projects that begin with an idea and hope to build traction later, BeToken starts from a position of strength. Beself Brands, the company behind the token, was founded in 2007 and today operates a network of retail and ecommerce brands that reach hundreds of thousands of customers across Europe. Over the years, the group has built multi-million dollar revenues, strong customer loyalty, and the infrastructure needed to scale efficiently. This foundation is what makes BeToken different. It is not attempting to create value from scratch. Instead, it is opening access to value already proven in the market. For media and investors, this represents a rare case where a token is not detached from real-world performance but directly linked to a functioning, profitable business. Portfolio of Leading Consumer Brands The tokenisation initiative is anchored in a broad ecosystem of more than 1,000 products and several household-name brands in their categories. Beself Brands operates FITFIU Fitness, Greencut, Mc Haus, Beeloom, and Playkin, all of which have grown steadily through operational excellence, efficient logistics, and a clear understanding of European consumer demand. Tokenising part of this business is not just innovative, it positions BeToken among the first European retail ecommerce groups to take such a step. It signals a turning point: tokenisation is no longer reserved for financial instruments or theoretical real-world assets, but can be applied to real commerce with established supply chains and strong margins. As Mireia Calvet Verges, CEO of BeToken, said: "BeToken marks the beginning of a new era for Beself Brands: we are moving from being a consolidated, profitable European company with more than €20M in annual revenue to becoming a vehicle for exponential global growth. Our challenge is not demand — we already have it. What limits our acceleration is capital. We have strong brands, operations in 10 countries, and a clear plan to multiply our presence in key markets like France, Italy, and Germany. Tokenization allows us to break the barriers of traditional equity, bringing real liquidity and opening our expansion to a global investor base under a regulated, transparent, and efficient model. BeToken is not an experiment; it is the natural evolution of how modern companies should finance growth. With this initiative, we accelerate a business plan that will take us beyond €95M in sales within the next six years and drive sustained value appreciation across all our brands. Today, we are opening access to a tangible opportunity: becoming part of the future of Beself Brands." Access to High-Performing Companies One of the biggest barriers to investing in successful private companies has always been exclusivity. Access is typically limited to venture funds, private equity firms, or ultra-wealthy individuals. BeToken aims to change this dynamic by allowing anyone to participate in the company’s growth with a starting investment of €2,000. To make the entry experience even more appealing, the platform introduces tiered bonuses from 5% to 15% depending on the chosen investment pack. While simple in structure, this approach reflects a broader mission: to redefine how everyday investors can access and benefit from the growth of real businesses. Clarity and Transparency in Web3 Fundraising Clarity has become one of the strongest differentiators of the project. The BeToken platform prominently displays the official token price of €2.75, the effective price after bonuses, and the remaining availability in each tier. This level of transparency, although standard in traditional finance, is still uncommon in Web3 launches, where pricing often feels ambiguous or intentionally complex. For investors, this becomes a signal of maturity. For the broader market, it demonstrates that tokenisation can be executed with the same discipline and professionalism expected in established financial environments. Profit-Sharing Model At the core of the token’s design is alignment. BeToken holders participate proportionally in the performance of the entire group, gaining access to opportunities, exclusive benefits, and long-term upside that grows together with the company. This positions BeToken as part of a growing movement that sees tokens not simply as tradable digital assets but as vehicles for sharing the value generated by productive, real-world companies. It reflects what many analysts believe to be the future of retail investment, a bridge between traditional business performance and new digital ownership models. Built Under Regulatory Principles With MiCA shaping the future of digital assets in Europe, regulatory clarity has become a critical competitive advantage. From the outset, BeToken has prioritised compliance, transparency, and public documentation. The project follows a European approach to token structure, offering a contrast to many international launches that still operate without clear oversight. This alignment with evolving regulation not only increases investor confidence but also signals that tokenisation in Europe may develop differently, with stronger emphasis on protection, clarity, and long-term sustainability. A Scalable Model for RWA Movement What sets BeToken apart is not only what it represents today but what it could unlock tomorrow. The structure developed by Beself Brands is designed to be replicable, offering a blueprint for thousands of SMEs and mid-sized businesses looking for new ways to attract capital, engage their community, and modernise their financial operations. As Europe continues searching for a Web3 model rooted in tangible economic activity, BeToken is one of the first real cases capable of guiding the next wave of adoption. Limited Availability The launch introduces controlled scarcity by limiting the number of packs in each investment tier. With only 50, 40, 20, and 10 allocations available across the four levels, investors have a clear incentive to act early. For media outlets, this creates a timely narrative: this is not an open-ended raise, but a structured opportunity that reflects real business discipline. Global Tokenisation Trend BeToken enters the market at a moment when tokenisation is gaining global recognition. Boston Consulting Group estimates the tokenised asset market could reach $16 trillion by 2030, while BlackRock refers to it as “the next great financial revolution.” In this context, BeToken becomes more than a company initiative. It stands as a European example of how real-world businesses can meaningfully adopt Web3 technology. Team With Deep Experience Behind the token is Beself Brands’ 18-year track record, built by a team of more than 60 professionals across logistics, operations, technology, and e-commerce. Their experience allows the project to merge traditional business excellence with modern digital infrastructure, a combination rarely seen in the current tokenisation landscape. About BeToken BeToken is a European tokenisation project built on Beself Brands, a consolidated retail and e-commerce group founded in 2007. Through a transparent, regulation-aligned model, BeToken allows investors to participate in the performance of an established multi-brand business. The project aims to set a new standard for real-world tokenisation in Europe. About Beself Brands Beself Brands operates some of Europe’s leading consumer brands, including FITFIU Fitness, Greencut, Mc Haus, Beeloom, and Playkin. With 18 years of operation, multi-million annual revenues, and strong logistics capacity, the group now brings its track record into the Web3 space through BeToken.

Title: Scaramucci predicts ‘exponential opportunity’ for crypto at LONGITUDE

Time Published: 2025-12-12T13:34:47Z

The cryptocurrency industry is riding on the tailwinds of regulatory clarity and newfound interest from institutional investors into the new year. Institutional investment and clear-cut regulations are laying the foundation for a strong start to 2026 for the wider cryptocurrency industry. Industry players including Anthony Scaramucci, Kristin Smith, Eli Ben-Sasson, Ian Rodgers, Reeve Collins and Joseph Chalom delivered optimistic outlooks for the new year after a year of positive change, particularly in the United States. Cointelegraph’s latest LONGITUDE event featured panels focused on Solana’s growth, surging interest in privacy protocols and lessons learned from security incidents in 2025. “There’s been a tremendous amount of progress in 2025, an unprecedented amount,” Smith said. The president of the Solana Policy Institute has been intimately involved in crypto-focused discussions in Washington over the past 18 months. Scaramucci said educating policymakers remains a key hurdle to helping the traditional financial system adopt innovative protocols running on blockchain rails. “Kristin has got to go into those rooms, and she’s got to explain to these people why this regulation needs to get passed so that we can retool the financial system and make the system less expensive and more seamless,” Scaramucci said. The founder of SkyBridge Capital added that existing TradFi systems currently spend over $4 trillion on transaction verification globally. Shifting to protocols like Ethereum and Solana, which currently rank highest for RWA tokenization and onchain activity, could offer unrivalled efficiency and cost savings. Again, the major hurdle in recent years has been lagging regulations that have scuppered innovation and the ability for institutions to actively explore using blockchain protocols. “We can do that today. It’s actually fairly easy to issue a share or a bond on a blockchain. The problem is the regulations don’t make sense when it comes to trading those assets. And so that’s a piece that we’re working on,” Smith said. Related: Scaramucci family invested over $100M in Trump’s Bitcoin mining firm: Report Scaramucci delivered a bullish parting message, highlighting the intent of America’s biggest financial institutions, BlackRock, Blackstone and JPMorgan, moving to tokenize assets on blockchain protocols. StarkWare founder Eli Ben-Sasson, who also co-founded the Zcash protocol, engaged in a thought-provoking fireside chat unpacking why privacy protocols have been in vogue in the latter half of 2025. Ben-Sasson weighed in on the massive interest in Zcash (ZEC) in 2025. The privacy-focused cryptocurrency has been around since 2016, but saw a massive surge in value and interest off the back of support from various big names in the industry. “At one extreme, you have the stuff we did at Zcash, which is resistance money level of privacy. If you need to jump on a plane and the government is pursuing you and you need to be fully, you know, off the radar, then you have that,” Ben-Sasson said. However, Ben-Sasson said the cost of that luxury is in the user experience. Wallets, programmability and user experience are harder to provide with that level of privacy. The less technical end of the spectrum affords a use case that is in high demand. Related: Can Zcash’s rise revive the Bitcoin OP_CAT discussion? “Enterprises come in, and they are going to want a different kind of privacy and also a different kind of privacy from the kind that we did on Zcash. They’re going to want privacy where they, as enterprises, and their customers are shielded away from other customers and from their competitors,” he said. Security was another major talking point at LONGITUDE VII, given the spate of high-profile hacks and security incidents in 2025. The theft of $1.6 billion of Ether (ETH) from Bybit in March was a wake-up call for the industry. As Phemex CEO Federico Variola explained, social engineering and unverified access continue to be a major threat to everyday crypto users. “It’s difficult in crypto because sometimes you need to participate in an airdrop, or like you want your Twitter account to be linked to the MegaETH ICO, for example. Nevertheless, you should be aware that you’re always exposing yourself to significant risk,” Variola said. Related: Bybit hack: ‘Reckoning’ that led SafeWallet to rearchitect its systems Ledger’s chief experience officer Ian Rodgers said that the onus is on service providers and infrastructure builders to think critically about the risks their platforms and users face. “There is no way to make a risk go to zero. But it is the responsibility to minimize the risk as much as possible, to think about what is the worst thing that could possibly happen, what could go wrong here,” Rodgers said.

Title: ETFs May Be Blurring the Line Between Gambling and Investing

Wanna bet? ETFs aren’t for gambling, but a rise in risk-on products could prove irresistible to a population obsessed with sports betting. Emile Hallez emile@thedailyupside.com To paraphrase a variety of sayings about making money in risky endeavors, the easiest way to get to $1 million is to start with $2 million. Historically, gambling and investing have been handled differently by the average American. The latter, of course, is intended to build wealth over time. But as access to gambling has dramatically expanded in recent years in the US, with sports betting and prediction markets available on anyone’s smartphone, the behaviors and attitudes around it have arguably bled into the investing world. There is now a booming new menu of exchange-traded products that let investors take risky, short-term stances, and that development in the ETF industry has some observers sounding the alarm. “There really are few parallels between investing and gambling, but there are many close parallels between speculation and gambling,” said Robert Johnson, professor of finance at Creighton University’s Heider College of Business. “And, unfortunately, the line between speculation and gambling is not only getting blurred, but it is being eliminated.” There are examples in the investing world that resemble speculation or gambling, Johnson said. Those include crypto assets, picking stocks in the electric vehicles market and leveraged ETFs (which in some cases overlap with crypto and EV stocks). “There is no way to value cryptocurrencies other than the greater fool theory — the hope that some greater fool will pay you more than you paid,” he said. “It is the consummate bubble, and investors should stay far away from cryptocurrencies in general and bitcoin specifically.” A growing number of asset managers might disagree with that. It’s now common for traditional financial companies to offer access to them. And some firms even recommend small allocations to bitcoin for wealth management clients. The latest company to cave to the crypto craze, Vanguard, allows brokerage clients to buy bitcoin and other crypto ETFs, but it doesn’t include memecoins. It’s also notable that Vanguard doesn’t include leveraged or inverse ETFs on its brokerage platform. Broad market index ETFs are appropriate for most investors, Johnson said. Leveraged ETFs, though, which amplify gains and losses and often reset daily, are not, he noted. Those products are increasing in number and size: Robinhood and other brokerage systems have helped trading skyrocket in popularity, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic, when many people were trapped indoors and had an abundance of time on their hands. While stockpicking can be inherently risky, the stakes have been pushed higher with the availability of prediction markets, or yes/no derivative contracts for the outcome of almost any event imaginable. It’s also big business: Still, there are differences in the kinds of information people have and how they use it that can distinguish between gambling and investing, said Valeria Martinez, CEO of Bettingladies.com, an online community of women who bet on sports. “Investors rely on fundamentals and disclosures, while bettors rely on performance data, models and market sentiment,” she said. “Perhaps where the two overlap is in the mindset. People today are simply more used to making probabilistic decisions in all areas of life, whether it’s choosing a stock or picking a team.” A former CFTC enforcement attorney who now defends white-collar clients said risky behaviors that start while gambling can snowball into investing, and at great costs. “Investors who slip into speculative, emotion-driven behavior become far more vulnerable to fraud, market manipulation schemes and high-pressure sales tactics,” said Braden Perry, partner at Kennyhertz Perry. “The behavior that begins as entertainment trading can develop into misuse of margin, unauthorized trading or increasingly desperate attempts to recover losses. Those situations often lead to regulatory investigations or even criminal exposure.” What Could Go Wrong? Even for stocks with net positive returns, leveraged ETFs held for longer than a day can underperform those target stocks because of decay, caused by their daily resets, amplified losses during volatility and fees. But big losses can also happen quickly, as seen during 2020’s extreme volatility, when inverse VIX exchange-traded notes lost nearly all their value and closed, Creighton University’s Johnson said. A more recent example is UK-domiciled GraniteShares 3X Short AMD ETP, which erased its value in a single day in October after Advanced Micro Devices’s stock jumped 38%. “In the hands of amateur investors, leveraged ETFs and ETNs are weapons of mass wealth destruction,” Johnson said. What’s most worrisome to Aaron Randak, founder of Golden Acre Wealth Management, is the great wealth transfer, in which younger generations stand to inherit tens of trillions of dollars from baby boomers. The success stories of a few people in prediction markets might be what younger people most often see, rather than the risks. And that could potentially impact investing behavior down the road. “It could be an overall positive for the world to have these prediction markets, because it shines a light on the major events,” he said. When it comes to investing, leveraged ETFs can be very useful for highly experienced traders and institutional investors, but “the younger investor doesn’t have any clue what research is needed.” The company is planning to add 10 target-maturity ETFs. Vanguard and State Street have also moved to fill out their bond-ladder lines. With more than $1.4 trillion in flows and more than 1,000 product launches, it’s safe to say the industry is booming. A new proposed ETF would hold bitcoin only after markets close. After a dive, the company’s stock is still up 8% in 2025, while both long and short leveraged ETFs are down. The world’s largest asset manager and issuer of the biggest crypto ETF is expanding into staked Ethereum. Is there room for anyone else? Active fixed-income strategies accounted for nearly half of ETF inflows so far this year. Niche strategies, like buffer ETFs, could play a larger role in deal activity. Its price is up 100%, significantly ahead of gold’s surge, and the (very) few silver ETFs on the US market have benefited. The company’s flagship ETF, QQQ, is just shy of enough votes to approve its reclassification as an open-end fund. Recent developments at Vanguard and Bank of America have boosted momentum for digital assets including bitcoin ETFs. The company on Tuesday reversed its ban on Bitcoin and other crypto ETFs, giving access to many of its 50 million clients. The rise of model portfolios has enabled issuers to choose funds in their best interest — not necessarily the client’s. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: U.S. SEC Gives Implicit Nod for Tokenized Stocks

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) implicitly granted approval for some stocks and other securities to be tokenized and traded on blockchains. The Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. (DTCC), the world's largest securities settlement system, said on Thursday that a subsidiary, the Depository Trust Co. (DTC), received a no-action letter allowing it to offer a tokenization service on approved blockchains for three years. Tokenization is the process of representing stocks, bonds and other real-world assets (RWAs) as digital tokens that can be bought, sold and traded on blockchains, with the aim of achieving greater efficiency and faster settlement. Some of the biggest names in traditional finance (TradFi), including JPMorgan and BlackRock, have developed projects in this area, demonstrating the potential institutional investment that they can draw to blockchain finance. The Depository Trust Co.'s authorization applies to the constituents of the Russell 1000 index, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tracking major indexes and U.S. Treasuries. It plans to begin rolling out the service in the first half of 2026. A no-action letter is a formal response from the agency to a company stating that the regulator will not take any enforcement action for a proposed activity.

The big picture: It's the first time during Trump's second term that the House has secured enough votes to repeal one of his executive orders, though the measure faces an uphill battle as it heads to the GOP-controlled Senate. Federal employee unions have been at the forefront of the administration's efforts to shrink the federal workforce — moves that laid off more than 200,000 federal employees earlier this year and an approximate 4,000 during the nation's longest-ever government shutdown. The administration has argued that restricting union rights is necessary to protect national security, despite many agencies being indirectly linked to those concerns. Driving the news: The House voted 231-195 against Trump's March order, which sought to strip the employees' protections to negotiate for better pay, benefits and fair treatment. Rep. Jared Golden (D-Maine) and Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.) introduced the Protect America's Workforce Act, which they say would restore union rights for nearly 1 million federal workers.

URL: https://nypost.com/2025/12/11/business/jared-kushner-eyes-apollo-kkr-to-join-ukraines-postwar-reconstruction-fund-sources/
Time Published: 2025-12-12T03:18:42Z
Full Content:
Donald Trump’s Ukraine envoy, Jared Kushner, has approached Marc Rowan’s Apollo Global Management and Henry Kravis’s KKR to assist with post-war reconstruction in Ukraine, The Post has learned. Sources familiar with the matter said Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law who has no formal role in the administration, was in New York City on Wednesday for exploratory discussions with the top asset managers in Manhattan’s swanky Hudson Yards development. Insiders said the 44-year-old held meetings at the offices of both financial giants on how to rebuild the war-torn nation. The talks, which are still at a very early stage and may not come to fruition, came on the same day that he took part in a call with Larry Fink of BlackRock, the world’s biggest money manager, Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, as well as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The names of the VIP participants were released in a statement by Ukraine’s presidential office that evening. Reps for BlackRock, KKR, Affinity Partners, the Treasury Department, and President Zelensky did not return The Post’s requests for comment. A spokesman for Apollo declined to comment. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink halted his firm’s own multi-billion-dollar Ukraine Development Fund in July amid uncertainty over how President Trump would try to end the war. But he is set to revive the idea, which would also include involvement from the World Bank, that aimed to drum up some $400 billion in fresh investment. “This is not a huge money maker for whoever does it. They are not going to charge incentive fees. It’s a public service,” one person briefed on the situation added. “But you are going to ingratiate yourself with the president and Mr Kushner,” the source added. “They are going to f–k the Europeans.” Indeed, the move could raise fears amongst Ukraine’s allies in Europe that they will be cut out of any lucrative contracts to rebuild the war-torn country. The Trump administration, via the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), in September pledged $75 million in equity intended to jumpstart the fund’s investment in critical minerals, hydrocarbons, defense, and related infrastructure in Ukraine. That investment is set to be matched by Kyiv to bring it to an initial combined total of $150 million, but DFC stressed that much of the work would be done by “aligned private sector partners.” Ukrainian government officials, including Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko, are set to hold what one source described as “marathon talks” about the US-backed peace proposal this weekend. They will also focus on how to rebuild the nation that has been subjected to a brutal four-year attempt to wipe Ukraine off the map by Russian invaders. Kushner, who is not formally part of the administration, has emerged as a central figure in the process of negotiating a peace settlement between Ukraine and Russia. Alongside Trump envoy Steve Witkoff, he attended five hours of Kremlin talks last week with Russian President Vladimir Putin and then later discussions with a Ukrainian delegation in Florida. Kushner, married to the president’s daughter, Ivanka Trump, previously played a major role in negotiating a ceasefire agreement in Gaza between Israel and Hamas and has also put forward proposals for reconstruction in Gaza. A key point in plans for the reconstruction of Ukraine has been the establishment of an investment fund for sectors including rare metals – sought by the United States, with Svyrydenko playing a key role in setting it up. Kyiv sent its own revised draft of the now 20-point plan to the White House on Wednesday, according to German Chancellor Friedrich Merz.

A wide range of foreign and domestic investors were allotted shares, including the government of Singapore, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Fidelity, Norges Bank, BlackRock, Aberdeen, Wellington, Capital World, J P Morgan Investment Management Inc., Goldman Sachs and Aranda Investments Pte. Limited, according to a circular uploaded on the Bombay Stock Exchange's (BSE) website. Domestically, the anchor book also saw participation from the state-owned LIC and top mutual fund houses, such as SBI MF, Nippon India MF, Axis MF, HDFC MF and Aditya Birla Sun Life MF, among others. According to the circular, ICICI Prudential AMC has allotted 1.39 crore shares to 149 funds at ₹2,165 apiece, which is also the higher end of the price band. This anchor allocation comes on the heels of a pre-IPO (initial public offering) funding round, where 26 domestic and foreign investors infused ₹4,815 crore into ICICI Prudential AMC. As part of this transaction, the asset management company undertook a private placement of 2,22,40,841 equity shares at an issue price of ₹2,165 apiece, according to its public announcement on Wednesday. This substantial fundraise drew participation from a diverse set of investors, including Lunate Capital, the Estate of late Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, IIFL Asset Management, 360 One Funds, Whiteoak Capital, HCL Capital, and market veterans Manish Chokani and Madhusudan Kela. Alongside external investors, the ICICI Bank itself invested ₹2,140 crore to acquire an additional 2 per cent stake in the asset management company. With the anchor round completed, the company is now gearing up for its ₹10,602-crore maiden public offering, which will open on December 12 and close on December 16. ICICI Prudential AMC has set a price band of ₹2,061 to ₹2,165 per share for the issue, valuing the company at about ₹1.07 lakh crore ($11.86 billion). The IPO will be an entirely offer-for-sale (OFS) of more than 4.89 crore shares by its promoter, UK-based Prudential Corporation Holdings, meaning the company will not receive any proceeds from the offering. Currently, the ICICI Bank holds 51 per cent in the AMC, while Prudential owns the remaining 49 per cent. Once listed, ICICI Prudential AMC will become the latest asset manager to debut on Indian stock exchanges, joining players such as HDFC AMC, UTI AMC, Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC, Shriram AMC and Nippon Life India Asset Management. It will also be the fifth ICICI Group entity to be listed, after ICICI Bank, ICICI Prudential Life, ICICI Lombard and ICICI Securities. The company is scheduled to make its stock market debut on December 19. Published on December 12, 2025 Copyright© 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies. All rights reserved.

Title: Dogecoin Could Stage A 600% Rally In 2026 If This Multi-Year Support Holds

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. As the start-of-week momentum slows, Dogecoin (DOGE) dropped 5.5% on the daily timeframe, falling to the recent lows once again. Some analysts have suggested that the cryptocurrency is setting the stage for a massive short-term and mid-term rally if the retests of current levels hold. On Thursday, Dogecoin followed the rest of the crypto market and retraced to the $0.136-$0.138 levels. The cryptocurrency has retraced around 50% following the Q4 market downturn, trading within the $0.130-$0.155 price range over the past few weeks. Amid this week’s recovery, DOGE’s price briefly tested the local range highs, trying to break out of this area for the second time this month. However, Wednesday’s volatility, driven by the expectations of the Federal Reserve’s rate cut announcement, led to a 4.6% intraday drop before continuing its descent to the current levels. Market observer Trader Tardigrade highlighted the cryptocurrency’s performance, noting that Dogecoin is holding strong at a key support area despite the pullback, which could “potentially set the stage for a massive surge to $1” next year. According to the chart, DOGE is retesting an ascending support zone that has preceded major moves over the past two years. Since late 2023, this support has been retested three times, marking the bottom of each major corrective phase and serving as a “launchpad” to new highs. Notably, the subsequent rally’s size and duration have seen an increasing trend, with the bounces lasting longer and reaching higher levels after each retest of the two-year trendline. During the first rebound, Dogecoin rallied 87% in eight weeks. Meanwhile, DOGE surged by over 210% in ten weeks after retesting this crucial level. Lastly, it registered a 14-week 442% run between Q3 and Q4, 2024, to its multi-year high of $0.48. With the price currently retesting this level once again, the analyst suggested that a rally to the $1 mark could be brewing if the current levels hold. A bounce from this area could kick off a 610% jump at the start of 2026. The trader also pointed out that DOGE’s MACD Bullish Crossover “is now happening.” He explained that the cryptocurrency’s trend began shifting from a downtrend to an uptrend on Wednesday, suggesting a significant price move is to follow. He previously affirmed that this setup has preceded previous breakouts this year, with the price surging to new local highs in Q2 and Q3 after each MACD bullish cross. As this setup begins to unfold, the analyst’s chart suggests that the price could bounce to the October levels. Similarly, other market observers hinted that Dogecoin could be preparing for a 60%-120% surge in the short term. Analyst Bitcoinsensus highlighted a classic bullish reversal pattern, a falling wedge pattern, that has been forming since October in DOGE’s chart. After the recent price action, the “price has been slowly bleeding inside this structure and now potentially forming a nice rounded bottom. If we get a decent breakout above the upper yellow line, we could be targeting the 0.20$ area (+60%),” the analyst stated. Meanwhile, AltCryptoTalk recently noted that Dogecoin is retesting “the same weekly demand zone that sparked every major rally in the past,” which could spark a 115% rally to the $0.30 September high if the area holds. As of this writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.137, an 8% decline in the weekly timeframe. Rubmar is a writer and translator who has been a crypto enthusiast for the past four years.

In 2019, she first dipped her toes in the crypto industry when a friend introduced her to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, but it wasn’t until 2020 that she started to dive into the depth of the industry. As Rubmar began to understand the mechanics of the crypto sphere, she saw a new world yet to be explored. At the beginning of her crypto voyage, she discovered a new system that allowed her to have control over her finances. As a young adult of the 21st century, Rubmar has faced the challenges of the traditional banking system and the restrictions of fiat money. After the failure of her home country’s economy, the limitations of traditional finances became clear. The bureaucratic, outdated structure made her feel hopeless and powerless amid an aggressive and distorted system created by hyperinflation. However, learning about decentralization and self-custody opened a realm of opportunities. Cryptocurrencies allowed her to experience financial control for the first time and expand her financial education. Moreover, the peculiar nature of the crypto community sparked Rubmar’s curiosity about the other layers of the industry. As a result, she found a particular interest in discovering the diverse perspectives of investors, market watchers, experts, and developers. Her attempts to better understand the crypto space made her realize the strong links of the community with other industries, enriching her perspective of the sector. As someone who spends most of her day online, Rubmar enjoys finding the points where the crypto world meets with her other passions and hobbies ­–or her favorite memes. In her free time, she usually finds joy in different art forms. As a child, she enlisted in every extra-curricular activity in her hometown, including music classes, dancing, jewelry making, and the local chorus. Despite her many attempts to learn different instruments, Rubmar only knows how to play the xylophone, which she played for 7 years in her school’s marching band. She also has a passion for learning new languages and cultures, having set the goal to learn another six languages ­– currently attempting to learn Italian and Korean. Scrapbooking, paper crafting, and bookbinding are her biggest interests outside of work, constantly taking classes and attending workshops to learn new techniques. The rest of her free time is spent stressing over football matches and transfer market news or feeding cats –hers or stray. In summary, Rubmar seeks to present entertaining and educational pieces to be enjoyed by everybody, aiming to report on the latest news and offer a unique perspective while adding a meme or a pun whenever possible.
