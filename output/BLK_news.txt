Title: XRP’s Market Cap Beats Out Heavy Hitters In Climb Into 100 Top Global Assets — Here Are The Numbers

XRP has climbed back into the top 100 global assets by market cap, surpassing some notable names, following its reclaim of the psychological $3 level. This comes amid a broader crypto market rally, which has sparked hopes of a continuation of the bull run. Companies Market Cap data shows that XRP’s market cap is larger than that of the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, and also Sony. The altcoin’s market cap is currently at around $182 billion, while BlackRock and Sony boast a market cap of $173 and $174 billion, respectively. Meanwhile, based on its market cap, XRP currently sits as the 88th largest asset, just behind Xiaomi. It is worth noting that the altcoin has briefly surpassed banking giant Citigroup, Verizon, and Shopify following a rally of over 3% over the weekend. However, XRP has pared some of these gains and now looks to be consolidating in preparation for the next leg to the upside. XRP’s rally comes amid a broad crypto market rally, with other major altcoins like Ethereum, Dogecoin, BNB, and Solana recording significant gains. Some fundamentals could serve as a catalyst for higher XRP prices, as its market cap looks to surpass more companies on the global assets ranking. This includes the launch of the REX-Osprey XRP ETF that is set to take place this week. This will be the first U.S. XRP fund to provide institutional investors with spot exposure to the altcoin. This is expected to inject new liquidity into the XRP ecosystem. Meanwhile, the Fed is expected to make a rate cut at this week’s FOMC meeting. This is typically bullish for altcoins for XRP, although there is also the possibility that it may be a ‘sell the news’ event. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has predicted that the XRP price could rally to $3.6 following its breakout above $3.05. He had earlier stated that there were two possible scenarios. One possibility is that it could break above $3.05 and then rally to $3.60, or it could dip to $2.80, break above $2.90, and then rally to $3.60. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Dark Defender highlighted $3.01 and $2.85 as the major support levels to watch out for as the XRP price prepares for another leg to the upside. The analyst stated that the targets are the $4.39 and the $5.85 Fibonacci levels. A rally to these price levels would mark a new all-time high (ATH) for the altcoin.

Title: Astranis and Impulse Space Sign Agreement for 2027 Mission, Direct-Inject to GEO

September 15, 2025 12:35 ET | Source: Impulse Space Impulse Space REDONDO BEACH, Calif. and SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Impulse Space, the leader for in-space mobility, and Astranis, manufacturer of advanced high-orbit satellites, signed a contract today for an upcoming mission to GEO. Targeting a 2027 launch, the mission will utilize a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launch to low Earth orbit (LEO), where it will deploy Impulse’s Helios kick stage. Leveraging chemical propulsion via its powerful Deneb engine, Helios will then deliver Astranis MicroGEO satellites from LEO to GEO in less than 24 hours, deploying them to their target orbital regime in geostationary orbit. This mission will showcase the capabilities of Astranis and Impulse to rapidly deploy satellites to geostationary orbit without the use of a Heavy-class rocket, a mission profile appealing to government and commercial customers alike. Astranis satellites provide dedicated, secure, enterprise-grade communications from GEO for customers around the world. Geostationary orbit allows a single satellite to provide 24/7 operational service, but reaching that orbit requires traversing the radiation-laden Van Allen Belts that surround the planet. Traditionally, Astranis satellites have used efficient but low thrust electric propulsion thrusters to make the orbit raise maneuver, which can take months. By using Helios to rapidly transit between orbits, Astranis will avoid the cost and risk of a slower transit, instead arriving at the target destination in a matter of hours after launch. “We selected Impulse’s Helios vehicle for this mission because it offers a faster, more reliable, and more cost-effective way for us to get our satellites operational and delivering service to customers,” said John Gedmark, co-founder and CEO of Astranis. “Demonstrating new methods of rapidly deploying satellites to geostationary orbit is important for both our government and commercial customers, and Impulse is the perfect partner for us in this effort.” “This is exactly the type of mission that Helios is designed for,” said Eric Romo, President and COO of Impulse Space. “By providing rapid transport to higher energy orbits, we help operators like Astranis to begin delivering on their mission promise sooner. And with our vertically-integrated approach to design, manufacturing, and testing, we offer reliability and schedule assurance to further de-risk the mission profile.” Astranis will be flying as the primary payload on the mission, with the potential for secondary payloads to be added later. About Impulse SpaceImpulse Space, the in-space mobility leader, is accelerating our future beyond Earth beginning with its fleet of cost-effective, high-performance space vehicles: Helios and Mira. The Helios kick stage unlocks high-energy orbits with its powerful Deneb engine, rapidly transporting payloads from LEO to MEO, GEO, heliocentric, lunar, and other planetary orbits. The flight-proven Mira enables precise maneuverability and rapid responsiveness for hosting, deployment, and rendezvous and proximity operations (RPO) across any orbit. Founded by Tom Mueller and led by a team of industry pioneers, Impulse Space is transforming in-space mobility by reliably and rapidly getting customers where they want to go. And they're just getting started.

Today Astranis satellites provide dedicated, secure networks to highly-sophisticated customers across the globe—large enterprises, sovereign governments, and the US military. With five satellites on orbit and many more set to launch soon, the company is servicing a backlog of more than $1 billion of commercial contracts. Astranis is the preferred satellite communications partner for buyers with stringent requirements for uptime, data security, network visibility, and customization. Astranis has raised over $750 million from some of the world’s best investors, from Andreessen Horowitz to Blackrock, and Fidelity, and employs a team of 450 engineers and entrepreneurs. Astranis designs, builds, and operates its satellites out of its 153,000 sq. ft. headquarters in Northern California, USA. Contact:contact@astranis.com

The streak ran across all five trading sessions from September 8 to September 12, according to aggregated data from Farside and SoSoValue. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust led with just over $1 billion of inflows, while Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund brought in nearly $850 million. Other issuers, including Ark Invest and Bitwise, also posted gains, though smaller. Daily flows showed steady demand. Monday started with $364 million, followed by a muted $23 million on Tuesday. The pace accelerated to $742 million on Wednesday, $553 million on Thursday, and $642 million on Friday. Last week’s inflows “signal clear demand impulse, the one that looks both meaningful and timely,” Georgii Verbitskii, a derivatives trader and founder of decentralized protocol TYMIO, told Decrypt. With September to October marking “the start of the business season,” Verbitskii notes that the this “often sets the tone for trends that play out through the end of the year.” The base case, he added, is that this could be “the beginning of a new uptrend, with strong potential for further growth into Q4.” Still, while the inflows show a marked return to mid-July levels, “the number itself isn’t transformative on its own,” Wesley Crook, CEO of blockchain engineering firm FP Block, told Decrypt. “Much of this activity is being driven by expectations of rate cuts alongside the broader trend of enterprises entering the market,” Crook said, adding that he expects the momentum to likely continue as institutional allocations for Bitcoin bring “upward pressure on prices.” The surge aligned with growing expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut rates at its next meeting set this week, with users of prediction market Myriad, launched by Decrypt’s parent company DASTAN, placing an 88% chance on a 25bps rate cut. During the same period, Bitcoin's price recovered above $115,000, reinforcing investor optimism. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is changing hands at around $114,600, per CoinGecko data. “Structural demand is the real story here,” Farbod Sadeghian, founder of Dubai-headquartered international virtual asset chamber TheBlock., told Decrypt. While rate cut expectations could provide “a friendlier backdrop for risk assets,” such a setting is temporary, Sadeghian said. “The bigger factor is that investors, especially at the institutional level, now see Bitcoin as an allocation worth holding over the long term,” he said, adding that “the ETF wrapper makes it easier and safer to access, but the underlying appetite is clearly about exposure to the asset itself.” On the broader end, Sadeghian notes that Bitcoin ETF inflows, while “never perfectly smooth,” could expect to “stabilize and scale further” over macro-driven momentum as institutional investors steadily “integrate Bitcoin ETFs into standard portfolios.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: 10 Questions Everyone Is Asking Coinbase’s First Chief Business Officer
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/09/15/10-questions-everyone-is-asking-coinbases-first-chief-business-officer/
Time Published: 2025-09-15T12:15:00Z
Full Content:
BySandy Carter, Contributor. Over the past few weeks, I had the opportunity to sit down with Shan Aggarwal, Coinbase's newly appointed Chief Business Officer—a first-of-its-kind role at the crypto exchange. Shan’s background defies the conventional tech-executive mold: having started on the medical path with a Bachelor of Science in Neuroscience from UCLA, then pivoting and working his way to a position on the forefront of crypto’s corporate strategy, M&A, and partnerships. From managing capital raising and capital markets activity from Coinbase’s 2018 Series E through its 2021 public listing, to rising as one of the youngest executives at a Fortune 500 today, Shan’s leadership comes at a pivotal moment for the company. With institutional demand surging and regulatory clarity emerging, Aggarwal is tasked with driving Coinbase's next phase of growth beyond its roots as a retail trading platform. Here's what he shared about the company's strategy, market outlook, and vision for crypto's mainstream future. My role as Chief Business Officer is really about connecting all the dots across Coinbase’s growth engine. I oversee our ecosystem partnerships, business operations and strategy, data and analytics, M&A, and investments. Think of it as being the bridge between our product teams and the market opportunities we're seeing, defining what we should do and how we should execute. I'm focused on how we grow Coinbase, not just as a trading platform, but as the infrastructure that powers the entire crypto economy. That means working with institutions, retail partners, and emerging projects to embed crypto into the core of global financial infrastructure. First, we're focused on building the best trading products by adding support for assets beyond crypto in order to cater to traders. This includes equities, futures and perpetual futures, crypto-native assets, prediction markets, and more. Second, we're leveraging the platform that we've built to enable institutional adoption. Enterprise demand is massive right now, and we've built this amazing platform that's turnkey for partners to offer crypto trading, staking, and more to their end users. Third, we're focused on payments and expanding stablecoin adoption. We're building products that enable first-party payments and a platform for other businesses to offer crypto payments. Throughout these priorities, we remain focused on international expansion: scaling our global footprint and driving our mission to expand economic freedom for people and businesses everywhere. Growth today is about quality over quantity. We're not chasing vanity metrics. It's about deepening relationships with our highest-value customers and expanding our share of their crypto needs. That means driving deeper engagement with our customers by broadening the range of services that we offer to include more than trading – saving, spending, financing, and more. We're also seeing huge opportunities in B2B growth – powering other companies' crypto strategies rather than just serving end consumers directly. We call this Crypto as a Service. With increasing regulatory clarity, we can offer white-label solutions and infrastructure APIs that let other companies integrate crypto without building from scratch. The enterprise builder ecosystem is massive. Think about all the fintech companies, payment processors, and traditional businesses that want crypto capabilities but don't want to deal with compliance, custody, or technical complexity. We become their crypto backbone. We're seeing this through our partnerships with BlackRock and PNC using our infrastructure for their institutional crypto services, and companies like Perplexity integrating crypto data into their platform. These partnerships are game-changing because they bring crypto to users who might never download a crypto app. We’re not just growing our direct user base, we're powering crypto adoption across the entire digital economy. This approach allows us to broaden the base of end users that we serve and accelerate crypto adoption. Stablecoins represent a platform shift in payments. We believe that all of the asset classes in the world will eventually come onchain, and we see stablecoins as one of the first and most important categories. The regulatory clarity that we're starting to see legitimizes stablecoins and sets a clear foundation for growth with a consistent framework for essential components like reserve requirements and transparency. I think we'll see a bifurcation between compliant, transparent stablecoins and everything else. The winners will be the operators who work closely with regulators rather than against them. We’re already starting to see stablecoins get more deeply integrated into the traditional financial system, and I expect that this will continue as stablecoins offer a more efficient, global, and lower-cost rail for moving dollars. Overall, a digital economy needs digital money — stablecoins are that missing piece. And Coinbase is uniquely positioned post-GENIUS Act with broad USDC distribution and the ability to offer industry-leading rewards. We’re building for the long-term and thinking across cycles. In bear markets, we focus on scaling our infrastructure to support the next waves of adoption and investing in long-term builders. In bull markets, we focus on optimizing the customer experience and new product innovation. We're investing heavily in Coinbase as a platform because we believe that with regulatory clarity, more and more businesses will come into the space. We're also building new revenue streams that are less correlated with transaction volumes: stablecoin interest, custody fees, staking rewards, and more. The goal is to be anti-fragile regardless of where prices go. Traditional finance will play a pivotal role in crypto’s mainstream adoption by acting as a bridge between legacy systems and decentralized financial ecosystems. As CBO, I see partnerships with institutions like JPMorgan Chase and American Express as critical to accelerating adoption. These collaborations expand access to crypto, lower barriers for consumers, and integrate crypto into everyday financial activities, such as payments and rewards programs. (Read about Coinbase’s partnership with Perplexity as well.) By leveraging the trust and infrastructure of traditional finance, we can onboard the next wave of users into crypto, helping make economic freedom a reality for millions globally. We’re already seeing this now. We're seeing that those who were skeptical are asking how to custody Bitcoin for their clients, asset managers wanting crypto ETFs and index products, and payment companies seeking stablecoin rails. Our job is to be the infrastructure that lets them participate safely and compliantly. TradFi is meeting crypto, and Coinbase is the bridge. Real-world assets are huge right now. Tokenizing everything from real estate to commodities is unlocking new markets and creating liquidity where it didn’t exist before. DeFi is also maturing beyond just yield farming, becoming the backbone of new, legitimate financial infrastructure. At Coinbase, we believe the future of every asset class is onchain, and we’re laser-focused on building the infrastructure to make that vision a reality. The key is identifying use cases that solve real-world problems at real-world scale, not just fueling crypto-native speculation, although that’s important too. While we're excited about the steps the US has been taking toward regulatory clarity, there are massive opportunities globally in markets where the rules are clearer and the opportunities are immediate. Regions like Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America are moving fast on crypto regulation and adoption, and we’re matching that pace by building local partnerships and compliance capabilities tailored to each region. While the US remains a critical market, we won’t let an incomplete regulatory picture here hold back our global ambitions. Crypto is a global phenomenon, and we’re positioning Coinbase to lead on that stage. We have and will continue to be very active on the M&A front. We believe that M&A is core to our growth engine, and a capability that we’ve built up over the years. Once we define a strategy, we always consider build, buy, and partner execution paths. We build core platform capabilities in-house because that's our bread and butter, and we need these to be deeply integrated with our platform. When we acquire, we’re looking for opportunities that accelerate our roadmap and bring differentiated technology, expertise, licensing, and/or a scaled business into our suite. Recent examples include Deribit, the leading crypto options exchange, as well as Spindl, a novel onchain advertising protocol and exchange. With these acquisitions, we’re strengthening our product capabilities and seeding new revenue opportunities. We also believe in the strength of amazing talent and have done smaller acqui-hires to bring in specialized teams. The key is integration – acquisitions only work if they strengthen our core platform rather than becoming isolated silos. I want Coinbase to be the best place for users, institutions, and their end clients to store and grow their wealth. Customers should know that they have access to differentiated opportunities on Coinbase, all through our trusted and intuitive products. That’s what we’re building towards: an everything exchange and full-fledged financial platform. Every asset you want to trade in a one-stop shop, and the best place to grow your money and manage everyday finances, all on crypto rails. Further, I want Coinbase to be synonymous with crypto infrastructure the way AWS is with cloud computing. Base is building a future onchain economy that powers a range of onchain crypto use cases, including financial, social, and much more. Whether you're a startup launching a token, a bank offering crypto services, or a country exploring digital currencies, Coinbase should be the trusted infrastructure partner. We want to be essential rather than optional, powering innovation across every sector that touches crypto. What I learned from my conversation with Shan is that Coinbase isn’t just preparing for the next bull run—it’s building the rails for crypto’s long-term future. The strategy is less about chasing hype cycles and more about embedding crypto into everyday finance, from powering institutional adoption to expanding stablecoin use cases and international markets. Shan made it clear that quality growth, deeper customer relationships, and serving as the “crypto backbone” for enterprises are the levers that matter most right now. I also walked away with a sharper view of Coinbase’s ambition: to become the “everything exchange” for digital assets and the AWS of crypto infrastructure. Whether it’s tokenizing real-world assets, creating compliant and trusted stablecoins, or bridging traditional finance with Web3, Shan’s vision is that Coinbase won’t just participate in the future of money. It will help define it. That’s a bold mission, and one I’ll be watching closely for Coinbase’s next moves.

Title: 10 Questions Everyone’s Asking Coinbase’s First Chief Business Officer

BySandy Carter, Contributor. Over the past few weeks, I had the opportunity to sit down with Shan Aggarwal, Coinbase's newly appointed Chief Business Officer—a first-of-its-kind role at the crypto exchange. Shan’s background defies the conventional tech-executive mold: having started on the medical path with a Bachelor of Science in Neuroscience from UCLA, then pivoting and working his way to a position on the forefront of crypto’s corporate strategy, M&A, and partnerships. From managing capital raising and capital markets activity from Coinbase’s 2018 Series E through its 2021 public listing, to rising as one of the youngest executives at a Fortune 500 today, Shan’s leadership comes at a pivotal moment for the company. With institutional demand surging and regulatory clarity emerging, Aggarwal is tasked with driving Coinbase's next phase of growth beyond its roots as a retail trading platform. Here's what he shared about the company's strategy, market outlook, and vision for crypto's mainstream future. My role as Chief Business Officer is really about connecting all the dots across Coinbase’s growth engine. I oversee our ecosystem partnerships, business operations and strategy, data and analytics, M&A, and investments. Think of it as being the bridge between our product teams and the market opportunities we're seeing, defining what we should do and how we should execute. I'm focused on how we grow Coinbase, not just as a trading platform, but as the infrastructure that powers the entire crypto economy. That means working with institutions, retail partners, and emerging projects to embed crypto into the core of global financial infrastructure. First, we're focused on building the best trading products by adding support for assets beyond crypto in order to cater to traders. This includes equities, futures and perpetual futures, crypto-native assets, prediction markets, and more. Second, we're leveraging the platform that we've built to enable institutional adoption. Enterprise demand is massive right now, and we've built this amazing platform that's turnkey for partners to offer crypto trading, staking, and more to their end users. Third, we're focused on payments and expanding stablecoin adoption. We're building products that enable first-party payments and a platform for other businesses to offer crypto payments. Throughout these priorities, we remain focused on international expansion: scaling our global footprint and driving our mission to expand economic freedom for people and businesses everywhere. Growth today is about quality over quantity. We're not chasing vanity metrics. It's about deepening relationships with our highest-value customers and expanding our share of their crypto needs. That means driving deeper engagement with our customers by broadening the range of services that we offer to include more than trading – saving, spending, financing, and more. We're also seeing huge opportunities in B2B growth – powering other companies' crypto strategies rather than just serving end consumers directly. We call this Crypto as a Service. With increasing regulatory clarity, we can offer white-label solutions and infrastructure APIs that let other companies integrate crypto without building from scratch. The enterprise builder ecosystem is massive. Think about all the fintech companies, payment processors, and traditional businesses that want crypto capabilities but don't want to deal with compliance, custody, or technical complexity. We become their crypto backbone. We're seeing this through our partnerships with BlackRock and PNC using our infrastructure for their institutional crypto services, and companies like Perplexity integrating crypto data into their platform. These partnerships are game-changing because they bring crypto to users who might never download a crypto app. We’re not just growing our direct user base, we're powering crypto adoption across the entire digital economy. This approach allows us to broaden the base of end users that we serve and accelerate crypto adoption. Stablecoins represent a platform shift in payments. We believe that all of the asset classes in the world will eventually come onchain, and we see stablecoins as one of the first and most important categories. The regulatory clarity that we're starting to see legitimizes stablecoins and sets a clear foundation for growth with a consistent framework for essential components like reserve requirements and transparency. I think we'll see a bifurcation between compliant, transparent stablecoins and everything else. The winners will be the operators who work closely with regulators rather than against them.

Title: RWM Makes Barron’s Top 100 RIA Firms!

September 15, 2025 8:00am by Barry Ritholtz I am thrilled that Ritholtz Wealth Management has been recognized by Barron’s as one of the top 100 RIAs in the country. They report there are 15,870 independent registered investment advisory firms (RIAs); Top 100 means better than the top 1% of all firms.1 When we launched in 2013, twelve years ago (today!), as four advisors and an amazing admin who ran the place (Erika!), Kris Venne convinced all of us that an ensemble practice was the way to go. That turned out to be the best decision we made, as each of us gravitated to what we did best. A flywheel effect followed, with all of the founders expanding their expertise, creating momentum and high double-digit growth for more than a decade. All organically, without outside capital or M&A.2 None of this could have happened without that decision, nor could it have taken place without the 80 fantastic people who make RWM the very special place it is today. This is not false modesty; it is simply an acknowledgement of how proud I am to get to work with so many amazing people. Barron’s has always been special to me personally (I am old school). When I started as a trader 30 years ago(!), every Saturday morning was spent with a big mug of coffee and the print edition of the weekly Barron’s. I was thrilled to be quoted in August 2007 (Placid Times Ahead?), with the GFC looming.3 The first thing I ever published in a mainstream media outlet was a Memo to DC from Wall Street4 – the precursor to Bailout Nation. Thomas Donlan taught me what a great editor can do for your writing – make it all sinew and no fat. I have spoken at multiple Barron’s conferences, seminars, and events; they have always been wonderful experiences. When Barron’s ran a special article on Josh and me in 2020,5, it was thrilling. I was utterly delighted when Batnick was the focus of a profile in 2022.6 Over just this past year, my RWM colleagues and I have been quoted in Barron’s 20 times. To say this is meaningful to me dramatically understates the matter… ~~~ If you are an investor and would like to learn more about how we work with clients, please contact us at Info-AT-RitholtzWealth-DOT-Com. And if you are an advisor or in the financial industry and need some career guidance, we would love to chat with you. Please reach out to the same address, with ‘CAREER’ in the subject line.

Ritholtz Sept 29, 2008 Batnick: Crushing It With Content (February 6, 2022) __________ 1. Top 0.62% to be precise. There are ~17,000 firms, of which 15kish are registered with the S.E.C. That is to say nothing of all of the hybrid Broker-Dealers, and all the advisors at wire houses. FINRA reports there are 634,500 registered representatives in total. 2. When Blackrock decided in 2022 that their 2015 purchase of Future Advisor (their robo) was no longer their core focus, we agreed to purchase the book in 2023 and service those clients in our digital platform, with a live human advisor included. 3. Placid Times Ahead? By Jim McTague, Aug 06, 2007 4. A Memo Found in the Street By Barry L. Ritholtz Barron’s, Sept 29, 2008 As I wrote at the time, “It was a pleasure working with Thom Donlan on this, who turned my blunt, meandering scribbles into a razor-sharp scalpel.” 5. Barry Ritholtz and Josh Brown Won’t Predict The Market, But They’ll Talk About Anything Else. By Leslie P. Norton Barron’s, Dec 18, 2020 6. Michael Batnick: Crushing It With Content By Steve Garmhausen Barron’s Feb. 4, 2022 ~~~ Disclosure: Barron’s ranked Ritholtz Wealth Management (RWM) #100 in their 2025 “Barron’s Top RIA Firms” in September, 2025. The annual ranking is based on data compiled for RWM’s registered investment adviser and was based on June 30th data, including annual figures for the previous three years. No fee was paid for participation in the ranking. The ranking is based on firm surveys, and filings with the regulatory databases were used to cross-check the data provided. The rankings are based on assets managed by the firms, growth, technology spending, staff diversity, succession planning, and other metrics. The formula Barron’s uses to rank firms is proprietary. The formula features three major categories of calculations: (1) Assets (2) Revenue (3) Quality of practice. The number of firms included in the 2025 ranking was 100. For the first time, Barron’s is ranking the largest registered investment advisor firms separately from its broader RIA ranking. For our list of mega RIAs, we selected firms that manage 2% or more of the total assets of all ranking applicants. This year, that creates a threshold of $70 billion in assets.

Title: Tether’s long-awaited arrival to U.S. raises 3 big questions
URL: https://fortune.com/crypto/2025/09/15/tether-united-states-arrival-paolo-ardoino-analysis/
Time Published: 2025-09-15T11:42:15Z
Full Content:
Jeff John Roberts is the Finance and Crypto editor at Fortune, overseeing coverage of the blockchain and how technology is changing finance. Don’t look now but an overseas crypto colossus has just strode onto America’s shores. I’m talking, of course, about Tether. For over a decade, the wildcat stablecoin firm operated as a global nomad before announcing in January it would set up a physical headquarters in El Salvador. Then, on Friday, founder Paolo Ardoino turned up in New York City to announce Tether would be launching a new U.S.-compliant stablecoin called USAT. It’s a remarkable turnabout. For years, Tether was viewed as an outlaw that turned a blind eye to criminals who used its USDT stablecoin to launder profits, and to facilitate pig-butchering and other scams. Now, the company is in the tent with other respectable crypto companies. The CEO of its U.S. entity is none other than Bo Hines, the 30-year-old former Yale wide receiver whose most recent gig was at the White House, helping implement President Donald Trump’s ambitious crypto agenda. It must have cost a pretty penny to land Hines, who recently told Fortune he was weighing over 50 job offers. Fortunately, for Tether, money is pretty much an afterthought since the firm says it made $13 billion in profits in 2024, which gives it a staggering warchest to make a play for the U.S. market, which is dominated by rival Circle. All of this raises three questions. The first is whether there is room for another big player in the U.S. stablecoin market, which has so far played out as a winner-take-all contest in favor of Tether’s main rival, Circle. Marquee brands like PayPal and Ripple have tried to make inroads but have failed to capture even 5% of the U.S. market from Circle’s USDC. This suggests Circle’s existing customer base is a sticky one that is not looking to hop to another stablecoin. This does, though, raise the question of whether Circle is ready for a competitor like Tether. The company’s competitive advantage till now has been on the regulatory front, where its compliance-first strategy has served it well. That strategy, though, hasn’t trained it to go up against a knife-fighter like Tether, a company that is deeply crypto-native and whose corporate culture is nimble and lean. This likely explains why Circle’s shares dropped 6% on Friday. The final question posed by Tether’s entry into the U.S. is why it decided to create a new stablecoin in the first place rather than simply going to market with its popular USDT coin. This raises the perennial question of whether Tether’s USDT reserves are up to snuff. For years now, the company has produced quarterly “attestations” to show its house is in order—but has never submitted to an audit by a Big Four firm that would settle the question once and for all. Is this going to change now that Tether, under U.S. law, will have to arrange full-blown audits for USAT? We’ll see. A final note: Thanks to all of you who sent kind words about the return of the Fortune Crypto newsletter. It is so good to be back in your inboxes to offer you a timely (and succinct!) take on the biggest stories in blockchain. Read on for recent highlights from the news. And if you haven’t already, sign up here. Jeff John Roberts jeff.roberts@fortune.com@jeffjohnroberts Can Stripe be trusted? Boosters say the payment giant’s Tempo blockchain will decentralize, but skeptics warn it “returns us back to the ass-covering hell” that Satoshi warned of. (The Defiant) Beware Bitcoin ATMs: The machines are facilitating a mind-blowing level of senior fraud, according to a new DOJ lawsuit, which accuses Athena Bitcoin of turning a blind eye while charging fees around 25%. (The American Prospect) Blackrock to put ETFs on chain: Tokenization—putting real world assets on a blockchain —has been gathering steam for a while, but is now poised to take a big leap forward as the world’s biggest asset manager moves to put its flagship Bitcoin ETF on chain. (Bloomberg) AI + crypto—really. Double-barrel buzzwords are usually a cue to run far away. The Bittensor project may be an exception, though, in part due to founder Barry Silbert’s decade of wins in the crypto space. (Fortune) The state of Coinbase: The FT, putting aside its longtime enmity towards crypto, offers a worthy 360 look at Coinbase and its diverse revenue streams, and how the arrival of Wall Street is both a threat and opportunity (FT) This week’s Main Character in crypto is Dan Ives, a ubiquitous Wall Street analyst known for his bullish takes on Tesla and AI firms. Ives will now be bringing his “full-steam ahead” catchphrase to a new DAT called EightCo, where he is chair, and whose focus is acquiring Worldcoin tokens.

Title: 21 Companies Hiring Hybrid-Remote Jobs In 2025

ByRachel Wells, Contributor. Between remote work and full-on RTO mandates, emerges a lovechild: the hybrid work model. Hybrid remote jobs are increasingly popular post-pandemic amongst both employers and workers because they hit the sweet spot. Companies gain in-person engagement, visibility, and the team morale that comes through vibing at the office. And employees get to work from home for some part of the week, which means they obtain the best of both worlds. As far as flexibility and returning to the office is concerned, companies have increasingly been sharpening their hybrid remote model approach. This has led to three general types of hybrid remote work: The first scenario, is where employees get to pick what days of the week or month they work in the office versus from home, as long as they adhere to a certain percentage or fixed office versus home ratio. The second, is where employers mandate a certain number of days per week for in-office work. The third option is for employers to mandate specific days, i.e., Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, for in-office work, while the other days are for remote working. Other hybrid approaches that work for some employers include: If you’re keen on experiencing the remote work flexible lifestyle while also enjoying just a little bit of in-office culture, FlexJobs has a list of employers that you should keep on your radar. They gathered this list through analyzing “approximately 60,000 companies and their hybrid job posting histories in the FlexJobs database between September 1, 2024, and August 31, 2025. The featured companies are recognized for having the highest volume of hybrid job openings over the last year and are considered strong prospects for job seekers,” they said. This led to their Top 100 Hybrid Companies List, which also saw 60 newcomers compared to last year’s report. The top 10 employers on this list primarily feature finance and healthcare, while other industries such as communications and defence are included: Lockheed Martin was one of the newcomers to this list and claimed the top spot for posting the most hybrid remote jobs over the one-year period. Some of the other employers in this list include: Now that you have this list, here’s what you should do next: Follow these companies on LinkedIn (if you’re not following them already). Then, identify the hybrid roles they’re advertizing for, which align with your area of expertise or your transferable skills. Next, study their tone, their values, their work culture, and the reviews from their employees on Glassdoor, as well as the corporate tone of their management and senior employees on LinkedIn. And finally, use this intelligence as the basis for crafting your resume and cover letter (and even your LinkedIn profile) so your job application can be tailored specifically to what they’re looking for in their next exceptional employee. Show that you’re aligned with their mission and values. Looking for more remote-friendly companies hiring now in 2025?

September 15, 2025 15:49 IST 'India is quickly becoming the beating heart of modern chess, and its role as an economic power is more and more visible.' Goa will host the 2025 World Corporate Chess Championship alongside the FIDE World Cup 2025 slated during October-November, said the International Chess Federation or FIDE. FIDE has opened the registration for gthe World Corporate Chess Championship 2025 which will be held in three stages. According to FIDE the title-winning corporate will be crowned 'The Smartest Company in the World'. 'The championship will unfold across three stages; online qualifiers, online knockout matches, and the over-the-board finals in Goa, India, held alongside the prestigious FIDE World Cup 2025,' FIDE said. The tournament will once again highlight how certain principles of chess such as strategy, adaptability and calculated decision-making, mirror the challenges of the business world. By bringing employees, executives, and business owners together over the chessboard, FIDE aims to create a global platform for corporate pride, networking, and competition. 'The World Corporate Chess Championship has grown from a novel idea into a global showcase, mixing serious business with serious chess. In 2021 due to the pandemic it was held entirely online, but in New York 2024, teams from top companies around the world -- Google, Deutscheâ¯Bank, Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, UBS, to name a few, competed in this event on the most iconic stage,' FIDE CEO Emil Sutovsky said. In 2025, FIDE is aligning the chess and corporate world even tighter, staging the final stage of the event in Goa, alongside the FIDE World Cup. 'India is quickly becoming the beating heart of modern chess, and its role as an economic power is more and more visible -- this double-stage event reflects the momentum,' Sutovsky said. According to FIDE, teams representing any legally recognised company can participate in the event. Each team consists of four players and a captain, who may also be a player. Eligible participants include employees and board members who have been with the company since March 1, 2025, as well as business owners holding more than 10% of the company's shares. Companies may register more than one team. The 2025 edition will be played in three stages: Online Qualifiers (Lichess.org, October 11 to 12) Online Knockout (Lichess.org, October 18) Finals (Over-the-board, Goa, November 14 to 16) The Online Knockout will be played as two-match duels with the same 10+3 time control. In the event of a tie, a sudden death game will decide the winner. Eight teams will advance to the finals. The finals in Goa will feature the eight knockout winners plus invited and wild card teams, for a maximum of 16 teams. They will begin with a group stage before progressing to semi-finals and a final. The entry fee is €500 per team, and multiple teams per company are allowed. Last year's edition, held in New York, saw 64 teams representing 46 companies from 26 countries across four continents competing in the online qualifying stage. Chessify won the title in 2024.

Title: How ETF Issuers Are Attracting ‘Kid-in-a-Candy-Store Money’

As new ETFs launch at breakneck speed, expensive products are raking in revenue. Lilly Riddle lilly@thedailyupside.com With the number of ETF strategies exploding, figuring out which ones are actually worthwhile is growing more complicated than ever. Exchange-traded funds brought in $540 billion in assets in the first half of the year alone, and the sheer number of ETF launches is overcrowding the markets, according to ETF.com president Dave Nadig. This time next year, the number of ETFs in the US could reach 9,000, given the current pace of launches. “That makes everybody’s job really miserable,” he said during a panel at the Future Proof conference in Huntington Beach, California. “You have to wade through that to find out what’s actually worth having.” There are a few major trends impacting ETF investors heading into 2026, according to Nadig, who previously worked on some of the earliest ETFs as a managing director at Barclays Global Investors. Cheap funds are experiencing massive inflows while products with higher fees are driving revenue for a handful of lucky first-movers. “I think we may have reached the bottom on the fee wars,” Nadig said. Despite all the active ETF hype, most of this year’s inflows have gone to “non-traditional” funds, such as synthetic income funds, which track an index using derivative contracts instead of actually buying the securities. Other options-based income products have generated $366 million in new fee revenue this year, according to Nadig, with leveraged and inverse ETFs, as well as buffers, being the other two major successful categories. Interestingly, it’s not Vanguard, State Street and BlackRock making all the money right now, Nadig said. Issuers such as First Trust and Innovator are raking in hundreds of millions on the backs of their buffered and derivatives-based products. “A lot of this [gets] called active management and certainly charges active management-like fees,” he said. “But it’s not the kind of active management you’re going to get from Tom Lee down at Fundstrat, where he’s picking stocks.” Since leveraged, inverse and buffered products are newer, issuers are focusing on them to gain a foothold in the market. Cheap Date. Although the vast majority of investments are in extraordinarily cheap products, more sophisticated funds can still be worthwhile strategies for issuers, Nadig said. That’s because a smaller group of very expensive funds accounts for an outsized share of revenue: For example, JPMorgan and Toroso Investments — the maker of YieldMax ETFs — dominate the synthetic income bracket. “It doesn’t mean that there’s no money to be made elsewhere,” Nadig said. “But the expensive stuff is just kid-in-a-candy-store money.” The firm’s founder claims a new ETF using fundamentals beyond market-cap weighting to determine holdings is the next big thing. Funds holding large financial institutions have significantly outperformed broad market indices this year. The exchange could start offering tokenization of securities, including exchange-traded products and stocks, next year. Amid a reversal in tax incentives that had started to buoy clean energy technologies, investors have pulled money from linked ETFs. The company, which sponsors a nearly $5 billion Bitcoin ETF along with ARK, is nixing the three other ETFs in that partnership. The SEC and CFTC recently issued a rare joint statement encouraging applications for new spot crypto products. Disney is the comeback kid of Wall Street, and other streaming giants are following suit. The company’s new U.S. Equity Total Return ETF invests in other exchange-traded funds in a way that minimizes dividend payments. If approved, Tuttle Capital Management would buck an industry trend in the options it uses, according to the company’s CEO. Stocks in rapidly emerging markets have been outperforming their so-called developed counterparts due, in part, to a depreciating US dollar. The company’s asset manager, Raymond James Investment Management, has been prepping a line of four ETFs since last year. There isn’t an ETF for everything, but the volume of leveraged products coming to market shows a strategy of filling any voids. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: Native Markets clinches USDH ticker to issue Hyperliquid’s native stablecoin

The Native Markets team said they will soon start a testing phase for USDH mints and redemptions. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Validators on Hyperliquid have voted to hand the long-reserved USDH ticker to Native Markets, clearing the way for the project to issue the network’s native stablecoin. Native Markets co-founder Max Fiege announced the outcome on Sept. 14, saying HYPE stakers and validator operators supported the proposal. According to him: “Native Markets has been awarded the USDH ticker on Hyperliquid. Thank you to all HYPE stakers and network validators for their time and effort in reviewing the proposals put forward.” Native Markets’ victory came against stiff competition from major stablecoin issuers, including Ethena, Paxos, and Agora. Each rival pitched aggressive revenue-sharing models to strengthen Hyperliquid’s ecosystem, offering to funnel yield into buybacks or ecosystem growth. However, Native Markets’ proposal resonated with validators thanks to its detailed reserve structure, compliance safeguards, and the leadership team’s deep involvement with the decentralized exchange. Native Markets was formed specifically to develop USDH, with the aim of reducing the $200 million in annual value leakage the Hyperliquid protocol has faced. The project submitted its proposal less than two hours after Hyperliquid first announced the stablecoin, stressing its determination to lead the effort. The proposal outlined that USDH will be issued directly on Hyperliquid’s HyperEVM network. Reserves will be fully backed by US Treasuries and cash, with on-chain assets managed by Superstate through Bridge and off-chain reserves initially held by BlackRock. For compliance, issuance will run through Bridge, which already holds money transmission and MSB licenses in both the US and Europe. Meanwhile, revenue from the stablecoin reserves will be split evenly, with half directed to HYPE buybacks and the Assistance Fund, and the other half dedicated to expanding USDH adoption. According to Feige, his team is committed to deploying both the HIP-1 version of USDH and an ERC-20 token. He said the rollout would begin with a capped testing phase, allowing traders to mint and redeem tokens in transactions of up to $800. Once initial trials are complete, the team plans to open the USDH/USDC spot order book and enable unlimited mints and redemptions. To accommodate institutional-scale activity, Native Markets also intends to make its API available for large-volume traders during testing. According to Fiege, this approach ensures robust liquidity and smooth integration into Hyperliquid’s trading environment. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: This new fund from an ex-BlackRock exec is bringing the Wall Street playbook behind music royalties to tech
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/althera42-royalties-based-tech-infrastructure-fund-former-blackrock-exec-2025-9
Time Published: 2025-09-15T08:00:02Z
Full Content:
Royalties from artists like Fleetwood Mac or Justin Bieber have become big bets for investors. Althera42 wants to copy that playbook for the tech world. The new fund, launched by former BlackRock executive Caspar Macqueen and Christian Czernich, who founded private credit firm Round2 Capital, plans to provide working capital to companies building Europe's digital infrastructure — think data centers and cloud computing — without taking a stake in companies. "Althera42's royalty investments allow companies to access capital without diluting equity or taking on rigid debt obligations," a factsheet on the new firm published last week states. Focused on late-stage private companies, Althera42's deals will exchange capital upfront for a fixed percentage of future revenues over several years. The money is not a loan, as the manager is not looking to just be paid the initial capital investment plus a fixed interest rate. It is a bet on the revenue growth and scalability of the companies they find, without having to buy in at the sky-high valuations that top startups are demanding for equity. While private credit has been all the rage for years, with more than $260 billion raised in 2025's first quarter alone, according to Pitchbook, Czernich said the royalties model allows the firm to combine the upside of venture capital with the steady cash flow of private debt. The fund will send any gains to investors quarterly, Macqueen said, and charge a 2% management fee and 20% performance fee. The firm's first fund hopes to pull in $300 million and do between 15 and 20 deals, mostly across Europe and the UK, with the potential for some North American investments, said Macqueen, who was the head of BlackRock's UK, Middle East, and Africa for the alternatives business of Aladdin, the firm's widely used risk and analytics platform. The factsheet outlining the fund's plans states that it is seeking companies with between €10 and €100 million in annual revenue (roughly $17 million to $117 million) from "recurring or licensing-based models" that have "defensible IP, low churn, and diversified customer bases." Macqueen imagines most of the money being deployed in France, Germany, Scandinavia, and the UK, and the firm plans to have offices in London, New York, and a still-undecided location in continental Europe, possibly Munich, where Czernich has worked from previously. Other industries, like pharmaceuticals and music, have seen royalties investing come in and out of style over the years. Big names have put capital to work to tap into revenue streams from different industries. Private equity giant KKR purchased a majority stake in healthcare royalties investor HCRx last month, and Blackstone's 2024 purchase of Hipgnosis makes it one of the biggest music royalties investors in the world. However, structuring the deal around future revenues instead of intellectual property is somewhat novel. For Czernich, who has done dozens of private market deals in Europe over his career, royalties investing has the potential for something much bigger than just strong returns for Althera42's investors. "I do genuinely believe it will be a new asset class," he said. Jump to

Title: Calls for review of east coast railway protection plan

Samantha Libreri Eastern Correspondent Plans aimed at preventing the railway line between south Dublin and Wicklow from falling into the sea in future years could result in major changes along parts of the eastern coastline. Irish Rail wants to place large boulders on a number of beaches and raise sea walls, blocking the view of Dublin Bay on parts of the train journey to try to stop the impact of extreme weather events and coastal erosion on the track, which has already lost lands around it of up to 30 metres over the past decade. But opponents say the East Coast Railway Infrastructure Protection Project needs to be reconsidered. Watch: Iarnród Éireann's Cian Lynch on the rail line Iarnród Éireann said the 65km of track that runs from Merrion Gates in south Dublin to Wicklow harbour is vulnerable to the effect of storm surges and climate change. To make the rail more resilient it is planning significant interventions at five locations along the route, which include placing large boulders on a number of beaches along the east coast, including White Rock in Killiney. Project Manager of the East Coast Railway Infrastructure Protection Project Cian Lynch said they are proposing the measures to limit disruption of services and to future proof the rail infrastructure. "In recent years, we in Irish Rail have seen more and more occurrences of wave over topping, coastal erosion along this line that necessitates more and more maintenance works, which also results in disruption for services. "As climate change takes hold, that is getting more challenging for us and we do foresee that it will impact services if we don't do something about it now. So several years ago, we took a decision to take a strategic look at this line and to provide more long term permanent protection to coastal erosion and wave over topping, and to factor in climate change as well." The plans include placing large boulders on a number of beaches and raising sea walls in places which will obscure the view of Dublin Bay along parts of the rail journey. Mr Lynch said the measures have been amended in places following an initial public consultation and are being proposed to target particular issues on each of the five locations. "It is quite a scenic and well-known piece of rail infrastructure across the world, and it's very popular for being so close to the sea, that obviously means it is quite exposed. We have just a number of issues at play. "On Killiney beach it's predominantly erosion of the embankments that supports the rail line, further north between Merrion and Seapoint it's wave overtopping and as we head further south towards Wicklow it is more of an erosion issue. So the solutions we're proposing have been adapted to suit the particular locations and to deal with the specific issues in those areas." He said part of the sea walls will be made of glass to allow for a view near some rail stations and that while the size of some beaches may be reduced due to the erection of boulders, access routes to the public will be maintained and improved in some places. 'Compromise' needs to be found However, some believe the plans need to be reconsidered. Fine Gael local representative for Blackrock Cllr Marie Baker said she believes the plans have been over engineered and do not take into account the human impact of the proposed changes. "I fear that it would mean you'll be actually in a DART with your view totally blocked of Dublin Bay and that worries me. I understand they need to secure the line into the future from climate change and storms. We've seen it in the past, unfortunately. But I think what they're proposing seems draconian, to say the least. "A little bit of the crack the nut with a big hammer. I think they need to be more conscious of people's views. I think they need to find a compromise. I can understand that we're going to lose some of our view in Dublin Bay. But do we need to lose it all? I just feel they need to interrogate that a bit more. "I think their proposal is over engineered. I think they need to think about people. There's things there that I don't think have been thought about. I think it would bring lots of sadness to people." Irish Rail said it is eager to receive feedback on the plans as part of its own public consultation which runs until 13 October. A statutory public consultation process will then follow and subject to planning permission, it hopes to begin work, which is estimated to take two to three years by 2029. These five Coastal Cell Areas make up ECRIPP, and are: · CCA1: Merrion to Dún Laoghaire · CCA2-3: Dalkey Tunnel to Shanganagh - Bray Wastewater Treatment Plant · CCA5: Bray Head to Greystones North Beach · CCA6.1: Greystones South to Newcastle · CCA6.2: Newcastle to Wicklow Chief Executive of Iarnród Éireann Jim Meade said: "To provide the best possible solution we want to hear from our neighbours and those that enjoy the coastal amenities along this route and I would urge as many people as possible to give us their feedback". Irish Rail said more details of the plans are available on its website. Eastern Correspondent © RTÉ 2025. RTÉ.ie is the website of Raidió Teilifís Éireann, Ireland's National Public Service Media.

The newly formed firm edged out established bidders after prediction markets and validator commitments swung heavily in its favor, capping one of the most closely watched governance decisions in crypto this year. Ethena, once considered a strong challenger, withdrew from the race on Thursday. The firm cited feedback from validators and community members questioning whether its proposal, anchored in its existing non-native infrastructure, met the spirit of the competition. Its exit further pushed prediction odds on Myriad for Native Markets above 90% and effectively cleared the path, with Paxos left trailing despite revising its proposal midweek. Disclosure: Myriad Markets is owned by Decrypt’s parent company Dastan. Despite the broad concurrence, the voting process drew criticism. Observers argued the compressed request-for-proposals timeline, combined with validator ties to existing Hyperliquid infrastructure, tilted the playing field in favor of Native Markets. Max Fiege, founder of Native Markets, outlined a phased rollout in a statement on Sunday. The first step will be the introduction of a Hyperliquid Improvement Proposal, after which mints and redeems of USDH will begin in a controlled trial. Early participants will be capped at about $800 per transaction to stress-test the system. Once initial checks are complete, the USDH/USDC spot order book will open on Hyperliquid, followed by full minting and redemption functionality for all users. With Native Market securing the USDH ticker, the closely watched governance vote “cements Hyperliquid as a fast-growing ecosystem” but also shows the “intensifying stablecoin competition,” Vincent Liu, chief investment officer at Kronos Research, told Decrypt. Governance-led moves and fresh liquidity being poured into Hyperliquid show that “stablecoins remain central to crypto’s next phase of global adoption,” Liu added. Native Markets had been the frontrunner throughout the contest. Its proposal emphasized a native alignment with Hyperliquid: cash reserves and U.S. Treasuries managed by BlackRock off-chain. Tokenized reserves, meanwhile, will be handled on-chain by Superstate through Bridge, Stripe’s stablecoin infrastructure provider. The team also pledged to split all reserve yield equally between Hyperliquid’s Assistance Fund and ecosystem growth. Backers include operators and investors with track records at Uniswap Labs, Paradigm, and Polychain. These elements, combined with early validator endorsements from groups such as CMI Trading, gave Native Markets a decisive advantage. Still, USDH’s biggest test will be “breaking through the dominance of USDC and USDT, where adoption and liquidity remain king,” Liu noted. “Transparency around reserves and strong, unified governance will be vital to win lasting trust,” with its future prospects highly dependent “on proving it can compete while maintaining stability,” he added.

Title: Proxy firm critics say they’re calling the shots in corporate America

In Focus delivers deeper coverage of the political, cultural, and ideological issues shaping America. Published daily by senior writers and experts, these in-depth pieces go beyond the headlines to give readers the full picture. You can find our full list of In Focus pieces here. Lawmakers in Washington are sounding the alarm over little-known shareholder watchdogs that they say are quietly shaping decisions at the nation’s largest companies. The two players at the center of the storm are Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis, which dominate nearly the entire proxy advisory market. Both companies play an outsize role in guiding how major institutional investors such as BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street vote on everything from executive pay and board seats to hot-button policies tied to climate policy and workplace diversity. What started as a simple “cheat sheet” for busy investors has, according to critics, morphed into a system where ISS and Glass Lewis effectively steer corporate decision-making. That influence boiled over at a heated House hearing last week, where Republicans accused the firms of acting like unelected regulators. Much of the fight centers on Rule 14a-8 of the Securities Exchange Act, which lays out the process for shareholders to put proposals on a company’s proxy ballot. Republicans say the rule has been stretched far beyond its intent, enabling activists to force votes on divisive social issues that have little to do with shareholder value. Democrats counter that 14a-8 is one of the few tools ordinary investors have to hold corporate boards accountable. Rep. French Hill (R-AK), who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, argued the firms’ influence has ballooned in recent decades, raising doubts about whether they still serve investors. “We’ve seen the shareholder proposal process diverted away from the critical business strategy focus and instead become a tool for advancing proposals to distract from companies’ missions, leading to an erosion of shareholder value and costly burdens on companies,” Hill said during the hearing on Wednesday. Other Republicans piled on, saying the proposal process has been hijacked. Rep. Marlin Stutzman (R-IN) pointed out a Cummins proposal to link executive pay to climate goals, a diversity, equity, and inclusion data-reporting resolution at Eli Lilly, and a request at Coca-Cola for a report on the risks the company faces from state abortion restrictions. Rep. Lisa McClain (R-MI) was more blunt: “Two proxy firms should not be deciding how trillions of dollars in shareholders’ votes are cast.” Shareholder activism has already left its mark on some of the country’s best-known companies. After repeated pressure from investors, Amazon agreed to conduct a racial equity audit of its workforce practices, a move overseen by an outside law firm. Tesla’s $56 billion pay package for CEO Elon Musk became another flashpoint, with both Glass Lewis and ISS urging shareholders to vote it down. Another corporate heavyweight, JPMorgan Chase, faced proposals demanding more detailed disclosures about its fossil-fuel financing, while companies such as Coca-Cola and McDonald’s have been pressed on workplace policies ranging from abortion access to gender-affirming care. Stutzman said the trend underscores how a small group of activists can use proxy firms to drive corporate agendas. “I’m a free market guy, and I believe companies need to be able to pursue their mission, not be socially directed by a small group of shareholders,” he told the Washington Examiner. “These firms are the ones that are the real financial winners, and the companies are the ones that have to navigate issues they don’t really want to deal with.” Critics warn that big asset managers can push companies into cultural fights. BlackRock, which owns nearly 15% of Cracker Barrel, often follows guidance from ISS and Glass Lewis. Last month, the chain dropped its famous “Old Timer” logo for a new look, drawing fierce backlash from customers, conservative critics, and even President Donald Trump. Within weeks, Cracker Barrel reversed course. “If they want to rebrand themselves and say, ‘This is who we are,’ fine. But customers will let them know very quickly if they don’t like it,” Stutzman said, noting that Jaguar Land Rover’s CEO faced similar criticism, stepping down after a rebrand critics derided as “woke.” Democrats countered that Republicans exaggerated the firms’ sway and misrepresented how the shareholder process works. Rep. Sean Casten (D-IL), former CEO of Turbosteam Corporation, dismissed the hearing as “really dumb” and accused Republicans of inventing a “boogeyman that doesn’t exist.” He stressed that shareholder proposals are strictly advisory, not binding, and said it was misleading to suggest proxy advisers could dictate corporate decisions. “Shareholders are actually the people who own companies … executives serve at their pleasure. They are custodians of shareholders’ investment, but they are not actually the people in charge,” Casten said. “This is not freaking complicated … the law says [shareholder proposals] are advisory. They get factored in, and then we have a high-functioning board.” New York City comptroller Brad Lander, who testified as a witness, emphasized that shareholder proposals are essential tools for accountability and long-term value. Lander, who oversees $300 billion in pension assets, pointed to past campaigns on executive pay clawbacks, insider trading, and board access that began as shareholder resolutions and later became standard practice or Securities and Exchange Commission policy. “These tools help protect the retirement security of New York City’s teachers, cops, firefighters, and nurses,” he said. “Shareholder proposals and engagement strengthen accountability and ensure that U.S. markets remain the most trusted and resilient in the world. Let’s not screw that up.” Lawmakers also raised alarms about who owns the proxy advisory giants. ISS, founded in Maryland in the 1980s, is now majority-owned by Deutsche Börse Group, the German exchange operator that runs the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. Glass Lewis was acquired in 2021 by Peloton Capital Management, a Toronto-based private equity fund. The two firms control about 97% of the U.S. proxy advisory market. Rep. Warren Davidson (R-OH) questioned why such influential players have never been reviewed by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which screens foreign takeovers for national security risks. “In a world where we’re laser-focused on foreign influence in critical sectors like tech and infrastructure, why aren’t we properly screening foreign companies that control corporate governance in our country?” he asked, warning that European or Canadian ownership could import different political priorities into U.S. boardrooms. Witnesses echoed those concerns, pointing to the influence of European-style “double materiality” standards, which consider both a company’s effect on the outside world and on shareholders, in proxy adviser recommendations. “They’re inappropriately importing European standards of investing into the standards they are then imposing in the recommendations they give to companies … applying an entirely different investment theory to U.S. companies,” said Ferrell Keel, a partner at Jones Day. Ron Mueller of Gibson Dunn added that the shareholder proposal process has become professionalized, with advisers “not just asking for information. They’re trying to influence outcomes.” The firms reject the charge that they wield unchecked power. ISS pushed back on the criticism, stressing that it does not control which proposals appear on corporate ballots or how investors ultimately vote. “Corporations and their investors … make those choices,” a spokesman said in a statement to the Washington Examiner, adding that ISS provides “rigorous, fact-based research, analysis, and recommendations” based on clients’ voting policies. The firm also noted that it is registered with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act and said a framework for regulating proxy voting advice already exists. Glass Lewis declined to comment. The debate over how to check that influence now shifts to regulators and the courts. Federal regulators have wrestled with how far to go in policing the industry. In 2020, the SEC adopted rules aimed at adding transparency and giving companies a chance to rebut proxy firm recommendations. Two years later, former SEC Chairman Gary Gensler reversed course, rolling back those measures. More recently, a federal appeals court narrowed the agency’s reach even further, ruling that proxy advice does not count as a “solicitation” under federal law, a decision that limits the commission’s ability to regulate the firms. States have tried to wade in as well. In Texas, a new law requiring proxy advisers to disclose when their recommendations relied on “non-financial factors” such as environmental, social, and governance considerations was set to take effect Sept. 1. However, on Aug. 29, a federal judge granted ISS and Glass Lewis a preliminary injunction, siding with their argument that the statute violated the First Amendment by compelling speech, among other claims. A source familiar with the agency’s thinking said legislative changes that explicitly authorize the SEC to regulate proxy advisers under the Exchange Act would be the most effective fix. SEC Chairman Paul Atkins has long been critical of proxy firms, and the source added that the commission shares lawmakers’ and industry groups’ concerns about the firms’ influence and lack of accountability. LAWMAKERS DEMAND OVERSIGHT OF PROXY GIANTS DRIVING ESG IN CORPORATE AMERICA That tug-of-war has sharpened calls in Congress for a legislative fix, especially after recent court decisions. Rep. Bryan Steil (R-WI) told the committee he has repeatedly introduced bills to rein in what he called the “duopoly” of ISS and Glass Lewis, arguing both firms should be held to stricter disclosure standards. Rep. Ann Wagner (R-MO) promoted her Corporate Governance Examination Act, which would require the SEC to study the proxy process regularly to guard against what she described as “unnecessary politicization.” But Lander cautioned that rolling back shareholder rights would backfire. He noted that past proposals helped drive reforms later codified by the SEC. New limits, he warned, could “gut” accountability tools that protect long-term investor value.

Title: Bank of America to create up to 1,000 new jobs in Belfast | The Irish Post

UP to 1,000 jobs are set to be created in Belfast by Bank of America, the world's second-largest bank. American multinational Citigroup is also set to grow its presence in Northern Ireland, where the bank currently employs several thousand people. The plans were announced yesterday by Britain's Department for Business and Trade (DBT) as part of a £1.25bn investment into the financial services sector by a raft of leading US firms, which also includes BlackRock, PayPal and S&P Global. As well as Belfast, some of the companies are set to expand operations and open new offices all across Britain, with London, Edinburgh and Manchester set to gain from a wave of skilled job creation. "These investments will create thousands of high-skilled jobs from Belfast to Edinburgh, kickstarting the growth that is essential to putting money in working people's pockets across every part of the United Kingdom," said Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves. The news of Bank of America's investment marks the company's first-ever operation in Northern Ireland, a major milestone that underscores the region's growing role in global financial services. Brian Moynihan, Chair and CEO of the company, said: "At Bank of America we are focused on helping our clients advance economic opportunity and prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic. "The early US-UK trade agreement that the President and the Prime Minister began discussing in February has provided the business community with the certainty and framework it needs to strengthen transatlantic commerce. "We are pleased to be able to extend Bank of America's investment in the UK with the creation of a new Belfast operations facility to support our global business, bringing up to 1,000 new opportunities to Northern Ireland." Citigroup are investing £1.1bn into Britain, its second-largest market globally. It employs 14,000 people across Britain working across four main sites — London, Belfast, Edinburgh and Jersey. Citibank, the group's primary subsidiary, has invested heavily in the refurbishment of its Canary Wharf headquarters and continues to invest in its Northern Ireland operations. The bank is already one of the top employers in Belfast, now employing more than 4,000 people there, firmly establishing the city as a major technology powerhouse. "Citi's commitment to the UK runs deep," said Jane Fraser, Citi Group CEO. "This is home to many of our most senior leaders and nearly 14,000 colleagues across London, Belfast, Edinburgh and Jersey. "We're proud to be serving 85 per cent of the FTSE 100 and to have stood beside UK companies through every market cycle, raising capital, financing growth and helping them compete on the world stage.

Title: Why We Need the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act: A Legal Shield Against the Censorship Industrial Complex

The First Amendment was designed to protect all speechâespecially unpopular speechâfrom government tyranny. Yet today, Google, Facebook, Twitter (X), YouTube, Wikipedia, corporate media, and universities operate as de facto arms of the government, colluding with the DHS, DoD, CIA, and foreign NGOs to blacklist, deplatform, and economically destroy anyone who challenges the official narrative. This is not hyperbole. Smoking-gun documents from lawsuits like Missouri v. Biden and Brighteon v. Google (et al) prove that the U.S. government has been laundering censorship requests through overseas NGOs to bypass constitutional protections. People like myself, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Tucker Carlson, Alex Jones, and now Charlie Kirkâall have been systematically erased from digital public squares simply for expressing views that contradict the pharmaceutical-industrial complex, the climate cult, the LGBTQ indoctrination agenda, or the military-industrial war machine. Enough is enough. It is time for Congress to pass the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Actâa landmark law that would: - Outlaw viewpoint discrimination on all large platforms (1M+ users). - Fine violators $1 billion per day for algorithmic or manual censorship of protected speech. - Explicitly protect political, medical, scientific, religious, and anti-government speech. - Establish a $1 trillion compensation fund for victims of censorship over the past decade. - Criminally prosecute executives who engage in systematic suppression of free expression. This is not about restricting speechâit is about restoring it. The First Amendment was never meant to protect corporate oligarchs who act as state-enforced thought police. If a platform functions as the modern public square, it must uphold public square rules: no censorship of lawful speech. The Censorship Industrial Complex: How We Got Here 1. The Government-Big Tech Nexus: A Decade of Collusion The 2016 election marked the beginning of open censorship warfare. After Donald Trumpâs victory, the Deep State panickedâand Big Tech became its enforcer. - 2017: Googleâs "Project Veritas" leaks revealed that the company was manipulating search results to bury conservative content. - 2018: Twitter shadowbanned prominent Republicans, including Devin Nunes and Charlie Kirk. - 2020: The Hunter Biden laptop story was suppressed by 51 intelligence officials (later proven to be CIA/FBI disinformation) in collusion with Twitter, Facebook, and Google. - 2021: The Biden White House openly admitted to flagging "misinformation" to Facebook for removal. - 2022: Missouri v. Biden exposed weekly meetings between the DHS, FBI, CDC, and Big Tech to coordinate censorship. - 2024: Brighteonâs lawsuit uncovered direct orders from the DoD to Google and NewsGuard to blacklist independent media. - 2025: Charlie Kirk was shotâafter years of being deplatformed, demonetized, and slandered by the same institutions that now celebrate his silencing. 2. The Mechanics of Censorship Laundering To bypass the First Amendment, the government outsources censorship to: - Foreign NGOs (e.g., Global Disinformation Index, Institute for Strategic Dialogue) - "Fact-checkers" (e.g., NewsGuard, PolitiFact)âfunded by the State Department and Big Pharma - AI-driven suppression (e.g., Googleâs "disinformation" filters, Facebookâs "community standards") - Payment processors (e.g., PayPal, Stripe banning dissident accounts) Example: If the CDC wants to silence vaccine criticism, it doesnât directly order Facebook to ban accountsâit funds a UK-based NGO (like the Global Disinformation Index), which then flags "anti-vax" content for removal. Facebook complies, claiming itâs just following "independent fact-checkers." This is money laundering for censorship. 3. The Human Cost: Ruined Lives, Stifled Debate, and Violence Censorship doesnât just suppress ideasâit destroys lives. - Mike Adams (Health Ranger): Banned from YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Google search for questioning COVID vaccines and advocating natural medicine. The reach of my businesses dropped 99% due to debanking and demonetization. - Robert F. Kennedy Jr.: Shadowbanned on Instagram, censored on YouTube, and smeared as a "conspiracy theorist" for criticizing Anthony Fauci and Big Pharma. - Tucker Carlson: Fired from Fox News after exposing the Ukraine biolabs story, then censored on X (Twitter) despite Elon Muskâs "free speech" promises. - Charlie Kirk: Banned from college campuses, demonetized on YouTube, and ultimately shotâafter years of being labeled an "extremist" by the SPLC and ADL. When lawful speech is criminalized, violence becomes inevitable. The shooting of Charlie Kirk is the direct result of a culture that treats conservative viewpoints as "dangerous" and seeks to silence them by any means possible. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act: Restoring the First Amendment 1. Defining "Large Platforms" (The New Public Square) Any entity with 1 million+ users/readers that functions as a digital public forum must adhere to First Amendment protections. This includes: - Social media (Facebook, X/Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube) - Search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) - Media outlets (CNN, NYT, WaPo, Fox News) - Universities (Harvard, Stanford, UC Berkeley) - Payment processors (PayPal, Stripe, Venmo) - Wikipedia & "Fact-Checkers" (PolitiFact, Snopes, NewsGuard) Exception: Small, niche platforms (e.g., a private Christian forum or a local hobbyist message board) would not be subject to these rules. 2. Absolute Ban on Viewpoint Discrimination The law would explicitly protect the following categories of speech: - Political speech (pro-Trump, anti-Biden, socialist, libertarianâall views) - Medical & scientific speech (vaccine criticism, natural cures, COVID origins, bioweapons discussions, psychiatric drugs) - Religious speech (Christian, Muslim, Jewish, atheistâno blasphemy bans) - Anti-government speech (criticism of the FBI, CIA, WHO, WEF, etc.) - Economic & financial speech (Bitcoin, gold, criticism of the Federal Reserve) - Historical & cultural speech (debates on slavery, WWII, 9/11, JFK assassination) Whatâs NOT protected? ? Direct incitement to violence ("Go kill [person] at [location]") ? True threats ("Iâm going to bomb [place]") ? Child pornography & exploitation ? Doxxing & harassment (releasing private info to encourage stalking) 3. $1 Billion Per Day Fines for Censorship Violations Algorithmic suppression? $1B/day. Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day. Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh? Because only existential financial consequences will force these monopolistic corporations to stop acting as government enforcers. 4. The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America. God bless free speech. ### Follow my podcasts, interviews, articles and social media posts on: Twitter:Â https://twitter.com/HealthRanger Brighteon.social:Â Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger Brighteon.io:Â Brighteon.io/healthranger Telegram:Â t.me/RealHealthRanger Brighteon.com:Â Brighteon.com/channels/HRreport Rumble:Â Rumble.com/c/HealthRangerReport Substack:Â HealthRanger.substack.com Banned.video:Â Banned.video/channel/mike-adams Bastyon:Â https://bastyon.com/healthranger Gettr:Â GETTR.com/user/healthranger BitChute:Â Bitchute.com/channel/9EB8glubb0Ns/ Clouthub:Â app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/naturalnews/posts My music with MP3 downloads and music videos:Â music.Brighteon.com Watch my 100+ interviews on decentralization and freedom at Decentralize.TV Join the freeÂ NaturalNews.com email newsletterÂ to stay alerted about breaking news each day.

The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America. God bless free speech. ### Follow my podcasts, interviews, articles and social media posts on: Twitter:Â https://twitter.com/HealthRanger Brighteon.social:Â Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger Brighteon.io:Â Brighteon.io/healthranger Telegram:Â t.me/RealHealthRanger Brighteon.com:Â Brighteon.com/channels/HRreport Rumble:Â Rumble.com/c/HealthRangerReport Substack:Â HealthRanger.substack.com Banned.video:Â Banned.video/channel/mike-adams Bastyon:Â https://bastyon.com/healthranger Gettr:Â GETTR.com/user/healthranger BitChute:Â Bitchute.com/channel/9EB8glubb0Ns/ Clouthub:Â app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/naturalnews/posts My music with MP3 downloads and music videos:Â music.Brighteon.com Watch my 100+ interviews on decentralization and freedom at Decentralize.TV Join the freeÂ NaturalNews.com email newsletterÂ to stay alerted about breaking news each day.

This is not hyperbole. Smoking-gun documents from lawsuits like Missouri v. Biden and Brighteon v. Google (et al) prove that the U.S. government has been laundering censorship requests through overseas NGOs to bypass constitutional protections. People like myself, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Tucker Carlson, Alex Jones, and now Charlie Kirkâall have been systematically erased from digital public squares simply for expressing views that contradict the pharmaceutical-industrial complex, the climate cult, the LGBTQ indoctrination agenda, or the military-industrial war machine. Enough is enough. It is time for Congress to pass the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Actâa landmark law that would: - Outlaw viewpoint discrimination on all large platforms (1M+ users). - Fine violators $1 billion per day for algorithmic or manual censorship of protected speech. - Explicitly protect political, medical, scientific, religious, and anti-government speech. - Establish a $1 trillion compensation fund for victims of censorship over the past decade. - Criminally prosecute executives who engage in systematic suppression of free expression. This is not about restricting speechâit is about restoring it. The First Amendment was never meant to protect corporate oligarchs who act as state-enforced thought police. If a platform functions as the modern public square, it must uphold public square rules: no censorship of lawful speech. The Censorship Industrial Complex: How We Got Here 1. The Government-Big Tech Nexus: A Decade of Collusion The 2016 election marked the beginning of open censorship warfare. After Donald Trumpâs victory, the Deep State panickedâand Big Tech became its enforcer. - 2017: Googleâs "Project Veritas" leaks revealed that the company was manipulating search results to bury conservative content. - 2018: Twitter shadowbanned prominent Republicans, including Devin Nunes and Charlie Kirk. - 2020: The Hunter Biden laptop story was suppressed by 51 intelligence officials (later proven to be CIA/FBI disinformation) in collusion with Twitter, Facebook, and Google. - 2021: The Biden White House openly admitted to flagging "misinformation" to Facebook for removal. - 2022: Missouri v. Biden exposed weekly meetings between the DHS, FBI, CDC, and Big Tech to coordinate censorship. - 2024: Brighteonâs lawsuit uncovered direct orders from the DoD to Google and NewsGuard to blacklist independent media. - 2025: Charlie Kirk was shotâafter years of being deplatformed, demonetized, and slandered by the same institutions that now celebrate his silencing. 2. The Mechanics of Censorship Laundering To bypass the First Amendment, the government outsources censorship to: - Foreign NGOs (e.g., Global Disinformation Index, Institute for Strategic Dialogue) - "Fact-checkers" (e.g., NewsGuard, PolitiFact)âfunded by the State Department and Big Pharma - AI-driven suppression (e.g., Googleâs "disinformation" filters, Facebookâs "community standards") - Payment processors (e.g., PayPal, Stripe banning dissident accounts) Example: If the CDC wants to silence vaccine criticism, it doesnât directly order Facebook to ban accountsâit funds a UK-based NGO (like the Global Disinformation Index), which then flags "anti-vax" content for removal. Facebook complies, claiming itâs just following "independent fact-checkers." This is money laundering for censorship. 3. The Human Cost: Ruined Lives, Stifled Debate, and Violence Censorship doesnât just suppress ideasâit destroys lives. - Mike Adams (Health Ranger): Banned from YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Google search for questioning COVID vaccines and advocating natural medicine. The reach of my businesses dropped 99% due to debanking and demonetization. - Robert F. Kennedy Jr.: Shadowbanned on Instagram, censored on YouTube, and smeared as a "conspiracy theorist" for criticizing Anthony Fauci and Big Pharma. - Tucker Carlson: Fired from Fox News after exposing the Ukraine biolabs story, then censored on X (Twitter) despite Elon Muskâs "free speech" promises. - Charlie Kirk: Banned from college campuses, demonetized on YouTube, and ultimately shotâafter years of being labeled an "extremist" by the SPLC and ADL. When lawful speech is criminalized, violence becomes inevitable. The shooting of Charlie Kirk is the direct result of a culture that treats conservative viewpoints as "dangerous" and seeks to silence them by any means possible. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act: Restoring the First Amendment 1. Defining "Large Platforms" (The New Public Square) Any entity with 1 million+ users/readers that functions as a digital public forum must adhere to First Amendment protections. This includes: - Social media (Facebook, X/Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube) - Search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) - Media outlets (CNN, NYT, WaPo, Fox News) - Universities (Harvard, Stanford, UC Berkeley) - Payment processors (PayPal, Stripe, Venmo) - Wikipedia & "Fact-Checkers" (PolitiFact, Snopes, NewsGuard) Exception: Small, niche platforms (e.g., a private Christian forum or a local hobbyist message board) would not be subject to these rules. 2. Absolute Ban on Viewpoint Discrimination The law would explicitly protect the following categories of speech: - Political speech (pro-Trump, anti-Biden, socialist, libertarianâall views) - Medical & scientific speech (vaccine criticism, natural cures, COVID origins, bioweapons discussions, psychiatric drugs) - Religious speech (Christian, Muslim, Jewish, atheistâno blasphemy bans) - Anti-government speech (criticism of the FBI, CIA, WHO, WEF, etc.) - Economic & financial speech (Bitcoin, gold, criticism of the Federal Reserve) - Historical & cultural speech (debates on slavery, WWII, 9/11, JFK assassination) Whatâs NOT protected? ? Direct incitement to violence ("Go kill [person] at [location]") ? True threats ("Iâm going to bomb [place]") ? Child pornography & exploitation ? Doxxing & harassment (releasing private info to encourage stalking) 3. $1 Billion Per Day Fines for Censorship Violations Algorithmic suppression? $1B/day. Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day. Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh? Because only existential financial consequences will force these monopolistic corporations to stop acting as government enforcers. 4. The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors.

Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America. God bless free speech. ### Follow my podcasts, interviews, articles and social media posts on: Twitter:Â https://twitter.com/HealthRanger Brighteon.social:Â Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger Brighteon.io:Â Brighteon.io/healthranger Telegram:Â t.me/RealHealthRanger Brighteon.com:Â Brighteon.com/channels/HRreport Rumble:Â Rumble.com/c/HealthRangerReport Substack:Â HealthRanger.substack.com Banned.video:Â Banned.video/channel/mike-adams Bastyon:Â https://bastyon.com/healthranger Gettr:Â GETTR.com/user/healthranger BitChute:Â Bitchute.com/channel/9EB8glubb0Ns/ Clouthub:Â app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/naturalnews/posts My music with MP3 downloads and music videos:Â music.Brighteon.com Watch my 100+ interviews on decentralization and freedom at Decentralize.TV Join the freeÂ NaturalNews.com email newsletterÂ to stay alerted about breaking news each day.

It is time for Congress to pass the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Actâa landmark law that would: - Outlaw viewpoint discrimination on all large platforms (1M+ users). - Fine violators $1 billion per day for algorithmic or manual censorship of protected speech. - Explicitly protect political, medical, scientific, religious, and anti-government speech. - Establish a $1 trillion compensation fund for victims of censorship over the past decade. - Criminally prosecute executives who engage in systematic suppression of free expression. This is not about restricting speechâit is about restoring it. The First Amendment was never meant to protect corporate oligarchs who act as state-enforced thought police. If a platform functions as the modern public square, it must uphold public square rules: no censorship of lawful speech. The Censorship Industrial Complex: How We Got Here 1. The Government-Big Tech Nexus: A Decade of Collusion The 2016 election marked the beginning of open censorship warfare. After Donald Trumpâs victory, the Deep State panickedâand Big Tech became its enforcer. - 2017: Googleâs "Project Veritas" leaks revealed that the company was manipulating search results to bury conservative content. - 2018: Twitter shadowbanned prominent Republicans, including Devin Nunes and Charlie Kirk. - 2020: The Hunter Biden laptop story was suppressed by 51 intelligence officials (later proven to be CIA/FBI disinformation) in collusion with Twitter, Facebook, and Google. - 2021: The Biden White House openly admitted to flagging "misinformation" to Facebook for removal. - 2022: Missouri v. Biden exposed weekly meetings between the DHS, FBI, CDC, and Big Tech to coordinate censorship. - 2024: Brighteonâs lawsuit uncovered direct orders from the DoD to Google and NewsGuard to blacklist independent media. - 2025: Charlie Kirk was shotâafter years of being deplatformed, demonetized, and slandered by the same institutions that now celebrate his silencing. 2. The Mechanics of Censorship Laundering To bypass the First Amendment, the government outsources censorship to: - Foreign NGOs (e.g., Global Disinformation Index, Institute for Strategic Dialogue) - "Fact-checkers" (e.g., NewsGuard, PolitiFact)âfunded by the State Department and Big Pharma - AI-driven suppression (e.g., Googleâs "disinformation" filters, Facebookâs "community standards") - Payment processors (e.g., PayPal, Stripe banning dissident accounts) Example: If the CDC wants to silence vaccine criticism, it doesnât directly order Facebook to ban accountsâit funds a UK-based NGO (like the Global Disinformation Index), which then flags "anti-vax" content for removal. Facebook complies, claiming itâs just following "independent fact-checkers." This is money laundering for censorship. 3. The Human Cost: Ruined Lives, Stifled Debate, and Violence Censorship doesnât just suppress ideasâit destroys lives. - Mike Adams (Health Ranger): Banned from YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Google search for questioning COVID vaccines and advocating natural medicine. The reach of my businesses dropped 99% due to debanking and demonetization. - Robert F. Kennedy Jr.: Shadowbanned on Instagram, censored on YouTube, and smeared as a "conspiracy theorist" for criticizing Anthony Fauci and Big Pharma. - Tucker Carlson: Fired from Fox News after exposing the Ukraine biolabs story, then censored on X (Twitter) despite Elon Muskâs "free speech" promises. - Charlie Kirk: Banned from college campuses, demonetized on YouTube, and ultimately shotâafter years of being labeled an "extremist" by the SPLC and ADL. When lawful speech is criminalized, violence becomes inevitable. The shooting of Charlie Kirk is the direct result of a culture that treats conservative viewpoints as "dangerous" and seeks to silence them by any means possible. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act: Restoring the First Amendment 1. Defining "Large Platforms" (The New Public Square) Any entity with 1 million+ users/readers that functions as a digital public forum must adhere to First Amendment protections. This includes: - Social media (Facebook, X/Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube) - Search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) - Media outlets (CNN, NYT, WaPo, Fox News) - Universities (Harvard, Stanford, UC Berkeley) - Payment processors (PayPal, Stripe, Venmo) - Wikipedia & "Fact-Checkers" (PolitiFact, Snopes, NewsGuard) Exception: Small, niche platforms (e.g., a private Christian forum or a local hobbyist message board) would not be subject to these rules. 2. Absolute Ban on Viewpoint Discrimination The law would explicitly protect the following categories of speech: - Political speech (pro-Trump, anti-Biden, socialist, libertarianâall views) - Medical & scientific speech (vaccine criticism, natural cures, COVID origins, bioweapons discussions, psychiatric drugs) - Religious speech (Christian, Muslim, Jewish, atheistâno blasphemy bans) - Anti-government speech (criticism of the FBI, CIA, WHO, WEF, etc.) - Economic & financial speech (Bitcoin, gold, criticism of the Federal Reserve) - Historical & cultural speech (debates on slavery, WWII, 9/11, JFK assassination) Whatâs NOT protected? ? Direct incitement to violence ("Go kill [person] at [location]") ? True threats ("Iâm going to bomb [place]") ? Child pornography & exploitation ? Doxxing & harassment (releasing private info to encourage stalking) 3. $1 Billion Per Day Fines for Censorship Violations Algorithmic suppression? $1B/day. Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day. Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh? Because only existential financial consequences will force these monopolistic corporations to stop acting as government enforcers. 4.

The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America. God bless free speech. ### Follow my podcasts, interviews, articles and social media posts on: Twitter:Â https://twitter.com/HealthRanger Brighteon.social:Â Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger Brighteon.io:Â Brighteon.io/healthranger Telegram:Â t.me/RealHealthRanger Brighteon.com:Â Brighteon.com/channels/HRreport Rumble:Â Rumble.com/c/HealthRangerReport Substack:Â HealthRanger.substack.com Banned.video:Â Banned.video/channel/mike-adams Bastyon:Â https://bastyon.com/healthranger Gettr:Â GETTR.com/user/healthranger BitChute:Â Bitchute.com/channel/9EB8glubb0Ns/ Clouthub:Â app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/naturalnews/posts My music with MP3 downloads and music videos:Â music.Brighteon.com Watch my 100+ interviews on decentralization and freedom at Decentralize.TV Join the freeÂ NaturalNews.com email newsletterÂ to stay alerted about breaking news each day.

This is not about restricting speechâit is about restoring it. The First Amendment was never meant to protect corporate oligarchs who act as state-enforced thought police. If a platform functions as the modern public square, it must uphold public square rules: no censorship of lawful speech. The Censorship Industrial Complex: How We Got Here 1. The Government-Big Tech Nexus: A Decade of Collusion The 2016 election marked the beginning of open censorship warfare. After Donald Trumpâs victory, the Deep State panickedâand Big Tech became its enforcer. - 2017: Googleâs "Project Veritas" leaks revealed that the company was manipulating search results to bury conservative content. - 2018: Twitter shadowbanned prominent Republicans, including Devin Nunes and Charlie Kirk. - 2020: The Hunter Biden laptop story was suppressed by 51 intelligence officials (later proven to be CIA/FBI disinformation) in collusion with Twitter, Facebook, and Google. - 2021: The Biden White House openly admitted to flagging "misinformation" to Facebook for removal. - 2022: Missouri v. Biden exposed weekly meetings between the DHS, FBI, CDC, and Big Tech to coordinate censorship. - 2024: Brighteonâs lawsuit uncovered direct orders from the DoD to Google and NewsGuard to blacklist independent media. - 2025: Charlie Kirk was shotâafter years of being deplatformed, demonetized, and slandered by the same institutions that now celebrate his silencing. 2. The Mechanics of Censorship Laundering To bypass the First Amendment, the government outsources censorship to: - Foreign NGOs (e.g., Global Disinformation Index, Institute for Strategic Dialogue) - "Fact-checkers" (e.g., NewsGuard, PolitiFact)âfunded by the State Department and Big Pharma - AI-driven suppression (e.g., Googleâs "disinformation" filters, Facebookâs "community standards") - Payment processors (e.g., PayPal, Stripe banning dissident accounts) Example: If the CDC wants to silence vaccine criticism, it doesnât directly order Facebook to ban accountsâit funds a UK-based NGO (like the Global Disinformation Index), which then flags "anti-vax" content for removal. Facebook complies, claiming itâs just following "independent fact-checkers." This is money laundering for censorship. 3. The Human Cost: Ruined Lives, Stifled Debate, and Violence Censorship doesnât just suppress ideasâit destroys lives. - Mike Adams (Health Ranger): Banned from YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Google search for questioning COVID vaccines and advocating natural medicine. The reach of my businesses dropped 99% due to debanking and demonetization. - Robert F. Kennedy Jr.: Shadowbanned on Instagram, censored on YouTube, and smeared as a "conspiracy theorist" for criticizing Anthony Fauci and Big Pharma. - Tucker Carlson: Fired from Fox News after exposing the Ukraine biolabs story, then censored on X (Twitter) despite Elon Muskâs "free speech" promises. - Charlie Kirk: Banned from college campuses, demonetized on YouTube, and ultimately shotâafter years of being labeled an "extremist" by the SPLC and ADL. When lawful speech is criminalized, violence becomes inevitable. The shooting of Charlie Kirk is the direct result of a culture that treats conservative viewpoints as "dangerous" and seeks to silence them by any means possible. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act: Restoring the First Amendment 1. Defining "Large Platforms" (The New Public Square) Any entity with 1 million+ users/readers that functions as a digital public forum must adhere to First Amendment protections. This includes: - Social media (Facebook, X/Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube) - Search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) - Media outlets (CNN, NYT, WaPo, Fox News) - Universities (Harvard, Stanford, UC Berkeley) - Payment processors (PayPal, Stripe, Venmo) - Wikipedia & "Fact-Checkers" (PolitiFact, Snopes, NewsGuard) Exception: Small, niche platforms (e.g., a private Christian forum or a local hobbyist message board) would not be subject to these rules. 2. Absolute Ban on Viewpoint Discrimination The law would explicitly protect the following categories of speech: - Political speech (pro-Trump, anti-Biden, socialist, libertarianâall views) - Medical & scientific speech (vaccine criticism, natural cures, COVID origins, bioweapons discussions, psychiatric drugs) - Religious speech (Christian, Muslim, Jewish, atheistâno blasphemy bans) - Anti-government speech (criticism of the FBI, CIA, WHO, WEF, etc.) - Economic & financial speech (Bitcoin, gold, criticism of the Federal Reserve) - Historical & cultural speech (debates on slavery, WWII, 9/11, JFK assassination) Whatâs NOT protected? ? Direct incitement to violence ("Go kill [person] at [location]") ? True threats ("Iâm going to bomb [place]") ? Child pornography & exploitation ? Doxxing & harassment (releasing private info to encourage stalking) 3. $1 Billion Per Day Fines for Censorship Violations Algorithmic suppression? $1B/day. Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day. Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh?

Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America. God bless free speech. ### Follow my podcasts, interviews, articles and social media posts on: Twitter:Â https://twitter.com/HealthRanger Brighteon.social:Â Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger Brighteon.io:Â Brighteon.io/healthranger Telegram:Â t.me/RealHealthRanger Brighteon.com:Â Brighteon.com/channels/HRreport Rumble:Â Rumble.com/c/HealthRangerReport Substack:Â HealthRanger.substack.com Banned.video:Â Banned.video/channel/mike-adams Bastyon:Â https://bastyon.com/healthranger Gettr:Â GETTR.com/user/healthranger BitChute:Â Bitchute.com/channel/9EB8glubb0Ns/ Clouthub:Â app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/naturalnews/posts My music with MP3 downloads and music videos:Â music.Brighteon.com Watch my 100+ interviews on decentralization and freedom at Decentralize.TV Join the freeÂ NaturalNews.com email newsletterÂ to stay alerted about breaking news each day.

This is not about restricting speechâit is about restoring it. The First Amendment was never meant to protect corporate oligarchs who act as state-enforced thought police. If a platform functions as the modern public square, it must uphold public square rules: no censorship of lawful speech. The Censorship Industrial Complex: How We Got Here 1. The Government-Big Tech Nexus: A Decade of Collusion The 2016 election marked the beginning of open censorship warfare. After Donald Trumpâs victory, the Deep State panickedâand Big Tech became its enforcer. - 2017: Googleâs "Project Veritas" leaks revealed that the company was manipulating search results to bury conservative content. - 2018: Twitter shadowbanned prominent Republicans, including Devin Nunes and Charlie Kirk. - 2020: The Hunter Biden laptop story was suppressed by 51 intelligence officials (later proven to be CIA/FBI disinformation) in collusion with Twitter, Facebook, and Google. - 2021: The Biden White House openly admitted to flagging "misinformation" to Facebook for removal. - 2022: Missouri v. Biden exposed weekly meetings between the DHS, FBI, CDC, and Big Tech to coordinate censorship. - 2024: Brighteonâs lawsuit uncovered direct orders from the DoD to Google and NewsGuard to blacklist independent media. - 2025: Charlie Kirk was shotâafter years of being deplatformed, demonetized, and slandered by the same institutions that now celebrate his silencing. 2. The Mechanics of Censorship Laundering To bypass the First Amendment, the government outsources censorship to: - Foreign NGOs (e.g., Global Disinformation Index, Institute for Strategic Dialogue) - "Fact-checkers" (e.g., NewsGuard, PolitiFact)âfunded by the State Department and Big Pharma - AI-driven suppression (e.g., Googleâs "disinformation" filters, Facebookâs "community standards") - Payment processors (e.g., PayPal, Stripe banning dissident accounts) Example: If the CDC wants to silence vaccine criticism, it doesnât directly order Facebook to ban accountsâit funds a UK-based NGO (like the Global Disinformation Index), which then flags "anti-vax" content for removal. Facebook complies, claiming itâs just following "independent fact-checkers." This is money laundering for censorship. 3. The Human Cost: Ruined Lives, Stifled Debate, and Violence Censorship doesnât just suppress ideasâit destroys lives. - Mike Adams (Health Ranger): Banned from YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Google search for questioning COVID vaccines and advocating natural medicine. The reach of my businesses dropped 99% due to debanking and demonetization. - Robert F. Kennedy Jr.: Shadowbanned on Instagram, censored on YouTube, and smeared as a "conspiracy theorist" for criticizing Anthony Fauci and Big Pharma. - Tucker Carlson: Fired from Fox News after exposing the Ukraine biolabs story, then censored on X (Twitter) despite Elon Muskâs "free speech" promises. - Charlie Kirk: Banned from college campuses, demonetized on YouTube, and ultimately shotâafter years of being labeled an "extremist" by the SPLC and ADL. When lawful speech is criminalized, violence becomes inevitable. The shooting of Charlie Kirk is the direct result of a culture that treats conservative viewpoints as "dangerous" and seeks to silence them by any means possible. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act: Restoring the First Amendment 1. Defining "Large Platforms" (The New Public Square) Any entity with 1 million+ users/readers that functions as a digital public forum must adhere to First Amendment protections. This includes: - Social media (Facebook, X/Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube) - Search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) - Media outlets (CNN, NYT, WaPo, Fox News) - Universities (Harvard, Stanford, UC Berkeley) - Payment processors (PayPal, Stripe, Venmo) - Wikipedia & "Fact-Checkers" (PolitiFact, Snopes, NewsGuard) Exception: Small, niche platforms (e.g., a private Christian forum or a local hobbyist message board) would not be subject to these rules. 2. Absolute Ban on Viewpoint Discrimination The law would explicitly protect the following categories of speech: - Political speech (pro-Trump, anti-Biden, socialist, libertarianâall views) - Medical & scientific speech (vaccine criticism, natural cures, COVID origins, bioweapons discussions, psychiatric drugs) - Religious speech (Christian, Muslim, Jewish, atheistâno blasphemy bans) - Anti-government speech (criticism of the FBI, CIA, WHO, WEF, etc.) - Economic & financial speech (Bitcoin, gold, criticism of the Federal Reserve) - Historical & cultural speech (debates on slavery, WWII, 9/11, JFK assassination) Whatâs NOT protected? ? Direct incitement to violence ("Go kill [person] at [location]") ? True threats ("Iâm going to bomb [place]") ? Child pornography & exploitation ? Doxxing & harassment (releasing private info to encourage stalking) 3. $1 Billion Per Day Fines for Censorship Violations Algorithmic suppression? $1B/day. Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day. Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh? Because only existential financial consequences will force these monopolistic corporations to stop acting as government enforcers. 4. The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5.

If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America. God bless free speech. ### Follow my podcasts, interviews, articles and social media posts on: Twitter:Â https://twitter.com/HealthRanger Brighteon.social:Â Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger Brighteon.io:Â Brighteon.io/healthranger Telegram:Â t.me/RealHealthRanger Brighteon.com:Â Brighteon.com/channels/HRreport Rumble:Â Rumble.com/c/HealthRangerReport Substack:Â HealthRanger.substack.com Banned.video:Â Banned.video/channel/mike-adams Bastyon:Â https://bastyon.com/healthranger Gettr:Â GETTR.com/user/healthranger BitChute:Â Bitchute.com/channel/9EB8glubb0Ns/ Clouthub:Â app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/naturalnews/posts My music with MP3 downloads and music videos:Â music.Brighteon.com Watch my 100+ interviews on decentralization and freedom at Decentralize.TV Join the freeÂ NaturalNews.com email newsletterÂ to stay alerted about breaking news each day.

This is not about restricting speechâit is about restoring it. The First Amendment was never meant to protect corporate oligarchs who act as state-enforced thought police. If a platform functions as the modern public square, it must uphold public square rules: no censorship of lawful speech. The Censorship Industrial Complex: How We Got Here 1. The Government-Big Tech Nexus: A Decade of Collusion The 2016 election marked the beginning of open censorship warfare. After Donald Trumpâs victory, the Deep State panickedâand Big Tech became its enforcer. - 2017: Googleâs "Project Veritas" leaks revealed that the company was manipulating search results to bury conservative content. - 2018: Twitter shadowbanned prominent Republicans, including Devin Nunes and Charlie Kirk. - 2020: The Hunter Biden laptop story was suppressed by 51 intelligence officials (later proven to be CIA/FBI disinformation) in collusion with Twitter, Facebook, and Google. - 2021: The Biden White House openly admitted to flagging "misinformation" to Facebook for removal. - 2022: Missouri v. Biden exposed weekly meetings between the DHS, FBI, CDC, and Big Tech to coordinate censorship. - 2024: Brighteonâs lawsuit uncovered direct orders from the DoD to Google and NewsGuard to blacklist independent media. - 2025: Charlie Kirk was shotâafter years of being deplatformed, demonetized, and slandered by the same institutions that now celebrate his silencing. 2. The Mechanics of Censorship Laundering To bypass the First Amendment, the government outsources censorship to: - Foreign NGOs (e.g., Global Disinformation Index, Institute for Strategic Dialogue) - "Fact-checkers" (e.g., NewsGuard, PolitiFact)âfunded by the State Department and Big Pharma - AI-driven suppression (e.g., Googleâs "disinformation" filters, Facebookâs "community standards") - Payment processors (e.g., PayPal, Stripe banning dissident accounts) Example: If the CDC wants to silence vaccine criticism, it doesnât directly order Facebook to ban accountsâit funds a UK-based NGO (like the Global Disinformation Index), which then flags "anti-vax" content for removal. Facebook complies, claiming itâs just following "independent fact-checkers." This is money laundering for censorship. 3. The Human Cost: Ruined Lives, Stifled Debate, and Violence Censorship doesnât just suppress ideasâit destroys lives. - Mike Adams (Health Ranger): Banned from YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Google search for questioning COVID vaccines and advocating natural medicine. The reach of my businesses dropped 99% due to debanking and demonetization. - Robert F. Kennedy Jr.: Shadowbanned on Instagram, censored on YouTube, and smeared as a "conspiracy theorist" for criticizing Anthony Fauci and Big Pharma. - Tucker Carlson: Fired from Fox News after exposing the Ukraine biolabs story, then censored on X (Twitter) despite Elon Muskâs "free speech" promises. - Charlie Kirk: Banned from college campuses, demonetized on YouTube, and ultimately shotâafter years of being labeled an "extremist" by the SPLC and ADL. When lawful speech is criminalized, violence becomes inevitable. The shooting of Charlie Kirk is the direct result of a culture that treats conservative viewpoints as "dangerous" and seeks to silence them by any means possible. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act: Restoring the First Amendment 1. Defining "Large Platforms" (The New Public Square) Any entity with 1 million+ users/readers that functions as a digital public forum must adhere to First Amendment protections. This includes: - Social media (Facebook, X/Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube) - Search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) - Media outlets (CNN, NYT, WaPo, Fox News) - Universities (Harvard, Stanford, UC Berkeley) - Payment processors (PayPal, Stripe, Venmo) - Wikipedia & "Fact-Checkers" (PolitiFact, Snopes, NewsGuard) Exception: Small, niche platforms (e.g., a private Christian forum or a local hobbyist message board) would not be subject to these rules. 2. Absolute Ban on Viewpoint Discrimination The law would explicitly protect the following categories of speech: - Political speech (pro-Trump, anti-Biden, socialist, libertarianâall views) - Medical & scientific speech (vaccine criticism, natural cures, COVID origins, bioweapons discussions, psychiatric drugs) - Religious speech (Christian, Muslim, Jewish, atheistâno blasphemy bans) - Anti-government speech (criticism of the FBI, CIA, WHO, WEF, etc.) - Economic & financial speech (Bitcoin, gold, criticism of the Federal Reserve) - Historical & cultural speech (debates on slavery, WWII, 9/11, JFK assassination) Whatâs NOT protected? ? Direct incitement to violence ("Go kill [person] at [location]") ? True threats ("Iâm going to bomb [place]") ? Child pornography & exploitation ? Doxxing & harassment (releasing private info to encourage stalking) 3. $1 Billion Per Day Fines for Censorship Violations Algorithmic suppression? $1B/day. Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day. Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh? Because only existential financial consequences will force these monopolistic corporations to stop acting as government enforcers. 4. The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time.

Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America. God bless free speech. ### Follow my podcasts, interviews, articles and social media posts on: Twitter:Â https://twitter.com/HealthRanger Brighteon.social:Â Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger Brighteon.io:Â Brighteon.io/healthranger Telegram:Â t.me/RealHealthRanger Brighteon.com:Â Brighteon.com/channels/HRreport Rumble:Â Rumble.com/c/HealthRangerReport Substack:Â HealthRanger.substack.com Banned.video:Â Banned.video/channel/mike-adams Bastyon:Â https://bastyon.com/healthranger Gettr:Â GETTR.com/user/healthranger BitChute:Â Bitchute.com/channel/9EB8glubb0Ns/ Clouthub:Â app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/naturalnews/posts My music with MP3 downloads and music videos:Â music.Brighteon.com Watch my 100+ interviews on decentralization and freedom at Decentralize.TV Join the freeÂ NaturalNews.com email newsletterÂ to stay alerted about breaking news each day.

The Censorship Industrial Complex: How We Got Here 1. The Government-Big Tech Nexus: A Decade of Collusion The 2016 election marked the beginning of open censorship warfare. After Donald Trumpâs victory, the Deep State panickedâand Big Tech became its enforcer. - 2017: Googleâs "Project Veritas" leaks revealed that the company was manipulating search results to bury conservative content. - 2018: Twitter shadowbanned prominent Republicans, including Devin Nunes and Charlie Kirk. - 2020: The Hunter Biden laptop story was suppressed by 51 intelligence officials (later proven to be CIA/FBI disinformation) in collusion with Twitter, Facebook, and Google. - 2021: The Biden White House openly admitted to flagging "misinformation" to Facebook for removal. - 2022: Missouri v. Biden exposed weekly meetings between the DHS, FBI, CDC, and Big Tech to coordinate censorship. - 2024: Brighteonâs lawsuit uncovered direct orders from the DoD to Google and NewsGuard to blacklist independent media. - 2025: Charlie Kirk was shotâafter years of being deplatformed, demonetized, and slandered by the same institutions that now celebrate his silencing. 2. The Mechanics of Censorship Laundering To bypass the First Amendment, the government outsources censorship to: - Foreign NGOs (e.g., Global Disinformation Index, Institute for Strategic Dialogue) - "Fact-checkers" (e.g., NewsGuard, PolitiFact)âfunded by the State Department and Big Pharma - AI-driven suppression (e.g., Googleâs "disinformation" filters, Facebookâs "community standards") - Payment processors (e.g., PayPal, Stripe banning dissident accounts) Example: If the CDC wants to silence vaccine criticism, it doesnât directly order Facebook to ban accountsâit funds a UK-based NGO (like the Global Disinformation Index), which then flags "anti-vax" content for removal. Facebook complies, claiming itâs just following "independent fact-checkers." This is money laundering for censorship. 3. The Human Cost: Ruined Lives, Stifled Debate, and Violence Censorship doesnât just suppress ideasâit destroys lives. - Mike Adams (Health Ranger): Banned from YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Google search for questioning COVID vaccines and advocating natural medicine. The reach of my businesses dropped 99% due to debanking and demonetization. - Robert F. Kennedy Jr.: Shadowbanned on Instagram, censored on YouTube, and smeared as a "conspiracy theorist" for criticizing Anthony Fauci and Big Pharma. - Tucker Carlson: Fired from Fox News after exposing the Ukraine biolabs story, then censored on X (Twitter) despite Elon Muskâs "free speech" promises. - Charlie Kirk: Banned from college campuses, demonetized on YouTube, and ultimately shotâafter years of being labeled an "extremist" by the SPLC and ADL. When lawful speech is criminalized, violence becomes inevitable. The shooting of Charlie Kirk is the direct result of a culture that treats conservative viewpoints as "dangerous" and seeks to silence them by any means possible. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act: Restoring the First Amendment 1. Defining "Large Platforms" (The New Public Square) Any entity with 1 million+ users/readers that functions as a digital public forum must adhere to First Amendment protections. This includes: - Social media (Facebook, X/Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube) - Search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) - Media outlets (CNN, NYT, WaPo, Fox News) - Universities (Harvard, Stanford, UC Berkeley) - Payment processors (PayPal, Stripe, Venmo) - Wikipedia & "Fact-Checkers" (PolitiFact, Snopes, NewsGuard) Exception: Small, niche platforms (e.g., a private Christian forum or a local hobbyist message board) would not be subject to these rules. 2. Absolute Ban on Viewpoint Discrimination The law would explicitly protect the following categories of speech: - Political speech (pro-Trump, anti-Biden, socialist, libertarianâall views) - Medical & scientific speech (vaccine criticism, natural cures, COVID origins, bioweapons discussions, psychiatric drugs) - Religious speech (Christian, Muslim, Jewish, atheistâno blasphemy bans) - Anti-government speech (criticism of the FBI, CIA, WHO, WEF, etc.) - Economic & financial speech (Bitcoin, gold, criticism of the Federal Reserve) - Historical & cultural speech (debates on slavery, WWII, 9/11, JFK assassination) Whatâs NOT protected? ? Direct incitement to violence ("Go kill [person] at [location]") ? True threats ("Iâm going to bomb [place]") ? Child pornography & exploitation ? Doxxing & harassment (releasing private info to encourage stalking) 3. $1 Billion Per Day Fines for Censorship Violations Algorithmic suppression? $1B/day. Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day. Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh? Because only existential financial consequences will force these monopolistic corporations to stop acting as government enforcers. 4. The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours.

After Donald Trumpâs victory, the Deep State panickedâand Big Tech became its enforcer. - 2017: Googleâs "Project Veritas" leaks revealed that the company was manipulating search results to bury conservative content. - 2018: Twitter shadowbanned prominent Republicans, including Devin Nunes and Charlie Kirk. - 2020: The Hunter Biden laptop story was suppressed by 51 intelligence officials (later proven to be CIA/FBI disinformation) in collusion with Twitter, Facebook, and Google. - 2021: The Biden White House openly admitted to flagging "misinformation" to Facebook for removal. - 2022: Missouri v. Biden exposed weekly meetings between the DHS, FBI, CDC, and Big Tech to coordinate censorship. - 2024: Brighteonâs lawsuit uncovered direct orders from the DoD to Google and NewsGuard to blacklist independent media. - 2025: Charlie Kirk was shotâafter years of being deplatformed, demonetized, and slandered by the same institutions that now celebrate his silencing. 2. The Mechanics of Censorship Laundering To bypass the First Amendment, the government outsources censorship to: - Foreign NGOs (e.g., Global Disinformation Index, Institute for Strategic Dialogue) - "Fact-checkers" (e.g., NewsGuard, PolitiFact)âfunded by the State Department and Big Pharma - AI-driven suppression (e.g., Googleâs "disinformation" filters, Facebookâs "community standards") - Payment processors (e.g., PayPal, Stripe banning dissident accounts) Example: If the CDC wants to silence vaccine criticism, it doesnât directly order Facebook to ban accountsâit funds a UK-based NGO (like the Global Disinformation Index), which then flags "anti-vax" content for removal. Facebook complies, claiming itâs just following "independent fact-checkers." This is money laundering for censorship. 3. The Human Cost: Ruined Lives, Stifled Debate, and Violence Censorship doesnât just suppress ideasâit destroys lives. - Mike Adams (Health Ranger): Banned from YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Google search for questioning COVID vaccines and advocating natural medicine. The reach of my businesses dropped 99% due to debanking and demonetization. - Robert F. Kennedy Jr.: Shadowbanned on Instagram, censored on YouTube, and smeared as a "conspiracy theorist" for criticizing Anthony Fauci and Big Pharma. - Tucker Carlson: Fired from Fox News after exposing the Ukraine biolabs story, then censored on X (Twitter) despite Elon Muskâs "free speech" promises. - Charlie Kirk: Banned from college campuses, demonetized on YouTube, and ultimately shotâafter years of being labeled an "extremist" by the SPLC and ADL. When lawful speech is criminalized, violence becomes inevitable. The shooting of Charlie Kirk is the direct result of a culture that treats conservative viewpoints as "dangerous" and seeks to silence them by any means possible. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act: Restoring the First Amendment 1. Defining "Large Platforms" (The New Public Square) Any entity with 1 million+ users/readers that functions as a digital public forum must adhere to First Amendment protections. This includes: - Social media (Facebook, X/Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube) - Search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) - Media outlets (CNN, NYT, WaPo, Fox News) - Universities (Harvard, Stanford, UC Berkeley) - Payment processors (PayPal, Stripe, Venmo) - Wikipedia & "Fact-Checkers" (PolitiFact, Snopes, NewsGuard) Exception: Small, niche platforms (e.g., a private Christian forum or a local hobbyist message board) would not be subject to these rules. 2. Absolute Ban on Viewpoint Discrimination The law would explicitly protect the following categories of speech: - Political speech (pro-Trump, anti-Biden, socialist, libertarianâall views) - Medical & scientific speech (vaccine criticism, natural cures, COVID origins, bioweapons discussions, psychiatric drugs) - Religious speech (Christian, Muslim, Jewish, atheistâno blasphemy bans) - Anti-government speech (criticism of the FBI, CIA, WHO, WEF, etc.) - Economic & financial speech (Bitcoin, gold, criticism of the Federal Reserve) - Historical & cultural speech (debates on slavery, WWII, 9/11, JFK assassination) Whatâs NOT protected? ? Direct incitement to violence ("Go kill [person] at [location]") ? True threats ("Iâm going to bomb [place]") ? Child pornography & exploitation ? Doxxing & harassment (releasing private info to encourage stalking) 3. $1 Billion Per Day Fines for Censorship Violations Algorithmic suppression? $1B/day. Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day. Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh? Because only existential financial consequences will force these monopolistic corporations to stop acting as government enforcers. 4. The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America. God bless free speech. ### Follow my podcasts, interviews, articles and social media posts on: Twitter:Â https://twitter.com/HealthRanger Brighteon.social:Â Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger Brighteon.io:Â Brighteon.io/healthranger Telegram:Â t.me/RealHealthRanger Brighteon.com:Â Brighteon.com/channels/HRreport Rumble:Â Rumble.com/c/HealthRangerReport Substack:Â HealthRanger.substack.com Banned.video:Â Banned.video/channel/mike-adams Bastyon:Â https://bastyon.com/healthranger Gettr:Â GETTR.com/user/healthranger BitChute:Â Bitchute.com/channel/9EB8glubb0Ns/ Clouthub:Â app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/naturalnews/posts My music with MP3 downloads and music videos:Â music.Brighteon.com Watch my 100+ interviews on decentralization and freedom at Decentralize.TV Join the freeÂ NaturalNews.com email newsletterÂ to stay alerted about breaking news each day.

This includes: - Social media (Facebook, X/Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube) - Search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) - Media outlets (CNN, NYT, WaPo, Fox News) - Universities (Harvard, Stanford, UC Berkeley) - Payment processors (PayPal, Stripe, Venmo) - Wikipedia & "Fact-Checkers" (PolitiFact, Snopes, NewsGuard) Exception: Small, niche platforms (e.g., a private Christian forum or a local hobbyist message board) would not be subject to these rules. 2. Absolute Ban on Viewpoint Discrimination The law would explicitly protect the following categories of speech: - Political speech (pro-Trump, anti-Biden, socialist, libertarianâall views) - Medical & scientific speech (vaccine criticism, natural cures, COVID origins, bioweapons discussions, psychiatric drugs) - Religious speech (Christian, Muslim, Jewish, atheistâno blasphemy bans) - Anti-government speech (criticism of the FBI, CIA, WHO, WEF, etc.) - Economic & financial speech (Bitcoin, gold, criticism of the Federal Reserve) - Historical & cultural speech (debates on slavery, WWII, 9/11, JFK assassination) Whatâs NOT protected? ? Direct incitement to violence ("Go kill [person] at [location]") ? True threats ("Iâm going to bomb [place]") ? Child pornography & exploitation ? Doxxing & harassment (releasing private info to encourage stalking) 3. $1 Billion Per Day Fines for Censorship Violations Algorithmic suppression? $1B/day. Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day. Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh? Because only existential financial consequences will force these monopolistic corporations to stop acting as government enforcers. 4. The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America. God bless free speech. ### Follow my podcasts, interviews, articles and social media posts on: Twitter:Â https://twitter.com/HealthRanger Brighteon.social:Â Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger Brighteon.io:Â Brighteon.io/healthranger Telegram:Â t.me/RealHealthRanger Brighteon.com:Â Brighteon.com/channels/HRreport Rumble:Â Rumble.com/c/HealthRangerReport Substack:Â HealthRanger.substack.com Banned.video:Â Banned.video/channel/mike-adams Bastyon:Â https://bastyon.com/healthranger Gettr:Â GETTR.com/user/healthranger BitChute:Â Bitchute.com/channel/9EB8glubb0Ns/ Clouthub:Â app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/naturalnews/posts My music with MP3 downloads and music videos:Â music.Brighteon.com Watch my 100+ interviews on decentralization and freedom at Decentralize.TV Join the freeÂ NaturalNews.com email newsletterÂ to stay alerted about breaking news each day.

Biden exposed weekly meetings between the DHS, FBI, CDC, and Big Tech to coordinate censorship. - 2024: Brighteonâs lawsuit uncovered direct orders from the DoD to Google and NewsGuard to blacklist independent media. - 2025: Charlie Kirk was shotâafter years of being deplatformed, demonetized, and slandered by the same institutions that now celebrate his silencing. 2. The Mechanics of Censorship Laundering To bypass the First Amendment, the government outsources censorship to: - Foreign NGOs (e.g., Global Disinformation Index, Institute for Strategic Dialogue) - "Fact-checkers" (e.g., NewsGuard, PolitiFact)âfunded by the State Department and Big Pharma - AI-driven suppression (e.g., Googleâs "disinformation" filters, Facebookâs "community standards") - Payment processors (e.g., PayPal, Stripe banning dissident accounts) Example: If the CDC wants to silence vaccine criticism, it doesnât directly order Facebook to ban accountsâit funds a UK-based NGO (like the Global Disinformation Index), which then flags "anti-vax" content for removal. Facebook complies, claiming itâs just following "independent fact-checkers." This is money laundering for censorship. 3. The Human Cost: Ruined Lives, Stifled Debate, and Violence Censorship doesnât just suppress ideasâit destroys lives. - Mike Adams (Health Ranger): Banned from YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Google search for questioning COVID vaccines and advocating natural medicine. The reach of my businesses dropped 99% due to debanking and demonetization. - Robert F. Kennedy Jr.: Shadowbanned on Instagram, censored on YouTube, and smeared as a "conspiracy theorist" for criticizing Anthony Fauci and Big Pharma. - Tucker Carlson: Fired from Fox News after exposing the Ukraine biolabs story, then censored on X (Twitter) despite Elon Muskâs "free speech" promises. - Charlie Kirk: Banned from college campuses, demonetized on YouTube, and ultimately shotâafter years of being labeled an "extremist" by the SPLC and ADL. When lawful speech is criminalized, violence becomes inevitable. The shooting of Charlie Kirk is the direct result of a culture that treats conservative viewpoints as "dangerous" and seeks to silence them by any means possible.

Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America. God bless free speech. ### Follow my podcasts, interviews, articles and social media posts on: Twitter:Â https://twitter.com/HealthRanger Brighteon.social:Â Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger Brighteon.io:Â Brighteon.io/healthranger Telegram:Â t.me/RealHealthRanger Brighteon.com:Â Brighteon.com/channels/HRreport Rumble:Â Rumble.com/c/HealthRangerReport Substack:Â HealthRanger.substack.com Banned.video:Â Banned.video/channel/mike-adams Bastyon:Â https://bastyon.com/healthranger Gettr:Â GETTR.com/user/healthranger BitChute:Â Bitchute.com/channel/9EB8glubb0Ns/ Clouthub:Â app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/naturalnews/posts My music with MP3 downloads and music videos:Â music.Brighteon.com Watch my 100+ interviews on decentralization and freedom at Decentralize.TV Join the freeÂ NaturalNews.com email newsletterÂ to stay alerted about breaking news each day. Download my current audio books -- including Ghost World, Survival Nutrition, The Global Reset Survival Guide and The Contagious Mind -- at: https://Audiobooks.NaturalNews.com/ Download my popular audio book, "Resilient Prepping" atÂ ResilientPrepping.comÂ - it teaches you how to survive the total collapse of civilization and the loss of both the power grid and combustion engines. - 2024: Brighteonâs lawsuit uncovered direct orders from the DoD to Google and NewsGuard to blacklist independent media. - 2025: Charlie Kirk was shotâafter years of being deplatformed, demonetized, and slandered by the same institutions that now celebrate his silencing. 2. The Mechanics of Censorship Laundering To bypass the First Amendment, the government outsources censorship to: - Foreign NGOs (e.g., Global Disinformation Index, Institute for Strategic Dialogue) - "Fact-checkers" (e.g., NewsGuard, PolitiFact)âfunded by the State Department and Big Pharma - AI-driven suppression (e.g., Googleâs "disinformation" filters, Facebookâs "community standards") - Payment processors (e.g., PayPal, Stripe banning dissident accounts) Example: If the CDC wants to silence vaccine criticism, it doesnât directly order Facebook to ban accountsâit funds a UK-based NGO (like the Global Disinformation Index), which then flags "anti-vax" content for removal. Facebook complies, claiming itâs just following "independent fact-checkers." This is money laundering for censorship. 3. The Human Cost: Ruined Lives, Stifled Debate, and Violence Censorship doesnât just suppress ideasâit destroys lives. - Mike Adams (Health Ranger): Banned from YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Google search for questioning COVID vaccines and advocating natural medicine. The reach of my businesses dropped 99% due to debanking and demonetization. - Robert F. Kennedy Jr.: Shadowbanned on Instagram, censored on YouTube, and smeared as a "conspiracy theorist" for criticizing Anthony Fauci and Big Pharma. - Tucker Carlson: Fired from Fox News after exposing the Ukraine biolabs story, then censored on X (Twitter) despite Elon Muskâs "free speech" promises. - Charlie Kirk: Banned from college campuses, demonetized on YouTube, and ultimately shotâafter years of being labeled an "extremist" by the SPLC and ADL. When lawful speech is criminalized, violence becomes inevitable. The shooting of Charlie Kirk is the direct result of a culture that treats conservative viewpoints as "dangerous" and seeks to silence them by any means possible. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act: Restoring the First Amendment 1. Defining "Large Platforms" (The New Public Square) Any entity with 1 million+ users/readers that functions as a digital public forum must adhere to First Amendment protections. This includes: - Social media (Facebook, X/Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube) - Search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) - Media outlets (CNN, NYT, WaPo, Fox News) - Universities (Harvard, Stanford, UC Berkeley) - Payment processors (PayPal, Stripe, Venmo) - Wikipedia & "Fact-Checkers" (PolitiFact, Snopes, NewsGuard) Exception: Small, niche platforms (e.g., a private Christian forum or a local hobbyist message board) would not be subject to these rules. 2. Absolute Ban on Viewpoint Discrimination The law would explicitly protect the following categories of speech: - Political speech (pro-Trump, anti-Biden, socialist, libertarianâall views) - Medical & scientific speech (vaccine criticism, natural cures, COVID origins, bioweapons discussions, psychiatric drugs) - Religious speech (Christian, Muslim, Jewish, atheistâno blasphemy bans) - Anti-government speech (criticism of the FBI, CIA, WHO, WEF, etc.) - Economic & financial speech (Bitcoin, gold, criticism of the Federal Reserve) - Historical & cultural speech (debates on slavery, WWII, 9/11, JFK assassination) Whatâs NOT protected? ? Direct incitement to violence ("Go kill [person] at [location]") ? True threats ("Iâm going to bomb [place]") ? Child pornography & exploitation ? Doxxing & harassment (releasing private info to encourage stalking) 3. $1 Billion Per Day Fines for Censorship Violations Algorithmic suppression? $1B/day. Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day. Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh? Because only existential financial consequences will force these monopolistic corporations to stop acting as government enforcers. 4. The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2.

This includes: - Social media (Facebook, X/Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube) - Search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) - Media outlets (CNN, NYT, WaPo, Fox News) - Universities (Harvard, Stanford, UC Berkeley) - Payment processors (PayPal, Stripe, Venmo) - Wikipedia & "Fact-Checkers" (PolitiFact, Snopes, NewsGuard) Exception: Small, niche platforms (e.g., a private Christian forum or a local hobbyist message board) would not be subject to these rules. 2. Absolute Ban on Viewpoint Discrimination The law would explicitly protect the following categories of speech: - Political speech (pro-Trump, anti-Biden, socialist, libertarianâall views) - Medical & scientific speech (vaccine criticism, natural cures, COVID origins, bioweapons discussions, psychiatric drugs) - Religious speech (Christian, Muslim, Jewish, atheistâno blasphemy bans) - Anti-government speech (criticism of the FBI, CIA, WHO, WEF, etc.) - Economic & financial speech (Bitcoin, gold, criticism of the Federal Reserve) - Historical & cultural speech (debates on slavery, WWII, 9/11, JFK assassination) Whatâs NOT protected? ? Direct incitement to violence ("Go kill [person] at [location]") ? True threats ("Iâm going to bomb [place]") ? Child pornography & exploitation ? Doxxing & harassment (releasing private info to encourage stalking) 3. $1 Billion Per Day Fines for Censorship Violations Algorithmic suppression? $1B/day. Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day. Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh? Because only existential financial consequences will force these monopolistic corporations to stop acting as government enforcers. 4. The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America. God bless free speech. ### Follow my podcasts, interviews, articles and social media posts on: Twitter:Â https://twitter.com/HealthRanger Brighteon.social:Â Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger Brighteon.io:Â Brighteon.io/healthranger Telegram:Â t.me/RealHealthRanger Brighteon.com:Â Brighteon.com/channels/HRreport Rumble:Â Rumble.com/c/HealthRangerReport Substack:Â HealthRanger.substack.com Banned.video:Â Banned.video/channel/mike-adams Bastyon:Â https://bastyon.com/healthranger Gettr:Â GETTR.com/user/healthranger BitChute:Â Bitchute.com/channel/9EB8glubb0Ns/ Clouthub:Â app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/naturalnews/posts My music with MP3 downloads and music videos:Â music.Brighteon.com Watch my 100+ interviews on decentralization and freedom at Decentralize.TV Join the freeÂ NaturalNews.com email newsletterÂ to stay alerted about breaking news each day.

To bypass the First Amendment, the government outsources censorship to: - Foreign NGOs (e.g., Global Disinformation Index, Institute for Strategic Dialogue) - "Fact-checkers" (e.g., NewsGuard, PolitiFact)âfunded by the State Department and Big Pharma - AI-driven suppression (e.g., Googleâs "disinformation" filters, Facebookâs "community standards") - Payment processors (e.g., PayPal, Stripe banning dissident accounts) Example: If the CDC wants to silence vaccine criticism, it doesnât directly order Facebook to ban accountsâit funds a UK-based NGO (like the Global Disinformation Index), which then flags "anti-vax" content for removal. Facebook complies, claiming itâs just following "independent fact-checkers." This is money laundering for censorship. 3. The Human Cost: Ruined Lives, Stifled Debate, and Violence Censorship doesnât just suppress ideasâit destroys lives. - Mike Adams (Health Ranger): Banned from YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Google search for questioning COVID vaccines and advocating natural medicine. The reach of my businesses dropped 99% due to debanking and demonetization. - Robert F. Kennedy Jr.: Shadowbanned on Instagram, censored on YouTube, and smeared as a "conspiracy theorist" for criticizing Anthony Fauci and Big Pharma. - Tucker Carlson: Fired from Fox News after exposing the Ukraine biolabs story, then censored on X (Twitter) despite Elon Muskâs "free speech" promises. - Charlie Kirk: Banned from college campuses, demonetized on YouTube, and ultimately shotâafter years of being labeled an "extremist" by the SPLC and ADL. When lawful speech is criminalized, violence becomes inevitable. The shooting of Charlie Kirk is the direct result of a culture that treats conservative viewpoints as "dangerous" and seeks to silence them by any means possible.

Facebook complies, claiming itâs just following "independent fact-checkers." This is money laundering for censorship. 3. The Human Cost: Ruined Lives, Stifled Debate, and Violence Censorship doesnât just suppress ideasâit destroys lives. - Mike Adams (Health Ranger): Banned from YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Google search for questioning COVID vaccines and advocating natural medicine. The reach of my businesses dropped 99% due to debanking and demonetization. - Robert F. Kennedy Jr.: Shadowbanned on Instagram, censored on YouTube, and smeared as a "conspiracy theorist" for criticizing Anthony Fauci and Big Pharma. - Tucker Carlson: Fired from Fox News after exposing the Ukraine biolabs story, then censored on X (Twitter) despite Elon Muskâs "free speech" promises. - Charlie Kirk: Banned from college campuses, demonetized on YouTube, and ultimately shotâafter years of being labeled an "extremist" by the SPLC and ADL. When lawful speech is criminalized, violence becomes inevitable. The shooting of Charlie Kirk is the direct result of a culture that treats conservative viewpoints as "dangerous" and seeks to silence them by any means possible. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act: Restoring the First Amendment 1. Defining "Large Platforms" (The New Public Square) Any entity with 1 million+ users/readers that functions as a digital public forum must adhere to First Amendment protections. This includes: - Social media (Facebook, X/Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube) - Search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) - Media outlets (CNN, NYT, WaPo, Fox News) - Universities (Harvard, Stanford, UC Berkeley) - Payment processors (PayPal, Stripe, Venmo) - Wikipedia & "Fact-Checkers" (PolitiFact, Snopes, NewsGuard) Exception: Small, niche platforms (e.g., a private Christian forum or a local hobbyist message board) would not be subject to these rules. 2. Absolute Ban on Viewpoint Discrimination The law would explicitly protect the following categories of speech: - Political speech (pro-Trump, anti-Biden, socialist, libertarianâall views) - Medical & scientific speech (vaccine criticism, natural cures, COVID origins, bioweapons discussions, psychiatric drugs) - Religious speech (Christian, Muslim, Jewish, atheistâno blasphemy bans) - Anti-government speech (criticism of the FBI, CIA, WHO, WEF, etc.) - Economic & financial speech (Bitcoin, gold, criticism of the Federal Reserve) - Historical & cultural speech (debates on slavery, WWII, 9/11, JFK assassination) Whatâs NOT protected? ? Direct incitement to violence ("Go kill [person] at [location]") ? True threats ("Iâm going to bomb [place]") ? Child pornography & exploitation ? Doxxing & harassment (releasing private info to encourage stalking) 3. $1 Billion Per Day Fines for Censorship Violations Algorithmic suppression? $1B/day. Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day. Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh? Because only existential financial consequences will force these monopolistic corporations to stop acting as government enforcers. 4. The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives.

The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America.

Download my current audio books -- including Ghost World, Survival Nutrition, The Global Reset Survival Guide and The Contagious Mind -- at: https://Audiobooks.NaturalNews.com/ Download my popular audio book, "Resilient Prepping" atÂ ResilientPrepping.comÂ - it teaches you how to survive the total collapse of civilization and the loss of both the power grid and combustion engines. Example: If the CDC wants to silence vaccine criticism, it doesnât directly order Facebook to ban accountsâit funds a UK-based NGO (like the Global Disinformation Index), which then flags "anti-vax" content for removal. Facebook complies, claiming itâs just following "independent fact-checkers." This is money laundering for censorship. 3. The Human Cost: Ruined Lives, Stifled Debate, and Violence Censorship doesnât just suppress ideasâit destroys lives. - Mike Adams (Health Ranger): Banned from YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Google search for questioning COVID vaccines and advocating natural medicine. The reach of my businesses dropped 99% due to debanking and demonetization. - Robert F. Kennedy Jr.: Shadowbanned on Instagram, censored on YouTube, and smeared as a "conspiracy theorist" for criticizing Anthony Fauci and Big Pharma. - Tucker Carlson: Fired from Fox News after exposing the Ukraine biolabs story, then censored on X (Twitter) despite Elon Muskâs "free speech" promises. - Charlie Kirk: Banned from college campuses, demonetized on YouTube, and ultimately shotâafter years of being labeled an "extremist" by the SPLC and ADL. When lawful speech is criminalized, violence becomes inevitable. The shooting of Charlie Kirk is the direct result of a culture that treats conservative viewpoints as "dangerous" and seeks to silence them by any means possible. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act: Restoring the First Amendment 1. Defining "Large Platforms" (The New Public Square) Any entity with 1 million+ users/readers that functions as a digital public forum must adhere to First Amendment protections. This includes: - Social media (Facebook, X/Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube) - Search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) - Media outlets (CNN, NYT, WaPo, Fox News) - Universities (Harvard, Stanford, UC Berkeley) - Payment processors (PayPal, Stripe, Venmo) - Wikipedia & "Fact-Checkers" (PolitiFact, Snopes, NewsGuard) Exception: Small, niche platforms (e.g., a private Christian forum or a local hobbyist message board) would not be subject to these rules. 2. Absolute Ban on Viewpoint Discrimination The law would explicitly protect the following categories of speech: - Political speech (pro-Trump, anti-Biden, socialist, libertarianâall views) - Medical & scientific speech (vaccine criticism, natural cures, COVID origins, bioweapons discussions, psychiatric drugs) - Religious speech (Christian, Muslim, Jewish, atheistâno blasphemy bans) - Anti-government speech (criticism of the FBI, CIA, WHO, WEF, etc.) - Economic & financial speech (Bitcoin, gold, criticism of the Federal Reserve) - Historical & cultural speech (debates on slavery, WWII, 9/11, JFK assassination) Whatâs NOT protected? ? Direct incitement to violence ("Go kill [person] at [location]") ? True threats ("Iâm going to bomb [place]") ? Child pornography & exploitation ? Doxxing & harassment (releasing private info to encourage stalking) 3. $1 Billion Per Day Fines for Censorship Violations Algorithmic suppression? $1B/day. Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day. Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh? Because only existential financial consequences will force these monopolistic corporations to stop acting as government enforcers. 4. The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time.

The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America. God bless free speech. ### Follow my podcasts, interviews, articles and social media posts on: Twitter:Â https://twitter.com/HealthRanger Brighteon.social:Â Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger Brighteon.io:Â Brighteon.io/healthranger Telegram:Â t.me/RealHealthRanger Brighteon.com:Â Brighteon.com/channels/HRreport Rumble:Â Rumble.com/c/HealthRangerReport Substack:Â HealthRanger.substack.com Banned.video:Â Banned.video/channel/mike-adams Bastyon:Â https://bastyon.com/healthranger Gettr:Â GETTR.com/user/healthranger BitChute:Â Bitchute.com/channel/9EB8glubb0Ns/ Clouthub:Â app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/naturalnews/posts My music with MP3 downloads and music videos:Â music.Brighteon.com Watch my 100+ interviews on decentralization and freedom at Decentralize.TV Join the freeÂ NaturalNews.com email newsletterÂ to stay alerted about breaking news each day.

The Human Cost: Ruined Lives, Stifled Debate, and Violence Censorship doesnât just suppress ideasâit destroys lives. - Mike Adams (Health Ranger): Banned from YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Google search for questioning COVID vaccines and advocating natural medicine. The reach of my businesses dropped 99% due to debanking and demonetization. - Robert F. Kennedy Jr.: Shadowbanned on Instagram, censored on YouTube, and smeared as a "conspiracy theorist" for criticizing Anthony Fauci and Big Pharma. - Tucker Carlson: Fired from Fox News after exposing the Ukraine biolabs story, then censored on X (Twitter) despite Elon Muskâs "free speech" promises. - Charlie Kirk: Banned from college campuses, demonetized on YouTube, and ultimately shotâafter years of being labeled an "extremist" by the SPLC and ADL. When lawful speech is criminalized, violence becomes inevitable. The shooting of Charlie Kirk is the direct result of a culture that treats conservative viewpoints as "dangerous" and seeks to silence them by any means possible. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act: Restoring the First Amendment 1. Defining "Large Platforms" (The New Public Square) Any entity with 1 million+ users/readers that functions as a digital public forum must adhere to First Amendment protections. This includes: - Social media (Facebook, X/Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube) - Search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) - Media outlets (CNN, NYT, WaPo, Fox News) - Universities (Harvard, Stanford, UC Berkeley) - Payment processors (PayPal, Stripe, Venmo) - Wikipedia & "Fact-Checkers" (PolitiFact, Snopes, NewsGuard) Exception: Small, niche platforms (e.g., a private Christian forum or a local hobbyist message board) would not be subject to these rules. 2. Absolute Ban on Viewpoint Discrimination The law would explicitly protect the following categories of speech: - Political speech (pro-Trump, anti-Biden, socialist, libertarianâall views) - Medical & scientific speech (vaccine criticism, natural cures, COVID origins, bioweapons discussions, psychiatric drugs) - Religious speech (Christian, Muslim, Jewish, atheistâno blasphemy bans) - Anti-government speech (criticism of the FBI, CIA, WHO, WEF, etc.) - Economic & financial speech (Bitcoin, gold, criticism of the Federal Reserve) - Historical & cultural speech (debates on slavery, WWII, 9/11, JFK assassination) Whatâs NOT protected? ? Direct incitement to violence ("Go kill [person] at [location]") ? True threats ("Iâm going to bomb [place]") ? Child pornography & exploitation ? Doxxing & harassment (releasing private info to encourage stalking) 3. $1 Billion Per Day Fines for Censorship Violations Algorithmic suppression? $1B/day. Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day.

The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America. God bless free speech. ### Follow my podcasts, interviews, articles and social media posts on: Twitter:Â https://twitter.com/HealthRanger Brighteon.social:Â Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger Brighteon.io:Â Brighteon.io/healthranger Telegram:Â t.me/RealHealthRanger Brighteon.com:Â Brighteon.com/channels/HRreport Rumble:Â Rumble.com/c/HealthRangerReport Substack:Â HealthRanger.substack.com Banned.video:Â Banned.video/channel/mike-adams Bastyon:Â https://bastyon.com/healthranger Gettr:Â GETTR.com/user/healthranger BitChute:Â Bitchute.com/channel/9EB8glubb0Ns/ Clouthub:Â app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/naturalnews/posts My music with MP3 downloads and music videos:Â music.Brighteon.com Watch my 100+ interviews on decentralization and freedom at Decentralize.TV Join the freeÂ NaturalNews.com email newsletterÂ to stay alerted about breaking news each day.

When lawful speech is criminalized, violence becomes inevitable. The shooting of Charlie Kirk is the direct result of a culture that treats conservative viewpoints as "dangerous" and seeks to silence them by any means possible. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act: Restoring the First Amendment 1. Defining "Large Platforms" (The New Public Square) Any entity with 1 million+ users/readers that functions as a digital public forum must adhere to First Amendment protections. This includes: - Social media (Facebook, X/Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube) - Search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) - Media outlets (CNN, NYT, WaPo, Fox News) - Universities (Harvard, Stanford, UC Berkeley) - Payment processors (PayPal, Stripe, Venmo) - Wikipedia & "Fact-Checkers" (PolitiFact, Snopes, NewsGuard) Exception: Small, niche platforms (e.g., a private Christian forum or a local hobbyist message board) would not be subject to these rules. 2. Absolute Ban on Viewpoint Discrimination The law would explicitly protect the following categories of speech: - Political speech (pro-Trump, anti-Biden, socialist, libertarianâall views) - Medical & scientific speech (vaccine criticism, natural cures, COVID origins, bioweapons discussions, psychiatric drugs) - Religious speech (Christian, Muslim, Jewish, atheistâno blasphemy bans) - Anti-government speech (criticism of the FBI, CIA, WHO, WEF, etc.) - Economic & financial speech (Bitcoin, gold, criticism of the Federal Reserve) - Historical & cultural speech (debates on slavery, WWII, 9/11, JFK assassination) Whatâs NOT protected? ? Direct incitement to violence ("Go kill [person] at [location]") ? True threats ("Iâm going to bomb [place]") ? Child pornography & exploitation ? Doxxing & harassment (releasing private info to encourage stalking) 3. $1 Billion Per Day Fines for Censorship Violations Algorithmic suppression? $1B/day. Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day.

Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America. God bless free speech. ### Follow my podcasts, interviews, articles and social media posts on: Twitter:Â https://twitter.com/HealthRanger Brighteon.social:Â Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger Brighteon.io:Â Brighteon.io/healthranger Telegram:Â t.me/RealHealthRanger Brighteon.com:Â Brighteon.com/channels/HRreport Rumble:Â Rumble.com/c/HealthRangerReport Substack:Â HealthRanger.substack.com Banned.video:Â Banned.video/channel/mike-adams Bastyon:Â https://bastyon.com/healthranger Gettr:Â GETTR.com/user/healthranger BitChute:Â Bitchute.com/channel/9EB8glubb0Ns/ Clouthub:Â app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/naturalnews/posts My music with MP3 downloads and music videos:Â music.Brighteon.com Watch my 100+ interviews on decentralization and freedom at Decentralize.TV Join the freeÂ NaturalNews.com email newsletterÂ to stay alerted about breaking news each day.

When lawful speech is criminalized, violence becomes inevitable. The shooting of Charlie Kirk is the direct result of a culture that treats conservative viewpoints as "dangerous" and seeks to silence them by any means possible. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act: Restoring the First Amendment 1. Defining "Large Platforms" (The New Public Square) Any entity with 1 million+ users/readers that functions as a digital public forum must adhere to First Amendment protections. This includes: - Social media (Facebook, X/Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube) - Search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) - Media outlets (CNN, NYT, WaPo, Fox News) - Universities (Harvard, Stanford, UC Berkeley) - Payment processors (PayPal, Stripe, Venmo) - Wikipedia & "Fact-Checkers" (PolitiFact, Snopes, NewsGuard) Exception: Small, niche platforms (e.g., a private Christian forum or a local hobbyist message board) would not be subject to these rules. 2. Absolute Ban on Viewpoint Discrimination The law would explicitly protect the following categories of speech: - Political speech (pro-Trump, anti-Biden, socialist, libertarianâall views) - Medical & scientific speech (vaccine criticism, natural cures, COVID origins, bioweapons discussions, psychiatric drugs) - Religious speech (Christian, Muslim, Jewish, atheistâno blasphemy bans) - Anti-government speech (criticism of the FBI, CIA, WHO, WEF, etc.) - Economic & financial speech (Bitcoin, gold, criticism of the Federal Reserve) - Historical & cultural speech (debates on slavery, WWII, 9/11, JFK assassination) Whatâs NOT protected? ? Direct incitement to violence ("Go kill [person] at [location]") ? True threats ("Iâm going to bomb [place]") ? Child pornography & exploitation ? Doxxing & harassment (releasing private info to encourage stalking) 3. $1 Billion Per Day Fines for Censorship Violations Algorithmic suppression? $1B/day. Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day. Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh? Because only existential financial consequences will force these monopolistic corporations to stop acting as government enforcers. 4.

Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America. God bless free speech. ### Follow my podcasts, interviews, articles and social media posts on: Twitter:Â https://twitter.com/HealthRanger Brighteon.social:Â Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger Brighteon.io:Â Brighteon.io/healthranger Telegram:Â t.me/RealHealthRanger Brighteon.com:Â Brighteon.com/channels/HRreport Rumble:Â Rumble.com/c/HealthRangerReport Substack:Â HealthRanger.substack.com Banned.video:Â Banned.video/channel/mike-adams Bastyon:Â https://bastyon.com/healthranger Gettr:Â GETTR.com/user/healthranger BitChute:Â Bitchute.com/channel/9EB8glubb0Ns/ Clouthub:Â app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/naturalnews/posts My music with MP3 downloads and music videos:Â music.Brighteon.com Watch my 100+ interviews on decentralization and freedom at Decentralize.TV Join the freeÂ NaturalNews.com email newsletterÂ to stay alerted about breaking news each day. Download my current audio books -- including Ghost World, Survival Nutrition, The Global Reset Survival Guide and The Contagious Mind -- at: https://Audiobooks.NaturalNews.com/ Download my popular audio book, "Resilient Prepping" atÂ ResilientPrepping.comÂ - it teaches you how to survive the total collapse of civilization and the loss of both the power grid and combustion engines. When lawful speech is criminalized, violence becomes inevitable. The shooting of Charlie Kirk is the direct result of a culture that treats conservative viewpoints as "dangerous" and seeks to silence them by any means possible. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act: Restoring the First Amendment 1. Defining "Large Platforms" (The New Public Square) Any entity with 1 million+ users/readers that functions as a digital public forum must adhere to First Amendment protections. This includes: - Social media (Facebook, X/Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube) - Search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) - Media outlets (CNN, NYT, WaPo, Fox News) - Universities (Harvard, Stanford, UC Berkeley) - Payment processors (PayPal, Stripe, Venmo) - Wikipedia & "Fact-Checkers" (PolitiFact, Snopes, NewsGuard) Exception: Small, niche platforms (e.g., a private Christian forum or a local hobbyist message board) would not be subject to these rules. 2. Absolute Ban on Viewpoint Discrimination The law would explicitly protect the following categories of speech: - Political speech (pro-Trump, anti-Biden, socialist, libertarianâall views) - Medical & scientific speech (vaccine criticism, natural cures, COVID origins, bioweapons discussions, psychiatric drugs) - Religious speech (Christian, Muslim, Jewish, atheistâno blasphemy bans) - Anti-government speech (criticism of the FBI, CIA, WHO, WEF, etc.) - Economic & financial speech (Bitcoin, gold, criticism of the Federal Reserve) - Historical & cultural speech (debates on slavery, WWII, 9/11, JFK assassination) Whatâs NOT protected? ? Direct incitement to violence ("Go kill [person] at [location]") ? True threats ("Iâm going to bomb [place]") ? Child pornography & exploitation ? Doxxing & harassment (releasing private info to encourage stalking) 3. $1 Billion Per Day Fines for Censorship Violations Algorithmic suppression? $1B/day. Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day. Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh? Because only existential financial consequences will force these monopolistic corporations to stop acting as government enforcers. 4. The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science.

This includes: - Social media (Facebook, X/Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube) - Search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) - Media outlets (CNN, NYT, WaPo, Fox News) - Universities (Harvard, Stanford, UC Berkeley) - Payment processors (PayPal, Stripe, Venmo) - Wikipedia & "Fact-Checkers" (PolitiFact, Snopes, NewsGuard) Exception: Small, niche platforms (e.g., a private Christian forum or a local hobbyist message board) would not be subject to these rules. 2. Absolute Ban on Viewpoint Discrimination The law would explicitly protect the following categories of speech: - Political speech (pro-Trump, anti-Biden, socialist, libertarianâall views) - Medical & scientific speech (vaccine criticism, natural cures, COVID origins, bioweapons discussions, psychiatric drugs) - Religious speech (Christian, Muslim, Jewish, atheistâno blasphemy bans) - Anti-government speech (criticism of the FBI, CIA, WHO, WEF, etc.) - Economic & financial speech (Bitcoin, gold, criticism of the Federal Reserve) - Historical & cultural speech (debates on slavery, WWII, 9/11, JFK assassination) Whatâs NOT protected? ? Direct incitement to violence ("Go kill [person] at [location]") ? True threats ("Iâm going to bomb [place]") ? Child pornography & exploitation ? Doxxing & harassment (releasing private info to encourage stalking) 3. $1 Billion Per Day Fines for Censorship Violations Algorithmic suppression? $1B/day. Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day. Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh? Because only existential financial consequences will force these monopolistic corporations to stop acting as government enforcers. 4. The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America. God bless free speech. ### Follow my podcasts, interviews, articles and social media posts on: Twitter:Â https://twitter.com/HealthRanger Brighteon.social:Â Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger Brighteon.io:Â Brighteon.io/healthranger Telegram:Â t.me/RealHealthRanger Brighteon.com:Â Brighteon.com/channels/HRreport Rumble:Â Rumble.com/c/HealthRangerReport Substack:Â HealthRanger.substack.com Banned.video:Â Banned.video/channel/mike-adams Bastyon:Â https://bastyon.com/healthranger Gettr:Â GETTR.com/user/healthranger BitChute:Â Bitchute.com/channel/9EB8glubb0Ns/ Clouthub:Â app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/naturalnews/posts My music with MP3 downloads and music videos:Â music.Brighteon.com Watch my 100+ interviews on decentralization and freedom at Decentralize.TV Join the freeÂ NaturalNews.com email newsletterÂ to stay alerted about breaking news each day.

Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America. God bless free speech. ### Follow my podcasts, interviews, articles and social media posts on: Twitter:Â https://twitter.com/HealthRanger Brighteon.social:Â Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger Brighteon.io:Â Brighteon.io/healthranger Telegram:Â t.me/RealHealthRanger Brighteon.com:Â Brighteon.com/channels/HRreport Rumble:Â Rumble.com/c/HealthRangerReport Substack:Â HealthRanger.substack.com Banned.video:Â Banned.video/channel/mike-adams Bastyon:Â https://bastyon.com/healthranger Gettr:Â GETTR.com/user/healthranger BitChute:Â Bitchute.com/channel/9EB8glubb0Ns/ Clouthub:Â app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/naturalnews/posts My music with MP3 downloads and music videos:Â music.Brighteon.com Watch my 100+ interviews on decentralization and freedom at Decentralize.TV Join the freeÂ NaturalNews.com email newsletterÂ to stay alerted about breaking news each day. Download my current audio books -- including Ghost World, Survival Nutrition, The Global Reset Survival Guide and The Contagious Mind -- at: https://Audiobooks.NaturalNews.com/ Download my popular audio book, "Resilient Prepping" atÂ ResilientPrepping.comÂ - it teaches you how to survive the total collapse of civilization and the loss of both the power grid and combustion engines. - Media outlets (CNN, NYT, WaPo, Fox News) - Universities (Harvard, Stanford, UC Berkeley) - Payment processors (PayPal, Stripe, Venmo) - Wikipedia & "Fact-Checkers" (PolitiFact, Snopes, NewsGuard) Exception: Small, niche platforms (e.g., a private Christian forum or a local hobbyist message board) would not be subject to these rules. 2. Absolute Ban on Viewpoint Discrimination The law would explicitly protect the following categories of speech: - Political speech (pro-Trump, anti-Biden, socialist, libertarianâall views) - Medical & scientific speech (vaccine criticism, natural cures, COVID origins, bioweapons discussions, psychiatric drugs) - Religious speech (Christian, Muslim, Jewish, atheistâno blasphemy bans) - Anti-government speech (criticism of the FBI, CIA, WHO, WEF, etc.) - Economic & financial speech (Bitcoin, gold, criticism of the Federal Reserve) - Historical & cultural speech (debates on slavery, WWII, 9/11, JFK assassination) Whatâs NOT protected? ? Direct incitement to violence ("Go kill [person] at [location]") ? True threats ("Iâm going to bomb [place]") ? Child pornography & exploitation ? Doxxing & harassment (releasing private info to encourage stalking) 3. $1 Billion Per Day Fines for Censorship Violations Algorithmic suppression? $1B/day. Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day. Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh? Because only existential financial consequences will force these monopolistic corporations to stop acting as government enforcers. 4. The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3.

The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America. God bless free speech. ### Follow my podcasts, interviews, articles and social media posts on: Twitter:Â https://twitter.com/HealthRanger Brighteon.social:Â Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger Brighteon.io:Â Brighteon.io/healthranger Telegram:Â t.me/RealHealthRanger Brighteon.com:Â Brighteon.com/channels/HRreport Rumble:Â Rumble.com/c/HealthRangerReport Substack:Â HealthRanger.substack.com Banned.video:Â Banned.video/channel/mike-adams Bastyon:Â https://bastyon.com/healthranger Gettr:Â GETTR.com/user/healthranger BitChute:Â Bitchute.com/channel/9EB8glubb0Ns/ Clouthub:Â app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/naturalnews/posts My music with MP3 downloads and music videos:Â music.Brighteon.com Watch my 100+ interviews on decentralization and freedom at Decentralize.TV Join the freeÂ NaturalNews.com email newsletterÂ to stay alerted about breaking news each day. Download my current audio books -- including Ghost World, Survival Nutrition, The Global Reset Survival Guide and The Contagious Mind -- at: https://Audiobooks.NaturalNews.com/ Download my popular audio book, "Resilient Prepping" atÂ ResilientPrepping.comÂ - it teaches you how to survive the total collapse of civilization and the loss of both the power grid and combustion engines. Exception: Small, niche platforms (e.g., a private Christian forum or a local hobbyist message board) would not be subject to these rules. 2. Absolute Ban on Viewpoint Discrimination The law would explicitly protect the following categories of speech: - Political speech (pro-Trump, anti-Biden, socialist, libertarianâall views) - Medical & scientific speech (vaccine criticism, natural cures, COVID origins, bioweapons discussions, psychiatric drugs) - Religious speech (Christian, Muslim, Jewish, atheistâno blasphemy bans) - Anti-government speech (criticism of the FBI, CIA, WHO, WEF, etc.) - Economic & financial speech (Bitcoin, gold, criticism of the Federal Reserve) - Historical & cultural speech (debates on slavery, WWII, 9/11, JFK assassination) Whatâs NOT protected? ? Direct incitement to violence ("Go kill [person] at [location]") ? True threats ("Iâm going to bomb [place]") ? Child pornography & exploitation ? Doxxing & harassment (releasing private info to encourage stalking) 3. $1 Billion Per Day Fines for Censorship Violations Algorithmic suppression? $1B/day. Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day. Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh? Because only existential financial consequences will force these monopolistic corporations to stop acting as government enforcers. 4. The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time.

Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America. God bless free speech. ### Follow my podcasts, interviews, articles and social media posts on: Twitter:Â https://twitter.com/HealthRanger Brighteon.social:Â Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger Brighteon.io:Â Brighteon.io/healthranger Telegram:Â t.me/RealHealthRanger Brighteon.com:Â Brighteon.com/channels/HRreport Rumble:Â Rumble.com/c/HealthRangerReport Substack:Â HealthRanger.substack.com Banned.video:Â Banned.video/channel/mike-adams Bastyon:Â https://bastyon.com/healthranger Gettr:Â GETTR.com/user/healthranger BitChute:Â Bitchute.com/channel/9EB8glubb0Ns/ Clouthub:Â app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/naturalnews/posts My music with MP3 downloads and music videos:Â music.Brighteon.com Watch my 100+ interviews on decentralization and freedom at Decentralize.TV Join the freeÂ NaturalNews.com email newsletterÂ to stay alerted about breaking news each day.

The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America. God bless free speech. ### Follow my podcasts, interviews, articles and social media posts on: Twitter:Â https://twitter.com/HealthRanger Brighteon.social:Â Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger Brighteon.io:Â Brighteon.io/healthranger Telegram:Â t.me/RealHealthRanger Brighteon.com:Â Brighteon.com/channels/HRreport Rumble:Â Rumble.com/c/HealthRangerReport Substack:Â HealthRanger.substack.com Banned.video:Â Banned.video/channel/mike-adams Bastyon:Â https://bastyon.com/healthranger Gettr:Â GETTR.com/user/healthranger BitChute:Â Bitchute.com/channel/9EB8glubb0Ns/ Clouthub:Â app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/naturalnews/posts My music with MP3 downloads and music videos:Â music.Brighteon.com Watch my 100+ interviews on decentralization and freedom at Decentralize.TV Join the freeÂ NaturalNews.com email newsletterÂ to stay alerted about breaking news each day.

Direct incitement to violence ("Go kill [person] at [location]") ? True threats ("Iâm going to bomb [place]") ? Child pornography & exploitation ? Doxxing & harassment (releasing private info to encourage stalking) 3. $1 Billion Per Day Fines for Censorship Violations Algorithmic suppression? $1B/day. Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day. Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh? Because only existential financial consequences will force these monopolistic corporations to stop acting as government enforcers. 4.

Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives.

Download my current audio books -- including Ghost World, Survival Nutrition, The Global Reset Survival Guide and The Contagious Mind -- at: https://Audiobooks.NaturalNews.com/ Download my popular audio book, "Resilient Prepping" atÂ ResilientPrepping.comÂ - it teaches you how to survive the total collapse of civilization and the loss of both the power grid and combustion engines. ? Direct incitement to violence ("Go kill [person] at [location]") ? True threats ("Iâm going to bomb [place]") ? Child pornography & exploitation ? Doxxing & harassment (releasing private info to encourage stalking) 3. $1 Billion Per Day Fines for Censorship Violations Algorithmic suppression? $1B/day. Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day. Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh? Because only existential financial consequences will force these monopolistic corporations to stop acting as government enforcers. 4. The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours.

The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America. God bless free speech. ### Follow my podcasts, interviews, articles and social media posts on: Twitter:Â https://twitter.com/HealthRanger Brighteon.social:Â Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger Brighteon.io:Â Brighteon.io/healthranger Telegram:Â t.me/RealHealthRanger Brighteon.com:Â Brighteon.com/channels/HRreport Rumble:Â Rumble.com/c/HealthRangerReport Substack:Â HealthRanger.substack.com Banned.video:Â Banned.video/channel/mike-adams Bastyon:Â https://bastyon.com/healthranger Gettr:Â GETTR.com/user/healthranger BitChute:Â Bitchute.com/channel/9EB8glubb0Ns/ Clouthub:Â app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/naturalnews/posts My music with MP3 downloads and music videos:Â music.Brighteon.com Watch my 100+ interviews on decentralization and freedom at Decentralize.TV Join the freeÂ NaturalNews.com email newsletterÂ to stay alerted about breaking news each day.

Algorithmic suppression? $1B/day. Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day.

The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America. God bless free speech. ### Follow my podcasts, interviews, articles and social media posts on: Twitter:Â https://twitter.com/HealthRanger Brighteon.social:Â Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger Brighteon.io:Â Brighteon.io/healthranger Telegram:Â t.me/RealHealthRanger Brighteon.com:Â Brighteon.com/channels/HRreport Rumble:Â Rumble.com/c/HealthRangerReport Substack:Â HealthRanger.substack.com Banned.video:Â Banned.video/channel/mike-adams Bastyon:Â https://bastyon.com/healthranger Gettr:Â GETTR.com/user/healthranger BitChute:Â Bitchute.com/channel/9EB8glubb0Ns/ Clouthub:Â app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/naturalnews/posts My music with MP3 downloads and music videos:Â music.Brighteon.com Watch my 100+ interviews on decentralization and freedom at Decentralize.TV Join the freeÂ NaturalNews.com email newsletterÂ to stay alerted about breaking news each day.

Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America. God bless free speech. ### Follow my podcasts, interviews, articles and social media posts on: Twitter:Â https://twitter.com/HealthRanger Brighteon.social:Â Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger Brighteon.io:Â Brighteon.io/healthranger Telegram:Â t.me/RealHealthRanger Brighteon.com:Â Brighteon.com/channels/HRreport Rumble:Â Rumble.com/c/HealthRangerReport Substack:Â HealthRanger.substack.com Banned.video:Â Banned.video/channel/mike-adams Bastyon:Â https://bastyon.com/healthranger Gettr:Â GETTR.com/user/healthranger BitChute:Â Bitchute.com/channel/9EB8glubb0Ns/ Clouthub:Â app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/naturalnews/posts My music with MP3 downloads and music videos:Â music.Brighteon.com Watch my 100+ interviews on decentralization and freedom at Decentralize.TV Join the freeÂ NaturalNews.com email newsletterÂ to stay alerted about breaking news each day.

Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America. God bless free speech. ### Follow my podcasts, interviews, articles and social media posts on: Twitter:Â https://twitter.com/HealthRanger Brighteon.social:Â Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger Brighteon.io:Â Brighteon.io/healthranger Telegram:Â t.me/RealHealthRanger Brighteon.com:Â Brighteon.com/channels/HRreport Rumble:Â Rumble.com/c/HealthRangerReport Substack:Â HealthRanger.substack.com Banned.video:Â Banned.video/channel/mike-adams Bastyon:Â https://bastyon.com/healthranger Gettr:Â GETTR.com/user/healthranger BitChute:Â Bitchute.com/channel/9EB8glubb0Ns/ Clouthub:Â app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/naturalnews/posts My music with MP3 downloads and music videos:Â music.Brighteon.com Watch my 100+ interviews on decentralization and freedom at Decentralize.TV Join the freeÂ NaturalNews.com email newsletterÂ to stay alerted about breaking news each day.

Download my current audio books -- including Ghost World, Survival Nutrition, The Global Reset Survival Guide and The Contagious Mind -- at: https://Audiobooks.NaturalNews.com/ Download my popular audio book, "Resilient Prepping" atÂ ResilientPrepping.comÂ - it teaches you how to survive the total collapse of civilization and the loss of both the power grid and combustion engines. - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America.

Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours.

AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads.

Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny.

Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives.

Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America. God bless free speech. ### Follow my podcasts, interviews, articles and social media posts on: Twitter:Â https://twitter.com/HealthRanger Brighteon.social:Â Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger Brighteon.io:Â Brighteon.io/healthranger Telegram:Â t.me/RealHealthRanger Brighteon.com:Â Brighteon.com/channels/HRreport Rumble:Â Rumble.com/c/HealthRangerReport Substack:Â HealthRanger.substack.com Banned.video:Â Banned.video/channel/mike-adams Bastyon:Â https://bastyon.com/healthranger Gettr:Â GETTR.com/user/healthranger BitChute:Â Bitchute.com/channel/9EB8glubb0Ns/ Clouthub:Â app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/naturalnews/posts My music with MP3 downloads and music videos:Â music.Brighteon.com Watch my 100+ interviews on decentralization and freedom at Decentralize.TV Join the freeÂ NaturalNews.com email newsletterÂ to stay alerted about breaking news each day.

Over £1.25bn in US investment has been pledged to the UK financial services sector ahead of Donald Trump's second state visit, promising thousands of new jobs and stronger trade ties. Sunday 14 September 2025 05:12, UK The UK government has announced more than £1.25bn in private US investment in the UK's financial services sector ahead of US President Donald Trump's second state visit. The new US investments are expected to create 1,800 jobs and boost benefits for millions of customers across the country, the UK government said. The deal secures £20bn in trade between the two nations - including an expected £7bn commitment from BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager. It is set to deliver more than £8bn in investment and capital commitments to the UK, with over £12bn flowing in the other direction - creating jobs and opportunities on both sides. Other companies expected to invest include PayPal, Bank of America, Citi, and S&P Global. Bank of America will create up to 1,000 new jobs in Belfast as part of its first-ever operation in Northern Ireland, the government said. Citi plans to invest £1.1bn across its UK operations, while S&P Global will create 200 permanent jobs in Manchester through a £4m investment. US court rules Trump's tariffs are illegal - but leaves them in place for now Redundancies begin at UK's largest bioethanol plant after government rejects bailout US and China extend tariffs deadline again "Strengthening ties with the US boosts our economy, creates jobs, and secures our role in global finance," Business and Trade Secretary Peter Kyle said. "These investments reflect the strength of our enduring 'golden corridor' with one of our closest trading partners, ahead of the US Presidential State Visit." Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves said that the commitment from America's leading financial institutions "demonstrates the immense potential of the UK economy", as well as "our strong relationship with the US". The UK and US agreed a "landmark" economic deal in May, which secured major tariff reductions for key sectors and protected jobs in the automotive and aerospace sectors. Discussions are ongoing with the US on a broader UK-US economic deal, aimed at increasing digital trade and strengthening supply chains. MPs urge pressure on US over tariffs ahead of Trump visit MPs have urged the government to apply maximum pressure on the US to obtain tariff relief ahead of Donald Trump's state visit. The Commons Business and Trade Committee described the upcoming visit as a crucial opportunity to push the US president to finalise the remaining terms of the economic prosperity deal. While the UK and US reached a trade agreement in June that lowered tariffs on car and aerospace exports to the US, negotiations on British steel tariffs remain unresolved, keeping them at 25%.

"We can't escape the truth that Britain now trades with its biggest partner on terms that are worse than the past, the EU has in places secured a better edge, and key sectors of our economy still face the peril of new tariffs. That means jobs hang in the balance and investment waits on certainty." The committee also called on the government to finalise agreements on aluminium and pharmaceuticals, ensuring that the terms accurately reflect the UK's supply chain dynamics and its shift toward low-carbon production.

A government spokesperson said the "special relationship" between the UK and the US "remains strong" and that "thanks to our trade deal, the UK is still the only country to have avoided 50% steel and aluminium tariffs". "We will work with the US to implement this landmark deal as soon as possible to give industry the security they need, protect vital jobs, and put more money in people's pockets," the government spokesperson said, adding, "as well as welcoming the president on this historic state visit."

London, Edinburgh, Belfast and Manchester are set to benefit from a wave of new US investment into the financial services sector, reinforcing the strength of the UK-US economic partnership ahead of next week’s Presidential State Visit. Working with America is best for Britain — and today’s announcement proves it. A total of over £1.25 billion in private sector commitments from leading US firms — including PayPal, Bank of America, Citi Bank, and S&P Global — will support job creation, drive innovation, and deliver improved services for consumers in the UK. US giants are capitalising on Britain’s leadership in financial services – expanding operations and opening new offices across the nation, with London, Edinburgh, Belfast and Manchester set to gain from a wave of skilled job creation. Bank of America is set to create up to 1,000 new jobs in Belfast, marking its first-ever operation in Northern Ireland — a major milestone that underscores the region’s growing role in global financial services. Citi Group today confirms it is investing £1.1 billion across its UK operations, including a further commitment to growing its presence in Northern Ireland where the bank is already one of the top employers in Belfast now employing over 4,000 people — firmly establishing Belfast as a major technology powerhouse. BlackRock are celebrating the opening of their new Edinburgh office this week, which will see their 800-strong footprint nearly double, as part of their multi-billion dollar investment into the UK. In Manchester, S&P Global are investing over £4 million into their Manchester offices which will support 200 permanent jobs to boost their nearly 3,000-strong UK workforce. Business and Trade Secretary Peter Kyle said: Today’s announcements reinforce the UK’s position as the world’s leading investment destination. Our financial services sector is at the heart of a modern, dynamic Industrial Strategy. Strengthening ties with the US boosts our economy, creates jobs, and secures our role in global finance, delivering on our Plan for Change. These investments reflect the strength of our enduring ‘golden corridor’ with one of our closest trading partners, ahead of the US Presidential State Visit. This marks a significant vote of confidence in the UK’s position as a global financial hub and in the government’s plan to make Britain the best place in the world to invest — a vision underpinned by the UK’s Modern Industrial Strategy, which is driving investment into priority sectors like financial services. These investments highlight the enduring value of the transatlantic relationship — a cornerstone of shared prosperity that supports millions of jobs and drives growth in every region. Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves said: This commitment from America’s leading financial institutions demonstrates the immense potential of the UK economy, our strong relationship with the US and the confidence global investors have in our Plan for Change, which is making the UK the best place in the world to invest and do business. These investments will create thousands of high-skilled jobs from Belfast to Edinburgh, kickstarting the growth that is essential to putting money in working people’s pockets across every part of the United Kingdom. Broadridge is making major investments into their new London office, further strengthening its UK presence and deepening transatlantic ties in financial services. As part of the UK’s expanding fintech and digital innovation sector, PayPal is announcing a £150m investment in product innovations and growth that will benefit customers throughout the UK, reinforcing Britain’s position as a key market for the brand globally. Jane Fraser, Citi Group CEO said: Citi’s commitment to the UK runs deep. This is home to many of our most senior leaders and nearly 14,000 colleagues across London, Belfast, Edinburgh and Jersey. We’re proud to be serving 85% of the FTSE 100 and to have stood beside UK companies through every market cycle, raising capital, financing growth and helping them compete on the world stage. The UK isn’t simply one of our largest markets; it is core to Citi’s foundation as a truly global bank. The UK-US investment relationship has never been stronger, with over £1.2 trillion invested in each other’s countries at the end of 2023. These new investment announcements are accompanied by new significant commitments by financial companies to ramp up their commercial activity and capital flows between our two economies in the coming years. Blackrock is expecting to allocate over £7 billion to the UK market next year on behalf of clients, and is investing £500 million into enterprise data centres across the country. Rothesay is planning to double its investment in the US (by £7 billion) over the next few years, and OakNorth is committing to increased capital and lending of over £3.5 billion to support its US operations. British banks are expanding their US footprint; Barclays alone has deployed over $2 trillion in capital across the US in 2024 and continues to play a pivotal role in strengthening UK-US investment ties. The bank has an ambition to double this amount over the next decade, expanding its footprint and supporting growth across sectors. All in all, that will see investment and capital commitments of over £8 billion coming to the UK, and over £12 billion going the other way, creating jobs and opportunity in both countries. Earlier this year, the Chancellor launched the Financial Services Growth and Competitiveness Strategy, which included financial services as a high growth sector, signifying the UK’s commitment improving financial regulations and driving investment and skilled jobs into the UK. The UK and US agreed an Economic Prosperity Deal which secured major tariff reductions for key sectors and protected jobs in the automotive and aerospace sector. Discussions continue with the US on a wider UK-US Economic Deal which will look at increasing digital trade, strengthen supply chains and boost access for our world-leading services companies. Today’s announcements mark the start of a week of activity to strengthen economic ties between the US and UK. Further announcements reflected in the totals above are expected this week: Please see below for a list of all the investments announced today. Bank of America is set to create up to 1,000 new jobs in Belfast, marking its first-ever operation in Northern Ireland — a major milestone that underscores the region’s growing role in global financial services. Brian Moynihan, Chair and CEO of Bank of America, said: At Bank of America we are focused on helping our clients advance economic opportunity and prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic. The early US-UK trade agreement that the President and the Prime Minister began discussing in February has provided the business community with the certainty and framework it needs to strengthen transatlantic commerce.

Traders place the odds of a rate cut at the next Federal Reserve meeting at over 90%, but not everyone is happy about the prospect of easy money. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. If you’re following the markets, you’ll know the Federal Reserve is poised to cut interest rates next week to stimulate a lagging economy. While most crypto traders are jumping for joy at the thought of fresh liquidity entering the system, not everybody’s happy. The upcoming rate cut, according to some, could have a catastrophic effect on the global economy. Economist, investor, and everybody’s favorite goldbug Peter Schiff did not mince his words, calling a rate cut a “huge mistake” in a post shared on X. As crypto traders gear up for a potentially bullish period, Schiff warns of serious consequences that will gravely impact the economy. His commentary is blunt. He points to recent price moves in gold and silver as clear evidence that the rate cut is being telegraphed by the markets. Schiff wrote: “Silver just traded above $42. Gold is poised to break to a new record high. I think the precious metals are getting ready to melt up. This is an unmistakable market signal that the Fed’s upcoming rate cut is a huge mistake.” He argues that the decision will set off a string of cuts and a return to aggressive quantitative easing, potentially with “definitive yield curve control.” Schiff claims the U.S. dollar could lose its reserve currency status as confidence in the Fed’s judgment wavers. Peter Schiff has long pushed the view that overly easy policy will stoke inflation and put the dollar at risk. He believes that today’s environment represents the Fed’s most damaging error yet. “Ever since Alan Greenspan rescued the stock market after the 1987 crash, the Fed has made a series of increasingly bad monetary policy mistakes.” Risk-on asset traders welcome rate cuts with open arms. Lower interest rates flood markets with cheap capital and loosen financial conditions, which typically results in higher prices for volatile assets like crypto. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoins tend to rally as liquidity improves, triggering a wave of buying and bullish sentiment. The CME’s FedWatch tool shows market participants almost unanimously expect a cut (93.4%), with bets on both Bitcoin and altcoins accelerating into the meeting. Lower rates mean money can move out of safe havens and into riskier bets, which is another reason Schiff is opposed to the cut. In plain language: Traders want easy money. Recent cycles show crypto runs higher whenever the Fed loosens policy, and traders are already calling for a new bull market as expectations for rate cuts hit fever pitch. While Schiff sounds the alarm, many respected analysts, including teams at Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, and a 107-economist Reuters survey, see the rate cut as a necessary step to support the weakening labor market and prevent recession. Goldman’s chief economist expects a series of small cuts, noting softer employment data and muted inflation as justification for easing. Others warn that cutting rates too fast could actually push inflation higher or weaken the dollar, backing some of Schiff’s concerns. Jefferies strategist David Zervos suggested the Fed might need a deep 75 basis point cut, though he also cautioned that easy money could ultimately hurt by driving up prices and weakening currency fundamentals. The upcoming Fed rate cut is a flashpoint. Schiff says it risks disaster, spiraling cuts, runaway inflation, and a weaker dollar. Crypto traders, though, are celebrating the prospect of more easy money and the next phase in the bull run. The broader economist community remains split, weighing soft employment against inflation risk.

Title: 3 Reasons The Growth Of DeFi Is Lagging Among Institutions
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/09/13/3-reasons-the-growth-of-defi-is-lagging-among-institutions/

BySean Stein Smith, Contributor. Even as the cryptoasset ecosystem grows, market capitalizations remain near all-time-highs, and TradFi institutions continue to deploy an array of products and services one subset of the crypto ecosystem is still looking to recover 2021 and 2022 excitement: decentralized finance. This may come as a surprise to some crypto-native investors, as the total value locked has risen to a new record of $130 billion according to research by DeFiLlama. These deposits, placed and managed in a blockchain or DeFi protocol have more than doubled since April, and reflect the overall shift in both policy directives and investor sentiment. Ironically enough the growth and deposits in the DeFi sector continue to trend toward centralization, with three (3) players dominating the space. Aave possess a TVL of more than $68 billion, which is the largest of any DeFi lending protocol, leverages a pool-based lending protocol, and in August launched an institutional platform allowing larger investors to participate. Morpho and JustLend round out the top players in the DeFi landscape, but both have substantially lower TVL’s and – in some cases – more limited offerings. In spite of these record levels of deposits, and positive tailwinds, institutional adoption and utilization of DeFi continues to lag. JPMorgan, itself one of the most innovative TradFi banks via its Kinexys (formerly Onyx) suite of on-chain products and services, has recently noted the disappointing progress for both DeFi and tokenized assets by institutions in the TradFi space. Notably, the bulk of the activity and growth in DeFi has come from retail and/or crypto-native institutions. Let’s take a look at a few reasons why DeFi, despite its growth and record deposits, still needs better regulation. A common issue that continues to stall wider utilization of DeFi across broader areas of the economy – both crypto-native and TradFi – are issues related to interoperability and liquidity across multiple chains. While the most common manifestation of this takes the form of differing valuations for some tokens when analyzed across chains, and this includes valuations for stablecoins, there are other issues that DeFi needs to address. Firstly, the traceability and transparency of transactions, tokens, and tokenized assets as they move across chains is something that will need to be standardized and improved upon to obtain more institutional adoption. Additionally, although consumers have been the primary drivers of this recent uptick in DeFi TVL, institutions of all kinds need to have absolute confidence that transactions, payments, and confirmations can occur as seamlessly as occur using current payment rails and options. Much like how bitcoin has achieved and maintained higher price levels, obtained policy victories, and generated increased interest once firms like Blackrock entered the space via spot ETF products, DeFi will need TradFi firms to embrace DeFi-first options to generate similar growth. An ongoing issue in the wider cryptoasset ecosystem, not limited to the DeFi space, is the still-evolving standards and best practices related to auditing and assurance connected to blockchain, cryptoassets, and the smart contracts that power many of the Layer 2, Web 3, and more innovative use cases that have deployed in the 2024-2025 timespan. With cybercriminals already having stolen over $2 billion in 2025, according to DeFiLlama, a 77% increase from 2024, the weaknesses of the DeFi ecosystem continue to prove lucrative for hackers and other criminal elements. While the smart contract space has certainly evolved substantially since initially introduced, with many organizations leveraging these applications, the fact remains that the standards, transparency, and auditability of smart contracts is a work in progress. This status provides several obstacles to institutional adoption of DeFi. First, if organizations cannot trust smart contracts – or at least trust that issues can be remediated in a timely manner – customers and regulators will not be on board either. Secondly, especially for publicly traded organizations, if auditability, record-keeping, and traceability remain questions, bodies such as the SEC (even under the new pro-crypto regime) will be hesitant to approve related projects. In short, the very smart contracts that power DeFi at the most important level continue to prove a point of weakness. Last but not least the DeFi sector – even with nearly $200 billion in total value locked – remains a miniscule fraction of the overall lending market and financial ecosystem. For contextual purposes, JP Morgan Chase reported daily payment processing volume of $10 trillion in a recent earnings release. Crypto and crypto-adjacent products and services have experienced significant growth, adoption, and acceptance since the last bear market kicked off by the collapse of FTX, but still are – for all intents and purposes – a fringe component of the financial world. To address this, in addition to the points raised above, are directly related to the ability of DeFi protocols to scale to meet customer demand as well as addressing the reliability, reversibility, and potential hackability of smart contracts underpinning the protocols. A critical component of this process will entail both working the TradFi financial sector as well as improving regulatory-mandated mechanisms such as KYC and AML safeguards. As policy continues to pivot and produce tailwinds versus headwinds it is reasonable to assume this will occur, but investors and policymakers should remain cautious before pushing for widespread utilization is the DeFi infrastructure is not yet prepared. DeFi continues to grow, but work remains to attract institutional buy-in.

Title: Neuralink, Elon Musk, and the Race to Put Chips Into Our Brains

By Darren Loucaides T here’s a 3D hand on a black screen. J. Galen Buckwalter concentrates on the image, trying to move one of the virtual hand’s fingers — with his mind. For more than 50 years, Buckwalter hasn’t felt his fingers after breaking his neck in an accident as a teenager. But today, thanks to a research lab at California Institute of Technology (Caltech) that implanted him with a brain computer interface (BCI), Buckwalter is a pioneer exploring the frontiers of brain science. Buckwalter only needed a couple of sessions to master the control of a computer cursor — some participants needed much longer. Now he attempts to move two fingers and a thumb. A large blue dot slides back and forth over the virtual index finger as he tries to coax it to life. Eventually he can move all three digits — and can actually feel the virtual fingers he’s trying to move. “That was the ‘holy shit’ moment, that this really feels like my hand,” Buckwalter says with a grin in a video call. It may seem like a small step, but this was a giant leap for Buckwalter, 69, the self-proclaimed “neuronaut.” The Caltech lab where Buckwalter is a participant is run by Richard Andersen, 74, one of the world’s foremost neuroscientists who has been working on implants for decades. His lab is currently studying five humans with long-term brain implants. These participants have moved objects with robotic arms, operated semi-autonomous cars as part of an experiment in collaboration with Ford, and even felt natural touch again. Brain implants are very much part of the popular imagination right now — the hit show Severance fictionalizes a worst-case scenario for the technology — and Elon Musk’s BCI company Neuralink has swallowed most of the news attention, like the videos of Neuralink’s participants playing video games and moving robotic arms. But Neuralink’s headline-grabbing work builds on the painstaking achievements of research labs like Caltech’s. “The BCI companies of today are standing on the shoulders of academic giants who have been developing BCIs for decades,” says Rajesh Rao, co-director of the Center for Neurotechnology at the University of Washington. Editor’s picks The 250 Greatest Albums of the 21st Century So Far The 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time 100 Best Movies of the 21st Century Musk’s goal for his company also diverges from his academic forbearers. The world’s richest man is explicitly focused on “enhancement” — his sci-fi dream is to turn BCIs into mass products for able-bodied people, merging our brains with computers. While academic labs like Caltech are focused on better understanding the brain so they can help people with conditions like Buckwalter’s, Musk wants to give people superhuman vision and total recall: “If it’s extremely safe, and you can have superhuman abilities, and let’s say you can upload your memories, so you wouldn’t lose memories, then I think probably a lot of people would choose to have it,” he told podcaster Lex Fridman last year. “It would supersede the cellphone, for example.” Neuralink’s staff has basically said that they don’t need to understand how the brain works to roll out this cyborg future. To those in the know, this seems short-sighted. “New knowledge of how the brain works leads to more advanced neural prosthetics,” as Andersen says. Musk’s pushy approach also risks setting back this work at a crucial moment, according to others in the field. Related Content Why Fascists Hate Critical Thinking Graham Linehan’s Second Arrest Fuels Backlash to U.K.’s Online Speech Laws Elon Musk Appears to Be Completely Addicted to Anime Gooner AI Slop Grok Claims It Was Briefly Suspended From X After Accusing Israel of Genocide “The top leaders at Neuralink in place right now are definitely trying to do the right thing,” one expert, who is in touch with Neuralink staff and asked to remain anonymous, tells Rolling Stone. But they point to “crazy pressure from the top,” while raising some of the same concerns highlighted in a 2020 STAT News investigation that reported a “chaotic internal culture” and a Reuters 2023 report on “tensions inside Neuralink over development pace.” Neuralink and Musk did not respond to a detailed list of questions from Rolling Stone. Current individual employees also did not respond to requests for comment for this piece. With Musk’s recent cost-cutting role in government — already linked to the firing of those in the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), including some staff overseeing Neuralink’s clinical trial applications — there’s more attention on the company than ever, with some wondering if the guardrails have come off. IN JULY 2019, MUSK strode onstage in San Francisco wearing a suit with a white shirt, no tie, to make his first presentation about Neuralink. While the first human volunteers would be paralyzed patients, the ultimate goal was to avoid mankind being “left behind” by advancing tech, namely AI. “This is going to sound pretty weird,” he said, shoulders hunched, but the objective was to achieve “symbiosis with artificial intelligence.” He added: “This is extremely important.” The following year, in an interview with Joe Rogan, Musk made an even bigger claim: Implantees would be able to “save state” like in a video game, enabling someone to “restore that state into a biological being if you wanted to in the future.” Despite Musk’s interventions bringing the field an unprecedented level of prominence in the media, brain implants have been around for decades. In the 1960s, neurophysiologist José Delgado implanted bulls with wireless devices to stop them in their tracks as they charged toward him. In 1973, University of California in Los Angeles’ Jacques Vidal, who coined the term “brain-computer interface,” used noninvasive electroencephalograms (EEGs) — small sensors applied to the scalp — to allow participants to control a cursor-like object on a computer screen. There followed considerable public blowback over fears of mind control, particularly as the Soviet Union conducted its own research. Only in the 1990s did the pace pick up again, including the development of the microelectrode platform called the Utah Array. In 2004, Matt Nagle became the first paralyzed person to be implanted with the Utah Array, enabling him to move a cursor, check email, operate a TV, and open and close a prosthetic hand. The Utah Array would become the gold standard for BCIs, used in many academic research labs. Musk wanted to popularize a different kind of brain implant — one that was wireless. In 2016, Musk founded Neuralink with eight engineers and neuroscientists, including Philip Sabes, a professor emeritus at University of California, San Francisco (UCSF); Sabes had been working at UCSF on thin-film electrodes that could be robotically implanted at the micron-scale using a “sewing machine.” Although Neuralink was registered as a “medical research” company, a key goal was human-AI integration, as later specified by Musk in a conversation with Wait But Why blogger and author Tim Urban. At times in the years since Neuralink’s founding, Musk was reportedly frustrated by the company’s progress. Before Neuralink could work with humans, it had to conduct extensive trials with animals. To begin with, this mostly involved rats. In his 2019 presentation, Musk revealed Neuralink had started testing primates, too. “A monkey has been able to control the computer with his brain. Just FYI,” he claimed. Accusations of animal cruelty led to a federal probe in 2022 for violations of the Animal Welfare Act. According to Reuters, which cited documents and interviews with 20 current and former employees, excessive pressure and rushed timelines resulted in botched experiments causing the deaths of at least 1,500 animals — including monkeys, sheep, and pigs — over a four-year period. Neuralink denied the animal cruelty claims at the time. (In July 2023, the federal probe found no breaches of animal welfare rules apart from a 2019 incident the company had already reported.) In 2023, Neuralink got permission from the FDA to begin testing with humans. That year, Neuralink raised around $325 million from investors who valued the company in excess of $3 billion. In 2024, Neuralink announced its first human participant: Noland Arbaugh, a thirtysomething quadriplegic, was implanted with a wireless chip smaller and supposedly more powerful than the Utah Array. Although far less invasive than procedures at labs like Caltech’s, Neuralink’s implant still involved a small part of the skull being permanently removed; the implant sits in this space with a flap of skin on top. A neurosurgeon oversaw the robot’s surgery, but the company’s ultimate goal is to fully automate the procedure. With practice, Arbaugh was able to use the BCI to control a computer cursor and play video games. But there were problems. Only a month after his surgery, around 85 percent of the threads implanted in his brain had come loose. In August 2024, it announced a second participant, implanted with a more advanced chip that enabled him to design 3D objects using computer-aided design software. In late January, Neuralink posted a clip of a robotic arm writing on a whiteboard, supposedly under the control of a third participant, and on April 27, Musk shared a video of this participant, who has ALS and is unable to speak, describing how his implant had enabled him to communicate again via a computer. More recently, the number of patients has accelerated, with Neuralink claiming it now has nine human participants. Like studies at academic labs, all of Neuralink’s participants are paralyzed. While Musk has more recently hailed the potential for Neuralink to restore a person’s ability to walk or even cure their dementia, he has more often alluded to a different objective. During an hourlong presentation in July 2024, Musk claimed that anyone with his implants would soon be able to communicate faster than a person with a fully functional body. “We want to give people superpowers,” he said. SO FAR, NEURALINK HAS LARGELY built on achievements already demonstrated in the field — cursor control, click control, and robotic arm control. “How I would see it is they’re basically checking off these milestones,” the expert in touch with Neuralink staff tells Rolling Stone. “Everything Musk does attracts an outsized level of attention…. I think most scientists prefer other people to measure the significance of their work, whereas Musk is doing the opposite, and labeling everything he’s done as brand new and significant.” There are unique elements to Neuralink’s BCI, such as the robotic surgery used to implant it, as well as the wireless technology. But other companies use even less-invasive methods. Precision Neuroscience, founded by a former Neuralink co-founder, has developed a flexible electrode array thinner than a human hair, which the company describes as “minimally invasive.” Synchron is testing a device that’s inserted into the brain through a blood vessel; the company also uses a generative chat feature powered by OpenAI to assist relevant participants with communication (it was recently reported that OpenAI co-founder Sam Altman is raising funds for a BCI startup that would compete with Neuralink). And the method of implanting electrode threads into the cortex was first developed by Philip Sabes while he worked at UCSF, before he left and co-founded Neuralink. There are also downsides to going wireless. Caltech postdoc David Bjånes notes that, while Neuralink’s device records neurons from more channels than, for example, the 384 channels provided by six Utah Arrays as in Buckwalter’s case, it currently only records from one brain area — by contrast, Caltech’s devices record from five brain areas concurrently. With different participants having implants in different parts of the brain, the researchers have a more holistic view of how the brain performs various functions. Neuralink’s device also transmits a compressed version of its brain signal due to bandwidth limitations from being wireless, whereas Caltech can record uncompressed, high bandwidth broadband signals on all their channels. “As a scientist, I am not willing to sacrifice signal if I don’t have to,” Bjånes says. “A wired solution that gives me as much signal as possible — I’m going to choose that every time over another technology.” For patients, there’s a huge advantage to a wireless BCI, but that comes at the expense of gaining new knowledge about the brain that can help future patients. “I think the wireless technology will get there,” Bjånes says. “It just is not quite mature enough.” Previously, Neuralink has been pilloried for its lack of transparency. After Musk announced on X in January 2024 that the first human had been implanted with Neuralink’s device, experts in the field and former regulatory staff expressed concerns at the piecemeal doling out of information, with specific criticism for not registering its trial at the National Institute of Health’s website ClinicalTrials.gov — a common practice even for so-called “early feasibility” devices like Neuralink’s. Medical ethicists described Neuralink’s and Musk’s approach as “science by press release.” In May, Neuralink did register on ClinicalTrials.gov and has since shared more details of its studies. But it’s still unclear, for example, how its robotic surgery exactly works, at least to anyone outside Neuralink. And as Musk continues to make bold claims in an increasingly competitive field, experts note that, given past concerns raised by Neuralink employees, something could go wrong and set the field back years both in terms of willing participants and private investors due to the long shadow Musk casts. “The ‘move fast, break things, and fix it later’ philosophy of Big Tech is going to be disastrous if applied to BCIs,” says Rajesh Rao, the University of Washington professor, who argues that commercial companies like Neuralink should embed ethicists in their teams. A former Neuralink engineer tells Rolling Stone it is “hard for anything to advance super fast for a class 3 medical device,” noting that every advance takes “immense effort,” testing and preclinical/clinical trials. And they claim the company moves fast “without compromising safety.” Even so, concerns about Neuralink’s impact on the field only grew in the wake of Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) instigating mass layoffs of federal staff, some directly impacting Neuralink. This sparked concern that guardrails around approval for Neuralink trials had been removed. Phyllis Fong, the USDA’s longtime inspector general who launched the ongoing probe into Neuralink for alleged animal cruelty, was forced out of her job in January. In mid-February, 20 staff members in the FDA office of neurological and physical medicine devices, including several who oversaw Neuralink, were also fired. (Shortly after layoffs in the FDA, hundreds were reportedly asked to rejoin, though it is unclear if any staff specifically reviewing Neuralink were rehired.) The cuts included reviewers overseeing clinical-trial applications by Neuralink and other companies creating BCI devices. (In April, Neuralink also falsely self-certified as a “small disadvantaged business” on a federal filing, qualifying Musk’s company for funding aimed at promoting racial and ethnic diversity. As of this summer, there wasn’t evidence that they’d received the funding.) In response to criticism that Musk was removing officials responsible for regulating his companies, the White House insisted at the time that he had pledged to avoid conflicts of interest. BUCKWALTER WAS ONLY 17 when he leapt from high rocks into the Susquehanna River in Pennsylvania, breaking his neck and doing irreparable damage to his spinal cord. He spent a year in a state hospital for what were then called “crippled” children. While some of the other injured kids were in and out within a month, Buckwalter’s convalescence was slow. “I kind of had to stumble my way along,” he says. “It was the dark ages of rehabilitation medicine.” But Buckwalter did find his way, and he has gone on to live a full life by any measure. He ended up being a researcher for 15 years, writing a paper on estrogen replacement therapy for women diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease that is still cited often, as is his groundbreaking research into so-called “mommy brain” cognition during pregnancy, which landed him on morning news shows in the 1990s. Buckwalter conducted initial research and wrote the matching algorithm for the dating website eHarmony, founded in 2000. For a quarter century, Buckwalter has also been the frontman of a David Bowie-inspired rock band called Siggy, which still performs live. Many quadriplegics don’t make it to Buckwalter’s age. “Fifty years post-spinal cord injury is a pretty small population of folks,” he says. In 2023, a friend and colleague who had a neuroscience Ph.D. from Caltech told him about a lab at the private university in Pasadena researching brain implants. The surgery itself involved cutting into Buckwalter’s skull to install six Utah arrays. The implants are designed to both “read” and “write”: The electrodes record neurons firing as well as stimulating activity. Buckwalter’s pioneering case also involves the world’s first chronic implant inside the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, where high-level reasoning and possible participation in language takes place. Even in the inherently more cautious academic sphere of BCIs, there are challenges for participants like Buckwalter. After falling earlier this year, he fractured his femur and damaged one of the pedestals protruding from his head, and it has taken Caltech’s neurosurgeons some time to bring the affected arrays online. He has also belatedly realized he doesn’t technically have ownership of his data — the information gathered from his brain by the arrays during lab work with Caltech — which complicates a proposed collaboration over the creation of a virtual clone of Buckwalter with a former student of his, Thomas Parsons, working in AI at Arizona State University. Parsons has been scraping anything Buckwalter has ever written or said on record to integrate into a large language model. This plan is to have Buckwalter’s BCI interact directly with his virtual clone, offering unprecedented insights into the holy grail of neuroscience — the mechanics of consciousness itself. But if Buckwalter can’t access his Caltech data, the ambitious project may be imperilled. Buckwalter and other brain implantees are now trying to collectively organize behind a so-called BCI Pioneers manifesto, and are working with an attorney on a consent form addendum for all brain implant procedures. Buckwalter has proposed the catchy slogan: “My brain, my data.” THERE ARE MAJOR DIFFERENCES between academic researchers and commercial companies — and yet the fates of both are bound together. “The failure and success of any one of us is all of ours,” Bjånes says. One way of warding off this danger could be by greater collaboration between companies and academic research labs. One company, Onward Medical, collaborates with Rao’s center at the University of Washington, and another called Blackrock Neurotech, which produces the Utah Array, collaborates with multiple research labs. Neuralink has made no such collaboration public. Experts speaking to Rolling Stone say Neuralink clearly has an important role to play in the field’s future, both in raising public awareness and the transformative potential of the company achieving its goal of implanting thousands of humans. “Neuralink’s strength is in its ability to commercialize such an intricate piece of tech,” says the ex-Neuralink engineer. “Sure, this has existed in labs, but no one can feasibly bring it to market at scale.” Currently only a handful of participants are signed up to each academic research lab. If Neuralink’s work means there are many more participants with BCIs, and Musk releases the API to enable other researchers to access the data, it could be a game changer. Given Neuralink’s relative opacity, that seems unlikely. At the same time, Musk continues to make fantastical-sounding claims. Last year he predicted that within two decades, hundreds of millions of people would be using Neuralink’s implants. He envisions a future in which his company inaugurates superhuman cyborgs — a techno-dystopian “symbiosis” with machines and artificial intelligence. AI has an important role to play with BCIs, particularly via the use of large language models (LLM) to assist the decoding of speech, learning an individual’s repeated patterns of speech and generating a voice that sounds like their own. AI has also helped patients communicate as with rival company Synchron’s OpenAI-powered generative chat feature. Musk’s leading contribution to the AI field so far has been Grok. But his X-native chatbot has repeatedly caused controversy, whether ranting about “white genocide” in South Africa or praising Hitler, and replying to users with antisemitic comments. There may be reason to fear what Musk could do with experimental brain tech after seeing how Grok has turned out. Meanwhile, Musk’s big claims about brain implants’ potential could end up triggering a public backlash as was seen in the 1970s. They even highlight a rift in President Trump’s coalition between the tech right and those wary of Big Tech. Former top Trump strategist Steve Bannon, a staunch critic of Musk’s transhumanist philosophy, warned in January that within 10 years, brain chips would threaten humanity as we know it, as people could face a dilemma over whether to enhance themselves or fall behind peers.

Then He Smuggled $500 Million Worth of Cocaine in One Night UCSF’s Edward Chang sees his lab’s place in the field as distinct from many commercial companies. “My goal, ultimately, is quite different,” he says. Instead of Musk’s sci-fi enhancement dream, Chang’s research seeks new knowledge that can relieve the suffering of his patients, and even more importantly, “trying to understand who we are as humans,” he says. “I think ultimately, that’s a much more ambitious goal than enhancement.” Using BCIs to advance our understanding of the brain comes at a moment when artificial intelligence also poses existential questions for humanity. As Chang says, “I personally think that it’s more important than ever, actually, to understand what makes us human.” photographs in illustration by JIM WATSON/AFP/Getty Images; Adobe Stock, 2 We want to hear it.

Solana (SOL) has solidified its position among the world’s largest cryptocurrencies, surpassing Binance Coin (BNB) to secure the fifth spot by market capitalization. As of September 12, 2025, SOL trades at $ 237.90, giving it a market capitalization of $126.4 billion. The rally marks a 6.8% gain in the past 24 hours and over 15% weekly growth, driven by surging institutional interest and strong on-chain activity. Analysts stress three key catalysts behind Solana’s momentum: Nasdaq’s approval of a Solana-focused listing, growing speculation over spot ETFs, and continuous network upgrades that strengthen its position as Ethereum’s closest competitor. A major driver of the rally was Galaxy Digital’s reported purchase of 2.31 million SOL tokens worth nearly $536 million within 24 hours. Blockchain data confirms transfers from Binance, Coinbase, and Bybit to Galaxy-controlled wallets, fueling speculation that the firm is aggressively backing Solana’s growth. This move follows Galaxy’s leadership in a $1.65 billion private placement for Forward Industries (NASDAQ: FORD), which is transitioning into a Solana-focused digital asset treasury. Forward’s stock soared 135% in five days, proving investor excitement. Galaxy CEO Mike Novogratz declared the start of a “Solana Season,” citing regulatory progress, ETF optimism, and Solana’s unmatched scalability as reasons for the aggressive accumulation. ETF speculation continues to boost Solana’s appeal. Reports suggest a 90% chance of a Solana ETF approval by late 2025, with applications from VanEck and Fidelity already in review. With staking yields around 7%, analysts believe Solana is well-positioned to attract yield-focused ETF structures. Meanwhile, Solana’s network fundamentals remain robust. August data shows 58 million monthly active users and $15.3 billion in total value locked (TVL), fueled by activity across DeFi, NFTs, and memecoins. Recent upgrades, including the Alpenglow upgrade and the upcoming Firedancer client, promise greater scalability and reduced congestion. With institutional capital flooding in, ETF approvals on the horizon, and technical upgrades boosting performance, Solana’s momentum shows no signs of slowing. Analysts now eye potential price targets between $300 and $400 in the coming months if bullish conditions persist. Cover image from ChatGPT, SOLUSD For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.
