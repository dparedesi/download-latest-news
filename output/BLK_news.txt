Skip to comments. Posted on 08/16/2025 12:03:12 PM PDT by DFG The World Economic Forum closed an investigation on its founder Klaus Schwab on Friday, clearing him of any wrongdoing, and appointed BlackRock (BLK.N), opens new tab CEO Larry Fink and Roche Holding's (ROG.S), opens new tab vice-chair Andre Hoffmann as interim co-chairs of its board. The Geneva-based organisation had launched an investigation in April into 87-year-old Schwab following a whistleblower letter alleging misconduct. The probe was announced a day after Schwab resigned as chairman. The forum at that time did not say why he was quitting. For decades, Schwab has been the face of the WEF's annual gathering of business and political leaders in the Swiss mountain resort of Davos, which has become a symbol of globalisation. The WEF said on Friday that its board had completed an investigation into allegations raised by anonymous whistleblowers against Schwab and found there was no evidence of material wrongdoing by him. WEF also did not find any misconduct by Schwab's wife and former assistant, Hilde Schwab. "Minor irregularities, stemming from blurred lines between personal contributions and forum operations, reflect deep commitment rather than intent of misconduct," WEF said. -- snip -- In a statement posted on the WEF website, newly appointed co-chairs Fink and Hoffman said they were honored to take on the leadership role on an interim basis and looked forward to reinventing and strengthening the organisation. WEF's Davos gathering has in recent years drawn criticism from opponents on both left and right as an elitist talking shop detached from lives of ordinary people.

Title: Plastics Manufacturing At Crossroads: Pivot To Lead Or Lose
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/trondarneundheim/2025/08/16/plastics-manufacturing-at-crossroads-pivot-to-lead-or-lose/

ByTrond Arne Undheim ByTrond Arne Undheim, Contributor. The latest UN plastics treaty collapse underscored what markets already know: a $400 billion stranded asset risk that forward-thinking petrochemical leaders must now confront strategically. While legacy producers viewed blocking production caps as protecting industry interests, market forces don‚Äôt wait for diplomatic consensus. The transition window for plastics producers and pushers alike is narrowing, and who controls that transformation will determine market winners for the next three decades. The plastics industry faces mounting exposure across financial, regulatory, and reputational dimensions. The data reveals systemic vulnerabilities: only 9% of plastic waste is successfully recycled globally, microplastics now contaminate human blood as confirmed by groundbreaking research, and current projections show plastic production almost tripling by 2060. Meanwhile, oil majors increasingly depend on petrochemicals as their primary growth hedge against transport electrification. This isn't environmental ideology‚Äîit's risk management. Carbon Tracker has identified $400 billion in planned petrochemical expansions built on assumptions of infinite demand growth, while regulatory reality tells a different story. The EU's PPWR mandates 30% recycled content by 2030, California's SB 54 bans non-recyclable packaging, and consumer sentiment has shifted decisively toward sustainability metrics in purchasing decisions. The strategic question isn‚Äôt whether to change course, but how to optimize portfolio transition while preserving long-term revenue streams. Legacy models that expose firms to mounting financial, reputational, and regulatory risk need managed evolution, not overnight abandonment. Global investors are increasingly differentiating between high-risk commodity plastics and resilient specialty applications. BlackRock and LGIM now vote against directors of firms failing to address plastic-related risks. Project financing for petrochemical expansions faces enhanced ESG scrutiny, as demonstrated by investor concerns around major Gulf Coast projects. Lloyd's of London's exclusion of microplastic liability coverage signals broader insurance market caution. Firms that move first in rebalancing portfolios toward higher-value, lower-risk applications will secure cheaper access to capital. The market is rewarding strategic repositioning while penalizing commodity exposure‚Äîa trend that will only accelerate as ESG integration deepens across global finance. Strategic manufacturers are already rebalancing based on regulatory exposure and long-term demand fundamentals. Rather than wholesale abandonment, smart money is shifting toward value-preservation strategies that target virgin plastic cuts of 20% by 2027 under emerging regulations: High-value durables: Automotive, aerospace, medical, and renewable energy infrastructure applications offer better regulatory protection and margin stability than commodity packaging. PVC and polystyrene exposure: These face accelerating regulatory pressure. IKEA's aggressive phaseout‚Äîplastic packaging eliminated for new ranges in 2025, complete elimination by 2028‚Äîsignals corporate buyer behavior. Strategic exit while assets retain value makes financial sense. Multi-layer films: Major brands are abandoning these recycling-incompatible formats. PepsiCo's 2025 backtrack reveals the credibility gap‚Äîslashing virgin plastic cut targets from 20% to 2% while claiming 97% recyclable packaging by 2030. Compare to Unilever's ‚Ç¨1 billion investment in reusable packaging systems, already showing 12% cost savings in pilot markets, proving circular models can be profit centers rather than compliance costs. Engineering plastics: Specialty applications provide longer runway and higher barriers to substitution, making them natural portfolio anchors during transition. Petrochemical majors possess unique advantages in commercializing next-generation technologies. While startups develop promising innovations, established players have the balance sheets and engineering capacity to scale them globally. The technology landscape offers adjacency opportunities rather than existential threats: Carbon utilization: CO‚ÇÇ-to-chemicals technologies transform waste streams into feedstock, leveraging existing infrastructure while improving carbon footprints. LanzaTech's UK expansion in 2025 demonstrates how major players can scale these faster than venture-backed newcomers. Advanced recycling: Chemical recycling and enzyme-based depolymerization require the kind of industrial-scale deployment that suits petrochemical engineering capabilities. Carbios' enzyme facility became operational despite 2025 restructuring, while Loop Industries launched Twist resin with a 70,000-ton facility planned. Microbial manufacturing: Cemvita Factory's breakthrough in using engineered microbes to produce industrial chemicals from CO‚ÇÇ and waste streams could reach commercial scale within the decade, offering petrochemical companies new bio-based production pathways. Feedstock diversification: Bio-based and captured-carbon feedstocks expand the resource base rather than threatening it, creating opportunities for companies with processing expertise and global distribution networks. UBQ Materials' 2025 masterbatch launch exemplifies how waste streams become valuable inputs. The question isn't whether these technologies will scale‚Äîit's who will control their commercialization. First-mover advantages in licensing, partnership, and deployment could define the next industrial cycle. Global policy fragmentation creates near-term arbitrage opportunities while markets converge toward sustainability standards. Petrochemical leaders are uniquely positioned to exploit these asymmetries while building transition capabilities: Europe's strict EPR rules reward recycled content expertise. California's packaging restrictions favor mono-material innovation. Emerging markets maintain growth potential for essential applications while developed markets focus on circularity. BP's own Energy Outlook acknowledges that declining oil use in road transport is being offset by increasing petrochemical demand, but smart players are preparing for the eventual policy convergence. This fragmentation won't last indefinitely, but it provides a transition window for companies that invest now in capabilities they'll need globally later. Building circular expertise in sympathetic markets creates competitive advantages when regulations harmonize. Companies that invest now in next-generation sorting systems like TOMRA's 2025 deep learning AI for aluminum recovery will be positioned to capture value as feedstock quality requirements increase globally. BP's 2025 Energy Outlook confirms oil demand peaked in 2025 at 102 million barrels per day, with petrochemical demand offsetting transport decline but plateauing by decade's end. As global awareness of environmental justice rises, companies that proactively address community siting, health impacts, and international waste flows will preserve operating licenses and avoid costly litigation. The traditional export of difficult-to-recycle materials to developing nations creates mounting reputational and legal exposure. Forward-thinking companies are investing in domestic circular systems while partnering with international communities rather than simply relocating problems. This isn't just ethical positioning‚Äîit's risk mitigation against consumer boycotts, investor flight, and regulatory backlash as environmental justice movements gain political influence. ESG reporting has become performance theater designed to deflect rather than direct real change. The metrics that matter for survival cut through the noise: annual virgin plastic reduction percentages, microplastic leakage per product unit, and community impact assessments that resist superficial disclosure games. Companies serious about transformation are adopting cradle-to-cradle design principles, where materials flow in closed loops rather than linear waste streams. They're licensing breakthrough technologies rather than developing incrementally. They're building durable license-to-operate through genuine community partnerships. Most importantly, they're setting concrete targets: 20% virgin plastic reduction by 2027, zero microplastic leakage by 2030, and measurable community health improvements in production zones. The industry faces three plausible scenarios by 2030, each offering different positioning opportunities: Regulatory Acceleration: Rapid policy convergence around EPR and production limits favors companies with advanced circular capabilities and low-risk portfolio composition. Managed Transition: Gradual policy evolution allows time for technology deployment and market development, rewarding strategic partnerships between petrochemical leaders and innovation companies. Technology Breakthrough: CO‚ÇÇ-to-chemicals, advanced recycling, or bio-feedstock innovations achieve cost parity faster than expected, creating opportunities for early deployment partnerships. In each scenario, petrochemical majors who position themselves as energy-to-materials champions of the 21st century rather than defensive incumbents will capture the largest share of transition value. The companies that lead circular innovation rather than simply comply with it will define the next industrial era. The winning strategy combines managed portfolio evolution with aggressive technology deployment. Rather than abandoning core capabilities, leaders will redeploy them toward sustainable feedstocks, circular business models, and high-value applications that align with rather than fight against regulatory trends. Critically, circular feedstocks expand rather than shrink petrochemical demand pools‚Äîthey simply change the input sources while leveraging existing processing expertise. By 2030, expect three pivotal shifts that will reshape competitive dynamics: ‚Ä¢ Policy Convergence: The EU will implement a plastics border adjustment mechanism by the early 2030s, forcing global convergence on recycled content standards and inspiring similar measures in North America and Asia. ‚Ä¢ Petrostate Reinvention: At least one Gulf petrostate‚Äîlikely Saudi Arabia or the UAE‚Äîwill reposition as a global circular hub, investing heavily in CO‚ÇÇ-to-chemicals and advanced recycling to preserve export relevance in a carbon-constrained world. ‚Ä¢ Innovation Breakthroughs: TOMRA's 2025 deep learning AI systems, Carbios' operational enzyme facility, LanzaTech's UK scale-up, and Cemvita's microbial manufacturing platform will achieve commercial scale within five years, redrawing competitive advantage across the value chain. Additionally, Loop Industries' Twist resin launch and UBQ Materials' masterbatch deployment signal industrial breakthrough timing. The transformation won't be driven by treaties alone‚Äîcapital markets, regulators, and technology innovators are reshaping the rules of industrial survival faster than diplomatic processes ever could. Expect at least one $10 billion petrochemical expansion to be mothballed or canceled under investor pressure before 2030, validating Carbon Tracker's stranded asset thesis. This isn't about corporate virtue signaling‚Äîit's about optimizing portfolios for long-term value creation under changing market conditions. The petrochemical industry's inflection point has arrived. Companies can defend obsolete positions, adapt portfolios reactively, or lead the transition and capture first-mover advantages in next-generation materials. The UN's failure created a transition window, not a reprieve. Carbon Tracker research shows the industry is betting its future on demand growth that regulatory and market forces will constrain. The smartest leaders aren't waiting for policy clarity‚Äîthey're building capabilities that will thrive under any plausible regulatory scenario. The choice is strategic: adapt portfolios now to secure relevance through 2050 and beyond, or risk portfolio stranding as markets evolve. The companies that redeploy petrochemical expertise toward circular systems, sustainable feedstocks, and high-value applications won't just survive the transition‚Äîthey'll define it. The question is not whether this pivot happens, but which companies seize it first‚Äîand which are left behind. The next industrial cycle will be built on resource optimization, not resource depletion. The question is not whether the plastics pivot happens, but which manufacturing companies seize it first‚Äîand which are left behind.

Women‚Äôs Interprovincial Championships: Leinster 22 Munster 33 Munster put themselves in pole position for a shot at regaining the Vodafone Women‚Äôs Interprovincial Championship title following a business-like 33-22 win over Leinster at Energia Park. Playing with a maturity beyond her years, 19-year-old outhalf Caitr√≠ona Finn turned in her second player-of-the-match performance in the space of a week as Munster handed the defending champions a rare home defeat. Chisom Ugwueru‚Äôs try just before half-time, adding to a quick-fire Chloe Pearse brace either side of the 20-minute mark, had Munster leading 19-10 as they proved clinical with ball in hand. Leinster debutant Vicky Elmes Kinlan‚Äôs dazzling opener had certainly raised the decibel level. Yellow cards for forwards Lisa Callan and Jane Neill hampered them, albeit that Kathy Baker was able to cross in the 28th minute. However, Matt Brown‚Äôs charges effectively sealed the result when Kate Flannery and Aoife Corey both touched down inside 12 minutes of the restart. Molly Boyne and Katie Whelan replied late on for Leinster, giving them their own bonus point. With back-to-back bonus point victories, and next Saturday‚Äôs trip to Ulster still to come, Munster look red-hot favourites for the final in Donnybrook in two weeks‚Äô time. To set up a rematch with their arch rivals, Leinster will need to beat Connacht in Galway next week. Scorers: Leinster: Tries: Vicky Elmes Kinlan, Kathy Baker, Molly Boyne, Katie Whelan; Con: Ellie O‚ÄôSullivan Sexton Munster: Tries: Chloe Pearse 2, Chisom Ugwueru, Kate Flannery, Aoife Corey; Cons: Caitr√≠ona Finn 4 LEINSTER: Ellie O‚ÄôSullivan Sexton (Old Belvedere RFC); Emma Brogan (MU Barnhall RFC), Kathy Baker (Blackrock College RFC), Vicky Elmes Kinlan (Wicklow RFC), Maggie Boylan (Blackrock College RFC); Nikki Caughey (Railway Union RFC), Jade Gaffney (Old Belvedere RFC); Aoife Moore (Blackrock College RFC), Lisa Callan (Old Belvedere RFC), Katie Layde (Old Belvedere RFC), Cl√≠odhna N√≠ Chonchobhair (Blackrock College RFC), Kate Jordan (Blackrock College RFC), Ciara Short (Wicklow RFC), Molly Boyne (Railway Union RFC) (capt), Jane Neill (Old Belvedere RFC).

Referee: Siobh√°n Daly (IRFU) Connacht 12 Ulster 7 Second-half tries from replacement Faith Oviawe and Roisin Maher steered a young Connacht team to a gutsy 12-7 win over Ulster at Dexcom Stadium. With 21-year-old captain and player-of-the-match √âabha Nic Dhonnacha leading by example, Emer O‚ÄôDowd‚Äôs charges recovered from an early deficit to open their win account in this year‚Äôs Vodafone Women‚Äôs Interprovincial Championship. Ulster‚Äôs new centre Siobh√°n Sheerin thundered over in the ninth minute, raising her side‚Äôs hopes of a first victory at this level in two years. They still led 7-0 after half-time, emerging unscathed from Brenda Barr‚Äôs sinbinning. Nonetheless, with Connacht‚Äôs bench having the desired impact, forwards Oviawe and Maher scored within seven minutes of each other. In addition, Nic Dhonnacha clipped over the first conversion. The hosts, who wore their club socks on their State of Origin day, remained on the front foot and saw out a rousing triumph, putting last week‚Äôs disappointing display against Munster to bed. Unfortunately the hard-earned four points came at a cost for Connacht as the luckless Kayla Waldron was stretchered off in her first game since a horrific leg break in April 2024. There was a lot of concern too for Emily Foley who was taken off with an injury late on. Ulster picked up a losing bonus point for their efforts, and will have home advantage against table toppers Munster at Affidea Stadium next Saturday. Connacht remain in Galway, with a place in the final to play for against Leinster, who are two points better off. Scorers: Connacht: Tries: Faith Oviawe, Roisin Maher; Con: √âabha Nic Dhonnacha.

Title: Nothing to See Here: World Economic Forum Internal Investigation Clears Founder Klaus Schwab of Wrongdoing

An internal investigation conducted by the World Economic Forum has determined that there was no evidence that founder and former chairman Klaus Schwab committed wrongdoing during his time at the helm of the top globalist institution. Amid stepping down as chairman of the WEF in April, Great Reset architect Klaus Schwab faced accusations from whistleblowers of misconduct, including using World Economic Forum funds to pay for in-room massages in hotels, having staff withdraw WEF money from ATMs for his personal use, and using the organisation‚Äôs global competitivesness report to ‚Äúcurry favour‚Äù with certain governments. The 87-year-old German-born economist denied all allegations and reportedly launched a lawsuit against the whistleblowers. In response, the WEF hired the Swiss law firm Homburger as well as the American Covington & Burling firm to carry out an internal investigation into Schwab. Announcing the findings of the probe on Friday, the organisation said, according to the Financial Times: ‚ÄúMinor irregularities, stemming from blurred lines between personal contributions and forum operations, reflect deep commitment rather than intent of misconduct.‚Äù The WEF board went on to say that it sought to ‚Äúaddress all issues identified throughout the investigation, including strengthening the governance in general‚Äù. For his part, the former chairman said he was ‚Äúpleased that today‚Äôs decision lays the foundation for the WEF to continue contributing to the positive development of our society in the future, mindful of its more than 50-year history‚Äù. Meanwhile, the WEF named U.S. billionaire BlackRock ceo Larry Fink and Hoffmann-La Roche vice-chairman Andr√© Hoffmann as interim chairmen of the board as it seeks a permanent replacement for Schwab. The pair said that they plan on ‚Äúreinventing and strengthening the forum as an indispensable institution for public-private co-operation‚Äù. Originally founded as the European Management Forum in 1971 by then relatively unknown Geneva professor Schwab, with just $6,000 in startup funds, the World Economic Forum has gone on to become one of the most influential NGOs on the planet, with world leaders and heads of industry flocking every year to its annual conference in the Swiss ski town of Davos. Under Schwab‚Äôs leadership, the WEF became a leading promoter of an array of globalist projects, including carbon taxes, central bank digital currencies, global governance, tech censorship, transhumanism, and veganism, among others. Schwab also famously coined the concept of a ‚ÄúGreat Reset‚Äù of global capitalism in which so-called ‚Äúsocial justice‚Äù would shape decision-making about the world‚Äôs economy rather than simple market forces.

Title: XRP Takes On Live TV: Analyst Predicts Surge To $13 If This Happens

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Oliver Michael, the CEO of Tokentus, has again provided a bullish outlook for XRP. This time, he predicted that the altcoin could reach as high as $13 and outlined factors that could serve as catalysts for this significant price surge. Oliver Michael predicted in an interview that XRP could rally to $13 at some point if it sustained its current bullish momentum. He alluded to the Ripple SEC lawsuit, which just concluded and how it could spark several ripple effects, which would act as catalysts for the next leg up for the third-largest crypto by market cap. One of these ripple effects is the potential approval of the XRP ETFs. Michael noted that the SEC can now go on to approve these funds since the legal battle against Ripple is over. Furthermore, he raised the possibility of BlackRock filing for an XRP ETF and indicated that the altcoin is likely to record a parabolic rally if this happens, considering BlackRock‚Äôs position as the world‚Äôs largest asset manager. It is worth noting that BlackRock has said that it has no plans to file for an XRP ETF at the moment. However, XRP lawyer John Deaton believes that the world‚Äôs largest asset manager will still file to offer this fund within a year from now. If so, this could drive significant inflows into the XRP ecosystem, considering the success that the firm has recorded with its Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Meanwhile, Oliver Michael also expects more Ripple partners to emerge now that the SEC lawsuit is over. This will help enhance XRP‚Äôs utility as more companies adopt Ripple‚Äôs payment services. Notably, the crypto firm has also made great strides to expand its presence globally by acquiring platforms like the stablecoin platform Rail and brokerage firm Hidden Road. Another reason why the Tokentus CEO believes that XRP can reach this $13 price level is based on his expectation that retail investors will develop a greater interest in the altcoin now that Bitcoin and Ethereum have already pumped significantly. Therefore, they will turn to XRP as the third-largest crypto, which may have more upside than BTC and ETH. Michael remarked that XRP‚Äôs move to the upside could happen really fast, similar to its rally of over 300% from below $1 to $3 last year. The altcoin already rallied to as high as $3.6 this year, boasting a 33% year-to-date (YTD) gain. However, based on Michael‚Äôs prediction, the XRP price could still reach new highs in the coming months. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $3.10, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Cybersecurity researchers have detailed the inner workings of an Android banking trojan called ERMAC 3.0, uncovering serious shortcomings in the operators' infrastructure. "The newly uncovered version 3.0 reveals a significant evolution of the malware, expanding its form injection and data theft capabilities to target more than 700 banking, shopping, and cryptocurrency applications," Hunt.io said in a report. ERMAC was first documented by ThreatFabric in September 2021, detailing its ability to conduct overlay attacks against hundreds of banking and cryptocurrency apps across the world. Attributed to a threat actor named DukeEugene, it's assessed to be an evolution of Cerberus and BlackRock. Other commonly observed malware families ‚Äì including Hook (ERMAC 2.0), Pegasus, and Loot ‚Äì possess a shared lineage: An ancestor in the form of ERMAC from which source code components have been passed down and modified through generations. Hunt.io said it managed to obtain the complete source code associated with the malware-as-a-service (MaaS) offering from an open directory on 141.164.62[.]236:443, right down to its PHP and Laravel backend, React-based frontend, Golang exfiltration server, and Android builder panel. The functions of each of the components are listed below - Besides an expanded set of app targets, ERMAC 3.0 adds new form injection methods, an overhauled command-and-control (C2) panel, a new Android backdoor, and AES-CBC encrypted communications. "The leak revealed critical weaknesses, such as a hardcoded JWT secret and a static admin bearer token, default root credentials, and open account registration on the admin panel," the company said. "By correlating these flaws with live ERMAC infrastructure, we provide defenders with concrete ways to track, detect, and disrupt active operations."

Title: Follow the signs: vintage advertising brings high estimates at auction
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/life-style/fine-art-antiques/2025/08/16/follow-the-signs-vintage-advertising-bring-high-estimates-at-auction/

Advertising signage has a niche market among collectors, who are often willing to pay a few thousand euro for certain pieces of pub and shop memorabilia. Fans of such items should check out the catalogue for the upcoming online-only auction at Victor Mee Auctions based in Cloverhill, Co Cavan, on Tuesday and Wednesday, August 19th and 20th, from 6pm each evening. The auction of more than 1,000 lots is a tribute to a bygone era when advertising was a physical art form in which sign writers and designers honed their skills on metal and glass. One of the most expensive estimates in the auction, at ‚Ç¨3,000-‚Ç¨5,000, is for a mirror advertising Bendigo cigarettes in an art nouveau style. ‚ÄúThese mirrors were made as luxury advertising pieces, often displayed in tobacconists, grocers and public houses in the early 1900s,‚Äù says Mee. The maker of the mirror with hand-gilded lettering was A&H Pemberton, a Liverpool glass and sign manufacturer. A smaller mirror advertising the same brand went under the hammer at Fonsie Mealy‚Äôs auctions for ‚Ç¨1,600 in May last year. A more unusual sign advertising the chemical fertiliser, Hibernian Manure (‚Ç¨200-‚Ç¨400), might be of interest to an agricultural museum. Depicting a gentleman farmer engaging with a formally dressed saleswoman, it promises financial success to those who apply it to their land. Such was the importance attributed to promoting their products that in the 1930s, the manufacturers of the fertiliser offered a prize of ¬£3 to anyone who could illustrate scenes that could be used in their advertising. The Victor Mee auction also includes a set of 12 framed advertising prints explaining ‚ÄúThe Gentle Art of Making Guinness‚Äù (‚Ç¨500-‚Ç¨800). This whimsical series was originally produced by Guinness in the mid-20th century under the creative direction of John Gilroy, the artist behind Guinness‚Äôs most iconic campaigns. At an online auction set to take place on Saturday, August 30th, Lynes & Lynes auction rooms in Carrigtwohill, Co Cork, also have some old advertising signs from Musgrave Brothers depicting scenes of Cork, such as the Metropole Hotel on MacCurtain Street (‚Ç¨60-‚Ç¨100 each). ‚ÄúThe printed sign shows the Musgrave Brothers‚Äô head office on Cornmarket Street and at the base it shows the Metropole Hotel, with the Musgrave sweet factory behind. These are old signs and we expect good Cork interest,‚Äù says Denis Lynes. The auction also has some noteworthy historic pieces of furniture from Montenotte House in Cork city. Montenotte House is a Georgian end-terrace home with magnificent views over the river Lee from the city‚Äôs sought-after southern suburb of the same name. There is also a selection of 26 antique dolls (‚Ç¨100-‚Ç¨200 each) up for auction. Viewing of items runs from Saturday, August 23rd, to Friday, August 29th, from 10am-5pm daily. An interest in buying antiques and art often coincides with an interest in local history, so many buyers and sellers will no doubt be considering attending some events during National Heritage Week, which begins on August 16th. The free talks ‚Äì in person and online ‚Äì from the Crawford Art Gallery about the conservation of The Goose Girl by Edith Somerville (1858-1949) will be of interest to collectors of historic paintings. Somerville‚Äôs painting ‚Äì not to be confused with the National Gallery‚Äôs Goose Girl painting, originally believed to be by Irish artist William Leech but later confirmed to have been painted by English artist Stanley Royle ‚Äì depicts a young west Cork girl sitting on the floor holding a goose. Looking particularly sad, she is surrounded by vegetables and cooking utensils, which give the impression that the goose is destined for a tasty dinner. Somerville was born on the Greek island of Corfu but spent much of her life in Castletownshend in west Cork. Her painting echoed the French peasant realism style of the era. Although better known as one half of writing duo, Somerville and Ross, Somerville was also an accomplished artist, a suffragist and a progressive farmer who introduced the first herd of Friesian cattle to Ireland. The painting ‚Äì which is one of the Crawford art gallery‚Äôs most popular ‚Äì is now in need of crucial conservation work. Italian conservator Chiara Chill√®, registrar Jean O‚ÄôDonovan and curator Michael Waldron will explain the processes involved in talks being held on Tuesday, August 19thb at 1pm at the Civic Trust House in Cork City, and online on Wednesday, August 20th at 1pm. The Crawford Art Gallery closed to the public in September 2024 for major redevelopment but events such as these aim to keep the public connected to the collections therein. Meanwhile, Ann Chumbley, the collections registrar for the Butler Gallery in Kilkenny, will give a behind-the-scenes look at how to care and conserve art works at the gallery on Tuesday, 1pm-2.30pm. victormeeauctions.ie lynesandlynes.com heritageweek.ie Estimate ¬£3,000-¬£4,000 Hammer price ¬£3,900 (‚Ç¨4,508) Auction house Ross‚Äôs Auctioneers Estimate ‚Ç¨400-‚Ç¨500 Hammer price ‚Ç¨952 Auction house Adams Blackrock Estimate ‚Ç¨850-‚Ç¨950 Hammer price ‚Ç¨2,024 Auction house Adams Blackrock Estimate ‚Ç¨300-‚Ç¨400 Hammer price ‚Ç¨500 Auction house Adams Blackrock Sylvia Thompson, a contributor to The Irish Times, writes about health, heritage and the environment Keep up to date with fashion news and trends for you and your home.

Business Economy August 16, 2025 BlackRock's Larry Fink has been appointed interim co-chairman of the World Economic Forum, alongside Andre Hoffmann. The forum aims to drive international collaboration and distribute prosperity more broadly, says the newly appointed co-chairs. The WEF board cleared founder Klaus Schwab and Hilde Schwab of any misconduct following an investigation. Klaus Schwab founded the World Economic Forum, initially the European Management Forum, in 1971 as a corporate management symposium. ‚ÄúThe world is more fragmented and complex than ever,‚Äù said the new co-chairmen in a joint statement. BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink has been appointed interim co-chairman of the World Economic Forum (WEF), which organises the annual meeting of leaders in Davos, Switzerland. Andre Hoffmann, the vice chairman of Swiss based healthcare company Roche Holding, will also be interim co-chairman of the WEF, according to an announcement on Friday. ‚ÄúThe world is more fragmented and complex than ever, but the need for a platform that brings together business, government, and civil society has never been greater,‚Äù Mr Fink and Mr Hoffmann said in a joint statement. ‚ÄúWe remain optimistic. The forum has an opportunity to help drive international collaboration in a way that not only generates prosperity but distributes it more broadly.‚Äù "This renewed vision can promote open markets and national priorities side by side, while advancing the interests of workers and stakeholders globally," they said. Both Mr Fink and Mr Hoffmann have been serving on the WEF‚Äôs board before being appointed to the current position. The latest announcement comes as global economy feels the impact of geopolitical matters and the rise in protectionism fostered by the introduction of US tariffs. US President Donald Trump shook the world economy following his April 2 "liberation day" announcement, with new tariffs. A number of leaders from the world of business and politics attend the forum every year. Mr Trump addressed the forum online this year. The board of trustees of the WEF cleared founder Klaus Schwab of any ‚Äúmaterial wrongdoing‚Äù following an investigation into allegations raised by anonymous whistleblowers. ‚ÄúFollowing a thorough review of all facts, the board has concluded that, while the organisation must evolve toward a more institutional model, there is no evidence of material wrongdoing by Klaus Schwab,‚Äù the WEF said in the statement. It also cleared Hilde Schwab, wife of Mr Schwab, of any misconduct. ‚ÄúMinor irregularities, stemming from blurred lines between personal contributions and forum operations, reflect deep commitment rather than intent of misconduct,‚Äù the WEF said. ‚ÄúThe board has taken action to address all issues identified throughout the investigation, including strengthening the governance in general.‚Äù Mr Schwab started what became the World Economic Forum ‚Äì initially called the European Management Forum ‚Äì in 1971 as a symposium on corporate management. Since then, the event grew to become an annual gathering of about 2,500 corporate executives, financiers, and politicians, and other public figures from more than 100 countries, addressing matters such as inequality, migration, digital innovation and globalisation. With strong ties with leading organisations such as the UN and World Bank, the WEF has played a major role in navigating political issues and promoting a collaborative approach to global trade. Mr Schwab stepped down as head of board of trustees of the WEF in April this year.

Where on the plane does my pet travel? There are different types of travel available for pets: Each option is safe. The feasibility of each option is based on the size and breed of your pet, the airline they are traveling on and country they are travelling to. 2. What is the difference between my pet traveling as manifest cargo or as excess luggage? If traveling as manifest cargo, your pet is traveling in the front hold of the plane and can travel with or without you being on the same plane. The cost of your pets travel is based on volumetric weight, in other words, the size of their travel crate. If traveling as excess luggage, your pet will be in the rear hold of the plane and must be traveling under the ticket of a human passenger. The cost of your pets travel is based on the actual (combined) weight of your pet in their crate. 3. What happens when my pet arrives in the country they are traveling to? As soon as the flight arrives, your pet will be taken from the plane straight to the airport terminal. If your pet is traveling as excess luggage, they will taken to the oversized luggage area in the arrival hall. Once you clear passport control, you will be able to collect them at the same time as your normal luggage. As you exit the airport via the ‚Äòsomething to declare‚Äô customs channel you will be asked to present your pets travel paperwork to the customs official and / or the vet on duty. If your pet is traveling as manifest cargo, they will be taken to the Animal Reception Centre. There, their documentation will be reviewed by the staff of the ARC to ensure all is in order. At the same time, relevant customs formalities will be completed by staff based at the arriving airport. 4. How long does the travel paperwork and other travel preparations take? This depends entirely on the location that your pet is traveling to. Your pet relocation compnay will provide you with an accurate timeline of how long the relevant preparations will take and at what point in the process the various steps must be taken. In some cases they can get your pet ‚Äòtravel ready‚Äô in a few days. In others it can be up to six months or more. 5. What vaccinations does my pet need to travel? Regardless of where your pet is traveling, they will need certain vaccinations. The exact vaccinations they need are entirely dependent on the location they are traveling to. The one vaccination that is mandatory for every country your pet may travel to is a rabies vaccination. Other vaccinations may also be necessary. These will be advised to you as relevant. In every situation, it is essential to keep your vaccinations current and to not miss a due date, even by one day. To do so could severely hinder your pets travel plans.

The World Economic Forum has cleared Klaus Schwab of ‚Äúmaterial wrongdoing‚Äù after a law firm conducted a review into potential misconduct of the institution‚Äôs founder. The body also said Blackrock Inc.‚Äôs Larry Fink and Roche Holding AG vice chairman Andre Hoffmann will take over the leadership of the WEF board of trustees on an interim basis as co-chairs, according to a statement late Friday. Interim chairman Peter Brabeck-Letmathe is stepping down. ‚ÄúFollowing a thorough review of all facts, the Board has concluded that, while the organization must evolve toward a more institutional model, there is no evidence of material wrongdoing by Klaus Schwab,‚Äù it said in the statement. The board also said there is no evidence of any misconduct by Hilde Schwab, the wife of Klaus. The announcement ends a fight between the founder of the iconic institution and its board that was triggered by reports about potential misconduct by Klaus Schwab. Schwab abruptly resigned from the WEF in April after the misconduct allegations emerged, sparking the clash. The body launched an investigation to examine a range of accusations, including claims the 87-year-old used the forum‚Äôs resources for personal purposes. The dispute escalated when Schwab accused the WEF‚Äôs board of leaking details of an investigation against him to the media, complicating a peace agreement between the two parties. ‚ÄúMinor irregularities, stemming from blurred lines between personal contributions and Forum operations, reflect deep commitment rather than intent of misconduct,‚Äù the WEF said in its statement, pledging to improve its governance. Fink and Roche heir Hoffmann have been serving on the WEF‚Äôs board. The organization‚Äôs flagship event, the annual Davos meeting, has emerged into a must-attend event for bankers, business figures and politicians over the decades. The next gathering will take place in January 2026. ‚ÄúWe remain optimistic. The Forum has an opportunity to help drive international collaboration in a way that not only generates prosperity but distributes it more broadly,‚Äù Fink and Hoffmann said in a joint statement.

World World Economic Forum (WEF) founder Klaus Schwab speaks at the WEF's annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan 21, 2025. (File photo: AP/Markus Schreiber) The World Economic Forum (WEF) closed an investigation into its founder Klaus Schwab on Friday (Aug 15), clearing him of any wrongdoing, and appointed BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and Roche Holding's vice-chair Andre Hoffmann as interim co-chairs of its board. The Geneva-based organisation had launched an investigation in April into 87-year-old Schwab following a whistleblower letter alleging misconduct. The probe was announced a day after Schwab resigned as chairman. The forum at that time did not say why he was quitting. For decades, Schwab has been the face of the WEF's annual gathering of business and political leaders in the Swiss mountain resort of Davos, which has become a symbol of globalisation. The WEF said on Friday that its board had completed an investigation into allegations raised by anonymous whistleblowers against Schwab and found there was no evidence of material wrongdoing by him. WEF also did not find any misconduct by Schwab's wife and former assistant, Hilde Schwab. "Minor irregularities, stemming from blurred lines between personal contributions and forum operations, reflect deep commitment rather than intent of misconduct," WEF said. The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the probe in April, had said an anonymous letter raised concerns about the WEF's governance and workplace culture, including allegations that the Schwab family mixed their personal affairs with the forum's resources without proper oversight. In May, a spokesperson for Schwab informed Reuters that he had filed a criminal complaint against the whistleblowers. The Schwab family denied all the allegations in the whistleblower complaint to the Journal. Following the conclusion of the probe, a spokesman for Schwab told WSJ on Friday that he intends to drop his lawsuit against WEF and a separate legal action against anonymous whistleblowers. The WEF also said Peter Brabeck-Letmathe had stepped down as interim chairman following the investigation‚Äôs conclusion. In a statement posted on the WEF website, newly appointed co-chairs Fink and Hoffman said they were honoured to take on the leadership role on an interim basis and looked forward to reinventing and strengthening the organisation. WEF's Davos gathering has in recent years drawn criticism from opponents on both left and right as an elitist talking shop detached from the lives of ordinary people.

Arguably, the Russiagate releases can be looked upon as intentionally strategic, or just surreptitiously timed. The opposition to this discussion, meeting, peace effort and potential strategic realignment, includes: The CIA, NATO, the U.K, British intelligence (GCHQ), Five-Eyes, the European Union, China, BRICS, Ukraine, World Bank, Wall Street, the military industrial complex, Blackrock and global leftists. If President Trump and President Putin can overcome all those in opposition to their unity and still form a strategic alliance, the entire world changes. This cannot be overstated.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 15 | View Replies] To: FreeReign; GLDNGUN President Trump Outlines a Remarkably Altruistic IntentionAugust 16, 2025 | Sundance Fox News host Bret Baier was given exclusive access to President Trump during the much-anticipated summit in Alaska.Baier interviewed President Trump on Airforce One going to Anchorage and during the day‚Äôs events. In this interview, Baier asked President Trump what his expectations were going in. Trump noted it is not his place to negotiate the terms of a ceasefire on behalf of Ukraine; however, he is willing to be an intermediary in a focused effort to stop the conflict.Stopping the killing is President Trump‚Äôs main priority and peace is the elusive prize. In the background, as previously noted by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the administration accepts the conflict in Ukraine is essentially a proxy war between the former Biden administration officials, NATO warmongers, international banking interests and Russia.In a moment of genuine sunlight upon the backstory, President Trump notes he told President Putin, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no way we are going to make a deal‚Äù ‚Ä¶ ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù ‚Ä¶ ‚Äúbecause I have wise guys who created a phony deal,‚Äù the Trump-Russia collusion hoax, ‚Äúand until those things are settled up‚Äù a reset in the relationship with Russia is impossible. WATCH:EXPECTATIONS GAME: Trump describes ideal negotiations timeline, relationship with PutinThis framework essentially validates what a small group of deep weeds walkers, including myself, have suspected. From the perspective of Trump and his big picture objectives, the recent Russiagate releases and declassifications are not so much to get accountability upon the perpetrators, but rather to make the backstory so well known that a strategic reset with Russia is no longer impeded by manufactured domestic issues inside the USA.The value in Russiagate declassification and information releases, is more about laying the groundwork for a reset ‚Äì and stopping the political opposition therein. That‚Äôs the Big Picture value to President Trump.That is quite a big and significantly magnanimous position to take by President Trump.Hopefully, the MAGA base will eventually come around to this understanding, because right now they are intensely expecting criminal accountability. That‚Äôs not President Trump‚Äôs goal, he‚Äôs thinking much bigger and more consequential that holding the irrelevant gnats accountable.Apparently, Hillary Clinton can see that. It‚Äôs such a big altruistic position her tribe appears genuinely stunned. Hopefully, the base of MAGA will also accept this strategic purpose. 17 posted on 08/16/2025 4:01:32 AM PDT by Bratch [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 13 | View Replies] To: GLDNGUN In a moment of genuine sunlight upon the backstory, President Trump notes he told President Putin, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no way we are going to make a deal‚Äù ‚Ä¶ ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù ‚Ä¶ ‚Äúbecause I have wise guys who created a phony deal,‚Äù the Trump-Russia collusion hoax, ‚Äúand until those things are settled up‚Äù a reset in the relationship with Russia is impossible. This only confirms my point. Thank you. You'd have to be pretty obtuse to not understand what "settled up" means. You think "settled up" in Trump's mind means the crooks get off? That's exactly the opposite of what Trump has been saying. There's a "secret" to understanding what's going on in Trump's head. It's called read and listen to what he says and take it at face value. As for Hillary "If Trump wins, we'll all hang!" Clinton, her Nobel Peace Prize comment and her radio silence on the recent Russia hoax info dump on her head (while the other co-conspirators are chirping back) is indicative of someone tryin to position herself for a deal. Guess who are at the top of the list of people she HATES the most? Those would be the people she believes denied her the opportunity to be POTUS, something she wanted more desperately than a junkie wants a fix. Specifically, who are they? Obama, Brennan, and Comey. They also happen to be her top co-conspirators in the Russia hoax. What a coincidence! She's not going down with that ship. 18 posted on 08/16/2025 9:22:50 AM PDT by GLDNGUN [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 12 | View Replies] Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

In this interview, Baier asked President Trump what his expectations were going in. Trump noted it is not his place to negotiate the terms of a ceasefire on behalf of Ukraine; however, he is willing to be an intermediary in a focused effort to stop the conflict.Stopping the killing is President Trump‚Äôs main priority and peace is the elusive prize. In the background, as previously noted by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the administration accepts the conflict in Ukraine is essentially a proxy war between the former Biden administration officials, NATO warmongers, international banking interests and Russia.In a moment of genuine sunlight upon the backstory, President Trump notes he told President Putin, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no way we are going to make a deal‚Äù ‚Ä¶ ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù ‚Ä¶ ‚Äúbecause I have wise guys who created a phony deal,‚Äù the Trump-Russia collusion hoax, ‚Äúand until those things are settled up‚Äù a reset in the relationship with Russia is impossible. WATCH:EXPECTATIONS GAME: Trump describes ideal negotiations timeline, relationship with PutinThis framework essentially validates what a small group of deep weeds walkers, including myself, have suspected. From the perspective of Trump and his big picture objectives, the recent Russiagate releases and declassifications are not so much to get accountability upon the perpetrators, but rather to make the backstory so well known that a strategic reset with Russia is no longer impeded by manufactured domestic issues inside the USA.The value in Russiagate declassification and information releases, is more about laying the groundwork for a reset ‚Äì and stopping the political opposition therein. That‚Äôs the Big Picture value to President Trump.That is quite a big and significantly magnanimous position to take by President Trump.Hopefully, the MAGA base will eventually come around to this understanding, because right now they are intensely expecting criminal accountability. That‚Äôs not President Trump‚Äôs goal, he‚Äôs thinking much bigger and more consequential that holding the irrelevant gnats accountable.Apparently, Hillary Clinton can see that. It‚Äôs such a big altruistic position her tribe appears genuinely stunned. Hopefully, the base of MAGA will also accept this strategic purpose. 17 posted on 08/16/2025 4:01:32 AM PDT by Bratch [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 13 | View Replies] To: GLDNGUN In a moment of genuine sunlight upon the backstory, President Trump notes he told President Putin, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no way we are going to make a deal‚Äù ‚Ä¶ ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù ‚Ä¶ ‚Äúbecause I have wise guys who created a phony deal,‚Äù the Trump-Russia collusion hoax, ‚Äúand until those things are settled up‚Äù a reset in the relationship with Russia is impossible.

That's exactly the opposite of what Trump has been saying. There's a "secret" to understanding what's going on in Trump's head. It's called read and listen to what he says and take it at face value. As for Hillary "If Trump wins, we'll all hang!" Clinton, her Nobel Peace Prize comment and her radio silence on the recent Russia hoax info dump on her head (while the other co-conspirators are chirping back) is indicative of someone tryin to position herself for a deal. Guess who are at the top of the list of people she HATES the most? Those would be the people she believes denied her the opportunity to be POTUS, something she wanted more desperately than a junkie wants a fix. Specifically, who are they? Obama, Brennan, and Comey. They also happen to be her top co-conspirators in the Russia hoax. What a coincidence!

Trump noted it is not his place to negotiate the terms of a ceasefire on behalf of Ukraine; however, he is willing to be an intermediary in a focused effort to stop the conflict.Stopping the killing is President Trump‚Äôs main priority and peace is the elusive prize. In the background, as previously noted by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the administration accepts the conflict in Ukraine is essentially a proxy war between the former Biden administration officials, NATO warmongers, international banking interests and Russia.In a moment of genuine sunlight upon the backstory, President Trump notes he told President Putin, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no way we are going to make a deal‚Äù ‚Ä¶ ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù ‚Ä¶ ‚Äúbecause I have wise guys who created a phony deal,‚Äù the Trump-Russia collusion hoax, ‚Äúand until those things are settled up‚Äù a reset in the relationship with Russia is impossible. WATCH:EXPECTATIONS GAME: Trump describes ideal negotiations timeline, relationship with PutinThis framework essentially validates what a small group of deep weeds walkers, including myself, have suspected. From the perspective of Trump and his big picture objectives, the recent Russiagate releases and declassifications are not so much to get accountability upon the perpetrators, but rather to make the backstory so well known that a strategic reset with Russia is no longer impeded by manufactured domestic issues inside the USA.The value in Russiagate declassification and information releases, is more about laying the groundwork for a reset ‚Äì and stopping the political opposition therein. That‚Äôs the Big Picture value to President Trump.That is quite a big and significantly magnanimous position to take by President Trump.Hopefully, the MAGA base will eventually come around to this understanding, because right now they are intensely expecting criminal accountability. That‚Äôs not President Trump‚Äôs goal, he‚Äôs thinking much bigger and more consequential that holding the irrelevant gnats accountable.Apparently, Hillary Clinton can see that. It‚Äôs such a big altruistic position her tribe appears genuinely stunned. Hopefully, the base of MAGA will also accept this strategic purpose. 17 posted on 08/16/2025 4:01:32 AM PDT by Bratch [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 13 | View Replies] To: GLDNGUN In a moment of genuine sunlight upon the backstory, President Trump notes he told President Putin, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no way we are going to make a deal‚Äù ‚Ä¶ ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù ‚Ä¶ ‚Äúbecause I have wise guys who created a phony deal,‚Äù the Trump-Russia collusion hoax, ‚Äúand until those things are settled up‚Äù a reset in the relationship with Russia is impossible. This only confirms my point. Thank you. You'd have to be pretty obtuse to not understand what "settled up" means. You think "settled up" in Trump's mind means the crooks get off? That's exactly the opposite of what Trump has been saying. There's a "secret" to understanding what's going on in Trump's head. It's called read and listen to what he says and take it at face value. As for Hillary "If Trump wins, we'll all hang!" Clinton, her Nobel Peace Prize comment and her radio silence on the recent Russia hoax info dump on her head (while the other co-conspirators are chirping back) is indicative of someone tryin to position herself for a deal. Guess who are at the top of the list of people she HATES the most? Those would be the people she believes denied her the opportunity to be POTUS, something she wanted more desperately than a junkie wants a fix. Specifically, who are they? Obama, Brennan, and Comey. They also happen to be her top co-conspirators in the Russia hoax. What a coincidence! She's not going down with that ship. 18 posted on 08/16/2025 9:22:50 AM PDT by GLDNGUN [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 12 | View Replies] Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: xzins CT has lost the plot. He thinks that all of these Gabbard, Patel, and Bondi releases are leading to nothing. They just want to put all of the info out there to be aired in public. And that's it. 100% wrong. First, if they had no intention of bringing the conspirators to justice, it would be idiotic to make the case for indictments and arrests. Why set up huge expectations only for nothing, except bitter disappointment? Why is Trump tweeting like mad about it if he knows nothing is going to be done? It makes no sense. If they had no plans to pursue justice, they would ignore it and try to move on Secondly, God didn't bring Trump through the fire he endured for a brief, temporary reprieve. If Trump doesn't take down The Deep State, this nation (and the world) is toast. I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that God put Trump back in the White House to fulfill his divine destiny. He's leading a revolution that has only just begun. Obama and company are not going to escape God's justice. 6 posted on 08/15/2025 4:37:20 PM PDT by GLDNGUN [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: xzins Sundance is correct as usual.

This lays the groundwork for the public to be familiar with the WHY and HOW when the Grand Jury indictments are issued. If the Trump administration has no intention to do this, it makes no sense to hype it up and get everyone in a frenzy. Proving their guilt to the public and then leaving it hanging would be disastrous. It would embolden those that did wrong and those who would be tempted to do similar wrongs in the future. At the same time, it would be devastating for MAGA. If your DOJ hypes it up, but then doesn't bring charges that means you don't have a case. And if you don't have a case, you can't keep beating that horse. At some point, it's put up or shut up. If Trump had decided to just let the past go, they would be talking about other things and just move on. It's laughable to suggest that Trump is playing along with the "con" to hype up all the crimes, knowing in the end that nothing is going to happen. Trump is the most transparent politician, ever. He doesn't play games. What he says, is what he means. No, this is a complete whiff by CT. It's startling poor judgment of who Trump is and why he is POTUS at this time. 12 posted on 08/15/2025 6:49:11 PM PDT by GLDNGUN [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 9 | View Replies] To: Bratch Kash Patel says, ‚Äúwe are building a case for the American public‚Äú‚Ä¶ There it is.LOL.

Maybe someone can give Putin a reset button. >< I guess I misunderstood what you said. Fox News host Bret Baier was given exclusive access to President Trump during the much-anticipated summit in Alaska.Baier interviewed President Trump on Airforce One going to Anchorage and during the day‚Äôs events. In this interview, Baier asked President Trump what his expectations were going in. Trump noted it is not his place to negotiate the terms of a ceasefire on behalf of Ukraine; however, he is willing to be an intermediary in a focused effort to stop the conflict.Stopping the killing is President Trump‚Äôs main priority and peace is the elusive prize. In the background, as previously noted by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the administration accepts the conflict in Ukraine is essentially a proxy war between the former Biden administration officials, NATO warmongers, international banking interests and Russia.In a moment of genuine sunlight upon the backstory, President Trump notes he told President Putin, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no way we are going to make a deal‚Äù ‚Ä¶ ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù ‚Ä¶ ‚Äúbecause I have wise guys who created a phony deal,‚Äù the Trump-Russia collusion hoax, ‚Äúand until those things are settled up‚Äù a reset in the relationship with Russia is impossible. WATCH:EXPECTATIONS GAME: Trump describes ideal negotiations timeline, relationship with PutinThis framework essentially validates what a small group of deep weeds walkers, including myself, have suspected. From the perspective of Trump and his big picture objectives, the recent Russiagate releases and declassifications are not so much to get accountability upon the perpetrators, but rather to make the backstory so well known that a strategic reset with Russia is no longer impeded by manufactured domestic issues inside the USA.The value in Russiagate declassification and information releases, is more about laying the groundwork for a reset ‚Äì and stopping the political opposition therein. That‚Äôs the Big Picture value to President Trump.That is quite a big and significantly magnanimous position to take by President Trump.Hopefully, the MAGA base will eventually come around to this understanding, because right now they are intensely expecting criminal accountability.

Posted on 08/15/2025 3:48:01 PM PDT by xzins The Russiagate Releases Were Organized in Advance of this Summit August 15, 2025 | Sundance While it may be frustrating to many people to realize most of the Russiagate declassification and releases of information are not intended to generate indictments or legal accountability, on the strategic upside the view of the public toward the U.S. Intelligence Community propaganda provides major breathing room for a U.S-Russia reset. Arguably, the Russiagate releases can be looked upon as intentionally strategic, or just surreptitiously timed. The opposition to this discussion, meeting, peace effort and potential strategic realignment, includes: The CIA, NATO, the U.K, British intelligence (GCHQ), Five-Eyes, the European Union, China, BRICS, Ukraine, World Bank, Wall Street, the military industrial complex, Blackrock and global leftists. If President Trump and President Putin can overcome all those in opposition to their unity and still form a strategic alliance, the entire world changes. This cannot be overstated.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: xzins CT has lost the plot. He thinks that all of these Gabbard, Patel, and Bondi releases are leading to nothing. They just want to put all of the info out there to be aired in public. And that's it. 100% wrong. First, if they had no intention of bringing the conspirators to justice, it would be idiotic to make the case for indictments and arrests. Why set up huge expectations only for nothing, except bitter disappointment? Why is Trump tweeting like mad about it if he knows nothing is going to be done? It makes no sense. If they had no plans to pursue justice, they would ignore it and try to move on Secondly, God didn't bring Trump through the fire he endured for a brief, temporary reprieve. If Trump doesn't take down The Deep State, this nation (and the world) is toast. I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that God put Trump back in the White House to fulfill his divine destiny. He's leading a revolution that has only just begun. Obama and company are not going to escape God's justice. 6 posted on 08/15/2025 4:37:20 PM PDT by GLDNGUN [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: xzins Sundance is correct as usual.

This lays the groundwork for the public to be familiar with the WHY and HOW when the Grand Jury indictments are issued. If the Trump administration has no intention to do this, it makes no sense to hype it up and get everyone in a frenzy. Proving their guilt to the public and then leaving it hanging would be disastrous. It would embolden those that did wrong and those who would be tempted to do similar wrongs in the future. At the same time, it would be devastating for MAGA. If your DOJ hypes it up, but then doesn't bring charges that means you don't have a case. And if you don't have a case, you can't keep beating that horse. At some point, it's put up or shut up. If Trump had decided to just let the past go, they would be talking about other things and just move on. It's laughable to suggest that Trump is playing along with the "con" to hype up all the crimes, knowing in the end that nothing is going to happen. Trump is the most transparent politician, ever. He doesn't play games. What he says, is what he means. No, this is a complete whiff by CT. It's startling poor judgment of who Trump is and why he is POTUS at this time. 12 posted on 08/15/2025 6:49:11 PM PDT by GLDNGUN [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 9 | View Replies] To: Bratch Kash Patel says, ‚Äúwe are building a case for the American public‚Äú‚Ä¶ There it is.LOL.

So Kash goes TV and you complain that there is noting going on.

This only confirms my point. Thank you. You'd have to be pretty obtuse to not understand what "settled up" means. You think "settled up" in Trump's mind means the crooks get off? That's exactly the opposite of what Trump has been saying. There's a "secret" to understanding what's going on in Trump's head. It's called read and listen to what he says and take it at face value. As for Hillary "If Trump wins, we'll all hang!" Clinton, her Nobel Peace Prize comment and her radio silence on the recent Russia hoax info dump on her head (while the other co-conspirators are chirping back) is indicative of someone tryin to position herself for a deal. Guess who are at the top of the list of people she HATES the most? Those would be the people she believes denied her the opportunity to be POTUS, something she wanted more desperately than a junkie wants a fix. Specifically, who are they? Obama, Brennan, and Comey. They also happen to be her top co-conspirators in the Russia hoax. What a coincidence! She's not going down with that ship. 18 posted on 08/16/2025 9:22:50 AM PDT by GLDNGUN [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 12 | View Replies] Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

In this interview, Baier asked President Trump what his expectations were going in. Trump noted it is not his place to negotiate the terms of a ceasefire on behalf of Ukraine; however, he is willing to be an intermediary in a focused effort to stop the conflict.Stopping the killing is President Trump‚Äôs main priority and peace is the elusive prize. In the background, as previously noted by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the administration accepts the conflict in Ukraine is essentially a proxy war between the former Biden administration officials, NATO warmongers, international banking interests and Russia.In a moment of genuine sunlight upon the backstory, President Trump notes he told President Putin, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no way we are going to make a deal‚Äù ‚Ä¶ ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù ‚Ä¶ ‚Äúbecause I have wise guys who created a phony deal,‚Äù the Trump-Russia collusion hoax, ‚Äúand until those things are settled up‚Äù a reset in the relationship with Russia is impossible. WATCH:EXPECTATIONS GAME: Trump describes ideal negotiations timeline, relationship with PutinThis framework essentially validates what a small group of deep weeds walkers, including myself, have suspected. From the perspective of Trump and his big picture objectives, the recent Russiagate releases and declassifications are not so much to get accountability upon the perpetrators, but rather to make the backstory so well known that a strategic reset with Russia is no longer impeded by manufactured domestic issues inside the USA.The value in Russiagate declassification and information releases, is more about laying the groundwork for a reset ‚Äì and stopping the political opposition therein. That‚Äôs the Big Picture value to President Trump.That is quite a big and significantly magnanimous position to take by President Trump.Hopefully, the MAGA base will eventually come around to this understanding, because right now they are intensely expecting criminal accountability. That‚Äôs not President Trump‚Äôs goal, he‚Äôs thinking much bigger and more consequential that holding the irrelevant gnats accountable.Apparently, Hillary Clinton can see that. It‚Äôs such a big altruistic position her tribe appears genuinely stunned.

That's exactly the opposite of what Trump has been saying. There's a "secret" to understanding what's going on in Trump's head. It's called read and listen to what he says and take it at face value. As for Hillary "If Trump wins, we'll all hang!" Clinton, her Nobel Peace Prize comment and her radio silence on the recent Russia hoax info dump on her head (while the other co-conspirators are chirping back) is indicative of someone tryin to position herself for a deal. Guess who are at the top of the list of people she HATES the most? Those would be the people she believes denied her the opportunity to be POTUS, something she wanted more desperately than a junkie wants a fix. Specifically, who are they? Obama, Brennan, and Comey.

They just want to put all of the info out there to be aired in public. And that's it. 100% wrong. First, if they had no intention of bringing the conspirators to justice, it would be idiotic to make the case for indictments and arrests. Why set up huge expectations only for nothing, except bitter disappointment? Why is Trump tweeting like mad about it if he knows nothing is going to be done? It makes no sense. If they had no plans to pursue justice, they would ignore it and try to move on Secondly, God didn't bring Trump through the fire he endured for a brief, temporary reprieve. If Trump doesn't take down The Deep State, this nation (and the world) is toast. I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that God put Trump back in the White House to fulfill his divine destiny. He's leading a revolution that has only just begun. Obama and company are not going to escape God's justice. 6 posted on 08/15/2025 4:37:20 PM PDT by GLDNGUN [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: xzins Sundance is correct as usual.

If the Trump administration has no intention to do this, it makes no sense to hype it up and get everyone in a frenzy.

At the same time, it would be devastating for MAGA. If your DOJ hypes it up, but then doesn't bring charges that means you don't have a case. And if you don't have a case, you can't keep beating that horse. At some point, it's put up or shut up. If Trump had decided to just let the past go, they would be talking about other things and just move on. It's laughable to suggest that Trump is playing along with the "con" to hype up all the crimes, knowing in the end that nothing is going to happen. Trump is the most transparent politician, ever.

In this interview, Baier asked President Trump what his expectations were going in. Trump noted it is not his place to negotiate the terms of a ceasefire on behalf of Ukraine; however, he is willing to be an intermediary in a focused effort to stop the conflict.Stopping the killing is President Trump‚Äôs main priority and peace is the elusive prize. In the background, as previously noted by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the administration accepts the conflict in Ukraine is essentially a proxy war between the former Biden administration officials, NATO warmongers, international banking interests and Russia.In a moment of genuine sunlight upon the backstory, President Trump notes he told President Putin, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no way we are going to make a deal‚Äù ‚Ä¶ ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù ‚Ä¶ ‚Äúbecause I have wise guys who created a phony deal,‚Äù the Trump-Russia collusion hoax, ‚Äúand until those things are settled up‚Äù a reset in the relationship with Russia is impossible. WATCH:EXPECTATIONS GAME: Trump describes ideal negotiations timeline, relationship with PutinThis framework essentially validates what a small group of deep weeds walkers, including myself, have suspected. From the perspective of Trump and his big picture objectives, the recent Russiagate releases and declassifications are not so much to get accountability upon the perpetrators, but rather to make the backstory so well known that a strategic reset with Russia is no longer impeded by manufactured domestic issues inside the USA.The value in Russiagate declassification and information releases, is more about laying the groundwork for a reset ‚Äì and stopping the political opposition therein. That‚Äôs the Big Picture value to President Trump.That is quite a big and significantly magnanimous position to take by President Trump.Hopefully, the MAGA base will eventually come around to this understanding, because right now they are intensely expecting criminal accountability. That‚Äôs not President Trump‚Äôs goal, he‚Äôs thinking much bigger and more consequential that holding the irrelevant gnats accountable.Apparently, Hillary Clinton can see that. It‚Äôs such a big altruistic position her tribe appears genuinely stunned. Hopefully, the base of MAGA will also accept this strategic purpose. 17 posted on 08/16/2025 4:01:32 AM PDT by Bratch [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 13 | View Replies] To: GLDNGUN In a moment of genuine sunlight upon the backstory, President Trump notes he told President Putin, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no way we are going to make a deal‚Äù ‚Ä¶ ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù ‚Ä¶ ‚Äúbecause I have wise guys who created a phony deal,‚Äù the Trump-Russia collusion hoax, ‚Äúand until those things are settled up‚Äù a reset in the relationship with Russia is impossible. This only confirms my point. Thank you. You'd have to be pretty obtuse to not understand what "settled up" means. You think "settled up" in Trump's mind means the crooks get off? That's exactly the opposite of what Trump has been saying. There's a "secret" to understanding what's going on in Trump's head. It's called read and listen to what he says and take it at face value. As for Hillary "If Trump wins, we'll all hang!" Clinton, her Nobel Peace Prize comment and her radio silence on the recent Russia hoax info dump on her head (while the other co-conspirators are chirping back) is indicative of someone tryin to position herself for a deal. Guess who are at the top of the list of people she HATES the most? Those would be the people she believes denied her the opportunity to be POTUS, something she wanted more desperately than a junkie wants a fix. Specifically, who are they? Obama, Brennan, and Comey. They also happen to be her top co-conspirators in the Russia hoax. What a coincidence! She's not going down with that ship. 18 posted on 08/16/2025 9:22:50 AM PDT by GLDNGUN [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 12 | View Replies] Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

Maybe someone can give Putin a reset button. >< I guess I misunderstood what you said. Fox News host Bret Baier was given exclusive access to President Trump during the much-anticipated summit in Alaska.Baier interviewed President Trump on Airforce One going to Anchorage and during the day‚Äôs events. In this interview, Baier asked President Trump what his expectations were going in. Trump noted it is not his place to negotiate the terms of a ceasefire on behalf of Ukraine; however, he is willing to be an intermediary in a focused effort to stop the conflict.Stopping the killing is President Trump‚Äôs main priority and peace is the elusive prize. In the background, as previously noted by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the administration accepts the conflict in Ukraine is essentially a proxy war between the former Biden administration officials, NATO warmongers, international banking interests and Russia.In a moment of genuine sunlight upon the backstory, President Trump notes he told President Putin, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no way we are going to make a deal‚Äù ‚Ä¶ ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù ‚Ä¶ ‚Äúbecause I have wise guys who created a phony deal,‚Äù the Trump-Russia collusion hoax, ‚Äúand until those things are settled up‚Äù a reset in the relationship with Russia is impossible. WATCH:EXPECTATIONS GAME: Trump describes ideal negotiations timeline, relationship with PutinThis framework essentially validates what a small group of deep weeds walkers, including myself, have suspected. From the perspective of Trump and his big picture objectives, the recent Russiagate releases and declassifications are not so much to get accountability upon the perpetrators, but rather to make the backstory so well known that a strategic reset with Russia is no longer impeded by manufactured domestic issues inside the USA.The value in Russiagate declassification and information releases, is more about laying the groundwork for a reset ‚Äì and stopping the political opposition therein. That‚Äôs the Big Picture value to President Trump.That is quite a big and significantly magnanimous position to take by President Trump.Hopefully, the MAGA base will eventually come around to this understanding, because right now they are intensely expecting criminal accountability.

(Bloomberg) -- The World Economic Forum has cleared Klaus Schwab of ‚Äúmaterial wrongdoing‚Äù after a law firm conducted a review into potential misconduct of the institution‚Äôs founder. The body also said Blackrock Inc.‚Äôs Larry Fink and Roche Holding AG vice chairman Andre Hoffmann will take over the leadership of the WEF board of trustees on an interim basis as co-chairs, according to a statement late Friday. Interim chairman Peter Brabeck-Letmathe is stepping down. ‚ÄúFollowing a thorough review of all facts, the Board has concluded that, while the organization must evolve toward a more institutional model, there is no evidence of material wrongdoing by Klaus Schwab,‚Äù it said in the statement. The board also said there is no evidence of any misconduct by Hilde Schwab, the wife of Klaus. The announcement ends a fight between the founder of the iconic institution and its board that was triggered by reports about potential misconduct by Klaus Schwab. Schwab abruptly resigned from the WEF in April after the misconduct allegations emerged, sparking the clash. The body launched an investigation to examine a range of accusations, including claims the 87-year-old used the forum‚Äôs resources for personal purposes. The dispute escalated when Schwab accused the WEF‚Äôs board of leaking details of an investigation against him to the media, complicating a peace agreement between the two parties. ‚ÄúMinor irregularities, stemming from blurred lines between personal contributions and Forum operations, reflect deep commitment rather than intent of misconduct,‚Äù the WEF said in its statement, pledging to improve its governance. Fink and Roche heir Hoffmann have been serving on the WEF‚Äôs board. The organization‚Äôs flagship event, the annual Davos meeting, has emerged into a must-attend event for bankers, business figures and politicians over the decades. The next gathering will take place in January 2026. ‚ÄúWe remain optimistic. The Forum has an opportunity to help drive international collaboration in a way that not only generates prosperity but distributes it more broadly,‚Äù Fink and Hoffmann said in a joint statement. (Updates with comments from Fink and Hoffmann in last paragraph, details on the dispute between Klaus Schwab and the WEF throughout) More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com ¬©2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: Bank of America shares an eye-popping chart showing a potential stock-market bubble: 'It better be different this time'

Stock-market bulls convinced of the power of AI to transform the economy often shrug off comparisons to the dot-com bubble a quarter century ago. The real profits are already showing up, unlike in the early days of the internet boom ‚Äî so it is different this time, the thinking goes. But Bank of America strategist Michael Hartnett has a message for these investors: "It better be different this time." Hartnett, who has often expressed skepticism of the market's bull run over the last few years, shared a head-turning chart that highlights just how optimistic investors have become about the impact AI will have. It shows the S&P 500's price-to-book ratio, which measures the total market cap of the index's constituents compared to their total assets minus liabilities. The valuation measure is at a record high of 5.3, topping the 5.1 level seen in March 2000, at the peak of the dot-com bubble. Other classic valuation measures show market froth relative to history. For instance, Hartnett also shared a chart showing the S&P 500's 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio. Except for August 2020, it's at the highest level since the dot-com era. And the Shiller cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings ratio, which measures current prices against a 10-year rolling average of earnings, is at similar levels to 1929, 2000, and 2021. High valuations reflect high expectations for future earnings. Sometimes those expectations turn out to be too elevated, and prices correct, but they don't necessitate a bubble scenario. So far, many AI firms have continually beat earnings expectations, suggesting the optimism could be justified. Valuations are also better predictors of average long-term returns than near-term performance, and views on Wall Street on where the market goes in the months ahead differ. Though there are calls for caution, many strategists continue to raise their year-end S&P 500 price targets. Earlier this week, Rick Rieder, the chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock, said the market is in the "best investing environment ever" thanks to factors like strong demand for stocks, looming rate cuts, and recent boosts in productivity and earnings growth. If the market does start to unwind, however, Hartnett said he sees bonds and non-US stocks benefiting. Examples of funds that offer exposure to these trades include the iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF (AGG) and the Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US ETF (VEU). Jump to

The ports are part of a broad expansion plan being organized by the waterway‚Äôs administration. It aims to increase services related to cargo handling, including trans shipment, storage and gas transportation, and to secure fresh water for operations. ‚ÄúThere is a large demand for facilities and terminals,‚Äù said Ricaurte Vasquez, head of the waterway, at a conference on Thursday, without elaborating on details. The Panama Canal Authority did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Its top executives have previously said the waterway plans to invest some $8.5 billion in the next five years to update and expand its infrastructure. A key project included in the planning, the construction of a large dam to contain the Indio river and create a new water reservoir, will be discussed at Panama‚Äôs Supreme Court after affected communities filed a lawsuit against it last month. Another tender to offer a project to build a liquefied petroleum gas pipeline within the canal zone also is in preparation and could be launched next year, the source added. U.S. President Donald Trump this year threatened to take over the Panama Canal amid criticism of what his government has called the increasing influence of China over the Central American country. Meanwhile, Panama‚Äôs President Jose Mulino has moved to end a 25-year concession to Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison 0001.HK for the operation of two key separate ports outside of the canal zone amid criticism of the contract‚Äôs terms. CK Hutchison said on Thursday that a $22.8 billion deal with a group led by BlackRock BLK.N and shipping firm MSC to sell most of its global port business, including the two ports in Panama, had a ‚Äúreasonable chance‚Äù of going through.

Title: Bullish crypto exchange surges 90% on debut, raising $1.1 billion

FREE MEETING: KEY TRENDS AND RISKS IN TECH GAMES‚Äì REGISTER Bullish, a cryptocurrency exchange operator, saw its stock price surge on its opening day, ending at $70 with a 90% gain. This gave the company a market cap above $10 billion. The stock opened for trade near 1:00 p.m. ET on Wednesday at $90 and peaked at $118 per share shortly after, a 215% gain. However, the stock was halted for trade at least twice within the first few minutes due to volatility. Bullish, which operates a crypto exchange and owns the trade publication CoinDesk, launched its IPO on Tuesday. The company aimed higher than its anticipated price range of $32 to $33 per share. In 2021, Bullish sought a valuation of $9 billion but faced regulatory hurdles, causing them to withdraw their registration at the time. The debut of Bullish follows recent successful high-profile public offerings, including Figma and Circle. This indicates that the IPO market is robust after several challenging years. Data from IPO tracker and ETF operator Renaissance Capital shows that the market has introduced entities worth more than $50 million this year, up by more than 58% compared to last year. Major institutional investors showed substantial interest in Bullish ahead of its IPO. Firms such as BlackRock and Cathie Wood‚Äôs Ark Invest signaled their interest in the offering, according to securities filings. Bullish CEO Thomas Farley, formerly COO and president of the NYSE Group, said, ‚ÄúWe now intend to IPO because we believe that the digital assets industry is beginning its next leg of growth. I believe that the digital assets industry is at the inflection point of institutional adoption and Bullish is uniquely positioned at the center of this market.‚Äù Bullish‚Äôs primary business operations come from its Bullish Exchange, a digital assets spot and derivative exchange targeting institutional-sized clients. The company‚Äôs prospectus shows that the exchange experienced robust activity throughout the first quarter of this year. The positive performance of digital assets this year also underscores Bullish‚Äôs strong IPO. Major cryptocurrencies have experienced substantial gains, with Bitcoin up more than 30%, Ethereum up more than 40%, and Ripple‚Äôs XRP up over 57% since the beginning of the year. The successful public offering of Bullish suggests that Wall Street‚Äôs predictions for a sluggish IPO market in 2025 may have been overly pessimistic.

Title: BlackRock‚Äôs Crypto Holdings Balloon As Bitcoin, Ethereum Reach For New ATHs ‚Äî Here Are The Numbers

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. BlackRock‚Äôs cryptocurrency portfolio has surpassed the $100 billion mark, as Bitcoin and Ethereum push to new all-time highs. The world‚Äôs largest asset manager now holds nearly $104 billion in digital assets, and this achievement came as Bitcoin briefly broke above $124,000 on August 14, 2025, to set a new price record before consolidating between $118,000 and $121,000. Ethereum also surged to nearly $4,790, just shy of its 2021 peak of $4,878. Bitcoin and Ethereum have been on a price roll in recent weeks, and a large part of this momentum can be attributed to steady institutional inflows into Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs based in the US. At the forefront of this surge is BlackRock, the world‚Äôs largest asset manager, which continues to dominate in terms of assets under management (AUM) and growth in cryptocurrency exposure, particularly in Ethereum in the past two months. Interestingly, data from Arkham Intelligence shows that BlackRock has crossed the $100 billion mark in terms of total crypto holdings. This interesting milestone is based on a combination of inflows into its ETFs, which has increased its accumulation strategy, and the recent uptick in the price of cryptocurrencies across the board. Data from Arkham Intelligence shows BlackRock‚Äôs total holdings recently hit a peak value of $107 billion when Bitcoin reached a record price of $124,128 yesterday, and Ethereum reached a multi-year price peak of $4,775. At the time of writing, the investment management company is holding 744,240 BTC worth $88.43 billion and 3.2 million ETH, worth approximately $14.78 billion. At the beginning of 2025, BlackRock‚Äôs cryptocurrency portfolio was valued at roughly $54 billion, with the overwhelming majority of that exposure concentrated in Bitcoin. However, the first quarter of the year brought a period of weakness, as Arkham Intelligence data shows the portfolio‚Äôs value slid to a low of about $46 billion in early April. From that point on, momentum shifted sharply in the opposite direction. The firm‚Äôs total holdings have since climbed by about 124% from April 7 up until the time of writing. Bitcoin still accounts for more than 85% of BlackRock‚Äôs crypto allocation, but the most remarkable growth story in the past eight months has come from Ethereum. In both volume and market value, ETH holdings have expanded at a far more aggressive pace than Bitcoin, surging by over 309% in dollar terms since the start of the year. At the start of 2025, BlackRock‚Äôs Bitcoin reserves stood at approximately 552,000 BTC. Current data indicates that Bitcoin holdings have grown by about 34% over the course of the year. Ethereum‚Äôs expansion within BlackRock‚Äôs portfolio has been even more notable, as the firm began the year with roughly 1.1 million ETH and has more than doubled its position in just eight months, with the current volume representing a 190% increase.

August 15, 2025 08:00 ET | Source: SharpLink Gaming, Inc. SharpLink Gaming, Inc. MINNEAPOLIS, MN, Aug. 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SharpLink Gaming, Inc. (Nasdaq: SBET) (‚ÄúSharpLink‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù), one of the world‚Äôs largest corporate holders of Ether (‚ÄúETH‚Äù) and prominent industry advocate of Ethereum adoption, today reported financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, along with an update on the rapid expansion of the Company‚Äôs ETH treasury strategy. In early June 2025, SharpLink executed a significant strategic shift ‚Äì establishing ETH as the Company‚Äôs primary treasury reserve asset. SharpLink‚Äôs goal is simple: give investors the most efficient way to participate in Ethereum‚Äôs transformation of global finance, with institutional-grade discipline, transparency and full activation of ETH‚Äôs yield potential. SharpLink is strategically accumulating ETH through disciplined capital formation and employing active treasury management. The result is a powerful, yield-generating ETH treasury that compounds growth and captures the full upside exposure of ETH while improving our ETH Concentration metric. Every step of this strategy strengthens the Ethereum network and creates enduring long-term value, aligning stockholder growth with the growth of the ecosystem itself. SharpLink‚Äôs treasury strategy is based on a single conviction: ETH will serve as the core trust commodity of the next-generation financial system being built on Ethereum. Key Highlights Since Launch of ETH Treasury Strategy Chalom stated, ‚ÄúOur second quarter marked the exciting launch of SharpLink‚Äôs ETH treasury strategy, which has positioned us at the center of a transformational opportunity in global finance and technology. In the short period since launching our strategy, we‚Äôve raised significant capital and scaled our ETH holdings in a highly accretive manner. Backed by the unmatched expertise of Consensys and our institutional-grade capital markets and treasury management teams, SharpLink has become one of the world‚Äôs largest and most trusted corporate holders of ETH.‚Äù ‚ÄúEthereum is the trust layer for the decentralized economy, and SharpLink‚Äôs aggressive accumulation, staking and strategic management of ETH set it apart from any other public company in the market,‚Äù added Lubin. ‚ÄúSharpLink is actively compounding value for our fellow stockholders through yield generation and intelligent capital deployment.‚Äù Financial Highlights for the Three Months Ended June 30, 2025 Financial Highlights for the Six Months Ended June 30, 2025 For more detailed information on SharpLink‚Äôs second quarter financial and operational results, please refer to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday, August 14, 2025, which can be found at www.sec.gov or www.sharplink.com. Q2 2025 Conference Call and Webcast As a reminder, SharpLink‚Äôs leadership will host a conference call and webcast beginning at 8:30 AM ET today to discuss the Company‚Äôs financial and operating results for the three- and six-month reporting periods ended June 30, 2025. The Company will also provide an update on recent developments, including the launch of its Ethereum treasury strategy on June 2, 2025 and subsequent strategic actions aimed at accelerating long-term stockholder value. To access the call or webcast, please use one of the following means: * To enhance transparency into the Company‚Äôs yield performance, SharpLink introduced a new reporting metric called ‚ÄúETH Concentration.‚Äù This metric is calculated by dividing the number of ETH SharpLink holds by each 1,000 assumed diluted shares issued and outstanding (‚ÄúAssumed Diluted Shares Outstanding‚Äù). Assumed Diluted Shares Outstanding represents the sum of (i) SharpLink‚Äôs actual shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of the end of each reporting period, inclusive of disclosed ATM sales and Registered Direct offerings, plus (ii) the additional shares that would be issued upon the assumed exercise or settlement of all outstanding warrants, pre-funded warrants, stock option awards, and restricted stock units. Notably, Assumed Diluted Shares Outstanding is not calculated using the treasury stock method. It does not account for equity award vesting conditions, stock option exercise prices, or contractual restrictions limiting the convertibility of debt instruments. Additionally, it excludes any assumed share repurchases that would ordinarily be considered under the treasury stock method. About SharpLink Gaming, Inc. Headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota, SharpLink Gaming, Inc. (Nasdaq: SBET) is one of the world‚Äôs largest publicly traded companies to adopt Ether (‚ÄúETH‚Äù) as its primary treasury reserve asset ‚Äì a move that aligns the Company with the future of digital capital and gives investors direct exposure to Ethereum, the world‚Äôs leading smart-contract platform and second largest digital asset.

Title: How big data and an A-list board turned struggling NYU Langone into a $14 billion hospital powerhouse
URL: https://fortune.com/article/nyu-langone-hospital-robert-grossman-ken-langone-health-data/
Time Published: 2025-08-15T09:30:00Z
Full Content:
On a rainy afternoon in May, the 96 members of New York University Grossman School of Medicine, Class of 2025, gathered with their families in Carnegie Hall. They crossed the stage, collected their degrees, and all together recited the Hippocratic oath. But while their graduation into the ranks of medical doctors was the point of the ceremony, in some ways it did not feel like the day‚Äôs main event.That belonged to another pair on stage, Dr. Robert Grossman and Ken Langone‚Äîgraduates of a different sort, who as dean and board chairman respectively were presiding for the 18th and last time over the graduation ceremony. This was their swan song, or maybe something more of a victory lap. Grossman spoke of his hard-fought path to the top of NYU Langone‚Äî‚ÄúI had no sponsors, no mentors, no coaches. No one was there to introduce me to any ‚Äòimportant‚Äô people or direct my career‚Äù‚Äîbefore imparting 15 nuggets of wisdom he had collected. (No. 1: ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter where you come from, it does matter how high you aim.‚Äù No. 5: ‚ÄúDepth of knowledge is very important.‚Äù No. 14: ‚ÄúFind the right partner.‚Äù) His business partner, Langone, gave him a warm embrace and in his own speech, remarked that his association with Grossman was ‚Äúone of the most rewarding of his life.‚Äù The audience was well-disposed to share the spotlight: Thanks to Langone and Grossman, their medical educations had all come tuition-free. And Grossman‚Äôs lessons were on point‚Äîsince they encapsulated the ambition and tenacity that made NYU Langone an enviable success story in American health care. Two decades ago, NYU‚Äôs academic medical center was a troubled institution, treading water; today, it‚Äôs one of the country‚Äôs most efficient providers of high-quality care, with 53,000 employees, roughly $14 billion in revenue‚Äîup from $2 billion in 2007‚Äîand more than 320 locations. Its innovations in medical-school education‚Äîintroducing an accelerated three-year curriculum, and that free tuition‚Äîhave made its programs models for others around the country. NYU Langone has wooed world-leading talent while scaling the ranks of federally funded research hospitals. And while it has taken place in a health care setting, the NYU Langone recovery has been driven by two interlinked factors‚Äîa disciplined reliance on data and a relentless culture of accountability‚Äîthat wouldn‚Äôt feel out of place on Wall Street or in Silicon Valley. The turnaround is a source of much pride for the somewhat unlikely pair that presided over it: Grossman, a neuroradiologist who had no formal business training when he became CEO and dean of the medical center in 2007; and Ken Langone, the billionaire co-founder of Home Depot who has chaired its board‚Äîand given so much time and money to the institution that it now bears his name‚Äîsince 1999. (Langone, who is also a major Republican donor, later honored Grossman by naming NYU Langone‚Äôs two medical schools after him.) It‚Äôs a story the two men, 78 and 89 respectively, are eager to tell as they prepare to hand over their roles to carefully selected successors come September 1. NYU Langone granted Fortune access to its executives and inner workings to better understand the organization and its transformation. For a reporter who has written extensively about the nation‚Äôs often dysfunctional health system, it was an opportunity to learn what it took for one American health system to succeed‚Äîand what others can learn from it. It‚Äôs also a time when many hospitals need help‚Äîstat. In 2023, 48% of the nation‚Äôs rural hospitals operated at a financial loss. More than one-third of them‚Äîsome 700‚Äîwere at risk of closure, according to a 2024 report by the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform. And this year‚Äôs cuts to Medicaid and National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding have imposed serious turbulence on hospitals of all kinds. NYU Langone has been blessed by geography‚Äîheadquartered amid the concentrated wealth of midtown Manhattan‚Äîand supported, in time and generous donations, by a board that reads like the guest list of a Davos cocktail party. Beyond Langone, and to name just a few, trustees include board co-Chair and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, Ken Chenault (former CEO of American Express), and former Goldman Sachs exec and Trump advisor Gary Cohn. Overseers include JPMorgan Chase‚Äôs Jamie Dimon, billionaire hedge funder Paul Tudor Jones, and David Zaslav, president and CEO of Warner Brothers. NYU Langone is a non-profit health system, but make no mistake, it‚Äôs run like the big business that it is. (By 2024 revenues, it would rank No. 308 on this year‚Äôs Fortune 500.) Grossman earned $22.8 million in total compensation in 2023, and its doctors rank among New York‚Äôs highest paid‚Äîas Tom Murphy, founder and partner at private-equity fund Crestview Partners and another trustee, proudly pointed out to me, ‚ÄúWe pay our people well to do a good job.‚Äù Many are uncomfortable with the notion of non-profit hospitals operating more like Fortune 500 companies than charity wards. But Ge Bai, a professor of accounting and health policy at Johns Hopkins, says, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the reality nowadays.‚Äù She notes that NYU Langone has been uniquely successful in the industry because of its strengths generating patient revenue and controlling expenses. ‚ÄúTheir operations are amazing,‚Äù Bai adds. $14 billionApproximate revenue for the NYU Langone health system in 2024. You may wonder if NYU Langone is successful simply because it is charging more. But an analysis of Turquoise Health data, showing rates charged by New York‚Äôs five large hospital systems for eight frequently performed procedures found that NYU‚Äôs prices, on average, ranked second-lowest, behind Mount Sinai. Indeed, the operations are where the learnings are. And while it‚Äôs tempting to ask how transferrable lessons from a wealthy, well-connected hospital system can be in other parts of the country, NYU Langone in recent years has expanded into more difficult markets‚Äîthat is, ones with poorer and sicker patients‚Äîgenerating evidence that its turnaround playbook can work outside of the rarified confines of Manhattan. What then is NYU‚Äôs secret sauce, and how can others replicate the formula? Things were not good when Grossman arrived at New York University Medical Center to run the radiology department in 2001. He was days into the role when a pipe burst in his office, leaving a pile of plaster and unsightly debris. It took eight weeks to get someone from the organization to fix it, because no one would take ownership: Was the medical school responsible for the wall, or the hospital? To Grossman, who had come from Penn, the absurd situation symbolized the inefficiency and dysfunction that ailed NYUMC and academic medicine more broadly. When he became dean and CEO in 2007, Grossman vowed to run the school and hospital as a single integrated entity. He also boldly committed to make the institution ‚Äúworld-class‚Äù‚Äî‚Äúan academic medical center competing successfully with the Hopkins, the Harvards and Penns,‚Äù he wrote in his investiture speech. Langone, a self-made business titan who, before co-founding Home Depot, had taken Electronic Data Systems public with Ross Perot, shared Grossman‚Äôs lofty goals. He had joined the board in 1999 when his friend, Martin Lipton, an M&A attorney and NYU trustee, told Langone he needed help with a mess at the medical center. (A graduate of NYU‚Äôs business school, Langone says he didn‚Äôt even realize NYU had a medical center.) That mess: a 1998 merger with Mount Sinai that had gone so badly that the hospitals broke up a few years later. By 2003, the combined entity had racked up three straight years of losses, $670 million in debt, and a junk-bond rating. The institution was independent again, but not profitable, when Grossman got promoted in 2007. Langone and Grossman had bonded several years earlier when Grossman, wanting to replace his department‚Äôs radiology equipment, had put out a request for proposals. Showing some raw business talent, he negotiated an unthinkably good deal with Siemens: The medtech company agreed to give NYU the technology, plus $100 million for NYU to serve as a showroom. Those terms impressed Langone, who happened to be on the board of General Electric, a losing bidder. That Langone didn‚Äôt let that conflict‚Äîor his friendship with GE‚Äôs then-CEO Jack Welch‚Äîinterfere with the Siemens deal, meanwhile, impressed Grossman. Over the years, the two have become incredibly close, trading regular phone calls and referring to each other as ‚Äúbrothers from different mothers.‚Äù Grossman attributes their kinship to their hardscrabble childhoods and the resilience it fostered. He was a scholarship kid who described his mom to me as ‚Äúan illegal immigrant.‚Äù Langone‚Äôs parents, also immigrants, worked as a plumber and a cafeteria worker, and didn‚Äôt get schooling beyond junior high. Langone, 11 years Grossman‚Äôs senior, plays the gregarious and protective older sibling in the relationship. When I met him at his Park Avenue office, he heaped praise on Grossman‚Äî‚ÄúHe‚Äôs brilliant‚Ä¶values beyond reproach‚Ä¶this guy could take my job doing deals!‚Äù (When it comes to himself, Langone‚Äôs prone to absurd self-effacement: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not the brightest bulb,‚Äù he tends to say, emphasizing his science education ended in 8th grade.) The big-brother vibe plays out practically too: Grossman, who described Langone as ‚Äúthe best guy in the world,‚Äù says he‚Äôs a keenly intelligent sounding board, and some extra muscle. ‚ÄúWe deal with politicians, and he‚Äôs connected, and that‚Äôs very important as well.‚Äù The board sees the duo‚Äôs dynamic as a key to NYU Langone‚Äôs success. Murphy describes Grossman as the transformation‚Äôs visionary, and Langone as its enabling force. Fink, who points out his firm owns 5%-10% of virtually every major company in the world, says, ‚ÄúI see some really good leadership and some really crappy leadership, but it was very clear, very early on that the chemistry between Bob and Ken was something very unique.‚Äù He adds, ‚ÄúBob grew into the CEO role‚Äîa lot of it was the trust he had with Ken, and maybe a little bit with me.‚Äù Grossman‚Äôs leadership was a shock to the broader system, however. He fired most of the executive team before his first day. Not long after, he ripped out a relatively new $35 million electronic health-record system, telling the board he needed to install the more expensive Epic system instead. Rather than acquiring hospitals‚Äîthe go-to strategy for health systems at the time‚ÄîGrossman committed to building a network of outpatient facilities, correctly anticipating that technology would allow an increasing share of procedures to be performed outside of hospitals. (That strategy has paid off: Ambulatory facilities don‚Äôt require 24/7 staffing and are more profitable.) Relaying the events to me 18 years later, Grossman still seemed tickled by his own audacity, and the fact that he has shown up naysayers, like a McKinsey consultant who told him he was doing too many things too fast. Satisfying too, was his experience watching a class at Harvard Business School discuss NYU Langone, the case study. The students struck Grossman as timid: They‚Äôd all viewed his early management purge‚Äî‚ÄúBlack Wednesday,‚Äù as it became known‚Äîas cataclysmic. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think it was any big deal,‚Äù he told me. ‚ÄúI just didn‚Äôt think the institution was functioning.‚Äù Dr. Andrew Brotman, NYU Langone‚Äôs outgoing chief clinical officer, recalls that Grossman fired people he was friendly with that day, with no apparent anguish. That sort of compartmentalization is ‚Äúcharacteristic of Bob,‚Äù he told me. ‚ÄúHe does what‚Äôs best for the organization.‚Äù Fiona Druckenmiller, a former portfolio manager who joined NYU Langone‚Äôs board in 2006‚Äîand who will succeed Langone as chair on Sept. 1‚Äî describes Bob ‚Äúas one of the most decisive people I‚Äôve ever met.‚Äù The key to decision-making at NYU Langone is the ‚Äúdashboard,‚Äù a data-rich tool that tracks more than 800 metrics across the system in real time. Grossman created the platform, which he refers to as the organization‚Äôs ‚Äúsole source of truth,‚Äù with the help of a small, select team early in his tenure; he felt the input of other managers would muddy his vision. The dashboard captures everything from teacher evaluations and high-impact publications to ICU bed space and operating-room turnover time. It‚Äôs how Grossman obsessively manages the place, and how the contribution of every department, physician, nursing unit, and administrator is measured. Big data is hardly novel in the corporate world, but the analytics that has already revolutionized most industries has been slower to transform health care, due to clumsy IT systems, fragmented providers, and heightened privacy concerns. Perhaps what sets NYU Langone‚Äôs dashboard apart is its thoroughness and its centrality to the organization. I was eager to see the dashboard data through Grossman‚Äôs eyes, and he agreed to give me a demonstration one morning. He clicked through his go-to pages‚Äîone flagging trending data across the system, another showing emergency department stats. (Average ‚Äúdoor to doc time‚Äù that morning: 13 minutes; average time in ER: 4.5 hours, which Grossman described as ‚Äúdamn good.‚Äù) We looked up his own dashboard usage (269 log-ins in the past year; enough to put him in the top 2.5% of the system‚Äôs users, but well short of his Chief of Hospital Operations, Dr. Fritz Fran√ßois, whose count topped 4,000.) The granularity of data has been key to identifying issues and fixing them. Even before the dashboard came online, for example, Grossman noticed a quirk with the NYU Langone‚Äôs ‚Äúcase mix index,‚Äù a measure that reflects the complexity of patient cases and care provided. Grossman realized that physicians weren‚Äôt fully documenting cases, and as a result, weren‚Äôt being fully reimbursed for care. A major documentation effort followed, an exercise which helped turn around the organization‚Äôs finances. If Grossman has a north star metric, it‚Äôs ‚Äúlength of stay.‚Äù Hospital operations are more profitable, in essence, when in-patient stays are short, and so length-of-stay has become an NYU Langone benchmark of focus. To some, that may sound sinister, like an incentive for kicking patients out before they‚Äôre ready to go home. But there‚Äôs considerable evidence that unnecessary time in the hospital can do patients more harm than good, increasing their risk of infection or other complications, which are also costly for the system. NYU Langone now has one of the nation‚Äôs lowest average lengths of stay‚Äîsomething Grossman could show me thanks to third-party data that populates the dashboard and allows comparing NYU Langone to 115 other large health systems. He navigated over to a screen ranking hospitals by observed-to-expected mortality. The dashboard showed NYU Langone with the lowest mortality index, which Grossman pointed out before somewhat gleefully namechecking his lagging rivals. ‚ÄúNew York-Presbyterian, probably twice the mortality,‚Äù he noted, scanning the list. ‚ÄúUniversity of Pennsylvania‚Ä¶Duke‚Ä¶ Here‚Äôs North Shore‚Äîfour times the mortality!‚Äù he exclaimed, breaking into a hearty chuckle. (It should be noted that because NYU Langone‚Äôs rate was very low‚Äî32 patients dying when 100 would have been expected to die in similar circumstances‚Äîthose competitors had death rates that were roughly in line with or better than industry standards.) ‚ÄúBob is very competitive,‚Äù Druckenmiller later told me, ‚ÄúHe does keep track of how everyone else is doing.‚Äù The dashboard is key to keeping operations on track, but Grossman says it‚Äôs more important impact has been on culture. To make his point, he showed me the page of a faculty member: Dr. Robert Montgomery, an award-winning transplant surgeon with a prodigious handlebar moustache. He pointed out the range of available stats (on-time OR starts, patient infection rates, grant funding) and double-clicked on a few to show how Montgomery ranked among colleagues. I asked if this feature led some doctors to obsessively check their own performance. ‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs the behavior,‚Äù Grossman said matter-of-factly. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how you become number one.‚Äù Are there any limitations to the metrics or cases where they aren‚Äôt fair? Plenty of faculty members have challenged assessments that they‚Äôre underproductive, Grossman says, but when that happens, he can simply point them to the dashboard: Why do they have zero grants or zero high-impact publications when others in the same department have several? The measures are objective, he says, and the system fully transparent. Even as I marveled at the data available, I wondered if the dashboard-driven culture‚Äîpart Moneyball, part panopticon‚Äî might feel oppressive to some. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not for everyone,‚Äù Brotman later told me. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre on the hook 24/7, 365, and you‚Äôve got this vulnerability and this expectation of accountability. If you don‚Äôt have the right disposition, it‚Äôs hard to deal with.‚Äù I felt awkward simply being in the room for moments of the ‚ÄúSnapshot Review,‚Äù a meeting where the chairs of clinical departments filed onstage for dashboard-informed questioning from administrators. The review sessions, in an airy conference room overlooking the East River, varied considerably in tone and substance. Some involved praise and practical problem-solving; others, discussions of ‚Äúlow-performing faculty members‚Äù; and another‚Äîfeaturing a relatively new leader who clearly hadn‚Äôt found his footing‚Äîthe feel of a man pleading for mercy. Over time, NYU Langone leaders have gotten better at identifying the people who buy into the culture and thrive, and those who don‚Äôt. (The health system claims an approximate 10% annual employee turnover rate.) Who does thrive? People who like data, who accept that medicine is a science and not an art (NYU standardizes processes, right down to the surgical tools used). A theme that came up in my interviews‚Äîsomewhat surprisingly, at a high-performing health system‚Äîwas how little people sleep. ‚ÄúBob doesn‚Äôt turn off,‚Äù Druckenmiller said of Grossman. She explained that a lot of the hospital‚Äôs most important business gets done over phone calls at 4:30 in the morning, because that‚Äôs an hour when Langone, Grossman, and she (and others) are all awake and not commuting yet. She said that Grossman‚Äôs successor, Dr. Alec Kimmelman, is that way too. (When Druckenmiller asked Kimmelman‚Äôs wife if she was ready for him to take on the role, she answered she didn‚Äôt expect anything would change‚Äîhe was gone before she woke up and home after she went to bed.) When I asked Langone how he managed it all, he told me, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt sleep. The other guy‚Äôs sleeping while I‚Äôm doing other stuff.‚Äù The culture of self-care has not yet come for NYU Langone leadership, but work-life balance is on its radar. At a Snapshot review meeting I attended, there was discussion of the outgoing infectious disease chief, and how his ‚ÄúIron Man Model‚Äù was not as in-fashion with the younger generation of doctors. Kimmelman, who comes across as thoughtful and laid-back, assured me NYU Langone‚Äôs culture welcomes non-workaholics. What matters, he says, is that ‚Äúeven if their attitudes towards work-life balance are different than mine, they‚Äôre still devoted to excellence and quality and taking great care of patients.‚Äù At the time of my visit, I had just finished watching The Pitt, the HBO medical drama focused on one chaotic, 15-hour shift in a Pittsburgh emergency room. Throughout the series, a suit-wearing, metrics-obsessed administrator drops by to scold the staff on the measures in which they‚Äôre falling short‚Äî wait times, patient satisfaction scores, documentation‚Äîratcheting up the pressure on overstretched doctors and nurses trying to save lives. One naturally sympathizes with the staff, but it can be easy to overlook that the administrator‚Äôs goals‚Äîhowever warped by the economics of the health system‚Äîare actually in the interest of patient care, or at least of keeping the hospital‚Äôs doors open. (Grossman hadn‚Äôt watched the show. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs my cup of tea,‚Äù he told me.) It can be easy to vilify micromanagement, but Dr. Oren Cahlon, a radiation oncologist who will take Brotman‚Äôs job in September‚Äîsays it has been effective at NYU Langone. Recently Cahlon had been digging into patient access issues‚Äîthe long wait times new patients face to make appointments at NYU. He‚Äôd been plumbing physicians‚Äô schedules, drawing up new policies‚ÄîHow often did patients really need follow-up appointments? Could some of those existing patients see a nurse practitioner or physician assistant instead? ‚Äîand even changing compensation models to incentivize providers to see new patients. Brotman approvingly compared Cahlon‚Äôs work to ‚Äúguerilla warfare,‚Äù noting that he‚Äôd managed to increase new-patient appointments by 10% to 40%. It hadn‚Äôt immediately gone over well, but Brotman and Cahlon had engaged staff and patients about the reasons for the changes. Contrary to the concerns that adding more patients would cause burnout and tank satisfaction scores, Brotman says they‚Äôve seen the opposite. A 30-minute ferry ride from NYU‚Äôs gleaming Manhattan campus delivers you to the health system‚Äôs Brooklyn hospital, on the industrial fringes of Sunset Park. The facility, wrapped in scaffolding due to ongoing renovation, is shabbier than the midtown mothership. It serves a diverse population, many of whom are not native English speakers, and 82% of whom depend on government insurance.But the care and increasingly the range of services match those back at headquarters. Since NYU Langone completed its merger with Lutheran, a struggling community hospital, in 2016, its patient safety and health outcome measures have vastly improved. (Observed-to-expected mortality has fallen 60% since 2017; complications have come down 58%.) And it‚Äôs profitable this year, because it‚Äôs seeing more patients, and seeing them more efficiently. Getting there involved many years of taking the same fine-tooth-comb data-driven approach to hospital operations. When NYU took over, most of the doctors there were contractors, and the under-resourced facility was working with outdated infrastructure and technology: Cardiologists, for example, would view electrocardiograms on VHS tapes. There‚Äôs often suspicion and fear when a large health system acquires a smaller community hospital, and it‚Äôs well-founded; big systems often strip their acquisitions of services and send patients to their larger facilities for sophisticated care. NYU Langone met with similar skepticism, but the result has been the opposite: it invested in the Brooklyn hospital, hired a full-time staff, and added a range of higher-end services‚Äîcardiac catheterization labs, neurosurgery, cancer care‚Äîbringing care into the community. The day I visited, I found Dr. Bret Rudy, chief of hospital operations, in his office, studying dashboard data on a large monitor. It was 9:45 a.m., and so far, 41 patients had arrived in the emergency department; seven were waiting for beds, including one whose digital profile he clicked on for my benefit, who was being admitted for a possible case of tuberculosis. Rudy navigated to operating stats‚Äîwhere 92% of the day‚Äôs first procedures that month had started on time. ‚ÄúThat should be higher,‚Äù he said, explaining that turnaround time between procedures should be 30 minutes or less. The dashboard had allowed him and a pair of surgeons he‚Äôd deputized to optimize workflow, investigating late starts and rooting out inefficiencies. Since 2017, they‚Äôve increased the number of surgeries by more than 20% (a total of 2,000 more surgeries per year), through disciplined scheduling and 6 a.m. start-times. Nine years in, NYU Langone Hospital-Brooklyn is practically a well-oiled machine. The front lines of NYU‚Äôs transformation effort have shifted to Patchogue, a town on 12,000 on Long Island, where it recently completed a merger with a community hospital, now known as NYU Langone Hospital-Suffolk. Suffolk County is famed for the glitzy Hamptons, but closer to Patchogue it‚Äôs home to working-class towns troubled by the opioid epidemic and MS-13 gang activity. The Suffolk County hospital was in rough shape when NYU Langone entered the picture a few years ago; after years of underinvestment, its reputation had suffered, and patients that ended up there tended to be either very sick or accident victims brought in from the Long Island Expressway. Other health systems had considered purchasing the hospital but always walked away; Dr. Marc Adler, chief of hospital operations, recalls that when he first introduced himself, a staff member said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be gone in three months.‚Äù Adler is now several years into the job, implementing the NYU Langone playbook. The patient population is largely covered by Medicare and Medicaid, and it suffers from greater levels of substance abuse and mental health issues than NYU Langone-Brooklyn‚Äôs does. Among NYU‚Äôs first investments were a larger security staff and a new behavioral health facility; surgical robots and new operating rooms have been added too. They‚Äôve hired a new full-time staff, some poached from NYU‚Äôs hospital in neighboring Nassau County. There had been plenty of room for efficiency improvements at the hospital. ‚ÄúIf everyone‚Äôs coming in at 9 a.m., you‚Äôre never going to start your cases at 7 a.m.,‚Äù says Adler. Only 30% of the day‚Äôs first surgeries started on time in 2021. The doctors, who were on contract and would stop by only a few days per week, erred on the side of longer stays‚Äîkeeping patients in the hospital over the weekend or for another day if they hadn‚Äôt seen them. Adler of course, showed me his dashboard. The quality of care and patient outcomes are much improved over the past few years, and over 90% of the day‚Äôs first cases now start on time. NYU Langone Hospital-Suffolk has a ‚ÄúC‚Äù safety grade by the standards of Leapfrog Group, a hospital ranking group‚Äîall other NYU hospitals have an ‚ÄúA‚Äù‚Äîbut Adler explains it‚Äôs due to Leapfrog‚Äôs methodology, which relies on data from up to three years prior. NYU Langone executives say the level of care is now equivalent to the system‚Äôs other hospitals. Like other nonprofit health systems, NYU Langone is facing cuts to Medicaid and NIH funding. Last year, the NYU Grossman School of Medicine ranked 11th in terms of NIH awards, with $490 million in funding according to the Blue Ridge Institute for Medical Research, which tracks the field. According to BRIMR‚Äôs analysis, NYU‚Äôs medical school has so far had a handful of grants worth $12 million terminated; 56 schools had greater losses in funding. ‚ÄúObviously we think a lot about that,‚Äù Kimmelman, Grossman‚Äôs successor, tells me. Like a lot of institutions, NYU Langone is looking at ways to diversify research funding from other sources, and some affected researchers have had to pivot. At the same time, Kimmelman says his team is trying to not let the uncertainty distract them from their mission or the various expansion projects already in motion. He takes inspiration from Grossman, who in the depths of COVID, a financially perilous period, didn‚Äôt hesitate to invest in important but extremely expensive technology. The decision came down to impact on patient care. ‚ÄúI think our fundamentals are incredibly solid,‚Äù Kimmelman says. ‚ÄúIf we can‚Äôt thrive or survive in whatever happens to NIH, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs going to be any health care system that can.‚Äù It‚Äôs not the first time a dire situation has largely been out of NYU Langone‚Äôs control. Many vividly remember the night in 2012 when Hurricane Sandy plunged lower Manhattan and NYU Langone (its generators failed) into darkness, flooding the Manhattan campus and shuttering the hospital and medical school for several weeks. ‚ÄúI thought it was all over,‚Äù says Brotman. Langone happened to be a patient that night, recovering from pneumonia. He was evacuated from the 17th floor at 3 a.m., along with 23 infants staying in the neo-natal intensive care unit. Langone vividly remembers following the procession‚Äîthe babies still attached to tubes, each one cradled by a nurse lying on a sled, while others carefully carried the sled and medical equipment down the pitch-dark stairway‚Äîand the sound of nurses, in perfect unison, saying ‚ÄúStep, step, step,‚Äù until they made it to the ground floor. It‚Äôs still one of his proudest moments. And as instrumental as he has been to NYU Langone‚Äôs recovery and its broader accomplishments, the day I visited him Langone kept steering me back to the system‚Äôs smaller, anecdotal triumphs‚Äîlike the too-scared-to-sleep heart transplant patient who was comforted in the middle of the night by a kind building services worker. While Grossman‚Äôs laser focus on industry-leading care is filtered through an obsessive, data-driven wonkiness, Langone relishes the human stories, the living, breathing proof their work has made a difference. On his desk, behind boxes of Dots Christmas candy, framed photos, and a sign that reads ‚ÄúThe Buck Stops Here,‚Äù were cards that he‚Äôd occasionally pick up mid-conversation and read to me‚Äîfrom grateful patients, or family members, or former employees, thanking him for their experience at NYU Langone. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got a bunch of them,‚Äù he told me, as if the testimonies answered all remaining questions. He always writes a note back. ¬© 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Saudi Press Agency Thursday 20/02/1447 Dhahran, August 14, 2025, SPA -- Aramco, one of the world's leading integrated energy and chemicals companies, signed an $11 billion lease and leaseback deal involving its Jafurah natural-gas processing facilities with a consortium of international investors, led by funds managed by Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), a part of BlackRock. Jafurah is the largest non-associated gas development in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, estimated to contain 229 trillion standard cubic feet of raw gas and 75 billion stock tank barrels of condensate. It is a key component in Aramco's plans to increase gas production capacity by 60% between 2021 and 2030, to meet rising demand. As part of the transaction, Jafurah Midstream Gas Company (JMGC) will lease development and usage rights for the Jafurah Field Gas Plant and the Riyas NGL Fractionation Facility, and lease them back to Aramco for a period of 20 years. JMGC will receive a tariff payable by Aramco in exchange for granting Aramco the exclusive right to receive, process, and treat raw gas from Jafurah. Aramco will hold a 51% majority stake in JMGC, with the remaining 49% held by investors led by GIP. The transaction, which will not impose any restrictions on Aramco's production volumes, is expected to close as soon as practicable, subject to customary closing conditions. According to Aramco president and chief executive Amin Nasser, "Jafurah is a cornerstone of our ambitious gas expansion program, and the GIP-led consortium's participation as investors in a key component of our unconventional gas operations demonstrates the attractive value proposition of the project. This foreign direct investment into the Kingdom also highlights the appeal of Aramco's long-term strategy to the international investment community." "As Jafurah prepares to start phase one production this year, development of subsequent phases is well on track," Nasser said. "We look forward to Jafurah playing a major role as a feedstock provider to the petrochemicals sector, and supplying energy required to power new growth sectors, such as AI data centers, in the Kingdom." GIP chairman and chief executive Adebayo Ogunlesi said, "We are pleased to deepen our partnership with Aramco with our investment in Saudi Arabia's natural-gas infrastructure, a key pillar of global natural-gas markets. Today's announcement builds upon BlackRock and GIP's longstanding relationship with Aramco to serve growing market needs for cleaner fuels, energy security, and energy affordability." The opportunity to invest in one of the region's most significant natural-gas developments garnered significant interest from investors worldwide. Co-investors in the transaction include leading institutional investors from Asia and the Middle East. When completed, the transaction will support the optimization of Aramco's assets and capture additional value from the development of the Jafurah gas field. GIP's mid-market infrastructure equity team, which invests in diversified and contracted mid-market infrastructure assets and businesses around the world, has a robust, long-term track record of successful investments in the Middle East. The investment also builds upon the strong existing relationship between Aramco and BlackRock. In 2022, BlackRock co-led a consortium of investors in a separate minority investment in Aramco Gas Pipelines Company. -- SPA 23:43 Local Time 20:43 GMT 0057

Title: Why Chainlink (LINK) Could Be The Biggest Winner In Stablecoins And Tokenization Era

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. The stablecoin and tokenization sectors are experiencing a significant resurgence, fueled by pro-crypto regulations introduced by the Trump administration. As a result, experts believe that decentralized oracle network, Chainlink (LINK), is poised to reap substantial benefits from these progressive developments. Market expert Miles Deutscher recently highlighted that LINK may be the most promising large-cap investment opportunity this cycle, despite the possibility that many investors could overlook it. In a social media post on X (formerly Twitter), the expert asserted that Chainlink is uniquely positioned to benefit from the ‚Äúinstitutionalization of cryptocurrency‚Äù and the explosive growth of stablecoins, tokenization, and real-world assets (RWAs). Notably, the total value locked (TVL) in RWAs has surged thirteenfold in just two years, climbing from approximately $1 billion to over $13 billion as institutions increasingly recognize the limitations of the traditional SWIFT payment system. In response, major financial players like asset manager and crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuer, BlackRock, are advocating for tokenization, while companies such as Stripe and Circle (CRCL) are now exploring the development of their own blockchain solutions. In this environment, Chainlink serves as a crucial ‚Äúuniversal translator.‚Äù According to Deutscher, each tokenized stock, bond, or piece of real estate requires an oracle to accurately reflect its value on-chain, and Chainlink dominates this space, controlling 84% of the oracle market. The Chainlink network generates revenue through two primary channels: on-chain fees for services used across various blockchain networks, and partnerships with large corporations that pay for Chainlink‚Äôs solutions. This revenue model supports its operations and facilitates buybacks of LINK tokens, further enhancing the network‚Äôs sustainability. Moreover, Chainlink‚Äôs protocol automatically converts all revenues‚Äîwhether in Ethereum (ETH) or Circle‚Äôs USDC stablecoin‚Äîfrom corporate partnerships into LINK tokens on the open market, depositing them into a strategic treasury. This mechanism not only strengthens the network‚Äôs financial foundation but also creates a persistent supply sink as users stake LINK to secure the network, earning a sustainable yield of approximately 4.32%. Deutscher emphasizes that this dynamic creates a powerful feedback loop: increased adoption leads to higher revenues, which in turn results in more LINK purchased and locked, enhancing network security and utility. In his analysis, Deutscher also drew comparisons between LINK and XRP, arguing that LINK has gained more traction within institutional circles than XRP, making it a more logical investment given its current valuation. For context, the total value secured by Chainlink stands at an impressive $84.65 billion, dwarfing XRP‚Äôs decentralized finance (DeFi) total value locked of approximately $85 million. Despite this disparity, XRP‚Äôs market cap is roughly twelve times larger than LINK‚Äôs, which Deutscher believes highlights LINK‚Äôs potential value at current levels. From a pricing perspective, Chainlink has recently broken above the $20 weekly resistance level, currently trading at $22.This is likened to Ethereum‚Äôs pivotal $4,000 level, indicating a potential upward trajectory for LINK in the coming months.

Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe. Photo: Collins President Michael D Higgins. Photo: PA Russian president Vladimir Putin will visit the US for the first time in a decade. Photo: Sputnik One has to admire the sunny disposition of Paschal Donohoe, who says the key to our success in the future will be dependent on increases in productivity (‚ÄòThe resilience of Irish enterprise and our workforce will see us through hard times‚Äô, Irish Independent, August 14). Working longer and harder for the same returns is unlikely to resonate with most people, particularly so with disruptive technologies such as AI and profound demo¬≠graphic trends affecting a multitude of industries. This comes on the back of a big increase of 12,700 in the seasonally adjusted number of people unemployed in July, with the unemployment rate rising to 4.9pc. Couple this with over 300,000 struggling to pay their electricity bills in the height of summer and the last thing anyone wants to hear is to work longer and harder. Why would a member of Generation Z, for example, want to increase their productivity when no matter what they do, they will never be able to afford a home or childcare? The only ones who really benefit from the younger generation working longer hours are the people who have it already made ‚Äì in other words, your typical Fine Gael or Fianna F√°il voter. Tom McElligott, Listowel, Co Kerry President Michael D Higgins has condemned recent attacks on Indian people living in Ireland as a ‚Äústark contradiction‚Äù to the values the Irish public hold dear (August 13). Unfortunately, it seems that those traditional values of welcome and openness to the stranger have been diminishing and even disappearing, to the point that they are being replaced by open hostility and violence. It can be argued that our tradition¬≠al welcome of ‚Äúc√©ad m√≠le f√°ilte‚Äù is more of a myth and make-believe to attract tourism rather than ever being embedded in our culture. Hostility against the Traveller community was and remains endemic in settled society. It is heartbreaking to have to listen to international protection applicants as they describe how they are taunted with racist slurs on our streets and how they fear going out alone in public places for fear of being assaulted. Our streets have become a hostile environment not only for our Indian community and asylum-seekers, but for the LGBTQ+ and other marginalised groups. This hostility bordering on hatred against the stranger is not confined just to our cities, but has taken root throughout the country. A few extra garda√≠ might contain the violence for a while, but a more radical approach to this epidimic of hostility is needed. Brendan Butler, Homefarm Road, Dublin 9 Catherine Prasifka‚Äôs article on clankers and the role of technology in our lives is spot on (‚ÄòIn a world of us and clankers, Big Tech is creating a future we haven‚Äôt consented to‚Äô, August 14). Lately, I‚Äôve noticed many people worrying that George Orwell‚Äôs Nineteen Eighty-Four has finally arrived, thanks to artificial intelligence, facial recognition and CCTV cameras everywhere. To them, I say, welcome to my childhood. At Tullysaran primary school in the 1960s, I was taught with great conviction that God saw everything I did, said and even thought. Compared with that, CCTV is a mere intrusion. At least cameras don‚Äôt claim to know what‚Äôs in my head. Enda Cullen, Tullysaran Road, Armagh When we think of cancer, we often think of it in statistics ‚Äì one in two of us will face it in our lifetimes ‚Äì but behind every diagnosis is a person, a story and a family. That human experience, along with the incredible progress of Irish-led ¬≠science, is at the heart of a new exhibition opening this week in Dublin. ‚ÄúCancer Revolution: Science, Innovation and Hope‚Äù is the first exhibition of its kind in Ireland, and it exists because we believe it‚Äôs time to change the public conversation about cancer. It brings together deeply personal items donated by people affected by the disease, alongside groundbreaking research, innovations in treatment and historical discoveries that have changed the face of medicine. This is not a story of despair, it is a story of resilience. The exhibition is free and open to the public from today until October 31 at Stephen‚Äôs Green Shopping Centre, Dublin. Orla Dolan, Breakthrough Cancer Research If today‚Äôs meeting between presidents Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump results in a repeat of Munich in 1938, then the dismemberment of Ukraine will not bring peace in eastern Europe, but a wider conflict and a repeat of mid-20th century worldwide war. Not only will Putin be rewarded for his blatant disregard for the rules-based order, but others such as China‚Äôs Xi and Trump will be encouraged to act in a similar manner. The EU must grow a backbone and reject, in the strongest terms possible, any concessions proposed to Russia and Putin. The only solution is a restoration of Ukrainian sovereignty over Crimea and Donbas, reparations to be paid by Russia for the damages and deaths caused by its illegal actions and the conviction of Putin for war crimes. The alternative is a world thrown into the chaos best described by Thomas Hobbes: nasty, brutish and short, where every man is enemy to every man. Bill Hawkes, Kilmihil, Co Clare Sixteen US congressmen and women stated ‚Äúserious concerns‚Äù regarding the Irish Government‚Äôs Occupied Territories Bill (‚ÄòGovernment to push ahead with Occupied Territories Bill‚Äô, August 9). As there are 435 congressmen and women in the House of Representatives, this equates to just over 3pc of US government elected officials. With such a small number, it is hardly worth our Government‚Äôs while to be concerned with their concerns in moving forward with this important humanitarian bill.

Two others from Canary Funds and Marinade Finance have also been delayed. Issued Thursday under delegated authority by the SEC‚Äôs Division of Trading and Markets, the orders use identical language for both filings. The orders cite the need for ‚Äúsufficient time to consider‚Äù proposed rule changes that would list Commodity-Based Trust Shares for each fund under BZX Rule 14.11(e)(4). That rule sets eligibility, disclosure, and surveillance requirements for exchange-traded products backed by physical commodities. "Even with market infrastructure for Solana maturing in terms of liquidity, custody solutions, and institutional interest, unresolved concerns around regulatory classification, network stability, and potential concentration of control within the ecosystem are still looming," Shawn Young, chief analyst at MEXC Research, told Decrypt. Both proposals were first filed on January 28 and later published in the Federal Register, opening the proposals for public comments and triggering the standard review clock under current rules in the Securities Exchange Act. A representative from Bitwise declined to comment pending the regulatory decision. The SEC and 21 Shares did not immediately respond to Decrypt's request for comment. After an initial extension in March and the opening of formal proceedings from May‚Äîwhen it similarly delayed the decisions‚Äîthe SEC has now used its final allowable 60-day delay, leaving no further procedural options beyond the new deadline. ‚ÄúThe SEC‚Äôs full extension likely stems from Solana‚Äôs still-shaky security-or-commodity status, a call that carries far more consequence than any other concern,‚Äù Vincent Liu, chief investment officer at Kronos Research, told Decrypt. ‚ÄúMarket manipulation and surveillance safeguards are also squarely in play, as both factors will set the tone for all future altcoin ETF bids.‚Äù For markets, this could sharpen positioning around Solana and influence expectations for other altcoin-linked ETFs, which are publicly traded funds designed to track the price of an underlying asset. ‚ÄúTraders will speculate and stack Solana to front-run the final call, while the deadline sets the stage for other altcoin-linked ETFs, shaping sentiment, and deciding whether Solana becomes the precedent or the pause button for the next wave of products,‚Äù Liu said. Applications for Solana ETFs follow the path set by spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, using the same Commodity-Based Trust Share framework and leaning on surveillance-sharing arrangements tied to CME Solana futures. The Solana ETF lineup awaiting a decision has widened in recent months, with additional proposals from Canary Funds and Marinade Finance joining those from Bitwise and 21Shares. Other issuers, including ProShares, Grayscale, and VanEck, have made technical amendments to their filings in an effort to align with the SEC‚Äôs criteria. BlackRock, meanwhile, has previously confirmed it has no plans to launch a Solana product yet, with some observers saying it‚Äôs likely because the asset management firm is already content with its Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs. With the final 60 days afforded to the SEC to make its decision, some are optimistic that a Solana ETF could be approved this year. ‚ÄúWe're expecting standard spot Solana ETFs to be approved by mid-October at the latest, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart tweeted Thursday.

Title: MSM Forced to Report That Ukrainian Forces Face Dire Lack of Manpower, as Millions of Citizens Will Not Fight for the Kiev Regime

Skip to comments. Posted on 08/14/2025 3:24:56 PM PDT by Kazan As we await US-Russia Alaska summit tomorrow (15), the MSM continues their painful process of recognizing the realities on the ground in the battlefields of Ukraine.One of the most difficult realities to face is the realization that literally millions of Ukrainian citizens will not fight for their country and hide from the conscription officers.More than half a million Ukrainian men of military age have fled the country, while many others are still in hiding.Add to that the desertion epidemic plaguing the Ukrainian forces, with hundreds of deserters abandoning their positions at the front every single day.Russian forces have breached Ukrainian defenses near Dobropillia and advanced nine miles into territory around the city of Pokrovsk.Ukraine deployed Azov brigade troops to face the attackers, but the situation remains ‚Äòchaotic‚Äô.The Telegraph reported:‚Äú‚ÄôThe entire defense line is like a sieve‚Äô, wrote Stansislav Bunyatov, a Ukrainian serviceman and blogger, a sentiment echoed by Borden Krotevhych, former chief of the Azov Brigade. Krotevhych wrote: ‚ÄòThis chaos has been growing for a long time, worsening with each passing day. A stable line of combat, as such, effectively doesn‚Äôt exist‚Äô.Ukraine is ‚Äòvisibly losing the war‚Äô, says Konrad Muzkya, a Polish military analyst, largely because of the manpower crisis. So why won‚Äôt men like Pavlo, 35 and a new father, enlist? ‚ÄòProbably because I am afraid‚Äô, he says, with disarming honesty.‚ÄòAfraid to die or, worse, lose my mind and become a burden to my family. Afraid to leave my family in poverty. Afraid that my daughter will grow up an orphan. Afraid of being captured and tortured for months‚Äô.‚ÄùAt this point in the war, besides the increasing troop shortage, Ukrainians have also lost the drone supremacy they had in the beginning of the war.‚ÄúWorse, Ukraine‚Äôs infantry is shrinking, with desertions and casualties exceeding the 200,000 mobilized last year. Around 650,000 men of fighting age are thought to have fled Ukraine. Others hide, like Pavlo, or bribe draft officers and army psychiatrists for health exemptions.[‚Ä¶] The desertion crisis is even starker. Unofficial estimates suggest more than 400 soldiers are abandoning the battlefield daily ‚Äì exhausted by years of war, frustrated by rigid, top-down command, and disheartened by those avoiding service.‚ÄùKiev command strips technical units to fill the gaps in the front line defenses, as vital mechanics and radar operators are sent to die as infantry.

The whole world should have been at war against Zelensky and his Nazi regime, that little pizzant dictator. He took away their elections, their freedom of speech, closed the churches, and sent hundreds of thousands of their people into a meatgrinder. And he stole gazillions of US dollars through the commie Biden regime. Hang them all. > Every dead Ukrainian and Russian man can be laid at the feet of the neocons, the RINOs That was their goal - dead white Christians. Mission accomplished. Don‚Äôt worry. Like Europe, whatever remains of Ukraine can be filled with Muslims. I hope that Trump is also aware of this situation despite Rubio‚Äôs false briefings. Zelensky is Jewish. His grandparents fought the Nazis in World War II. His great grandparents were killed by the Nazis. Yet the Jewish Zelensky is head of a Nazi regime? Riiiiight. Riiiiight. Been true for years. But it doesn‚Äôt seem to stop them. Russia has a similar problem but is still able to outman Ukraine. That was their goal - dead white Christians. Mission accomplished. I would like to see the fighting stopped today. How about you? There are plenty of fighting age Ukrainian men in Poland, driving around in nice cars. The natives are annoyed. fake news. Russia is on its last leg ‚ÄúUkraine is ‚Äòvisibly losing the war‚Äô, says Konrad Muzkya, a Polish military analyst, largely because of the manpower crisis. So why won‚Äôt men like Pavlo, 35 and a new father, enlist? ‚ÄòProbably because I am afraid‚Äô, he says, with disarming honesty. ‚ÄòAfraid to die or, worse, lose my mind and become a burden to my family. Afraid to leave my family in poverty. Afraid that my daughter will grow up an orphan. Afraid of being captured and tortured for months‚Äô.‚Äù‚Äù Which is why he‚Äôs now doing his part to put an end to this war. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry. Like Europe, whatever remains of Ukraine can be filled with Muslims.‚Äù That will certainly be the case if they join the EU, simply because WOMEN run the EU, many of them childless. ‚ÄúThe whole world should have been at war against Zelensky and his Nazi regime‚Äù GREAT POINT, and not only is Soros Jewish and spent WW2 ratting out other Jews for the Nazis, TO THIS DAY, he has no regrets about doing it.

Title: Saudi Aramco signs 11 bln USD lease-and-leaseback deal for Jafurah gas assets

Friday, 15 Aug 2025 RIYADH, Aug. 14 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Aramco announced Thursday the signing of an 11 billion U.S. dollar lease-and-leaseback agreement for its Jafurah gas processing assets with a consortium of international investors, marking a major inflow of foreign direct investment into the Kingdom's energy sector. The deal is led by funds managed by Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), a part of New York-based global investment management corporation BlackRock, the company revealed in a statement. Jafurah is the largest non-associated gas development in Saudi Arabia. It is a key component in Aramco's plans to increase gas production capacity by 60 percent between 2021 and 2030, to meet rising demand. As part of the transaction, a newly-formed subsidiary, Jafurah Midstream Gas Company (JMGC), will lease development and usage rights for the Jafurah Field Gas Plant and the Riyas NGL Fractionation Facility, and lease them back to Aramco for 20 years. JMGC will receive a tariff payable by Aramco in exchange for granting Aramco the exclusive right to receive, process, and treat raw gas from Jafurah. Aramco will hold a 51 percent majority stake in JMGC, with the remaining 49 percent held by investors led by GIP. The transaction, which will not impose any restrictions on Aramco's production volumes, is expected to close as soon as practicable, subject to customary closing conditions.

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Join the leading maritime news network A view of the Balboa Port is pictured after Hong Kong's CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a BlackRock Inc-backed consortium, amid pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to curb China's influence in the region, Panama City, Panama, March 4, 2025. REUTERS/Enea Lebrun By Shirley Zhao and Shawna Kwan (Bloomberg) ‚Äî CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd.‚Äôs profit fell 92% in the first half of the year, due to a one-time and non-cash loss on account of the merger of its telecommunications arm with Vodafone Group Plc. Billionaire Li Ka-shing‚Äôs flagship firm reported HK$852 million ($109 million) in net income for the six months ended June. Revenue came in at HK$240.7 billion, compared with HK$232.6 billion a year earlier. It announced an interim dividend of HK$0.710 per share, compared with HK$0.688 per share a year before. The profit drop is the biggest since a group-wide restructuring in 2015 for CK Hutchison, which is now led by Li‚Äôs son Victor Li. While its main operations including ports and retail remain resilient ‚Äî with underlying profit actually rising 11% from the year before ‚Äî the company recorded a one-time, non-cash loss of HK$10.5 billion arising from the UK merger, including non-cash disposal loss and transactional related expenses. The group completed the merger in May, receiving about ¬£1.3 billion ($1.8 billion) in net proceeds, it said in an earnings statement Thursday. The conglomerate has also been facing geopolitical headwinds. It missed a chance to complete a sale of 43 ports ‚Äî including two in the strategic Panama Canal ‚Äî to a consortium backed by American asset manager BlackRock Inc. before a window for exclusive talks expired late July. CK Hutchison said it may invite a major strategic investor from China to join the buyers group after Beijing expressed strong displeasure over the deal, which it sees as ceding its shipping and trade interest to US influence. State-owned China Cosco Shipping Corp. was negotiating a powerful role for itself as a condition to join the consortium, Bloomberg News reported in July. The company didn‚Äôt mention the ports deal in its earnings statement Thursday. The group is poised to gain more than $19 billion in cash if the agreement is completed. The buying consortium also includes Italian billionaire Gianluigi Aponte‚Äôs Terminal Investment Ltd. ‚ÄúGeopolitical uncertainty is likely to remain elevated,‚Äù said Chairman Victor Li. ‚ÄúThe global economic outlook in this half will continue to be uncertain and unpredictable, with persistent unresolved trade and fiscal and monetary policy issues affecting commodity prices, interest and currency rates, as well as consumer and business sentiment.‚Äù CK Hutchison has been active in mergers and acquisitions in recent months ‚Äî with mixed results. Subsidiary CK Infrastructure Holdings Ltd. has been seeking to bolster its UK assets after completing a second listing in London last year, but pulled out of the bidding for a liquefied natural gas terminal in the country valued at about ¬£2 billion, Bloomberg News reported this week. The company didn‚Äôt specify the reasons for its decision, which came after it said it was negotiating the final terms of a deal. An agreement was expected within days. CK Infrastructure has been in talks to sell British rolling stock leasing firm Eversholt Rail for as much as ¬£4 billion and expressed interest earlier this year in investing in debt-saddled Thames Water, though that didn‚Äôt develop into a ‚Äúprogressable proposal,‚Äù according to the water and sewage company‚Äôs management. The unit was also considering a bid for KKR & Co.-backed UK waste management firm Viridor Ltd., Bloomberg News reported in March. Details on sectoral performance: ¬© 2025 Bloomberg L.P.

A rally in European stocks slowed while US equities tread water as markets digested stronger-than-expected wholesale price inflation data and US bond yields rose. The Iseq index rose by 1.1 per cent, slightly outperforming its European peers. Cairn Homes jumped 2 per cent after lodging new plans for 236 apartments and 16 houses from D√∫n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council for its site at Chesterfield, Cross Avenue, Blackrock, Co Dublin. The Irish banks also moved higher as part of a wider sectoral move across Europe. AIB climbed 3.4 per cent to close at ‚Ç¨7.41 per share, while Bank of Ireland jumped 2.1 per cent to ‚Ç¨13.22. Ryanair also advanced, adding 0.6 per cent to ‚Ç¨26.30 per share while other large caps like Kingspan and Kerry Group were little changed. Adding to Wednesday‚Äôs 16 per cent surge, Glanbia added another 1.4 per cent to close at ‚Ç¨14.32 per share after the nutritionals group raised its earnings forecast earlier in the previous session. European shares touched two-week highs as the blue-chip Stoxx 50 added 0.7 per cent and the pan-European Stoxx 600 advanced by 0.5 per cent. Insurers were in the spotlight with the likes of Swiss Re reporting earnings. The firm was down 3.9 per cent on the session, despite reporting better than expected net profits for the first half. Meanwhile, Carlsberg fell 5.5 per cent after the Danish brewer missed half-year profit and volume forecasts, and said it did not expect any improvement in the consumer environment this year. Thyssenkrupp tumbled 8.9 per cent after the German conglomerate cut its full-year outlook for investments and sales, citing disruption from US tariffs. After three consecutive sessions of gains, British stocks were little changed, with the benchmark FTSE 100 essentially flat on the session and the mid-cap FTSE 250 index down by 0.2 per cent. Insurers led sectoral gains with Aviva jumping 2.4 per cent after jumping to its highest level since 2007 earlier in the session. The group raised its interim dividend on Thursday after reporting a stronger half-year operating profit. British insurer Admiral hit a record high, rising 5.8 per cent after a strong first-half profit. The energy sector was the main drag on the FTSE 100, down 1.3 per cent Harbour Energy led the losses, falling 4.5 per cent, while oil majors Shell and BP fell by 1.5 per cent and 0.9 per cent. Industrial metal miners also retreated amid weakness in copper and iron ore prices, with Rio Tinto down by 4 per cent and Anglo American down by 1.7 per cent. Among individual stocks, British Gas owner Centrica rose 2.5 per cent after announcing it will jointly buy National Grid‚Äôs Grain LNG terminal with US-based Energy Capital Partners for about ¬£1.5 billion (‚Ç¨1.7 billion). Wall Street‚Äôs main indices were little changed in early trading on Thursday despite a stronger-than-anticipated inflation reading that spurred a rise in bond yields and the dollar. US wholesale inflation accelerated in July by the most in three years, suggesting companies are passing along higher import costs related to tariffs, raising the spectre of renewed price pressures and causing traders to trim bets on the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates next month. After a recent rocket-fuelled rally, the S&P 500 was flat despite gains in big tech stocks. Cisco Systems lost 1 per cent after the network equipment manufacturer‚Äôs broadly in-line forecast did little to encourage investors. Deere & Co fell 8 per cent after the farm-equipment maker reported a lower quarterly profit and tightened its annual profit forecast, while Tapestry plunged 17.6 per cent after the Coach handbag maker forecast annual profit below estimates. ‚Äì Additional reporting: Reuters/Bloomberg Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Sign up to the Business Today newsletter for the latest new and commentary in your inbox Listen to Inside Business podcast for a look at business and economics from an Irish perspective Ian Curran is a Business reporter with The Irish Times Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning ¬© 2025 The Irish Times DAC
