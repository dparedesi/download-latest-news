Investment activity in digital assets surged almost throughout October, as crypto investment products, especially that of Bitcoin, experienced substantial inflows, according to the latest data released by CoinShares. Last week alone, global crypto funds attracted $901 million in net inflows, pushing the total for the month to $3.4 billion. According to CoinShares, out of the total fund flows recorded, Bitcoin-centric investment products captured the lion’s share of inflows, with $920 million in net additions over the past week. US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded $997.6 million in net inflows, led largely by BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). Bitcoin’s dominance was notable, with blockchain equities and Solana-based products also seeing inflows of $12.2 million and $10.8 million, respectively. However, other Bitcoin-based products, including those outside US markets, faced some net outflows. While Bitcoin maintained strong inflows, Ethereum-based funds recorded net outflows of $34.7 million last week, signaling a decrease in investor interest. CoinShares reported that Ethereum’s price ratio to Bitcoin had fallen to its lowest point since April 2021, which could be contributing to this outflow trend. The data suggests that while Ethereum has seen gains in the past, investors are now focusing more on Bitcoin, possibly anticipating future regulatory clarity and further mainstream adoption with developments like spot ETFs. Geographically, US-based crypto funds attracted a substantial $906 million in net inflows last week. In contrast, other regions saw mixed results, with funds based in Sweden, Canada, Brazil, and Hong Kong collectively experiencing $29.1 million in net outflows. This difference highlights the United States’ growing role in shaping the global crypto investment market, especially as American firms like BlackRock and Fidelity expand their crypto offerings. According to CoinShares’ Head of Research, James Butterfill reveals that the we political climate likely influences the recent Bitcoin price movements and increase in inflows. He noted that Republican gains in the polls correlate with increased interest in Bitcoin investments. This suggests that market participants may see a shift in political power as favourable to digital assets, potentially driving anticipation of regulatory reforms or even greater crypto acceptance. CoinShares report shows that the October influx represents roughly 12% of assets under management (AUM) in digital asset funds and marks the fourth-largest month for inflows on record. This brings the year-to-date total to $27 billion, almost tripling the previous high of $10.5 billion set in 2021.

Meet Samuel Edyme, Nickname - HIM-buktu. A web3 content writer, journalist, and aspiring trader, Edyme is as versatile as they come. With a knack for words and a nose for trends, he has penned pieces for numerous industry player, including AMBCrypto, Blockchain.News, and Blockchain Reporter, among others. Edyme’s foray into the crypto universe is nothing short of cinematic. His journey began not with a triumphant investment, but with a scam. Yes, a Ponzi scheme that used crypto as payment roped him in. Rather than retreating, he emerged wiser and more determined, channeling his experience into over three years of insightful market analysis. Before becoming the voice of reason in the crypto space, Edyme was the quintessential crypto degen. He aped into anything that promised a quick buck, anything ape-able, learning the ropes the hard way. These hands-on experience through major market events—like the Terra Luna crash, the wave of bankruptcies in crypto firms, the notorious FTX collapse, and even CZ’s arrest—has honed his keen sense of market dynamics. When he isn’t crafting engaging crypto content, you’ll find Edyme backtesting charts, studying both forex and synthetic indices. His dedication to mastering the art of trading is as relentless as his pursuit of the next big story. Away from his screens, he can be found in the gym, airpods in, working out and listening to his favorite artist, NF. Or maybe he’s catching some Z’s or scrolling through Elon Musk’s very own X platform—(oops, another screen activity, my bad…) Well, being an introvert, Edyme thrives in the digital realm, preferring online interaction over offline encounters—(don’t judge, that’s just how he is built). His determination is quite unwavering to be honest, and he embodies the philosophy of continuous improvement, or “kaizen,” striving to be 1% better every day. His mantras, “God knows best” and “Everything is still on track,” reflect his resilient outlook and how he lives his life. In a nutshell, Samuel Edyme was born efficient, driven by ambition, and perhaps a touch fierce. He’s neither artistic nor unrealistic, and certainly not chauvinistic. Think of him as Bruce Willis in a train wreck—unflappable. Edyme is like trading in your car for a jet—bold. He’s the guy who’d ask his boss for a pay cut just to prove a point—(uhhh…). He is like watching your kid take his first steps. Imagine Bill Gates struggling with rent—okay, maybe that’s a stretch, but you get the idea, yeah. Unbelievable? Yes. Inconceivable? Perhaps. Edyme sees himself as a fairly reasonable guy, albeit a bit stubborn. Normal to you is not to him. He is not the one to take the easy road, and why would he? That’s just not the way he roll. He has these favorite lyrics from NF’s “Clouds” that resonate deeply with him: “What you think's probably unfeasible, I've done already a hundredfold.” PS—Edyme is HIM. HIM-buktu. Him-mulation. Him-Kardashian. Himon and Pumba. He even had his DNA tested, and guess what? He’s 100% Him-alayan. Screw it, he ate the opp. Disclaimer: The information found on NewsBTC is for educational purposes only.

Title: Bitcoin spikes to $71,500, 4% away from all-time high

Share this article Bitcoin has rallied over 5% to $71,500 and is now within striking distance of its all-time high of $73,700. The surge comes as the US presidential election is just days away. According to data from CoinGecko, the largest crypto asset by market cap broke the $70,000 price level on Monday after a minor correction last week, mostly driven by the escalating conflict in the Middle East and alleged regulatory scrutiny over Tether. Despite a sudden drop below $66,000, Bitcoin bounced back and consolidated within the $67,000-$68,000 range over the weekend. It ultimately broke out and soared to $70,000 for the first time in over four months. According to seasoned trader Peter Brandt, the post-halving advance may have started and Bitcoin may be entering a bullish phase. “The 5-month inverted expanding triangle has now been completed. Follow through will be important. The post-halving advance may have begun. The series of lower highs and lower lows since March has come to an end,” Brandt said in a recent post on X. As Crypto Briefing previously reported, certain key metrics pointed to a potential upward trend in the price of Bitcoin. The Bollinger Bands, an indicator used to assess price volatility, are at one of their tightest points in history. This “Bollinger Squeeze” often precedes periods of low volatility, which can lead to powerful price breakouts. In addition, the Miner Position Index (MPI), which measures the flow of Bitcoin from miners to exchanges, shows that Bitcoin miners are currently in an accumulation phase, while block rewards are on the rise. The combination of a low MPI and rising block rewards suggests a bullish outlook for Bitcoin. Demand for Bitcoin ETFs remains strong. According to data tracked by Farside Investors, US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded approximately $3 billion in net inflows in the last two weeks. These ETFs started this week on a high note, collectively drawing around $479 million in net capital with no outflows reported. BlackRock continued its Bitcoin buying spree, logging over $315 million in net buying on Monday. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan sees reaccelerating Bitcoin ETF inflows among key factors that could propel Bitcoin to six-figure prices, together with the upcoming presidential election, increasing whale accumulation, reduced Bitcoin supply post-halving, and global monetary adjustments. Analysts at Standard Chartered project that Bitcoin could reach approximately $73,000 by Election Day on November 5. Plus, the analysts suggest that if former President Donald Trump wins the election, Bitcoin may surge to around $80,000, with a potential increase of up to $125,000 by the end of the year if Republicans secure control of Congress. Analysts at Bitfinex also anticipate that the US presidential election could serve as a catalyst for Bitcoin’s rally, potentially pushing its price beyond $73,666 due to heightened market activity and volatility surrounding the election. Meanwhile, several other experts believe that Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory remains intact regardless of the electoral outcome. Steven Lubka, head of private clients at Swan Bitcoin, anticipates that Bitcoin will hit six-figure prices due to its strong correlation with fiscal and monetary conditions rather than political leadership.

Title: FET: a pathway to endless opportunities for students
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/education/2024/10/29/fet-a-pathway-that-provides-opportunities/
Time Published: 2024-10-29T03:15:00Z
Full Content:
It gets less fanfare than the CAO, but further education and training (FET) offers a range of career-focused options for school-leavers – and it would be a mistake not to explore them. Over the past few years, I’ve spoken with countless students who thrived in apprenticeships, post-Leaving Cert (PLC) courses and traineeships. Some were high achievers who fell short of the points needed for their degree programme, and did a year-long PLC in a local college of further education, which opened the door to their CAO course of choice. Others wanted a vocational, work-ready qualification and found it in an apprenticeship, allowing them to earn as they learned. One student got great results in his Leaving Cert, but decided that a year in a PLC would serve as a bridge between school and college. “One in 10 adults in Ireland – around 423,000 people – were engaged in FET courses and apprenticeships last year,” says Maria Walshe, director of branding, communications and FET strategy implementation at Solas. “Fast becoming a prime destination for school-leavers, increasing numbers of students are now choosing the FET route. Last year, for example, course enrolments were up 11 per cent year on year for QQI level five and six courses, also known as PLCs.” Walshe says that not only is FET a smart choice for school-leavers in its own right, but also a pathway that provides opportunities that can take learners directly into careers, as well as offering progression routes to higher education. “For those unsure of their next step after school, FET can provide students with the option to set their own pace and to explore a subject or interest before applying to a four-year degree.” Paige Tomlin, a 19-year-old school-leaver, is doing a PLC course in computer science at Blackrock College of Further Education. “I was one of the fortunate students to be offered computer science as a Leaving Cert subject, and I really enjoyed it,” she says. “I loved the coding aspect and knew that this was an area I would like to work in. But I didn’t do well enough in my Leaving Cert to get the points. In my research, I learned that the PLC could be a gateway for computer science in TU Dublin or DCU, so I went for it. “The course involves five days a week of classes, but it’s not too intense as there are gaps between some of the lectures. It also includes work experience hours, and there’s even an opportunity to go on an eight-day course in Portugal. “There’s coding, maths, web development, databases, spreadsheets and communications – where we have had a chance to work on our CVs – on the course so, although I do want to go to college, there are also opportunities for us to go straight into the workforce.” Unlike third level, the fees are minimal, and this year Tomlin only had to pay a €50 registration fee. (It should be noted that some PLCs, particularly in art and design, may require students to buy equipment or supplies, and so can end up costing more). Tomlin says that she has really enjoyed the course. “We’ve done collaborative work in group projects, and we’ve worked solo. I’ve made friends on the course and am really glad I took it on.” The possibilities are endless with FET, says Walshe. “They take students into a diverse range of exciting careers, through courses in areas as diverse as commis chef, animal care, games production, cyber security, personal training and applied science. “The beauty of FET is that it is for everyone. Available in every county and delivered by the FET colleges under the provision of the 16 Education and Training Boards (ETBs) across the country, FET can take students into a world of careers, all without the need to travel far from home. FET courses are available in every county and delivered by the FET colleges under the provision of the 16 education and training boards (ETBs) across the country. “FET can take students into a world of careers, all without the need to travel far from home,” says Walshe. “There are many opportunities for students to discover FET courses on offer in their local community, as well as pathways from FET to university. Open days are run by FET colleges on an ongoing basis and are definitely worth checking out.” Your regular guide to the latest education news, analysis and opinion, as well as classroom resources, posters and lots more © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Are ‘ETF Paper Bitcoins’ Suppressing BTC Prices? Analyst Provides Answers
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/etf-paper-bitcoin-suppressing-btc-prices-analyst/
Time Published: 2024-10-28T22:30:17Z
Full Content:
In a new YouTube video titled “There Is No ETF Paper Bitcoin,” Fred Krueger, an investor at the crypto hedge fund 2718.fund, delved into the growing concerns surrounding US spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and their impact on the cryptocurrency’s price. Krueger aimed to dispel the fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) that have been circulating about “paper Bitcoin”—the notion that ETFs might be selling Bitcoin they do not actually possess—and to explain why Bitcoin’s price has not surged as dramatically as some might expect, despite significant ETF purchases. Krueger began his analysis by acknowledging the prevalent skepticism in the market. “There’s all this paper Bitcoin, and ETFs don’t really have the Bitcoin, and if they were buying all this Bitcoin, how come Bitcoin price is not higher?” he stated, encapsulating the core concerns of many investors. Historically, the concept of “paper Bitcoin” has been associated with exchanges that sold Bitcoin to customers without actually possessing the underlying assets. Krueger highlighted several high-profile instances where this practice led to significant losses for investors. He cited the case of Mt. Gox. Another example he provided was QuadrigaCX, a Canadian exchange that collapsed under mysterious circumstances. Founder Gerald Cotten allegedly died in India, taking with him the private keys to the exchange’s cold wallets, effectively locking away customer funds. “A lot of Canadians lost all their Bitcoin on this Quad exchange,” Krueger noted. These historical events have contributed to the current apprehension about ETFs and the possibility that they might be engaging in similar practices—selling Bitcoin they do not actually hold, thereby suppressing BTC’s price through artificial supply. However, Krueger argued that ETFs, particularly those managed by established financial institutions, operate under a fundamentally different framework compared to unregulated exchanges. Focusing on two leading ETFs—IBIT, the BlackRock ETF, and FBTC, the Fidelity ETF—Krueger emphasized the stringent regulatory oversight governing these entities. “Both of these ETFs are subject to very strict regulatory oversight, including the SEC but also other agencies in the US,” he stated. This comprehensive oversight includes requirements for complete transparency, regular audits, and the use of third-party custodians for asset verification. “They literally have to get a receipt of an asset from a third-party custodian,” Krueger added. In the case of IBIT, Coinbase serves as the third-party custodian. “Coinbase is itself a public company that is audited,” Krueger pointed out, noting that the public nature of Coinbase adds an additional layer of scrutiny and accountability. IBIT conducts audits of Coinbase, and both entities are subject to audits by the SEC and other regulatory bodies. For FBTC, custody is handled by Fidelity Digital Assets, a separate entity within Fidelity that specializes in the custody of digital assets, thereby ensuring specialized oversight and management. “The issuers of IBIT and FBTC are BlackRock and Fidelity, two of the largest and oldest financial institutions, and they have a vested interest in maintaining their reputation,” Krueger asserted. “Their reputation is at stake, and this is a big deal,” he emphasized, suggesting that these institutions would not risk their credibility by engaging in the sale of non-existent Bitcoin. Krueger contrasted BlackRock with entities like QuadrigaCX to underscore the disparity in regulatory compliance and operational scale. “BlackRock is highly regulated […] BlackRock has a robust corporate governance structure with committees for audit, risk, and compliance and very extensive internal controls,” Krueger added. Addressing the core concern about ETFs holding “paper Bitcoin,” Krueger provided specific data to refute this notion. “The reality is the ETFs have zero pure paper Bitcoin,” he stated unequivocally. He highlighted that IBIT holds approximately 403,000 actual Bitcoins, while FBTC holds about 185,000 actual Bitcoins. “Together, these two ETFs hold almost 3% of the world’s total Bitcoin, or 588,000 Bitcoins—I think it’s 2.9%,” he calculated. Krueger acknowledged that some skeptics have attempted to analyze Bitcoin movement between specific dates to challenge these holdings. However, he emphasized that the facts are clear and verifiable. “We know how much Bitcoin these ETFs have; we know that it’s accounted for, and that’s a reality,” he insisted. Turning to the question of why Bitcoin’s price has not increased more dramatically despite significant ETF inflows, Krueger offered a nuanced explanation. He noted that Bitcoin is, in fact, up by 60% since the introduction of the ETFs, translating to a $600 billion increase in market capitalization. This growth has been fueled by approximately $20 billion in net inflows into the ETFs, resulting in a price multiplier effect of about 30x. “That’s historically about normal, maybe a little on the low side but not terribly so,” he assessed. Krueger attributed the moderation in Bitcoin’s price growth to substantial selling pressures from various sources. “There’s been a bunch of selling,” he explained. He detailed that Germany sold $3 billion worth of Bitcoin as well as Mt. Gox holdings. Additionally, FTX sold its GBTC (Grayscale Bitcoin Trust) stake earlier in the year, and the Digital Currency Group (DCG) sold assets to resolve lawsuits. “We had a lot of selling,” Krueger summarized. Speculating on the potential impact absent these selling pressures, Krueger suggested that Bitcoin’s price could have been significantly higher. “We probably would be at $90k if there wasn’t any selling,” he posited. At press time, BTC traded at $68,752. Jake Simmons, a dedicated crypto journalist, has been passionate about Bitcoin since 2016 when he first learned about it.

Title: Poll: One in Three Say Migration Should Be Top Priority for the President's First 100 Days in 2025
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2024/10/28/poll-one-three-say-migration-top-priority-presidents-first-100-days-2025/
Time Published: 2024-10-28T21:54:26Z

Thirty-five percent of Americans say the top priority for the first 100 days of the next presidency should be migration, according to an Ipsos survey for Reuters. That one-on-three score is more than three times the 11 percent share of the second-ranked “First 100 Days” priority — income inequality. Taxes — and health care — score only a 10 percent share. The priority rankings are very different from what voters say when they are asked about the most important issues, Ipsos noted: The economy is the seen as the most important problem [for Washington, DC] for 27% of registered voters, followed by political extremism or threats to democracy (22%), and then immigration (16%). The First 100 Days answer suggests that President Kalama Harris might quickly press Congress to pass a law that would raise immigration levels under the guise of improving border security. But those survey results also suggest that a reelected President Donald Trump will face pressure to focus on curbing migration. That focus would be different from his first term when he quickly pivoted away from migration and pushed a large tax cut through Congress. That 2017 shift followed pressure from Trump’s business allies, many who still demand that government invite more economic migrants. “The U.S. economy needs immigration, and the ebb and flow of humans [across the border] is the market responding to demand,” the Wall Street Journal declared Sunday. “The Biden administration’s decision to use legal parole to accept 30,000 migrants a month from Venezuela, Cuba, Haiti, and Nicaragua is a common-sense and humane approach to managing migration,” it declared. If Trump is in the Oval Office, Democrats — and some Republicans — will resist his promise of mass deportations. But many Republicans recognize they need to fulfill campaign promises. “There’s about 4.5 million who would be the first priority for that, people who’ve already committed crimes,” House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) said on October 24. “They’re in the system now [for] shoplifting, or whatever it is … or [having] done things that are untoward or unlawful.” “We’ve got 20, 25 million illegal aliens who are here in the country. What do we do with them?” Sen. JD Vance said in his October 1 Vice Presidential debate. “I think the first thing that we do is we start with the criminal migrants. About a million of those people have committed some form of crime, in addition to crossing the border illegally.” Any debate about migration levels will likely include a debate over the damage caused to ordinary Americans’ workplace productivity and their declining family fertility. In Canada and the United Kingdom, birth rates have crashed amid wage cuts and housing spikes caused by advocates for more migration. Bloomberg reported Monday: The fertility rate in England Wales fell to a record low in 2023, as financial pressures and wider societal shifts put young people off starting a family. Women had an average of 1.44 children, the lowest figure since records began in 1938 and down sharply since 2010 when the rate was 1.94, data from the Office for National Statistics showed on Monday. In London the rate was even lower at 1.35. The figures will set off alarm bells over a worsening demographic crisis that is set to ramp up the pressure on the workforce and the public finances. The national level is well below the natural replacement rate of 2.1 In contrast, Larry Fink, the head of the $10 trillion Blackrock investment group, has urged governments to reduce the migration that is used to inflate their consumer economies and to instead raise the productivity of their nation’s citizens. “We always used to think [a] shrinking population is a cause for negative [economic] growth,” Fink said at a pro-globalist event in April hosted by the World Economic Forum in Saudi Arabia. He continued: But in my conversations with the leadership of these large, developed countries [such as China, and Japan] that have xenophobic anti-immigration policies, they don’t allow anybody to come in — [so they have] shrinking demographics — these countries will rapidly develop robotics and AI and technology … If a promise of all that transforms productivity, which most of us think it will [emphasis added] — we’ll be able to elevate the standard living in countries, the standard of living for individuals, even with shrinking populations. Canada’s government has recently trimmed its massive immigration inflow, boosting bankers’ hopes that Canadian companies will redirect funds to raise the nation’s stalled productivity. “We need to dispel the narrative that slower population growth will be bad for the economy,” said an October 24 report by Robert Kavcic, the senior economist at BMO, a major bank based in Montreal. “Real GDP per capita has been stagnant on balance since 2016 … One can argue that the surge in [migrants] has diverted resources to housing and allowed firms to lean on low-cost labour, at the expense of productivity,” Kavcic wrote.

Title: Alternative Assets Shine Amid Pre-Election Market Uncertainty

Investmments and asset allocation concept. Where to Invest? Newspaper and direction sign with ... [+] investment options. 3d illustration With only one week remaining before the U.S. presidential election, there’s a growing sense of uncertainty in the air. Investors are wondering how to position their money, bracing for the possibility of significant volatility and market shifts. While some hedge funds are making bold moves on so-called “Trump trades,” we at U.S. Global Investors see things differently. In fact, I share billionaire hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones’ recent outlook on gold and Bitcoin (which validates what I have been writing about for many years). Like him, we currently favor alternative assets as the smart play going forward. It’s not that we’re betting against stocks or the economy, which we believe will do well over time no matter who wins the White House next month. Nevertheless, the writing is clearly on the wall: Ballooning U.S. debt and geopolitical tensions all point to the need for a strong hedge. You won’t be surprised to read that the U.S. debt situation has spiraled out of control. Just 25 years ago, the national debt was a little under 60% of GDP. Today, that rate has doubled to 120%. According to Paul Tudor Jones, founder and CEO of Tudor Investment Corp., this puts the U.S. in a precarious position—one that’s unsustainable in the long run unless serious action is taken to rein in government spending. We all know that politicians have a knack for promising more spending (in the Democrats’ case) or tax cuts (in the Republicans’ case) to keep voters happy. It’s easy to see why Jones is concerned that either approach will only exacerbate the debt problem. As he pointed out, the U.S. is “going to be broke really quick unless we get serious about dealing with our spending issues.” That’s not just a dramatic soundbite—it’s a reality check. The federal deficit for 2024 soared above $1.8 trillion, up 8% from the previous year. Meanwhile, the debt burden, which is rapidly nearing $36 trillion, shows no signs of easing. U.S. deficit spending continues to spiral out of control When the government keeps printing money to finance its spending, the inevitable result is inflation. And in times of inflation, the purchasing power of traditional assets like bonds erodes. That’s why Jones favors assets that perform well in inflationary environments such as gold, silver, commodities and Bitcoin. I agree wholeheartedly with this assessment. Think about it: Why would you want to own fixed-income assets when interest rates are being adjusted and are likely to be lower than the inflation rate? Long-dated bonds are particularly vulnerable. U.S. banks, remember, are still dealing with billions of dollars in unrealized losses on their fixed-income positions. According to Florida Atlantic University’s bank screener, Bank of America’s unrealized losses on held-to-maturity investments in the first quarter were a staggering $110 billion, more than any other U.S. institution by far. The Fed will likely try to “inflate” its way out of this mess, meaning it will keep nominal interest rates lower than inflation to support economic growth. For investors, this means that preserving wealth will require smart positioning in alternative assets. Jones is already betting against the bond market— “I am clearly not going to own any fixed-income,” he told CNBC last week—and I believe many investors would be wise to take a similar approach. Let’s start with gold and silver. Both have been go-to haven assets for centuries, and for good reason. When geopolitical tensions have risen, when inflation has reared its ugly head and/or when there’s been uncertainty in the markets, investors have flocked to gold and silver. This year is no exception. We’ve seen gold shatter records multiple times in 2024, with prices rising more than 32% year-to-date, the metal’s best annual growth since 1979. According to data from the World Gold Council, gold has consistently outperformed both inflation and the growth rate of the world economy. From 1971 to 2023, gold’s compound annual growth rate (CAGR) was 8%, compared to 4% for the U.S. consumer price index (CPI) and 7.8% for global GDP growth. Gold has kept pace with global GDP and exceeded inflation Silver, often dubbed the “poor man’s gold,” is another asset that deserves attention. With its industrial applications, especially in the green energy sector, silver has strong potential for future growth. According to one projection, the clean energy transition could dramatically increase the demand for silver in photovoltaic (PV) technology, potentially consuming between 85% and a jaw-dropping 98% of current global silver reserves by 2050. Now, let’s talk about Bitcoin. The world’s largest digital asset has quickly become a preferred store of value for many investors, especially those looking to hedge against fiat currency depreciation. Nearly half of all traditional hedge funds currently maintain exposure to cryptos, including Bitcoin. Institutions are also backing Bitcoin with the same enthusiasm. Just look at BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF. It’s one of the fastest-growing ETFs in financial history, with assets under management now over $26 billion. That’s no small feat. Bitcoin’s decentralized nature, capped supply and growing institutional acceptance make it an attractive asset in times of uncertainty. Like gold, it’s a hedge against inflation, but it also offers the potential for significant upside as more investors and institutions recognize its value. Now, I know many of you are wondering: “What about the election? What if Trump wins? What if Harris wins?” Here’s a news flash for you: Over the long run, it may not matter as much as you think. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, made a great point recently when he said that he’s “tired of hearing this is the biggest election in your lifetime. The reality is over time, it doesn’t matter.” While hedge funds are taking positions in “Trump trades” like private prisons and fossil fuels, we believe that trying to time the market based on election outcomes is a risky game. Yes, the election will cause short-term volatility, but if you’re in the right assets—like gold, silver and Bitcoin—I believe you’ll be well-positioned to weather the storm. One Community.

Title: Is NVIDIA (NVDA) The Best Performing Large-Cap Stock in the Last 3 Years?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best-Performing S&P 500 Stocks in the Last 3 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other best performing S&P 500 stocks in the last year. The past three years have been a bit of a roller coaster ride for the stock market. We saw how the pandemic wrecked several industries’ balance sheets and supply chains. Following the global vaccination drive, economies around the world and in the US opened up with a vengeance, resulting in huge stimulus checks. This, along with the energy and food-price shock and disrupted supply chains, was blamed for the persistently high inflation, which peaked at 9.1% in June 2022. The Fed had already started hiking interest rates to ease inflation and work towards a soft landing, with the first hike coming in March 2022. By July 2023, the central bank had raised it to 5.25-5.50%, making borrowing all the more challenging. The tech industry had kept the momentum from 2020 lockdowns well into 2021. The largest tech companies out of the 500 biggest companies trading in the US grew by an average of 33% from the start of 2021 to the end. However, the tech industry was heavily impacted by the rate hikes that followed in 2022. This resulted in the large-cap aggregate tech indices losing nearly 29% of the gains made in the year prior, as prospects for growth became bleak. The upper percentiles of the energy industry in market cap had a similar run in 2021 but remained immune to the economic downturn that followed in 2022, posting gains of 59% for the year. The aggressive rally in the energy industry resulted from a combination of supply-chain disruptions, OPEC production cuts, the Russia-Ukraine war, and the revision of energy sourcing in Europe, directing much of the energy capital inflow to the US from the continent. Coming back to tech – the industry wouldn’t stay on the sidelines for long. The start of 2023 to the end saw the large-cap US-traded tech equity grow by 38.6%. At the core of the resurgence was the AI-led boom combined with semiconductor supply chains that had recovered substantially by then. Other factors included CHIPS and Science Act, improved efficiency in the industry, and a rate-hike slowdown. The US economy looks to be on schedule for a soft landing, according to a Financial Times’ survey of economists. This is on the back of the Fed’s rate reduction of 50 basis points in September 2024, which, as noted by the CFO of a large US bank Denis Colman, is a signal towards a soft landing. This is not a sure shot, however, since some experts remain wary and continue worrying about a recession. For instance, Piper Sandler’s Chief Global Economist Nancy Lazar noted that the “jumbo” rate cut by the Fed is reminiscent of the similar Fed policy easing of 2001 and 2007, which couldn’t avert the problem. However, according to analysts, the case for a soft landing appears to be justified given the September jobs report and other improving indicators. The September report by BLS shows that the non-farm payrolls grew by 254,000 for the month, exceeding economists’ estimates by 41%. Moreover, the July and August reports, which had spooked some economists, were also revised by a combined 72,000 new hires, which wasn’t without historical precedent. Further, grocery prices, adjusted for growth in real wages, are back to the pre-pandemic levels. It took 3.59 hours of work to afford a week’s worth of groceries in November 2019 and took 3.57 hours of work to afford them in September 2024. Moving ahead, Rob Rowe, Regional Research Director and Head of Global Strategy at a large US bank is ‘tactically bullish’ on the back of continuing tech recovery and the markets “pricing in a soft landing”. They expect at-least 25 basis-point rate cuts at each Fed meeting through year-end. With regards to tech industry, their outlook suggests selectivity. In response to a question about their outlook on the tech industry, they said: “I think we have to be selective here. We like Semis as a recovery play but we’re kind of underweight on software.” Rowe has a bearish outlook on oil, given geopolitical variables don’t change in a way that leads to oil prices shooting up. For our list, we have picked stocks from the index in question that have had the highest 3-year annualized returns and we ranked them as such, in order of their 3-year CAGR. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. 3Y CAGR: 82.08% NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), for all intents and purposes, is considered the driving force behind the AI boom, especially on the hardware side. Nvidia’s core business revolves around designing Graphic Processing Units (GPUs). The company’s biggest market is the gaming industry since GPUs are almost essential for high-performance rendering due to their parallel processing capabilities. As it turns out, GPUs are also incredibly useful for training AI models for the same reason, since AI models require a lot of matrix calculations simultaneously. It goes without saying that Nvidia isn’t the sole GPU designer but what put it at an advantage over its competitors is its proprietary parallel computing platform – CUDA. Having a GPU market share of 70.5% as of 2016, Nvidia recognized the need for a programmable architecture very early since programming parallel processing is recognized as notoriously difficult. The CUDA platform is now supported by a library of thousands of specific applications, which makes it hard to compete with Nvidia in the space of parallel programming platforms. This, coupled with the explosive demand for GPUs for training AI models, resulted in NVDA becoming the most valuable company in the world in June 2024 before Apple regained the top spot for itself. NVDA grew at an annualized rate of 82% over the past three years, and has gained nearly 212% over the past year and 184% year-to-date. Nvidia’s highly anticipated GPU – Blackwell – is expected to offer substantial inference performance gains over its previous GPUs, and is already experiencing a high level of demand from hyperscalers. The GPU will be rolled out in Q4, 2024, but has already been booked out for 12 months. This is what Stacy Rasgon, a Bernstein senior analyst, had to say about NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) in one of the latest CNBC programs: “People are getting excited about the story again as we approach earnings, year-end, and next year when the new platform with Blackwell starts to ramp up. By all indications—based on supply chain checks and everything else—demand for this product looks off the charts.” The analyst believes the stock is trading at a discount: “It’s much cheaper today than it was before the run started a year and a half ago. The stock has risen significantly, but earnings have increased even more than the stock.” Overall, NVDA ranks 2nd on our list of best performing S&P 500 stocks in the last year. While we acknowledge the potential of the best-performing S&P500 stocks in the Last 3 Years, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: BlackRock Now Holding 403,725 Bitcoin (BTC) Worth $26,980,000,000 After Accumulation Spree

BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world, is now holding tens of billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin (BTC), the firm’s data shows. According to the asset management’s disclosures, BlackRock holds 403,725 BTC worth $26.98 billion in its iShares Bitcoin Trust exchange-traded fund (ETF). Blockchain tracking firm Lookonchain says that in the last two weeks alone, BlackRock has gobbled up 34,085 BTC worth $2.3 billion. The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) went live on January 5th of this year and has since delivered 44.80% returns as of September 30th. In a recent report, BlackRock, a firm with over $10 trillion in assets under management, said that Bitcoin could act as a hedge against the United States’ mounting debt and other macroeconomic concerns. “While Bitcoin has shown instances of short-term co-movements with equities and other ‘risk assets,’ over the longer term its fundamental drivers are starkly different, and in many cases inverted versus most traditional investment assets. As the global investment community grapples with rising geopolitical tensions, concerns over the state of US debt and deficits and increased political instability around the world, Bitcoin may be seen as an increasingly unique diversifier against some of these fiscal, monetary and geopolitical risk factors investors may face elsewhere in their portfolio.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $67,735.

Title: BlackRock’s Bitcoin holdings near Satoshi’s – Is a BTC battle brewing?

BlackRock’s Bitcoin accumulation signals a bullish trend for Bitcoin. Amid growing speculation that Bitcoin [BTC] ETFs may soon surpass the holdings of Satoshi Nakamoto, BlackRock has hit a significant milestone in its BTC accumulation. According to a recent update from Lookonchain, the asset management giant now holds over 400,000 Bitcoin. At press time, it was valued at approximately $26.98 billion. Source: Lookonchain/X Over the past two weeks alone, BlackRock has added 34,085 BTC to its portfolio, worth roughly $2.3 billion. This latest acquisition highlighted BlackRock’s dominance in the cryptocurrency space as it continues to expand its Bitcoin holdings. On the flip side, BlackRock’s BTC ETF (IBIT) has seen remarkable growth, surpassing the $23 billion mark, according to Farside Investors. Notably, IBIT has been on a consistent inflow streak since the 14th of October. Between the 14th and 25th October, IBIT recorded inflows nearing $400 million on some days, reflecting strong investor interest and confidence in BlackRock’s BTC strategy. This underscored BlackRock’s strategic approach to Bitcoin amid its growing adoption. Seeing this the crypto community has responded with optimism. Source: X As of the latest update, Bitcoin was trading at $67,773.35, marking a rise of over 1% within the past 24 hours as per CoinMarketCap. Additioanlly, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) was also lying above the neutral threshold, signaling that bullish momentum was overtaking bearish forces. Source: Trading View For Bitcoin’s roadmap ahead, an analysis by IntoTheBlock, cited by AMBCrypto, revealed that approximately 92.88% of BTC holders were “in the money,” meaning their holdings were valued higher than their initial purchase price. Meanwhile, only 2.45% of holders were “out of the money,” reflecting a robust market sentiment and suggesting potential for further price gains. Source: IntoTheBlock Speculation about future “Bitcoin wars” is already circulating, with some predicting that giants like BlackRock could eventually seek to fork the original Bitcoin chain and promote their own version as the legitimate one. While such a scenario may currently seem like a conspiracy theory, the rapid accumulation of BTC by BlackRock has raised concerns about its growing influence over the market. Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024–2025 However, they are not alone—other major players such as MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, as well as Tesla, Binance, and SpaceX, have also been steadily amassing Bitcoin. Therefore, whether MicroStrategy and other institutions will be able to challenge BlackRock’s dominance remains an open question.

Title: Bitcoin Headed to All-Time High – MicroStrategy Stock Hits $234 and $BTC ETFs Could Hit 1M

We maintain editorial independence and consider content quality and factual accuracy to be non-negotiable. Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy is once again in the news, this time with an ATH stock price of $234. Bitcoin ETFs are also nearing 1M $BTC as the last two weeks alone registered $3B inflows. This dual stunner news could be just what Bitcoin needs to shoot through its previous ATH of $73K. The coin recently passed $68K, and it doesn’t seem to be slowing down. MicroStrategy is the biggest corporate Bitcoin holder in the world. As of September 2024, the company owns 252,220 $BTC ($17B), and it keeps buying. According to Scott Melker (crypto investor and author), MicroStrategy ‘has also outperformed all companies in the S&P 500 over the past five years.’ Its stock ($MSTR) is currently $234, an 85.15% increase in the last year and a 271% year-to-date increase. In a recent shareholders proposal, MicroStrategy underlines that $MSTR has outperformed Microsoft stock by 313% this year. They attribute this achievement primarily to the large Bitcoin holding, similar to BlackRock, Microsoft’s second-largest shareholder. $MSTR’s next target is $245, according to Mark Palmer and other stock analysts. It’s far from an impossible task for a company with a 17.8% yield since adopting Bitcoin. US ETF issuers currently hold 976,892 $BTC (over $66.2B), almost 5% of Bitcoin’s total market cap. If it happens this week, we need to see $301M daily net inflows. This should be easy, as Bitcoin ETFs received $3B inflows in the past two weeks alone. Nate Geraci, co-founder of the ETF Institute, posted a chart of spot Bitcoin ETFs since inception. And the increase in holdings speaks for itself. From a zero-dollar industry in January 2024, $BTC ETFs pushed past 600K $BTC in February, nearing 1M $BTC today. Remember, it hasn’t even been a year since $BTC ETFs appeared. And we’re already talking about nearly $67B in total holdings. If we also consider the excellent timing (Russia lifting the Bitcoin mining ban, the Fed potentially cutting interest rates again, and the upcoming US elections), a Bitcoin bull rush might be coming. We know the Bitcoin halving typically leads to a price surge after several months. But we’ve rarely had such great tailwinds accompanying a halving before. Hendrik Andersson (Apollo Capital’s chief investment officer) said a Donald Trump victory would be the ‘biggest deciding factor’ of a crypto market rally. Bitcoin is currently $68.1K, a 1.64% increase in the last 24 hours. Its 24-hour volume also pumped by 41.62%, reaching $21.55B. It’s not every day we say this, but Bitcoin might have one of the best periods in its history. Many puzzle pieces need to fall in place, but the foundation is there. MicroStrategy’s stock price reaching an ATH, $BTC ETFs nearing 1M $BTC, and all the November action should be reasons enough for an epic pump, perhaps one to $172K.

Title: How a Trump or Harris presidency could impact your investments
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/market-impact-presidential-election-scenarios-trump-harris-stocks-bonds-crypto-2024-10
Time Published: 2024-10-28T09:00:01Z
Full Content:
With the presidential election just over a week away, and the candidates in a dead heat in the polls, Americans are in suspense about how their lives will change under a new leader. Business Insider has prepared a five-part refresher amid the final stretch to unpack the impacts that either a Donald Trump or a Kamala Harris presidency could have on US consumers. This first installment is focused on the investment landscape. Trump and Harris have each outlined policy proposals that would affect different parts of the stock market. The platform of whoever wins will also be crucial in determining the path of interest rates, which shape the bond market. But they're not expected to have diametrically opposed impacts on everything, with both candidates seen as positive forces for crypto. Detailed below is the latest research and commentary from top Wall Street strategists outlining how the market and investing landscape could shift under a Trump or a Harris administration. The guide covers four asset classes and is divided between the impact Trump or Harris could have on each. For equities, it's helpful to look at how both the micro (specific sectors set to be affected) and the macro (how the broader market will respond) could be influenced. Much of the industry guidance for the stock market under Trump boils down to his proposed tax policies. Bank of America estimates his plan to cut the corporate tax rate to 15% from 21% would boost corporate earnings by 4%. How much it would influence each sector would ultimately depend on sensitivity to changes in the tax rate. To that end, BofA says the consumer-discretionary and communication-services sectors — the areas most sensitive to tax-rate changes — would benefit the most. On the flip side, less exposed areas, such as utilities, real estate, and energy, would get the smallest boost. For energy, specifically, Trump's pro-drilling stance — while supportive of industry activity — would likely lead to oversupply and lower oil prices, BNY Wealth says. That, in turn, would hurt corporate profitability in the sector and drag on stock prices. It's also worth noting that energy was the worst-performing sector during Trump's administration. Another area of the stock market seen as benefiting from a Trump win is financials. Allies of the former president have said he aims to unburden banks from many of the regulations that were imposed following the 2008 financial crisis, something that his first administration tried to do, with limited success. Those looser regulations could also ignite a fresh wave of mergers and acquisitions, which would increase advisory revenue for big banks and help drive up profits from dealmaking. Views on the full equity-market landscape are divided, particularly along partisan lines. Trump's proposed tax and regulatory policies are seen by his supporters as pro-business moves that would be good news for corporate profit growth and deal activity. But Trump critics say his proposal for universal tariffs and steeper levies on Chinese imports — as well as a crackdown on immigration — would be inflationary, which could hold back stock prices. The nonpartisan Tax Foundation says the tariff plan, in particular, could hurt profit margins and put pressure on consumer spending. Bank of America estimates that 60% tariffs on China and 10% on other countries would lower S&P 500 earnings per share by 3.1%. That would be a problem since earnings growth has long been the stock market's primary driver of gains. "The conventional wisdom is wrong: Trump is not going to substantially cut taxes once in office; he is going to raise taxes by jacking up tariffs. To the extent that this dampens economic activity, it is bad news for stocks," BCA Research's chief strategist, Peter Berezin, said. Just like with Trump, much of the guidance around the stock market under Harris involves her tax plan. Her proposal to hike the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21% would have an inverse effect on sectors. That means consumer discretionary and communication services — the top beneficiaries under Trump — would be hit the hardest under a Harris administration, BofA says. "Consumer discretionary stocks have underperformed the S&P 500 modestly since Harris' presidential candidacy was announced, perhaps reflecting concerns that a Democratic President could result in higher corporate taxes and employee wages," BNY Wealth said. Financial firms could also feel a negative impact from both higher taxes and Harris' proposed regulatory tightening. But there are bright spots. A Harris victory would likely benefit homebuilder stocks because of her proposal to build 3 million houses. Renewable-energy stocks would also likely see gains because of Democrats' favorable views of wind and solar energy. Both sectors have outperformed in recent months during periods when Harris saw positive momentum in election polls. The stock market has soared to records during Joe Biden's presidency, up more than 50% since his inauguration, and a Harris win would likely continue many of the policies that have supported the market. Those include infrastructure investments and tax incentives to bring manufacturing jobs back to the country, such as in the semiconductor industry via the CHIPS and Science Act. But BofA says Harris' proposed tax hike would also put downward pressure on corporate profits, with an estimated 5% earnings hit. Beyond that, a quadrupling of the stock-buyback tax to 4% could also take 1% off S&P 500 profits, the firm said. With all these crosscurrents swirling, a neutral market outcome must also be assessed. Capital Economics says it believes neither a Trump nor Harris win will mean all that much for stock prices because bigger trends — specifically, artificial intelligence — will shape the market's direction. "Our upbeat projections for the stock market in 2024 and 2025 are predicated on a view that hype over AI will continue to fuel a stock market bubble," the research firm said. Capital Economics has a 2025 year-end target of 7,000 for the S&P 500, regardless of which candidate wins the election. Meanwhile, Bank of America says that as long as corporate profits continue to grow, the stock market will rise regardless of who wins the White House. The performance of the US bond market largely hinges on the direction of interest rates. As interest rates rise, bond prices generally fall, and vice versa. And since presidential actions usually influence rates, the bond market will likely be shaped by what either Trump or Harris ends up doing. A Trump win is seen as a scenario that would usher in higher interest rates, which would push bond prices lower. It ultimately boils down to inflation. Economists see Trump's double-whammy proposals of mass deportation and universal tariffs as inflationary. And since the Federal Reserve's primary tool for fighting inflation is raising interest rates, bond prices would suffer if yields rose. "Our assessment is that a Trump win would lead to higher US yields," Capital Economics said. Forecasts from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget — a nonprofit think tank — say a wider deficit and an increasing pile of debt under a Trump presidency, compared with a Harris presidency, would also put upward pressure on interest rates. That would also hurt the performance of bonds. Capital Economics says it expects interest rates to fall under a Harris win, which would be good news for bonds, as she likely wouldn't pursue certain inflationary policies like tariffs or immigrant deportations, which could fuel wage inflation. Harris' policies, considered to be less inflationary than Trump's, would also likely allow the Federal Reserve to continue cutting interest rates, which would boost bond prices. In a Bloomberg survey of institutional investors last month, 30% of respondents said they would add to their bond exposure if Harris won, while just 17% said they would buy more bonds if Trump won. Additionally, 46% of respondents said they would reduce their bond exposure if Trump won, compared with just 23% under a Harris win. A Trump win is seen as bullish for bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency industry, as Trump has firmly embraced digital assets in recent years. The Bernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani said bitcoin could hit $90,000 by December if Trump won the election, about 37% above its current level. "Elections remain hard to call, but if you are long crypto here, you are likely taking a Trump trade," Chhugani said. Harris has also embraced the crypto industry in recent months, though she's seen as slightly less bullish than Trump, given his public displays of support, including addressing crypto conferences and launching his own nonfungible tokens. Yet Wall Street seems to think that a big case for bitcoin will remain intact no matter who wins. The US government debt pile is expected to grow regardless of who controls the White House. That scenario is among bitcoin's biggest bull theses. "I'm not sure if either President or other candidate would make a difference. I do believe the utilization of digital assets is going to become more and more of a reality worldwide," BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said during his company's third-quarter earnings call. Trump's tax plan and protectionist trade policies are expected to strengthen the dollar. This is the opposite of what the presidential hopeful has said he wants since a weaker currency makes a nation's exports more competitive in global trade. These policies are expected to be inflationary, which would push interest rates higher and could prompt the Fed to tighten. Those climbing rates would then underpin dollar gains. If Trump retakes the White House, "the dollar would probably rally sharply, at least in the near term, on expectations of higher US tariffs and interest rates," Capital Economics said in a recent research note. A Harris presidency would continue the trends of a weaker dollar because of the "policy continuity" with the Biden administration, Capital Economics said. Since Harris' overall platform is less expansionary, it's expected to drive less inflationary pressure and therefore keep the coast clear for the Fed to cut rates and stimulate the economy as planned. That likelihood of lower interest would, in turn, push the dollar lower. Jump to

Title: If you need a reason to stay in bed this bank holiday, here’s what too little sleep is doing to you

In 1946, Randy Gardner participated in a Stanford University study to assess how long humans could go without sleep and whether there were any ill effects. After 11 days and 25 minutes, he finally fell asleep. Waking after a 14-hour nap, he claimed that staying awake for so long had no adverse effects. The researchers, however, thought otherwise, noting that he had suffered from short-term memory loss, paranoia and hallucinations. While it seems clear that depriving yourself of sleep for such an extended period could not be good for you, the question is, are we all depriving ourselves of much-needed sleep on a daily basis? While sleep needs vary, short sleep duration is defined as less than seven hours per night. On average, 35 per cent of adults sleep less than seven hours per night. Beyond feeling less than well-rested, the question is whether it has any other negative consequences. As a cardiologist interested in helping people prevent heart disease and live longer, my view on this is clear. Yes. While Randy Gardner was not trying for a Guinness world record for staying awake, attempts were banned in 1977 because of the inherent dangers. According to Netflix, sleep is its biggest competitor By comparison, though, there are still ongoing record attempts at holding live rattlesnakes in your mouth - it’s 13, in case you were wondering - and how many bees you can cover yourself in, a frightening 637,000. In the eyes of the Guinness World Records committee, these feats hold an “acceptable” risk of being reattempted compared to depriving yourself of sleep for long periods. That should tell you all you need to know. But what about the impacts of shortened sleep on health? Even four nights of shortened sleep can move people closer to becoming insulin resistant, the precursor state to diabetes. Shortened sleep is also linked to higher rates of high blood pressure, plaque build-up in the heart arteries, heart attacks and strokes. Your efforts at dieting can also be seriously thrown off by shortened sleep. People who have shortened sleep routinely eat 270 calories per day more on average. Even those who do manage to reduce their calorie intake are less likely to lose weight, and more of that weight is likely to be muscle and not fat. One of the biggest challenges of shortened sleep is its impact on mood and cognitive wellbeing. Recent evidence suggests that high levels of physical activity are linked to lower rates of dementia, except in those who are routinely sleep-deprived. So, for all of you exercising for the cognitive benefits, you might not be getting the gains you should be getting. The biggest challenge with getting more sleep is that the world incentivises you not to. According to Netflix, sleep is its biggest competitor. With endless competition for our attention, we all know the feeling of staying up that bit later because we want to watch just one more video or extra episode. What’s “just one more episode?” Well, studies of those who had the highest amounts of night-time light exposure show a 20 to 30 per cent increased odds of dying prematurely compared to those with much less night-time light exposure. Most people don’t even realise that they are currently part of the world’s biggest experiment on sleep, and here, I’m not talking about smartphones. Twice a year, the clocks change by one hour, either giving us one additional hour of sleep or taking one away. When we lose one hour of sleep, the rates of heart attacks increase by 24 per cent. When we gain it back, they come back down, but only by 21 per cent. There is even some evidence to suggest that rates of suicide increase and that judges give harsher sentences when daylight savings changes result in an hour less sleep. So even if your phone doesn’t steal your sleep, daylight savings time just might. Some people need very little sleep because they carry certain genes that limit their need for sleep, but these gene defects are rare. Others will claim that some of the greatest figures in history got by on very little sleep: Winston Churchill, Bill Clinton and Margaret Thatcher, to name a few. My response to this claim is simple: Bill Clinton had a triple bypass at age 58, Margaret Thatcher developed dementia in her early 70s, and Winston Churchill had his first of eight strokes in his mid-70s. I’m not saying sleep was the only factor here, but you will need to get some better examples if you are going to try to convince me. To get more sleep, you simply need to stick to the fundamentals. You probably don’t need supplements, and I strongly advise against sleeping tablets. Most people need to go to bed and get up at exactly the same time every single day – yes, that includes weekends. This will train your circadian rhythm to work with you and not against you. Changing time zones interrupts your circadian rhythm, but so does staying up two hours later, which is why we call it social jet lag. Charging your phone in another room, investing in blackout blinds, and keeping your room cool will all help you get a good night’s sleep. These simple changes have the biggest impact on sleep. Do I think that a few nights of shortened sleep will damage your health? No. Do I think a few decades will? Yes. You don’t need to set any world records; you just need about seven to nine hours most nights.

Title: Wall Street, Tech Royalty Head To Saudi Crown Prince's Event Amid War

Saudi Arabia will host the biggest names in finance and technology this coming week in a test of investor appetite for the kingdom's ambitions of transforming itself into a global hub at a time of widening regional conflict. International executives will have to contend with a region rocked by geopolitical tensions, with the threat of further military confrontation between Israel and Iran at the highest levels in decades. And they will land in a country that is increasingly facing up to the fact that even its vast oil wealth has limits. But those arriving at the Future Investment Initiative - often dubbed Davos in the desert - seem undeterred, sensing an opportunity to plug into Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's trillion-dollar Vision 2030 economic remake. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s David Solomon, Citigroup Inc.'s Jane Fraser and BlackRock Inc.'s Larry Fink have become regulars at the Riyadh summit and are set to return this year. Reflecting Saudi Arabia's focus on technology and artificial intelligence, they'll be joined by prominent names in those industries. Alphabet Inc. President Ruth Porat and TikTok Inc. Chief Executive Officer Shou Chew are set to speak at the summit for the first time. Benjamin Horowitz, tech entrepreneur and co-founder of venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz, is also making an appearance. Wall Street and Silicon Valley have increasingly turned to the oil-rich Middle East as liquidity gets tighter in other parts of the world, especially China. Saudi Arabia itself commands nearly $1 trillion in sovereign wealth, though the Crown Prince wants titans of industry to stop deploying that money overseas and instead help support his domestic ambitions. Yet the backdrop is one of increasing uncertainty. Saudi foreign policy has recently focused on lowering regional tensions in the hope that a more stable region will bring in foreign capital and technological know-how. But events of the past year have served as a reminder of how unstable the region can be. "The impact of regional instability on the prospects for foreign investment is completely negative, with the possible exception of the defense industry," said Gregory Gause, Professor of International Affairs at Texas A&M University. Capital is "not attracted to conflict regions, even if the country is not an immediate participant in the conflict." To be sure, Saudi Arabia is still pushing ahead with its big development plans. Deals worth more than $28 billion are likely to be announced over the next week by executives from around the world, according to Richard Attias, CEO of the FII Institute. Some of these will focus on AI, including potentially a new fund with Andreessen Horowitz that could grow to as large as $40 billion. The kingdom is also expected to announce a new company that will invest at least $10 billion in making Saudi Arabia a top global producer of hydrogen - a low carbon fuel that could be key to the world's transition away from burning fossil fuels. Ahead of the event, General Atlantic said it's opening its first office in the Middle East - in Saudi Arabia - to scout for more deals in the region. Two exchange-traded funds will make their trading debuts in Riyadh, giving Saudi investors access to Hong Kong stocks - a reflection of the kingdom's growing ties with China as it looks to boost investment flows with its biggest trading partner. Hong Kong Financial Secretary Paul Chan, and the Commissioner for the Belt and Road, Nicholas Ho, will speak at FII as some of the highest profile speakers from Asia. Still, the regional conflict is undoubtedly weighing on global investor sentiment in the Middle East. Saudi Arabia, the biggest Gulf economy, is feeling some of that. The number of actively-managed emerging market funds with Saudi exposure had been rising sharply until earlier this year, but stalled at around 56% as tensions between Israel and Iran escalated, according to Copley Fund Research. The data show that the number of funds invested in the Saudi stock market fell slightly between March and September this year and that the country is the third-biggest underweight after Taiwan and India. Coupled with that, Crown Prince Mohammed has had to come to terms with the limits of even Saudi Arabia's vast financial resources to pay for his ambitions. The government, which is forecasting deficits out to at least 2027, has said some projects will be need to be delayed. At the same time, the Public Investment Fund, the kingdom's powerful sovereign fund that the de-facto ruler chairs, is becoming a tougher place for foreign firms to get money out of. An increased focus on domestic projects like the $1.5 trillion Neom has global asset managers fretting that the PIF will have less cash to spend abroad. "The FII has always been designed as a mechanism for investment into Saudi, however in reality it has been an opportunity for foreign execs to extract financing from the Kingdom," said Zaid Belbagi, managing partner of political risk consultancy Hardcastle Advisory. "Sold-out hotels at $500-1000 per night are indicative of sustained international interest." The organizers of the Riyadh jamboree remain confident, and about 7,000 people have registered to attend this year's event. That's higher than the numbers for last year's summit, which took place days after the current conflict in the region started. When asked what attendees were speaking about ahead of the event, FII Institute's Attias said the US election was front of mind. There are many executives that feel developments in the Middle East hinge on the outcome of the vote, he said on a Bloomberg television interview on Monday. Even so, investors are coming "despite what is happening in the world," Attias said. "The show must go on."

Title: Asset managers roll out new ETFs to tap in to AI buzz

By Suzanne McGee (Reuters) - Exchange-traded funds focused on artificial intelligence are proliferating as asset managers offer investors new ways to tap in to the market enthusiasm for AI, even while it remains unclear which companies will emerge as the long-term winners from the latest technology revolution. More than one-third of the two dozen ETFs that include artificial intelligence or AI in their name have been launched in 2024 alone, according to data from Morningstar. In the past week, three more joined their ranks, including a cloud computing ETF rebranded and revamped to specifically target AI. The AI ETF group now has assets of $4.5 billion, drawing it closer to the $5.5 billion nuclear power-themed ETF universe, and pushing it well above the cannabis sector, with $1.37 billion in assets. "I'm not surprised their ranks are multiplying," said Daniel Sotiroff, senior analyst at Morningstar. "This is a fast-growing, fast-moving industry, and it is easy to hope that you could end up making a lot of money in a short period of time." The 200%-plus stock gain by chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) - AI's poster child - over the last 12 months likely just reaffirms that confidence, Sotiroff said. Beyond Nvidia, AI is likely to produce a larger and broader swath of beneficiaries in the future, said Tony Kim, head of the fundamental equities technology group at BlackRock (NYSE:BLK). Kim is the manager of the two new AI-themed ETFs launched by BlackRock on Tuesday, the iShares A.I. Innovation and Tech Active ETF and the iShares Technology Opportunities Active ETF. The first of the firm's AI products, the $630 million iShares Future AI & Tech ETF, launched in 2018, currently trades just below a 52-week high recorded on Oct. 14. While its initial AI product is linked to an index, the two new funds are actively managed and designed to capture emerging opportunities within AI, according to Jay Jacobs, head of active and thematic ETFs at BlackRock. "The AI market is going to change dramatically," said Kim. "What you think it is today, isn’t going to be what it becomes tomorrow or next year or in a few years." ARMS RACE BofA Securities market analysts Ohsung Kwon and Savita Subramanian said in a recent report they believe there is "an AI arms race" under way among giant technology companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). They calculate that capital spending this year from four megacaps making big AI bets will total $206 billion, up 40% over 2023. Meanwhile, capital spending by the other 496 companies in the S&P 500 will dip slightly, they project. Venture capital firms also are directing as much as $79.2 billion in funding to AI startups by the end of the year, 27% above 2023 levels, according to an estimate from venture firm Accel. That means that 40 cents of every dollar invested by VC firms will go to an AI company. Of course, investing in an AI-themed ETF does not guarantee market outperformance. The largest of the AI funds, the Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF, is up about 20% so far this year, against a 22% rise for the benchmark S&P 500. Amplify ETFs earlier this month rebranded an existing cloud-computing ETF to reflect a new focus on the emerging technology, naming it the Amplify Bloomberg AI Value Chain ETF. "Now, we're trying to get exposure to the cloud with a specific AI tilt," said Nathan Miller, vice president of product development at Amplify. The long-term goal, he added, is to be ready to profit if and when all that capital spending on AI starts to show up in earnings, and be ahead of the curve in identifying new opportunities. "Like every ETF firm out there, we are trying to offer investors something differentiated," Miller said.

MicroStrategy MSTR executive chairman Michael Saylor humorously reached out to Microsoft MSFT CEO Satya Nadella, suggesting he can help with the company’s Bitcoin BTC/USD strategy. What Happened: In a post on X on Friday, Saylor advised Nadella that if he's interested in creating the next trillion-dollar opportunity, he should reach out. This comes as Microsoft, per an SEC filing, prepares to discuss a possible Bitcoin investment at its December shareholder meeting. MicroStrategy, despite being much smaller, has outperformed Microsoft by 313% largely due to its Bitcoin holdings. The company’s total bitcoin holdings as of Oct. 20 stand at 252,220, worth $9.91 billion. Microsoft's second-largest shareholder, BlackRock BLK, has already shown confidence in Bitcoin, offering its clients a Bitcoin ETF. Also Read: If you invested $100 in DOGE when Elon Musk first tweeted about it in 2019, here’s how much you’d have today. Why It Matters: Saylor's message highlights MicroStrategy's strong performance amid its heavy Bitcoin investments, with the company's stock up 444% over the past year, including a 244% YTD increase. Investor confidence in MicroStrategy recently grew as BlackRock raised its stake in the company to 5.2%, making MicroStrategy a key entry point for institutional Bitcoin exposure. What’s Next: The influence of Bitcoin as an institutional asset class is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.

Pre listing, we had recommended profit booking if Waaree lists at double of its issue price which was the street expectations. With listing at Rs 2550, we believe the stock can deliver healthy returns post listing as well. We believe the long term investor demand would continue at the counter on the back of sector demand and expansion plans, with an opportunity to play at the largest manufacturer of solar PV modules in India, bolstered by favourable government policies and few incentive (PLI) schemes. Hence, we recommend long term investors to “HOLD” while short term investors can look for a target anywhere between Rs 2750-2800 to book profits. Fresh accumulation can be attempted anywhere between Rs 2200-2300 if the opportunity arises due to market scenario and profits booking attempts. Waaree Energies stock declined 4.88% on the NSE to trade at ₹2,378 as at 1.05 pm. Waaree Energies stock traded at ₹2,427.80 on the NSE, lower by 2.89% as at 12.07 pm.

Overall, Waaree Energies Limited made a strong listing of 2509, reflecting investor confidence in the company’s growth potential and financial stability.

The stock climbed to as high as 2,624.40 rupees in early trading Monday, from its issue price of 1,503 rupees. Mumbai-based Waaree had seen strong interest for its deal, with the issue getting subscribed by more 70 times. The debut comes on the back of a world-beating rally in India’s renewable-energy stocks this year. The firm’s gain stands in contrast to Hyundai Motor India’s IPO that culminated in a first-day decline last week. The $3.3 billion IPO, the nation’s largest ever, drew poor interest from retail investors — a break from the frenzy seen in some recent IPOs, particularly smaller issues. Waaree’s retail portion of the IPO was subscribed nearly 11 times, according to exchange data, underscoring the appetite for new listings in India remains strong. The appeal of India’s renewable sector, where stocks have rallied this year, is also drawing investors. Waaree sells products such as solar modules and inverters. It posted a profit of more than 4 billion rupees ($47.7 million) on revenue from operations of 34.1 billion rupees for the three months ended June, according to its red-herring prospectus. Its shares attracted investments from prominent Wall Street names, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc., BlackRock Inc., and Morgan Stanley. The company’s business prospects align with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s goal to boost renewable-energy production by more than twofold from current levels. The sector may need investments of $2.2 trillion by 2050, according to Bloomberg Intelligence estimates. Indian IPOs have raised $13.1 billion so far this year, more than the annual volumes in the past two years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Listings in the nation this year have on average generated a nearly 27% first-day gain. Among IPOs between $500 million and $1 billion, the gain was about 66%.

Title: Broadcom (AVGO): Leading with Custom Silicon and Strategic Acquisitions
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/broadcom-avgo-leading-custom-silicon-033349045.html
Time Published: 2024-10-28T03:33:49Z
Full Content:
We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best-Performing S&P 500 Stocks in the Last 3 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other best performing S&P 500 stocks in the last year. The past three years have been a bit of a roller coaster ride for the stock market. We saw how the pandemic wrecked several industries’ balance sheets and supply chains. Following the global vaccination drive, economies around the world and in the US opened up with a vengeance, resulting in huge stimulus checks. This, along with the energy and food-price shock and disrupted supply chains, was blamed for the persistently high inflation, which peaked at 9.1% in June 2022. The Fed had already started hiking interest rates to ease inflation and work towards a soft landing, with the first hike coming in March 2022. By July 2023, the central bank had raised it to 5.25-5.50%, making borrowing all the more challenging. The tech industry had kept the momentum from 2020 lockdowns well into 2021. The largest tech companies out of the 500 biggest companies trading in the US grew by an average of 33% from the start of 2021 to the end. However, the tech industry was heavily impacted by the rate hikes that followed in 2022. This resulted in the large-cap aggregate tech indices losing nearly 29% of the gains made in the year prior, as prospects for growth became bleak. The upper percentiles of the energy industry in market cap had a similar run in 2021 but remained immune to the economic downturn that followed in 2022, posting gains of 59% for the year. The aggressive rally in the energy industry resulted from a combination of supply-chain disruptions, OPEC production cuts, the Russia-Ukraine war, and the revision of energy sourcing in Europe, directing much of the energy capital inflow to the US from the continent. Coming back to tech – the industry wouldn’t stay on the sidelines for long. The start of 2023 to the end saw the large-cap US-traded tech equity grow by 38.6%. At the core of the resurgence was the AI-led boom combined with semiconductor supply chains that had recovered substantially by then. Other factors included CHIPS and Science Act, improved efficiency in the industry, and a rate-hike slowdown. The US economy looks to be on schedule for a soft landing, according to a Financial Times’ survey of economists. This is on the back of the Fed’s rate reduction of 50 basis points in September 2024, which, as noted by the CFO of a large US bank Denis Colman, is a signal towards a soft landing. This is not a sure shot, however, since some experts remain wary and continue worrying about a recession. For instance, Piper Sandler’s Chief Global Economist Nancy Lazar noted that the “jumbo” rate cut by the Fed is reminiscent of the similar Fed policy easing of 2001 and 2007, which couldn’t avert the problem. However, according to analysts, the case for a soft landing appears to be justified given the September jobs report and other improving indicators. The September report by BLS shows that the non-farm payrolls grew by 254,000 for the month, exceeding economists’ estimates by 41%. Moreover, the July and August reports, which had spooked some economists, were also revised by a combined 72,000 new hires, which wasn’t without historical precedent. Further, grocery prices, adjusted for growth in real wages, are back to the pre-pandemic levels. It took 3.59 hours of work to afford a week’s worth of groceries in November 2019 and took 3.57 hours of work to afford them in September 2024. Moving ahead, Rob Rowe, Regional Research Director and Head of Global Strategy at a large US bank is ‘tactically bullish’ on the back of continuing tech recovery and the markets “pricing in a soft landing”. They expect at-least 25 basis-point rate cuts at each Fed meeting through year-end. With regards to tech industry, their outlook suggests selectivity. In response to a question about their outlook on the tech industry, they said: “I think we have to be selective here. We like Semis as a recovery play but we’re kind of underweight on software.” Rowe has a bearish outlook on oil, given geopolitical variables don’t change in a way that leads to oil prices shooting up. For our list, we have picked stocks from the index in question that have had the highest 3-year annualized returns and we ranked them as such, in order of their 3-year CAGR. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit. 3Y CAGR: 55.87% Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) has been one of the most profitable stocks in the S&P500 index over the past few years. The company has been very successful in its patent portfolio strategy by acquiring other tech companies by leveraged buyouts. Some of its recent acquisitions include CA Technologies and VMware, with VMware being especially prominent. Further, Broadcom is the biggest player in the custom silicon market that lets other companies design their own AI accelerators, which are increasingly opting for specific chips for specific use cases. Following is what Clearbridge Large Cap Value strategy had to say about AVGO in their Q3, 2024 investor letter: “In IT, we bought Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) as we believe the company has a long runway for growth with its custom silicon business, which should be more durable and less volatile than other components within the AI food chain. We also believe the acquisition of VMware creates another opportunity for steady, subscription-based durable growth that is still in its early innings. We believe the stock has an attractive risk/reward profile given the reasonable visibility toward mid-teens EPS growth at a low-20s P/E multiple. We made room for Broadcom by exiting Lam Research, whose shares we believed priced in a full recovery, while we grew increasingly concerned that China exposure might create an air pocket.” Overall, AVGO ranks 7th on our list of best performing S&P 500 stocks in the last year. While we acknowledge the potential of the best-performing S&P500 stocks in the Last 3 Years, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) stands against other best quantum computing stocks to buy according to analysts. The modern digital world is built with its transistor-based chips on the foundations of Quantum Mechanics, the physics governing the world at the fundamental level. However, the world has barely scratched the surface when it comes to the full potential of Quantum Mechanics, that is, until Quantum computing came to the foray. In the same spirit but in different light to its classical counterpart, quantum-computing technology seeks to exploit particle superpositions for computing operations. It differs from classical computing due to the particle superpositions that occur at the quantum scale, allowing a qubit to be in a state of both 0 and 1 until it interacts with the environment. This exploit would allow Quantum computers to outperform classical computers exponentially in certain computing tasks. This could have huge implications for healthcare, finance, telecom, and energy industries, among others, ushering the world in a new era of accelerated economic growth. Mckinsey estimates that an economic value of $0.9 – $2 trillion can be extracted by 2035 across four industries – chemicals, life sciences, finance and mobility – due to quantum computing. The McKinsey report estimates the Quantum computing market size to be between $45 billion to $131 billion by 2040. Precedence Research appears more conservative and probably more grounded (You’ll see why). According to their report, the market for quantum computing is around $1 billion as of this year and is projected to expand at a CAGR of 30.9% from 2024 to 2034, reaching a size of $16 billion by the end of the forecast period. The US is expected to comprise $7 billion of the projected quantum market pie by the end of 2034. The market in the US is expected to grow at a CAGR of 31.2% from 2024-2034. As of 2023, North America unsurprisingly comprises 61% of the quantum-computing market. As we point out in a similar article from May, analyzing the quantum-computing equity market based on an ETF exposed to it is a bit tricky. Very few companies have core business related to quantum computing and most companies in these ETFs have peripheral Quantum computing projects but are big and high-performing in other industries that are core to their business, so an ETF’s performance wouldn’t be saying much about the quantum computing industry. Therefore, we’ll delve a little deeper to see what actual challenges there are in the industry and whether they can be practically solved for the delivery of a return on investment as far as scalable practical use cases go. Solving Quantum computing is akin to a Herculean labor. It’s hard to argue with the laws of physics, and when it comes to Quantum computing, a major problem yet to be overcome is Decoherence-induced errors. Decoherence is the enabler of transition from Quantum physics to the everyday physics we experience. Qubits (the quantum equivalent of bits) can only remain in a superposition as long as there’s no interaction with the environment. Even the slightest interaction causes them to decohere to classical bits, introducing computing errors. The hard part is to keep them in a superposition long enough for quantum computation to be viable. Further, to scale quantum computing, you have to add more qubits to the system, but adding more qubits, in principle, increases the probability of error. Finally, any approaches to error correction must obey the Quantum no-cloning theorem, which makes these approaches inherently more challenging than their classical counterparts. In 2022, Azure Quantum demonstrated the soundness of physics required to build topological qubits (these qubits are different in that they can maintain coherence for longer and would thereby lead to a reduced error rate through more stability). On the other hand, Researchers at Quantum AI, an arm of another big tech company, made a breakthrough in 2023, demonstrating a reduced error rate even with an increased number of traditional Qubits. However, rare correlated error events that happened roughly every hour limited the exceptionally low error rate required for practical quantum computing, with more research required to tackle them. Despite these steps, the challenges remain to be effectively overcome. It’s anyone’s guess how long it’ll take for quantum computers to scale and become economically viable. If the amount of capital being invested by venture capital firms in the industry is any guide, it certainly doesn’t look good for the industry as of recent. According to IQM’s State-of-Quantum Report of 2024, the venture capital invested in Quantum startups dropped by 50% worldwide in 2023 compared to the year prior, with the US quantum startup ecosystem seeing the greatest decline of capital at 80%. As far as public equity in the quantum computing industry goes, it is overall yet to be profitable. The industry hasn’t experienced any operating leverage in any meaningful sense and is focused on growing revenue in its early stage. The hard problems with regards to practicality and scalability has resulted in many quantum computing stocks trade at price levels that make them non-compliant with stock exchanges, resulting in delisting threats by stock exchanges. Also read why Jim Cramer can’t recommend a particular quantum computing stock here. For our list, we’ve selected companies that have a presence in the quantum computing industry and ranked them on the basis of their 12-month price upside on analysts’ consensus. Please note that we have used the median upside because average upsides can be greatly affected by outlier analysts on either side of the low or high. For some stocks, both mean and median upsides were too low, but since we wanted to limit our list to pure-play stocks as much as we could, we chose them using the high end of the upside, provided that at least 9 analysts had contributed to their average upside. Finally, we ranked the stocks on weighted scores, with median upside having a weight of 0.4 while analyst count having a weight of 0.6. For stocks for which we have used high-end of the upside, the weight for the upside is 0.2, with analyst-count weight reduced to 0.4. For stocks whose upside is based on only one analyst, and if the upside is over 30%, we assigned weights of 0.01 to both the upside and the analyst count. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Median Upside Potential: 20.86% Number of Analysts: 25 Insider Monkey Weighted Score: 23.3 Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) has had a bad run in the past few years due to bad management decisions, failure to advance in chip fabrication, and decreased market share due to ARM-based chips. It’s down 53% year-to-date and 60% on a 5-year annualized basis. We have included Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) solely because of the potential of its quantum technology and low competition in this market compared to Intel’s other markets. Intel’s silicon spin qubit approach rather than superconducting qubits has the promise to reduce the complexity associated with quantum hardware since spin qubits can operate at higher temperatures. Spin qubits are also smaller than superconducting qubits, allowing for more complex versions of quantum computers in principle on a chip of the same size. In a paper published by Intel researchers in Nature in May 2024, researchers found that Intel’s approach results in 99.9% gate fidelity, an important milestone. Intel is well-positioned owing to its transistor-manufacturing credentials to create spin qubits through its 300mm CMOS manufacturing techniques. Overall, INTC ranks 6th on our list of best quantum computing stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of INTC as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than INTC but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Despite the ongoing subdued market mood, Waaree Energies received the strongest subscription response from all sets of investors and also debuted slightly below our expectations. Pre listing, we had recommended profit booking if Waaree lists at double of its issue price which was the street expectations. With listing at Rs 2550, we believe the stock can deliver healthy returns post listing as well. We believe the long term investor demand would continue at the counter on the back of sector demand and expansion plans, with an opportunity to play at the largest manufacturer of solar PV modules in India, bolstered by favourable government policies and few incentive (PLI) schemes. Hence, we recommend long term investors to “HOLD” while short term investors can look for a target anywhere between Rs 2750-2800 to book profits. Fresh accumulation can be attempted anywhere between Rs 2200-2300 if the opportunity arises due to market scenario and profits booking attempts.

That said, the tactical trend remains down and any bounce on the Nifty will face stiff resistance in the 24,413 - 24,462 area, while support lies at 24,073. Any break below this support will bring the all-important 23,779 into the picture.

Other Asian markets were mostly in the green on Monday morning. Nifty ended on a weak note on October 25 near two and half month lows despite the last hour bounce. It fell for the fifth consecutive session. It closed lower for the fourth consecutive week falling 2.71% over the week. Indian markets have fallen on all days of the week reeling under FPI selling pressure, weak Q2 results from most corporates and rising treasury yields in the US. Though a bounce in the markets is overdue, it needs reversal of selling pressure from FPIs and some sentiment stability in the local investor community. Nifty could now take support from 23892 while 24378 could prove to be tough to breach on the up in the near term. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services. “A significant market trend during the recent days of market correction is the flight to quality. While the Nifty corrected by 8.3% from the recent peak, the mid and small cap indices corrected by 9.8% and 9.3% respectively from their recent peaks. Actually the index movements conceal the carnage in the mid and smallcaps where the correction has been above 30% in dozens of stocks and even by more than 40% in some momentum stocks. It is important to know that many largecaps are steady in this volatile market. The trend of flight to quality is likely to sustain given the good numbers from banking majors like HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank where valuations continue to be fair. Investors can profit from these polarised valuations. The global market structure may turn favourable after the subdued Israeli strikes against Iran avoiding the Iranian oil fields which has resulted in a sharp drop in crude prices. The imminent US presidential elections and the uncertainty associated with that will continue to weigh on markets.” Anand James, Chief Market Strategist, Geojit Financial Services. Nifty outlook: With Friday’s closing hour managing to push Nifty above the initial two hour’s close when the selling intensity was at its highest, we now have initial signs of a reversal. The August low of 23894 will thus act as a downside marker for all upside attempts. However, we also expect rejection trades to resurface on pull back to 24350. Derivative outlook: Nifty weekly contract has highest open interest at 25000 for Calls and 23000 for Puts while monthly contracts have highest open interest at 25000 for Calls and 23000 for Puts.

Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) have sold ₹1,02,931 crore in October, impacting market momentum. The dollar index rallied for the fourth consecutive week and is keeping intact the overall uptrend. The index has risen breaking above the resistance at 104. It closed the week at 104.25, up 0.74 per cent. A strong rise in the US Treasury yields is aiding the greenback to retain its strength. Markets turning slightly cautious ahead of the US Presidential Election next month is also giving the dollar a safe-haven support. The uptrend is strong, and we expect the rally in the dollar to continue for another couple of weeks until the outcome of the US elections is known. Sudarshan Chemical (SCIL) announced a large acquisition of Germany-based Heubach Group at a highly discounted valuation on October 11. The speciality chemicals player manufactures colour pigments and is the largest domestic player. While the leap the company has made is commendable and at the opportune moment, investors may hold the stock till further details emerge. The roadmap in turning around the acquisition, part of which turned insolvent, and incremental growth from the acquisition need to be articulated by the company before investing in the stock. The stock trading at 28 times one-year forward earnings also captures the deal enthusiasm and the company prospects in the long term.

However, in the last one year, they have attempted a strong recovery piggy-backing on the AI theme, and Nifty IT is now 6.5 per cent above the 2022 peak. It is not clear though if this will sustain. While recent Q2 results indicate the slowdown may have bottomed out, the pace of revenue growth still remains underwhelming.

According to deep discount broker, SAS Online’s breadth analysis, Only 15 per cent of NSE stocks are trading above their 50-day moving average, and just 9 per cent are above their 20-day moving average, suggesting a possible relief but overall, a strong bearish grip. The brokerage said the number of stocks with RSI in the bullish zone has dropped to 20%, indicating exhaustion in upward momentum. Additionally, the Bull Bear Index of trend indicators like MACD also points to muted breadth, it further said.

BlackRock and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) will invest in the $1.4 billion IPO, which will be the country’s second-biggest stock offering this year, the sources told Reuters. Here’s an interesting stock idea: The stock idea that we have for you today is Thermax. The stock has surged about 5 per cent on Friday breaking above key resistance on Friday. The price action indicates that a fresh leg of upmove has begun. The outlook is bullish and the share price can go up in the coming days. Check out the latest episode of bl.Today’s Pick to learn more. Last week we said that #Nifty can bounce back from its support around 24,400. But that view has gone wrong. The fall last week confirms a head and shoulder pattern on the chart. That leaves the danger of seeing more fall in the short-term. A short-lived recovery is also possible before another leg of fall happens. However, from a big picture there are good chances that we could be in the last leg of this correction. So, we expect the broader uptrend to resume after one more leg of fall from here. #Nifty can fall to 23,500-23,000 on a break below 23,900. After this fall, the overall uptrend can resume. #NiftyBank index can fall to 49,700-49,400 and then rise back to 51,000-52,000 again.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs Reach $3 Billion Inflows In October, Retail Investors Lead The Charge – Report

Bitcoin ETFs ended last week on another positive note with $997.70 million in net inflows and demand reaching its highest level in six months. Undoubtedly, these ETFs have marked the turning point for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies since the beginning of the year, as it opened up the cryptocurrency to inflows from every side. Interestingly, data has shown that retail investors are responsible for most of the demand for Spot Bitcoin ETFs, accounting for 80% of the total assets under management. According to Bloomberg data, Bitcoin ETFs have dominated the ETF landscape in 2024, claiming the top four positions for inflows among all ETFs launched this year. Specifically, out of the 575 ETFs introduced thus far, 14 of the top 30 are new funds focusing on Bitcoin or Ethereum. The standout performer is the BlackRock IBIT fund, which has attracted over $23 billion in year-to-date inflows. Last week was another example of the positive performance in Spot Bitcoin ETFs, despite the coin’s consolidation below the $68,000 price level. According to flow data from SosoValue, weekly inflows started on a positive note on Monday, October 21, with $294.29 million entering the funds and ended the week with $402.08 million in inflows on Friday, October 25. Interestingly, Spot Bitcoin ETFs now hold about 938,700 BTC in 10 months since launch and are steadily approaching the 1 million BTC mark. Although these ETFs have opened doors for institutional investors, a recent report from crypto exchange Binance indicates that retail investors are the primary drivers of this surge in demand, accounting for 80% of the holdings in Spot BTC ETFs. Originally intended to provide institutional investors access to BTC, Spot Bitcoin ETFs have now become the preferred choice for many individual investors looking to take advantage of the regulatory clarity they offer. Nonetheless, there has been a steady demand from the institutional side, with institutional holdings rising by 30% since Q1. Among institutional investors, investment advisers have emerged as the fastest-growing party, with their holdings increasing by 44.2% to reach 71,800 BTC this quarter. Thanks to the rapid growth of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, an impressive 1,179 institutions, including financial giants such as Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, have joined the crypto’s cap table in less than a year. For comparison, Gold ETFs were only able to attract 95 institutions in their first year of trading. This upward trajectory of institutional investments in Bitcoin is poised to continue into the foreseeable future, which bodes well for the overall price outlook of Bitcoin. As these ETFs attract more institutional capital, they are likely to produce second-order effects like increased BTC dominance, improved market efficiency, and reduced volatility that could significantly benefit the cryptocurrency ecosystem. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $67,100.

Clontarf returned to winning ways by travelling to Cork and avenging last season’s epic semi-final defeat with a 20-16 win over the champions Constitution. Con led 13-6 at the break thanks to a try by Irish Sevens winger Sean French, but Clontarf stormed back in the second half through tries by centre Tadhg Bird and Leinster academy winger Aitzol Arenzana-King. Shock of the day was at Lakelands Park where City of Armagh secured a last gasp 30-26 win. Terenure had not lost at home in over a year and had beaten each of the other “big four”. But Armagh roared into a 23-5 interval lead, Kyle Faloon kicking three penalties and converting Dylan Nelson’s try in addition to a penalty try. Terenure responded with three converted tries by Craig Adams (his second), Harrison Brewer and Henry McErlean, but Armagh went to the corner for hooker Jonny Morton to burrow over. Ballynahinch moved into second with a 33-7 win at home to Garryowen, securing a bonus point by half time before a second try by another ex-Irish Sevens winger Zac Ward. St Mary’s also secured a bonus pint by half time in UCD through tries by Leandro Ramirez, Dan Goggin and Jack Nelson (two) en route to a 29-21 win which moved them above Terenure ahead of the sides’ first derby in seven seasons at Templeville Road a fortnight hence. Young Munster also had a bonus point by the interval through tries by Manuel Covella, Jake O’Riordan, Christian Foley and Hubert Gilvarry, and another by Stephen McLoughlin, converted by Argentinian Julian Leszczynski, had them 36-7 ahead before a late rally by Lansdowne. In the 2B summit meeting at Corinthian Park the young home side led 14-0 through tries by Orin Burke and John Devine, the second created by Sean Naughton’s break and offload, but Instonians led at half time through unconverted tries by Bradley McNamara, Ian Whitten and Schalk van der Merwe, two conversions hitting the upright. After a red card for the 37-year-old Whitten, eldest of four Instonians’ siblings, Corinthians’ late siege led to centre Tom Waters crashing over for a 21-15 win. It was just a third defeat in 41 games for “Inst”, and the second in that run by Corinthians. In 2B neighbours Galwegians lost 26-24 in Malone, a fifth defeat by two points or one, leaving them winless with six bonus points and a points difference of minus seven.

Title: BlackRock Makes History With 400,000 Bitcoin (BTC)

U.Today - BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) has reached a new milestone in its Bitcoin holdings, with a total of over 400,000 BTC. Right now, the hedge fund's holdings are valued at around $26.98 billion, with a total of 403,725 BTC. This big accumulation comes as the asset management giant bought another 34,085 BTC over the past two weeks, which is estimated to be worth about $2.3 billion, reports Lookonchain. The ongoing inflows into Bitcoin ETFs are helping BlackRock to grow its presence in the cryptocurrency market, making the firm a dominant force. This shows that more and more, Bitcoin ETFs are becoming a big way for institutions to own BTC. As the company increases its holdings, some people think that Bitcoin's future might change. Many are already projecting a sort of Bitcoin wars in the future, making dystopian predictions that BlackRock will eventually push for the fork of the original BTC chain and then promote its own forked chain as the real one, using all its massive resources to do so. It does not sound like something impossible, but in the current realm it seems more like a conspiracy theory. Such a rapid accumulation of Bitcoin has people wondering where BlackRock will draw the line in its pursuit of dominance in the cryptocurrency market. On the other hand, the financial behemoth faces challenges to its influence from other significant stakeholders in the Bitcoin space, including figures like Michael Saylor with MicroStrategy's Bitcoin holdings, mining entities, early adopters and millions of individual investors who form a large and decentralized market presence. Whether they will be able to present a solid opposition to BlackRock is another question however. This article was originally published on U.Today

Title: Zelensky the Lying War Criminal Tries to Create World War III

Skip to comments. Posted on 10/27/2024 9:30:39 AM PDT by delta7 world into World War III. He actually suggested he be given nuclear weapons if not allowed to join NATO. I have had employees both in Kyiv and Donetsk, and the sad part about this is they have lost their country, and for what? I warned them that he was dishonest and had been constantly lying and trying to manipulate the world. He intentionally dresses as if he is in the military, no matter what he attends. He thinks this is a psychological ploy to get him never-ending money constantly. The only way to world peace is to arrest this clown, and he should be in prison for the rest of his life without parole. Zelensky lied to get into office and pretended to be Christian, even baptizing g his two children. He promised peace to win, and my sources in Kiev swear the election was rigged. He promised peace, and has done everything put what he promised and then declared Martial Law so he does not have to stand for election every again as long as he can keep this war going. Heis VICTORY PLAN was nothing but to conquer and destroy Russia. He then suddenly became Jewish to select the fact that he was a Neo-Nazi and used to joke on stage about confiscating assets from Jews and Russians which he classified as the same. Friends in Israel do not consider him Jewish and he was pushing his claimed Jewish heritage and then asking for money implying this was vaguely connected to exterminating the Jews. The Pandora Papers revealed that Zelensky also had secret hidden offshore accounts along with all the other corrupt Ukrainian politicians. He had the audacity to claim that they were offshore protecting him against pro-Russian forces. In truth, these offshore accounts pre-dated him becoming president. Sources in Ukraine also claim that he was drafted and never showed up for military service. warned that if Zelensky were assassinated, he would be by a Ukrainian. He has destroyed his own country hoping to make a fortune on its reconstruction. Farmland is now bought by Blackrock, and the list of corruption is endless. Zelensky is looking for hundreds of billions to rebuild Ukraine and has the audacity to claim this will be the biggest investment project for Europe in modern history. The day before Russia came to the aid of the Donbas in this civil war that Kiev started on the alleged orders of Victoria Nuland, to ensure Putin would cross the border, he declared that Ukraine would rearm with nuclear weapons. That was the final straw; Putin even noted that in his address to Russia. It was not any different than the JFK and the Cuban Missile Crisis. The Washington Post found out that Zelensky knew when Russia would cross the border and did not warn his people. Like Hamas, he wanted civilians to be killed so he could blame Russia. When asked why he did not warn his people, he said it would have cost him $7 billion dollars. That is a war criminal. It was the American Neocons who instructed the UNELECTED Kiev government to attack the Russians in the Donbas and call them terrorists because they, too, wanted to separate from the Ukrainians who hate Russians and were killing them on the streets of Odesa. Zelendky staged the entirely false claim that Russia just killed civilians in Bucha. I have seen footage of pretend bodies with no visible blood lying in the streets, and as the car passed, they got up. There was no evidence of any such massacre. You have to understand that creating false flags is the #1 occupation of Ukraine. On March 31, 2022, the mayor of Bucha was joyful in announcing that the settlement had been liberated. He does not talk about any corpses on the roads and the terrible destruction of mass graves. It was two days later when suddenly photos and videos of people lying along the road appeared and horrendous stories about hundreds of dead being thrown in mass graves. These reports did not surface until two days after the Russians left. The Ukrainians were staging another false flag. Why did the mayor appear joyous and make no mention at first of these atrocities? This is why the West simply claimed there was no evidence and hid this was yet another Ukrainian False Flag trying to start World War III. Any Western Politician who votes for anything to support Ukraine should be charged with treason. Zelensky tried to claim Russia attacked Poland to start World War III. The evidence shows it was Ukraine that attacked Poland and tried to claim it was Russia. My RELIABLE sources insisted that it was Ukrainians who shot down the Malaysia fight and tried to blame the Russians. That was all covered up, and they blamed Russians in the Donbas. The West simply wants to destroy Russia. This is why Merkel lied to Putin and falsely negotiated the Minsk Agreement to buy time for Ukraine to build an army. This has been on the agenda for decades, and the fall of communism never changed that policy. They will do the same with China. In truth, this is Ukrainians invading the Russian territory where Russians have lived for centuries. The propaganda has flipped this completely around, claiming Putin was invading Ukraine when they began this civil war in 2014 and launched the first attacks on the Donbas. The treatment of Polish, Jews, and Russians during WWII even horrified the German Nazis. Why would Poland ever support Ukraine can only be that its leaders are told what to say and do by those behind NATO seeking World War III. The Polish people should wake up, for they will be the next to be thrown on this altar of geopolitical sacrifice. The Polish Association of Memory of Victims of Crimes of Ukrainian Nationalists documented 135 methods of torture and murder practiced by Ukrainian Nazis. Poland officially called the Ukrainian actions genocide. The Ukrainians have been protected by the CIA for decades ONLY because they hated Russians. They continue to protect the Ukrainian Nazis only because they are waging war against Russia. No Ukrainian was ever prosecuted for war crimes that made the German Nazis look like amateurs. The Ukrainians were unprecedented in their war crimes during WWII, and the sheer outright cruelty has NEVER been addressed. They, above all, should have been hunted down more so than the Germans. The torture Ukrainians inflicted even on Polish and Hungarians, along with Russians and Jews, included: Running children through with stakes Cutting a person’s throat and pulling their tongue out through the hole Sawing a person’s torso in half with a carpenter’s saw Cutting open the belly of a woman in an advanced stage of pregnancy, removing the fetus, and replacing it with a live cat, before sewing up her abdomen. Cutting open a pregnant women’s abdomen and pouring in broken glass Nailing a small child to a door. There are numerous foreign soldiers who volunteered for Ukraine and then have returned shocked at the extent of the war crimes carried out by Ukrainians. You have no idea of the seething hatred of all Russian-speaking people in the Donbas or in Russia. A significant number of Ukrainians have no problem killing and torturing Russians. If you did your research, the extent of the cruelty of the Ukrainian Nazis even shocked the German Nazis. They would cut out a baby of a pregnant woman and so in a live cat. They killed countless people from Poland and the Russians as well as Jews. They do not teach what the Ukrainian Nazis did in Ukraine because it was too horrible. One report stated: “Some Ukrainian educators believe the Holocaust is not an appropriate topic for teaching because in a Holocaust course a professor would need to let Ukrainian students know that some Jews were betrayed to the Nazis by Ukrainian neighbors. In addition, the OUN and UPA took part in the annihilation of Jews in western Ukraine, and this knowledge can shock young Ukrainians. ” id/pg 205 I have videos that are too horrible to show of Ukrainians torturing Russian soldiers today, nailing them to a cross, and then setting them on fire. There are numerous foreign soldiers returning who are totally disgusted by what they have witnessed in Ukraine. One reported that they simply shot all the Russian soldiers they captured. Nobody will tell the truth because as long as they hate Russia, then Russia’s enemy is the West’s friend. The Ukrainian Neo-Nazis have been the most ruthless people I have ever encountered in history. Add to that, Ukraine is the most corrupt country in Europe even declared by the IMF. In fact, they may be the most corrupt in the world. Zelensky has called on NATO to use nuclear weapons to destroy Russia. This is the typical ethnic hatred that has always consumed Ukraine. They were the neo-Naris who joined Hitler because they were still practicing ethnic cleansing. They hate anyone other than Ukrainian and have killed hundreds of thousands of Polish, Hungarians, Russians, and even Jews. “We’re not asking for nuclear weapons to be given to us,” he claimed yet he has been raising the nuclear argument before Russia crossed the border. Last week, Zelensky implied that obtaining nuclear weapons should be provided if his country couldn’t join NATO. “Either Ukraine has nuclear weapons, which will serve as its protection, or it must be part of some kind of alliance.” There is no mistake about Zelensky. The Ukrainian people had better rise up against this modern-day Hitler who still harbors ethnic cleansing. Putin warned that this would be a very “dangerous provocation.” Zelensky is an evil, greedy person who only thinks about destroying Russia, just as the Ukrainians were doing for Hitler. Putin further added: “I can say right away that Russia will not allow this to happen under any circumstances.” Zelensky claimed his Victory Plan was not nuclear, just the total destruction of Russia. Any Western leader who gives anything to Ukraine is an absolute traitor to his people. This will end in World War III, the West WILL LOSE, and the world’s financial capital will move to Beijing. Anyone who supports Zelensky should be dragged out of office ASAP.

I don’t care how corrupt or “Nazi” Ukraine is. That’s internal stuff. Ukraine never invaded anyone. However, there’s a third player here. And that’s NATO. NATO recklessly expanded to the east after the Cold War ended. Russia would have to see that as being provocative. Just as JFK saw Soviet missiles in Cuba as being provocative. The Ukraine/Russia war. Plenty of stupidity and arrogance to assign there. 10 posted on 10/27/2024 10:27:08 AM PDT by Leaning Right (The steal is real.)

Because the “America First” crowd was dead wrong in WW2. But they were dead right in WW1. America (and Europe) would have been much better off if Wilson had resisted the pressure to enter the war. So what to do? Perhaps we should be - at least initially - guided by: America goes not abroad, in search of monsters to destroy.

Zelensky lied to get into office and pretended to be Christian, even baptizing g his two children. He promised peace to win, and my sources in Kiev swear the election was rigged. He promised peace, and has done everything put what he promised and then declared Martial Law so he does not have to stand for election every again as long as he can keep this war going. Heis VICTORY PLAN was nothing but to conquer and destroy Russia. He then suddenly became Jewish to select the fact that he was a Neo-Nazi and used to joke on stage about confiscating assets from Jews and Russians which he classified as the same. Friends in Israel do not consider him Jewish and he was pushing his claimed Jewish heritage and then asking for money implying this was vaguely connected to exterminating the Jews. The Pandora Papers revealed that Zelensky also had secret hidden offshore accounts along with all the other corrupt Ukrainian politicians. He had the audacity to claim that they were offshore protecting him against pro-Russian forces. In truth, these offshore accounts pre-dated him becoming president. Sources in Ukraine also claim that he was drafted and never showed up for military service. warned that if Zelensky were assassinated, he would be by a Ukrainian. He has destroyed his own country hoping to make a fortune on its reconstruction. Farmland is now bought by Blackrock, and the list of corruption is endless. Zelensky is looking for hundreds of billions to rebuild Ukraine and has the audacity to claim this will be the biggest investment project for Europe in modern history. The day before Russia came to the aid of the Donbas in this civil war that Kiev started on the alleged orders of Victoria Nuland, to ensure Putin would cross the border, he declared that Ukraine would rearm with nuclear weapons. That was the final straw; Putin even noted that in his address to Russia. It was not any different than the JFK and the Cuban Missile Crisis. The Washington Post found out that Zelensky knew when Russia would cross the border and did not warn his people. Like Hamas, he wanted civilians to be killed so he could blame Russia. When asked why he did not warn his people, he said it would have cost him $7 billion dollars. That is a war criminal. It was the American Neocons who instructed the UNELECTED Kiev government to attack the Russians in the Donbas and call them terrorists because they, too, wanted to separate from the Ukrainians who hate Russians and were killing them on the streets of Odesa. Zelendky staged the entirely false claim that Russia just killed civilians in Bucha. I have seen footage of pretend bodies with no visible blood lying in the streets, and as the car passed, they got up. There was no evidence of any such massacre. You have to understand that creating false flags is the #1 occupation of Ukraine. On March 31, 2022, the mayor of Bucha was joyful in announcing that the settlement had been liberated. He does not talk about any corpses on the roads and the terrible destruction of mass graves. It was two days later when suddenly photos and videos of people lying along the road appeared and horrendous stories about hundreds of dead being thrown in mass graves. These reports did not surface until two days after the Russians left. The Ukrainians were staging another false flag. Why did the mayor appear joyous and make no mention at first of these atrocities? This is why the West simply claimed there was no evidence and hid this was yet another Ukrainian False Flag trying to start World War III. Any Western Politician who votes for anything to support Ukraine should be charged with treason. Zelensky tried to claim Russia attacked Poland to start World War III. The evidence shows it was Ukraine that attacked Poland and tried to claim it was Russia. My RELIABLE sources insisted that it was Ukrainians who shot down the Malaysia fight and tried to blame the Russians. That was all covered up, and they blamed Russians in the Donbas. The West simply wants to destroy Russia. This is why Merkel lied to Putin and falsely negotiated the Minsk Agreement to buy time for Ukraine to build an army. This has been on the agenda for decades, and the fall of communism never changed that policy. They will do the same with China. In truth, this is Ukrainians invading the Russian territory where Russians have lived for centuries. The propaganda has flipped this completely around, claiming Putin was invading Ukraine when they began this civil war in 2014 and launched the first attacks on the Donbas. The treatment of Polish, Jews, and Russians during WWII even horrified the German Nazis. Why would Poland ever support Ukraine can only be that its leaders are told what to say and do by those behind NATO seeking World War III. The Polish people should wake up, for they will be the next to be thrown on this altar of geopolitical sacrifice. The Polish Association of Memory of Victims of Crimes of Ukrainian Nationalists documented 135 methods of torture and murder practiced by Ukrainian Nazis. Poland officially called the Ukrainian actions genocide. The Ukrainians have been protected by the CIA for decades ONLY because they hated Russians. They continue to protect the Ukrainian Nazis only because they are waging war against Russia. No Ukrainian was ever prosecuted for war crimes that made the German Nazis look like amateurs. The Ukrainians were unprecedented in their war crimes during WWII, and the sheer outright cruelty has NEVER been addressed. They, above all, should have been hunted down more so than the Germans. The torture Ukrainians inflicted even on Polish and Hungarians, along with Russians and Jews, included: Running children through with stakes Cutting a person’s throat and pulling their tongue out through the hole Sawing a person’s torso in half with a carpenter’s saw Cutting open the belly of a woman in an advanced stage of pregnancy, removing the fetus, and replacing it with a live cat, before sewing up her abdomen. Cutting open a pregnant women’s abdomen and pouring in broken glass Nailing a small child to a door. There are numerous foreign soldiers who volunteered for Ukraine and then have returned shocked at the extent of the war crimes carried out by Ukrainians. You have no idea of the seething hatred of all Russian-speaking people in the Donbas or in Russia. A significant number of Ukrainians have no problem killing and torturing Russians. If you did your research, the extent of the cruelty of the Ukrainian Nazis even shocked the German Nazis. They would cut out a baby of a pregnant woman and so in a live cat. They killed countless people from Poland and the Russians as well as Jews. They do not teach what the Ukrainian Nazis did in Ukraine because it was too horrible. One report stated: “Some Ukrainian educators believe the Holocaust is not an appropriate topic for teaching because in a Holocaust course a professor would need to let Ukrainian students know that some Jews were betrayed to the Nazis by Ukrainian neighbors. In addition, the OUN and UPA took part in the annihilation of Jews in western Ukraine, and this knowledge can shock young Ukrainians. ” id/pg 205 I have videos that are too horrible to show of Ukrainians torturing Russian soldiers today, nailing them to a cross, and then setting them on fire. There are numerous foreign soldiers returning who are totally disgusted by what they have witnessed in Ukraine. One reported that they simply shot all the Russian soldiers they captured. Nobody will tell the truth because as long as they hate Russia, then Russia’s enemy is the West’s friend. The Ukrainian Neo-Nazis have been the most ruthless people I have ever encountered in history. Add to that, Ukraine is the most corrupt country in Europe even declared by the IMF. In fact, they may be the most corrupt in the world. Zelensky has called on NATO to use nuclear weapons to destroy Russia. This is the typical ethnic hatred that has always consumed Ukraine. They were the neo-Naris who joined Hitler because they were still practicing ethnic cleansing. They hate anyone other than Ukrainian and have killed hundreds of thousands of Polish, Hungarians, Russians, and even Jews. “We’re not asking for nuclear weapons to be given to us,” he claimed yet he has been raising the nuclear argument before Russia crossed the border. Last week, Zelensky implied that obtaining nuclear weapons should be provided if his country couldn’t join NATO. “Either Ukraine has nuclear weapons, which will serve as its protection, or it must be part of some kind of alliance.” There is no mistake about Zelensky. The Ukrainian people had better rise up against this modern-day Hitler who still harbors ethnic cleansing. Putin warned that this would be a very “dangerous provocation.” Zelensky is an evil, greedy person who only thinks about destroying Russia, just as the Ukrainians were doing for Hitler. Putin further added: “I can say right away that Russia will not allow this to happen under any circumstances.” Zelensky claimed his Victory Plan was not nuclear, just the total destruction of Russia. Any Western leader who gives anything to Ukraine is an absolute traitor to his people. This will end in World War III, the West WILL LOSE, and the world’s financial capital will move to Beijing. Anyone who supports Zelensky should be dragged out of office ASAP.

Because the “America First” crowd was dead wrong in WW2. But they were dead right in WW1. America (and Europe) would have been much better off if Wilson had resisted the pressure to enter the war. So what to do? Perhaps we should be - at least initially - guided by: America goes not abroad, in search of monsters to destroy.

Because the “America First” crowd was dead wrong in WW2. But they were dead right in WW1. America (and Europe) would have been much better off if Wilson had resisted the pressure to enter the war. So what to do? Perhaps we should be - at least initially - guided by: America goes not abroad, in search of monsters to destroy.

Friends in Israel do not consider him Jewish and he was pushing his claimed Jewish heritage and then asking for money implying this was vaguely connected to exterminating the Jews. The Pandora Papers revealed that Zelensky also had secret hidden offshore accounts along with all the other corrupt Ukrainian politicians. He had the audacity to claim that they were offshore protecting him against pro-Russian forces. In truth, these offshore accounts pre-dated him becoming president. Sources in Ukraine also claim that he was drafted and never showed up for military service. warned that if Zelensky were assassinated, he would be by a Ukrainian. He has destroyed his own country hoping to make a fortune on its reconstruction. Farmland is now bought by Blackrock, and the list of corruption is endless. Zelensky is looking for hundreds of billions to rebuild Ukraine and has the audacity to claim this will be the biggest investment project for Europe in modern history. The day before Russia came to the aid of the Donbas in this civil war that Kiev started on the alleged orders of Victoria Nuland, to ensure Putin would cross the border, he declared that Ukraine would rearm with nuclear weapons. That was the final straw; Putin even noted that in his address to Russia. It was not any different than the JFK and the Cuban Missile Crisis. The Washington Post found out that Zelensky knew when Russia would cross the border and did not warn his people. Like Hamas, he wanted civilians to be killed so he could blame Russia. When asked why he did not warn his people, he said it would have cost him $7 billion dollars. That is a war criminal. It was the American Neocons who instructed the UNELECTED Kiev government to attack the Russians in the Donbas and call them terrorists because they, too, wanted to separate from the Ukrainians who hate Russians and were killing them on the streets of Odesa. Zelendky staged the entirely false claim that Russia just killed civilians in Bucha. I have seen footage of pretend bodies with no visible blood lying in the streets, and as the car passed, they got up. There was no evidence of any such massacre. You have to understand that creating false flags is the #1 occupation of Ukraine. On March 31, 2022, the mayor of Bucha was joyful in announcing that the settlement had been liberated. He does not talk about any corpses on the roads and the terrible destruction of mass graves. It was two days later when suddenly photos and videos of people lying along the road appeared and horrendous stories about hundreds of dead being thrown in mass graves. These reports did not surface until two days after the Russians left. The Ukrainians were staging another false flag. Why did the mayor appear joyous and make no mention at first of these atrocities? This is why the West simply claimed there was no evidence and hid this was yet another Ukrainian False Flag trying to start World War III. Any Western Politician who votes for anything to support Ukraine should be charged with treason. Zelensky tried to claim Russia attacked Poland to start World War III. The evidence shows it was Ukraine that attacked Poland and tried to claim it was Russia. My RELIABLE sources insisted that it was Ukrainians who shot down the Malaysia fight and tried to blame the Russians. That was all covered up, and they blamed Russians in the Donbas. The West simply wants to destroy Russia. This is why Merkel lied to Putin and falsely negotiated the Minsk Agreement to buy time for Ukraine to build an army. This has been on the agenda for decades, and the fall of communism never changed that policy. They will do the same with China. In truth, this is Ukrainians invading the Russian territory where Russians have lived for centuries. The propaganda has flipped this completely around, claiming Putin was invading Ukraine when they began this civil war in 2014 and launched the first attacks on the Donbas. The treatment of Polish, Jews, and Russians during WWII even horrified the German Nazis. Why would Poland ever support Ukraine can only be that its leaders are told what to say and do by those behind NATO seeking World War III. The Polish people should wake up, for they will be the next to be thrown on this altar of geopolitical sacrifice. The Polish Association of Memory of Victims of Crimes of Ukrainian Nationalists documented 135 methods of torture and murder practiced by Ukrainian Nazis.

They continue to protect the Ukrainian Nazis only because they are waging war against Russia. No Ukrainian was ever prosecuted for war crimes that made the German Nazis look like amateurs. The Ukrainians were unprecedented in their war crimes during WWII, and the sheer outright cruelty has NEVER been addressed. They, above all, should have been hunted down more so than the Germans. The torture Ukrainians inflicted even on Polish and Hungarians, along with Russians and Jews, included: Running children through with stakes Cutting a person’s throat and pulling their tongue out through the hole Sawing a person’s torso in half with a carpenter’s saw Cutting open the belly of a woman in an advanced stage of pregnancy, removing the fetus, and replacing it with a live cat, before sewing up her abdomen.

One report stated: “Some Ukrainian educators believe the Holocaust is not an appropriate topic for teaching because in a Holocaust course a professor would need to let Ukrainian students know that some Jews were betrayed to the Nazis by Ukrainian neighbors.

The Ukrainian Neo-Nazis have been the most ruthless people I have ever encountered in history. Add to that, Ukraine is the most corrupt country in Europe even declared by the IMF. In fact, they may be the most corrupt in the world. Zelensky has called on NATO to use nuclear weapons to destroy Russia. This is the typical ethnic hatred that has always consumed Ukraine.

Last week, Zelensky implied that obtaining nuclear weapons should be provided if his country couldn’t join NATO. “Either Ukraine has nuclear weapons, which will serve as its protection, or it must be part of some kind of alliance.” There is no mistake about Zelensky. The Ukrainian people had better rise up against this modern-day Hitler who still harbors ethnic cleansing. Putin warned that this would be a very “dangerous provocation.” Zelensky is an evil, greedy person who only thinks about destroying Russia, just as the Ukrainians were doing for Hitler. Putin further added: “I can say right away that Russia will not allow this to happen under any circumstances.” Zelensky claimed his Victory Plan was not nuclear, just the total destruction of Russia.

I don’t care how corrupt or “Nazi” Ukraine is. That’s internal stuff. Ukraine never invaded anyone. However, there’s a third player here. And that’s NATO. NATO recklessly expanded to the east after the Cold War ended. Russia would have to see that as being provocative. Just as JFK saw Soviet missiles in Cuba as being provocative.

He has destroyed his own country hoping to make a fortune on its reconstruction. Farmland is now bought by Blackrock, and the list of corruption is endless. Zelensky is looking for hundreds of billions to rebuild Ukraine and has the audacity to claim this will be the biggest investment project for Europe in modern history. The day before Russia came to the aid of the Donbas in this civil war that Kiev started on the alleged orders of Victoria Nuland, to ensure Putin would cross the border, he declared that Ukraine would rearm with nuclear weapons. That was the final straw; Putin even noted that in his address to Russia. It was not any different than the JFK and the Cuban Missile Crisis. The Washington Post found out that Zelensky knew when Russia would cross the border and did not warn his people. Like Hamas, he wanted civilians to be killed so he could blame Russia. When asked why he did not warn his people, he said it would have cost him $7 billion dollars. That is a war criminal. It was the American Neocons who instructed the UNELECTED Kiev government to attack the Russians in the Donbas and call them terrorists because they, too, wanted to separate from the Ukrainians who hate Russians and were killing them on the streets of Odesa. Zelendky staged the entirely false claim that Russia just killed civilians in Bucha. I have seen footage of pretend bodies with no visible blood lying in the streets, and as the car passed, they got up. There was no evidence of any such massacre. You have to understand that creating false flags is the #1 occupation of Ukraine. On March 31, 2022, the mayor of Bucha was joyful in announcing that the settlement had been liberated. He does not talk about any corpses on the roads and the terrible destruction of mass graves. It was two days later when suddenly photos and videos of people lying along the road appeared and horrendous stories about hundreds of dead being thrown in mass graves. These reports did not surface until two days after the Russians left. The Ukrainians were staging another false flag. Why did the mayor appear joyous and make no mention at first of these atrocities? This is why the West simply claimed there was no evidence and hid this was yet another Ukrainian False Flag trying to start World War III. Any Western Politician who votes for anything to support Ukraine should be charged with treason. Zelensky tried to claim Russia attacked Poland to start World War III. The evidence shows it was Ukraine that attacked Poland and tried to claim it was Russia. My RELIABLE sources insisted that it was Ukrainians who shot down the Malaysia fight and tried to blame the Russians. That was all covered up, and they blamed Russians in the Donbas. The West simply wants to destroy Russia. This is why Merkel lied to Putin and falsely negotiated the Minsk Agreement to buy time for Ukraine to build an army. This has been on the agenda for decades, and the fall of communism never changed that policy. They will do the same with China. In truth, this is Ukrainians invading the Russian territory where Russians have lived for centuries. The propaganda has flipped this completely around, claiming Putin was invading Ukraine when they began this civil war in 2014 and launched the first attacks on the Donbas. The treatment of Polish, Jews, and Russians during WWII even horrified the German Nazis. Why would Poland ever support Ukraine can only be that its leaders are told what to say and do by those behind NATO seeking World War III. The Polish people should wake up, for they will be the next to be thrown on this altar of geopolitical sacrifice. The Polish Association of Memory of Victims of Crimes of Ukrainian Nationalists documented 135 methods of torture and murder practiced by Ukrainian Nazis. Poland officially called the Ukrainian actions genocide. The Ukrainians have been protected by the CIA for decades ONLY because they hated Russians. They continue to protect the Ukrainian Nazis only because they are waging war against Russia. No Ukrainian was ever prosecuted for war crimes that made the German Nazis look like amateurs. The Ukrainians were unprecedented in their war crimes during WWII, and the sheer outright cruelty has NEVER been addressed. They, above all, should have been hunted down more so than the Germans. The torture Ukrainians inflicted even on Polish and Hungarians, along with Russians and Jews, included: Running children through with stakes Cutting a person’s throat and pulling their tongue out through the hole Sawing a person’s torso in half with a carpenter’s saw Cutting open the belly of a woman in an advanced stage of pregnancy, removing the fetus, and replacing it with a live cat, before sewing up her abdomen. Cutting open a pregnant women’s abdomen and pouring in broken glass Nailing a small child to a door. There are numerous foreign soldiers who volunteered for Ukraine and then have returned shocked at the extent of the war crimes carried out by Ukrainians. You have no idea of the seething hatred of all Russian-speaking people in the Donbas or in Russia. A significant number of Ukrainians have no problem killing and torturing Russians. If you did your research, the extent of the cruelty of the Ukrainian Nazis even shocked the German Nazis. They would cut out a baby of a pregnant woman and so in a live cat. They killed countless people from Poland and the Russians as well as Jews. They do not teach what the Ukrainian Nazis did in Ukraine because it was too horrible. One report stated: “Some Ukrainian educators believe the Holocaust is not an appropriate topic for teaching because in a Holocaust course a professor would need to let Ukrainian students know that some Jews were betrayed to the Nazis by Ukrainian neighbors. In addition, the OUN and UPA took part in the annihilation of Jews in western Ukraine, and this knowledge can shock young Ukrainians. ” id/pg 205 I have videos that are too horrible to show of Ukrainians torturing Russian soldiers today, nailing them to a cross, and then setting them on fire. There are numerous foreign soldiers returning who are totally disgusted by what they have witnessed in Ukraine. One reported that they simply shot all the Russian soldiers they captured. Nobody will tell the truth because as long as they hate Russia, then Russia’s enemy is the West’s friend. The Ukrainian Neo-Nazis have been the most ruthless people I have ever encountered in history. Add to that, Ukraine is the most corrupt country in Europe even declared by the IMF. In fact, they may be the most corrupt in the world. Zelensky has called on NATO to use nuclear weapons to destroy Russia. This is the typical ethnic hatred that has always consumed Ukraine. They were the neo-Naris who joined Hitler because they were still practicing ethnic cleansing. They hate anyone other than Ukrainian and have killed hundreds of thousands of Polish, Hungarians, Russians, and even Jews. “We’re not asking for nuclear weapons to be given to us,” he claimed yet he has been raising the nuclear argument before Russia crossed the border. Last week, Zelensky implied that obtaining nuclear weapons should be provided if his country couldn’t join NATO. “Either Ukraine has nuclear weapons, which will serve as its protection, or it must be part of some kind of alliance.” There is no mistake about Zelensky. The Ukrainian people had better rise up against this modern-day Hitler who still harbors ethnic cleansing. Putin warned that this would be a very “dangerous provocation.” Zelensky is an evil, greedy person who only thinks about destroying Russia, just as the Ukrainians were doing for Hitler. Putin further added: “I can say right away that Russia will not allow this to happen under any circumstances.” Zelensky claimed his Victory Plan was not nuclear, just the total destruction of Russia. Any Western leader who gives anything to Ukraine is an absolute traitor to his people. This will end in World War III, the West WILL LOSE, and the world’s financial capital will move to Beijing. Anyone who supports Zelensky should be dragged out of office ASAP.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson The Washington Post found out that Zelensky knew when Russia would cross the border and did not warn his people. Like Hamas, he wanted civilians to be killed so he could blame Russia. When asked why he did not warn his people, he said it would have cost him $7 billion dollars. That is a war criminal. It was the American Neocons who instructed the UNELECTED Kiev government to attack the Russians in the Donbas and call them terrorists because they, too, wanted to separate from the Ukrainians who hate Russians and were killing them on the streets of Odesa. Zelendky staged the entirely false claim that Russia just killed civilians in Bucha. I have seen footage of pretend bodies with no visible blood lying in the streets, and as the car passed, they got up. There was no evidence of any such massacre. You have to understand that creating false flags is the #1 occupation of Ukraine. On March 31, 2022, the mayor of Bucha was joyful in announcing that the settlement had been liberated. He does not talk about any corpses on the roads and the terrible destruction of mass graves. It was two days later when suddenly photos and videos of people lying along the road appeared and horrendous stories about hundreds of dead being thrown in mass graves. These reports did not surface until two days after the Russians left. The Ukrainians were staging another false flag. Why did the mayor appear joyous and make no mention at first of these atrocities? This is why the West simply claimed there was no evidence and hid this was yet another Ukrainian False Flag trying to start World War III. Any Western Politician who votes for anything to support Ukraine should be charged with treason. Zelensky tried to claim Russia attacked Poland to start World War III. The evidence shows it was Ukraine that attacked Poland and tried to claim it was Russia. My RELIABLE sources insisted that it was Ukrainians who shot down the Malaysia fight and tried to blame the Russians. That was all covered up, and they blamed Russians in the Donbas. The West simply wants to destroy Russia. This is why Merkel lied to Putin and falsely negotiated the Minsk Agreement to buy time for Ukraine to build an army. This has been on the agenda for decades, and the fall of communism never changed that policy. They will do the same with China. In truth, this is Ukrainians invading the Russian territory where Russians have lived for centuries. The propaganda has flipped this completely around, claiming Putin was invading Ukraine when they began this civil war in 2014 and launched the first attacks on the Donbas. The treatment of Polish, Jews, and Russians during WWII even horrified the German Nazis. Why would Poland ever support Ukraine can only be that its leaders are told what to say and do by those behind NATO seeking World War III. The Polish people should wake up, for they will be the next to be thrown on this altar of geopolitical sacrifice. The Polish Association of Memory of Victims of Crimes of Ukrainian Nationalists documented 135 methods of torture and murder practiced by Ukrainian Nazis. Poland officially called the Ukrainian actions genocide. The Ukrainians have been protected by the CIA for decades ONLY because they hated Russians. They continue to protect the Ukrainian Nazis only because they are waging war against Russia. No Ukrainian was ever prosecuted for war crimes that made the German Nazis look like amateurs. The Ukrainians were unprecedented in their war crimes during WWII, and the sheer outright cruelty has NEVER been addressed. They, above all, should have been hunted down more so than the Germans. The torture Ukrainians inflicted even on Polish and Hungarians, along with Russians and Jews, included: Running children through with stakes Cutting a person’s throat and pulling their tongue out through the hole Sawing a person’s torso in half with a carpenter’s saw Cutting open the belly of a woman in an advanced stage of pregnancy, removing the fetus, and replacing it with a live cat, before sewing up her abdomen. Cutting open a pregnant women’s abdomen and pouring in broken glass Nailing a small child to a door. There are numerous foreign soldiers who volunteered for Ukraine and then have returned shocked at the extent of the war crimes carried out by Ukrainians. You have no idea of the seething hatred of all Russian-speaking people in the Donbas or in Russia. A significant number of Ukrainians have no problem killing and torturing Russians. If you did your research, the extent of the cruelty of the Ukrainian Nazis even shocked the German Nazis. They would cut out a baby of a pregnant woman and so in a live cat. They killed countless people from Poland and the Russians as well as Jews. They do not teach what the Ukrainian Nazis did in Ukraine because it was too horrible. One report stated: “Some Ukrainian educators believe the Holocaust is not an appropriate topic for teaching because in a Holocaust course a professor would need to let Ukrainian students know that some Jews were betrayed to the Nazis by Ukrainian neighbors. In addition, the OUN and UPA took part in the annihilation of Jews in western Ukraine, and this knowledge can shock young Ukrainians. ” id/pg 205 I have videos that are too horrible to show of Ukrainians torturing Russian soldiers today, nailing them to a cross, and then setting them on fire. There are numerous foreign soldiers returning who are totally disgusted by what they have witnessed in Ukraine. One reported that they simply shot all the Russian soldiers they captured. Nobody will tell the truth because as long as they hate Russia, then Russia’s enemy is the West’s friend. The Ukrainian Neo-Nazis have been the most ruthless people I have ever encountered in history. Add to that, Ukraine is the most corrupt country in Europe even declared by the IMF. In fact, they may be the most corrupt in the world. Zelensky has called on NATO to use nuclear weapons to destroy Russia. This is the typical ethnic hatred that has always consumed Ukraine. They were the neo-Naris who joined Hitler because they were still practicing ethnic cleansing. They hate anyone other than Ukrainian and have killed hundreds of thousands of Polish, Hungarians, Russians, and even Jews. “We’re not asking for nuclear weapons to be given to us,” he claimed yet he has been raising the nuclear argument before Russia crossed the border. Last week, Zelensky implied that obtaining nuclear weapons should be provided if his country couldn’t join NATO. “Either Ukraine has nuclear weapons, which will serve as its protection, or it must be part of some kind of alliance.” There is no mistake about Zelensky. The Ukrainian people had better rise up against this modern-day Hitler who still harbors ethnic cleansing. Putin warned that this would be a very “dangerous provocation.” Zelensky is an evil, greedy person who only thinks about destroying Russia, just as the Ukrainians were doing for Hitler. Putin further added: “I can say right away that Russia will not allow this to happen under any circumstances.” Zelensky claimed his Victory Plan was not nuclear, just the total destruction of Russia. Any Western leader who gives anything to Ukraine is an absolute traitor to his people. This will end in World War III, the West WILL LOSE, and the world’s financial capital will move to Beijing. Anyone who supports Zelensky should be dragged out of office ASAP.

Last week, Zelensky implied that obtaining nuclear weapons should be provided if his country couldn’t join NATO. “Either Ukraine has nuclear weapons, which will serve as its protection, or it must be part of some kind of alliance.” There is no mistake about Zelensky. The Ukrainian people had better rise up against this modern-day Hitler who still harbors ethnic cleansing. Putin warned that this would be a very “dangerous provocation.” Zelensky is an evil, greedy person who only thinks about destroying Russia, just as the Ukrainians were doing for Hitler. Putin further added: “I can say right away that Russia will not allow this to happen under any circumstances.” Zelensky claimed his Victory Plan was not nuclear, just the total destruction of Russia. Any Western leader who gives anything to Ukraine is an absolute traitor to his people. This will end in World War III, the West WILL LOSE, and the world’s financial capital will move to Beijing. Anyone who supports Zelensky should be dragged out of office ASAP.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Zelendky staged the entirely false claim that Russia just killed civilians in Bucha. I have seen footage of pretend bodies with no visible blood lying in the streets, and as the car passed, they got up. There was no evidence of any such massacre. You have to understand that creating false flags is the #1 occupation of Ukraine. On March 31, 2022, the mayor of Bucha was joyful in announcing that the settlement had been liberated. He does not talk about any corpses on the roads and the terrible destruction of mass graves. It was two days later when suddenly photos and videos of people lying along the road appeared and horrendous stories about hundreds of dead being thrown in mass graves. These reports did not surface until two days after the Russians left. The Ukrainians were staging another false flag. Why did the mayor appear joyous and make no mention at first of these atrocities? This is why the West simply claimed there was no evidence and hid this was yet another Ukrainian False Flag trying to start World War III. Any Western Politician who votes for anything to support Ukraine should be charged with treason. Zelensky tried to claim Russia attacked Poland to start World War III. The evidence shows it was Ukraine that attacked Poland and tried to claim it was Russia. My RELIABLE sources insisted that it was Ukrainians who shot down the Malaysia fight and tried to blame the Russians. That was all covered up, and they blamed Russians in the Donbas. The West simply wants to destroy Russia. This is why Merkel lied to Putin and falsely negotiated the Minsk Agreement to buy time for Ukraine to build an army. This has been on the agenda for decades, and the fall of communism never changed that policy. They will do the same with China. In truth, this is Ukrainians invading the Russian territory where Russians have lived for centuries. The propaganda has flipped this completely around, claiming Putin was invading Ukraine when they began this civil war in 2014 and launched the first attacks on the Donbas. The treatment of Polish, Jews, and Russians during WWII even horrified the German Nazis. Why would Poland ever support Ukraine can only be that its leaders are told what to say and do by those behind NATO seeking World War III. The Polish people should wake up, for they will be the next to be thrown on this altar of geopolitical sacrifice. The Polish Association of Memory of Victims of Crimes of Ukrainian Nationalists documented 135 methods of torture and murder practiced by Ukrainian Nazis. Poland officially called the Ukrainian actions genocide. The Ukrainians have been protected by the CIA for decades ONLY because they hated Russians. They continue to protect the Ukrainian Nazis only because they are waging war against Russia. No Ukrainian was ever prosecuted for war crimes that made the German Nazis look like amateurs. The Ukrainians were unprecedented in their war crimes during WWII, and the sheer outright cruelty has NEVER been addressed. They, above all, should have been hunted down more so than the Germans. The torture Ukrainians inflicted even on Polish and Hungarians, along with Russians and Jews, included: Running children through with stakes Cutting a person’s throat and pulling their tongue out through the hole Sawing a person’s torso in half with a carpenter’s saw Cutting open the belly of a woman in an advanced stage of pregnancy, removing the fetus, and replacing it with a live cat, before sewing up her abdomen. Cutting open a pregnant women’s abdomen and pouring in broken glass Nailing a small child to a door. There are numerous foreign soldiers who volunteered for Ukraine and then have returned shocked at the extent of the war crimes carried out by Ukrainians. You have no idea of the seething hatred of all Russian-speaking people in the Donbas or in Russia. A significant number of Ukrainians have no problem killing and torturing Russians. If you did your research, the extent of the cruelty of the Ukrainian Nazis even shocked the German Nazis. They would cut out a baby of a pregnant woman and so in a live cat. They killed countless people from Poland and the Russians as well as Jews. They do not teach what the Ukrainian Nazis did in Ukraine because it was too horrible. One report stated: “Some Ukrainian educators believe the Holocaust is not an appropriate topic for teaching because in a Holocaust course a professor would need to let Ukrainian students know that some Jews were betrayed to the Nazis by Ukrainian neighbors. In addition, the OUN and UPA took part in the annihilation of Jews in western Ukraine, and this knowledge can shock young Ukrainians. ” id/pg 205 I have videos that are too horrible to show of Ukrainians torturing Russian soldiers today, nailing them to a cross, and then setting them on fire. There are numerous foreign soldiers returning who are totally disgusted by what they have witnessed in Ukraine. One reported that they simply shot all the Russian soldiers they captured. Nobody will tell the truth because as long as they hate Russia, then Russia’s enemy is the West’s friend. The Ukrainian Neo-Nazis have been the most ruthless people I have ever encountered in history. Add to that, Ukraine is the most corrupt country in Europe even declared by the IMF. In fact, they may be the most corrupt in the world. Zelensky has called on NATO to use nuclear weapons to destroy Russia. This is the typical ethnic hatred that has always consumed Ukraine. They were the neo-Naris who joined Hitler because they were still practicing ethnic cleansing. They hate anyone other than Ukrainian and have killed hundreds of thousands of Polish, Hungarians, Russians, and even Jews. “We’re not asking for nuclear weapons to be given to us,” he claimed yet he has been raising the nuclear argument before Russia crossed the border.

Last week, Zelensky implied that obtaining nuclear weapons should be provided if his country couldn’t join NATO. “Either Ukraine has nuclear weapons, which will serve as its protection, or it must be part of some kind of alliance.” There is no mistake about Zelensky. The Ukrainian people had better rise up against this modern-day Hitler who still harbors ethnic cleansing. Putin warned that this would be a very “dangerous provocation.” Zelensky is an evil, greedy person who only thinks about destroying Russia, just as the Ukrainians were doing for Hitler. Putin further added: “I can say right away that Russia will not allow this to happen under any circumstances.” Zelensky claimed his Victory Plan was not nuclear, just the total destruction of Russia. Any Western leader who gives anything to Ukraine is an absolute traitor to his people. This will end in World War III, the West WILL LOSE, and the world’s financial capital will move to Beijing. Anyone who supports Zelensky should be dragged out of office ASAP.

Because the “America First” crowd was dead wrong in WW2. But they were dead right in WW1. America (and Europe) would have been much better off if Wilson had resisted the pressure to enter the war. So what to do? Perhaps we should be - at least initially - guided by: America goes not abroad, in search of monsters to destroy.

This is why the West simply claimed there was no evidence and hid this was yet another Ukrainian False Flag trying to start World War III. Any Western Politician who votes for anything to support Ukraine should be charged with treason. Zelensky tried to claim Russia attacked Poland to start World War III. The evidence shows it was Ukraine that attacked Poland and tried to claim it was Russia. My RELIABLE sources insisted that it was Ukrainians who shot down the Malaysia fight and tried to blame the Russians. That was all covered up, and they blamed Russians in the Donbas. The West simply wants to destroy Russia. This is why Merkel lied to Putin and falsely negotiated the Minsk Agreement to buy time for Ukraine to build an army. This has been on the agenda for decades, and the fall of communism never changed that policy. They will do the same with China. In truth, this is Ukrainians invading the Russian territory where Russians have lived for centuries. The propaganda has flipped this completely around, claiming Putin was invading Ukraine when they began this civil war in 2014 and launched the first attacks on the Donbas. The treatment of Polish, Jews, and Russians during WWII even horrified the German Nazis. Why would Poland ever support Ukraine can only be that its leaders are told what to say and do by those behind NATO seeking World War III. The Polish people should wake up, for they will be the next to be thrown on this altar of geopolitical sacrifice. The Polish Association of Memory of Victims of Crimes of Ukrainian Nationalists documented 135 methods of torture and murder practiced by Ukrainian Nazis. Poland officially called the Ukrainian actions genocide. The Ukrainians have been protected by the CIA for decades ONLY because they hated Russians. They continue to protect the Ukrainian Nazis only because they are waging war against Russia. No Ukrainian was ever prosecuted for war crimes that made the German Nazis look like amateurs. The Ukrainians were unprecedented in their war crimes during WWII, and the sheer outright cruelty has NEVER been addressed. They, above all, should have been hunted down more so than the Germans. The torture Ukrainians inflicted even on Polish and Hungarians, along with Russians and Jews, included: Running children through with stakes Cutting a person’s throat and pulling their tongue out through the hole Sawing a person’s torso in half with a carpenter’s saw Cutting open the belly of a woman in an advanced stage of pregnancy, removing the fetus, and replacing it with a live cat, before sewing up her abdomen. Cutting open a pregnant women’s abdomen and pouring in broken glass Nailing a small child to a door. There are numerous foreign soldiers who volunteered for Ukraine and then have returned shocked at the extent of the war crimes carried out by Ukrainians. You have no idea of the seething hatred of all Russian-speaking people in the Donbas or in Russia. A significant number of Ukrainians have no problem killing and torturing Russians. If you did your research, the extent of the cruelty of the Ukrainian Nazis even shocked the German Nazis. They would cut out a baby of a pregnant woman and so in a live cat. They killed countless people from Poland and the Russians as well as Jews. They do not teach what the Ukrainian Nazis did in Ukraine because it was too horrible. One report stated: “Some Ukrainian educators believe the Holocaust is not an appropriate topic for teaching because in a Holocaust course a professor would need to let Ukrainian students know that some Jews were betrayed to the Nazis by Ukrainian neighbors. In addition, the OUN and UPA took part in the annihilation of Jews in western Ukraine, and this knowledge can shock young Ukrainians. ” id/pg 205 I have videos that are too horrible to show of Ukrainians torturing Russian soldiers today, nailing them to a cross, and then setting them on fire. There are numerous foreign soldiers returning who are totally disgusted by what they have witnessed in Ukraine. One reported that they simply shot all the Russian soldiers they captured. Nobody will tell the truth because as long as they hate Russia, then Russia’s enemy is the West’s friend. The Ukrainian Neo-Nazis have been the most ruthless people I have ever encountered in history. Add to that, Ukraine is the most corrupt country in Europe even declared by the IMF. In fact, they may be the most corrupt in the world. Zelensky has called on NATO to use nuclear weapons to destroy Russia. This is the typical ethnic hatred that has always consumed Ukraine.

Because the “America First” crowd was dead wrong in WW2. But they were dead right in WW1. America (and Europe) would have been much better off if Wilson had resisted the pressure to enter the war. So what to do? Perhaps we should be - at least initially - guided by: America goes not abroad, in search of monsters to destroy.

This is why Merkel lied to Putin and falsely negotiated the Minsk Agreement to buy time for Ukraine to build an army. This has been on the agenda for decades, and the fall of communism never changed that policy. They will do the same with China. In truth, this is Ukrainians invading the Russian territory where Russians have lived for centuries. The propaganda has flipped this completely around, claiming Putin was invading Ukraine when they began this civil war in 2014 and launched the first attacks on the Donbas. The treatment of Polish, Jews, and Russians during WWII even horrified the German Nazis. Why would Poland ever support Ukraine can only be that its leaders are told what to say and do by those behind NATO seeking World War III. The Polish people should wake up, for they will be the next to be thrown on this altar of geopolitical sacrifice. The Polish Association of Memory of Victims of Crimes of Ukrainian Nationalists documented 135 methods of torture and murder practiced by Ukrainian Nazis. Poland officially called the Ukrainian actions genocide. The Ukrainians have been protected by the CIA for decades ONLY because they hated Russians. They continue to protect the Ukrainian Nazis only because they are waging war against Russia. No Ukrainian was ever prosecuted for war crimes that made the German Nazis look like amateurs. The Ukrainians were unprecedented in their war crimes during WWII, and the sheer outright cruelty has NEVER been addressed. They, above all, should have been hunted down more so than the Germans. The torture Ukrainians inflicted even on Polish and Hungarians, along with Russians and Jews, included: Running children through with stakes Cutting a person’s throat and pulling their tongue out through the hole Sawing a person’s torso in half with a carpenter’s saw Cutting open the belly of a woman in an advanced stage of pregnancy, removing the fetus, and replacing it with a live cat, before sewing up her abdomen. Cutting open a pregnant women’s abdomen and pouring in broken glass Nailing a small child to a door. There are numerous foreign soldiers who volunteered for Ukraine and then have returned shocked at the extent of the war crimes carried out by Ukrainians. You have no idea of the seething hatred of all Russian-speaking people in the Donbas or in Russia. A significant number of Ukrainians have no problem killing and torturing Russians. If you did your research, the extent of the cruelty of the Ukrainian Nazis even shocked the German Nazis. They would cut out a baby of a pregnant woman and so in a live cat. They killed countless people from Poland and the Russians as well as Jews. They do not teach what the Ukrainian Nazis did in Ukraine because it was too horrible. One report stated: “Some Ukrainian educators believe the Holocaust is not an appropriate topic for teaching because in a Holocaust course a professor would need to let Ukrainian students know that some Jews were betrayed to the Nazis by Ukrainian neighbors. In addition, the OUN and UPA took part in the annihilation of Jews in western Ukraine, and this knowledge can shock young Ukrainians. ” id/pg 205 I have videos that are too horrible to show of Ukrainians torturing Russian soldiers today, nailing them to a cross, and then setting them on fire. There are numerous foreign soldiers returning who are totally disgusted by what they have witnessed in Ukraine. One reported that they simply shot all the Russian soldiers they captured. Nobody will tell the truth because as long as they hate Russia, then Russia’s enemy is the West’s friend. The Ukrainian Neo-Nazis have been the most ruthless people I have ever encountered in history. Add to that, Ukraine is the most corrupt country in Europe even declared by the IMF. In fact, they may be the most corrupt in the world. Zelensky has called on NATO to use nuclear weapons to destroy Russia. This is the typical ethnic hatred that has always consumed Ukraine. They were the neo-Naris who joined Hitler because they were still practicing ethnic cleansing. They hate anyone other than Ukrainian and have killed hundreds of thousands of Polish, Hungarians, Russians, and even Jews. “We’re not asking for nuclear weapons to be given to us,” he claimed yet he has been raising the nuclear argument before Russia crossed the border. Last week, Zelensky implied that obtaining nuclear weapons should be provided if his country couldn’t join NATO. “Either Ukraine has nuclear weapons, which will serve as its protection, or it must be part of some kind of alliance.” There is no mistake about Zelensky. The Ukrainian people had better rise up against this modern-day Hitler who still harbors ethnic cleansing. Putin warned that this would be a very “dangerous provocation.” Zelensky is an evil, greedy person who only thinks about destroying Russia, just as the Ukrainians were doing for Hitler. Putin further added: “I can say right away that Russia will not allow this to happen under any circumstances.” Zelensky claimed his Victory Plan was not nuclear, just the total destruction of Russia. Any Western leader who gives anything to Ukraine is an absolute traitor to his people. This will end in World War III, the West WILL LOSE, and the world’s financial capital will move to Beijing. Anyone who supports Zelensky should be dragged out of office ASAP.

Because the “America First” crowd was dead wrong in WW2. But they were dead right in WW1. America (and Europe) would have been much better off if Wilson had resisted the pressure to enter the war. So what to do? Perhaps we should be - at least initially - guided by: America goes not abroad, in search of monsters to destroy.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson The Polish Association of Memory of Victims of Crimes of Ukrainian Nationalists documented 135 methods of torture and murder practiced by Ukrainian Nazis. Poland officially called the Ukrainian actions genocide. The Ukrainians have been protected by the CIA for decades ONLY because they hated Russians. They continue to protect the Ukrainian Nazis only because they are waging war against Russia. No Ukrainian was ever prosecuted for war crimes that made the German Nazis look like amateurs. The Ukrainians were unprecedented in their war crimes during WWII, and the sheer outright cruelty has NEVER been addressed. They, above all, should have been hunted down more so than the Germans. The torture Ukrainians inflicted even on Polish and Hungarians, along with Russians and Jews, included: Running children through with stakes Cutting a person’s throat and pulling their tongue out through the hole Sawing a person’s torso in half with a carpenter’s saw Cutting open the belly of a woman in an advanced stage of pregnancy, removing the fetus, and replacing it with a live cat, before sewing up her abdomen. Cutting open a pregnant women’s abdomen and pouring in broken glass Nailing a small child to a door. There are numerous foreign soldiers who volunteered for Ukraine and then have returned shocked at the extent of the war crimes carried out by Ukrainians. You have no idea of the seething hatred of all Russian-speaking people in the Donbas or in Russia. A significant number of Ukrainians have no problem killing and torturing Russians. If you did your research, the extent of the cruelty of the Ukrainian Nazis even shocked the German Nazis. They would cut out a baby of a pregnant woman and so in a live cat. They killed countless people from Poland and the Russians as well as Jews. They do not teach what the Ukrainian Nazis did in Ukraine because it was too horrible. One report stated: “Some Ukrainian educators believe the Holocaust is not an appropriate topic for teaching because in a Holocaust course a professor would need to let Ukrainian students know that some Jews were betrayed to the Nazis by Ukrainian neighbors. In addition, the OUN and UPA took part in the annihilation of Jews in western Ukraine, and this knowledge can shock young Ukrainians. ” id/pg 205 I have videos that are too horrible to show of Ukrainians torturing Russian soldiers today, nailing them to a cross, and then setting them on fire. There are numerous foreign soldiers returning who are totally disgusted by what they have witnessed in Ukraine. One reported that they simply shot all the Russian soldiers they captured. Nobody will tell the truth because as long as they hate Russia, then Russia’s enemy is the West’s friend. The Ukrainian Neo-Nazis have been the most ruthless people I have ever encountered in history. Add to that, Ukraine is the most corrupt country in Europe even declared by the IMF. In fact, they may be the most corrupt in the world. Zelensky has called on NATO to use nuclear weapons to destroy Russia. This is the typical ethnic hatred that has always consumed Ukraine. They were the neo-Naris who joined Hitler because they were still practicing ethnic cleansing. They hate anyone other than Ukrainian and have killed hundreds of thousands of Polish, Hungarians, Russians, and even Jews. “We’re not asking for nuclear weapons to be given to us,” he claimed yet he has been raising the nuclear argument before Russia crossed the border. Last week, Zelensky implied that obtaining nuclear weapons should be provided if his country couldn’t join NATO. “Either Ukraine has nuclear weapons, which will serve as its protection, or it must be part of some kind of alliance.” There is no mistake about Zelensky. The Ukrainian people had better rise up against this modern-day Hitler who still harbors ethnic cleansing. Putin warned that this would be a very “dangerous provocation.” Zelensky is an evil, greedy person who only thinks about destroying Russia, just as the Ukrainians were doing for Hitler. Putin further added: “I can say right away that Russia will not allow this to happen under any circumstances.” Zelensky claimed his Victory Plan was not nuclear, just the total destruction of Russia. Any Western leader who gives anything to Ukraine is an absolute traitor to his people. This will end in World War III, the West WILL LOSE, and the world’s financial capital will move to Beijing. Anyone who supports Zelensky should be dragged out of office ASAP.

Because the “America First” crowd was dead wrong in WW2. But they were dead right in WW1. America (and Europe) would have been much better off if Wilson had resisted the pressure to enter the war. So what to do? Perhaps we should be - at least initially - guided by: America goes not abroad, in search of monsters to destroy.

The Ukrainian people had better rise up against this modern-day Hitler who still harbors ethnic cleansing. Putin warned that this would be a very “dangerous provocation.” Zelensky is an evil, greedy person who only thinks about destroying Russia, just as the Ukrainians were doing for Hitler. Putin further added: “I can say right away that Russia will not allow this to happen under any circumstances.” Zelensky claimed his Victory Plan was not nuclear, just the total destruction of Russia. Any Western leader who gives anything to Ukraine is an absolute traitor to his people. This will end in World War III, the West WILL LOSE, and the world’s financial capital will move to Beijing.

Because the “America First” crowd was dead wrong in WW2. But they were dead right in WW1. America (and Europe) would have been much better off if Wilson had resisted the pressure to enter the war. So what to do? Perhaps we should be - at least initially - guided by: America goes not abroad, in search of monsters to destroy.

There are numerous foreign soldiers returning who are totally disgusted by what they have witnessed in Ukraine. One reported that they simply shot all the Russian soldiers they captured. Nobody will tell the truth because as long as they hate Russia, then Russia’s enemy is the West’s friend. The Ukrainian Neo-Nazis have been the most ruthless people I have ever encountered in history. Add to that, Ukraine is the most corrupt country in Europe even declared by the IMF. In fact, they may be the most corrupt in the world. Zelensky has called on NATO to use nuclear weapons to destroy Russia. This is the typical ethnic hatred that has always consumed Ukraine. They were the neo-Naris who joined Hitler because they were still practicing ethnic cleansing. They hate anyone other than Ukrainian and have killed hundreds of thousands of Polish, Hungarians, Russians, and even Jews. “We’re not asking for nuclear weapons to be given to us,” he claimed yet he has been raising the nuclear argument before Russia crossed the border. Last week, Zelensky implied that obtaining nuclear weapons should be provided if his country couldn’t join NATO. “Either Ukraine has nuclear weapons, which will serve as its protection, or it must be part of some kind of alliance.” There is no mistake about Zelensky. The Ukrainian people had better rise up against this modern-day Hitler who still harbors ethnic cleansing. Putin warned that this would be a very “dangerous provocation.” Zelensky is an evil, greedy person who only thinks about destroying Russia, just as the Ukrainians were doing for Hitler.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Zelensky has called on NATO to use nuclear weapons to destroy Russia. This is the typical ethnic hatred that has always consumed Ukraine. They were the neo-Naris who joined Hitler because they were still practicing ethnic cleansing. They hate anyone other than Ukrainian and have killed hundreds of thousands of Polish, Hungarians, Russians, and even Jews. “We’re not asking for nuclear weapons to be given to us,” he claimed yet he has been raising the nuclear argument before Russia crossed the border. Last week, Zelensky implied that obtaining nuclear weapons should be provided if his country couldn’t join NATO. “Either Ukraine has nuclear weapons, which will serve as its protection, or it must be part of some kind of alliance.” There is no mistake about Zelensky. The Ukrainian people had better rise up against this modern-day Hitler who still harbors ethnic cleansing. Putin warned that this would be a very “dangerous provocation.” Zelensky is an evil, greedy person who only thinks about destroying Russia, just as the Ukrainians were doing for Hitler. Putin further added: “I can say right away that Russia will not allow this to happen under any circumstances.” Zelensky claimed his Victory Plan was not nuclear, just the total destruction of Russia. Any Western leader who gives anything to Ukraine is an absolute traitor to his people. This will end in World War III, the West WILL LOSE, and the world’s financial capital will move to Beijing. Anyone who supports Zelensky should be dragged out of office ASAP.

Because the “America First” crowd was dead wrong in WW2. But they were dead right in WW1. America (and Europe) would have been much better off if Wilson had resisted the pressure to enter the war. So what to do? Perhaps we should be - at least initially - guided by: America goes not abroad, in search of monsters to destroy.

Title: ‘Most ferocious dictatorship’: Kamala described as ‘an infernal monster who obeys Satan’
URL: https://www.wnd.com/2024/10/most-ferocious-dictatorship-kamala-described-as-an-infernal-monster-who-obeys-satan/
Time Published: 2024-10-27T16:26:59Z
Description: 'There can be no question: voting for Kamala Harris is morally inadmissible and constitutes a very grave sin. Nor is it morally possible to abstain, because in this war declaring oneself neutral means allying oneself with the enemy'
