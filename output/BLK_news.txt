© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy Versant, Comcast’s corporate cable channel spinoff, signed a lease over the summer for a temporary home across 164,545 square feet at the former New York Times building at 229 West 43rd Street, according to Savills’ third-quarter Manhattan office leasing report. The move, which occurred in August, marked a major milestone for MSNBC, which moved out of its headquarters and studios at NBC’s iconic 30 Rockefeller Plaza. Adweek cited a memo to the company’s staff from Jeff Mayzurk, Versant’s president of operations and technology, saying that the new location, known internally at Versant as “summer camp,” was chosen “due to its studio and production space and its central location.” Despite this, Versant considers the move temporary, and is reportedly still searching for a permanent location. The length of the lease and the asking rent were unclear, as was the reason the new location will only be temporary. When the Martha Graham Dance Company moved to neighboring 1501 Broadway in May of this year, Crain’s New York Business reported that asking rents in that building started at $58 per square foot. It is unclear who the brokers were for the Versant lease, although JLL is the building’s leasing team, according to the building’s website. The owner of the building’s office portion is Columbia Property Trust. The building’s first four floors and two below-grade ones are retail-oriented and separately owned, having been purchased in August 2025 by Forum at Times Square for just $28 million, according to Crain’s New York Business. Ironically, an adviser on that deal, Jay Miller of BayBridge Real Estate Capital, told Crain’s at the time that the location’s appeal was enhanced by the possibility of a proposed casino right across the street. Those hopes were dashed two weeks ago, as CO previously reported. The building – which occupies 682,843 square feet, according to Property Shark – served as the home of The New York Times from 1913 to 2007. It received a landmark designation in 2001, and underwent an extensive renovation around 2011. CO reported in 2022 that BuzzFeed, seeking to cut its office footprint, relocated to 107,000 square feet in the building that it planned to share with its new parent company, Complex Networks. Both companies have since relocated again, with Buzzfeed shrinking its footprint further to 42,210 square feet at 50 West 23rd Street. Columbia Property Trust, Versant Media and JLL did not immediately respond to requests for information. Larry Getlen can be reached at lgetlen@commercialobserver.com.

© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy BlackRock has expanded its New York City headquarters to more than 1.2 million square feet. The asset management company has subleased an additional 193,573 square feet at Related Companies’ 50 Hudson Yards, according to a third-quarter office report from Savills. The sublandlord was Meta, which announced it was looking to cut about 250,000 square feet from its 1.2 million-square-foot office footprint at the Hudson Yards tower in December 2022. The expansion comes after BlackRock added more than 50,000 square feet to its headquarters at 50 Hudson Yards in July 2024, which brought its total footprint at the property to roughly 1.05 million square feet, as Commercial Observer previously reported. Now, following the latest expansion, BlackRock will boast roughly 1.24 million square feet of office space across more than 15 floors at the 77-story tower. The terms of the deal were unclear, but when 50 Hudson Yards opened in 2022, asking rents ranged between $175 and $240 per square foot. During the second quarter of this year, office rents in Hudson Yards averaged $153.52 per square foot, according to a report from Avison Young. JLL‘s Peter Riguardi, Matthew Astrachan, Joseph Messina and Hannah Bernstein brokered the deal. BlackRock declined to comment, while spokespeople for Related and JLL — which has represented BlackRock in past deals — did not immediately respond to requests for comment. BlackRock signed its original lease at 50 Hudson Yards in 2016 for 20 years, with an initial commitment to occupy 850,000 square feet at the property, as CO previously reported. The asset management company has now far exceeded that commitment, joining the ranks of several high-profile tenants at the 2.9 million-square-foot office building. Those tenants include Meta, which leases space across 19 floors of the tower, and Truist Financial, which signed a deal for 100,000 square feet at the property in September 2022.

If you're new here, please click here to get my FREE 57-page investment banking recruiting guide - plus, get weekly updates so that you can break into investment banking. Thanks for visiting! If you’ve searched online for asset management interview questions, you’ve probably walked away disappointed. Yes, there are bits and pieces of information, but most “lists” are quite generic and gloss over detailed questions. Asset management interviews are like the “Generalist Olympics” because you need to know about a huge range of topics: The standard fit/behavioral questions, the firm’s investment strategies, economics and trade policy, valuation, equities and fixed income, general market knowledge, portfolio management, and more. The good news is that you don’t necessarily need to know a lot about each topic. The bad news is that it’s challenging to prepare because there’s no centralized place to learn about everything, and it’s much harder to “memorize” answers: One quick note before we begin: “Asset management” in this context refers to front-office work at firms such as Fidelity, Wellington, T. Rowe Price, and PIMCO. This means that you’ll analyze companies and entire sectors and construct portfolios for clients. “Asset management” does NOT mean wealth management, hedge funds, asset/liability management, or the commercial real estate kind of asset management (i.e., managing existing properties that your firm has acquired). Your clients could be either institutions or very-high-net-worth (VHNW) / ultra-high-net-worth (UHNW) individuals. But they should not be retail investors with small amounts to invest because that’s more like wealth management. Asset management firms want candidates with great academic qualifications (university name, GPA, etc.), solid internship experience in related fields (equity research, hedge funds, etc.), and the ability to work in a team and generate new investment ideas while managing risk. But there are very few entry-level openings each year (perhaps in the low hundreds or less), and the process is unstructured. You’ll go through the usual HireVue and phone/video interviews and then complete in-person final rounds, but there’s less of a strict timeline than in fields like investment banking. This means you need to prepare far in advance, as you won’t know the exact timing of each step in the process. The following topics are most important in AM interviews: Q: Tell me about yourself / walk me through your resume. A: See our guide and examples for the “Walk me through your resume” question and the article on how to walk through your resume in buy-side interviews. To give this more of an AM spin, talk about classes, student clubs, internships that are related to the markets and investing, and how working at this firm will let you focus on a certain strategy, sector, or geography you like. Focusing on team activities also helps. Q: Why asset management? A: You’ve always liked getting a big-picture view of the market and constructing entire portfolios based on individual companies and asset classes. You also like explaining your findings and rationale and understanding clients’ concerns, so AM is perfect since it combines client work and investment analysis. Avoid day trading references; focus on using classes, books, student clubs/activities, and relevant internships to explain your interest. Q: Why our firm/group? A: As always, you need to research the group beforehand, find a few “fact sheets” about their offerings, and link these into your answer (examples for T. Rowe Price): “I’m interested in your Dividend Growth Fund because it’s the perfect mix of ‘value’ and ‘growth’ investing. I focused on value in my previous hedge fund internships, but it doesn’t perform well in all market environments; this strategy is more robust and lets us shift the portfolio in changing markets and apply traditional value screens to high-growth companies.” Q: What are your strengths and weaknesses? A: There’s a full guide to this one. For strengths, you can cite points such as technical/analytical skills, communication ability, teamwork, and the ability to make quick decisions in response to market events. For weaknesses, you can discuss points like hesitating to give harsh feedback to teammates, sometimes not pushing back on inappropriate requests, or presenting too many options to clients. These questions test whether you can do the job: Q: How would you determine the optimal asset allocation for a client? A: You’d start by asking questions about their profile first: What their existing portfolio looks like, how much they have to invest, their liquidity requirements, their risk tolerance, any investment restrictions, and how much they need to live on (individuals) or fund their required obligations (e.g., pensions). Once you have gathered this information, you would start with the key constraints and then construct a portfolio to “bridge the gap” between what they currently have and what they should ideally have. For example, if a pension fund needs to make $50 million per year in employee benefit payments, you’d recommend a mix of bonds and dividend-paying stocks that would yield annual payments comfortably above that amount. After that, you would then assess the fund’s tolerated drawdowns and allocate more to bonds or stocks depending on whether it should accept more or less risk. Alternative assets, such as real estate and private equity/hedge funds, might also be allowed, but it depends on the client type. Q: Suppose that you are building a portfolio with allocations to many different asset classes. How would it be different if you were working at a pension fund vs. a university endowment? A: Both are subject to specific liquidity requirements and may have restrictions on their allowed strategies, securities, etc. The key difference is that endowments often plan longer-term and have a higher risk tolerance because they don’t need to make specific annual payments to retired employees; they simply need to grow their university’s assets over many decades. So, you might lean toward a more traditional stock/bond mix for a pension fund, but would be more likely to consider alternatives (real estate, PE/HF investments, etc.) for an endowment, along with a higher allocation to riskier assets. Q: A client’s portfolio just fell by 20% in the most recent quarter, and he is very upset with your firm. What would you do to calm him down? A: First, you’d listen to his concerns and spend time asking follow-up questions about his feelings, what he expected vs. what happened, and how this affects his real life. Then, you’d try to reframe the losses in a way that speaks to their concerns and mindset. This varies by client type and outlook, but a few examples include: Q: What is your investment philosophy, and how does it match ours? A: This one varies by candidate and fund, but here’s an example answer: “I understand that your fund focuses on ‘value with a macro overlay,’ so you invest in ~80% value stocks and then use other securities, such as precious metals ETFs, to hedge macro risk. I focused on value investing in emerging markets in my last role, which is quite similar because macro factors make an outsized impact there. Issues like a country’s borrowings in local currency vs. USD, its current account surplus/deficit, and commodity prices make a huge impact because many EM companies – even ‘value’ ones – are tied to exports and commodity prices. So, with every single investment recommendation I made, I always had to think about how to hedge the macro risk via derivatives and other investments.” Q: How do you manage risk in your portfolios? A: Entire books have been written about this topic, but one simple approach is to outline the key risk categories, such as currencies, interest rates, market, liquidity, and credit, and assign a “rating” for each one to each holding in your portfolio. You could then take a weighted average of these, see what the totals look like in each category, and rebalance accordingly. For example, maybe one client portfolio is overly exposed to interest-rate risk because of its allocation to long-term government bonds, but could afford to take more market risk; you might reallocate from bonds to stocks to get a more appropriate allocation. These questions are closer to the ones in investment banking interviews. But the interviewers will not go into nearly as much depth since accounting and valuation are just two of many possible topics: Q: Explain how the 3 financial statements link together. A: This is a classic question that is answered in the IB interview question article in Category #4. In short, the Net Income at the bottom of the Income Statement acts as the first line of the Cash Flow Statement. Adjust this for non-cash income and expenses, reflect the Change in Working Capital, and then record cash inflows and outflows from investing and financing activities. Cash at the bottom of the CFS equals the Beginning Cash in the period plus all these changes (Cash Flow from Operations, Investing, and Financing), and this becomes the ending Cash number on the Balance Sheet. Link the non-cash adjustments to their corresponding BS line items, make Net Income flow into Equity, and link the CFI and CFF line items to their corresponding Balance Sheet lines. Q: Walk me through how to move from EBITDA to FCF and explain how FCF is used in valuations. A: We have a whole tutorial on EBITDA to FCF, so see that for the details. In short, FCF = EBITDA – Net Interest Expense – Taxes +/- Other Non-Cash Adjustments +/- Change in Working Capital – CapEx. The tricky part is that this specific “type” of FCF is rarely used in valuations because it’s more of a credit or financial statement analysis metric. You tend to use Unlevered Free Cash Flow in a DCF because it ignores capital structure; UFCF excludes the Net Interest Expense and bases the Taxes on EBIT rather than Pre-Tax Income. Q: Explain the relationship between valuation multiples and a DCF model, and when you might rely more on one or the other. A: Unsurprisingly, we have another tutorial on valuation multiples. Essentially, they’re a “condensed” form of the DCF that expresses similar information (cash flow, future growth rates, and risk) but in a single number rather than an entire analysis. Common examples are Enterprise Value / Revenue, Enterprise Value / EBITDA, and P / E or Equity Value / Net Income. Valuation multiples are normally supporting tools in a full company analysis; they are shorter and easier than detailed projections, but also less meaningful. However, if a DCF is not feasible because the company is too speculative, does not yet generate revenue, or has other major issues, you might rely more on multiples. Q: Explain the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and how it affects valuations. A: See our tutorial on the WACC formula. This CAPM model says that a company’s Equity, Debt, and Preferred Stock have “expected” or “required” rates of return, and you can estimate the overall Discount Rate by taking a weighted average of these rates. You then use this Discount Rate in a DCF model to value the company based on its future cash flows. When the required rate of return is higher, the company’s implied value is lower (and vice versa). Q: Why does a DCF for individual companies matter if your job is to construct portfolios of 50 – 100 assets for clients? A: Single-company DCFs matter less in this context, but they can still be helpful for “sanity checking” the valuations in different sectors. For example, if Big Tech is overvalued, DCF models for all companies in the sector will probably point to similar results. So, you can often run quick analyses that give you a rough idea of valuation levels based on representative companies in the sector. And yes, you could use simple EBITDA or P / E multiples as well, but the DCF often gives you a more accurate reading (if executed correctly). In nearly all AM interviews, the interviewer will ask you about metrics such as the S&P 500 closing price and the 10-year government bond yield to assess how closely you follow the markets. However, they will also expect you to have a view on where the markets are headed. To stay up to date, it helps to read the weekly “Market Commentary” updates from various banks and AM firms: BlackRock | T. Rowe Price | Barclays | JPM | Citi Q: What’s the S&P 500 at? What about the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield and the prices of oil and gold? A: You can view all of these on the homepage of the WSJ each day, even without a subscription. If you’re in Europe or Asia, substitute in the major indices in your market, such as the FTSE 100 or the Nikkei and Shanghai Composite. Q: Where are the equity markets headed? Why? A: There is no “best” or universal answer for this one, and also no way to judge whether your answer is correct. But “better” answers tend to have more data supporting them, while “worse” answers are based on vibes rather than numbers: “I expect the overall U.S. market, represented by the S&P 500, to remain stagnant over the next year (vs. a ~14% YTD increase) because the companies with the largest weightings in it are valued very richly, and once some of the AI hype moderates, their share prices may not perform as well. It’s already at a 24x forward P/E vs. 25- and 10-year averages of 20x. Political instability, such as the government shutdown, and the inability to rein in the deficit will also weigh down stock prices. International markets, which are up roughly ~25% YTD based on VTIAX, should continue to outperform over the next year, perhaps in the 10 – 20% range, due to the falling USD and much lower P/E multiples in the ~15x range. Several non-U.S. developed markets have also hinted at fiscal stimulus, which could boost asset prices as well.” Q: Which sectors will benefit the most and be hurt the most by rising inflation? A: The most vulnerable sectors are ones with low margins that cannot easily pass on price increases to their customers – something like low-cost retailers might count (yes, they can increase prices, but their customers are very price-sensitive). Anything that is more defensive, viewed as a “necessity,” or has prices that are locked to inflation in some way, will tend to do better. Examples might include certain healthcare or utilities companies or consumer staples. In this category, bond questions are much more likely than currency and commodity questions: Q: Explain the yield to maturity (YTM) and duration of a bond and how you use them in portfolio management. A: The Yield to Maturity (YTM) is the annualized return an investor will receive if they buy a bond at its current market price and hold it until maturity, assuming the company makes all the required payments, and the investor reinvests the interest payments at the same rate as the overall return. Duration is the first derivative of the bond’s price with respect to the YTM, so it tells you how sensitive a bond’s price is to changes in interest rates or “prevailing yields on similar bonds.” Portfolio managers use the YTM to measure their potential annualized returns and duration to manage interest-rate risk; they want the weighted-average duration of their entire bond portfolio to be in a certain range so that they’re not caught flat-footed if interest rates suddenly change. Q: Is a U.S. Treasury truly “risk-free?” If not, what are the risks, and how could you hedge against them? A: No. It’s free of default risk, but it still has interest-rate, currency, and inflation risk. For example, if overall interest rates increase, pushing up the yields on similar UST, the market value of any UST you own will decrease, and you will lose money if you sell them before maturity. If you convert from another currency into USD to buy these bonds, the FX rate could change and reduce the amount you earn back upon sale or maturity. And inflation risk means that if inflation runs above the YTM of the bond, you could also lose money in real terms, even if you receive all the interest payments and earn back the nominal amount you invested. Q: Recently, the Fed cut interest rates, but rates on 30-year mortgages increased. How is that possible? Shouldn’t they always follow the benchmark rate? A: The Fed only controls short-term interest rates – but mortgages are typically priced based on longer-term benchmarks, such as 10-year Treasuries. Even if short-term interest rates fall, long-term bond yields could rise if the market prices in higher political, economic, or inflation risk, which is likely what happened here. Also, mortgages have prepayment and credit default risk, so one of these may have increased despite the rate cut. Q: Compare and contrast gold and silver as assets. A: Both gold and silver are precious metals often used in the “defensive” part of portfolios. They both act as inflation hedges and provide downside protection in market crashes, making them particularly useful when interest rates are currently low but inflation expectations are rising. However, silver tends to be more volatile than gold and fluctuates more in different economics cycles, as it also has significant industrial uses, such as in EVs and smartphones. Most investors aim to maintain a specific gold/silver ratio over time. Q: Consider the USD/EUR exchange rate. Suppose that the ECB cuts interest rates at a faster rate than the Fed, the major EU member states report falling trade surpluses with the U.S., and European GDP growth comes in below expectations. Despite all this, the EUR *rises* against the USD. Why? A: Dozens of factors influence FX rates, but a currency tends to strengthen when yields on government bonds priced in that currency increase, when the country runs a trade surplus, and when economic growth exceeds expectations. So, in this scenario, we would expect the EUR to fall against the USD since it’s the opposite in each case. The answer probably lies in other factors not mentioned here: For example, maybe on-again-off-again/confusing tariffs or geopolitical uncertainty has reduced confidence in the USD, and investors have flocked to the EUR as a safe(r) haven. Many of these questions do not have “answers” – they’re designed to spur a discussion between you and the interviewer. You could say almost anything if you back it up with solid reasoning, so the goal is to assess how deep you can go based on your knowledge. Q: How will tariffs impact the global economy? A: We published a whole article about this one back in April, so you can start there. In short, tariffs are an additional corporate tax on foreign-sourced parts, supplies, and raw materials, so they tend to be inflationary if companies pass them on 1:1 to customers (which may or may not happen – it depends on their margins and competition). Theoretically, tariffs are supposed to encourage more domestic production, but the real-life results have been mixed. So, the best answer is that tariffs are “case by case,” and they’ll boost some sectors (e.g., domestic auto companies) while hurting others (luxury retailers, spirits companies, etc.). They turn the economy into more of a “government picks the winners and losers” game. Q: How will AI and automation affect the economy? A: AI and automation tools tend to reduce labor costs, but they increase demand for the required inputs, such as electricity and rare-earth/other metals. So, like tariffs, this one is case-by-case based on the labor costs in each industry, how much AI will shift those costs, and whether the industry is a “supplier” or “consumer.” For example, mining companies could benefit greatly because AI demand could boost prices for metals like aluminum, silicon, and copper (all used in chips), as it takes a long time for production to catch up. Many “white-collar” industries, such as law firms, Big 4 accounting firms, and banks, will likely see falling labor costs as teams can do more with less (so, they may be able to maintain or expand their margins even as they grow). On the other hand, sectors like nursing facilities may not be affected much because nurses are very difficult to “replace” or even “augment” with current AI tools. Q: The demographics in most developed countries are awful, as no one is having kids anymore. How will this affect GDP growth and asset prices? A: Falling populations due to low birth rates negatively impact GDP growth because it’s much harder to grow an economy when the population is falling (of course, improved automation could change this). Also, social welfare systems such as Social Security and Medicare in the U.S. become increasingly difficult to maintain since the burden falls disproportionately on younger workers. Higher taxes to fund these systems, plus benefit cuts to keep them solvent, both translate into reduced consumer spending, which puts more downward pressure on GDP. That said, asset prices will not necessarily fall because they depend on the money supply and fiscal and monetary factors as well. So, if the government runs huge deficits and prints money to fund these social welfare systems and prop up consumer spending, asset prices could keep inflating, even if the overall economy is poor. We’ve covered stock pitches extensively, including some of the differences in long-only roles. The short version is that you should prepare at least one “Long” pitch by following the guide, but it doesn’t have to be for a specific stock. If you’re interviewing for a role that’s more “big picture,” you could also pitch an ETF focused on a specific industry, geography, or company type. Rather than doing exhaustive research and creating a detailed model, focus on quick pitches that you can explain in 30 – 60 seconds. There’s a good “investor presentation” example for Tema Global Royalties ETF here. You could use this to extract and mention these points in your pitch: Finally, case studies outside of stock pitches are not that likely unless you complete a U.K.-style assessment center. If you do, expect some type of group exercise that involves portfolio construction or selecting Fund A vs. Fund B for your portfolio. This article turned out to be far longer than I expected because the breadth of topics in these interviews is so wide. Unfortunately, I don’t think there is a quick/straightforward preparation plan. You must read a lot about the economy, markets, trade, and geopolitics, and there is no real shortcut to understanding everything. If I had to suggest a specific plan, I’d recommend spending one day on each “preparable topic” above (fit/behavioral questions, portfolio/client management, accounting/valuation, equities, FICC, and your stock pitch). You should be able to do a decent job reviewing each one and outlining answers to common questions in this time frame. Don’t spend more than a day coming up with your stock pitch; maybe even limit it to a few hours to prevent an overly complex pitch. With everything in the other categories (“General Market Knowledge” and “Economics, Trade, and Geopolitics”), the only answer is to continuously read sources like the WSJ and FT. It may be boring, but winning the “Generalist Olympics” of asset management interviews is sort of like winning the real Olympics: A ton of repetition over long periods and more than a little luck.

What would you do to calm him down? A true asset management aficionado would say the benchmark went down by 40% and we performed top quartile amongst peers with lower volatility. I thought about adding something like that that, but 40% seemed extreme, even for a pessimist like me. Also, even though it’s true that AM returns are benchmarked against indices, I’m not sure an upset client really wants to hear that (I realize some articles and advice may suggest this). I think it’s more useful to spin it as “This will be positive in the long run” rather than “This isn’t that bad vs. everyone else.” Your email address will not be published.

Title: World of Warcraft: Midnight deep dive reveals a continent-hopping questline as part of its main campaign, a cosy 'Arcantina' hub, and the release date of player housing's early access

At home in time for the holidays. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. World of Warcraft: Midnight just received a massive deep dive on its official channels. It's mostly an assemblage of information already out there, such as the new Demon Hunter Spec, the game's new zones, the transmog updates, and the upcoming Prey feature—which as a difficulty sicko with precious few mates that have raid-accessible schedules? I'm very excited about. One of the more interesting tidbits lies in its Campaign. While Midnight's first zone will be the Eversong Woods, Blizzard's shaking things up with the way the rest of the expansion's story will play out. Once you've tied things up near Silvermoon, you'll have your choice of Harandar, Zul'Aman, or—get this—a romp throughout older zones. Arator’s Journey will see you following Arator on his journey (no shockers there), visiting locations like Hope's Chapel, the Scarlet Monastery, and culminating at Blackrock Mountain. When you've completed both zone stories and this questline, you'll be funnelled to the Voidstorm to throw down with Xal'atath's forces directly. The rest of the deep dive's info has mostly been released by Blizzard on official channels before, but there are two notable exceptions. The first of which is the Arcantina, a cross-faction social hub that aims to be a place where players can chill out—and also pick up quests from seasonal NPCs. The second is that Player Housing, the long-awaited feature that Blizzard seems to basically be nailing thus far, will officially be releasing in early access on December 2—though you'll have to pre-purchase Midnight first. We also got to find out a little more about how players will be getting decor. The answer being, "through basically everything". Crafting, achievements, vendors, events, you name it. What's more, anything that's accolade-related—such as beating a raid—will be applied retroactively to your player's account. All in all, Midnight's shaping up to be real compelling. Transmog updates, base UI improvements, opt-in difficult world content where a bad guy can ambush you at any time, and the most important endgame of all: Making a cute little house to put all your trash in. Based on what I've seen of other games, WoW's housing features are going to be a phenomenal boon to the 20-year old MMO's community.

Title: The Future of Financial Settlement Isn't Faster, It's Fundamentally Different

You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. The financial industry loves to talk about speed. Real-time payments. Instant settlement. Same-day ACH. But making a horse-drawn carriage go faster doesn't turn it into a car. The problem with traditional financial settlement is that it was built for a world that no longer exists. Traditional financial infrastructure is a patchwork of batch processing systems, correspondent banking relationships and siloed databases that were state-of-the-art when telex machines roamed the earth. Even today's "real-time" payment rails are largely smoke and mirrors. They’re just faster messages layered on top of the same 1970’s architecture. They still require reconciliation, suffer from counterparty risk and depend on business hours in specific time zones. This is a design problem. Consider what actually happens when a fintech promises "instant" international transfers. Behind the scenes, they're pre-funding accounts, managing float across multiple jurisdictions and hoping their reconciliation catches any discrepancies before month-end. The customer sees speed, but the company shoulders massive operational complexity and working capital requirements. Settlement friction negatively impacts every business that moves money. An e-commerce platform waiting T+2 for card settlements ties up working capital that could fund inventory. A logistics company managing international suppliers juggles dozens of banking relationships just to pay invoices. Even sophisticated enterprises with treasury management systems spend millions annually on the plumbing that moves value between entities. This isn't sustainable in a world where digital commerce happens 24/7, supply chains span continents and customers expect Amazon-like efficiency from every interaction. Why do we have same-day delivery on a weekend for packages but not financial transfers? Public blockchain infrastructure offers something that is worlds apart from traditional financial infrastructure: a shared, programmable settlement layer that operates continuously, transparently and without intermediaries. Value can move incredibly fast through a global economy built on blockchain rails. When BlackRock tokenized its BUIDL money market fund, it showed a recognition that 24/7 trading, near-instant settlement and programmable compliance create genuine operational advantages. When companies issue tokenized shares, they create a more efficient, transparent and accessible capital market infrastructure. These new financial primitives create entirely new markets. Let’s be clear that it’s not just financial services that are being revamped through better payment rails. The real unlock provided by smart contracts is that they can automate complex multi-party workflows that today require armies of back-office staff. A manufacturer can pay suppliers automatically when IoT sensors confirm delivery and quality checks. Real estate transactions can settle atomically, with payment, title transfer and regulatory filings happening simultaneously. Insurance claims can trigger instant payouts when parametric conditions are met. The point, again, is that blockchain doesn't just digitize traditional finance or provide increased speed. Different rails mean entirely new business models are possible. Every major bank is already tokenizing assets on Ethereum. Circle moves billions in USDC daily. PayPal's stablecoin runs on public blockchains. Why are any enterprises still debating whether this is "real?" They're missing the plot. While traditional companies optimize their SWIFT messages and patch their core banking systems, an entire parallel financial system has emerged. The gig economy worker in Manila doesn't know or care that her USDC payment bypassed the correspondent banking network; she cares about whether the money arrived instantly, so that she can use it immediately to pay rent, buy groceries or send some home to her family, all without fees eating away at her paycheck. The thing about infrastructure revolutions is that they don't announce themselves. In five years, "we still use ACH" will be the new "we still host our own servers in-house." It’s technically possible, unnecessarily expensive, and a clear signal you've fallen behind. The payment rails upgrade has happened. It just hasn't been evenly distributed yet.

Title: Let’s talk about ARR
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/10/01/lets-talk-about-arr/
Time Published: 2025-10-01T11:11:06Z
Full Content:
Allie Garfinkle is a senior finance reporter for Fortune, covering venture capital and startups. She authors Term Sheet, Fortune’s weekday dealmaking newsletter. It’s likely safe to say—creative accounting’s been around for as long as accounting itself. In 1494, for example, mathematician and ‘father of modern accounting’ Luca Pacioli wrote of Venetian merchants willfully rendering their ledgers illegible. In the Gilded Age, inflating assets and understating liabilities was standard practice across a booming system. And who can forget the “channel stuffing” of the 2000s? And, because some things are eternal, this era naturally has its own creative accounting practices, which I published a feature on this past weekend. Right now, some of the most clear shenanigans are going on around ARR, or “annual recurring revenue.” “The problem is that so much of this is essentially vibe revenue,” one VC told me. “It’s not Google signing a data center contract. That’s real shit. Some startup that’s using your product temporarily? That’s really not revenue.” ARR was a favorite metric of VCs throughout the software-as-a-service (SaaS) era, widely accepted as a trusted proxy for a stable and growing startup. Now, founders are trying to apply ARR to the AI boom—and it doesn’t fit. These days, founders are counting pilots, one-time deals, or unactivated contracts as recurring revenue, six VCs told Fortune. The push comes from somewhere very human, from a desire to keep up with the competition. “There is all this pressure from companies like Decagon, Cursor, and Cognition that are just crushing it,” said another VC. “There’s so much pressure to be the company that went from zero to $100 million in X days.” At the center of all this is an essential truth: That we’re going to need to evolve metrics with AI, and how AI companies actually work. And in the meantime, it’s worth saying: Creative accounting has been around as long as businesses were counting, but that doesn’t mean it’s good practice. That doesn’t mean it’s safe or healthy for the system. And it doesn’t mean there won’t be consequences for some down the line. Read the whole story here.

More Info Global investment firm KKR has acquired a minority stake in ADNOC Gas Pipeline Assets LLC, the gas pipeline network of Abu Dhabi’s national oil company, in a move signaling growing investor confidence in infrastructure opportunities in the oil and gas-rich Middle East. The new investment, the value of which was not disclosed, strengthens KKR’s long-term strategic partnership with the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), and reflects the firm’s confidence in Abu Dhabi’s competitiveness as a premier global investment destination, the private equity giant said on Wednesday. The gas pipeline network connects ADNOC’s upstream assets to local off-takers in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Pipeline ownership and operational management remain with ADNOC. The deal for a minority stake in ADNOC’s gas pipelines assets follows the first such transaction in the Middle East, when KKR bought in 2019 a minority stake in ADNOC’s oil pipelines business. The 2019 acquisition of 40% in ADNOC Oil Pipelines by KKR and BlackRock was the first-ever investment of foreign asset managers in infrastructure of a state-owned energy firm in the Gulf. Last year, KKR and BlackRock sold the 40% stake in ADNOC Oil Pipelines LLC to Abu Dhabi-based alternative investment manager Lunate. Commenting on the deal for ADNOC’s gas pipeline infrastructure, General David Petraeus, chairman of KKR Middle East, said today that “This investment reflects KKR’s commitment to expand partnerships and investment across the Middle East. The region’s strong fundamentals, bold vision, and focused leadership offer increasingly attractive opportunities for global investors.” Earlier this year, Saudi Arabia’s oil giant Aramco signed an $11 billion lease and leaseback deal involving its Jafurah gas processing facilities with a consortium of international investors, led by funds managed by Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), a part of BlackRock. Jafurah, the largest non-associated gas development in Saudi Arabia, is a key part of Aramco’s plans to increase gas production capacity by 60% between 2021 and 2030, to meet rising demand.

Title: Top 2025 Synthetic Dollar Protocols to Earn High Yield in Crypto (Naina Rajgopalan)
URL: https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/29486/top-2025-synthetic-dollar-protocols-to-earn-high-yield-in-crypto
Time Published: 2025-10-01T07:35:13Z
Full Content:
Synthetic dollars have become a practical bridge between “stablecoin-like” price stability and market-rate yields, packaging professional hedging and cash-equivalent income into assets that behave like dollars onchain. This article explains the core concepts and profiles three leading projects: Falcon Finance (USDf), Ethena (USDe), and Elixir (deUSD), with a special focus on how they balance stability, yield, collateral breadth, and operational risk to deliver competitive APY. Before moving to the overview of synthetic dollar projects, it is worth to unpack some concepts, core to understanding how these protocols work. First, what is a synthetic dollar? It is a crypto-native asset engineered to hold a $1 value, typically via overcollateralization and delta-neutral hedging of crypto collateral (or other instruments), and generate yield (the net return paid to all synthetic dollar holders), although yield is not universal or guaranteed. Synthetic dollar protocols are applications that allow to mint, stake and perform other operations with synthetic dollars, usually in an automatic manner. Most 2025 synthetic dollar designs achieve a stable yield stream by adopting certain yield-generation strategies, in particular pairing spot collateral with delta-neutral hedges, e.g., short perpetual futures, so the portfolio’s net exposure to the underlying assets is close to zero. There can be additional strategies, such as staking, cross-exchange arbitrage and DeFi liquidity provisioning. Furthermore, every synthetic dollar protocol employs a certain mechanism of collateralization and acceptance. Some protocols accept a narrow set of blue-chip cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.), while others aim to accept many crypto assets and even real-world assets (RWAs). In 2025, synthetic dollar protocols also incorporate RWA rails in different forms, such as tokenized money-market funds or U.S. treasuries (T-bills), e.g., BlackRock BUIDL and Superstate USTB. Tokenized assets are used either as direct backing (treasury-backed stables) or as yield components alongside delta-neutral positions. Synthetic dollars have gained increasing popularity in 2025. According to Coingecko, the sector’s market cap more than doubled throughout the year, growing from about $6 billion to more than $16 billion by early September 2025. In one of the articles, Financial Times noted how yields compressed from the early burst of over 60% annualized to low single digits as competition crowded the basis trades, making synthetic dollar protocols a broad marketplace. At the same time, protocol design diversified: ● Some protocols added treasury-backed lines (e.g., Falcon Finance’s USTB or Ethena’s USDtb) for traditional cash management, while keeping synthetic dollars themselves (USDf, USDe, deUSD) for crypto-native yield. ● Projects like Falcon Finance offered a multi-strategy, collateral-agnostic approach aiming for steadier yields through different market regimes and a pathway to a broader collateral base (including RWAs). ● At the same time, Elixir positioned its deUSD token as “order-book infrastructure” and RWA rails, combining stETH-based hedges with sUSDS-linked treasury yields. Design and goal. The second most capitalized synthetic dollar protocol (per Coingecko), Falcon Finance manages USDf, an overcollateralized synthetic dollar, and sUSDf as the yield-bearing token. While the project offers one of the highest yield rates, its main goal is to become a universal collateralization layer: many crypto assets, along with RWA, qualify today, and more RWAs (stocks, real estate and more) are about to be added in the future. Collateral. Assets accepted by Falcon Finance as collateral for minting USDf range from major stablecoins (USDT, USDC, DAI, USDS) to blue-chips and altcoins (BTC/WBTC, ETH, SOL, XRP, TRX, TON, AVAX, SEI, etc.), plus RWA: Superstate USTB (tokenized short-duration U.S. government securities). Yield-generation engine. Falcon distributes yield from multiple sources rather than relying only on positive funding: ● Positive and negative funding arbitrage (long spot/short perp or the converse). ● Cross-exchange price arbitrage. ● Native staking on supported non-stablecoin assets. ● Select liquidity pool deployments. Rates and traction. Emerging in early 2025, Falcon Finance has quickly risen to the top of the synthetic dollar sector: USDf total supply grew from $100 million in the end of March 2025 to over $1.6 billion in early September 2025. The main reason for popularity is one of the best APY rates, which fluctuate between 8% and 15%, but is usually above 10%. Risk management. Falcon’s risk controls combine a live Transparency page that breaks down reserves across custodians, CEX, and on-chain positions with weekly independent attestations, published for ongoing verification. Its smart contracts have been audited by Zellic and Pashov with no critical or high-severity issues identified. Operational measures include off-exchange settlement: assets are held with MPC custodians (e.g., Fireblocks and Ceffu, and trading is mirrored to top crypto exchanges to reduce counterparty exposure. Additional safeguards include an onchain insurance fund launched in August 2025 with an initial $10 million contribution, and the acceptance of Superstate’s USTB in the collateral set, introducing tokenized T-bill exposure through a regulated RWA wrapper. Design. Ethena structures USDe as a delta-neutral synthetic dollar, created by hedging crypto collateral with short perpetuals and futures to target a $1 value. Its yield-bearing asset, sUSDe, distributes net income from funding/basis spreads and collateral returns. Collateral. Ethena backs USDe with Bitcoin, Ethereum and other crypto assets that it can delta-hedge via perps or futures, alongside allocations to liquid stables such as USDC and USDT to support liquidity and stability. The eligible-asset mix is overseen by the Risk Committee and adjusted over time. Scale and yields. USDe is the leading synthetic dollar with a market cap of almost $13 billion by early September 2025, an important signal of institutional acceptance of the model. Its yield is generated primarily from funding and basis spreads on delta-hedged perp/futures positions and, when used in the backing, liquid-asset rewards. After an early period of elevated funding rates in 2024, Ethena’s yield saw compression toward low single-digit annualized yields as more capital competed in the basis trade. Currently, its APY ranges between 6% and 10%. Treasury-backed line. In parallel to USDe/sUSDe, Ethena supports USDtb, a stablecoin backed primarily by BlackRock’s BUIDL tokenized fund, offering a cash-equivalent risk profile and direct mint/redeem mechanics—useful for treasurers who prefer traditional backing. Risk management. Ethena centers its controls on a public Proof-of-Reserves program that delivers weekly third-party checks of backing, coverage, and dollar-neutrality. Monthly custodian attestations further verify the existence, control, and value of reserves. Operationally, the protocol uses off-exchange settlement, so assets remain in MPC custody while hedges execute across venues. Smart contracts have undergone multiple audits, with published reports noting no critical or high-severity findings in those rounds. Design. Elixir structures deUSD as a fully collateralized, delta-neutral synthetic dollar: staked ETH (stETH/wstETH) backs the asset while an equal-notional short ETH-perpetual hedge targets a ~$1 value. A staked counterpart, sdeUSD, accrues protocol revenue to holders. deUSD’s yield comes from a blend of derivatives funding/basis and USDS/sUSDS treasury income, with the APY computed from a 7-day trailing sum of funding rewards and sUSDS rewards (net of EBF fees). Collateral. The core backing combines stETH (paired with short ETH-perps for delta neutrality) and USDS, Sky Protocol’s stablecoin. The project’s team plans to expand the basket over time. Scale and yields. As of early September 2025, public trackers show about $135 million worth of deUSD in circulation. Returns vary with perp-funding conditions and the Sky Savings Rate embedded via sUSDS. RWA rails and integrations. Elixir positions deUSD as infrastructure for tokenized securities to access DeFi: through a partnership using Securitize sTokens, holders of instruments such as BlackRock’s BUIDL can swap into sBUIDL and mint deUSD, while deUSD is accepted as yield-bearing collateral across Elixir-powered order-book venues. Risk management. Elixir publishes a dedicated Risks section (smart-contract, custody, execution, collateral, and regulatory) and implements off-exchange settlement so funds remain in on-chain MPC custody while hedges are executed across centralized venues. Smart-contract reviews include Trail of Bits, Quantstamp, and Pashov, alongside an Immunefi bug bounty. As synthetic dollars move from niche to routine portfolio tools, the choice of protocol increasingly comes down to what you hold, how you earn, and where you operate. We suggest to choose either one of the three approaches: If you prioritize breadth and steady returns in any market conditions, Falcon Finance (USDf/sUSDf) presents the golden middle. It accepts a wide spectrum of collateral, from major stablecoins and large-cap tokens to tokenized treasuries via USTB, and runs a multi-strategy engine (including funding arbitrage, staking, and liquidity deployments) that seeks competitive APY without relying solely on positive funding. It’s a natural fit for treasuries or funds with varied assets, with the usual caveat to check live yields and over-collateralization before sizing positions. If depth of liquidity and broad composability are central to your financial strategy, Ethena (USDe/sUSDe) offers scale and integrations with a well-documented mechanism. Yields are primarily funding and basis-driven, and a separate USDtb line caters to those that prefer a treasury-backed, cash-management profile, making it straightforward to match risk appetite to mandate. Where alignment with order-book venues and RWA rails matters most, Elixir (deUSD/sdeUSD) brings a funding-plus-sUSDS yield mix and exchange-centric plumbing. Current scale is smaller, so venue coverage and on-chain dashboards should guide position size, but the design suits trading-led workflows and RWA connectivity. Overall, the decision depends on collateral mix and yield preferences: Falcon for high-yield and multi-source income, Ethena for scale and funding-centric returns (with a treasury-backed option), and Elixir for exchange-aligned operations with built-in RWA pathways. Synthetic dollars matured in 2025 into a practical category that pairs dollar tracking with measurable, source-backed yield, but designs differ in collateral breadth, strategy mix, and operating scale. Falcon Finance prioritizes competitive APY, wide collateral support and multi-source returns. Ethena offers the deepest footprint with a funding-centric engine and a separate treasury-backed line. Elixir aligns tightly with exchange venues and RWA rails. Selection should follow portfolio needs: what collateral you hold, how sensitive you are to funding cycles, and where you transact, while continuously monitoring live yields, over-collateralization, and transparency disclosures.

Title: Traders Eye September Jobs Report for Cues on Bitcoin Breakout Above $120K

Crypto markets remained unchanged Monday and Tuesday after last week’s $1.5 billion liquidation flush, but traders remain cautious ahead of a critical run of U.S. economic data that could set the tone for October. Bitcoin bulls defended the $110,000 support level several times over the past week, while Ether clawed back from a sharp dip to $4,075 that coincided with nearly half a billion dollars in leveraged longs being wiped out. Total market capitalization now sits near $3.85 trillion, about 1.3% lower than a week earlier despite a 3.5% weekend rebound. The Fed’s most recent rate cut initially provided a modest boost to Bitcoin, but investors say the path forward depends less on past easing than on Powell’s Tuesday speech and upcoming jobs data that is scheduled to be released on Friday at 8:30 a.m. (ET). “The crypto market is at a macroeconomic crossroads, caught between a softening labor market and resilient economic growth,” said Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, in a message to CoinDesk. “This week’s data — Consumer Confidence, Initial Jobless Claims, and the pivotal September Jobs Report — will be critical in gauging the Fed’s next move. Any signs of further labor market cooling could reignite rate cut expectations, providing a tailwind for majors like BTC, ETH, and XRP. Conversely, strong data may extend the current period of uncertainty and pressure,” he said. Jobs data shows how many people are getting or losing work in the U.S. economy. If fewer people are working and unemployment rises, it suggests the economy is slowing. That usually makes the Federal Reserve more likely to cut interest rates to support growth, which can boost risk assets like stocks and crypto. But if job numbers are strong and unemployment stays low, it signals the economy is still running hot. That can keep inflation high, making the Fed less likely to cut rates. “This macro uncertainty is likely to maintain Bitcoin’s dominance, potentially capping the upside for Ethereum and the broader DeFi sector despite their superior yield opportunities,” Ruck added. Market structure reflects the indecision. A guage for sentiment fell to 28 on Friday, entering “extreme fear,” before bouncing back to a neutral 50 by Monday. Bitcoin has consolidated in a tight $108,000–$118,000 range, with open interest compressed and funding rates normalized after the liquidations. “The rebound is coming from roughly the same levels as in early September,” Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at FxPro, said in an email. “Once again, altcoins are recovering stronger than BTC. Such outperformance in the early stages of recovery often indicates the future winners of the race, which in this case are altcoins.” Kuptsikevich noted Bitcoin’s technical levels remain pivotal: “At the end of last week, Bitcoin found support at 109,000. It was bought at roughly the same levels as the end of August and even slightly higher, which is positive for the bulls.”“On the other hand, September's local high is lower than the previous one, which generally indicates a decrease in volatility and a stronger movement towards a breakout beyond the $108-118K range. Movements within the range can give many false short-term signals,” he noted. Ethereum faces its own inflection point. Analysts flagged a potential bottom, citing technical exhaustion after last week’s selloff. The token is also in focus after the launch of the first U.S. ETF with staking features, from REX Shares and Osprey Funds, with applications from BlackRock and Fidelity still under SEC review. News around Solana added to the altcoin narrative. The network’s total value locked surged to $12.2 billion, up 57% since June, prompting fresh calls for a $300 price target. Meme coins have grown more prominent as well, with sector capitalization climbing 70% over three months. Regulatory headlines, however, kept traders wary. The Wall Street Journal reported that U.S. regulators are probing potential insider trading tied to companies accumulating crypto reserves. Elsewhere, ratings giant Moody’s separately warned that the rapid expansion of stablecoin use in developing countries poses risks to monetary sovereignty and financial stability.

Once again, it feels as if we’re tiptoeing toward an official war between the United States and Russia — as opposed to the proxy war that has endured for three and half years between Russia and NATO-backed Ukraine. Although President Trump has downplayed the “rare and urgent” meeting of top military commanders from around the world at Quantico, Virginia, on Tuesday, the event has generated intense speculation. The Pentagon says that secretary of War Hegseth merely wants to deliver a speech on the “warrior ethos” and make sure that military leaders are all walking in the same direction. The president describes the focus of the gathering in general terms: “We’re talking about what we’re doing, what they’re doing, and how we’re doing.” Still, to gather the highest-ranking members of the U.S. military in one location for a chat with the president and secretary of War leaves the impression that something of significant importance will be discussed. On Monday morning, ZeroHedge gathered data from several sites that analyze open-source intelligence to predict military engagements. Those sites were all tracking a large deployment of U.S. aerial refueling tankers crossing the Atlantic on their way to Europe. A social media account that tracks pizzerias near the Pentagon showed a spike in orders late Sunday night. The last time these sources noted a wave of air tankers leaving the United States and increased carryout orders from restaurants near the Pentagon, the U.S. military was preparing to destroy Iran’s nuclear facilities. When these open-source data points are viewed alongside the unusual meeting of top military commanders in northern Virginia, it is difficult not to conclude that a potentially significant military operation is imminent. Notably, there has been a shift in public messaging from high-ranking government officials. U.S. special envoy for Ukraine Keith Kellogg told Fox News on Sunday that President Trump has authorized NATO to use U.S. missiles in direct strikes against Moscow. In a post on Truth Social one week ago, the president stated, “I think Ukraine, with the support of the European Union, is in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form.” Trump’s rhetorical departure from months of effort directed toward peace came right after a meeting with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky at the United Nations in New York City. While answering reporters’ questions at the U.N., Trump said that allies should shoot down Russian aircraft that enter into the airspace of NATO nations. Marveling at the president, Zelensky called Trump a “game changer.” In a separate interview on Fox News, Vice President Vance said that the administration might provide Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk missiles. Noting that President Trump would make the “final determination” on whether to equip Ukraine with weapons that can strike Moscow, Vance’s assessment of the situation nonetheless suggested that U.S.-NATO is about to take a more aggressive posture in the region. While signs indicate greater U.S. involvement in the Ukraine-Russia conflict in the near future, the Russian foreign ministry has been highlighting uncorroborated online chatter claiming that the Ukrainian military intends to use captured Russian drones in staged “false flag” attacks on logistics hubs in Poland and Romania. There are no hard facts to back this assertion, but numerous media reports coming from Hungarian sources have repeated the claim in recent days. Should Poland or Romania be attacked, President Trump’s recent comments suggest that there would be a swift U.S.-NATO response. As is always the case in war, propaganda and misdirection make it almost impossible to analyze this information. Ukraine has an obvious motive to undertake an operation against its allies in an effort to drag U.S.-led NATO into a larger war. Over the last three years, the Ukrainian military appears to have been involved in several attacks on NATO interests — including the sabotage of Nord Stream pipelines supplying Russian energy to Germany and the more recent attack on pipeline networks supplying oil from Russia to Hungary and Slovakia — as part of an overall strategy to separate Russia from European Union economic partners. At the same time, it is entirely logical for Russia to flood the information space with allegations of a looming “false flag” attack while carrying out an actual attack of its own. If something were to occur in Poland, Romania, or Moldova in the next few days, both Russia and NATO will accuse the other of spreading disinformation. These competing “narratives” ensure that confusion will reign — ratcheting up the prospect of retaliatory attacks and perilous escalation. I do not like where this is heading. The issue of U.S.-NATO support for the Kyiv government in its fight against the Russian Federation has divided American conservatives. Some Americans view Russia with such hostility that they almost appear eager for a direct U.S.-Russia confrontation. I believe that such a conflict has the potential to kill millions of people and put us on the path toward long-term global instability. Those who rush to defend Ukraine’s territorial borders routinely ignore that the eastern territories in dispute belong mainly to Russian-speaking peoples who have repeatedly allied with the Russian Federation. When NATO and Kyiv deny people the natural right to determine their own future in the name of Ukraine’s national “self-determination,” I find the argument for war ludicrous. This has always been a civil war involving historically Russian areas, and bloodshed began only after Obama’s State Department and European Union emissaries decided to expand NATO’s territorial grip right up to Russia’s doorstep by sacrificing Ukraine in a proxy war. Of all the reasons that U.S. and European politicians provide for the necessity of defending Ukraine, the idea that Russia’s invasion was entirely “unprovoked” is most laughable. Ukraine is not a member of NATO. Ukraine has directly attacked property belonging to NATO nations. Nonetheless, NATO appears ready to protect a country that has attacked its members and to attack a country that has not. This has always felt like another expedient “bankers’ war,” meant to put money into the hands of the world’s wealthiest financial institutions while stealing the lives and tax dollars of Western citizens. Over at The Conservative Treehouse, Sundance framed the issue aptly: The reason why the EU member states of NATO want escalated war with Russia is financial and economic. Through policy and ideology, the EU/NATO members have walked themselves into an economic dead end. They are out of assets to leverage. The only way out for the EU/NATO leadership is to create a war to erase debt, expand assets and reset the economics. While BlackRock, J.P. Morgan, and other World Economic Forum heavyweights divide up Ukraine’s assets and manage control over the Ukraine Recovery and Reinvestment Bank, international financial interests will turn wartime spending into a money machine. At the same time, all the self-inflicted economic damage caused by “green” energy regulations and central bank money-printing propping up the expansive European welfare state can be blamed on “Russian aggression.” Should the whole financial system near collapse, the perfect rationale will exist to implement central bank digital currencies and mandatory digital identities for Western citizens. Once again, governments will manufacture potentially catastrophic problems in order to justify “solutions” that nobody wanted in the first place. In this case, however, the problem that NATO governments are creating comes with the certain loss of numerous lives and the inherent risk of cataclysm. I don’t like this game, and I wish that wiser heads would succeed in preventing this violent calculus from reaching its ever deadlier conclusion. Right now, however, all signs point to madness. It looks as if a wider war with Russia will coincide with Antifa’s war against Americans at home. Prepare accordingly.

Once again, it feels as if we’re tiptoeing toward an official war between the United States and Russia — as opposed to the proxy war that has endured for three and half years between Russia and NATO-backed Ukraine. Although President Trump has downplayed the “rare and urgent” meeting of top military commanders from around the world at Quantico, Virginia, on Tuesday, the event has generated intense speculation. The Pentagon says that secretary of War Hegseth merely wants to deliver a speech on the “warrior ethos” and make sure that military leaders are all walking in the same direction. The president describes the focus of the gathering in general terms: “We’re talking about what we’re doing, what they’re doing, and how we’re doing.” Still, to gather the highest-ranking members of the U.S. military in one location for a chat with the president and secretary of War leaves the impression that something of significant importance will be discussed. On Monday morning, ZeroHedge gathered data from several sites that analyze open-source intelligence to predict military engagements. Those sites were all tracking a large deployment of U.S. aerial refueling tankers crossing the Atlantic on their way to Europe. A social media account that tracks pizzerias near the Pentagon showed a spike in orders late Sunday night. The last time these sources noted a wave of air tankers leaving the United States and increased carryout orders from restaurants near the Pentagon, the U.S. military was preparing to destroy Iran’s nuclear facilities. When these open-source data points are viewed alongside the unusual meeting of top military commanders in northern Virginia, it is difficult not to conclude that a potentially significant military operation is imminent. Notably, there has been a shift in public messaging from high-ranking government officials. U.S. special envoy for Ukraine Keith Kellogg told Fox News on Sunday that President Trump has authorized NATO to use U.S. missiles in direct strikes against Moscow. In a post on Truth Social one week ago, the president stated, “I think Ukraine, with the support of the European Union, is in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form.” Trump’s rhetorical departure from months of effort directed toward peace came right after a meeting with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky at the United Nations in New York City. While answering reporters’ questions at the U.N., Trump said that allies should shoot down Russian aircraft that enter into the airspace of NATO nations. Marveling at the president, Zelensky called Trump a “game changer.” In a separate interview on Fox News, Vice President Vance said that the administration might provide Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk missiles. Noting that President Trump would make the “final determination” on whether to equip Ukraine with weapons that can strike Moscow, Vance’s assessment of the situation nonetheless suggested that U.S.-NATO is about to take a more aggressive posture in the region. While signs indicate greater U.S. involvement in the Ukraine-Russia conflict in the near future, the Russian foreign ministry has been highlighting uncorroborated online chatter claiming that the Ukrainian military intends to use captured Russian drones in staged “false flag” attacks on logistics hubs in Poland and Romania. There are no hard facts to back this assertion, but numerous media reports coming from Hungarian sources have repeated the claim in recent days. Should Poland or Romania be attacked, President Trump’s recent comments suggest that there would be a swift U.S.-NATO response. As is always the case in war, propaganda and misdirection make it almost impossible to analyze this information. Ukraine has an obvious motive to undertake an operation against its allies in an effort to drag U.S.-led NATO into a larger war. Over the last three years, the Ukrainian military appears to have been involved in several attacks on NATO interests — including the sabotage of Nord Stream pipelines supplying Russian energy to Germany and the more recent attack on pipeline networks supplying oil from Russia to Hungary and Slovakia — as part of an overall strategy to separate Russia from European Union economic partners. At the same time, it is entirely logical for Russia to flood the information space with allegations of a looming “false flag” attack while carrying out an actual attack of its own. If something were to occur in Poland, Romania, or Moldova in the next few days, both Russia and NATO will accuse the other of spreading disinformation. These competing “narratives” ensure that confusion will reign — ratcheting up the prospect of retaliatory attacks and perilous escalation. I do not like where this is heading. The issue of U.S.-NATO support for the Kyiv government in its fight against the Russian Federation has divided American conservatives. Some Americans view Russia with such hostility that they almost appear eager for a direct U.S.-Russia confrontation. I believe that such a conflict has the potential to kill millions of people and put us on the path toward long-term global instability. Those who rush to defend Ukraine’s territorial borders routinely ignore that the eastern territories in dispute belong mainly to Russian-speaking peoples who have repeatedly allied with the Russian Federation. When NATO and Kyiv deny people the natural right to determine their own future in the name of Ukraine’s national “self-determination,” I find the argument for war ludicrous. This has always been a civil war involving historically Russian areas, and bloodshed began only after Obama’s State Department and European Union emissaries decided to expand NATO’s territorial grip right up to Russia’s doorstep by sacrificing Ukraine in a proxy war. Of all the reasons that U.S. and European politicians provide for the necessity of defending Ukraine, the idea that Russia’s invasion was entirely “unprovoked” is most laughable. Ukraine is not a member of NATO. Ukraine has directly attacked property belonging to NATO nations. Nonetheless, NATO appears ready to protect a country that has attacked its members and to attack a country that has not. This has always felt like another expedient “bankers’ war,” meant to put money into the hands of the world’s wealthiest financial institutions while stealing the lives and tax dollars of Western citizens. Over at The Conservative Treehouse, Sundance framed the issue aptly: The reason why the EU member states of NATO want escalated war with Russia is financial and economic.

Title: Vercel grabs $300M in late-stage funding to fuel its AI pivot

UPDATED 21:25 EDT / SEPTEMBER 30 2025 by Mike Wheatley Vercel Inc., the front-end development specialist that enables companies to build and deploy scalable websites quickly, said today it has raised $300 million in a late-stage round to accelerate its transition to focus on artificial intelligence. The company said its oversubscribed Series F funding round was led by Accel and the Singaporean sovereign wealth fund GIC, with participation from new investors BlackRock, StepStone and Khosla Ventures, raising its valuation to $9.3 billion. As more enterprises come to rely on AI for critical workflows, demand for developer-friendly platforms like Vercel is increasing rapidly, founder and Chief Executive Guillermo Rauch said in a blog post announcing the investment. Silicon Valley-based Vercel made its name helping developers build websites and applications. It’s the creator of Next.js, a popular open-source framework that’s used to build front ends for websites and applications. The company commercializes Node.js through a cloud service that offloads processing tasks usually done in the user’s browser to website operators’ servers. That allows those tasks to be completed faster, which reduces web page loading times. Having established itself as a developer favorite, Vercel has in the last year shifted its focus towards AI development with the launch of its AI Cloud platform. Its main component is a software development kit known as the AI SDK, which provides streamlined access to more than 60 of the most powerful large language models from companies including OpenAI, Anthropic PBC, Meta Platforms Inc., Cohere Inc. and others. The AI SDK has proven to be immensely popular, with more than 3 million downloads per week, making it the company’s fastest-growing open-source project, Rauch said. “Just like React brought accessibility to pages, the AI SDK is bringing accessibility to tokens to multiple sources of intelligence,” he added. The company also offers access to AI infrastructure and an open-source vibe coding platform called v0, which boasts more than 3.5 million users. Earlier this month, it debuted its very first AI agent, called Vercel Agent, in public beta. It’s primary task is to automate code reviews, scanning human- and AI-generated codebases, identifying problems and creating fixes for any problems it finds. Its fixes are validated in sandboxed environments to ensure they don’t cause any further strife. “Our bet on open source has become a powerful flywheel, and we’re excited to continue democratizing agents and making them accessible to everyone,” Rauch said. “We’ve evolved as much in this last year as we did in the first nine. Because there has to be a cloud that’s designed and purpose-built for AI applications. Vercel has built this from the ground up with the AI Cloud.” The AI Cloud has helped to ignite dramatic new growth for Vercel, doubling its user base over the last 12 months and increasing its revenue by 82%, off an undisclosed base. Rauch said its customers include some of the leading players in the AI industry, such as OpenAI and Anthropic, as well as big-name enterprises like PayPal Holdings Inc., Nike Inc. and Walmart Inc. Rauch said Vercel will use the funds from today’s round to expand its AI cloud services and enhance the v0 development agent’s capabilities. It’s also set to launch a mobile version of v0 later this month, which will make it possible for developers to build applications using voice and camera inputs. Separately, Vercel is also planning a $300 million secondary tender offer for current and former employees and early investors, which is expected to close next month.

Title: Will institutions follow Bitcoin onto other chains?

Structural changes, such as the approval of altcoin ETFs, might change how Wall Street sees Bitcoin. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The success of spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and major BTC treasury companies marked another step in the institutional adoption of crypto. US-traded spot Bitcoin ETFs captured $518 million on Sept. 29 and have accumulated $57.3 billion in net flows since their launch in January 2024, according to Farside Investors data. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) crossed $80 billion in assets by July 2025, becoming the fastest ETF to reach that threshold in just 374 trading days. Adding to the stellar performance, names such as Harvard Management Co. and the Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund Mubadala disclosed investments in Bitcoin through IBIT. The digital asset treasury movement expanded in tandem with the adoption of ETFs. Strategy increased its Bitcoin holdings to 649,031 BTC worth $72.67 billion as of Sept. 29. Meanwhile, Metaplanet up-sized its share offering to $1.4 billion in September to fund aggressive Bitcoin acquisitions, targeting 210,000 BTC by 2027. Institutions now face a choice between cold storage and yield generation. Max Gokhman, deputy CIO at Franklin Templeton Investment Solutions, noted that yield is a major driver for institutional adoption of crypto. And the SEC is clearing pathways for yield through regulated products. On Aug. 6, a staff statement confirmed that liquid staking tokens do not constitute securities by default, while the Sept. 17 generic listing standards expedited crypto ETF approvals. As more altcoin ETFs are set to launch in the US, potentially offering yields through staking, institutions will gain exposure to the returns that crypto has to offer. This change might impact how Wall Street sees Bitcoin. Bitcoin is scattered across 365,958.79 BTC in synthetic forms totaling $41.8 billion as of Sept. 30, according to Bitcoin Layers. As Bitcoin does not have native smart contract capabilities, the idea of a synthetic token, commonly referred to as a wrapper, is to allow the usage of BTC in DeFi protocols built on other blockchains. Babylon leads native staking with 58,271.77 BTC, generating a 0.29% APR through a self-custodial protocol that secures proof-of-stake chains. Using Babylon’s infrastructure, chains and applications can tap a security layer maintained by BTC staking. Lombard’s LBTC token transforms Bitcoin into a liquid staking asset with 0.82% APY and $1.3 billion in total value locked (TVL), compatible with Ethereum, Base, Solana, BNB Smart Chain, Katana, Sonic, Starknet, and Sui through native Chainlink and canonical bridge integrations. Threshold operates tBTC v2 across Ethereum, Starknet, Sui, and MezoChain with 6,335.31 tBTC bridged and $717.7 million in TVL. Solv Protocol offers its solvBTC across 12 chains, including Arbitrum, Mantle, and the Bitcoin mainnet, with $1.7 billion in total value locked (TVL). Meanwhile, b14g offers an average of 5% APR through dual-staking mechanisms that combine BTC with native protocol tokens, across a $300 million TVL. Zeus Network bridges Bitcoin to Solana via the zBTC wrapper, with $58.7 million in TVL using Multi-Party Computation for trustless cross-chain interoperability. It offers 4.52% APY on staking via Fragmetric. Thorchain facilitates native Bitcoin swaps for assets across different chains with $74 million locked. Bitcoin bridges processed $1.87 million in September 2025. Regarding chains with the largest amounts of wrappers, Ethereum holds 178,458.67 BTC as of Sept. 30, followed by BNB Smart Chain at 24,082.67 BTC and Base at 21,647.85 BTC. Besides the wrapper domination in established blockchains, Lightning Network presents itself as a significant rail for BTC usage. Lightning maintains $438 million in TVL despite a 20% decline in public capacity from 5,400 BTC in late 2023 to 4,200 BTC by August 2025. Coinbase reported that 15% of Bitcoin withdrawals were routed through Lightning by mid-2025, and CoinGate documented that Lightning accounted for 16% of Bitcoin orders in 2024, compared to 6.5% two years prior. Additionally, Tether deployed USDT over Lightning via Taproot Assets in January 2025, enabling dollar-denominated payments without locking BTC in channels. Despite the plurality of networks and wrappers that institutions could use to add composability to Bitcoin if they wish to, the key point of access remains through ETFs. Using BlackRock’s IBIT S-1 filing as an example, the document specifies that Coinbase Custody Trust Company holds Bitcoin in segregated cold storage wallets with multi-signature authentication, separate from all other Coinbase assets. In January 2025, BlackRock filed an amendment to IBIT’s structure to allow in-kind creation and redemption, requiring Coinbase Custody to process withdrawals to public blockchain addresses within 12 hours. Currently, there is limited room to incorporate yield pathways into Bitcoin ETFs, which would involve exploring the DeFi ecosystem using BTC. Additionally, the Financial Action Task Force’s Travel Rule mandates financial institutions and Virtual Asset Service Providers to transmit originator and beneficiary identifying information with virtual currency transactions. This standard requires end-to-end transparency to aid law enforcement and mitigate financial crime risks. ETF issuers must maintain segregated custody with regulated entities that are capable of producing audit trails that satisfy the travel rule requirements. Wrapped Bitcoin protocols introduce trust assumptions that conflict with institutional custody standards. Threshold’s tBTC relies on decentralized node operators to maintain the bridge between Bitcoin and Ethereum, creating a multi-signature custodial model where no single entity controls funds. Although this is positive from a decentralization perspective, it introduces a security dependency on the integrity of the validator set. Lombard utilizes Babylon’s Bitcoin Staking Protocol, combined with a consortium model for custody, which distributes risk across multiple parties. Again, there is an effort to decentralize single points of failure; however, this adds coordination requirements that complicate audit procedures. A Bitcoin ETF holding LBTC on Base would face scrutiny on Optimism’s fraud-proof system, Base’s sequencer centralization, and the bridge’s oracle dependencies. Each wrapped BTC variant trades off security assumptions. BitGo’s wBTC utilizes centralized custody with legal agreements, whereas Threshold’s tBTC distributes custody across validators, who must maintain uptime and adhere to honest behavior. These layered risks multiply audit surfaces beyond what segregated cold storage presents. Babylon’s 0.29% APR on staked Bitcoin compares unfavourably to Ethereum’s 3.2% staking yield or Solana’s 7.1% APY available through liquid staking derivatives. Lombard’s 0.82% return requires institutions to accept exposure to 13 different blockchain networks, each with distinct security models and potential failure modes. These examples reveal the challenge that a 1% yield advantage on a 5% Bitcoin allocation contributes just five basis points to total portfolio returns. Institutions might find insufficient compensation for introducing bridge risk, oracle dependencies, and cross-chain settlement complexity. Franklin Templeton’s Gokhman observed that institutions increasingly view Bitcoin as a cyclical, high-beta risk asset that correlates with traditional financial markets as institutional adoption grows. This framing suggests that portfolio managers prefer to separate their Bitcoin holdings from yield generation, maintaining BTC as a pure exposure play while sourcing returns from assets with more established DeFi infrastructure. An institution could hold Bitcoin through IBIT’s segregated cold storage while deploying capital into Ethereum ETFs that will potentially offer staking yields through proven liquid staking tokens approved by the SEC’s August 2025 guidance. Dividing exposure requires allocating capital across multiple positions but preserves custody clarity and simplifies compliance reporting. The alternative of bridging Bitcoin to access DeFi yields forces institutions to evaluate whether Threshold’s node operators or Lombard’s decentralized consortium provides equivalent security to Coinbase Custody’s federally regulated cold storage. Each bridge introduces a new counterparty, and each destination chain adds another risk surface that chain risk committees must review. The fragmented liquidity across 365,958 BTC, spread across different protocols and chains, compounds this complexity, as no single venue offers the depth that institutions require for entry and exit without market impact. In conclusion, Bitcoin layer-2 and alternative layer protocols offer technical solutions for yield generation. However, it is up to regulators to find a way to accommodate these paths into regulated products, and it is up to institutions to decide whether direct exposure is worth the risk.

Title: Letters to the Editor, October 1st: On disenfranchised voters, Connolly and Germany and leprechauns

Time Published: 2025-10-01T00:00:00Z
Full Content:
Sir, – The presidential election has highlighted to me a serious, archaic flaw in our electoral system. I’m a resident, registered voter, yet I’m legally prohibited from voting. On election day, I’ll be one of a group of 11 eligible voters touring in a music show across Germany. We join the tens of thousands of resident, registered voters abroad on election day who are disenfranchised. Millions more eligible citizens are disenfranchised because they live abroad. Even returning emigrants who arrive after October 24th have no say on who their next president will be. My touring colleagues and I are representing our nation, showcasing the best of Irish culture to thousands of people across Germany. Yet, in doing so, we are stripped of our right to vote. Germany is among the vast majority of democratic nations who have provisions for overseas voting, I wonder what their citizens would make of our disenfranchisement? This all leads to the question, how democratic are our elections when millions of eligible voters cannot exercise their legal right to vote? – Yours, etc, DAVE FLYNN, Composer and musician, 77 Camden Street Lower, Dublin 2. Connolly and Germany Sir, – We are lucky to have intellectuals with “largesse d’esprit” to correct pre-conceived stereotypes of other nationalities and remind us of important facts. Having lived in Germany for 12 years, I was shocked to hear a potential president of Ireland referring to the increase in military spending in Germany as having 1930s fascist overtones. I also find the insular attitude of some people alluding to “Europe” as something apart from Ireland antediluvian. Thank you, Fintan. – Yours, etc, MUIREANN NÍ CHINNÉIDE, Dún Laoghaire, Dublin. Sir, – I read Fintan O, Toole’s article with interest (“Catherine Connolly should keep her inner Basil Fawlty under wraps”, September 30th). He fails to take into account they are human beings with human foibles. Yes, she did make a gaffe, but was it necessary to write a full article on an obvious error? I look forward to reading his articles on Heather Humphreys and Jim Gavin pointing out their shortcomings. – Yours, etc, SIOBHÁN FITZGERALD, Bray, Co Wicklow Sir, – Fintan O’Toole questions the language that Catherine Connolly uses to highlight the large increase in Germany’s defence spending and whether it is appropriate of her to do so given Germany’s support for Ireland during the Brexit crisis and the threat of a hard border. A bigger issue than this and what we really don’t see enough discussion of is the volume of German arms exports, especially to Israel. According to a Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) report, Germany has been supplying 30 per cent of all Israeli arms imports, making them the second largest supplier behind the US. Additionally, the BBC has reported that German arms sales to Israel has increased ten-fold since 2022. Despite very recently halting the sales of arms to Israel due to pressure, Germany has not only been enabling Israel to commit genocide in Gaza, but also profiting from it. While Germany is a friend of Ireland within the EU, Catherine Connolly is right to call out Germany’s build up of their arms industry and how they are arming parties involved in conflicts, in particular Israel. – Yours, etc, CIARÁN HARRON, Shankill, Dublin. Presidential debate Sir, – The office of Ireland’s president is intended to be non-political. However, at some campaign events, and at Monday night’s debate, candidates were confronted with political policy questions. A candidate is likely to have a personal opinion about such issues, but if elected president they cannot state such views publicly. As president, the person can only offer such statements that coincide with the positions of the government. Reporters should keep this in mind rather than perhaps seeking to catch out a candidate in an awkward position. –Yours, etc. DAN DONOVAN, Dungarvan, Co Waterford. Sir, – Having watched most of last night’s presidency debate on Virgin One a number of thoughts came to mind. Regular political journalists seem to treat it as just another general election and the questions do not seem to relate very much to the office they are seeking. Somebody who understands the role might make a better chair, maybe an historian like Diarmaid Ferriter. A summary of what President Michael D Higgins did over the last 14 years could also help voters understand the role and the candidates could then outline their approach and vision. Discussing how a county council hasn’t built a council house in decades is important, but is for a different forum, I think. I am hoping to enjoy the rest of the debates but would love to be a bit more engaged by the chairs and the candidates. – Yours, etc, PARAIC CORBETT, Shankill, Dublin 18. A Ryder Cup suggestion Sir, – The behaviour of a significant and vocal minority of spectators at the Ryder Cup in Bethpage was very disappointing and unbecoming of a professional golf event. While some have drawn comparisons to scenes at football matches, I believe this analogy is misplaced. In a soccer match, it’s highly likely such disruptive individuals would have been removed from the stadium and banned from future matches. With the 2027 Ryder Cup in Adare Manor already well into its planning stages, now is the time for organisers to implement a formal code of conduct, making adherence to these guidelines a condition of ticket purchase. To start, those responsible for the worst behaviour at Bethpage Golf Club should be advised not to attend. Further measures should include limiting alcohol sales, ensuring that only sober attendees are admitted, and enforcing a zero-tolerance policy towards substance abuse. A dress code should be enforced, with a focus on traditional golf attire and a strict prohibition on any form of nationalist clothing. Additionally, introducing family friendly and alcohol-free areas could provide a welcome refuge for spectators who prefer a quieter, more respectful viewing experience. These areas could offer preferential viewing spots for those with moderate habits, creating a more balanced atmosphere and encouraging positive behaviour. The Ryder Cup has a great history, and it is imperative that contemporary spectators uphold the dignity and integrity of the event. – Yours, etc, DAVID CASSIDY, Dublin 9. Sir, – Surely the US players should have been more proactive in trying to stop the more outrageous behaviour of US “fans?” Sportsmanship? – Yours, etc, TONY WALL, Raheny, Dublin. Neutrality and aggression Sir, – The excellent letters by Brian Girvin and Donal McGrath (Lettters, September 29th) clearly set out Ireland’s vulnerability to any aggressive nation. As in the second World War, countries discovered neutrality was absolutely no defence against an aggressor. At present, various European countries are experiencing “unexplained” incursions by drones and fighter jets. Against this background it is vital that Ireland commits more funds to defending our territorial air space and seas. This does not mean more tanks and guns, but it does mean more high technology tracking and weapon systems and fully trained operators. Sufficient funds must also be committed to ensure all our naval vessels have trained crews and the best equipment. I appreciate housing and health are at the top of the Government’s budget, but the time has come to stop hiding behind neutrality and to take responsibility for our national security. – Yours, etc, MIKE CORMACK, Blackrock, Co Dublin. Penalising poor customer service Sir, – Yet again Pricewatch is on the trail of poor customer service provided by big telecom and airline companies. They always give so-called apologies in the so-called rare events of not meeting their usual so-called standard of care. Perhaps for a start we should be provided with a mandatory phone number for contacting these companies, with the apology made all the more real by having a premium of a euro for each minute over their target time of five minutes payable to their “valued” customers who are kept hanging on for ages waiting for a reply. After all our time is valuable also. – Yours, etc JOHN ROGERS, Rathowen, Co Westmeath. Car-free days Sir, – Your correspondent John Bergin (Letters, September 29th) makes a good point about car-free days and those of us who do not live in Dublin city centre. I have a routine commitment that requires me to be in Ballsbridge every Sunday at 10am. I can just about get there by public transport if I leave my house no later than 7.45am. The first train of the day will get me from Kildare to Dublin Heuston, after which I need to change twice – first to the Luas, then to the Dart – with a combined wait time of almost 40 minutes and a fare of ¤7.50. Alternatively, I can have an extra 90 minutes in bed, leaving my house at 9.15am in the car – for about half the cost. –Yours, etc, RICHARD BANNISTER, Kildare. Bus timetable changes Sir, – I agree completely with Robbie Wells (Letters, September 29th) on bus routes and numbers being changed without adequate notification. It was by chance I stumbled on this online. There was no notice to commuters, no regard for senior or neurodivergent travellers . No one in this community (Firhouse) was aware of it, when I pointed it out . Schoolchildren will be affected, second and third level. Senior citizens too. It seems high-handed , and disrespectful in the extreme. – Yours, etc, MARY McDAID, Dublin. Thinking outside Dublin Sir, – Eugene O’Malley’s proposal for alleviating the housing crisis by building a new town/city 30 miles west of Dublin (Letters, September 29th) is an excellent one. Beginning as a dormitory town for Dublin with a good rail service, this would develop independently with its own infrastructure. Apart from the many practical and political advantages O’Malley mentions, I would add that such a town, from the start, could take account of Ireland’s desperate need of biodiversity. Ebenezer Howard set out the principles for designing Garden Cities in 1898 in which gardens, allotments and surrounding fields would offer not only healthy, biodiverse green spaces, but the ability to grow much of the city’s own food. Many garden cities and suburbs have since been completed since. Such a town, west of Dublin as suggested, should be properly planned and financed and begun as soon as possible. – Yours, etc, TRICIA CUSACK, Co Wicklow. Sir, – Eugene O’Malley proposes a new dormitory town 30 miles from Dublin to relieve housing pressure there (Letters, September 30th). This to me seems but a continuation of the skewed development policy in Ireland towards the east coast. A more balanced plan would see the west being developed, more particularly the Limerick-Galway corridor which already has rail lines and other infrastructure and above all would hopefully dispense with the need for the ruinous Shannon to Dublin pipeline. This year again we have had algal blooms on Lough Derg which according to studies is a result of warmer weather and lower water levels. Do we really need to lower them further? – Yours, etc, ENDA SCANLON, Ennis, Co Clare. Don’t look up Sir, –Environmental headlines almost seem engineered not to pique the average reader’s interest. Last Friday (September 26th), I noticed two articles squashed into the right hand column, one by Caroline O’Doherty highlighting a mass fish kill on the river Blackwater, another by Kevin O’Sullivan titled “Algal Bloom on Lough Derg prompts call for investigation,” both concluding that we aren’t quite sure what happened, but investigations are under way. Human actions are what happened and we don’t need to read about the minutia of inconclusive forensic investigations to understand. What we do need is an active media that actually reports on the climate crisis and stimulates national concern. The following three or four pages detailed sporting achievements – hardly a more pressing subject matter. I urge editors to dedicate more resources and space to the real issues facing humanity. I am reminded too often when reading the newspaper of the 2021 Adam McKay film Don’t Look Up which accurately depicted humanities hypothetical apathy toward an apocalyptic comet heading for earth. – Yours, etc, THEO DILLON, Co Cork. Cross words Sir, – Morning completion of the Boston Globe mini-crossword has become the new normal in my household. You can imagine the consternation that ensued from this particular clue yesterday: “like leprechauns” with the solution being “Irish”. Thankfully, breakfast had been consumed as otherwise I would probably have choked on my muesli with no added sugar. Your Simplex at lunchtime continues apace with no such bombshells. – Yours, etc, FRANK J BYRNE, Dublin 9. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: IBIT flips to in-kind creations: what it means for spreads, taxes and flows

Tighter spreads, tax advantages, and smoother arbitrage: that’s the payoff as IBIT adopts in-kind creations and redemptions. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The largest Bitcoin ETF in the world has just revamped its process for moving coins in and out of the fund. BlackRock’s IBIT, which has accrued more than $20 billion since launch, can now process creations and redemptions “in kind.” The SEC’s approval order quietly flipped the switch: IBIT’s authorized participants can now swap Bitcoin directly against shares instead of only taking or delivering cash. While it might sound like a small operating change, the effects could be anything but minor. When spot ETFs went live in January 2024, the SEC required them to be created in cash. If you wanted to buy IBIT, an authorized participant (AP) like Citadel or UBS would sell you ETF shares and wire cash to Coinbase to source the actual Bitcoin. Redemptions worked the same way in reverse: sell ETF shares, get dollars back, and Coinbase liquidated coins to cover the difference. However, this model created a drag. Every creation and redemption process runs through a fiat leg, accumulating transaction costs, custody fees, and, most importantly, tax frictions. APs couldn’t simply shift Bitcoin in inventory: they had to finalize cash sales. That widened bid-ask spreads for large players and opened the door to tracking errors between IBIT’s share price and Bitcoin. In-kind solves this. Now, if an AP needs to deliver 1,000 BTC worth of IBIT shares, it can simply transfer 1,000 BTC from its own balance. Redeeming works the same way: return IBIT shares, receive coins directly, and no forced liquidation. Not everyone can do this. The SEC’s approval order and updated IBIT prospectus name four firms with the privilege: Jane Street, Virtu Americas, JP Morgan Securities, and Marex. These are the desks that already dominate ETF market-making. They now get to skip a step, moving Bitcoin in and out of IBIT’s custodian wallet without having to go through dollars first. That means tighter inventory management, faster arbitrage, and less basis risk. This also means that the spreads on IBIT should compress further. ETFs already trade at pennies around NAV, but with direct coin settlement, the incentive to quote even tighter grows. Then there’s the tax angle. Cash redemptions can trigger taxable events when APs dump Bitcoin to fund withdrawals. In-kind transfers are generally tax-neutral. For institutions managing balance sheets, that’s a meaningful edge. Some ETF lawyers argue it could also sidestep wash-sale complications, since redemptions now involve moving the asset itself rather than cycling cash. The SEC’s order doesn’t settle every nuance, but it makes IBIT look more like a gold ETF: shares backed by a stash of the commodity, with the ability to pull metal (or in this case, coins) on demand. IBIT already dominates the field, regularly pulling in more net flows than all rivals combined. CryptoSlate’s coverage of Farside data shows that IBIT consistently banks hundreds of millions, if not billions, in net inflows, even when its competitors experience losses. By lowering friction for APs, BlackRock may have just sharpened that lead. Cheaper creations mean market makers can quote tighter spreads, attracting more secondary-market volume. Cleaner redemptions mean lower exit costs, which matters to institutions worried about getting stuck in size. Both point toward IBIT becoming the default liquidity pool, with rivals forced to follow if and when they get in-kind approval. Despite the magnitude of the change, everything will likely remain the same to retail investors. IBIT trades the same, with the same ticker and fees. However, under the hood, the switch matters. Tighter spreads should shave basis points off every trade. Better tax treatment reduces hidden costs for large players, and if APs move inventory more quickly, IBIT’s tracking error to Bitcoin could shrink further, improving its pitch as a one-for-one proxy. The broader market effect? Expect more flows into IBIT relative to competitors, at least until they win the same privilege. And regarding Bitcoin’s liquidity, moving coins in and out of the custodian without fiat detours could boost turnover at scale, with knock-on effects for derivatives markets that hedge against ETF inventory. One way or another, BlackRock got the ETF it wanted from day one: a true in-kind Bitcoin fund.

Bitcoin and Ethereum fuel broader market rebound as sentiment gradually shifts. Bitcoin and Ethereum pumped by more than 2% on the day following massive institutional and whale purchases. The broader crypto market reflected the bounce, rising by a percent. Its sustainability depends on continued capital inflow into the digital assets. The last 24 hours have seen the whole of the crypto market bounce by 1%, with Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH] leading. The pair surged by over 2%, regaining previously lost key price levels. With only a day left until the last quarter of the year begins, sentiment is starting to shift. Whales and institutions have set the tone after almost two weeks of market correction across most of the coins. The shift in sentiment in the last 24 hours has resulted from several factors. SEC chair, Paul Atkins, affirmed his stance on making crypto his number one priority to fuel innovation in the United States. This induced confidence among crypto enthusiasts at a time the market was struggling. Institutions and whales were also loading up more BTC and ETH. Bitcoin Spot ETFs saw $518M in inflows, which is 4.6K BTC. ETH broke its 5-day ETF outflow streak as it received $546M in capital injection. Fidelity bought $299 million worth of BTC and $202 million worth of ETH, as per Whale Insider. Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) added over $20M BTC, taking the firm’s holdings to slightly more than 3% of Bitcoin’s total supply. Source: Arkham/ BlackRock (IBIT) also purchased $154M in BTC. On top of that, IBIT dethroned Deribit as the largest BTC options venue, with its Open Interest (OI) at $38 billion against $32 billion. For Ethereum, whales were closing short positions as they reverted to accumulation. The market rebounded, resulting in over $1.58M in losses for one whale, as per Lookonchain data. On buying, a new wallet by BitMine added $107M ETH. A whale also added $21M in ETH from the OKX exchange. On the charts, Bitcoin rose above $110,000, with the price reaching $114,000 at the time of writing. However, the BTC was seeing some rejection, with Crypto Tony predicting a pullback to $113,000. Looking ahead, price needed to break above $115K for a continued surge. If prices fail to stay above $110K, they could retest lower levels. Source: CryptoTony/X Ethereum also reclaimed the key support level at $4,000 that had been lost. Price briefly dipped below this mark and was now targeting the resistance at $4,250, which would allow for further upside. If the altcoin failed to stay above $4,250, the drop could be repeated.

Payments giant Stripe and corporate spend management player Brex have unveiled products that bring stablecoins closer to the mainstream. 2 Likes 2 30 September 2025 Be the first to comment This content has been selected, created and edited by the Finextra editorial team based upon its relevance and interest to our community. Stripe has unveiled Open Issuance, a platform that lets businesses launch and manage their own stablecoins with just a few lines of code. The company notes that businesses are adopting stablecoins quickly, with total supply growing 57% in the last 12 months. But by building on coins issued by external providers, they’re unable to reap all the potential benefits. For example, a neobank that sits on large stablecoin dollar deposits doesn’t retain the yield itself. When its customers want to redeem their stablecoins for cash, they’re subject to burn fees. Open Issuance - powered by Bridge, the stablecoin platform Stripe recently acquired - is designed to make it easy for firms to mint and burn coins freely, and customize their reserves to manage the ratio between cash and treasuries and choose their preferred partners. Treasuries are managed by BlackRock, Fidelity Investments, and Superstate. Cash is held by Lead Bank to provide liquidity as necessary. “If money movement is core to your business, you should build with stablecoins. But don't build on top of someone else's coin,” says Zach Abrams, CEO, Bridge. “With Open Issuance, businesses can build on top of stablecoins that they customize and control, so that the benefits of this important technology flow directly to the people and businesses using them.” Separately, Brex will soon let customers with a business account accept stablecoins with automatic conversion into USD in their accounts and send stablecoins directly from their USD balances. In addition, customers will be able to pay their card balances with stablecoins. “Stablecoins make it possible to move millions of dollars across borders in seconds, but using them typically requires fragmented workflows and managing multiple platforms,” says Pedro Franceschi, CEO, Brex. “With today’s launch, forward-looking companies across industries, from AI to crypto, will manage their largest payments and mission-critical expenses on Brex, in a single, secure platform.”

Josh Pack, the co-chief executive and managing partner of Fortress Investment Group, died unexpectedly at 51. Forbes examined Vanguard’s recent push into actively-managed bond funds. These are among the investment must-reads we found this week for financial advisors. September 30, 2025 Fortress co-chief executive dies, aged 51 “The company, which is majority-owned by Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala investment arm and counts high-profile European chains such as Curzon Cinemas and Majestic Wine among its portfolio, announced his death in a statement on Monday night. No cause of death was given.” (Financial Times) Why Index Fund Giant Vanguard Is Pushing Actively Managed Bond Funds “And while Vanguard may not be thought of as a hub for Wall Street bond whizzes like Jeffrey Gundlach’s DoubleLine Capital or PIMCO, its performance has been hard to match. According to Vanguard, 44 of its 48 active bond funds with a 10-year history outperformed their peer group averages.”(Forbes) SEC Directs ETF Share Class Applicants to Follow Dimensional’s Lead “In a Monday afternoon call with more than 100 representatives from asset managers representing most of the other applicants, SEC staff said firms will be expected to update their filings to look ‘substantially the same as’ Dimensional’s updated version, submitted last Friday, according to Kevin Gustafson, partner at K&L Gates, who was privy to the call. That directive affects the nearly 80 fund firms that have filed requests to use the multi-class structure since Vanguard’s patent expired in 2023.” (ETF.com) 4 Ways Your Clients’ Biases Are Costing Them Money “The technical side of tax-efficient investing is a known quantity, but the human side is far more complex. The most successful advisors understand that their biggest job is not to be a financial whiz, but to be a behavioral coach.” (Morningstar) Prosecutors Urge Court to Reject Ken Leech Calls for Cherry Picking Examples “Prosecutors this week hit back against demands for specific examples in its fraud case against Western Asset Management's former co-chief investment officer, arguing that the defense's objections misrepresent the government's strategy.” (FundFire) Public/Private Fund Liquidity: What You Need to Know “When new money stops coming in, managers may restrict or suspend withdrawals to avoid selling assets at inopportune times. This move, though, often erodes investor trust and signals serious trouble for the fund.” (Morningstar) Why “Downside Protection” ETFs Don’t Protect Portfolios As Well As A Stock-Bond Mix (In The Long Term) “Ultimately, downside protection ETFs can serve a niche purpose, such as holding short-term funds earmarked for near-term goals where principal protection is critical and the investor is comfortable sacrificing upside. But they are not a true substitute for equity exposure, and their complexity can mask the relatively modest benefits they offer compared to more traditional fixed income strategies.” (Kitces.com) The ETF Boom: Quality over Quantity “Should the market be concerned about this rapid pace of issuance or the sheer number of ETFs? Looking beneath the surface, the number of ETFs doesn’t tell the whole story. Most new ETFs have AUM: for those launched since 2024, the average AUM is about $230 million, but the median is only $25 million. In fact, roughly 875 have less than $50 million in AUM, underscoring that many launches fail to attract significant assets.” (JP Morgan Asset Management) BlackRock PE co-head: Semi-liquids could facilitate model portfolio adoption “Semi-liquid fund structures allow private market exposures to link into model portfolios more easily, according to Jonathan Seeg, global co-head of BlackRock Private Equity Partners.” (Private Equity International) Nuveen Aims To Raise $3B For Private Farmland REIT “The firm said that new farming technology, the expected growth in global demand for food and scarcity of undeveloped farmland will boost land values, according to its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.” (Bisnow) CAIS adds 17 private markets firms to its advisor menu “The CAIS Marketplace menu expansion includes strategies from Ares Management, AQR, BlackRock, Blue Owl, Coller, Eldridge, Fortress Investment Group, Franklin Templeton, Goldman Sachs, Golub Capital, Kayne Anderson, Kennedy Lewis, Morgan Stanley Investment Management, Eaton Vance, Nuveen, Veritas, Vista Equity Partners and others, officials announced this week.

Title: Trump Is Filling the Fed with Loyalists

Federal Reserve Jared Dillian | 9.30.2025 12:15 PM Council of Economics Chair Stephen Miran was confirmed as a Federal Reserve governor just before September's Federal Open Market Committee meeting. The impact was immediate—and troubling. Miran dissented in favor of a larger rate cut, and he put a dot on the dot plot—the Fed's survey of members' interest rate expectations—that was 150 basis points lower by the end of the year. Miran wants to lower the federal funds interest rates by 200 basis points immediately, which is well outside the consensus at the Fed. Miran wants huge interest rate cuts at a time when the stock market, cryptocurrency, and gold are at all-time highs, credit spreads are at all-time lows, the unemployment rate is only 4.3 percent, and gross domestic product just came in at 3.8 percent. His logic is that the labor market is weakening—it is, slightly—and he wants to cut interest rates to forestall a recession. But with financial conditions so easy, and inflation hovering around three percent—above the Fed's two percent target—an interest rate cut at this juncture makes no economic sense and risks stoking significant inflation. Miran has made statements in favor of Fed independence in the past, yet his actions now undercut that principle. President Donald Trump has explicitly called for interest rates to be lowered to 0.5 percent, he has installed his man at the Fed, and his man is doing his bidding. This is highly unusual. In the past, it has been political conservatives who have been hard money advocates, consistently pushing for higher interest rates and for fighting inflation. Now the liberals are the inflation fighters and the conservatives believe that a politically active Federal Reserve has been blocking the White House's agenda. One possible reason for Trump and Miran's intransigence on lower rates could be that they are trying to lower the cost of funding the U.S. government. T-bill issuance has been at an all-time high, first under former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen and then under Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. By lowering short-term interest rates, the Fed would effectively be lowering the amount of interest that the government would pay on its debt. But this is not the purpose of the Federal Reserve. The Fed is supposed to set interest rates and the money supply to equilibrate inflation and unemployment—its two mandates. Lowering the cost of funding the government is not part of the Fed's mandate. Bessent, for his part, is waiting for long-term interest rates to drop to term out the debt and lock in lower interest rates at longer maturities. This is a dangerous game, as the Fed's actions could actually cause long-term interest rates to rise. Trump now has one loyalist on the Board of Governors, and he will soon have more. It seems likely that Lisa Cook will be replaced, and Jerome Powell will depart as chairman in 2026 (although Powell will have the option to stay on the board). It's not hard to envision a group of Trump's Fed officials acting as a voting bloc, lowering interest rates to near zero and keeping them there even as inflationary pressures build. This is the monetary policy of Turkish President Recep Tayyib Erdogan. It has not worked out well in Turkey, where inflation has skyrocketed and the value of its currency has plummeted. This is the reason that central banks are supposed to be remote from political pressures. Politicians always prefer that the economy run hot to keep people employed. But a "fast" economy is not necessarily a "good" economy. During Alan Greenspan's tenure as Fed chairman from 1987 to 2006, the Fed prioritized vigilance on inflation. By contrast, the 2010s Fed focused on countering post-crisis deflation, showing far less concern about rising prices. The Powell Fed had to fight inflation in 2021–2022, and it did so incompetently. Absent Trump, the Fed would not have cut interest rates two weeks ago, and it would not be considering future interest rate cuts. Inflation is still high, and the economy can tolerate higher interest rates just fine—there is no compelling reason to lower them. Meanwhile, the search continues for a new Fed chair, and other candidates are being considered, including former St. Louis Fed President James Bullard and BlackRock executive Rick Rieder, who probably understands the bond market better than anyone but is clearly politicking for the job by advocating a 50 basis point cut at the last meeting. Low interest rates may be good for borrowers, but they are terrible for savers. There are trillions in money market mutual funds earning about four percent. If those yields disappear, people will be pushed into buying things like high-yield bonds or stocks, perhaps at the worst possible time. This would be an unprecedented experiment: slashing rates while the economy is already running hot. Start your day with Reason.

Title: Vanguard Weighs Allowing Trading of Crypto ETFs

The asset manager has for years spoken out against cryptocurrencies. September 30, 2025 (Bloomberg) -- Vanguard Group Inc. is weighing whether to allow trading of cryptocurrency-focused exchange-traded funds on its platform, a move that would mark a major easing of its restrictive stance toward the popular but volatile asset class. Should the switch go through, it would open the door for Vanguard’s more than 50 million investors — with some $11 trillion in assets — to gain easier entry to digital assets. Vanguard itself doesn’t manage any crypto ETFS, and clients of the Valley Forge, Pennsylvania-based investment giant currently can’t trade other firms’ Bitcoin and Ether ETFs on its site. “We continuously evaluate our brokerage offer, investor preferences, and the evolving regulatory environment,” a Vanguard spokesperson said. “If and when a decision is made, clients will hear directly from Vanguard.” The asset manager has for years spoken out against cryptocurrencies, saying that Bitcoin isn’t appropriate for long-term investors and that the asset class overall is “immature.” Its addition to portfolios could wreak “havoc,” its strategists have said. Former Chief Executive Officer Tim Buckley said Vanguard would never launch a Bitcoin fund, and its famous founder Jack Bogle once advised investors to avoid the digital coin “like the plague.” Related:Advisors React to the Arrival of Dual-Share Fund Classes But to industry watchers, the assumption of Salim Ramji, a veteran of BlackRock Inc. who succeeded Buckley to became Vanguard’s CEO last year, was a key development. Unlike his predecessor, Ramji — the first outsider ever to lead Vanguard — has expressed interest in blockchain technology and Bitcoin. The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 took the industry by storm, with fund inflows shattering records. Ether joined the party a few months later, when regulators approved the first spot ETFs tied to the second-largest cryptocurrency. Collectively, Bitcoin ETFs now manage more than $142 billion, with BlackRock’s IBIT commanding roughly $84 billion. Some $24 billion of that amount has come in this year alone, which places the fund in the top-five accumulators of flows among all US ETFs.

Title: SEC To Allow TradFi Stocks to Trade Onchain

Time Published: 2025-09-30T16:04:42Z

Written byLandon Manning Edited byMohammad Shahid The SEC reportedly plans to allow TradFi stocks to trade onchain by means of RWA tokenization. This would enable retail investors to bypass several key restrictions and use a Web3-native stock trading experience. Although it’s unclear when the rollout will happen or how ambitious it will be, the Commission is reportedly making this a priority. We could see a permanent transformation to TradFi markets in the next few days. The SEC has had a lot on its plate since beginning its newest pro-crypto initiatives, working on new ETF listing standards and regulatory innovation exemptions, among many other concerns. However, a new report details a particularly ambitious goal, as the Commission plans to allow TradFi stocks to trade onchain: BREAKING: The SEC is reportedly moving to allow stocks to trade like crypto, where stocks would trade on-chain.Under the plan, investors could buy tokens on crypto exchanges that represent shares of companies like Tesla or Nvidia. This news comes via a recent report, and it could have bombshell implications. The SEC’s proposed mechanism for bringing stocks onchain is fairly simple: it would offer tokenized RWAs. This would allow retail traders to purchase tokens whose value is directly linked to TradFi stocks like Tesla, Nvidia, or any of the other “Magnificent 7” tech firms. In other words, crypto investors would gain several distinct advantages. They could move their assets around 24/7/365, independently of TradFi’s market hours. This would also allow users to bypass regular brokerage institutions on the stock market, conducting business solely on Web3-native exchanges. BlackRock has been exploring RWA tokenization to bring TradFi stocks onchain, but its experiments were localized to ETFs. The SEC, by contrast, would open these services to a much wider range of products. It’s currently unclear if the Commission plans to launch a pilot program with a few stocks, or a laissez-fair approach where exchanges could list whatever assets they please. In any event, it plans to effectuate a concrete rollout “quickly.” The SEC is under political pressure to adopt a lot of different pro-crypto measures, but this onchain stock program seems like a particular priority. After all, the Trump administration is interested in TradFi/Web3 integration, putting economic data on the blockchain last month. Hopefully, the SEC will release an official announcement with more in-depth explanations soon. Putting Magnificent 7 stocks onchain would already be a huge market opportunity, but a total free-for-all could transform TradFi markets forever.

Title: Stripe Unveils Stablecoin Issuance Tool With Phantom’s CASH, Expands Into AI Commerce with OpenAI

Full Content:
Payments giant Stripe unveiled a stablecoin issuance platform and AI commerce tools at its New York showcase on Tuesday, marking a push to tie its payments business to the growing role of digital dollars and artificial intelligence in online transactions. Open Issuance, underpinned by stablecoin infrastructure platform Bridge that Stripe acquired for $1.1 billion last year, enables firms to launch their own stablecoins, minting and redeeming tokens with just a few lines of code. Phantom’s CASH token, an open-loop stablecoin by the popular crypto wallet provider, will be the first to debut through Open Issuance, the firm announced. The recently-launched stablecoins of decentralized exchange Hyperliquid's USDH and MetaMask's mUSD will also be issued through the protocol, with more projects already in the pipeline, the firm said. "If money movement is core to your business, you should build with stablecoins. But don't build on top of someone else's coin," Zach Abrams, co-founder and CEO of Bridge, said in a statement. "With Open Issuance, businesses can build on top of stablecoins that they customize and control, so that the benefits of this important technology flow directly to the people and businesses using them." Issuers can balance reserves between Treasuries and cash, with asset management handled by BlackRock, Fidelity, Superstate and Lead Bank. Stripe’s network ensures interoperability across tokens and aims to offer lower conversion costs. The AI side of the showcase centered on the Agentic Commerce Protocol, developed with ChatGPT developer OpenAI. The offering allows merchants to transact with AI agents while keeping control over fulfillment and customer relationships, the firm said. Partners including Microsoft Copilot and Anthropic are also testing the standard. These product launches build on a series of blockchain-focused moves by Stripe. In addition to acquiring Bridge, Stripe recently bought crypto wallet provider Privy, expanding its in-house crypto infrastructure tools. The firm is also working with crypto venture firm Paradigm to develop Tempo, a payments-oriented blockchain designed to handle transactions at scale. "With the advent of stablecoins and AI, we’re at the dawn of a new online economy," Will Gaybrick, Stripe's president of technology and business, said in a statement, adding that the company is focusing on "pulling frontier technology out of the experimental into the mainstream."

Preston Fore is a reporter at Fortune, covering education and personal finance for the Success team. Gen Z keeps being told their chances of landing a job are slim as AI threatens entry-level jobs. But in reality, Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang says, there are thousands of jobs for young people, thanks to an accelerating boom in data centers. They just have to be willing to go to trade school. “If you’re an electrician, you’re a plumber, a carpenter—we’re going to need hundreds of thousands of them to build all of these factories,” Huang told Channel 4 News in the U.K. “The skilled craft segment of every economy is going to see a boom. You’ve going to have to be doubling and doubling and doubling every single year.” And Huang is not just talking about the need—he’s backing it up with cash. The chipmaker announced last week that it was investing $100 billion into OpenAI to help fund the development of data centers based on Nvidia’s AI processors. Industrywide, global capital spending on data centers is projected to hit $7 trillion by 2030, according to McKinsey. A single 250,000-square-foot data center can employ up to 1,500 construction workers during its build-out—many earning more than $100,000, plus overtime—all without requiring a college degree. Once complete, about 50 full-time workers maintain the facility. But each of those jobs spurs another 3.5 in the surrounding economy. Huang’s call for more electricians and plumbers aligns with his broader view that the next wave of opportunity lies in the physical side of technology rather than the software. When asked earlier this year what he would study if he were 20 again, Huang admitted he’d lean toward disciplines rooted in the physical sciences. “For the young, 20-year-old Jensen, that’s graduated now, he probably would have chosen…more of the physical sciences than the software sciences,” he said. Fortune reached out to Huang for further comment. Huang isn’t the only CEO sounding the alarm about a looming shortage of skilled trades. Earlier this year, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said he raised concerns with the White House—arguing that deportations of immigrant labor, combined with a lack of interest among young Americans, are creating a perfect storm for data center construction. “I’ve even told members of the Trump team that we’re going to run out of electricians that we need to build out AI data centers,” Fink said at an energy conference in March. “We just don’t have enough.” Just this week, Ford CEO Jim Farley echoed those concerns, pointing to the gap between Washington’s reshoring ambitions and the workforce to make it a reality. “I think the intent is there, but there’s nothing to backfill the ambition,” Farley told Axios. “How can we reshore all this stuff if we don’t have people to work there?” The U.S. is already short 600,000 factory workers and 500,000 construction workers, according to a June LinkedIn post from Farley. And while the U.S. Department of Education has made the expansion of skilled trades programs a priority, some Gen Zers are already catching on. Take Jacob Palmer, a 23-year-old from North Carolina. After graduating from high school, he decided college was not the right fit. Instead, he joined an apprenticeship program at a contracting firm and trained as an electrician. By 21, he launched his own business—and last year grossed nearly $90,000. This year alone, he’s already hit six figures. Unlike many of his peers facing student debt and uncertain job prospects, he said simply: “I don’t owe anybody anything.” Have you made a successful career out of skilled trades?

Title: Solstice Finance Launches USX, Solana-Native Stablecoin With $160M TVL

Disclaimer: The below article is sponsored, and the views in it do not represent those of ZyCrypto. Readers should conduct independent research before taking any actions related to the project mentioned in this piece. This article should not be regarded as investment advice. Solstice Finance, an on-chain asset management protocol backed by $1 billion investment firm Deus X Capital, has officially launched USX, its Solana-native stablecoin, alongside the YieldVault Program. The launch marks a significant step for the Solana ecosystem, bringing a purpose-built stablecoin designed for native yields, transparency, and seamless composability. At launch, over $160 million in total value locked (TVL) has been deposited into the protocol. The initiative has secured backing from leading institutions, including Galaxy Digital, MEV Capital, Bitcoin Suisse, Auros, and Deus X Capital. Stablecoins have become a cornerstone of DeFi; however, most of the dominant assets in the sector were not initially designed for the Solana ecosystem. According to Solstice Finance CEO and Co-Founder Ben Nadareski, this has resulted in liquidity flowing out of Solana to other ecosystems in search of stronger yields. Commenting on the development, Ben Nadareski, CEO and Co-Founder of Solstice, stated: “Legacy stablecoins maintain majority market share, yet not a single leading stablecoin was born natively on Solana, and no dominant yield-native stablecoins currently exist in the ecosystem. We see stables often being bridged to other chains for best-in-class yield – that’s stable TVL leaving our ecosystem to try and earn elsewhere. We built USX, addressing this market gap on day one, a stablecoin that maintains all of the frictionless transaction benefits while giving access to institutional-grade yields that are native to the protocol.” Lily Liu, the President of the Solana Foundation, noted that the launch of Solstice opens new doors for developers, investors, and everyday users within the ecosystem. She emphasized that by bringing sustainable, real yield on-chain, Solstice is helping to reinforce Solana’s standing as a premier destination for defi. Several key components anchor Solstice Finance’s ecosystem. At its core is USX, a synthetic stablecoin that is fully backed with a 1:1 collateral ratio and secured through real-time Proof of Reserves provided by Chainlink. Complementing this is the YieldVault, the protocol’s flagship yield engine, which leverages delta-neutral trading strategies to deliver steady returns. In 2024, the vault achieved an annual performance of 21.5% and has maintained a flawless track record with no monthly losses since its inception. Looking ahead, Solstice plans to introduce SLX, its native utility token, designed under a community-first model that deliberately avoids venture capital allocations to prioritize long-term alignment with its users. Behind these innovations stands an expert team of more than 30 contributors with backgrounds from leading organizations, including Solana Labs, Coinbase, Galaxy Digital, BlackRock, Deloitte, and UBS, bringing deep experience from both the cryptocurrency and traditional finance sectors. Holders of USX can deposit into YieldVault and receive eUSX, representing their share of the protocol’s net asset value. This setup enables both retail and institutional participants, from $5 wallets to $50 million funds, to access transparent, delta-neutral yield strategies in a permissionless environment. Currently, Solstice is collaborating with over 30 ecosystem partners to drive integrations that further expand Solana’s DeFi opportunities. Solstice Finance is a decentralized finance protocol developed by Solstice Labs AG, a Deus X Enterprise company, in partnership with the Solstice Foundation. The protocol combines licensed fund management with innovative DeFi tools, bridging the gap between traditional finance and decentralized ecosystems. Its core offerings include USX, the Solana-native stablecoin, and YieldVault, a yield-bearing protocol designed for institutional-grade returns. Beyond DeFi, Solstice Staking AG, an affiliated infrastructure provider, secures over $1 billion in assets across more than 9,000 validator nodes, making it one of the most trusted operators in the staking industry.

Title: BlackRock’s Canada Bitcoin ETF opens securities lending: More yield, new risks?

iShares Bitcoin ETF’s new lending initiative seeks to balance risk and reward through stringent safeguards and collateral requirements. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock has confirmed that its Canadian arm has granted securities lending for the iShares Bitcoin ETF from Aug. 25 after providing investors with the required 60-day notice. The move follows disclosure in the June 26 prospectus, which outlined how the fund may engage in lending transactions in accordance with Canadian securities laws. The decision aligns it with other iShares ETFs in Canada, many of which already rely on securities lending to generate incremental income. Securities lending allows a fund to loan its holdings, such as shares or other securities, to borrowers, typically financial institutions, in exchange for collateral and a lending fee. Borrowers often use these securities to cover settlement gaps, meet collateral requirements, or support short-selling strategies. By opening IBIT to securities lending, BlackRock is effectively broadening the ETF’s revenue sources while emphasizing that protections will be in place to mitigate risk. BlackRock launched its Bitcoin product in the Canadian market in January. The fund allows investors to hold exposure to the flagship digital asset in Canadian and US dollars. It manages around CAD $358.9 million (equivalent to US$257 million) in assets. According to the prospectus, BlackRock Canada has appointed two affiliates as lending agents for the fund, including BlackRock Institutional Trust Company (BTC), based in San Francisco, and BlackRock Advisors (UK) Limited (BAL), headquartered in London. Under the structure, borrowers must post collateral worth at least 102% of the market value of the loaned securities. That collateral may take the form of cash or other securities, which are marked to market daily. BlackRock also provides a borrower default indemnity, committing to replace any securities not returned in the event of borrower failure. To limit exposure, no more than 50% of a fund’s net asset value may be on loan at any time. Cash collateral, when received, can only be invested in highly liquid securities with maturities of 90 days or less. The program will be supported by BlackRock’s internal risk management team, which uses proprietary technology and quantitative models to monitor exposures. The firm emphasizes quality, liquidity, and interest rate sensitivity when investing cash collateral, reflecting an approach designed to safeguard against market disruptions. Despite the safeguards, securities lending introduces risks that could impact holders. Some of these include borrowers’ delays or failures to return securities, potentially preventing the ETF from participating in corporate actions such as mergers or dividends. Market conditions could also lead lending agents to scale back activity, reducing potential revenue. Furthermore, shifts in tax or regulatory rules may alter the treatment of loaned securities, delaying or reducing payments owed to the fund. Still, BlackRock stresses that collateralization above 100% and its indemnity arrangement reduce the chance of investor loss. The policy ensures that, even if a borrower defaults, BlackRock should be able to restore its portfolio without a material impact. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.
