Crypto ETF issuer and asset manager BlackRock announced on Wednesday the expansion of its USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) to include five new blockchain ecosystems: Aptos, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Optimism, and Polygon. Initially launched on the Ethereum network in March 2024, BUIDL rapidly gained traction among investors, becoming the largest tokenized fund globally regarding assets under management (AUM) within just 40 days. The expansion will allow BUIDL to interact with more blockchain-based financial products and infrastructures. BlackRock aims to enhance accessibility for investors, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), and digital asset firms, enabling them to leverage BUIDL within the ecosystems of their choice. Carlos Domingo, CEO and co-founder of Securitize, the firm responsible for tokenizing BUIDL, emphasized the importance of this multi-chain approach in Wednesday’s press release by saying: Real-world asset tokenization is scaling, and we’re excited to have these blockchains added to increase the potential of the BUIDL ecosystem. With these new chains we’ll start to see more investors looking to leverage the underlying technology to increase efficiencies on all the things that until now have been hard to do. With the addition of these blockchains, BlackRock aims to provide increased options and access for investors, allowing developers to build applications that integrate seamlessly with the BUIDL fund. BNY Mellon, which recently received a Bitcoin and crypto custody license for institutional services, will play a key role in this initiative as the fund administrator and custodian for BUIDL. On the crypto ETF front, BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, has reached a remarkable milestone, surpassing the $40 billion mark in assets under management (AUM) just two weeks after hitting $30 billion. This achievement comes in a record 211 days, shattering the previous record of 1,253 days held by the iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (IEMG). IBIT is now positioned in the top 1% of all ETFs by assets and at just 10 months old, it has outperformed all 2,800 ETFs launched in the past decade, according to ETF expert Eric Balchunas. Balchunas further highlighted that Bitcoin ETFs collectively have crossed the $90 billion asset threshold, following a significant $6 billion surge in the past few days. This increase comprises $1 billion in new inflows and $5 billion in market appreciation. The growing popularity of Bitcoin ETFs indicates that they are now 72% of the way toward surpassing gold ETFs in total assets. The rise in Bitcoin ETF assets has coincided with a surge in investor confidence, particularly following Donald Trump’s recent victory over Kamala Harris in the presidential elections. This political shift has positively influenced market sentiment, contributing to a broader uptick in cryptocurrency prices. Bitcoin, in particular, has experienced a substantial rally, climbing over 24% to reach a record high of $93,000 in the past week alone.

Title: Where Will the COP29 Money Come From?
URL: https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/where-will-the-cop29-money-come-from-11731551991475.html
Time Published: 2024-11-14T02:39:51Z

(Bloomberg) -- COP29 Daily Reports: Sign up for the Green Daily newsletter for comprehensive coverage of the climate summit right in your inbox. The COP29 climate summit in Baku, Azerbaijan, has been dubbed the “finance COP” because its primary objective is to come up with a new and ambitious agreement for climate-related transfers from rich countries to poor countries. But that moniker could have been given to almost any of the other recent United Nations gatherings of world leaders: the COP26 confab in Glasgow in 2021 focused on enlisting institutional investors in the fight against global warming; the crowning achievement of the gathering in Sharm El-Sheikh the following year was a fund to help developing nations face the devastation of climate change; and at last year’s COP28 event, the United Arab Emirates announced a $30 billion venture to fund emissions reductions projects in partnership with BlackRock Inc., TPG Inc. and Brookfield Asset Management Ltd. Whether it’s Azerbaijan’s manat, or dirhams, pounds or dollars, every climate conversation circles back to how much it will cost — and who’s going to pay. In Baku, that means fighting over a so-called collective and quantified goal for climate finance. That’s the new post-2025 ambition that’s supposed to replace a target set in 2009 for developed countries to provide $100 billion annually by 2020. The earlier goal has proven controversial since it wasn’t met until 2022, and represents just a fraction of the money needed. Even if the new target were to be set at as much as $1 trillion a year, as some of the most climate-vulnerable states have proposed, that would barely scratch the surface. New research published this week by law firm A&O Shearman details an annual $6 trillion investment gap through 2030 to decarbonize the global economy at a pace required by the Paris climate agreement, to say nothing of the cost of adapting to a warmer, more volatile world. Moving from the billions to the trillions will only be possible by involving the private sector. Yet while COP28 in Dubai drew many of Wall Street’s top leaders, from hedge fund billionaire Ray Dalio to BlackRock Inc. CEO Larry Fink, COP29 is set to be a much more low-key affair. This year, banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co., Deutsche Bank AG and Barclays Plc have sent delegations to Azerbaijan, though these typically include members of their sustainability teams as opposed to senior executives. And that might be the appropriate choice given the more technical nature of this year’s discussion, said Adair Turner, who previously ran Britain’s financial regulator and is now chair of the Energy Transitions Commission. Financiers in attendance “will be those who want to interface with people actually building the new energy system, rather than people making grand statements,” he said. The biggest opportunities for Baku may not be “on these grand political statements,” Turner said. “We’re not going to get a tightening of the ‘transitioning beyond fossil fuels’ statement, but what we could get is some very concrete things about technologies,” such as commitments to scale up battery storage and grid interconnections, he said. Daniel Hanna, group head of sustainable and transition finance at Barclays, who has traveled to Baku, said he was “looking forward to talking about the progress that’s been made on climate finance, while recognizing that we need to collaborate to move faster and smarter on scaling the next wave of climate technologies, investing in adaptation and finding new public-private models to scale capital into the Global South.” For Turner, who spoke with Bloomberg Green on the first day of COP29, “the single most important thing” to secure at Baku is “a bigger role for development banks.” And right on cue, on Tuesday, the world’s largest multilateral development banks (MDB) announced a new goal to raise $120 billion in annual climate finance for developing nations by the end of the decade, a significant increase on the $75 billion gathered in 2023. MDBs can use their balance sheets to reduce the risks for private investors from allocating funds to nascent technologies and countries, where high credit risks to corruption typically result in a punitive cost of capital. “Many institutional investors are fiduciaries of retirement assets with a duty to focus on returns, and a lot of climate projects just don’t fit that profile without some risk-sharing or guarantees,” said Cara Williams, global head of ESG, climate and sustainability at Mercer. “We hope to see agreements on more public private partnerships announced at COP29 to de-risk investments and make it easier for private capital to be allocated to sustainable-finance projects.” And with many developed governments “under pressure fiscally,”making a modest contribution toward beefing up the MDBs “ought to be the easy win,” Turner said.“The amount of money that’s required to increase the capital resources of the World Bank are really relatively small compared with other things, so it ought to be the win-win here,” he said. Of course, there are very few easy wins in climate. And that’s especially so with Donald Trump, who has repeatedly downplayed climate change while promoting fossil fuels, returning to the White House. Sustainable finance in brief Speaking of which, one of the main drivers behind the right-wing campaign against environmental, social and governance strategies — other than Big Oil and its lobbyists — has been Trump himself. Now that he’s on the way back to the White House, experts expect him to try and finish off ESG. That would mean blocking Securities and Exchange Commission rules for corporate and fund disclosures, and Labor Department requirements on pension funds, according to Rob Du Boff, a senior analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. The new administration also is expected to put limits on ESG-related shareholder proposals filed during proxy season, he said. “The bottom line is the Trump administration is anxious to undermine these ESG-related initiatives,” Du Boff said.

Title: Bitcoin Price Could Peak In 200 Days, Before US Recession In Mid-2025, Report Says
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-price-peak-200-days-us-recession-2025-report/
Time Published: 2024-11-14T02:30:56Z
Full Content:
The current Bitcoin (BTC) rally could extend until mid-2025, with a potential price peak before a US recession. A recent Copper Research report, a recent crypto research firm, posits that the leading cryptocurrency by market cap could extend its bullish momentum until mid-2025. As of November 13, Bitcoin is on day 555 of its current market cycle, and a price peak for the digital asset could arrive within the next 200 days. Notably, this peak may coincide with a potential US recession forecasted for mid-2025. According to the report, Bitcoin’s market cycles average 756 days. The starting point of these cycles is when the annual average growth of Bitcoin’s market capitalization turns positive, while the endpoint is when it hits a price peak. The report marks the beginning of the current market cycle around mid-2023, just before asset manager BlackRock filed for a BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF). Should Bitcoin stay true to its historical price patterns, the digital asset can hit its price peak for this cycle sometime around mid-2025. The report cites estimates by JPMorgan about the likelihood of a US recession in mid-2025. As a result, BTC’s price peak might align with a potential US economic downturn. Based on data from Treasury spreads, JPMorgan gives a 45% chance of a potential US recession by mid-2025. The report further highlights the gap between BTC’s price top and realized volatility. For the uninitiated, realized volatility measures BTC’s price fluctuations over a specific period, showing the standard deviation of the asset’s returns from the market’s mean return. BTC’s realized volatility currently stands at around 50%, indicating that its volatility is only halfway to previous bull market peaks. Another bullish technical indicator for the BTC price trajectory is its filtered relative strength index (RSI). The report reads: Currently, the RSI sits at 60 – well below previous bull market highs – indicating considerable room for Bitcoin to continue building momentum into the new year. The digital assets market has been on a strong upward trend since pro-crypto Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 US presidential election. Notably, the emerging industry has witnessed its total market cap surge beyond $3 trillion for the first time since November 2021. The rise in total crypto market cap – largely driven by BTC – is not surprising since the Trump administration is speculated to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve akin to that of El Salvador under Nayib Bukele. Bitcoin’s unprecedented price action has propelled the digital asset’s total market cap beyond that of silver, solidifying it as the 8th largest global asset by market cap in existence. With this in mind, it will be interesting to see how BTC dominance (BTC.D) behaves in the coming weeks, especially after facing rejection just below the $90,000 level. Currently hovering slightly above 60%, a fall in BTC.D could signal a capital rotation from BTC into altcoins, potentially benefiting smaller-cap digital assets. BTC trades at $87,767 at press time, up 1.1% in the past 24 hours. The asset’s total market cap sits at $1.738 trillion.

Title: Every Warcraft 30th Anniversary Direct Announcement
URL: https://www.siliconera.com/every-warcraft-30th-anniversary-direct-announcement/
Time Published: 2024-11-14T00:15:00Z

Published: Nov 13, 2024 07:15 pm The Warcraft 30th Anniversary Direct was full of incredible surprises from across every Warcraft title, including some we haven’t seen in generations. From player housing (yes!) to a Classic refresh and The War Within 11.1, here’s every announcement from the livestream. The Warcraft 30th Direct kicked off where it all began: the RTS series. Starting today, Warcraft III: Reforged will update to version 2.0, boasting customizable updated visuals, quality-of-life changes (like hotkey customization), a revamped ladder, and “much, much more.” That’s not all when it comes to Warcraft, though! Warcraft I and II are both receiving Remasters with hand-drawn graphics and much-needed QoL improvements, including health bars, tooltips, a fancy new mission select screen, faster speed, band-box select, and increased unit selection. Phew. Warcraft I Remastered and Warcraft II Remastered launch today (November 13th) alongside the new Warcraft Battle Chest, which includes both remasters and Warcraft III: Reforged — as well as the beautiful Meat Wagon mount in World of Warcraft. The first major patch for WoW: The War Within is Undermined, kicking off Season 2 with lots of goblin goodies, including: From 30th Anniversary Direct’s footage, Undermined looks absolutely phenomenal. The art team didn’t miss here, with Liberation of Undermine potentially shaping up to be one of the best-looking raids of all time. The previously-announced Siren Isle will be hit live servers next month, with epilogues and story content leading us toward Undermined and beyond. According to the 2025 Roadmap, Plunderstorm will return between 11.0.7 and 11.1 with its promised new rewards. That’s right, they’ve finally done it. Player housing is coming to World of Warcraft… In the next expansion. World of Warcraft Midnight will introduce player housing after two decades of fan requests, though we don’t know to what extent just yet. Blizzard will announce more about player housing and Midnight in late summer 2025. Speaking of upcoming content, the 2025 World of Warcraft roadmap details a basic content outline up to the beginning of winter: World of Warcraft: The War Within Heartlands, a 5-part audio novella available right now. Heartlands is written by Adam Christopher and narrated by the legendary Chris Metzen, exploring what happened to Jaina and Thrall while we were busy adventuring in Khaz Algar. Any World of Warcraft Classic player knows the fanbase has been begging for a Classic Era refresh, and I’m happy to say that it’s finally happening. The Warcraft 30th Anniversary Direct announced fresh starts for World of Warcraft Classic begin on November 21 with WoW Classic 20th Anniversary Edition. World of Warcraft Classic 20th Anniversary features “very large” realms with PvE, PvP, and even Hardcore options. Additionally, QoL features like the Chronoboon Displacer and PvP Honor System will be available from the start. Like before, the experience will be split into phases over the course of around a year, before transitioning to… The Burning Crusade Classic returns in late 2025! WoW Classic 20th Anniversary characters will progress into TBC Classic after the conclusion of Phase 6, with the exception of Hardcore characters. It seems like Hardcore TBC isn’t quite on the table just yet. World of Warcraft Cataclysm Classic will wrap up with The Hour of Twilight patch in December. The not-so-surprising announce Once Dragon Soul has been swept up, Mists of Pandaria Classic will replace Cataclysm in Autumn 2025. The pre-patch, which brings Pandaren, Monks, Pet Battles, and Theramore’s Fall will fly in Summer 2025. Last, but certainly not least in the 30th Anniversary Direct WoW Classic announcements, is Season of Discovery Phase 7. Late Winter 2024 will see the arrival of Naxxramas and brand-new endgame content starring the Scarlet Crusade and Deadwind Pass. 👀 pic.twitter.com/RzjIa1oe4t Additionally, new Qiraji battle tank mounts were briefly teased in the live stream, presumably for new Ahn’Qiraj content in Phase Six. Coming out of nowhere like a sudden swarm of Zerg was the reveal of Heroes of Starcraft, a mini-set for Hearthstone based on the iconic Blizzard series landing in January 2025. The Zerg, Terran, and Protoss are each represented as factions with their own hero card: Along with cards full of Starcraft characters and references (plus a certain Murloc), Heroes of Starcraft features new music and visuals in Hearthstone’s most extensive mini-set to date. Being almost entirely unchanged in the decade since its launch (ouch, my back), Arena is set to receive some significant updates early next year. Players can choose between two versions of Arena: standard Arena with shortened runs and Underground Arena, featuring longer runs and a new “Redraft on Loss” feature. Redraft on Loss allows you to redraw cards and tweak your deck after a loss in Underground Arena. Both Arena modes will feature separate Arena ratings, with regular Arena matching players with similar skill levels, while Underground features a wild mix of player abilities. The 30th Anniversary direct showcased the roadmap for Year of the Raptor in Hearthstone, featuring three new expansions: Into the Emerald Dream, The Shrouded City, and The Heroes of Time. Into the Emerald Dream features the Druids of the Emerald Dream in a face-off with The Old Gods, heating up mid-season with a Druids of the Flame mini-set. The Shrouded City is Hearthstone’s first sequel set, sending players back to Un’goro to explore and party in the Festival of the Dinosaur mini-set. Finally, The Heroes of Time is a time-travel set featuring alternate realities and an epic final battle with Murozond in the End Time mini-set. What happens at the end of the expansion is something “[we] won’t believe.” The heavens have heard my call, and the once-mobile exclusive Warcraft Rumble is launching on PC with a beta on December 10, 2024. Alongside the beta are three new “Split Leaders”, who belong to multiple families: In addition to these exciting new heroes, Sylvanas will also become a split leader, joining the Horde alongside the Undead. That wraps it up for every announcement from Warcraft’s 30th Anniversary Direct livestream! What are you most excited for? World of Warcraft and Warcraft Battle Chest are available now on PC. Hearthstone is available on PC and mobile devices. Warcraft Rumble is exclusive to mobile devices until it arrives on PC later this year.

Title: 15 Best-Selling Irish Whiskey Brands in the World
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-best-selling-irish-whiskey-230358656.html

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. In this article, we are going to discuss the 15 best-selling Irish whiskey brands in the world. You can skip our detailed analysis of the global whiskey market, the Irish whiskey renaissance, and sustainability in the Irish whiskey industry, and go directly to the 5 Best-Selling Irish Whiskey Brands in the World. One of the oldest distilled spirits in the world, Irish whiskey is most often produced from a combination of malted and unmalted barley and is widely appreciated for its exceptionally smooth flavor and hints of vanilla. The use of unmalted grain began as a way to reduce the tax imposed on malted barley in the middle of the 19th century and is a key factor that distinguishes Irish whiskey from Scotch. Also, while most other whiskeys are twice distilled, Irish whiskeys are usually distilled three times in a column or pot still before they are matured in wooden casks for a minimum of three years. These intricate production steps combine to give the spirit its mellow and approachable character and turn it into a true gem of the Emerald Isle. READ ALSO: 25 Best-Selling Whiskey Brands in the US and 30 Best-Selling Scotch Whisky Brands in the World. Whiskey is one of the Most Consumed Alcohols in the World, with the global whiskey market valued at $64 billion in 2022 and expected to reach $91.3 billion by 2028, with a CAGR of 6% during the forecast period. The consumption of alcohol is shifting away from beer and wine and millennials are more likely to experiment with other alcoholic beverages, resulting in the growth of a ‘cocktail culture’. As a result of this tendency, the use of whiskey as a premium ingredient has increased. Product innovations such as flavored whiskeys and organic and sustainable options are also some of the major factors propelling the market. Ireland, once the grand capital of whiskey, is now once again making a grand comeback. The Emerald Isle has gone from once having just two operating distilleries – Bushmills and Midleton – to around 45 currently in operation, and several more in the pipeline. The value of Ireland’s whiskey exports crossed the €1 billion ($1.1 billion) mark for the first time in 2022, with global sales of Irish whiskey growing by 10.3% that year to around 15.25 million cases. The United States continues to be the top market for the category, representing 57% of the total export value. The Irish distillers have been especially focused on premiumization and the strategy seems to be paying off, as more and more consumers across the pond are turning to the smooth spirit as their luxury dram of choice. According to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, high-end premium and super-premium Irish whiskey categories have grown by an eye-watering 1,053% and 2,769%, respectively, in the last 20 years. Today’s consumers are increasingly aware of the climate emergency and actively seek out sustainable brands, even if it means paying extra. Therefore, as whiskey makers find themselves in an increasingly competitive market, committing psychologically and economically to reducing their impact on the planet may also be the only means to make their businesses sustainable in the long run. In this regard, it was announced last year that Irish Distillers, the Pernod Ricard SA (OTC:PRNDY)-owned producer of some of the world’s most renowned and successful Irish whiskeys, would adopt packaging changes such as removing gift boxes from its Jameson range. The removal will result in four million units being eliminated by the end of 2025 and will also be applied to other brands such as Powers, Spot, and Knappogue Castle. Irish Distillers also revealed in 2022 that it would invest around $55 million to fund projects aimed at transforming Midleton – home of some of the most popular Irish whiskey brands like Jameson, Redbreast, Powers, and Spot – into the first carbon-neutral whiskey distillery in the country by the end of 2026. The project includes shifting the distillery to renewable energy, increasing the efficiency of operations, and recycling the heat that is created as a byproduct of distillation. The aforementioned moves are all part of Pernod Ricard SA (OTC:PRNDY)’s Sustainability and Responsibility 2030 roadmap, which addresses environmental issues, social responsibility, and combatting alcohol abuse. If it stays on this path of sustainability, Irish whiskey can be at the heart of the blueprint to protect Ireland’s unique environment, while also continuing to be a modern, competitive, and successful industry that produces some of the best whiskeys in the world. With a market cap of over $30 billion as of the writing of this article, Pernod Ricard SA (OTC:PRNDY) is included among the Most Valuable Alcohol Companies in the World. While we acknowledge the potential of PRNDY as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PRNDY but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock. With that said, here are the Most Popular Irish Whiskey Brands in the World. Pixabay/Public Domain To collect data for this article, we have referred to The Brand Champions 2024 magazine by The Spirits Business, looking for the Top-Selling Irish Whiskey Brands in the World. We found information for only the top 3 best-selling Irish whiskey brands in the magazine and so we ranked them by the sales volumes of their 9-liter cases in 2023. Due to the absence of reliable sales figures for the remaining brands, we resorted to using popularity as a proxy for sales. Therefore, we picked whiskeys that appeared multiple times on websites like VinePair, Liquor, Men’s Journal, Reddit, etc., assigned them a score of 1 each time they were recommended on these sources, and then summed up the scores and ranked our list accordingly. When two or more brands had the same score, we ranked them by the number of upvotes they received on Reddit. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Insider Monkey Score: 4 Glendalough is often billed as being ‘Ireland's First Craft Distillery’ and is known for creating some innovative world-firsts such as the first Irish single malt whiskey aged in rare Japanese Mizunara oak, or an Irish single malt aged in Wicklow Irish oak, etc. Glendalough also pays special attention to staying sustainable and was named Ireland’s 'Sustainable Distillery of the Year' by the Icons of Whisky Awards in 2021. Insider Monkey Score: 5 Here we have an extremely smooth and creamy single-malt whiskey made by the Cooley Distillery, now owned by the Japanese Suntory Holdings. The Tyrconnell was claimed to be the top-selling Irish whiskey before Prohibition and its success continues to this day, as it is currently one of the fastest-growing Irish single malts in the world. Insider Monkey Score: 5 Also produced by the famous Cooley Distillery in County Louth, Connemara’s complex peat flavors and smooth, sweet malt taste make it a truly unique offering. Connemara is regarded as one of the pioneers of smoky Irish whiskeys and has even been honored as the 'World's Best Irish Single Malt', among other accolades. Insider Monkey Score: 6 Founded by father and son Henry and Alex Conyngham in 2009, Slane uses quality ingredients and an innovative recipe to create an exceptionally complex and smooth whiskey. Slane was acquired by Brown-Forman in 2015, following which the Jack Daniel’s maker made a hefty investment of $50 million to build a new four-acre distilling site to produce the award-winning whiskey. Insider Monkey Score: 6 Owned by the Sazerac Company, Paddy’s is a premium, triple-distilled blend of grain, malt, and pot still whiskeys. Often described as unpretentious and friendly, this popular Irish whiskey is great for mixing and has some very loyal fans, particularly in the south of Ireland. Insider Monkey Score: 6 One of the most famous Irish whiskey brands in recent years is Conor McGregor’s Proper No. Twelve – a smooth blend of triple-distilled malt and grain whiskey aged for four years in bourbon barrels, delivering a delicious taste with hints of vanilla, honey-like sweetness, and toasted wood. A majority stake in the brand was acquired by Proximo Spirits for a reported $600 million in 2021. Insider Monkey Score: 7 A unique marriage of single pot still and single malt Irish whiskey, Walsh Whiskey’s Writers’ Tears is a critically acclaimed, award-winning recreation of the fabled 19th-century dram that was a favorite among the literary giants of the era. Insider Monkey Score: 8 Named after the castle in County Clare, Kannpogue Castle is a range of vintaged Irish whiskeys that was originally founded by American Mark Edwin Andrews in the 1960s. One of the Top 10 Best-Selling Irish Whiskey Brands in the World, Knappogue Castle was acquired by Irish Distillers in 2021. Insider Monkey Score: 13 Dedicated to bringing new and innovative flavors to Irish whiskey, the Teeling Distillery opened its doors in 2015 as the first new distillery in Dublin in over 125 years. In less than a decade since its launch, the brand is already exported to over 80 markets worldwide and has won hundreds of international awards for its quality and depth of flavor. Insider Monkey Score: 14 With a history that spans over two centuries, Powers is the truest expression of Irish whiskey made at the Midleton distillery in County Cork. The brand has been part of Pernod Ricard since 1989. A three-time gold winner at the Irish Whiskey Masters in 2021, 2022, and 2023, the flagship Powers Gold is one of the Best-Selling Whiskeys in Ireland. Insider Monkey Score: 17 Distilled at Midleton for the family-owned Mitchell & Son Wine Merchants, the Spot series offers some of the finest examples of pot still whiskey available today. Produced in limited volumes, they are among the rare single pot still whiskeys still made today in a process that results in an intense, characterful aroma. With its fresh fruit and delicate spices, the iconic Green Spot whiskey was also included in our list of the Best Whiskeys in the World in 2024. Insider Monkey Score: 20 The most awarded single pot still Irish whiskey in the world, Redbreast is the definitive expression of this quintessential style of Irish whiskey making. Keeping up with its innovative spirit, the brand also introduced the Redbreast Tawny Port Cask Edition in September 2023, a limited-edition expression finished in tawny port casks from Portugal's breathtaking Douro Valley. With 56,000 9-liter cases sold in the US last year, Redbreast is one of the Best-Selling Irish Whiskeys in America. 9-Liter Cases Sold in 2023: 1.1 million Established in 1608, Bushmills is the oldest whiskey distillery in the world and is renowned for making exceptional triple-distilled single malt and blended Irish whiskeys. Proximo Spirits, owner of Bushmills, unveiled its new $48 million Causeway Distillery last year which has more than doubled its annual production from 5 million liters to 11 million. 9-Liter Cases Sold in 2023: 1.6 million Tullamore D.E.W. prides itself on its complex yet approachable flavors, which it credits to its use of three types of grain, a triple distillation, and the blending of three types of Irish whiskey – single malt, single grain, and pot still. Its sweet, soft, faint, and easy-to-drink character makes it one of the Best Whiskeys for Beginners in 2024. Set in the heart of Ireland, the Tullamore distillery spans a whopping 58 acres where 11 million liters of whiskey are produced each year, making Tullamore D.E.W. one of the finest examples of Ireland’s whiskey renaissance. 9-Liter Cases Sold in 2023: 10.2 million One of the Most Popular Whiskey Brands in the World, Jameson’s blended whiskeys are produced from malted and unmalted Irish barley before being triple-distilled, resulting in exceptional smoothness. Part of the Pernod Group since 1988, Jameson’s portfolio is led by its core offering of Jameson Original, with its super-premium expression, Jameson Black Barrel, also experiencing dynamic growth and offering a new taste experience. With a staggering 10.2 million 9-liter cases sold last year, Jameson is, by a margin, the #1 Selling Irish Whiskey in the World.

Asset management titan BlackRock is announcing the expansion of its proprietary BUIDL, the company’s on-chain money market fund, across five new blockchains. According to an announcement by real-world asset tokenizing firm Securitize, BlackRock’s brokerage partner, BUIDL will be expanding to layer-1 blockchains Aptos (APT) and Avalanche (AVAX) as well as layer-2 scaling solutions Arbitrum (ARB), Optimism (OP), and Polygon (POL). As stated by Securitize chief executive and co-founder Carlos Domingo, “We wanted to develop an ecosystem that was thoughtfully designed to be digital and take advantage of the advantages of tokenization. Real-world asset tokenization is scaling, and we’re excited to have these blockchains added to increase the potential of the BUIDL ecosystem. With these new chains we’ll start to see more investors looking to leverage the underlying technology to increase efficiencies on all the things that until now have been hard to do.” BUIDL, which launched in March and stands for BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, is a tokenized money-market fund designed to offer a stable value of $1 per token while providing yield on US Treasuries. According to Securitize, the expansion will help developers, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), and other crypto firms to build with BlackRock’s product on their blockchain of choice. Last month, it was reported that BlackRock was in talks with numerous crypto exchange platforms – such as Binance, OKX, and Deribit – about using BUIDL as collateral for derivatives contracts.

Title: Protesters Take to MoMA During World Jewish Congress Gala

Join Us One person was taken into police custody last night, November 12, at a protest outside the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) during the World Jewish Congress’s (WJC) 2024 Theodor Herzl Award Dinner taking place at the institutionSome 40 people gathered outside the museum’s 53rd Street entrance yesterday evening in response to a call shared by pro-Palestine advocacy groups, including Writers Against the War on Gaza (WAWOG) and Within Our Lifetime, to protest MoMA Honorary Board Chair Ronald Lauder. The billionaire heir to the Estée Lauder fortune is also the president of the WJC, a federation of Jewish communities and Israel advocates. Founded in 1936 to “support the establishment of a Jewish National Home in Palestine,” among other aims, the organization regularly lobbies on behalf of Israel and has rejected reports presented to the United Nations alleging that Israel’s ongoing attacks on Gaza constitute genocide. Before the protest began at around 5:30pm, police had sectioned off the institution’s main entrance, where the group crowded around a sign that read “MoMA Trustees Fund Genocide Apartheid and Settler Colonialism.” Chanting “Free Palestine” and “No justice, no peace,” they called on MoMA to disaffiliate from “dirty money.” A woman wearing an Israeli flag draped around her shoulders made her way into the group of protesters around 6:30pm and was escorted out of the crowd by police seconds later without the flag. Hyperallergic also witnessed an altercation between a suited man and a protester wearing a keffiyeh; the protester, who declined to provide his name, alleged that the man yanked the Palestinian headscarf off his neck. A police officer then ushered the suited man inside MoMA. Get the latest art news, reviews and opinions from Hyperallergic. Writer Sarah Nicole Prickett, a WAWOG organizer, was stopped by two police officers as she was crossing the street between two groups of protesters on both sides of the barricaded entrance. She was charged with disorderly conduct, according to a summons note reviewed by Hyperallergic. A New York Police Department spokesperson confirmed that one person was taken into custody and released with a summons to appear in criminal court next month. In an interview with Hyperallergic, Prickett said, “The least we can do is disorder things.” “We want these institutions to know that they can no longer silently, tacitly, and inconsequentially participate in the death-dealing activities of organizations like the World Jewish Congress,” she said. MoMA has not replied to Hyperallergic’s request for comment. The WJC’s Theodor Herzl Award, named after the man credited as the founder of Zionism, was given this year to United States Ambassador to China and Russia Jon M. Huntsman Jr. as a “devoted friend of Israel and the Jewish people.” Tal Huber, the Israeli graphic designer behind the red, black, and white “Kidnapped” posters wheat-pasted globally in the aftermath of Hamas’s October 7 attack, was also honored at last night’s gala with an award for advancing Jewish culture. During his gala address, recorded in a video posted to the WJC’s YouTube channel and reviewed by Hyperallergic, Lauder mocked what he said was an effort to rename Thanksgiving to “Indigenous People’s Appreciation and Remembrance Day.” In 2019, Donald Trump claimed at a rally that liberals wanted to change the name of the holiday but did not specify to what. “Now Thanksgiving has turned into a day that sees the same pilgrims not as brave souls who risked everything to escape religious persecution in Europe, they are now seen as colonial occupiers,” Lauder said. Later in his remarks, Lauder added, “This is hardly an American phenomenon. The Jewish world has been watching this self-hatred throughout Europe in France and England … That is why the World Jewish Congress is now focusing all our efforts on education and fighting this Marxist indoctrination that has infiltrated our schools.” Bobuq Sayed, a New York City-based writer from the Afghan diaspora who participated in the action, told Hyperallergic that they were protesting because “cultural institutions like the MoMA have a responsibility to cultural workers and not to billionaire benefactors.” Graphic designer Liv Senghor also attended the protest as an organizer of the environmental action group Planet Over Profit. “We thought it was important for us to show up as climate protesters to show solidarity and that we understand that all our struggles are connected,” Senghor said. MoMA has been the target of several protest campaigns targeting trustees’ links to human rights violations, military violence, and environmental damage. In 2021, a 10-week action series known as Strike MoMA called on the museum to drop board members including BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and financier Leon Black. In the wake of pressure over his ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, including an open letter from artists published in Hyperallergic, Black stepped down from his role as board chairman but remains a museum trustee. The World Jewish Congress has not yet responded to a request for comment.

By Blizzard Entertainment 14 hr 50 min ago It’s a big year for the Warcraft universe, and whether you’re a Hearthstone fan, you’ve joined the chaos in Warcraft Rumble, ventured into the world of Azeroth for the first time in Warcraft: Orcs and Humans, or you’re a World of Warcraft player, there’s something for everyone in our Warcraft 30th Anniversary Direct stream. Join us for a celebration as we dip into the mana pool of nostalgia and cast far sight on the future of all things Warcraft. Viewers can watch on any Warcraft, Hearthstone, or Warcraft Rumble stream on Twitch or TikTok to earn rewards during the giveaway period from November 13 at 10:00 am PST through December 11 at 10:00 am PST. Learn more in our previously published article. We’ve rounded up everything you need to know from the Warcraft 30th Anniversary Direct here. Jump directly to each section to learn more: Warcraft RTS, Hearthstone, Warcraft Rumble, World of Warcraft, World of Warcraft Classic, World of Warcraft: The War Within. It’s been 30 years since Warcraft: Orcs and Humans made its debut, setting the path for so many stories and adventures that have come after. To continue these adventures in the Warcraft series, we’ve released Patch 2.0— now available for all Warcraft III: Reforged players. The patch overhauls environments, lighting, and the user interface. It also introduces uprezzed classic Warcraft III assets to HD, allowing players to choose and customize their graphical experience. Mix and match assets as you wish. There are also new quality-of-life improvements such as in-game hotkey customization, updated ladder, and much much more. Beyond the update for Warcraft III: Reforged, we’re happy to announce the release of fully remastered versions of Warcraft I and Warcraft II, taking you beyond Orcs and Humans, the Tides of Darkness, and the Dark Portal for the first time, again. Players will be able to switch between the original graphics and the remastered versions in real time. We’ve also added more modern controls to Warcraft I, such as right-click move, band box select, and faster game speed. Both Warcraft I and II also have UI and UX improvements, such as tooltips and health bars, a mission select screen, and increased unit selection. Warcraft II will continue to have multiplayer functionality, and all legacy custom maps will remain fully compatible and playable. Travel back in time to experience each of these titles once more or— for the very first time— by visiting the shop: Warcraft I: Remastered, Warcraft II: Remastered, Warcraft III: Reforged. You’ll never forget the first time you hear “zug zug.” We’ve also brought back the Battle Chest, allowing players to purchase all three games in one bundle. For those who already purchased Warcraft: Orcs & Humans, Warcraft®: II Battle.net® edition, or Warcraft III: Reforged from the Battle.net shop, the bundle will be available at a discount. Early next year, Hearthstone is going beyond Warcraft and into... Heroes of StarCraft! This special Mini-Set will have a whopping 49 new cards across three themed factions, which show what the StarCraft universe would look like in the Hearthstone Tavern. Each faction is made up of cards that can be used across multiple classes, including an iconic Hero card. Zerg Death Knight, Demon Hunter, Hunter, and Warlock have joined the Zerg! Led by the formidable Sarah Kerrigan, they will have aggressive cards that win the game by swarming the board. Protoss Druid, Mage, Priest, and Rogue fight for the Protoss Empire. Led by the High Templar Artanis, they will have powerful, high-cost cards that are made cheaper throughout the game. Terran Paladin, Shaman, and Warrior make up the Terran forces, lead by the one and only Jim Raynor. They will command Battlecruisers—a special take on the Starship mechanic from The Great Dark Beyond. The Mini-Set will feature a slew of StarCraft units which are sure to invoke nostalgia, as well as the Terran-armored Murloc, Grunty, and new, thematic music. You can chart a course for the Heroes of StarCraft Mini-Set, launching in January 2025! More announcements, details, and card reveals are coming closer to launch. Then, for the first time in 10 years, Arena Mode is getting a major overhaul. With that update, there will be two kinds of Arena to choose from. Normal Arena will be shorter form, allowing you to complete your runs more quickly. Competitive Arena players will be able to play in the higher-stakes Underground Arena, with longer runs and a new feature: Re-Draft on Loss. Re-Draft on Loss means that, after you lose, you’ll have the option to re-draft cards, edit your deck, and keep your run alive. Ratings will also be added to both Normal and Underground Arena. Normal, skill-based matchmaking will be used for Normal Arena. Underground Arena throws caution to the wind and lets you face off against opponents of all skill levels. This major Arena revamp is coming in the first half of next year. Look out for more details about this update closer to when it goes live. On top of those updates, Hearthstone has an exciting year of expansions ahead, with much-requested themes, locations, and familiar faces across Azeroth. In the first expansion of the year, enter the Emerald Dream and join the battle between the Old Gods and the Druids of the Emerald Dream for the fate of the World Tree. Things will heat up even more when the Druids of the Flame light up the Mini-Set (releasing earlier than normal this year, during the 32.2 Patch). The second expansion of the year will be Hearthstone’s first-ever sequel: the return to Un’Goro Crater! Join Elise on a hunt for a mythical, lost Tortollan city. When you find it, join the Tortollans in a festival to celebrate the mighty dinosaurs of the crater in the 33.4 Mini-Set. In the third expansion of the year, travel with Chromie through alternate realities to recruit Legendary Warcraft heroes like you’ve never seen them before. Leading to the 34.4 Mini-Set: an epic showdown against Murozond at the end of time! It’s been one year since Warcraft Rumble went live. To celebrate, players can log in to Warcraft Rumble today and join the one-year anniversary celebration in game. Players can collect daily rewards, including new avatars and cosmetics! The Warcraft universe is built on rich and diverse characters that may not fit into any singular family, and because of this, we’re introducing split Leaders! In Season 10, we reintroduce Sylvanas Windrunner as the first playable split Leader, honoring her allegiance to both the Horde and Undead families. Later, we will introduce Malfurion Stormrage as Alliance and Cenarion, Orgrim Doomhammer as Horde and Blackrock, and last but not least, Anub’arak as Undead and Beast. Warcraft Rumble is coming to PC! The PC beta will launch on December 10, 2024; stay tuned for more information! World of Warcraft celebrates 20 years of adventure in Azeroth, bringing together players of all ages and abilities from all over the world, making connections both in the game and out. Inspired by the incredible story captured in “The Remarkable Life of Ibelin” documentary about Mats “Ibelin” Steen—now live on Netflix— a Norwegian WoW® player who suffered from Duchenne muscular dystrophy, you can add the Reven Pack to your collection and support CureDuchenne, a nonprofit organization dedicated to improving and extending the lives of those affected by this disease. Live now in modern World of Warcraft, players can join the World of Warcraft 20th Anniversary Celebration to collect updated Tier 2 armor appearance sets, undertake Classic Timewalking, engage with others to defeat iconic world bosses, head to the Trading post, and earn iconic new rewards, and more. The War Within has taken the leap into the first chapter of the Worldsoul Saga and adventures continue in WoW Classic, but this is only the beginning of what we have planned. Currently, in Season of Discovery, players are exploring new adventures with new class abilities, all-new level-up raids, finding secrets, and teaming up to defeat Ragnaros and Nefarian. It won’t be long until everyone can join the War Effort and open the gates to Ahn’Qiraj, where they’ll get to plunder the depths for new rewards and face new challenges. After Ahn’Qiraj, players in Season of Discovery can look forward to one more phase, in which they’ll face the dangers of Naxxramas, along with new instanced content featuring the Scarlet Crusade as well as adventures in Deadwind Pass! In Cataclysm Classic, Ragnaros has risen in the Firelands once more, and players are working toward adding the Dragonwrath Staff to their collection. In the final phase of Cataclysm Classic, players will experience the Hour of Twilight patch and Dragon Soul raid dungeon early next year. And that’s not all we have in store for Classic World of Warcraft. We’re pleased to announce that Mists of Pandaria Classic will be arriving in the summer of 2025, taking players back to the shores of Pandaria and bringing its legendary class design, incredible raids and dungeons, stunning environments, and (of course) an unforgettable soundtrack. Relive the World of Warcraft Classic experience with all-new fresh realms in the WoW Classic 20th Anniversary Edition arriving November 21. Join players on a whole new journey to level 60, with the first raid dungeon, Molten Core, becoming available a few weeks after launch. Choose to play on a PvP realm, a Normal PvE realm, or (for the very first time) a Hardcore realm progressing through content with the other realms — all from the beginning, with fresh economies, on very large realms. These realms will launch with some of the quality-of-life features that came later in the WoW Classic cycle, such as the Chronoboon Displacer to save your world buffs and the improved PvP Honor Ranking system. The PvP and Normal PvE realms will also progress into Burning Crusade Classic! It's never too late to go back and re-experience World of Warcraft anew—just in time to celebrate 20 years of adventures in Azeroth! The first chapter of the Worldsoul Saga kicked off in August with the launch of The War Within, bringing with it myriad new experiences with a new raid, dungeons, delves, PvP, new appearances and rewards, pets, mounts and much more. On the horizon, our next content update, Siren Isle, is currently available on the Public Test Realms (PTR), and the update will go live next month with a little something for everyone. This update also includes the epilogue questline for Dalaran and the Kirin Tor. No spoilers, but the storyline will feature the mysterious haranir, who also starred in the expansion release cinematic. The Siren Isle introduces a new outdoor environment to explore, full of mysteries to uncover and rewards to help catch your alternate characters up and prepare for the next War Within season ahead. Plunderstorm is returning with a new Plunderstore to provide more flexibility for earning rewards instead of a linear Renown track. There are also some quality-of-life changes to spell interactions, the UI and more ahead. The Siren Isle content update also brings with it Turbulent Timeways once more and additional updates to the Feast of Winter Veil in-game holiday event. We’re introducing a new novella that explores more of the story behind the scenes. Find out what happened with Jaina and Thrall after the Fall of Dalaran as they seek out reinforcements in this five-chapter special— available today and as read by Chris Metzen! Listen and read here. Xal’atath’s trail leads adventurers to a location in our next major content update that has long been known about but, as yet, remained unexplored—the Undermine. Players will travel deep into the goblin city of Undermine, the capital of the goblin’s trade empire! It is a city like none other seen before in World of Warcraft and stands as a testament to goblin intelligence and creativity as experts in both technology and alchemy. As our adventures continue, we’ll learn more about goblin culture and society that we have never been able to see before. We’ll learn what’s important to them, the problems they are trying to solve —everything that makes them truly unique, and what they’re capable of as a society. We’ll dig a bit deeper beyond just their humor and explosions, though there will still be explosions and a LOT of mayhem to be found. You’ll arrive in an Undermine that’s in conflict between the four major goblin cartels: Steamwheedle, Blackwater, Bilgewater, and the Venture Company. Each cartel is run by notorious goblins like Monte Gazlowe, Renzik “The Shiv,” Baron Revilgaz, Marin Noggenfogger, and more. Which one you align yourself with is up to you. You’ll want to make sure you have a sweet ride to roll around town in— players can earn a customizable vehicle early on that’s designed just for use in Undermine. You’ll push the boundaries of locomotion on the roads of Undermine and speed through its causeways and byways at a higher rate than a ground mount can. Players can adjust the car’s driving characteristics by adding a little extra grip to hug the roads or adjust to slide and glide as they drift around corners. Want to accelerate faster? Then, you may have to sacrifice a little speed. How you customize your car’s characteristics is up to you. The new dungeon, Operation: Floodgate, builds on the narrative of Undermine as players race to stop a group of goblins from blowing a dam that will bring ruin to the Ringing Deeps. This new dungeon will be available immediately as a part of the new The War Within Season 2 dungeon pool on Heroic, Mythic, and Mythic+, alongside the four other launch dungeons and three legacy dungeons. We’ll share more information on the full slate of dungeons at a later point, but we would be remiss if we didn’t include MOTHERLODE from Battle for Azeroth in the rotation. Players will also experience two new Delves and variations of existing Delves in the content update. Seasonal updates are also being introduced to Brann Bronzebeard, a new adversary to follow, Zek’vir, and a new set of goblin-inspired Curios. Experience a new 8-boss raid dungeon that takes you through the city streets and into the magnificent Gallagio— brimming with color and extravagance, it houses the dark secrets of its owner— Gallywix. There’s more at play here than it first seems, and goblin politics are treacherous and fraught with the underpinnings of something more where Xal’atath is concerned. There’s even more ahead in 2025, and we have the roadmaps to help guide you on what you can look forward to in World of Warcraft and WoW Classic. Thank you for making Azeroth your home over these last two decades. Speaking of home, the World of Warcraft team has one last thing to share with you… And yes, in World of Warcraft: Midnight, your next adventure begins at home. A house to call your very own. Stay tuned! Wherever your gaming experience takes you, we can’t wait to continue on this journey with you all. Lok’tar ogar! We’ll see you at the Inn, in Azeroth, and wherever the road takes us all next!

Title: BlackRock strengthens tokenization push with BUIDL’s multi-chain expansion

BUIDL's growth on popular blockchains promises new ventures for DAOs and digital firms, despite varied fees. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) has expanded its reach to multiple blockchain networks, including Aptos, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Optimism, and Polygon, according to a Nov. 13 statement. This expansion is part of BlackRock’s strategy to strengthen its tokenization efforts, transforming BUIDL into a multi-chain asset. It enables users and applications within these blockchain ecosystems to access BUIDL more efficiently. The fund, which primarily invests in US Treasuries, cash, and other liquid assets, will offer new users across these blockchain networks features such as on-chain yield, flexible custody, real-time peer-to-peer transfers, and on-chain dividend accrual and distribution. Securitize CEO Carlos Domingo emphasized that the expansion aligns with the company’s vision to build a tokenization-based ecosystem. He pointed out that these new blockchains would enhance BUIDL’s potential, especially as the tokenization of real-world assets continues to gain traction. He stated: “With these new chains we’ll start to see more investors looking to leverage the underlying technology to increase efficiencies on all the things that until now have been hard to do.” BNY Mellon, the fund’s administrator, is backing this expansion and will continue to act as its custodian across these additional blockchain networks. According to the press statement, BUIDL became the largest tokenized fund by assets under management (AUM) less than 40 days after its launch on the Ethereum blockchain. According to DeFillama data, BUIDL’s market capitalization stood at $518 million at the time of writing. The expansion to other blockchain networks opens up new investment opportunities for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), digital asset firms, and other market participants.

By Blizzard Entertainment 1 day ago It’s a big year for the Warcraft universe, and whether you’re a Hearthstone fan, you’ve joined the chaos in Warcraft Rumble, ventured into the world of Azeroth for the first time in Warcraft: Orcs and Humans, or you’re a World of Warcraft player, there’s something for everyone in our Warcraft 30th Anniversary Direct stream. Join us for a celebration as we dip into the mana pool of nostalgia and cast far sight on the future of all things Warcraft. Viewers can watch on any Warcraft, Hearthstone, or Warcraft Rumble stream on Twitch or TikTok to earn rewards during the giveaway period from November 13 at 18:00 GMT through December 11 at 18:00 GMT. Learn more in our previously published article. We’ve rounded up everything you need to know from the Warcraft 30th Anniversary Direct here. Jump directly to each section to learn more: Warcraft RTS, Hearthstone, Warcraft Rumble, World of Warcraft, World of Warcraft Classic, World of Warcraft: The War Within. It’s been 30 years since Warcraft: Orcs and Humans made its debut, setting the path for so many stories and adventures that have come after. To continue these adventures in the Warcraft series, we’ve released Patch 2.0— now available for all Warcraft III: Reforged players. The patch overhauls environments, lighting, and the user interface. It also introduces uprezzed classic Warcraft III assets to HD, allowing players to choose and customize their graphical experience. Mix and match assets as you wish. There are also new quality-of-life improvements such as in-game hotkey customization, updated ladder, and much much more. Beyond the update for Warcraft III: Reforged, we’re happy to announce the release of fully remastered versions of Warcraft I and Warcraft II, taking you beyond Orcs and Humans, the Tides of Darkness, and the Dark Portal for the first time, again. Players will be able to switch between the original graphics and the remastered versions in real time. We’ve also added more modern controls to Warcraft I, such as right-click move, band box select, and faster game speed. Both Warcraft I and II also have UI and UX improvements, such as tooltips and health bars, a mission select screen, and increased unit selection. Warcraft II will continue to have multiplayer functionality, and all legacy custom maps will remain fully compatible and playable. Travel back in time to experience each of these titles once more or— for the very first time— by visiting the shop: Warcraft I: Remastered, Warcraft II: Remastered, Warcraft III: Reforged. You’ll never forget the first time you hear “zug zug.” We’ve also brought back the Battle Chest, allowing players to purchase all three games in one bundle. For those who already purchased Warcraft: Orcs & Humans, Warcraft®: II Battle.net® edition, or Warcraft III: Reforged from the Battle.net shop, the bundle will be available at a discount. Early next year, Hearthstone is going beyond Warcraft and into... Heroes of StarCraft! This special Mini-Set will have a whopping 49 new cards across three themed factions, which show what the StarCraft universe would look like in the Hearthstone Tavern. Each faction is made up of cards that can be used across multiple classes, including an iconic Hero card. Zerg Death Knight, Demon Hunter, Hunter, and Warlock have joined the Zerg! Led by the formidable Sarah Kerrigan, they will have aggressive cards that win the game by swarming the board. Protoss Druid, Mage, Priest, and Rogue fight for the Protoss Empire. Led by the High Templar Artanis, they will have powerful, high-cost cards that are made cheaper throughout the game. Terran Paladin, Shaman, and Warrior make up the Terran forces, lead by the one and only Jim Raynor. They will command Battlecruisers—a special take on the Starship mechanic from The Great Dark Beyond. The Mini-Set will feature a slew of StarCraft units which are sure to invoke nostalgia, as well as the Terran-armored Murloc, Grunty, and new, thematic music. You can chart a course for the Heroes of StarCraft Mini-Set, launching in January 2025! More announcements, details, and card reveals are coming closer to launch. Then, for the first time in 10 years, Arena Mode is getting a major overhaul. With that update, there will be two kinds of Arena to choose from. Normal Arena will be shorter form, allowing you to complete your runs more quickly. Competitive Arena players will be able to play in the higher-stakes Underground Arena, with longer runs and a new feature: Re-Draft on Loss. Re-Draft on Loss means that, after you lose, you’ll have the option to re-draft cards, edit your deck, and keep your run alive. Ratings will also be added to both Normal and Underground Arena. Normal, skill-based matchmaking will be used for Normal Arena. Underground Arena throws caution to the wind and lets you face off against opponents of all skill levels. This major Arena revamp is coming in the first half of next year. Look out for more details about this update closer to when it goes live. On top of those updates, Hearthstone has an exciting year of expansions ahead, with much-requested themes, locations, and familiar faces across Azeroth. In the first expansion of the year, enter the Emerald Dream and join the battle between the Old Gods and the Druids of the Emerald Dream for the fate of the World Tree. Things will heat up even more when the Druids of the Flame light up the Mini-Set (releasing earlier than normal this year, during the 32.2 Patch). The second expansion of the year will be Hearthstone’s first-ever sequel: the return to Un’Goro Crater! Join Elise on a hunt for a mythical, lost Tortollan city. When you find it, join the Tortollans in a festival to celebrate the mighty dinosaurs of the crater in the 33.4 Mini-Set. In the third expansion of the year, travel with Chromie through alternate realities to recruit Legendary Warcraft heroes like you’ve never seen them before. Leading to the 34.4 Mini-Set: an epic showdown against Murozond at the end of time! It’s been one year since Warcraft Rumble went live. To celebrate, players can log in to Warcraft Rumble today and join the one-year anniversary celebration in game. Players can collect daily rewards, including new avatars and cosmetics! The Warcraft universe is built on rich and diverse characters that may not fit into any singular family, and because of this, we’re introducing split Leaders! In Season 10, we reintroduce Sylvanas Windrunner as the first playable split Leader, honoring her allegiance to both the Horde and Undead families. Later, we will introduce Malfurion Stormrage as Alliance and Cenarion, Orgrim Doomhammer as Horde and Blackrock, and last but not least, Anub’arak as Undead and Beast. Warcraft Rumble is coming to PC! The PC beta will launch on December 10, 2024; stay tuned for more information! World of Warcraft celebrates 20 years of adventure in Azeroth, bringing together players of all ages and abilities from all over the world, making connections both in the game and out. Inspired by the incredible story captured in “The Remarkable Life of Ibelin” documentary about Mats “Ibelin” Steen—now live on Netflix— a Norwegian WoW® player who suffered from Duchenne muscular dystrophy, you can add the Reven Pack to your collection and support CureDuchenne, a nonprofit organization dedicated to improving and extending the lives of those affected by this disease. Live now in modern World of Warcraft, players can join the World of Warcraft 20th Anniversary Celebration to collect updated Tier 2 armor appearance sets, undertake Classic Timewalking, engage with others to defeat iconic world bosses, head to the Trading post, and earn iconic new rewards, and more. The War Within has taken the leap into the first chapter of the Worldsoul Saga and adventures continue in WoW Classic, but this is only the beginning of what we have planned. Currently, in Season of Discovery, players are exploring new adventures with new class abilities, all-new level-up raids, finding secrets, and teaming up to defeat Ragnaros and Nefarian. It won’t be long until everyone can join the War Effort and open the gates to Ahn’Qiraj, where they’ll get to plunder the depths for new rewards and face new challenges. After Ahn’Qiraj, players in Season of Discovery can look forward to one more phase, in which they’ll face the dangers of Naxxramas, along with new instanced content featuring the Scarlet Crusade as well as adventures in Deadwind Pass! In Cataclysm Classic, Ragnaros has risen in the Firelands once more, and players are working toward adding the Dragonwrath Staff to their collection. In the final phase of Cataclysm Classic, players will experience the Hour of Twilight patch and Dragon Soul raid dungeon early next year. And that’s not all we have in store for Classic World of Warcraft. We’re pleased to announce that Mists of Pandaria Classic will be arriving in the summer of 2025, taking players back to the shores of Pandaria and bringing its legendary class design, incredible raids and dungeons, stunning environments, and (of course) an unforgettable soundtrack. Relive the World of Warcraft Classic experience with all-new fresh realms in the WoW Classic 20th Anniversary Edition arriving November 21. Join players on a whole new journey to level 60, with the first raid dungeon, Molten Core, becoming available a few weeks after launch. Choose to play on a PvP realm, a Normal PvE realm, or (for the very first time) a Hardcore realm progressing through content with the other realms — all from the beginning, with fresh economies, on very large realms. These realms will launch with some of the quality-of-life features that came later in the WoW Classic cycle, such as the Chronoboon Displacer to save your world buffs and the improved PvP Honor Ranking system. The PvP and Normal PvE realms will also progress into Burning Crusade Classic! It's never too late to go back and re-experience World of Warcraft anew—just in time to celebrate 20 years of adventures in Azeroth! The first chapter of the Worldsoul Saga kicked off in August with the launch of The War Within, bringing with it myriad new experiences with a new raid, dungeons, delves, PvP, new appearances and rewards, pets, mounts and much more. On the horizon, our next content update, Siren Isle, is currently available on the Public Test Realms (PTR), and the update will go live next month with a little something for everyone. This update also includes the epilogue questline for Dalaran and the Kirin Tor. No spoilers, but the storyline will feature the mysterious haranir, who also starred in the expansion release cinematic. The Siren Isle introduces a new outdoor environment to explore, full of mysteries to uncover and rewards to help catch your alternate characters up and prepare for the next War Within season ahead. Plunderstorm is returning with a new Plunderstore to provide more flexibility for earning rewards instead of a linear Renown track. There are also some quality-of-life changes to spell interactions, the UI and more ahead. The Siren Isle content update also brings with it Turbulent Timeways once more and additional updates to the Feast of Winter Veil in-game holiday event. We’re introducing a new novella that explores more of the story behind the scenes. Find out what happened with Jaina and Thrall after the Fall of Dalaran as they seek out reinforcements in this five-chapter special— available today and as read by Chris Metzen! Listen and read here. Xal’atath’s trail leads adventurers to a location in our next major content update that has long been known about but, as yet, remained unexplored—the Undermine. Players will travel deep into the goblin city of Undermine, the capital of the goblin’s trade empire! It is a city like none other seen before in World of Warcraft and stands as a testament to goblin intelligence and creativity as experts in both technology and alchemy. As our adventures continue, we’ll learn more about goblin culture and society that we have never been able to see before. We’ll learn what’s important to them, the problems they are trying to solve —everything that makes them truly unique, and what they’re capable of as a society. We’ll dig a bit deeper beyond just their humor and explosions, though there will still be explosions and a LOT of mayhem to be found. You’ll arrive in an Undermine that’s in conflict between the four major goblin cartels: Steamwheedle, Blackwater, Bilgewater, and the Venture Company. Each cartel is run by notorious goblins like Monte Gazlowe, Renzik “The Shiv,” Baron Revilgaz, Marin Noggenfogger, and more. Which one you align yourself with is up to you. You’ll want to make sure you have a sweet ride to roll around town in— players can earn a customizable vehicle early on that’s designed just for use in Undermine. You’ll push the boundaries of locomotion on the roads of Undermine and speed through its causeways and byways at a higher rate than a ground mount can. Players can adjust the car’s driving characteristics by adding a little extra grip to hug the roads or adjust to slide and glide as they drift around corners. Want to accelerate faster? Then, you may have to sacrifice a little speed. How you customize your car’s characteristics is up to you. The new dungeon, Operation: Floodgate, builds on the narrative of Undermine as players race to stop a group of goblins from blowing a dam that will bring ruin to the Ringing Deeps. This new dungeon will be available immediately as a part of the new The War Within Season 2 dungeon pool on Heroic, Mythic, and Mythic+, alongside the four other launch dungeons and three legacy dungeons. We’ll share more information on the full slate of dungeons at a later point, but we would be remiss if we didn’t include MOTHERLODE from Battle for Azeroth in the rotation. Players will also experience two new Delves and variations of existing Delves in the content update. Seasonal updates are also being introduced to Brann Bronzebeard, a new adversary to follow, Zek’vir, and a new set of goblin-inspired Curios. Experience a new 8-boss raid dungeon that takes you through the city streets and into the magnificent Gallagio— brimming with color and extravagance, it houses the dark secrets of its owner— Gallywix. There’s more at play here than it first seems, and goblin politics are treacherous and fraught with the underpinnings of something more where Xal’atath is concerned. There’s even more ahead in 2025, and we have the roadmaps to help guide you on what you can look forward to in World of Warcraft and WoW Classic. Thank you for making Azeroth your home over these last two decades. Speaking of home, the World of Warcraft team has one last thing to share with you… And yes, in World of Warcraft: Midnight, your next adventure begins at home. A house to call your very own. Stay tuned! Wherever your gaming experience takes you, we can’t wait to continue on this journey with you all. Lok’tar ogar! We’ll see you at the Inn, in Azeroth, and wherever the road takes us all next!

Title: How Vivek Ramaswamy Became A Billionaire
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnhyatt/2024/11/13/how-vivek-ramaswamy-became-a-billionaire/
Time Published: 2024-11-13T19:39:20Z
Full Content:
UPDATE, November 13, 2024: On November 12, a week after Donald Trump won the presidential election, he named billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy as co-heads of a new entity, the Department of Government Efficiency. Already nicknamed DOGE, it is tasked with cutting wasteful expenditures, slashing excessive regulations and restructuring federal agencies. “This is truly a once-in-a-century opportunity. We will be radically transparent about the government waste we uncover,” Ramaswamy posted on X on Thursday, November 13. Here’s the inside story—first published by Forbes in August 2023—on how Ramaswamy, the lesser known and less rich Musk counterpart, made his own billion-dollar fortune. Standing in a packed New Hampshire restaurant, Vivek Ramaswamy, the fresh-faced Republican shaking up the 2024 presidential race, is making a case for unifying a bitterly divided nation. The secret, he insists, is as American as apple pie: capitalism. “Democrats and Republicans alike, we tend to be more proud of a country when we’re all making more money in that country,” he tells 100 or so diners enjoying turkey sandwiches and diet Cokes. “We don’t have to flog ourselves for capitalism. Stop apologizing for capitalism. We should embrace capitalism.” Ramaswamy certainly has. At 38 years old, the biotech investor and “anti-woke” warrior is worth more than $950 million. His net worth was over $1 billion about a week ago, making him one of the 20 youngest billionaires in the country, before a downturn in the market pulled him just under the billion-dollar threshold, according to Forbes’ calculations. Still, he appears to be the second-wealthiest person competing in the Republican presidential primary, behind only Donald Trump (whose net worth Forbes last pegged at $2.5 billion). Ramawamy’s fortune stems from a drug-development company named Roivant Sciences, which went public in 2021. Its stock is up nearly 40% this year, boosting the value of Ramaswamy’s 10% stake to roughly $600 million. Since founding the company nine years ago, he has sucked over $260 million out of Roivant in the form of salary, bonuses and capital gains. He diversified those proceeds into a pretty standard investment portfolio, roughly 60% stocks and 40% bonds. But he also added some flavor, with a dash of Bitcoin and Ethereum, some shares of YouTube competitor Rumble and a stake in crypto payments firm MoonPay. Then there are his political interests. In 2021, Ramaswamy stepped down as CEO of Roivant and got into politics, authoring a book called “Woke, Inc.,” which criticized corporate America’s growing focus on social justice issues and the ESG (environmental, social and governance) movement taking over Wall Street. A year later, he founded an “anti-woke” index fund provider—think BlackRock, without all the talk about saving the world—named Strive Asset Management. Investors recently valued Strive at a lofty $300 million or so, according to two individuals familiar with the financing, implying that Ramaswamy’s stake is worth well over $100 million. It’s a lot of money to make in a little amount of time. The son of Indian immigrants—Ramaswamy’s father an engineer and patent attorney, his mother a psychiatrist—he attended Harvard, where he studied biology and cofounded StudentBusinesses.com, a website for student founders to pitch professional investors. A private charity reportedly bought the company in 2009 for an undisclosed sum. After graduating, Ramaswamy joined the hedge fund QVT, where he specialized in pharmaceutical investments. He earned $7 million in the first seven years of his career and made partner by 28. Around the same time, he met his now-wife, Apoorva, a throat surgeon. While continuing to work, he also managed to get a degree from America’s most prestigious law school, Yale. Ramaswamy left his job at QVT at 29 and, with the hedge fund backing him, started an investment holding company named Roivant Sciences. His thesis: Pharma giants had plenty of abandoned drugs that could be worth a fortune if someone focused on them. One year after founding the company, one of Roivant’s spinoffs, named Axovant, went public at a $2.2 billion valuation. Its prized asset: a much-hyped Alzheimer’s drug candidate, Intepirdine, which Ramaswamy had purchased for just $5 million. The year that Axovant joined the New York Stock Exchange, Ramaswamy reported more than $38 million of income, most of it from capital gains, on his tax return. Intepirdine turned out to be a disappointment, failing a clinical trial two years later. The company rebranded as Sio Gene Therapies in 2020 and is now worth about $30 million. But Ramaswamy had other drugs, too. In 2020, Japanese pharma giant Sumitomo Dainippon paid $3 billion to acquire five of them, as well as a 10% stake in Roivant. Ramaswamy got his second big windfall that year, reporting $176 million of income on his tax return, including $174.5 million in capital gains. Flush with cash, Ramaswamy stepped down from his company in January 2021, citing his “increasing public engagement” in a note to shareholders. He published his book seven months later and started the “anti-woke” asset management firm, Strive, around the same time. “We stand for this movement that we call ‘excellence capitalism,’ as a counterpart to stakeholder capitalism,” Ramaswamy explained on the Trillions podcast. “What excellence capitalism says is, focus exclusively on delivering excellent products and services to your customers, above all other agendas, including political and social agendas. And that’s different from stakeholder capitalism, which says you’re supposed to take into account 12 or 20 stakeholders at the same time.” A lineup of serious investors bankrolled Strive. Mega-donor Peter Thiel, who backed other “anti-woke” ventures like Rumble, put in some money. So did hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman, who has invested heavily in the pharmaceutical industry and connected with Ramaswamy playing tennis. Joe Lonsdale, the 40-year-old cofounder of Palantir, chipped in, too. Despite all his money and connections, Ramaswamy looks pretty comfortable doing meet-and-greet politicking in New Hampshire. It helps, he says, that he doesn’t live like a tycoon. “I don’t think we have lived a lifestyle that is radically removed from the one we grew up in.” He owns two Ohio homes worth a combined $2.5 million, less than the real estate portfolios of far-less-wealthy candidates, including Nikki Haley, Francis Suarez, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and President Joe Biden. “We don’t have giant vacation homes,” Ramaswamy says. “We see five of our neighbors’ backyards. We have good relationships with our neighbors.” The exception, he concedes, is private air travel. He owns stakes in three private jets, which allows him to hop-scotch across the country and still make it back home to spend time with his wife and two young children in Ohio. “If we could buy time, we would buy time,” he says. “And that’s the only thing private aviation buys us. Time with family.” Voters seem to recognize that Ramaswamy inhabits a different stratosphere. In Milford, an older woman thanked him for visiting “us cow-town people” in New Hampshire. “Oh c’mon,” the billionaire presidential candidate responded, looking a little embarrassed. “I’m one of you.” He’s not, of course. Which is part of the appeal.

After Ahn’Qiraj, players in Season of Discovery can look forward to one more phase, in which they’ll face the dangers of Naxxramas, along with new instanced content featuring the Scarlet Crusade as well as adventures in Deadwind Pass! In Cataclysm Classic, Ragnaros has risen in the Firelands once more, and players are working toward adding the Dragonwrath Staff to their collection. In the final phase of Cataclysm Classic, players will experience the Hour of Twilight patch and Dragon Soul raid dungeon early next year. And that’s not all we have in store for Classic World of Warcraft. We’re pleased to announce that Mists of Pandaria Classic will be arriving in the summer of 2025, taking players back to the shores of Pandaria and bringing its legendary class design, incredible raids and dungeons, stunning environments, and (of course) an unforgettable soundtrack. Relive the World of Warcraft Classic experience with all-new fresh realms in the WoW Classic 20th Anniversary Edition arriving November 21. Join players on a whole new journey to level 60, with the first raid dungeon, Molten Core, becoming available a few weeks after launch. Choose to play on a PvP realm, a Normal PvE realm, or (for the very first time) a Hardcore realm progressing through content with the other realms — all from the beginning, with fresh economies, on very large realms. These realms will launch with some of the quality-of-life features that came later in the WoW Classic cycle, such as the Chronoboon Displacer to save your world buffs and the improved PvP Honor Ranking system. The PvP and Normal PvE realms will also progress into Burning Crusade Classic! It's never too late to go back and re-experience World of Warcraft anew—just in time to celebrate 20 years of adventures in Azeroth! The first chapter of the Worldsoul Saga kicked off in August with the launch of The War Within, bringing with it myriad new experiences with a new raid, dungeons, delves, PvP, new appearances and rewards, pets, mounts and much more. On the horizon, our next content update, Siren Isle, is currently available on the Public Test Realms (PTR), and the update will go live next month with a little something for everyone. This update also includes the epilogue questline for Dalaran and the Kirin Tor. No spoilers, but the storyline will feature the mysterious haranir, who also starred in the expansion release cinematic. The Siren Isle introduces a new outdoor environment to explore, full of mysteries to uncover and rewards to help catch your alternate characters up and prepare for the next War Within season ahead. Plunderstorm is returning with a new Plunderstore to provide more flexibility for earning rewards instead of a linear Renown track. There are also some quality-of-life changes to spell interactions, the UI and more ahead. The Siren Isle content update also brings with it Turbulent Timeways once more and additional updates to the Feast of Winter Veil in-game holiday event. We’re introducing a new novella that explores more of the story behind the scenes. Find out what happened with Jaina and Thrall after the Fall of Dalaran as they seek out reinforcements in this five-chapter special— available today and as read by Chris Metzen! Listen and read here. Xal’atath’s trail leads adventurers to a location in our next major content update that has long been known about but, as yet, remained unexplored—the Undermine. Players will travel deep into the goblin city of Undermine, the capital of the goblin’s trade empire! It is a city like none other seen before in World of Warcraft and stands as a testament to goblin intelligence and creativity as experts in both technology and alchemy. As our adventures continue, we’ll learn more about goblin culture and society that we have never been able to see before. We’ll learn what’s important to them, the problems they are trying to solve —everything that makes them truly unique, and what they’re capable of as a society. We’ll dig a bit deeper beyond just their humor and explosions, though there will still be explosions and a LOT of mayhem to be found. You’ll arrive in an Undermine that’s in conflict between the four major goblin cartels: Steamwheedle, Blackwater, Bilgewater, and the Venture Company. Each cartel is run by notorious goblins like Monte Gazlowe, Renzik “The Shiv,” Baron Revilgaz, Marin Noggenfogger, and more. Which one you align yourself with is up to you. You’ll want to make sure you have a sweet ride to roll around town in— players can earn a customizable vehicle early on that’s designed just for use in Undermine. You’ll push the boundaries of locomotion on the roads of Undermine and speed through its causeways and byways at a higher rate than a ground mount can. Players can adjust the car’s driving characteristics by adding a little extra grip to hug the roads or adjust to slide and glide as they drift around corners. Want to accelerate faster? Then, you may have to sacrifice a little speed. How you customize your car’s characteristics is up to you. The new dungeon, Operation: Floodgate, builds on the narrative of Undermine as players race to stop a group of goblins from blowing a dam that will bring ruin to the Ringing Deeps. This new dungeon will be available immediately as a part of the new The War Within Season 2 dungeon pool on Heroic, Mythic, and Mythic+, alongside the four other launch dungeons and three legacy dungeons. We’ll share more information on the full slate of dungeons at a later point, but we would be remiss if we didn’t include MOTHERLODE from Battle for Azeroth in the rotation. Players will also experience two new Delves and variations of existing Delves in the content update. Seasonal updates are also being introduced to Brann Bronzebeard, a new adversary to follow, Zek’vir, and a new set of goblin-inspired Curios. Experience a new 8-boss raid dungeon that takes you through the city streets and into the magnificent Gallagio— brimming with color and extravagance, it houses the dark secrets of its owner— Gallywix. There’s more at play here than it first seems, and goblin politics are treacherous and fraught with the underpinnings of something more where Xal’atath is concerned. There’s even more ahead in 2025, and we have the roadmaps to help guide you on what you can look forward to in World of Warcraft and WoW Classic. Thank you for making Azeroth your home over these last two decades. Speaking of home, the World of Warcraft team has one last thing to share with you… And yes, in World of Warcraft: Midnight, your next adventure begins at home. A house to call your very own. Stay tuned! Wherever your gaming experience takes you, we can’t wait to continue on this journey with you all. Lok’tar ogar! We’ll see you at the Inn, in Azeroth, and wherever the road takes us all next!

It’s a big year for the Warcraft universe, and whether you’re a Hearthstone fan, you’ve joined the chaos in Warcraft Rumble, ventured into the world of Azeroth for the first time in Warcraft: Orcs and Humans, or you’re a World of Warcraft player, there’s something for everyone in our Warcraft 30th Anniversary Direct stream. Join us for a celebration as we dip into the mana pool of nostalgia and cast far sight on the future of all things Warcraft. Viewers can watch on any Warcraft, Hearthstone, or Warcraft Rumble stream on Twitch or TikTok to earn rewards during the giveaway period from November 13 at 10:00 am PST through December 11 at 10:00 am PST. Learn more in our previously published article. We’ve rounded up everything you need to know from the Warcraft 30th Anniversary Direct here. Jump directly to each section to learn more: Warcraft RTS, Hearthstone, Warcraft Rumble, World of Warcraft, World of Warcraft Classic, World of Warcraft: The War Within. It’s been 30 years since Warcraft: Orcs and Humans made its debut, setting the path for so many stories and adventures that have come after. To continue these adventures in the Warcraft series, we’ve released Patch 2.0— now available for all Warcraft III: Reforged players. The patch overhauls environments, lighting, and the user interface. It also introduces uprezzed classic Warcraft III assets to HD, allowing players to choose and customize their graphical experience. Mix and match assets as you wish. There are also new quality-of-life improvements such as in-game hotkey customization, updated ladder, and much much more. Beyond the update for Warcraft III: Reforged, we’re happy to announce the release of fully remastered versions of Warcraft I and Warcraft II, taking you beyond Orcs and Humans, the Tides of Darkness, and the Dark Portal for the first time, again. Players will be able to switch between the original graphics and the remastered versions in real time. We’ve also added more modern controls to Warcraft I, such as right-click move, band box select, and faster game speed. Both Warcraft I and II also have UI and UX improvements, such as tooltips and health bars, a mission select screen, and increased unit selection. Warcraft II will continue to have multiplayer functionality, and all legacy custom maps will remain fully compatible and playable. Travel back in time to experience each of these titles once more or— for the very first time— by visiting the shop: Warcraft I: Remastered, Warcraft II: Remastered, Warcraft III: Reforged. You’ll never forget the first time you hear “zug zug.” We’ve also brought back the Battle Chest, allowing players to purchase all three games in one bundle. For those who already purchased Warcraft: Orcs & Humans, Warcraft®: II Battle.net® edition, or Warcraft III: Reforged from the Battle.net shop, the bundle will be available at a discount. Early next year, Hearthstone is going beyond Warcraft and into... Heroes of StarCraft! This special Mini-Set will have a whopping 49 new cards across three themed factions, which show what the StarCraft universe would look like in the Hearthstone Tavern. Each faction is made up of cards that can be used across multiple classes, including an iconic Hero card. Zerg Death Knight, Demon Hunter, Hunter, and Warlock have joined the Zerg! Led by the formidable Sarah Kerrigan, they will have aggressive cards that win the game by swarming the board. Protoss Druid, Mage, Priest, and Rogue fight for the Protoss Empire. Led by the High Templar Artanis, they will have powerful, high-cost cards that are made cheaper throughout the game. Terran Paladin, Shaman, and Warrior make up the Terran forces, lead by the one and only Jim Raynor. They will command Battlecruisers—a special take on the Starship mechanic from The Great Dark Beyond. The Mini-Set will feature a slew of StarCraft units which are sure to invoke nostalgia, as well as the Terran-armored Murloc, Grunty, and new, thematic music. You can chart a course for the Heroes of StarCraft Mini-Set, launching in January 2025! More announcements, details, and card reveals are coming closer to launch. Then, for the first time in 10 years, Arena Mode is getting a major overhaul. With that update, there will be two kinds of Arena to choose from. Normal Arena will be shorter form, allowing you to complete your runs more quickly. Competitive Arena players will be able to play in the higher-stakes Underground Arena, with longer runs and a new feature: Re-Draft on Loss. Re-Draft on Loss means that, after you lose, you’ll have the option to re-draft cards, edit your deck, and keep your run alive. Ratings will also be added to both Normal and Underground Arena. Normal, skill-based matchmaking will be used for Normal Arena. Underground Arena throws caution to the wind and lets you face off against opponents of all skill levels. This major Arena revamp is coming in the first half of next year. Look out for more details about this update closer to when it goes live. On top of those updates, Hearthstone has an exciting year of expansions ahead, with much-requested themes, locations, and familiar faces across Azeroth. In the first expansion of the year, enter the Emerald Dream and join the battle between the Old Gods and the Druids of the Emerald Dream for the fate of the World Tree. Things will heat up even more when the Druids of the Flame light up the Mini-Set (releasing earlier than normal this year, during the 32.2 Patch). The second expansion of the year will be Hearthstone’s first-ever sequel: the return to Un’Goro Crater! Join Elise on a hunt for a mythical, lost Tortollan city. When you find it, join the Tortollans in a festival to celebrate the mighty dinosaurs of the crater in the 33.4 Mini-Set. In the third expansion of the year, travel with Chromie through alternate realities to recruit Legendary Warcraft heroes like you’ve never seen them before. Leading to the 34.4 Mini-Set: an epic showdown against Murozond at the end of time! It’s been one year since Warcraft Rumble went live. To celebrate, players can log in to Warcraft Rumble today and join the one-year anniversary celebration in game. Players can collect daily rewards, including new avatars and cosmetics! The Warcraft universe is built on rich and diverse characters that may not fit into any singular family, and because of this, we’re introducing split Leaders! In Season 10, we reintroduce Sylvanas Windrunner as the first playable split Leader, honoring her allegiance to both the Horde and Undead families. Later, we will introduce Malfurion Stormrage as Alliance and Cenarion, Orgrim Doomhammer as Horde and Blackrock, and last but not least, Anub’arak as Undead and Beast. Warcraft Rumble is coming to PC! The PC beta will launch on December 10, 2024; stay tuned for more information! World of Warcraft celebrates 20 years of adventure in Azeroth, bringing together players of all ages and abilities from all over the world, making connections both in the game and out. Inspired by the incredible story captured in “The Remarkable Life of Ibelin” documentary about Mats “Ibelin” Steen—now live on Netflix— a Norwegian WoW® player who suffered from Duchenne muscular dystrophy, you can add the Reven Pack to your collection and support CureDuchenne, a nonprofit organization dedicated to improving and extending the lives of those affected by this disease. Live now in modern World of Warcraft, players can join the World of Warcraft 20th Anniversary Celebration to collect updated Tier 2 armor appearance sets, undertake Classic Timewalking, engage with others to defeat iconic world bosses, head to the Trading post, and earn iconic new rewards, and more. The War Within has taken the leap into the first chapter of the Worldsoul Saga and adventures continue in WoW Classic, but this is only the beginning of what we have planned. Currently, in Season of Discovery, players are exploring new adventures with new class abilities, all-new level-up raids, finding secrets, and teaming up to defeat Ragnaros and Nefarian. It won’t be long until everyone can join the War Effort and open the gates to Ahn’Qiraj, where they’ll get to plunder the depths for new rewards and face new challenges.

The investment manager said Wednesday that its USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) is now available to investors on the Aptos; Arbitrum; Avalanche; OP Mainnet, formerly known as Optimism; and Polygon blockchains. It initially launched the fund on Ethereum in March. The BUIDL fund, which BlackRock debuted two months after iShares Bitcoin Trust, its popular bitcoin exchange-traded fund, gives investors an opportunity to earn U.S. dollar yields through a blockchain-based vehicle. The idea of tokenizing "real world assets" such as gold, a key aspect of decentralized finance, or DeFi, has gained popularity among financial institutions that are cautious on crypto assets but keen on the underlying blockchain technology. "There's some irony in the fact that with … [iShares Bitcoin Trust], we took a crypto native investment exposure and we put it in a traditional finance wrapper … and with tokenization, we're taking traditional finance investment exposure, and we're putting it in a crypto native wrapper," Robert Mitchnick, BlackRock's head of digital assets, said in March. "That dichotomy will persist for a while," he added at the time. "But eventually, we expect there will be some convergence that looks like the best of the old system and the best of this new technology fused into a next generation infrastructure set in finance." The BUIDL fund is tokenized by Securitize, a company BlackRock has invested in that specializes in the tokenization of real-world assets. The announcement follows a weeklong rally in cryptocurrencies after Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential election. Polygon's token climbed 28%, according to Coin Metrics. On the campaign trail, Trump promised more supportive regulations for crypto projects and businesses, a reversal from Biden administration policy, in which the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has largely regulated the industry through enforcement actions, hampering growth. DeFi is one of the most popular sectors among crypto market participants but has suffered from the lack of regulatory clarity, with tokens of some DeFi projects being classified as securities in SEC lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase last year.

Title: Ireland v Argentina: Robbie Henshaw takes over from Bundee Aki in only change to starting XV
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2024/11/13/ireland-v-argentina-robbie-henshaw-takes-over-from-bundee-aki-in-only-change-to-starting-xv/
Time Published: 2024-11-13T17:17:08Z
Full Content:
Andy Farrell has made only one change to the Ireland starting XV for this Friday’s Autumn Nations Series encounter against Argentina at the Aviva Stadium (kick-off 8.10pm) by recalling Robbie Henshaw to midfield. But there are four changes on the bench, including two prospective debutants in Thomas Clarkson and Sam Prendergast, as well as recalls for Ryan Baird and Craig Casey. Henshaw is reunited with his Leinster midfield partner Garry Ringrose in place of Bundee Aki, who misses out on the matchday squad altogether, as Farrell reverts to the combination he employed for the second Test victory over South Africa in Durban last July. The rest of the starting XV from last Friday’s 23-13 defeat by the All Blacks has been retained, with Farrell also opting for the pack which started in Kings Park when Tadhg Beirne shifted from the secondrow to blindside, save for the injured Tadhg Furlong. Not surprisingly, the latter has not been risked after aggravating a hamstring injury in Ireland’s preparatory camp in Portugal. And with Tom O’Toole obliged to undergo the 12-day return to play protocols after suffering a head injury within two minutes of his introduction against New Zealand, it means Clarkson is set to make his debut from the bench. The 24-year-old from Wicklow came through Blackrock College and was an ever-present on the Ireland Under-20 Grand Slam-winning side in 2019. Although officially named as one of the additional ‘training panellists’ when the squad was announced, he is now in line for his Test debut after winning 47 caps for Leinster. By contrast, Prendergast is only 21 yet his coronation as a Test player has been inevitable since he provided the stardust as outhalf on the 2023 Ireland Under-20 Grand Slam-winning team which also reached the Junior World Cup final. Such has been Farrell’s evident admiration for Prendergast’s repertoire of passing and kicking skills that he was called in as a training panellist for last year’s Six Nations, was brought on the tour to South Africa and started all three games on this season’s Emerging Ireland tour to the same country. His promotion comes at the expense of Ciarán Frawley, who has experienced the fickle nature of sport after his match-winning heroics in Durban, while Baird and Casey are preferred to Iain Henderson and Conor Murray. Farrell said that the selection was with “the balance of the right team to play this game” in mind, as in “achieving a performance and keeping the squad ticking over at the same time”. The head coach admitted he could have made more changes based solely on the evidence of last week, but reasoned that it was better to give players such as Jack Crowley another chance. “Jack, along with quite a few of our players, would have been hoping for better performance. Some of them are lucky enough to get another chance to do that others are coming in and some of them played pretty well themselves, but there were too many people not right at their best last week and we’re hoping for everyone to improve, not just Jack. “Obviously, the control of the game is something that Jack would be open and honest about of wanting to step up a little bit this weekend but we’ve certainly seen that in training this week.” As for his new understudy, Farrell said of Prendergast: “He’s ready. For a young fellah that’s not had much game-time provincially, he’s obviously had more of late, but in an ironic way he’s probably been patient enough. “Because, in his own mind he’d probably thought he’s been ready for quite some time because he’s that kind of kid, a confident kid. The experience that he’s got from being around the squad, he’s comfortable in his own skin. “The reason for taking him on the Emerging tour was to make sure that he understood what it was to grab hold of his team and show that he is in charge. He showed that in abundance, we’ve seen the knock-on effect from that in the squad in the last couple of weeks. “In his own mind he’s ready. He’s a young kid that’s in a pressurised-type position obviously. He’s going to make his mistakes, but that’s the nature of anyone coming through.” Improvement was needed in every area, Farrell admitted, but he maintained that being an honest group made it easier to find solutions and he welcomed the additional pressure now on this team to perform after coming up short. “Pressure’s good. It’s what concentrates the mind, you see where your character’s at. We want to win all our games, but the opposition is always going to have a say in that. I think this is perfect because we’ve got another top, top drawer opposition coming and we want to test ourselves because we feel like we let a few people down last week. “It’s the best medicine for you actually, to get back on the horse, I’m sure there’s a bit of disappointment with a few of the lads that they don’t get to do that but they understand as well that it’s about the team, it’s about the squad but, yeah, and that’s why I said it’s the perfect game because it’s very similar insofar as the quality of the opposition and where you need to be to draw out that performance from yourselves.” IRELAND (v Argentina): Hugo Keenan (Leinster); Mack Hansen (Connacht), Garry Ringrose (Leinster), Robbie Henshaw (Leinster), James Lowe (Leinster); Jack Crowley (Munster), Jamison Gibson-Park (Leinster); Andrew Porter (Leinster), Rónan Kelleher (Leinster), Finlay Bealham (Connacht); Joe McCarthy (Leinster), James Ryan (Leinster); Tadhg Beirne (Munster); Josh van der Flier (Leinster), Caelan Doris (Leinster, capt). Replacements: Rob Herring (Ulster), Cian Healy (Leinster), Thomas Clarkson (Leinster)*, Ryan Baird (Leinster); Peter O’Mahony (Munster), Craig Casey (Munster), Sam Prendergast (Leinster)*, Jamie Osborne (Leinster). * denotes uncapped player.

In the transaction, CoreWeave's existing stakeholders are selling shares to outside investors. Bloomberg reported last month that CoreWeave was targeting a $23 billion valuation for the deal, up from $19 billion in a $1.1 billion investment round announced in May. CoreWeave is going head-to-head with large cloud infrastructure providers, such as Amazon and Google in providing Nvidia's graphics processing units, or GPUs, to companies for AI workloads. The startup got a big boost last year, when Nvidia made an investment, and another stamp of approval after Microsoft enlisted the company as a third-party cloud provider. Investors have been eager to sink money into companies that are enabling generative AI, which can create text, images and videos in response to a few words of human input. The frenzy began after Microsoft-backed OpenAI's ChatGPT went viral in late 2022 and led to soaring demand for compute power. "We are a company that is one of the few companies in the world that's able to bring on this kind of infrastructure at the scale that's required to actually make a difference," CoreWeave co-founder and CEO Mike Intrator told CNBC's "Squawk Box" in July. The following month Nvidia said its H200 GPUs had become available through CoreWeave, meaning the startup was the first cloud provider to reach general availability with the graphics cards. CoreWeave has raised $14 billion, a spokesperson said. In May, the company said it had raised $7.5 billion in fresh debt. In October, it announced a $650 million credit line. Last week, bitcoin mining company Core Scientific said CoreWeave had signed up for 500 megawatts worth of data center capacity in a deal that could be worth up to $8.7 billion over 12 years. In addition to Cisco and Pure, investment firms including BlackRock, Coatue and Fidelity participated in CoreWeave's secondary sale.

Title: ‘Recipe for Ethereum to reach $10K’ – How ETFs can help ETH soar

Bankless’ co-founder believes that buy pressure on ETH from ETFs has yet to materialize. On the 12th of November, Ethereum [ETH] ETFs broke new ground, finally tipping total net flows into positive territory—for the first time since their launch. Source: SoSo Value Data from SoSo Value revealed a daily net inflow of $135.92 million, pushing cumulative inflows to $94.62 million. Trading activity also ramped up, with a total value of $582.18 million traded and total net assets climbing to $9.67 billion. Of the nine ETFs, five saw inflows. Meanwhile, only Grayscale Ethereum Trust [ETHE] recorded outflows, with the remaining funds showing no new inflows. The latest development caught the attention of industry leaders on X (formerly twitter). Nate Geraci, President of the ETF Store, highlighted the net positive flows mark a significant milestone for ETH ETFs given they have, “Overcome $3.2bil in outflows from ETHE.” Additionally, Geraci pointed out that 19 of the top 50 ETF launches this year are linked to Bitcoin [BTC], ETH, or MicroStrategy, with 12 among the top 18—an impressive figure out of 610 total launches. Furthermore, iShares’ Ethereum Trust [ETHA] ranked as the 6th top ETF launch of 2024 Bankless co-founder Ryan Sean Adams also commented on the development. He noted that ETHE’s dominant outflows essentially offset any upward pressure from ETFs. However, as inflows turn positive for the first time, this might signal a shift. Adams even forecasted that this shift is a “Recipe for an ETH rocket to $10k.” This latest milestone comes a day after the ETFs experienced a record-breaking day on 11th November, registering $295 million in inflows. This influx, led by industry giants like Fidelity and BlackRock, marked nearly triple the previous peak of $106.6 million recorded on launch day. Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst, noted on X that ETFs were, “Trending in right direction.” The analyst further anticipated a positive trend for the ETFs, stating, “Sunny days ahead, although still several country miles behind BTC ETFs.” Meanwhile, BTC ETFs also hit a record of their own. Balchunas revealed on X that Bitcoin ETFs crossed the $90 billion mark in assets under management, following a substantial $6 billion increase. This comprised $1 billion in new inflows and $5 billion in market appreciation. This surge means that Bitcoin ETFs were now 72% of the way toward surpassing gold ETFs in total assets. Source: Eric Balchunas/X In a further sign of demand, IBIT reached $1 billion in trading volume within just 25 minutes—faster than the previous day, when it went on to break an all-time record. Balchunas described the sustained interest in BTC ETFs as a “feeding frenzy” that shows no signs of slowing down.

Title: Are You Not Entertained

Bad shots and deep thoughts on the pickleball courts, mini golf courses, and axe-throwing pitches of the new eatertainment If you buy something from an Eater link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics policy. I learned too late that axe throwing is a serious game — in my mind it had always been a concept; a bit of lumberjack cosplay. But there I was at Smash Park in suburban Roseville, Minnesota, knee-deep in an arduous lunge, arcing a dull-edged hatchet behind my head; eyes narrowed. To my left, our assigned coach, Wolfgang, was lunging beside me, rocking back and forth in his fat-tongued hiking boots, demonstrating the art of a devastating throw. My axe hit the outer rings of the bullseye, a red-and-white screen image projected onto a sensor-calibrated plywood board. My avatar, a lion wearing a red flannel shirt, flashed onto the screen: two points. Smash Park offers far more than axe throwing: At 30,000 square feet, it’s a multiplex of duckpin bowling, party darts, shuffleboard, karaoke, cornhole, and pickleball. It’s one of the emergent brands in the “eatertainment” sector, a growing category of venues that offer both entertainment and (variably) restaurant-caliber food: Smash Park, for example, distinguishes itself from bowling alley burgers and the like with considered dishes like Frito pie, barbecue sampler platters, and Bang Bang Shrimp. Eatertainment has taken off nationally in the past few years, and in the Twin Cities, it’s having somewhat of a hyper-local boom: In the past year and a half, we’ve welcomed Smash Park; Puttery, a labyrinthine, adults-only mini-golf bar in the North Loop; and now Puttshack, a high-tech mini-golf complex freshly open in Edina, with another planned for Minneapolis. It’s a fair bet that more will follow: Eatertainment brands from Dave & Buster’s to Chicken N Pickle to Pinstripes are rapidly expanding, reshaping our eating, drinking, and entertainment landscapes as they inch toward ubiquity. Smash Park’s flagship is in Des Moines, Iowa. Its founder, Monty Lockyear, is a former marketing executive and early pickleball prospector. Pickleball, of course, is the brand’s main attraction: The evening I visited, Smash Park was hosting a reunion for former players of the Minnesota Vikings and their families, and a quartet of graying ex-football players were deftly dinking back-and-forth across the nets in the indoor gymnasium. The building has the cavernous feel of a waterpark, but is partitioned into areas for eating, drinking and playing: There’s a small bowling alley; a narrow, neon-lit arcade packed with teenagers; an all-season cornhole green abutting a plush lounge area, where couples were mingling and clutching cocktails; a vast outdoor space with yard games where a happy hour crowd gathered. Kelly Sims, vice president of marketing at Smash Park, told me that the company’s target demographic is pretty broad, though it has three main archetypes: the athlete, the “21-plus” customer, and the family. Private events like bachelorette parties and corporate team-building are a big hit, too. Eatertainment isn’t a new phenomenon: Its roots lie in the frenetic arcade ethos of Dave & Buster’s and Chuck E. Cheese; even the misty, fantastical universe of the Rainforest Cafe. But today’s eatertainment has an accelerated, self-serious feel, perhaps driven by increasing competition in the sector to up the ante — to offer an experience more flashy, more distinctly marketable than the next. Take the food: Level 99, a 40,000-square-foot puzzle room complex in Providence, Rhode Island, has a built-in “scratch kitchen” that serves, among other dishes, a brown-butter three-cheese popcorn. Simulated auto racing venue F1 Arcade offers an entire raw bar, including a $129 seafood tower. Even casual eatertainment menus have a studied feel: Puttshack, promising a “culinary journey of global flavors,” has an encyclopedic appetizer list of Lebanese hummus, poutine, Persian chicken skewers, Thai fried chicken, Korean barbecue buns, and chorizo empanadas. As far as entertainment goes, new-wave eatertainment seems to either lean into a garden-of-delights approach, like Smash Park, offering a slew of activities, or to augment classic games with technology: Puttshack, which comes from the founders of Topgolf, uses a similar “Trackaball” technology that automates scorekeeping; Hijingo in the U.K. offers “multi-sensory futuristic bingo” with light shows and live dancers. At ping pong social club Spin, customers can compete against a robot named “Spinny,” an AI opponent with an unfailing serve. An astonishing amount of money has poured into eatertainment in the past few years: Investors run the gamut from nascent venture capital firms to restaurant industry executives to behemoth investment companies like Blackrock. Even pro athletes are cashing in: Puttery received a $10 million investment from pro golfer Rory McIlroy; Travis Kelce and Patrick Mahomes invested in Chicken N Pickle. Like the rest of the hospitality industry, eatertainment was majorly disrupted by pandemic shutdowns, but it has ballooned in the years since: Take entrepreneur Robert Thompson, who dipped out as CEO of Punch Bowl Social shortly before the business filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2020. Three years later, he secured no less than $200 million for his new pickleball venue, Camp Pickle. Then there’s the Emerging Fund, a growth capital fund backed by 30-some hospitality veterans that funds “early-stage” eatertainment and restaurant tech brands. After launching in March of 2023, it raised $52 million in its first six months. What makes eatertainment such an attractive investment? There are the stats: People are dining out less these days, and eatertainment offers two-for-one brand appeal, giving consumers (ostensibly) more bang for their buck by pairing food with entertainment. There’s growing interest in the sector, with certain brands seeing anywhere from 20 to 50 percent traffic increases in the past few years, as Restaurant Business Magazine reports. Other factors make eatertainment a particularly viable business model: Some brands, like Puttshack and Pinstripes, manage to leverage deals with landlords, who are enticed by the venues’ large footprints and high foot traffic potential; others, depending on their model, are able to lower labor costs by employing counter service or self-serve models like beer walls. And, as Restaurant Business Magazine and Restaurant Dive have reported, eatertainment brands often benefit from a relatively high profit margin on the activity portion of the venue, augmenting the revenue earned from food and drink. Puttshack, for example, charges just $14 per person for a round of mini-golf, but Susan Walmesley, the company’s chief operating and marketing officer, confirmed for me that about half the brand’s revenue comes from the game. These factors give eatertainment an edge over traditional restaurant models, helping to facilitate their expansion into new markets. But there’s more to eatertainment’s success than enviable profit margins. The prevailing narrative I found in my reporting is that consumers, having emerged from the isolation and social misery of the pandemic, are craving experience: They want to feel, to connect, to “get a little weird and playful again” after a somber few years. The project of eatertainment, then, is to create an “experience economy,” or even, as Camp Pickle CEO Robert Thompson puts it, a “joy economy.” Eatertainment venues are more than destinations for date nights and office parties; far more than the rudimentary arcades and bowling alleys of eras past: Resting on three axes of pleasure (food, drink, and play), they offer a seamless, satisfying, and bonafide human “experience.” Sims and Smash Park operations director Kristin Kroeger, for example, emphasized to me that Smash Park’s true appeal lies not just in pickleball but in the brand’s combined activities, full bar, “scratch-made kitchen,” and premise of social interaction, all of which alchemize into a single “legendary experience.” I saw what they meant — Smash Park was bumping Bruno Mars as we wandered past the bar and the cornhole green, carpeted with emerald turf; we sipped idly on boozy pink slushies and peered into the private karaoke rooms. The games seemed to me like an absurd and decadent assortment of candy; a manufactured sugar rush. When our axe-throwing time slot arrived, we were ushered to our designated lane. Hurling the axe at the target gave me a thrill at first — I hit a bullseye and screamed — but it waned to a lull as my arms tired; as my aim grew methodical and labored. Between throws, I found myself hypnotized by the flat screen TVs posted around the room, flashing through a Rolodex of event advertisements: Game of Thrones trivia; ’90s name-that-song; a glow-in-the-dark “Dink and Drink” party planned for Saturday night. A queasy feeling began to set in, an emptiness I remembered from playing The Sims as a kid — the sense that I, myself, had set foot in the game. On the outdoor pickleball court, we squinted against the hazy sunshine and batted the ball back-and-forth across the net, debating whether to order the “Big Mule,” a 192-ounce Moscow mule served in a pumpkin-sized copper mug. I realized, gazing above the edge of the pickleball fence at the flat, powdery sky, that what unsettled me about Smash Park — about the eatertainment concept as a whole — was exactly the thing it advertises: its promise of fun; of play; of joy so seamlessly orchestrated, less an “experience” than the simulation of one. If eatertainment has boomed post-pandemic, I find it less likely that we are reimmersing ourselves in the world and more likely that we are retreating further from it, escaping into realities more palatable, more entertaining, than our own. That Friday night, we sat outside and listened to the live music provided for the evening: an affable, dad-aged guy with a guitar, a quarter-zip, and a honeyed voice. We hummed along to Pure Prairie League and munched on our garlic fries. Then he played Van Morrison’s “Brown Eyed Girl” and made a lyrical substitution: “And whatever happened / to Tuesday and so slow / going down to Smash Park with a / transistor radio.” He was being funny, and we laughed, but in my periphery I saw the sky cave a little; hardening like the edges of a snowglobe. At Smash Park, all roads lead to the same place. Additional photo illustration credits: Mini golf image by Puttshack Sign up for our newsletter. Check your inbox for a welcome email. Oops.

Title: Zelensky’s nuclear option: Ukraine ‘months away’ from bomb

Skip to comments. Posted on 11/13/2024 8:52:37 AM PST by marcusmaximus Ukraine could develop a rudimentary nuclear bomb within months if Donald Trump withdraws US military assistance, according to a briefing paper prepared for the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence. The country would quickly be able to build a basic device from plutonium with a similar technology to the “Fat Man” bomb dropped on Nagasaki in 1945, the report states. “Creating a simple atomic bomb, as the United States did within the framework of the Manhattan Project, would not be a difficult task 80 years later,” the document reads. With no time to build and run the large facilities required to enrich uranium, wartime Ukraine would have to rely instead on using plutonium extracted from spent fuel rods taken from Ukraine’s nuclear reactors. Ukraine still controls nine operational reactors and has significant nuclear expertise despite having given up the world’s third largest nuclear arsenal in 1996. The report says: “The weight of reactor plutonium available to Ukraine can be estimated at seven tons … A significant nuclear weapons arsenal would require much less material … the amount of material is sufficient for hundreds of warheads with a tactical yield of several kilotons.” Such a bomb would have about one tenth the power of Fat Man, the document’s authors conclude.

By 1996, Ukraine had returned all of its nuclear warheads to Russia in exchange for economic aid and security assurances.It looks like the security assurances have been violated, so why shouldn't Ukraine get nukes back? 16 posted on 11/13/2024 9:13:20 AM PST by Teacher317 [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: CommerceComet And each of the several Russian missiles fired in response to this single futile effort would be much more powerful than the Fat Man with thousands of missiles still held in reserve.Are we SURE about that? Seriously. Russia has the same reputation as China when it comes to honesty, and when it comes to proper maintenance of older equipment. Russia doesn't have any new nukes, and their military budget is one eleventh the size of ours. AND they've been losing men and materiel for 2 years now, while failing to take Kiev. They need to spend money on maintaining and replacing those losses, they need to spend money and resources on pretending to have a military that compares to ours, AND they're going to maintain the largest number of warheads on earth??? (5500 to our 5000). On only 9% of our budget??? Color me highly skeptical that they have more than a handful of VIABLE nuclear missiles. They seem a lot more like a paper tiger thees days, while getting their tails kicked by an unarmed Ukraine. 17 posted on 11/13/2024 9:19:28 AM PST by Teacher317 [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 14 | View Replies] To: marcusmaximus A bomb 1/10 the power of the WWII bombs is hardly outside the range of bigger conventional weapons. It would not be a game changer against the entrenchments and armor of the enemy on the battlefront (being comparable to the mine the Germans blew up a ridge with in WWI that hardly moved the front line), and would only do enough damage against a Russian city to piss them off and horrify the rest of the planet.

The report says: “The weight of reactor plutonium available to Ukraine can be estimated at seven tons … A significant nuclear weapons arsenal would require much less material … the amount of material is sufficient for hundreds of warheads with a tactical yield of several kilotons.” Such a bomb would have about one tenth the power of Fat Man, the document’s authors conclude.

What a sad indictment of the Ukraine. 80 years after Americans invented the nuclear bomb with slide rules with no guarantee that the science was sound in the middle of WS2 and the Ukes can only build a dirty bomb with 1/10th the power of the Fat Man bomb? What a shortbus country. They and you are ridiculous. Those with your mentality have us closer to WW III and nuclear war than we ever were during the Cold War. Those with your mentality have us closer to WW III and nuclear war than we ever were during the Cold War. I am just waiting for the cruise missile to go off under Zelensky’s ass. As far as I am concerned this would be the best and quickest resolution. Ukraine as a country is already destroyed because the men are gone, the only thing left is for it to be divided up between the Russia and Blackrock. If so, the little GloboHomoPedoNazi Faggot will detonate it in downtown Kiev. If so, the little GloboHomoPedoNazi Faggot will detonate it in downtown Kiev. I don’t think the US or any other of the major military powers on the planet will just stand by, wring their hands and plead: “Oh PLEASE don’t do THAT again…”. No - they will bomb the bejeezus out of Ukraine so that they CAN’T do it again. Ever. Needless to say, MANY people will die. And each of the several Russian missiles fired in response to this single futile effort would be much more powerful than the Fat Man with thousands of missiles still held in reserve. Unless the Russian response is extraordinarily disproportionate, the Western response is likely some stern talk to the Russians and a statement to the Ukraine saying that was a stupid move on your part and you'd be wise to end this war now.

LOLOL!! What Kuks doink? It looks like the security assurances have been violated, so why shouldn't Ukraine get nukes back? Are we SURE about that? Seriously. Russia has the same reputation as China when it comes to honesty, and when it comes to proper maintenance of older equipment. Russia doesn't have any new nukes, and their military budget is one eleventh the size of ours. AND they've been losing men and materiel for 2 years now, while failing to take Kiev. They need to spend money on maintaining and replacing those losses, they need to spend money and resources on pretending to have a military that compares to ours, AND they're going to maintain the largest number of warheads on earth??? (5500 to our 5000). On only 9% of our budget??? Color me highly skeptical that they have more than a handful of VIABLE nuclear missiles. They seem a lot more like a paper tiger thees days, while getting their tails kicked by an unarmed Ukraine. Color me highly skeptical that they have more than a handful of VIABLE nuclear missiles. They seem a lot more like a paper tiger thees days, while getting their tails kicked by an unarmed Ukraine. A bomb 1/10 the power of the WWII bombs is hardly outside the range of bigger conventional weapons. It would not be a game changer against the entrenchments and armor of the enemy on the battlefront (being comparable to the mine the Germans blew up a ridge with in WWI that hardly moved the front line), and would only do enough damage against a Russian city to piss them off and horrify the rest of the planet. This is what desperation sounds like. The article says “develop” a bomb, not USE one. Ukraine had the 3rd largest stockpile in the world just 30 years ago. And we are obligated by treaty to use nukes against anyone that uses nukes against Ukraine. The US did not want nukes in Ukrainian hands for very good reasons. We also violated Budapest by meddling in Ukraine’s internal affairs and via economic coercion.

Title: ‘If I look back to my teenage years, there’s definitely an introvert there’ – Brian O’Driscoll opens up about his childhood

Full Content:
Ireland legend Brian O'Driscoll Brian O’Driscoll has opened up about being "anxious” and not confident” as an introverted teenager and being “on the bench” as a teen before becoming the captain of the Irish rugby team. The former Ireland star has also spoken about what it’s like being on the sidelines with his former teammate Leinster Jonny Sexton at their children’s rugby games. He has revealed he was “anxious” and “not confident” as a teenager and was more of an introvert than his peers and becoming a team captain was a “major shock” to him. "I was the quiet one, happy to never be a ringleader. And that’s why the captaincy was such a weird part to be thrust upon me because I never saw myself in that role,” he told Roasted with Mark Moriarty. “I never captained any underage teams and all of a sudden it was kind of from obscurity that I was chosen to be national captain having no experience previously. "It might have been a shock to everybody else but it was a major shock to me – I definitely didn’t feel I had the qualities or attributes needed to be a good captain and there was so much to learn when I started out. “You've got to find your own way in everything you do. It was a real work for me to understand who I was going to be as a captain, as a leader. “I didn’t make school teams at 15, I was on the bench at 17 in Blackrock. Different things happen for people at different times,” he added. The Dubliner described himself as a “skilful” and “talented” child but his “nervousness” was a challenge for him. However, the rugby star thinks his middle son is braver than him on the rugby field. "I probably would have been afraid of my own shadow as a 14 or 15-year-old. My middle child, who's a keen rugby enthusiast, he's a lot braver than me. “He must have his mother’s toughness because I was nervous about making tackles,” he said. He said that his dad Frank O’Driscoll and himself are “dissimilar in some way” and that his dad is “probably more outgoing than him”. “If I look back to my teenage years, there's definitely an introvert there,” he said. "That then came out as a result of captaincy around rugby, about being projected into the public domain and so all of a sudden, there's another part of your personality comes out or has to come out.” O’Driscoll and his friend and fellow former rugby player Johnny Sexton stand on the sidelines together as their children play in the same club of St Mary’s. Both former rugby stars like to keep quiet while watching their sons play. “I'm not my dad in that regard, my dad was so vocal, I used to be like: ‘Please, be the second loudest dad’. You can still do your thing. "I am very conscious I don’t say anything. What makes it even more challenging is that myself and Sexton’s boys are on the same team so the two of us are on the sideline together. "Neither of us say a whole lot. We just watch and see what’s going on, let them enjoy it. There’s so much: ‘Would you like your son to be a professional rugby player?’. Let them enjoy it, see where it goes,” he added.

Title: BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF hits $40 billion, sets new record in 211 days

BlackRock has done it again. This time its IBIT spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) has hit a record of over $41 billion in net assets in 211 days. News of the milestone comes two weeks after BlackRock reached $30 billion in net assets in 293 days at the end of October. Posting on X in October, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas, said what BlackRock has achieved is an “all-time record,” adding “the old record was $JEPI which did it in 1,272 days. $GLD took 1,790 days. Unreal.” With BlackRock’s new achievement, it’s surpassed the previous record of 1,253 days held by iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF, according to Balchunas. In a post on X, he said: “[BlackRock’s] now in Top 1% of all ETFs by assets and at 10mo old it is bigger than all 2,800 ETFs launched in the past TEN years.” JUGGERNAUT: $IBIT has hit the $40b asset mark (a mere two wks after hitting $30b) in a record 211 days, annihilating prev record of 1,253 days held by $IEMG. It's now in Top 1% of all ETFs by assets and at 10mo old it is bigger than all 2,800 ETFs launched in the past TEN years. pic.twitter.com/WTATlpShUq — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 13, 2024 Now, BlackRock holds more than 467,000 Bitcoin, valued at $41.8 billion, according to iShares data. The new record comes as Bitcoin reached an all-time high of over $93,000 on November 13 in a continued rally that’s showing no signs of slowing. The upward trajectory is partly due to Donald Trump being re-elected as US President earlier this month. Following news of his win, Bitcoin broke the $75,000 mark. It then passed $82,000, and continued to $84,000, before pushing to $87,000 earlier this week. In September, Bernstein analysts predicted that Bitcoin would surge to between $80,000 and $90,000 if Trump won the US election. With that prediction having now passed, Bernstein analysts believe Bitcoin could reach $200,000 in 2025, urging investors to “buy everything they can.” It remains to be seen how far Bitcoin will go, but for now, it’s showing no signs of slowing down.

Hit your long-term targets. Earn up to 16% per year on digital assets. Share this article BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has amassed $40 billion in assets under management just 211 days after its launch. The fund has ascended to the top 1% of all ETFs in terms of assets, outpacing all 2,800 ETFs launched in the past decade, said Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. The achievement shatters the previous record of 1,253 days held by the iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF, a BlackRock-managed fund that tracks the investment results of an index composed of large-, mid-, and small-capitalization companies in emerging markets. At just 10 months old, IBIT has also grown larger than its Gold ETF counterpart, the iShares Gold Trust (IAU), which currently holds around $32.3 billion in assets. Since its January debut, IBIT has netted approximately $29 billion in net inflows, Farside Investors data shows. The surge in Bitcoin’s price, fueled by factors like Trump’s election victory and potential regulatory changes, has driven demand for IBIT, as well as other Bitcoin ETFs. Bitcoin just set a new record high of $93,000 at the time of reporting, per CoinGecko. The leading crypto asset has surpassed Saudi Aramco to become the world’s 7th largest asset, according to Companies Market Cap. The latest achievement comes just days after Bitcoin overtook silver’s position. The pace of Bitcoin ETF accumulation has accelerated following Trump’s reelection, with a massive $2.8 billion being poured into IBIT in the last four trading days. The group of US spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively attracted over $4 billion in net inflows. In a Tuesday statement, Balchunas suggested that these funds are nearing the estimated Bitcoin holdings of Satoshi Nakamoto, potentially surpassing the creator of Bitcoin by Thanksgiving. Market analysts expect continued inflows into Bitcoin ETFs, supported by the positive sentiment surrounding the crypto markets and potential future developments.

Election 2024 coverage presented by BlackRock, the world's largest asset-management company, said it is bringing its tokenized real-world asset fund to five more blockchains, taking it beyond Ethereum and expanding access to the largest money-market fund token. The BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), issued in partnership with tokenization platform Securitize, is now accessible on the Aptos, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Optimism's OP Mainnet and Polygon networks, the company said on Wednesday. Tokenization of real-world assets is one of the hottest trends at the intersection of crypto and traditional finance. Digital asset firms and global financial heavyweights are racing to put instruments such as government bonds, private credit and funds on blockchain rails, aiming to achieve faster settlements and operational efficiencies. "We wanted to develop an ecosystem that was thoughtfully designed to be digital and take advantage of the advantages of tokenization," Securitize CEO and co-founder Carlos Domingo said in a statement. "With these new chains we'll start to see more investors looking to leverage the underlying technology to increase efficiencies on all the things that until now have been hard to do."

The BUIDL token is backed by short-term U.S. government bonds and its price is anchored to $1. Institutions and protocol treasuries use the product to park their on-chain cash to earn a yield or as collateral for trading, while other decentralized finance protocols such as Ondo Finance build their products on top of it. BUIDL has raked in over $520 million of deposits, becoming the largest product in the $2.3 billion tokenized U.S. Treasury market, rwa.xyz data shows. BUIDL's management fee on Ethereum, Arbitrum and Optimism is 50 basis points. It is cheaper — only 20 basis points — on Aptos, Avalanche and Polygon. Ecosystem development organizations Aptos Foundation, Avalanche (BVI), Inc. and Polygon Labs BD Investments (Cayman) Ltd. each agreed to pay BlackRock a quarterly fee. Edited by Sheldon Reback.

Yesterday, gardaí, assisted by members from the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau, as well as colleagues from Europol, executed a search warrant at an address in Blackrock. The investigation relates to a large-scale operation of alleged money laundering and follows a number of international complaints into various forms of alleged online fraud. An investigation team was established in the DMR East garda district as a result and suspicious activity was identified in a number of bank accounts. This included money transactions from hundreds of bank accounts from over 15 countries across Europe, suspected to be the proceeds of crime and ‘money mule’ transactions. A ‘money mule’ is a person who allows their bank account to be used for the transfer of another person’s stolen or illegal money.

Title: Trump Adds to List of Fake EU Crises

For the EU, fake crises like the Russia threat and Trump abandoning NATO mean more giveaways to (mostly US) weapons companies. They mean more neoliberalism through more social spending cuts and privatizations due to lack of funds and more war on the working class. Any threat posed by Trump (and the Biden administration or whoever comes after Trump) is the result of the very real crises of Europe’s overdependence on the US and energy prices hurting industry, but those are deemed necessary to deal with the fake crises. Has the reemergence of the bad orange man caused any rethink about the EU strategy to “de-risk” from Russia and China and put itself at the mercy of Washington? Or are Europeans falling over themselves with pledges to increase defense spending? It’s the latter. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, as usual, takes the cake. She managed to come up with a plan that would shoot the EU in both feet with her idea to buy even more gas from the US. This would increase dependence on the US while simultaneously doing even more to wreck the economies of EU states. Here’s Politico with the details: Stressing that the EU still buys significant amounts of energy from Russia, von der Leyen asked: “Why not replace it by American LNG, which is cheaper for us and brings down our energy prices? It’s something where we can get into a discussion, also [where] our trade deficit is concerned.” During the first Trump term, Juncker avoided more tariffs by assuring the U.S. president that Europe would facilitate more imports of liquefied natural gas (and more American soybeans.) In fact, the European Commission has no real power in determining European companies’ purchases of LNG and soybeans, but Trump was happy to accept the political theater of parading data that European purchases were going up. There is no evidence that American LNG is cheaper, as von der Leyen is quoted as saying. It’s actually a lot more expensive than the pipeline Russian gas Europe used to get. And the European Commission does have some power in determining European companies’ purchases of LNG through its sanction powers. And the Commission doesn’t have the power to dictate purchases yet. Due to recent crises, EU member states added new instruments to Ursula’s toolbox during her first five-year term, such as the Foreign Subsidies Regulation, International Procurement Instrument, an Anti-Coercion Instrument, the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive, and the EU Critical Raw Materials Act. Maybe the latest Trump crisis will add another tool to her toolbox. One gets the feeling that Ursula is intentionally trying to do economic damage to bloc nations in order to increase the odds she gets her coveted eurobonds. If there’s another crisis — or series of crises — she might get the chance. Countries having to throw more money at the energy crisis and shrinking GDPs could struggle to pay more for defense, which would lead to more calls for joint borrowing. Some background on the idea from Euractiv: This miracle happened during the eurozone crisis when the EU created a legal instrument, the European Financial Stability Facility, able to issue bonds and with a lending capacity of €440 billion. And with the COVID pandemic, the miracle was repeated as the EU adopted a recovery fund with a firepower of €750 billion, financed through common debt issuance. The same line of thinking has inspired politicians to imagine defence bonds – to finance a major boost of the EU’s defence capabilities, after years of neglect when it was assumed that war was a thing of the past or that Uncle Sam would always come to the EU’s defence… Speaking at the European Defence Agency annual conference on 30 November, [European Council President Charles] Michel said EU member states should pool what could amount to €600 billion in defence investment over the next 10 years… A couple of weeks later, French President Emmanuel Macron returned to the topic, telling investors at the World Economic Forum in Davos that Europe should resort to joint debt to finance its priorities, including defence. In the ensuing months the argument for joint debt has come to include remedies for other EU problems. European heads of state met in Budapest last week with a focus on competitiveness. That’s the buzzword these days. Europe isn’t competitive enough. Mario Draghi was there pushing his sham solutions from the standard neoliberal playbook. Just consider the following. If you are worried about competitiveness do you: Of course none of this was discussed in Budapest. National leaders instead opted for minor measures and slogans like “ensuring industrial renewal and decarbonization,” “increasing preparedness and defence capabilities,” and “putting Europe at the forefront of global research and innovation.” They’re all empty phrases without the money and some semblance of a strategy to back them up. The EU is, however, planning to redirect billions to defense from its social cohesion funds. How much remains to be seen, and there are tradeoffs. That money used to be earmarked to reduce economic disparities and promote development. EU capitals will now have more “flexibility” to spend the funds to support their defense industries and military projects. According to the FT, only about five percent of the 392 billion euros allocated for 2021-2027 has been spent to date. While Ursula and company didn’t get common EU debt yet, the crises are only picking up steam. And it should be noted that redirected social cohesion funds is considered one of the final emergency steps before turning to the joint EU debt. Ursula is unlikely to let it go as it’s the top goal of her second term. It was only in March of this year that the idea of joint borrowing for defense was considered “radical.” Now surrounded by fake crises and self-inflicted real ones, the idea is gaining trans-Atlantic traction. Let’s not forget that international finance is a big fan of the joint debt for defense plan. Since member states are running into budgetary constraints, investors are using the fiscal rules imposed by Brussels to push for an EU-wide bond program that would bring them big-time profits while allowing the bloc to ramp up military spending without individual nations incurring more debt. Much of Europe supports joint borrowing because in theory, there could be benefits to common debt, especially for countries like Italy which face higher borrowing costs, but going down that road to pay for the US empire ain’t it. The two staunchest opponents to joint debt are Germany and the Netherlands. Are they prepared to withstand the pressure from financial powers, the Trump administration, and much of Europe? The signs aren’t encouraging. The Dutch are currently killing Europe’s most valuable tech firm at the behest of the Americans for some pyrrhic and temporary victory against China. Germany might soon be led by a former board member of BlackRock, Friedrich Merz, which will be a nebulous plus, according to Politico: Scholz’s woes may have a silver lining for some: In Budapest, some diplomats suggested that the collapse of Germany’s ruling coalition and Merz becoming chancellor might not be a bad thing. Merz “is a former MEP so more engaged on European affairs,” said one EU diplomat who was granted anonymity to speak freely. “He’s also from the EPP, so the same family as the dominant force in [the European] Parliament, also the same family as von der Leyen, which can help at a time like this. The Logic Behind More Defense Spending As the FT notes, and all the media stories do the same, ‘Trump warned Nato allies earlier this year that as president he would encourage Russia to do “whatever the hell they want” if alliance members failed to meet their defence spending target.’ Yet even if Moscow wanted to invade Europe (there’s no sign it does nor any reason it would want to) what are all these extra billions going to do that all the billions and all the West’s military hardware in Ukraine couldn’t do? So the EU argument is as follows: Trump says we must spend more, there’s nothing we can do because orange man bad and we need the US because we cut ourselves off from Russia and China. Meanwhile real economies are imploding, and more forced austerity coming — although there has been talk about a carve out in the spending limits for defense spending. It was always going to end this way due to a political class that sees themselves as faithful servants to the US empire and transnational capital and have nothing but scorn for the local peasants. They’re all groveling now before Trump. It’s easy to see why: Two percent of GDP on defense spending isn’t enough, says German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock. President Duda said in his Independence Day speech that all NATO states must increase their military spending to a minimum 3%, an increase from the 2% spending target agreed on in 2014. Trump recently also said that 3% is needed for NATO. Poland will spend 4.7% next year 🇵🇱🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/CuWDaGWPNf — Visegrád 24 (@visegrad24) November 12, 2024 The thing is Europe has been spending more. In many ways Europe’s bureaucracy has already changed in small but fundamental ways in order to redirect money towards the military-industrial complex. From Equal Times: “In 2023, there was a very significant increase in military spending worldwide, but especially in Europe. In Spain, for example, it grew by 24 per cent and in Finland by 36 per cent. If we compare it with 2013, the European countries in Nato are spending 30 per cent more,” says Pere Ortega, a researcher at the Barcelona-based Centre Delàs for Peace Studies, which is critical of measures adopted by the European Commission to promote military spending, such as the VAT exemption for the purchase of armaments or the change in the regulations of the European Investment Bank (EIB) to allow it to finance industrial projects in the military sphere. And according to the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR), the number of countries meeting the two percent target has risen from 3 to 23 since 2014: IN Germany, much has been made about the government’s scaling back of support for Ukraine, and how the cabinet’s approved military budget only increased by 1.25 billion euros to 53.25 billion this year but as WSWS points out: …the government is actually spending far more on armaments and war. A government overview of the budget states that “taking into account the relevant shares of other individual plans,” the NATO target of military spending of at least 2 percent of gross domestic product will be achieved. With a GDP of €4.122 trillion, this means at least €82.4 billion in military spending. The sum is probably even higher, as Scholz has already boasted of defence spending of €90 billion to NATO. In addition to the central defence budget, the government has already announced “defence-related expenditure” of €14 billion from other budget areas in the current year. Further projects totalling €20 billion will be paid from the Bundeswehr “special fund,” which totals €150 billion…In 2028, when it is expected the Bundeswehr special fund will be exhausted, the defence budget is set to rise by a huge increase of almost €30 billion to around €80 billion. Where has it gotten them? In the case of Germany, not much, at least according to a September report from the Kiel Institute: … the build-up of German capacities is progressing slowly. We document Germany’s military procurement in a new Kiel Military Procurement Tracker and find that Germany did not meaningfully increase procurement in the one and a half years after February 2022, and only accelerated it in late 2023. Given Germany’s massive disarmament in the last decades and the current procurement speed, we find that for some key weapon systems, Germany will not attain 2004 levels of armament for about 100 years. When taking into account arms commitments to Ukraine, some German capacities are even falling. The Plan All Along? The funny thing about all the gnashing of teeth over Trump and the danger he poses to NATO, is Europe shouldering more of the American empire’s load in the Russian periphery has long been the stated goal. If we look at what neocons, the real movers and shakers in the plutocrats and their think tanks on both sides of the Atlantic, and European politicians say, this was the plan. Here’s a September report from the Munich Security Conference, commonly referred to as “Davos with guns”: Russia’s aggressive revisionism has underscored NATO’s primacy in European defense. However, the real possibility of Donald Trump returning to the White House means that Europeans may soon have to seize a much larger share of the burden, both in supporting Ukraine and deterring Russia. A strong European Defence Union, based on the EU’s regulatory powers, ability to pool resources, and large single market, can become an important enabler of a more robust European pillar within NATO. Here is a team from the influential Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) writing earlier this year in Foreign Affairs about how Europe must lead in the fight against Russia so the US can focus on China: That complicated reality requires U.S. allies, especially in Europe, to take on a larger share of directing the containment of Russia. Europe has shown its political and economic resilience in the face of Russian aggression. Yet militarily, the continent remains dependent on the United States. This dynamic must change, in part because the United States must commit more of its resources to Asia. The growth of European defense spending since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine is an encouraging step. In 2023, 11 NATO members hit their spending target, allocating at least two percent of GDP to national defense, up from just seven members in 2022. The rest need to follow suit. Europe must also resolve the problem of coordination. Right now, the United States coordinates more than 25 militaries in Europe. While it must continue to do this in the short term, it must push individual European countries and the European Union to take over this role and to create a stronger European pillar in NATO. The Centre for European Policy Studies with more: Against this backdrop, the EU’s true ‘Hamiltonian moment’ in defence would be a decision to issue joint debt to properly fund the ambitions set out in its Defence Industrial Strategy. Based on Art. 122 TFEU and implemented in accordance with Articles 173-174 TFEU, such bonds—possible under the EU’s Financial Regulation—could provide the backbone for grants to Member States to bolster the Union’s defence production capacity if paired with existing incentives for joint capabilities research, development, production, and procurement. This would avoid the two-speed logic and weaker conditionalities surrounding proposals to use the European Stability Mechanism (excluding key countries such as Poland, Sweden and Denmark) to issue loans to EU Member States for defence spending. Like how the Covid-induced Recovery and Resilience Facility stabilised European markets and sustained demand during and after the pandemic, Euro-defence bonds are a potential game-changer for the EU’s defence ambitions due to the potential speed and scale of resource mobilisation, and the potential impact on market de-fragmentation. And, fortunately, the German Constitutional Court should have nothing to object to this time around. And you can read the same in Scholz’s Zeitenwende, and in the speeches by Baerbock that Germany will lead the fight in Europe for the “rules-based order” while the US focuses on China. So what’s the problem with Trump telling them to get a move on? That they actually need to do it now rather than just talk? That Trump is more crass where someone like Biden would extol the trans-Atlantic alliance while shoving the knife in? Whatever Trump’s motivations, the faction of ascendant neocons who favor an American exit from Ukraine while making the Europeans spend more so that Washington can focus more on Iran and China are following a path long laid out. This is part and parcel of the neocon plan to use European vassals in an effort to preserve and expand the US empire. And the European political class is so far more than happy to go along. They don’t have much of a choice anymore: How much longer will the bloc’s citizens cooperate? To say Europe is in free fall would be an insult to gravity. And yet despite the endless stream of awful economic news, the political class’s complete detachment from reality, the embarrassing servility to the US, there isn’t yet a major threat to Europe’s willful vassalage. Germany’s upcoming election will be interesting to see how the Alternative for Germany (AfD) and Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW) perform. The two parties come at it from different angles, but both oppose bending the knee to Washington. They are currently polling at around a combined 24.5 percent, and barring an improvement, are likely to remain out of any ruling coalition. Until someone like the AfD or BSW can take charge, all the “crises” will continue working to the advantage of the few. Over the turbulent past few years in which real wages plummeted and deindustrialization took hold, the wealthiest added to their fortune and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen amassed more power that she uses for interests of the Western plutocrats centered in the US. With this being what the EU leaders of the “center” want and with the big bad orange man insisting upon more, they seem to compliment each other quite nicely. Many thanks for this article. Over the last day (following the temporary goods news about Haley and Pompeo) the Trump transition team have announced what has been arguably the most astounding list of cabinet level appointments in US history. They would appear to mark a total rout of the Carlson wing of the GOP by the Likudnik wing, with the most ‘advanced’ neocons taking control of the diplomatic, military and security levers of what we must now presumably call the Adelson/Musk Administration. As others have noted, a pathologically deluded Europe is going through a Morgenthau moment, and is almost anxious to help the US press it towards geostrategic perdition. It therefore seems to me that Ukraine, and most especially the Ukraine reconstruction bill, will be passed to the Europeans, but this is presumably chiefly so that the US can concentrate its fire upon the embers of Palestine (by proxy), and more especially upon Iran and China. If so, it would seem that Trump and his acolytes sincerely believe Russia can still be separated from China and/or Iran. Do they want another 1914 moment, this time with nuclear weapons, simply to prove the point that separating Russia from China may not now prove possible? Or is it that they wish to use nuclear brinkmanship to prise Russia from China? Or am I just being totally hysterical? There was a saying in Germany towards the end of WWII: enjoy the war, peace will be terrible. That is were our leaders are now. Not the nitwits like Baerbock and her green comrades. They are to stupid to understand that the war was lost from day one. But opportunists like the leading politicians from the legacy parties. They understand very well what beckons once the war is over. People will ask what it was all for? And why did it not end sooner? They will also have to somehow come to terms with Russia again. They are all in the same boat with Selensky in that they want this terrible day as far off as possible. And if this day will come at least they want it to be at a time when there are no elections soon. I believe that is why the German government finally disintegrated. They know very well that the end is nigh and they want it to happen after the elections when they have four more years for people to forget this disaster. As to Washington I follow Doug Mcgregor who evidently believes the new DefSec will finally acknowledge reality. Reality being that the US is way over its head militarily. The only conclusion can then be that the Ukraine war must be wount down. There´s fear and loathing at the prospect in the EU but it can´t be helped. The big question is whether the political system in Western Europe can survive this moment of truth. To me it feels like 1989 just before the break of the Berlin wall. The above sounds like what Tuchman called The March of Folly. The revival of oligarchy means they are back to a “whose is bigger” competition between owners of Dreadnoughts. The fact that a century after WW1 Europe is in the same antagonistic mess merely shows that human events revolve around competition between biological beings rather than economic algorithms. Only when the disaster becomes severe enough will we revert to another Age of Reason. However I’d say we need to wait and see what happens before assuming Trump is onboard with this. It could be he is indeed transactional and merely playing the part of the strongman to sweeten The Deal. I haven’t read his book so maybe it is all in there. Thank you and well said. I note your quip about the “likudnik wing”. Likud organises in the UK and has done since the 1940s. At first, it was called Herut until Herut and Likud merged four decades later. This is quite separate from the Conservative and Labour Friends of Israel. Modi’s BJP and RSS are beginning to organise in the UK and ally with Likud and CFI and LFI. The Zionist formations welcome such organisation as a means of beefing up numbers and influence. Great introspection into the false choices chicken hawks present to expand and continue their profitable wars and sanctions.. Vietnam, Iraq, Afgan, Ukraine, Israel, Syria. etc. None of the choices are peace. Trump may be forcing Britain and Europe (and of course Russia) to settle their own problems of security, terrorist attacks and mass killings. With those Eurobonds there will be a kicker. They just can’t be created out of thin air but will need to be backed by something as a form of collateral. And according to the guys at The Duran, this will be a EU tax that will be levied across every member state in the EU. All that money will be siphoned out of all those countries where it will be sent to Brussels where we can assume that it will be wisely spent and none of it pilfered. Maybe at first it will only be a very small tax but if there is one thing about taxes we know it is that it always goes up. And typing this I wonder if this might be turned into another tool in that “favoured” countries may get a rebate (Germany? France?) while everybody else has to pay full freight (Hungary? Slovakia?). The opportunities here for corruption are endless. Most of that money will end up in the US, to buy US weapons systems, LOL. Ursula’s plan, particularly the next 6 year budget proposal has not yet been disclosed so IMO it is too early to say what is at stake. EU budget is just 1% of EU GDP and most of it goes to the CAP (Common Agricultural Policy). If it is true that part of the CAP and cohesion funds are to be reduced and diverted to defence spending i believe the political discussion is going to be fierce. Also, the EC having no competence in defence, as per the treaties, i believe that finding those “holes” in the treaties for the EC to have its own defence budget would need a lot of overstretching of EU rules to the brink of rupture. IMO, it is almost certain this would require modifications of the treaties signed by each and all EU members. I might be mistaken but this has the same probabilities as the Eurobonds (null). Not to mention that the potential amounts to be directed to defence spending would not have probably any meaningful effect in defence capabilities in the EU to start with. So, this, I believe, so far doesn’t go beyond neocon dreams aired in loud voice by the neocon FT and balloon probes to test the waters. No covering any particular defence objective, if there is any it is only bureaucratic, risking disputes and discontent, what is the point here? I think the “road” to EU defense spending is through NATO. The likely story is that the EU and NATO will blend informally at first and more formally eventually. I believe the future belongs to militarism and permanent war (a cheap way to “unite” subject populations, i.e., the Europ public). It has worked in the USA despite losing every war every decade. The point is never to “win” but to keep the movement towards the ruling-classes dream of a neo-Orwellian world order. We’ll just have to see if that works–but that’s the agenda in my view. A big reason why I like ‘Naked Capitalism’ is that the comments are usually, not always, intelligently stated even if I don’t agree and which is a big difference compared to other sites so thanks much, Mike Liston Thanks for the kind words! Thank you! And your colleagues. Excellent piece, thanks! >”How much longer will the bloc’s citizens cooperate?” For another 2 decades for sure. Until critical wealth has been spent on trash. Right now German society is still too rich to experience a revolutionary moment. How much expense on 9/11 wars and social rollback were necessary for the GOP under Trump to be able to take WH & both houses with a popular vote? And considering that top 50% of US income starts at $100,000 annual wage – that´s still a rich country. The antisemitism resolution passed German parliament without a peep. Most educated will not vote for BSW because they are too anti-immigration. Putin & Xi are dictators and the Uyghurs are forced into camps and there is an Axis of Evil. As long as such narratives hold sway you won´t get political change. I’m not sure about “two decades” but you are, more or less, correct. As long as Western intel is in charge of the news media (IMHO) Europeans who are becoming as befuddled as North Americans with the “too much information age” are looking for narratives that work and that they can follow without disordering their lives with thinking for themselves and can continue to pursue empty lives of radical materialism (Euro people are prone to this). People who are confused crave meaning and crave to be ruled rather than rule themselves. Great comment Chris! Are you thinking of this USA election as a revolutionary moment? In true spirit of these times, I’ll bet the inequality continues to expand. It’s revolutionary times for billionaires…still. “Revolutionary,” as the word is often applied to the turmoil in the late Roman Republic. The oligarchy had become split into two main factions, the boni and the populares. These rivals were mostly drawn from the same class (Caesar, Clodius, Catiline were all aristocrats), but the populares appealed to the poorer citizens in order to gain an edge. When the boni were finally defeated, there was little fundamental change in the class structure of Roman society. Nevertheless, there was a considerable turnover in terms of the actual personnel composing the dominant class; a lot of Darwin Awards got handed out. Is there a parallel to the declining Romans “allying” with the Goths? Potential heirs to empire? Does the EU population want ascendant Germans? Russia and China are watching. My later observations about the PRC naval challenge is: how can the US Navy be more relevant and get some ships*? Resurgent Plan Orange, and Alfred Thayer Mahan’s thesis! A major naval force engagement concentration and mass! The US Navy needs 16 aircraft carriers, while they extend the lives of DDG (aegis destroyers) bc can’t get new ones out of build. *After squandering years and billions on the little crappy ships (LCS). Of course I’m just an simple peasant, but it seems to me that an investment in a ‘Manhattan Project,’ or a ‘moon shot’ of diplomacy around the world to resolve the issues that facilitate this destructive militarism, would be magnitudes cheaper, and much better for the planet and it’s inhabitants than the continual flogging of the ‘peace through strength’ strategy which historically has been quite counterproductive. In the words of the immortal Rodney King, “Why can’t we all just get along.” There is no interest in the Western Empire for “peace” because the need by the oligarchs is to maintain and enhance their control over their subject populations. How else are they going to maintain the rule of the corrupt and the ideology of hedonism and radical materialism? War is the answer to all their dreams and peace the major threat to the Imperial regime. Especially since the current concept of ‘western style democracy,’ has evolved into a system where the ability of politicians to get their name on a ballot, is primarily determined by which candidate is able to raise the most money by the advance selling of favors to billionaires whose interests don’t align with the majority of the electorate. Yup, that about sums it up. I feel like Matthew Modine in Altman’s “Short Cuts”, forced to sit through a dinner party with a vapid couple minutes after an argument with my wife in which she confessed a casual adultery like it was nothing. Sheer madness and I must endure. Sigh. Sometimes the simple ideas are always the best. George Orwell’s character in 1984–Emmanuel Goldstein–gave the best explanation for perpetual war: “The primary aim of modern warfare (in accordance with the principles of doublethink), is to use up the products of the machine without raising the general standard of living.” The European people are our last hope. Putin may have overestimated his military capabilities when he attacked Ukraine. He certainly understands now that he could not invade Europe with any hope of victory or profit. However, the Russians may feel it necessary to fight in self-defense. The US has been lost now to militarist factions and ideology. Our only hope for the future seems to be European alliances, economic and military, with Russia as equals. What other hope is there. Europe cannot fail. Good idea, but it does it Exclude lid the US view of its importance? Which Would make it fail,or more accurately, forced onto failure . Definitely agree, we (UK and Europe) would be well rid of the US and their bullying. However they have so much printed money to spend and we know how greedy people are… Putin doesn’t have any military capability, unless you can count some judo by +70 year old. Russia, on the other hand, has one of the most powerful and capable military on Earth. That said, many (real) experts and commentators have stated that it will take a generation or two until Russia will even bother to piss on the rest of Europe* if it was on fire. EU and NATO have build a new Iron Curtain and it’s those two who will have to tear it down to have any significant role in the world. Or even survive. * Russia covers 40% of Europe, it’s the biggest country of the subcontinent. This smells a bit of western centrism. There are other modes. China is not doing too bad, nor Japan… This doesn’t meen europeans need to become Chinese… Does Europe intend to get into a hot war with Russia? Is that the purpose of the increased military spending? If not, it all seems silly from a capitalist perspective. Acquiring tens of billions of dollars of military hardware and then not using it means lots of expensive items collect dust and, more importantly, the arms merchants don’t have repeat sales which is anathema to capitalists everywhere. Europe is playing a very dangerous game arming up. The temptations to use the weapons will increase, and so will the risk of nuclear confrontation. There are lots of nice cultural icons across Europe. It would be a shame to lose them all. This extra ‘American LNG’ will also be Russian except bought via America. (They haven’t enough of their own fracked gas and it’s expensive for them.) Anyway, They dropped their own sanctions against Russian gas last week in preparation for a nice deal with Russia where they both profit. The Euros are such suckers! Why at least Germany does not sign a peace deal with Russia and turn on the remaining Nordstream is beyond me. Are you saying EU elites are DUMBER than the American voters? Yeah, well, I guess that’s not surprising, American elites (say about 90%) are dumber than American voters too. I’ve never seen a whole subcontinent of elites stick their head in the oven and turn on the gas this way. Crazy to watch. Sorry the rest of the EU gets to go along for the ride.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 14 AI News Investors Are Paying Attention To. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other AI stocks investors are paying attention to. The release of ChatGPT by OpenAI, now the most valuable private firm in the world, back in November 2022 had widespread implications for the technology industry. In the two years since the release, technology valuations, which had hit a snag due to broader inflation and slowing growth concerns, have jumped back up. Technology giants have surpassed multi-trillion dollar valuations and OpenAI itself has crossed $150 billion in value. In this environment, technology firms have been pushing for greater capital expenditures on AI infrastructure, telling investors that adding more data and computing power will consistently lead to improved AI models.

However, news agency Reuters reports that new techniques being used by AI firms to train their AI models could reshape the AI arms race, and have implications for the types of resources that AI companies have an insatiable demand for, from energy to types of chips. For example, Ilya Sutskever, a Canadian-Israeli computer scientist who was one of the founders of OpenAI, has said that results from scaling up pre-training have plateaued. The computer scientist claims that the 2010s were the age of scaling, and now we're back in the age of wonder and discovery once again. Everyone is looking for the next thing, and scaling the right thing matters more now than ever.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) is a California-based technology company that owns and runs the internet search engine Google. On November 9, tech website Android Authority reported that the AI-capable Tensor processors developed by Google for the Pixel line of smartphones had failed to meet financial targets. The report highlights that the financial goal for the tech titan is about $65 per chip to make the business viable. For additional context, the tech website claims that Qualcomm’s latest flagship chips cost around $150. Google released the latest Pixel phones earlier this year.

Screenshot 2024-11-14 122343.png (NSE data show) Swiggy’s diversification strategy Swiggy’s revenue model spans multiple verticals, including its core food delivery service, Swiggy Instamart (grocery delivery), and Swiggy Genie (parcel delivery). This diverse service portfolio has helped Swiggy generate a gross revenue of ₹5,705 crore in the fiscal year 2023, representing a year-over-year growth of 40%. Swiggy Instamart alone contributed over ₹1,500 crore to Swiggy’s overall revenue, showcasing strong traction in the quick-commerce grocery sector. However, this broad approach comes with challenges. Swiggy’s operational expenses reached ₹7,280 crore in FY 2023, resulting in a net loss of ₹1,575 crore, a slight improvement from ₹1,850 crore in FY 2022. While Swiggy’s diversified model spreads risk, it also requires heavy capital investment, and the quick-commerce segment, in particular, has yet to show consistent profitability. Zomato’s focused business model Zomato, on the other hand, has opted to maintain a streamlined focus on food delivery, while experimenting selectively with quick-commerce following its acquisition of Blinkit. In FY 2023, Zomato reported a revenue of ₹6,300 crore, marking a 68% increase from ₹3,750 crore in FY 2022. Despite exiting grocery delivery early on, Zomato’s recent acquisition of Blinkit has contributed to its revenue and may provide additional growth potential if it successfully scales. Zomato’s net loss in FY 2023 was ₹450 crore, a notable improvement from ₹1,200 crore in FY 2022, reflecting its commitment to reducing operational inefficiencies and enhancing profitability. Unlike Swiggy, Zomato’s operating expenses were more concentrated, allowing it to streamline costs in food delivery. For investors, Zomato’s focused approach, coupled with this reduced net loss, demonstrates potential for achieving profitability earlier than Swiggy. Profitability remains a major concern for both companies, though they have made strides toward improving their unit economics. Know more Quick commerce refers to the delivery of consumer items in 10-30 minutes. Blinkit, Zepto, Swiggy Instamart, and Flipkart Minutes are among the top quick commerce platforms in India.

Screenshot 2024-11-14 110145.png (NSE data) Swiggy Stock Listing by Bajaj Broking Research “Swiggy’s listing on the Indian stock market has stirred up notable excitement, but early trading volatility reveals investor caution. While there’s optimism about Swiggy’s potential to capture further market share in India’s Android evolving food delivery and quick commerce segments, the road to profitability may be bumpy. Swiggy has shown impressive growth potential, yet persistent losses over recent fiscal years signal challenges ahead. Investors may need to brace for a dynamic journey as the company seeks to balance expansion with sustainable financial performance.” Swiggy shares trade flat on the NSE at ₹454.35 as at 10.21 am after a fresh high at ₹489.40. Swiggy shares ​ended the listing day trading session ​at ₹464 on NSE, an 18.97 per cent premium to the IPO price of ₹390, and at ₹455.95 on BSE, a 16.9 per cent premium. Swiggy’s ₹11,300-crore-IPO was subscribed 3.59 times primarily driven by interest from institutional investors. The shares​ got listed on bourses at nearly 8 per cent premium.​ Swiggy shares rallied over 10 per cent to close at ₹454 and ₹455.95 on the NSE and BSE, respectively.

Swiggy shares jumped 6.43% on the NSE to ₹447 as at 3.02 pm. On the BSE, the stock rallied 8.56% to ₹447.25. With Swiggy listing on the stock exchanges on November 13 at a premium, the debate intensifies over whether Swiggy or Zomato offers the better investment in India’s booming food delivery market Investors are keenly comparing Swiggy to its main competitor, Zomato, which has already experienced two years in the public market. Both companies are key players in India’s food delivery industry, valued at approximately $4.5 billion in 2023 and projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 25% over the next five years. This analysis compares the financials, growth potential, and strategic directions of Swiggy and Zomato, shedding light on which platform may offer stronger returns. Market position and financial performance Both Swiggy and Zomato have carved out significant shares in the Indian market, with Zomato accounting for approximately 55% and Swiggy for about 45% of the market by 2023. However, the companies differ significantly in revenue composition and business models, which influence their respective investment potential. Track bl’s stock market live updates here Instamart essentially a play on broader retail; has immense potential to grow: We see immense growth potential in Instamart given QC is essentially a play on the broader retail market, which was sized at ~USD 1trln in CY22. While Swiggy tested the dark store-led business model first, sudden rise in competition and better execution by competition did lead to market share erosion. Despite that, in GOV terms, we estimate Instamart was only behind Blinkit as of FY24, with a market share of ~28%. Moreover, the QC channel penetration within the broader retail market even today is barely ~0.35%, compared to ~5-6% e-retail penetration. Even assuming the QC channel penetration will reach only 1.5-2% over the next 5 years, the market can expand at >50% CAGR. This will ensure exponential GOV/Revenue growth for Instamart over the medium term. Moreover, the QC business model has enough operating leverage to turn self-sustainable, when operating at scale. Screenshot 2024-11-13 143942.png Swiggy shares traded at ₹443 on the NSE, higher by 5.48% as at 2.17 pm. On the BSE, the stock climbed 7.91% to ₹444.60. Swiggy’s listing underscores the dominance of short-term subscribers, evident in the lukewarm participation from Non-Institutional Investors (NIIs) and subdued retail interest. This can be attributed to the company’s higher valuation when compared to its only listed peer, making it challenging for investors to justify any frantic applying in IPO Despite this, I feel, Swiggy’s sectoral opportunity, its market share, and readiness are undeniable. In principle, the company’s potential warrants attention. However, considering the prevailing stock market dynamics with respect to Swiggy, it’s advisable to allow the dust to settle. The scrip is currently dominated by traders lacking a clear opinion on the company’s value proposition. The modest listing gain supports this assessment. Long-term investors should await an opportune time to accumulate Swiggy shares. The company’s December quarter performance will be crucial in backing the issue with tangible numbers. A decent financial reporting will validate Swiggy’s potential as a good long-term hold. - Tarun Singh Founder & MD, Highbrow Securities Swiggy.jpeg Swiggy Ltd.jpeg GcPTWYyasAEYQAT.jpeg Swiggy Ltd.’s shares climbed in their Mumbai debut, signaling a vote of confidence for large initial public offerings in India. The food-delivery firm listed at 416.20 rupees, about 7% higher than the selling price of 390 rupees, the top of the marketed range. The shares traded at 444.65 rupees at 11:47 a.m. local time, valuing the company at just under $12 billion. The $1.3 billion sale, the nation’s second-largest listing this year after Hyundai Motor India Ltd.’s record $3.3 billion IPO, comes as global funds are dumping local shares on concerns over earnings growth. Initial demand for Swiggy’s IPO was subdued, but institutional demand on the final day drove it to a strong close. Swiggy’s IPO was seen as a test of investor appetite for the country’s burgeoning quick-commerce sector. The debut pits the company against larger listed rival Zomato and privately-held Zepto in India’s rapid delivery space. According to CLSA, these firms are set to top $78 billion in combined gross orders within a decade. “These companies already have a good presence and people have gotten used to ordering,” said Pranav Bhavsar, a co-founder of Trudence Capital Advisors Pvt. “It is hard to do away with that once you get used to it. That makes quick commerce a good theme to invest.” The listing defies the recent trend of weak performance among large first-time offerings in India. IPOs raising over $1 billion since 2019 have fallen by an average 3% on their first trading day, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares with an average 19% gain for all listings in the country for the period. Hyundai Motor India’s shares dipped on debut last month, and remain 12% below the IPO price. A handful more big listings are in the pipeline: state-backed NTPC Green Energy Ltd. is set to take bids for its up to $1.2 billion IPO next week. The Indian unit of LG Electronics Inc. and HDB Financial Services Ltd. are also gearing up for their debuts. “The India IPO market faces a cautious outlook following Hyundai’s underwhelming post-listing performance,” said Manish Bhargava, chief executive officer at Straits Investment Management in Singapore. “Investor skepticism is heightened, especially for startups with high valuations but uncertain profitability.” While Swiggy’s IPO attracted global funds including Fidelity International, the loss-making company faces challenges. Competition among quick commerce firms has caught the attention of India’s antitrust watchdog, which is investigating the company and Zomato for alleged unfair practices. Both the firms have said no final order has been issued. Fierce competition means increased spending on small-sized warehouses while “regulatory actions, such as welfare scheme for gig workers will be inflationary,” Macquarie Group analysts including Aditya Suresh wrote in a note. They initiated coverage with an underperform rating and a target of 325 rupees. Despite these hurdles, Swiggy’s growth is backed by strong online demand in one of the fastest-growing major economies. Its market share stood at about 37%, just behind Zomato’s 39% as of March 31, according to Chryseum Advisors, which tracks unlisted shares. “We see immense growth potential given quick commerce is essentially a play for the broader retail market, which was approximately $1 trillion in 2022,” JM Financial Institutional Securities Pvt. analysts wrote in a note. JM began coverage on Swiggy with a buy rating and a target of 470 rupees. The company was priced at about 40% discount to Zomato’s 12-month forward enterprise value to sales, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Zomato shares have more than doubled this year, with nearly all the 27 analysts covering the company recommending the stock as a buy. “Zomato trading up is providing a strong backdrop to Swiggy’s performance,” said Devi Subhakesan, an independent analyst from Investory Pte. Meanwhile, SoftBank Group Corp. and Prosus NV have more than doubled the value of their investments in Swiggy’s listing price. Prosus and its controlling shareholder Naspers Ltd. invested $1.3 billion building a 31% stake in Swiggy ahead of its debut. Bloomberg input Swiggy, India’s pioneering on-demand convenience platform backed by Prosus, has today listed on the National and Bombay Stock Exchanges of India (NSE and BSE), valuing the company at US$11.3 billion. Prosus sold shares worth more than US$500 million as part of the IPO. Prosus has been a cornerstone investor in Swiggy since 2017. Following the IPO, Prosus holds a c25%1 stake and maintains its two seats on the Board. Fabricio Bloisi, CEO of Prosus, said: “Everyone at Prosus extends huge congratulations to the Swiggy team on today’s IPO. We have supported the management team since our first investment in 2017 and have seen the company flourish in the post-pandemic era. It has diversified into new areas, expanded into new cities, and built an iconic consumer brand – placing Swiggy on a strong trajectory as a public company. Our investment in Swiggy highlights our commitment to building transformational companies and delivering returns for our shareholders by actively managing our portfolio. “India remains a key growth market for Prosus given the country’s impressive digital transformation in the consumer and enterprise sectors. We are excited about the region and see huge opportunity for value creation including a strong IPO pipeline within our current portfolio. Swiggy debuted at ₹420, marking a listing gain of 7.6%, which outpaced its grey market premium (GMP) estimate of just 0.26%. Retail investors showed modest interest, subscribing only 1.14 times, indicating low confidence. Current market conditions have kept many investors on the sidelines, especially as numerous high-quality companies remain 15-20% below their all-time highs. However, for those with a higher risk appetite, Swiggy could be an opportunity to capitalize on the valuation gap between Zomato and Swiggy, with potential gains hinging on Swiggy’s ability to enhance operational efficiency over time. - Gaurav Garg, Research Analyst at Lemonn Markets Desk GcPTWYyasAEYQAT.jpeg (Source: X/@NSEIndia) According to Shivani Nyati, Head of Wealth, Swastika Investmart Ltd., the listing reflects a degree of optimism about Swiggy’s long-term growth prospects, driven by its strong brand recognition, extensive network, and dominant position in the food delivery market. “However, the company’s continued losses and the challenging market conditions may temper investor enthusiasm in the long term,” Nyati added. Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities Ltd, advised allotted investors to hold for long-term despite knowing short-term volatility and competitive pressures in the sector. Global brokerage Macquarie has initiated coverage on Swiggy with an underperform rating at a target price of ₹325. Meanwhile, domestic brokerage JM Financial has initiated coverage on the stock with ‘buy’ call at a target price of ₹470. The brokerage emphasised that a duopoly structure should ensure steady growth and profits. JM Financial says it would prefer Zomato if asked to pick only one due to its superior execution in the past and market leadership across key segments, while on an absolute basis Swiggy offers decent upside. Madhu Balaji of businessline writes | ​Click to read​ Anand Daniel, Partner at Accel “As Swiggy hits the public bourses today, we at Accel reflect on the remarkable journey that Harsha, Nandan, and Phani, along with the Swiggy team, have undertaken. Being one of Swiggy’s first partners, when food delivery in India was still emerging, makes today especially meaningful. Guided by our thesis-led approach to food delivery, we were introduced to Harsha and his founding team in 2014—a connection that has since fueled countless innovations. This IPO is a testament to the grit, innovation, and consumer focus that Swiggy has consistently brought to the market. From ultra-fast grocery delivery with Instamart to ensuring safety and access during the pandemic, Swiggy has continually adapted to consumer needs with agility. Today’s IPO marks not only a milestone for Swiggy but a pivotal moment in India’s digital economy, impacting the daily lives of millions.” Swiggy shares rallied to hit day’s high at ₹449 on the NSE after listing at ₹420 today. Currently, as at 12.46 pm, the stock trades at ₹441.05, higher by 5.01%. While on an absolute basis Swiggy offers decent upside, we would prefer Zomato if asked to pick only one due to its superior execution in the past and market leadership across key segments. We, however, suggest that investors play both (preferably with higher weightage for Zomato), as in any case both are likely to be amongst the fastest growing consumption names and could, therefore, outperform the broader market returns. Despite subdued market mood and sluggish response from overall investors, Swiggy listing surprised the market participants. Positive listing and price holding above its issue price of 390 should be seen as strong demand for the company. This shows investors are positive on the space and fear of missing out factor is holding investors not to miss the sector growth story, similar to ZOMATO post listing trend. Post Listing: For allotted investors, HOLD FOR LONG TERM despite knowing short term volatility and competitive pressures in the sector. For non-allottees, we advise to wait and watch for the price to settle and revisit to buy near issue price if we get due to market selloff pressure. Swiggy, the leading food delivery and e-commerce platform in India, made a decent debut on the stock market, listing at around Rs 420, a 7.6% premium over its issue price of Rs 390. This performance is better than expected, considering the moderate subscription of 3.59 times and the initial muted investor response reflected in the low grey market premium. The listing reflects a degree of optimism about Swiggy’s long-term growth prospects, driven by its strong brand recognition, extensive network, and dominant position in the food delivery market. However, the company’s continued losses and the challenging market conditions may temper investor enthusiasm in the long term. Investors should approach Swiggy with a balanced perspective, considering the potential for future growth and the associated risks. Those who are holding it may keep a stop at around the issue price. ​​Swiggy shares​​ surged 6.58% on the NSE to trade at ₹447.65 as at 11.38 am.

Prosus and its controlling shareholder Naspers Ltd. have invested $1.3 billion building a 31% stake in Swiggy ahead of its stock market debut in India on Wednesday. The food delivery firm is targeting an initial public offering valuation of up to $11.3 billion. Prosus will sell down shares in the IPO and retain 25% of Swiggy, similar to its stake in Tencent, Prosus’s Chief Investment Officer Ervin Tu said an interview. The share sale is expected to generate a return of more than $500 million for Prosus, he added. “We expect to benefit from the upside of the business, and the tailwinds of the fast-growing Indian market in future,” Tu said, noting that Prosus has invested in several Indian companies that could list on public markets. Bloomberg report Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities Ltd, said: “We believe the majority of the investor especially NII’s & retail stayed back on few reason like Negative cash flow business model followed by concern on high competition and ongoing negative market mood. Considering low subscription demand from NII’s & Retail investors followed by market sentiments, there is a very high possibility of flat to negative listing in the range of +or - 5-10% on its issue price.” Track bl’s stock market live updates here Food tech major Swiggy’s IPO is set to unlock wealth to the tune of ₹9000 crore in employee stock ownership plan (Esop) wealth for its current and former employees, making it one of the largest wealth creation exercises of its kind in India’s startup ecosystem. Nearly 5,000 current and former employees are set to benefit, with around 500 Swiggy employees to enter the ‘crore-pati’ club when the firm makes its stock market debut, according to sources. Till date, Swiggy has has distributed ₹500 crore in Esops. In July this year, the company had announced its plan to buy back stocks worth up to $65 million. This kind of wealth creation by a new-age company is unmatched at this scale apart from Flipkart which hich has undertaken bigger scale of buyback or payouts in the past. In 2023, Flipkart had paid out a total of $700 million to 17,000 employees. Overall, Flipkart had over five share buybacks worth $1.4-1.5 billion in total over the past years. Swiggy’s founders and top management of Swiggy were allocated Esops worth nearly worth $271 million in its latest stock ownership plan. Investors probably won’t give a standing ovation for the e-commerce major’s market debut as they did when rival Zomato went public in 2021. Still, Swiggy can learn from Zomato’s epic stock meltdown the following year and an equally dramatic comeback since then. The best way for Swiggy to close the valuation gap with Zomato is to set clear profitability timeline and stick to the milestone targets. Investors love a good story, but Swiggy should bear in mind that these days, they’re quick to hit the sell button if earnings don’t meet estimates. Bloomberg input Food delivery and grocery major Swiggy’s initial public offering has been oversubscribed by 3.59 times after a tepid response in the first two days. The qualified institutional buyers (QIBs) portion was booked 6.02 times — the highest, NII portion was booked 41 per cent and the retail investor’s portion was subscribed 1.14 times. The employees’ book was subscribed 1.65 times. The ₹11,300-crore IPO comprises fresh capital raise of ₹4,499 crore and an offer for sale (OFS) of 17.51 shares worth ₹6,828 crore. Swiggy IPO price band has been set at ₹371-390 per share. The food delivery giant has raised ₹5,085 crore from institutional investors, including Fidelity and Blackrock, with sizeable participation from domestic investors. Shares of food delivery and grocery major ​Swiggy ​will be listed at the bourses today. The company has fixed the IPO price as Rs 370, at the upper end of the price band ₹371-390. The issue, which struggled on the first two days, sailed through with an​ oversubscription of 3.60 times​, thanks to QIB investors. Given the faltering of large IPOs such as LIC and Hyundai India, marketmen expect only a muted listing from Swiggy. The qualified institutional buyers (QIBs) portion was booked 6.02 times—the highest, and the retail investor’s portion was subscribed 1.14 times. The employees’ book was subscribed 1.65 times. However, wealthy individual investors (NIIs) remain lukewarm to the issue as the portion reserved for them remained undersubscribed at 0.41 times. ​KS Badri Narayanan of businessline writes​ Comments BACK TO TOP Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

On the listing day, Swiggy shares ended the trading session at ₹454 on NSE, nearly 17 per cent premium over IPO price of ₹390, and at ₹455.95 on BSE, a 16.9 per cent premium. Swiggy’s ₹11,300-crore-IPO was subscribed 3.59 times primarily driven by interest from institutional investors. The shares got listed on bourses at nearly 8 per cent premium.

Screenshot 2024-11-14 122343.png (NSE data show) Swiggy’s diversification strategy Swiggy’s revenue model spans multiple verticals, including its core food delivery service, Swiggy Instamart (grocery delivery), and Swiggy Genie (parcel delivery). This diverse service portfolio has helped Swiggy generate a gross revenue of ₹5,705 crore in the fiscal year 2023, representing a year-over-year growth of 40%. Swiggy Instamart alone contributed over ₹1,500 crore to Swiggy’s overall revenue, showcasing strong traction in the quick-commerce grocery sector. However, this broad approach comes with challenges. Swiggy’s operational expenses reached ₹7,280 crore in FY 2023, resulting in a net loss of ₹1,575 crore, a slight improvement from ₹1,850 crore in FY 2022. While Swiggy’s diversified model spreads risk, it also requires heavy capital investment, and the quick-commerce segment, in particular, has yet to show consistent profitability. Zomato’s focused business model Zomato, on the other hand, has opted to maintain a streamlined focus on food delivery, while experimenting selectively with quick-commerce following its acquisition of Blinkit. In FY 2023, Zomato reported a revenue of ₹6,300 crore, marking a 68% increase from ₹3,750 crore in FY 2022. Despite exiting grocery delivery early on, Zomato’s recent acquisition of Blinkit has contributed to its revenue and may provide additional growth potential if it successfully scales. Zomato’s net loss in FY 2023 was ₹450 crore, a notable improvement from ₹1,200 crore in FY 2022, reflecting its commitment to reducing operational inefficiencies and enhancing profitability. Unlike Swiggy, Zomato’s operating expenses were more concentrated, allowing it to streamline costs in food delivery. For investors, Zomato’s focused approach, coupled with this reduced net loss, demonstrates potential for achieving profitability earlier than Swiggy. Profitability remains a major concern for both companies, though they have made strides toward improving their unit economics. Know more Quick commerce refers to the delivery of consumer items in 10-30 minutes. Blinkit, Zepto, Swiggy Instamart, and Flipkart Minutes are among the top quick commerce platforms in India.

Screenshot 2024-11-14 110145.png (NSE data) Swiggy Stock Listing by Bajaj Broking Research “Swiggy’s listing on the Indian stock market has stirred up notable excitement, but early trading volatility reveals investor caution. While there’s optimism about Swiggy’s potential to capture further market share in India’s Android evolving food delivery and quick commerce segments, the road to profitability may be bumpy. Swiggy has shown impressive growth potential, yet persistent losses over recent fiscal years signal challenges ahead. Investors may need to brace for a dynamic journey as the company seeks to balance expansion with sustainable financial performance.” Swiggy shares trade flat on the NSE at ₹454.35 as at 10.21 am after a fresh high at ₹489.40. Swiggy shares ​ended the listing day trading session ​at ₹464 on NSE, an 18.97 per cent premium to the IPO price of ₹390, and at ₹455.95 on BSE, a 16.9 per cent premium.

With Swiggy listing on the stock exchanges on November 13 at a premium, the debate intensifies over whether Swiggy or Zomato offers the better investment in India’s booming food delivery market Investors are keenly comparing Swiggy to its main competitor, Zomato, which has already experienced two years in the public market. Both companies are key players in India’s food delivery industry, valued at approximately $4.5 billion in 2023 and projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 25% over the next five years. This analysis compares the financials, growth potential, and strategic directions of Swiggy and Zomato, shedding light on which platform may offer stronger returns. Market position and financial performance Both Swiggy and Zomato have carved out significant shares in the Indian market, with Zomato accounting for approximately 55% and Swiggy for about 45% of the market by 2023. However, the companies differ significantly in revenue composition and business models, which influence their respective investment potential. Track bl’s stock market live updates here Instamart essentially a play on broader retail; has immense potential to grow: We see immense growth potential in Instamart given QC is essentially a play on the broader retail market, which was sized at ~USD 1trln in CY22. While Swiggy tested the dark store-led business model first, sudden rise in competition and better execution by competition did lead to market share erosion. Despite that, in GOV terms, we estimate Instamart was only behind Blinkit as of FY24, with a market share of ~28%. Moreover, the QC channel penetration within the broader retail market even today is barely ~0.35%, compared to ~5-6% e-retail penetration. Even assuming the QC channel penetration will reach only 1.5-2% over the next 5 years, the market can expand at >50% CAGR. This will ensure exponential GOV/Revenue growth for Instamart over the medium term. Moreover, the QC business model has enough operating leverage to turn self-sustainable, when operating at scale. Screenshot 2024-11-13 143942.png Swiggy shares traded at ₹443 on the NSE, higher by 5.48% as at 2.17 pm. On the BSE, the stock climbed 7.91% to ₹444.60. Swiggy’s listing underscores the dominance of short-term subscribers, evident in the lukewarm participation from Non-Institutional Investors (NIIs) and subdued retail interest. This can be attributed to the company’s higher valuation when compared to its only listed peer, making it challenging for investors to justify any frantic applying in IPO Despite this, I feel, Swiggy’s sectoral opportunity, its market share, and readiness are undeniable. In principle, the company’s potential warrants attention. However, considering the prevailing stock market dynamics with respect to Swiggy, it’s advisable to allow the dust to settle. The scrip is currently dominated by traders lacking a clear opinion on the company’s value proposition. The modest listing gain supports this assessment. Long-term investors should await an opportune time to accumulate Swiggy shares. The company’s December quarter performance will be crucial in backing the issue with tangible numbers. A decent financial reporting will validate Swiggy’s potential as a good long-term hold. - Tarun Singh Founder & MD, Highbrow Securities Swiggy.jpeg Swiggy Ltd.jpeg GcPTWYyasAEYQAT.jpeg Swiggy Ltd.’s shares climbed in their Mumbai debut, signaling a vote of confidence for large initial public offerings in India. The food-delivery firm listed at 416.20 rupees, about 7% higher than the selling price of 390 rupees, the top of the marketed range. The shares traded at 444.65 rupees at 11:47 a.m. local time, valuing the company at just under $12 billion. The $1.3 billion sale, the nation’s second-largest listing this year after Hyundai Motor India Ltd.’s record $3.3 billion IPO, comes as global funds are dumping local shares on concerns over earnings growth. Initial demand for Swiggy’s IPO was subdued, but institutional demand on the final day drove it to a strong close. Swiggy’s IPO was seen as a test of investor appetite for the country’s burgeoning quick-commerce sector. The debut pits the company against larger listed rival Zomato and privately-held Zepto in India’s rapid delivery space. According to CLSA, these firms are set to top $78 billion in combined gross orders within a decade. “These companies already have a good presence and people have gotten used to ordering,” said Pranav Bhavsar, a co-founder of Trudence Capital Advisors Pvt. “It is hard to do away with that once you get used to it. That makes quick commerce a good theme to invest.” The listing defies the recent trend of weak performance among large first-time offerings in India. IPOs raising over $1 billion since 2019 have fallen by an average 3% on their first trading day, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares with an average 19% gain for all listings in the country for the period. Hyundai Motor India’s shares dipped on debut last month, and remain 12% below the IPO price. A handful more big listings are in the pipeline: state-backed NTPC Green Energy Ltd. is set to take bids for its up to $1.2 billion IPO next week. The Indian unit of LG Electronics Inc. and HDB Financial Services Ltd. are also gearing up for their debuts. “The India IPO market faces a cautious outlook following Hyundai’s underwhelming post-listing performance,” said Manish Bhargava, chief executive officer at Straits Investment Management in Singapore. “Investor skepticism is heightened, especially for startups with high valuations but uncertain profitability.” While Swiggy’s IPO attracted global funds including Fidelity International, the loss-making company faces challenges. Competition among quick commerce firms has caught the attention of India’s antitrust watchdog, which is investigating the company and Zomato for alleged unfair practices. Both the firms have said no final order has been issued. Fierce competition means increased spending on small-sized warehouses while “regulatory actions, such as welfare scheme for gig workers will be inflationary,” Macquarie Group analysts including Aditya Suresh wrote in a note. They initiated coverage with an underperform rating and a target of 325 rupees. Despite these hurdles, Swiggy’s growth is backed by strong online demand in one of the fastest-growing major economies. Its market share stood at about 37%, just behind Zomato’s 39% as of March 31, according to Chryseum Advisors, which tracks unlisted shares. “We see immense growth potential given quick commerce is essentially a play for the broader retail market, which was approximately $1 trillion in 2022,” JM Financial Institutional Securities Pvt. analysts wrote in a note. JM began coverage on Swiggy with a buy rating and a target of 470 rupees. The company was priced at about 40% discount to Zomato’s 12-month forward enterprise value to sales, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Zomato shares have more than doubled this year, with nearly all the 27 analysts covering the company recommending the stock as a buy. “Zomato trading up is providing a strong backdrop to Swiggy’s performance,” said Devi Subhakesan, an independent analyst from Investory Pte. Meanwhile, SoftBank Group Corp. and Prosus NV have more than doubled the value of their investments in Swiggy’s listing price. Prosus and its controlling shareholder Naspers Ltd. invested $1.3 billion building a 31% stake in Swiggy ahead of its debut. Bloomberg input Swiggy, India’s pioneering on-demand convenience platform backed by Prosus, has today listed on the National and Bombay Stock Exchanges of India (NSE and BSE), valuing the company at US$11.3 billion. Prosus sold shares worth more than US$500 million as part of the IPO. Prosus has been a cornerstone investor in Swiggy since 2017. Following the IPO, Prosus holds a c25%1 stake and maintains its two seats on the Board. Fabricio Bloisi, CEO of Prosus, said: “Everyone at Prosus extends huge congratulations to the Swiggy team on today’s IPO. We have supported the management team since our first investment in 2017 and have seen the company flourish in the post-pandemic era. It has diversified into new areas, expanded into new cities, and built an iconic consumer brand – placing Swiggy on a strong trajectory as a public company. Our investment in Swiggy highlights our commitment to building transformational companies and delivering returns for our shareholders by actively managing our portfolio. “India remains a key growth market for Prosus given the country’s impressive digital transformation in the consumer and enterprise sectors. We are excited about the region and see huge opportunity for value creation including a strong IPO pipeline within our current portfolio. Swiggy debuted at ₹420, marking a listing gain of 7.6%, which outpaced its grey market premium (GMP) estimate of just 0.26%. Retail investors showed modest interest, subscribing only 1.14 times, indicating low confidence. Current market conditions have kept many investors on the sidelines, especially as numerous high-quality companies remain 15-20% below their all-time highs. However, for those with a higher risk appetite, Swiggy could be an opportunity to capitalize on the valuation gap between Zomato and Swiggy, with potential gains hinging on Swiggy’s ability to enhance operational efficiency over time. - Gaurav Garg, Research Analyst at Lemonn Markets Desk GcPTWYyasAEYQAT.jpeg (Source: X/@NSEIndia) According to Shivani Nyati, Head of Wealth, Swastika Investmart Ltd., the listing reflects a degree of optimism about Swiggy’s long-term growth prospects, driven by its strong brand recognition, extensive network, and dominant position in the food delivery market. “However, the company’s continued losses and the challenging market conditions may temper investor enthusiasm in the long term,” Nyati added. Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities Ltd, advised allotted investors to hold for long-term despite knowing short-term volatility and competitive pressures in the sector. Global brokerage Macquarie has initiated coverage on Swiggy with an underperform rating at a target price of ₹325. Meanwhile, domestic brokerage JM Financial has initiated coverage on the stock with ‘buy’ call at a target price of ₹470. The brokerage emphasised that a duopoly structure should ensure steady growth and profits. JM Financial says it would prefer Zomato if asked to pick only one due to its superior execution in the past and market leadership across key segments, while on an absolute basis Swiggy offers decent upside. Madhu Balaji of businessline writes | ​Click to read​ Anand Daniel, Partner at Accel “As Swiggy hits the public bourses today, we at Accel reflect on the remarkable journey that Harsha, Nandan, and Phani, along with the Swiggy team, have undertaken. Being one of Swiggy’s first partners, when food delivery in India was still emerging, makes today especially meaningful. Guided by our thesis-led approach to food delivery, we were introduced to Harsha and his founding team in 2014—a connection that has since fueled countless innovations. This IPO is a testament to the grit, innovation, and consumer focus that Swiggy has consistently brought to the market. From ultra-fast grocery delivery with Instamart to ensuring safety and access during the pandemic, Swiggy has continually adapted to consumer needs with agility. Today’s IPO marks not only a milestone for Swiggy but a pivotal moment in India’s digital economy, impacting the daily lives of millions.” Swiggy shares rallied to hit day’s high at ₹449 on the NSE after listing at ₹420 today. Currently, as at 12.46 pm, the stock trades at ₹441.05, higher by 5.01%. While on an absolute basis Swiggy offers decent upside, we would prefer Zomato if asked to pick only one due to its superior execution in the past and market leadership across key segments. We, however, suggest that investors play both (preferably with higher weightage for Zomato), as in any case both are likely to be amongst the fastest growing consumption names and could, therefore, outperform the broader market returns. Despite subdued market mood and sluggish response from overall investors, Swiggy listing surprised the market participants. Positive listing and price holding above its issue price of 390 should be seen as strong demand for the company. This shows investors are positive on the space and fear of missing out factor is holding investors not to miss the sector growth story, similar to ZOMATO post listing trend. Post Listing: For allotted investors, HOLD FOR LONG TERM despite knowing short term volatility and competitive pressures in the sector. For non-allottees, we advise to wait and watch for the price to settle and revisit to buy near issue price if we get due to market selloff pressure. Swiggy, the leading food delivery and e-commerce platform in India, made a decent debut on the stock market, listing at around Rs 420, a 7.6% premium over its issue price of Rs 390. This performance is better than expected, considering the moderate subscription of 3.59 times and the initial muted investor response reflected in the low grey market premium. The listing reflects a degree of optimism about Swiggy’s long-term growth prospects, driven by its strong brand recognition, extensive network, and dominant position in the food delivery market. However, the company’s continued losses and the challenging market conditions may temper investor enthusiasm in the long term. Investors should approach Swiggy with a balanced perspective, considering the potential for future growth and the associated risks. Those who are holding it may keep a stop at around the issue price. ​​Swiggy shares​​ surged 6.58% on the NSE to trade at ₹447.65 as at 11.38 am. On the BSE, the stock climbed 8.65% to ₹447.65 JMFinancial on Swiggy Initiate Buy with TP of Rs 470 Food delivery – duopoly structure should ensure steady growth and profits Instamart essentially a play on broader retail; has immense potential to grow On an absolute basis Swiggy offers decent upside, but we would prefer Zomato if asked to pick only one Zomato over Swiggy due to its superior execution in the past and market leadership across key segments Suggest that investors play both (preferably with higher weightage for Zomato), as in any case both are likely to be amongst the fastest growing consumption names Initiate U-P, TP Rs 325 India’s no-2 consumer app(FD, Quick Com, Out-of-Home), has a clear path to catch up with leader Zomato Quick Com more complex, with no sustainable economic profits Expect Group EBIT breakeven in FY28E even with 23% core rev CAGR Swiggy shares climbed 4.58% on the NSE to trade at ₹439.25 as at 11.05 am.

Swiggy shares debuted on the NSE at ₹420, at a 7.6% premium over the issue price of ₹390.

Prosus and its controlling shareholder Naspers Ltd. have invested $1.3 billion building a 31% stake in Swiggy ahead of its stock market debut in India on Wednesday. The food delivery firm is targeting an initial public offering valuation of up to $11.3 billion. Prosus will sell down shares in the IPO and retain 25% of Swiggy, similar to its stake in Tencent, Prosus’s Chief Investment Officer Ervin Tu said an interview. The share sale is expected to generate a return of more than $500 million for Prosus, he added. “We expect to benefit from the upside of the business, and the tailwinds of the fast-growing Indian market in future,” Tu said, noting that Prosus has invested in several Indian companies that could list on public markets. Bloomberg report Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities Ltd, said: “We believe the majority of the investor especially NII’s & retail stayed back on few reason like Negative cash flow business model followed by concern on high competition and ongoing negative market mood. Considering low subscription demand from NII’s & Retail investors followed by market sentiments, there is a very high possibility of flat to negative listing in the range of +or - 5-10% on its issue price.” Track bl’s stock market live updates here Food tech major Swiggy’s IPO is set to unlock wealth to the tune of ₹9000 crore in employee stock ownership plan (Esop) wealth for its current and former employees, making it one of the largest wealth creation exercises of its kind in India’s startup ecosystem. Nearly 5,000 current and former employees are set to benefit, with around 500 Swiggy employees to enter the ‘crore-pati’ club when the firm makes its stock market debut, according to sources. Till date, Swiggy has has distributed ₹500 crore in Esops. In July this year, the company had announced its plan to buy back stocks worth up to $65 million. This kind of wealth creation by a new-age company is unmatched at this scale apart from Flipkart which hich has undertaken bigger scale of buyback or payouts in the past. In 2023, Flipkart had paid out a total of $700 million to 17,000 employees. Overall, Flipkart had over five share buybacks worth $1.4-1.5 billion in total over the past years. Swiggy’s founders and top management of Swiggy were allocated Esops worth nearly worth $271 million in its latest stock ownership plan. Investors probably won’t give a standing ovation for the e-commerce major’s market debut as they did when rival Zomato went public in 2021. Still, Swiggy can learn from Zomato’s epic stock meltdown the following year and an equally dramatic comeback since then. The best way for Swiggy to close the valuation gap with Zomato is to set clear profitability timeline and stick to the milestone targets. Investors love a good story, but Swiggy should bear in mind that these days, they’re quick to hit the sell button if earnings don’t meet estimates. Bloomberg input Food delivery and grocery major Swiggy’s initial public offering has been oversubscribed by 3.59 times after a tepid response in the first two days. The qualified institutional buyers (QIBs) portion was booked 6.02 times — the highest, NII portion was booked 41 per cent and the retail investor’s portion was subscribed 1.14 times. The employees’ book was subscribed 1.65 times. The ₹11,300-crore IPO comprises fresh capital raise of ₹4,499 crore and an offer for sale (OFS) of 17.51 shares worth ₹6,828 crore. Swiggy IPO price band has been set at ₹371-390 per share. The food delivery giant has raised ₹5,085 crore from institutional investors, including Fidelity and Blackrock, with sizeable participation from domestic investors. Shares of food delivery and grocery major ​Swiggy ​will be listed at the bourses today. The company has fixed the IPO price as Rs 370, at the upper end of the price band ₹371-390. The issue, which struggled on the first two days, sailed through with an​ oversubscription of 3.60 times​, thanks to QIB investors. Given the faltering of large IPOs such as LIC and Hyundai India, marketmen expect only a muted listing from Swiggy. The qualified institutional buyers (QIBs) portion was booked 6.02 times—the highest, and the retail investor’s portion was subscribed 1.14 times. The employees’ book was subscribed 1.65 times. However, wealthy individual investors (NIIs) remain lukewarm to the issue as the portion reserved for them remained undersubscribed at 0.41 times. ​KS Badri Narayanan of businessline writes​ Comments BACK TO TOP Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

Title: Elastic N.V. (ESTC) Unveils ‘Better Binary Quantization’ to Enhance Elasticsearch for AI and Machine Learning Data Processing

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI News That Should Not Be Ignored. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Elastic N.V. (NYSE:ESTC) stands against the other AI stocks that should not be ignored. Artificial Intelligence is driving an unprecedented expansion in the potential market size for hardware and software products. According to Bain & Company, the market for AI-related hardware and software will witness annual growth rates of 40% to 55% over the next three years, potentially reaching a valuation between $780 billion and $990 billion by 2027. Companies investing in artificial intelligence know exactly how big of an opportunity this is and are determined not to miss it. Keshav Murugesh, Group CEO of WNS, a global business process management company, talked about its significance at the “CNBC Connect” event in Bangkok. According to Murugesh, many companies are underprepared for AI’s impact, particularly in areas such as government regulation. As such, there is clearly an upside to investing early in the technology. “Three years from now, if you are investing significantly in generative AI, you might be disappointed, right? As we have seen in many technologies, sometimes the hype is much bigger than the reality. But, three years from now if you are not investing in generative AI, you are going to be terrified. Because those companies that made the investments now, will be far ahead of you”. READ ALSO: 10 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News and 8 Best Information Technology Services Stocks to Invest in Now Let’s look at the latest developments in artificial intelligence to assess how they are helping businesses, customers, and society to reach the next level of success. In its first, Chinese scientists have developed the first AI-powered robot lifeguard to stand watch over the riverside site in Luohe city. Using artificial intelligence, big data, and navigation and tracking technologies, the robot will operate without any human intervention. While it is not the first robot lifeguard, it is the first to be fully automated and needs no intervention, South China Morning Post reported. In other news, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has pledged more than $65 billion of fresh support for the nation’s semiconductor and artificial intelligence sector. The move comes in hopes of narrowing the gap between Tokyo and global powers on chip support. Ishiba notes that he wishes to spread positive examples of regional revitalization like TSMC’s chip plant in Kumamoto across the nation. Speaking of artificial intelligence, it seems that artificial intelligence companies are no longer scaling at the pace they were initially and that the outcomes from scaling up pre-training—the stage in AI model training where large volumes of unlabeled data are used to learn language patterns and structures—have seemingly reached a plateau. To overcome this plateau, researchers are now exploring “test-time compute,” a technique that enhances existing AI models during the so-called “inference” phase, or when the model is being used. This shift has the potential to reshape the AI landscape and impact the demand for hardware, challenging Nvidia’s dominance in training chips as the focus moves to the inference market. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A group of software engineers working in an open, futuristic office. Market Capitalization: $9.24 billion Elastic N.V. (NYSE:ESTC) is a search artificial intelligence (AI) company that delivers hosted and managed solutions designed to run in hybrid, public or private clouds, and multi-cloud environments. The company leverages AI across its product offerings, particularly within its “Elastic Stack” comprising Elasticsearch, Kibana, Beats, and Logstash (also known as the ELK Stack) and more. On November 11, Elastic N.V. (NYSE:ESTC) introduced a new feature called Better Binary Quantization (BBQ) for Elasticsearch, the company’s open-source search and analytics engine. The BBQ tool will make it easier to store and work with complex data types known as vectors, which are often used in artificial intelligence and machine learning. The development of BBQ is a significant step toward data processing and storage, enhancing the capabilities of Elasticsearch. It is available as a tech preview for both self-managed and cloud users of Elasticsearch and will be contributed to Apache Lucene, an open-source Java library used as a search engine. Elasticsearch is built on top of Lucene. “Elasticsearch is evolving to become one of the best vector databases in the world, and we see our users wanting to put more and more vectorized data in it. Better Binary Quantization is our latest innovation to reduce the resources needed to store vectorized data and provide freedom to our users to vectorize all the things.” Overall ESTC ranks 13th on our list of the AI stocks that should not be ignored. While we acknowledge the potential of ESTC as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ESTC but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Chinese EV firm swoops on German flying taxi start-up

An aircraft from the Baden-based air cab manufacturer Volocopter with the ADAC logo is parked on the airfield in August. Photo: Getty Chinese conglomerate Geely is in advanced talks to take control of Germany’s Volocopter in a deal that would save the flying taxi start-up from potential bankruptcy, according to people familiar with the talks. Zhejiang Geely Holding Group has discussed taking a majority stake in Volocopter by leading a consortium that will inject fresh capital into the company, said the people, asking not to be identified discussing private matters. The funding round would be about $95m (€89.6m) in exchange for roughly 85pc ownership, said one of the people. The family office of German industrialist Gerhard Sturm would also participate in the deal, the person said. If completed, the deal would slash the start-up’s valuation from a peak of $1.9bn in 2022 to about $110m. The Geely group is working through due diligence and aims to finish next month. Volocopter has also held discussions with other potential bidders. No final decisions on the terms have been made and the deal could still fall apart. Volocopter’s financial troubles show the fraught effort to make flying cars a reality in the US and Europe, where start-ups often collapse before they’re able to sell a single ride. In China, however, the government has made boosting the “low-altitude” economy a priority, along with an electric vehicle industry that is bombarding Germany’s automakers with competition. A Geely spokesperson declined to comment. Sturm’s office didn’t respond to a request for comment. “Due to ongoing financing and contractual obligations, we will not disclose investor names, amounts raised, or any predictions for the future,” a representative for Volocopter said. With the Geely deal, Volocopter is weighing moving the manufacturing of its future aircraft to China, the people said. Its current, smaller model is being built in Germany. The Volocopter representative said it considers the German facility a “reference facility” for working out efficient production practices. That will give the company a blueprint for scaling up as it expands overseas, she added. Formed in 2011, Volocopter was among a raft of start-ups developing electric vertical take-off and landing, or what the industry called EVTOL. It raised $600m from German firms and global investors, including Mercedes-Benz Group, DB Schenker, Blackrock and Neom, Saudi Arabia’s futuristic city project. The start-up burned through cash and swapped out its chief executive in 2022. Volocopter planned to debut its first commercial aircraft, a two-seater called the VoloCity, at the Olympics this summer in Paris. But it missed the deadline.

On a chilly and crisp autumnal day, mourners at the Church of the Sacred Heart in Donnybrook, south Dublin, heard about “a truly remarkable woman” who had a “speaking voice of silk”. Tribute was paid to the talented broadcaster, writer and musician, who died at the age of 90 last Friday. It came five years after her famous husband’s passing on November 4, 2019. Kathleen Watkins at the InterContinental Hotel in Ballsbridge. Photo: Steve Humphreys As was fitting for someone renowned for her love of the arts, her funeral mass included classical music pieces chosen by Kathleen herself, along with extracts from her favourite poems. Among those in attendance were RTÉ figures such as Marty Whelan, Mary Kennedy, Dave Fanning, Joe Duffy, Ray D’Arcy, Mike Murphy and Olivia O’Leary. Kevin Bakhurst, the RTÉ director-general, was also in attendance, alongside Riverdance co-founder Moya Doherty, film producer John McColgan and presenter Pat Kenny. Suzy Byrne (second from left) with family members including her sister Crona Byrne (right) after their mother’s funeral. Photos: Steve Humphreys During the funeral mass, officiated by Fr Leonard Moloney, daughter Suzy told the congregation how her mum was “a lady”. “She was full of grace, gentility and love. Her life was dominated by four words – family, friendship, faith and fun,” she said. A mother to Suzy and Crona and grandmother to five, she had died peacefully at Blackrock Clinic at her favourite time of the day, which was dawn. Kathleen had many monikers over the years but her fondest one was that of ‘Nana Kit’. Suzy said that when she told her parents she was pregnant, Gay said her mother was “speechless for the first time in her life”. “Then she spoke. ‘From today, I will answer to all as Nana Kit.’ I laughed, saying, ‘Mum, I have seven months to go’. Her only response: ‘I am Nana Kit now.’” As soon as her first grandson Cian arrived, she was “besotted”. He was joined by grandchildren Sadhbh, Kate, Saoirse and Harry. She had a “magical place in her heart” for children, Suzy said. Joe Duffy (left) outside the church with fellow mourners. Photo: Steve Humphreys Being a grandmother inspired her to create a series of popular children’s books, Pigín of Howth. “It was through piglet that Nana Kit educated our children on so many levels, by making it fun and telling them stories. It’s hard to illustrate how precious these Sundays were “We watched in awe as the children hung on her every word. Through Pigín and co, Nana Kit was a grandmother to a nation of children. Our children shared her as Nana Kit, just as myself and Crona shared both Mum and Dad as we grew up.” Most treasured of all were those lazy Sundays with Suzy’s family at their old home in Howth, having moved to Sandymount in recent years. “It started off as a late lunch but quickly became all day,” she said. “It’s hard to illustrate how precious these Sundays were. Their visits defined our week as a family. We slipped easily into the tradition of the full Sunday roast, the ritual of sitting around for hours, just chatting.” John McColgan and Moya Doherty at the funeral of Kathleen Watkins. Photo: Collins Kathleen placed an emphasis on her friendships. After the loss of her “soulmate” Gay, she turned to her circle of pals who “welcomed her with open arms”. Having asked one of them for a memory of her mother, she recalled it was “one of beauty – beauty of face, beauty of demeanour, of action and reaction”. “Today, we remember with love and gratitude our mother, our Nana Kit and your friend,” she said. “Mum had great faith. She knew without question that she would be reunited with Dad when she left us. Spiritually, she believed first and foremost in love. If you have love, you will have joy. With those, you have enough. “Today, I say goodbye to my mother and my closest friend. I never knew a day without her in it. How lucky I am to be able to say that. God granted her a peaceful death at the end of an incredible life. She gave us all such joy and love. We will have that forever.” Fr Leonard said she was a “woman of empathy and compassion” and spoke of her long marriage of 55 years. They were loved, both of them “Ireland doesn’t do monarchs. But if we did, I do think Gay and Kathleen would have been contenders for the crown. They were loved, both of them,” he said. As well as being RTÉ’s first continuity announcer, she was also a talented harpist and folk singer and inspired granddaughter Sadhbh to take up the harp. Former presenter Pat Kenny. Photo: Steve Humphreys You could hear a pin drop as Sadhbh played a tribute to her grandmother with a rendition of Eleanor Plunkett. As was her wish, as indicated in her last-ever interview with the Sunday Independent, Frank McNamara performed Pie Jesu during Communion before Gabriel’s Oboe. Grandson Cian brought the mass to a close with a final reflection on his esteemed grandmother. She had advised him to “always give people your time”. “It is the most precious gift of all and you should always give people the benefit of the doubt as you never know what anyone is going through,” he said. Her remains were taken for a private burial before mourners were invited to toast her eventful life at her and Gay’s favourite spot, the Intercontinental hotel.

The company has fixed the IPO price as ₹370, at the upper end of the price band ₹371-390. The issue, which struggled on the first two days, sailed through with an oversubscription of 3.60 times, thanks to QIB investors. Given the faltering of large IPOs such as LIC and Hyundai India, marketmen expect only a muted listing from Swiggy. The qualified institutional buyers (QIBs) portion was booked 6.02 times—the highest, and the retail investor’s portion was subscribed 1.14 times. The employees’ book was subscribed 1.65 times. However, wealthy individual investors (NIIs) remain lukewarm to the issue as the portion reserved for them remained undersubscribed at 0.41 times. Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities Ltd, said: “We believe the majority of the investor especially NII’s & retail stayed back on few reason like Negative cash flow business model followed by concern on high competition and ongoing negative market mood. Considering low subscription demand from NII’s & Retail investors followed by market sentiments, there is a very high possibility of flat to negative listing in the range of +or - 5-10% on its issue price.” The Rs. 11,300-crore IPO comprised a fresh capital of ₹4,499 crore and an offer for sale (OFS) of 17.51 shares worth ₹ 6,828 crore. The food delivery major raised ₹5,085 crore from institutional investors through the anchor book. Among the investors who were allocated shares are New World Fund Inc, Government Pension Fund Global, Nomura Funds Ireland Public Limited Company, Fidelity Funds, BlackRock, Allianz Global Investors Fund and Schroder International, according to a circular uploaded on BSE’s website. ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund (MF), SBI Mutual Fund, HDFC Life Insurance Company Ltd, SBI Life Insurance Co. Ltd, and ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company Ltd were also allotted shares in the anchor round. Swiggy’s upper price band valuation is estimated at around ₹95,000 crore. In comparison, rival Zomato, which went public in July 2021, currently has a market valuation of ₹2.25 lakh crore. Swiggy plans to use the IPO proceeds to fund investments in the Material Subsidiary, Scootsy, technology and cloud infrastructure investments, brand marketing and business promotion expenses to enhance the brand awareness and visibility of its platform across segments, and inorganic growth through unidentified acquisitions and general corporate purposes. “Post Listing: For allotted investors, one should not expect any kind of listing gains. Hence, only risky investors should consider the company to HOLD FOR LONG TREM despite knowing short term volatility and competitive pressures in the sector. For non-allottees, we advise to wait and watch for the price to settle and revisit the space with better discounted opportunity,” said Tapse. Swiggy is an online food delivery platform that emerged in India in 2014. It offers a convenient solution for ordering food from various restaurants. The company operates five business units: Food Delivery, out-of-home consumption, including restaurant visits and events; Quick Commerce, offering on-demand delivery of groceries and household items; supply chain and distribution, providing B2B deliveries, warehousing, logistics, and distribution for wholesalers and retailers; and platform innovation, introducing new services like Swiggy Genie and Swiggy Minis. Kotak Mahindra Capital Company, Citigroup Global Markets India, Jefferies India, Avendus Capital, J.P. Morgan India, BoFA Securities India, and ICICI Securities were the book-running lead managers of the IPO. Comments BACK TO TOP Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

Title: Is Block, Inc. (SQ) the Best Cryptocurrency Stock to Buy According to Wall Street?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Cryptocurrency Stocks to Buy According to Wall Street. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) stands against the other cryptocurrency stocks. Post Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential elections, the price of bitcoin rose above $80,000 for the first time ever. Other cryptocurrencies such as dogecoin which is the favorite coin of Elon Musk, a strong Trump supporter, are also posting gains, as reported by BBC. On November 12, Bitcoin neared a record $90,000. While Trump has revealed his plans to make America the crypto capital of the world, he has stated that he would be sacking the current chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler, who has led the SEC's crackdown on the crypto market. Gensler tried to regulate the market which he believed, was at least partially made up of securities trading illegally. Market analyst at StoneX Financial, Matt Simpson, emphasized that bitcoin prices could go as high as $100,000 in case the Trump administration deregulates crypto. Although Trump was once railing against cryptocurrencies, he later embraced crypto as he started a new crypto business called World Liberty Financial in September. While commenting on the crypto industry, he said “It’s very young and very growing” and that he believes in it. He has also expressed support for domestic Bitcoin miners saying that if crypto is going to define the future, he wants it to be mined, minted, and made in the US. Bitcoin has surged more than 26% since election day on November 5. As reported by CNBC, Mike Colonnese, an analyst at H.C. Wainwright, stated: “Bitcoin is now in price discovery mode after breaking through all-time highs early last Wednesday morning when it was officially declared that Trump won the election. Strong positive sentiment is likely to persist through the balance of 2024 and [we] see bitcoin prices potentially reaching the six-figure mark by the end of this year.” As the crypto market anticipates a positive and bright regulatory climate under the Trump administration, crypto-focused stocks also surged post-election. Vice President and General Manager of Robinhood, Johann Kerbrat, appeared on CNBC and referred to the post-election scenario as a big moment for the firm on the crypto side considering bitcoin was not even a fraction of its current price two years ago. The firm saw a lot of activity on the crypto volume. While the company has faced scrutiny from the SEC under the Biden administration, Kerbrat is hopeful to see more crypto-friendly policymaking. Bitwise’s Matt Hougan seconded this stance when he appeared on CNBC Crypto World on November 12. In his opinion, Trump’s economic policies should be positive for crypto. He referred to the prevailing market as a golden age of crypto and that it’s right to be bullish. While he thinks that crypto has been fighting with one hand tied behind its back during the past four years and has faced a lot of regulatory unclarity, the scenario has shifted 180 degrees with a positive regulatory environment to look forward to. Finally, Hougan calls the market a win-win post-election. Regarding the future outlook for Bitcoin, he states that there is a clear path right up to $100,000 by 2024’s end while $200,000 is completely reasonable for 2025, considering that the trend is up and is going to stay intact for a while. Our Methodology: In order to compile a list of the 12 best cryptocurrency stocks to buy according to Wall Street, we first utilized stock screeners, ETFs, and online rankings to make an extended list of the major crypto companies. Moving on, we shortlisted the top 12 stocks from our list which had the highest upside potential, as of November 12. The 12 best cryptocurrency stocks to buy according to Wall Street have been arranged in ascending order of their average upside potential. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). People using the Cash App paying for goods and services, highlighting the impact the of the company's payment tools. Average Upside Potential: 8.25% Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) is a technology company that focuses on financial services and helps expand access to the economy. Block comprises Square, Cash App, Spiral, TIDAL, and TBD. Square offers an integrated ecosystem of commerce solutions, business software, and banking services for sellers to grow their business while Cash App allows sending, spending, or investing money in stocks or bitcoin. Spiral advances the use of Bitcoin by building and funding free, open-source projects whereas TIDAL is a platform for musicians and their fans. TBD eases access to Bitcoin and other blockchain technologies. Block, Inc.’s (NYSE:SQ) growth remains at scale with rising profitability. The core businesses are robust with adjusted operating income margins growing significantly for both Square and Cash App. The firm has also expanded its addressable market over time. With Square representing a nearly $130 billion gross profit opportunity and Cash App representing a nearly $75 billion gross profit opportunity in the US, the market potential is strong. The strong profitable growth across Block depicts that its ecosystems are efficiently delivering differentiated value to its customers. The firm has also shifted to a functional organizational structure to improve collaboration across ecosystems. In the third quarter, the firm’s gross profit rose 19% year-over-year to $2.25 billion. Square generated a gross profit of $932 million, up 16% year-over-year, due to strength in its software and integrated payments and banking products. Cash App generated a gross profit of $1.31 billion, up 21% year-over-year, driven by strong performance across Cash App Card, Cash App Borrow, and BNPL platform. Overall, the firm delivered year-over-year improvement across all profitability measures including adjusted EBITDA. The company’s potential for continued growth and profitability across its key businesses, its ability to generate substantial free cash flow, and its strategic shift to a functional organizational structure make it attractive to investors. Overall SQ ranks 11th on our list of the best cryptocurrency stocks to buy according to Wall Street. While we acknowledge the potential of SQ as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than SQ but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Search, Blackrock, iBit, BTF, Bitcoin ETF fund surpassing their gold one?

Written by in . BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has recently surpassed its iShares Gold Trust (IAU) in assets under management (AUM). As of November 7, 2024, IBIT’s AUM reached $33.17 billion, slightly exceeding IAU’s $32.96 billion. This milestone is notable given that IBIT was launched in January 2024, while IAU has been available since 2005. The rapid growth of IBIT reflects increasing investor interest in Bitcoin as a digital asset. The surge in IBIT’s AUM coincides with a significant rise in Bitcoin’s price, which has recently reached new all-time highs. This trend suggests a growing acceptance of Bitcoin ETFs among investors seeking exposure to cryptocurrencies through traditional financial instruments. In comparison, ProShares’ Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BTF), which invests in Bitcoin futures contracts, has also experienced growth but remains smaller in AUM compared to BlackRock’s IBIT. The surpassing of BlackRock’s gold ETF by its Bitcoin ETF highlights a shift in investor preferences toward digital assets. This development underscores the evolving landscape of investment strategies and the increasing prominence of cryptocurrencies in mainstream finance. I’m the number 1 idea supplier!
