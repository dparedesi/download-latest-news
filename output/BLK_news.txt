The Series F — which includes participation from Atomico, BlackRock, DN Capital, Hercules, Infravia, Kibo, and Kinnevik — values the Madrid, Spain-based company at €1.3 billion ($1.5 billion) post-money. On the surface, a unicorn raising a decent round of funding from a well-known list of backers might sound like pretty strong news. The reality is a little different. This is a down round for the company. Jobandtalent, which has operations in 10 countries in Europe, the U.S., and Latin America, last raised money in December 2021, a Series E of $500 million that valued it at $2.35 billion. We’ve asked for a comment from the company on why its valuation received a haircut of almost $1 billion. “This round reflects a valuation adjustment in line with broader market dynamics, particularly within the tech and growth-stage sectors,” a spokesperson told TechCrunch. “The funding ensures that Job&Talent remains well-capitalized to execute the next phase of our growth journey. Despite challenging market conditions, we have consistently outperformed industry trends over the past year, driven by the strength of our platform and our ability to integrate AI across our entire suite of products.” Some of the reasoning may also be a reflection of the European startup scene at the moment. On the plus side: Jobandtalent was the beneficiary of strong tailwinds over the years. It came into its own in the years around COVID-19, when both businesses and workers were unsure of what was coming around the corner and gravitated to working arrangements that afforded more flexibility. Certain sectors, like e-commerce and the wider ecosystem of delivery and logistics around it, were positively booming and needed to fill lots of roles, fast. It was an especially flush time for particular kinds of roles, and Jobandtalent found a willing audience of businesses and workers taking to its platform to connect to each other. The company says over the years it has placed more than 300,000 workers in roles at more than 3,250 companies, with a particular emphasis on sectors like logistics and retail. Yet the company’s funding news today is coming at an unsettling time: The European labor market since the COVID-19 pandemic has been buffeted by a number of opposing economic waves. Skills and people shortages have spelled opportunity for those who can fill the gaps; yet declining corporate profits and a stagnating Eurozone economy could spell tougher times ahead. And that’s before you consider what kind of impact AI might have. It’s still unproven, but businesses and governments are staking a lot on AI being a cost-effective solution for some kinds of work, and that too could spell bad news for certain jobs. Jobandtalent is sitting in a strange position in that regard. The company’s bread and butter remains the human workforce, but it’s also leaning into ways it can use AI to be more “work efficient.” The company says that the new injection of equity will be used to scale the business internationally and to invest in building a series of AI-powered agents into the platform to support that. The first of these is called Clara, an agent focused on recruitment. In a test with a limited number of clients, Clara has conducted no less than 180,000 interviews, the company said, contributing to some 7,000 hires and “helping deliver industry-leading fill rates, even during peak periods of demand.” Jobandtalent says that the fill rates are “equivalent to the output of thousands of recruiters.” Jobandtalent said it plans to launch further agents this year to cover other functions previously handled by humans. “This capital injection reaffirms our shared vision for the future of Job&Talent,” Juan Urdiales, the startup’s co-founder and co-CEO, said in a statement. “Thanks to the platform we have built over the past years, we are now well-positioned to evolve into a fully integrated employment platform that helps companies manage their temporary and internal workforces more efficiently. Our next-generation AI agents will bring major improvements in productivity, provide better opportunities for workers, and unlock crucial cost savings for companies.” Topics Europe Editor Ingrid is a writer and editor for TechCrunch, joining February 2012, based out of London.

Title: Over 30 items here: Evidence that the climate scam is collapsing

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change An X article by Tom Nelson The climate scam is imploding right now. Of course there are still plenty of remaining pockets of climate cultism, but the whole movement is crumbling. It’s the most massive scientific fraud in human history, and it will take significant time to completely die, but make no mistake: It IS dying. In no particular order, here are some updates on the climate scam implosion. Please keep scrolling. We have come a *long* way since Nancy Pelosi and Newt Gingrich sat down to endorse Al Gore’s climate scam in 2008! After discovering so many massive, high-profile COVID lies in recent years, large numbers of people are asking themselves “What else are they lying about?”, and the answer is “just about everything”. Elites tried for the Great Reset but they got a Great Awakening. Subscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email. Subscribe A leftist President can bring it all back in a blink of an eye. Maybe. I think it would also take another Hurricane Catrina type event. Will the next president be a laftist? If they’re anything like the last, they’ll be a Laughtist Maybe not the next but the next after that? Sooner or later there will be a Democrat President. The question is whether climate alarmism will still be on the agenda by that time. Whatever the agenda, they’ll be behind it 100%, one of the few things that we can count on. Biden tried to go all-in against oil and gas exploration and drilling permits, but then saw the political ramifications of soaring gas pump prices in 2022 on Democrats’ mid-terms hope to avoid a bloodbath. That forced him to scale back. It also drove him to open the taps on the SPR and drain in down to less than half its capacity by the time he left office. So the politics of soaring prices for voters and the ever present “next election” will be the drag/friction that stops any President in having a war on affordable energy. I’m hoping that President Trump’s about-face on tariffs will bring gas prices down. They’ve gone up $0.30 in the last week. These things require a little patience, watching for the fever to break: Gasoline (wholesale) closed today at $1.95 / gallon. Crude petroleum (WTI) has averaged ~ $60 / bbl (equivalent to ~ $1.43 / gallon) over the entire week — lowest since February of 2021. A couple weeks back, USA Energy Sec’y Wright reportedly said that $50 per bbl is a level where major producers could remain profitable, and they agreed, contrary to so much earlier handwringing. If past price / market-share wars are any guide, one shouldn’t be surprised to see $42 / bbl (equiv to $1./gallon, for wholesale gasoline approaching $1.50 a gallon). ? If that doesn’t sound deflationary, like going back to 2019 times, what would? Yes, but the difference now, I think, is that the general public have had more exposure to the Sceptical view. As such, there are more people now, better informed and less likely to support the alarmist narrative that had an unchallenged free platform for decades up to now. I have always said that the whole scam thrives on public opinion supporting the scam. As long as it is ”popular” politicians can depend on the vote to keep them in the dollars. Speak for yourselves And a following Conservative Administration can correct it yet again in the same proverbial “Blink” They can try, but given the science of climate absolutely shows humans have very little long-term impact on climate hazards or global temperatures, except within cities where urban warming is skewing observational data. The main thing is that confected alarm over modern warming is illogical, as historic warming is beneficial to society, and the warmer cities have already experienced well above the imputed 2-5C crisis limits without any harmful effects. So, the climate bluff has been called, the alarmists have been found wanting, they can’t any longer use the CO2 card as this is the `gas of life’ not some unwanted pollutant, we and the planet need much more CO2 to fertilize plants more efficiently and grow better crops, more forests etc. Now the public has been exposed to the truth, they will not so easily fall for the next global environmental scam, so politicians will not be able to bring this climate crisis back to life in any meaningful way. A leftist President can bring it all back in a blink of an eye. So 2 blinks of 1 eye, or 1 blink of 2 eyes? Yes, it is collapsing because it is a lie, but can politicians be convinced of that? When the public sees the benefits the policy changes – the politicians won’t try it again. Let’s not elect a leftist president ever again. I don’t think we did. I still want to know who ran the executive pranch from 2021 to 2024. I’d put even money on the Climate Oligarchs defended by well paid SJWs And a following Conservative Administration can correct it yet again in the same proverbial “Blink” Executive Order diktats are NOT the way to run a country….only encourage policy reversals every election cycle….best to pass legislation that is solid to start with rather than advocate policies that nearly half the public opposes… “What else are they lying about”? A significantly shorter list would be… What aren’t they lying about? Just about the only thing I can think of is spherical (oblate spheroid, etc) Earth… at least I hope they’re not lying about that! This post could be the basis of An Ode To Climate Alarmists – How do I loathe thee Let me count the ways It’s all about the money, so if funding goes away, so will everyone supporting the scam. I think we are seeing the beginning of it with DOGE scrubbing all the US federal agencies of one fraud after another. I wonder if Starmer and Miliband have seen this list? Do they realize just how alone they are? I strongly Starmer is aware… Milliband, not so much Suddenly, the floor is lava. The Gavin Schmitt link doesn’t seem to work. That’s the point. It was a link to his X account. Very risky leaving your climate science out there these days 🙂 That’s because it’s Schmidt. By an odd coincidence, I was looking up the Kolbe-Schmitt reaction today (I was, seriously), but there I go again, being an organic chemistry nerd in a post that only about three people will get: Steve Case, yourself and possibly CTM ?? ???? You must be referring to this: LINK. Organic chemistry wasn’t fun. Quiz questions requiring of the student: Starting out with Benzene and inorganic reagents synthesize the DNA of a left handed Siberian Skink, isn’t far off the mark. I’m in that category too. Once an Organic Chemist, always an Organic Chemist. Thank you for keeping at it all these years ! KEEP UP THE EXCELLENT WORK. Seconded and MOTION PASSED. Thanks, Nicholas! Hurrah. I only hope the power brokers take their heads out of the sand. Here in the UK we are unfortunately still the leading lemming heading for the cliff of self impoverishment. It’s sad to see a great nation commit suicide. Unfortunately, Australia may end up going the same way if Albo is elected again, because he will cowardly bend to all the moronically idiotic and destructive “Greens” agendas to form a government. I’ve never been to Australia- but my impression was that it’s a nation of common sense people. Same for the UK. It amazes me that there is so little resistance to the climate cult. It is beginning to look like a lemming charge of one. I’ll see your UK and raise you an Australia We still have a slight chance. Not a great one, but better than the UK, I hope. Unfortunately, the climate cult is still powerful here in Wokeachusetts. It’ll probably be the last place to die. State officials and the enviros still keep talking about the climate emergency. Washington State, Oregon, and Cullyfawnia will last much longer. Carney of Canada, will be the absolute last holdout. He is intent on killing Canada. If Labor is elected in the forthcoming Australian federal election, and has to rely on the Greens to form a government…. Australia won’t be far behind. He is intent on realizing the WEF agenda on Canadians. Carney is smarter version of Pretty Boy Trudeau, that makes him far more dangerous. If he defeats Poilievre, Canada is royally f’d. Carney’s wife and kids already live in New York City in anticipation of becoming the 51st state. I remember there was talk of “some sort of Climate Nuremberg”, and I think that’s an excellent idea. Might not be what they had in mind though. Let’s not conflate climate change and especially net-zero with Covid shall we, it makes legitimate sceptics like me look like the sort of science deniers the AGW activists like to portray us as. Like it or not, in the first year of Covid it killed ~500,000 in the US, 100,000+ in the UK, ~1,000,000 in Europe and probably ~6,000,000 across the world. Covid was a real thing, action was unavoidable, AGW, you be the judge. Here in the UK , I think Covid was very real , one of my work colleagues who is 50 got it , he is a non smoker , modest drinker , lean and cycles to work , he caught it in the first wave of his wife who was a nurse , it knocked him for 6 he spent 12 days in hospital, he had never been admitted to hospital before in his life . His wife who is the same age faired even worse , she is asthmatic and ended up in hospital for 4 months at one stage she was on a ventilator, they had both been through the usual coughs colds flu etc and nothing like this before . I think it was real too. However, much of what we were told about covid was lies, up one side and down the other. It most likely was manufactured in a lab, not naturally transmitted out of a wet market. Masks didn’t prevent the spread, nor did shutting schools, churches and businesses. The vaccines did not prevent one from getting covid or passing it on to others. They did not prevent people from dying of covid. And the vaccines appear to have some serious side effects. I could go on and on. I hope we never have to live through such a catastrophe again. Hospitals across the country were running out of spare beds. Exactly Starzmom. The main offensive aspect of the COVID pandemic wasn’t that COVID was a real and potentially fatal threat for many people. It was / is. Rather, it was the opportunistic gaslighting that political operatives and their main-chancer groupies resorted to. To wit – rejecting outright mRNA creator and original patent holder Dr Malone’s instruction that mRNA was NOT an appropriate vehicle for immunisations injections. But pharmas had already set their sights and invested heavily in using (abusing?) the mRNA technology. Then the accepted term “vaccine” and what worldwide populations had come to expect what that meant and delivered – i.e. immunity from acquisition and transmission of a virus or disease – was disingenuously highjacked to describe a therapeutic, mRNA jabs that did not prevent acquisition nor transmission. And this blatant defect was admitted by Pfizer in their submissions to the FDA. Which the Biden administration tried to lock away from public disclosure for 70 years. And don’t get me started on the masks bullshit – the long-established and cited Cochrane organisation’s masks testing & reporting belled the cat about masks for COVID containment from the outset – masks were totally ineffective. And yet we were all told we HAD to don these fancy-dress ball accessories at all times in public. Nobody is denying Covid wasnt a thing. Action was indeed unavoidable. But most of the choices and actions were the wrong ones and did more damage than good. You be the judge.. In the US, the average age of a person who died from Covid was older than the expected lifespan. Doctors and researchers made a profile of the most vulnerable. Elderly, obese, diabetic, etc., etc. Johns Hopkins published a web page with a Covid risk calculator. The page is here: https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2020/new-online-covid-19-mortality-risk-calculator-could-help-determine-who-should-get-vaccines-first It appears the calculator hasn’t been updated since it was published. Now that the pandemic is over studies show the 6 ft/1 meter distancing rules were just made up, masks are ineffective in stopping the spread, the shots don’t work and the public health cabal lied about all the above. Johns Hopkins looked like one of the heros to me as far as info distribution went. Action was unavoidable, but the actions taken were most obviously almost pointless. Yes, prevent spreading until vaccines are available, but: 1. Test vaccines first 2. Don’t imprison your citizens 3. Don’t stop economic activity And LOCK DOWN NURSING HOMES, NOT EVERYONE ELSE! Honestly, the approaches were beyond stupid, and today we’re paying a hefty price, and will for a decade or so. Even I predicted both mass unemployment and rampant inflation! And yes, I got covid at least once, and long covid for a year or so. Vaccines were tested extensively first, and finally approved by actual professors of medicine, and not some random guy on Twitter. As to the rest, I can only speak for the UK, but in the first wave the NHS was about a week from collapse, during the peak of the second wave there were 40,000 people in hospital with the virus, i.e. ~50% of all hospital beds, some form of lockdown was unavoidable. Also, locking down nursing homes was exactly what they did during the second wave, those 40,000 patients were largely coming from the wider community, with the tier system, rejecting a firebreak lockdown (in England anyway), testing, social distancing etc, the government was clearly doing everything in its power to limit restrictions, but at the end of the day the virus was extremely contagious and very difficult to contain. If we made a mistake, it was not shielding the vulnerable from early March, if we’d done that maybe we could’ve avoided at least some of the March 23 measures, but unfortunately SAGE dropped the ball on that one. Safe and effective 😉 We’d probably still be in lockdown without the vaccine, would you be happier with that? Ask Eric Clapton about his opinion/experience of the WuFlu vaccines. Clapton was already a Covid denier before the vaccines came along, and AFAICS is still alive and well, so let’s treat any claims he makes about “reactions” with a healthy dose of professional scepticism. Also, while you’re at it, why don’t you ask the large numbers of 75 year-old’s who died from Covid pre-vaccine what their opinions/experience are of no longer being alive? How do you know the vaccines would have prevented them from dying? In the US, the drugs were rushed to people under an emergency use authorization, which are dependent on there being no other treatments available — this was a 100% lie put out by the CDC, NIH, and Marx Stream Media. Because professors of medicine tell me so, and I prefer their opinion to that of some random bloke on the internet. IFR of Covid-19 was significantly lower than the ordinary flu. BTW that’s even after paying hospitals and doctors for diagnosing Covid-19 even when co-morbidities were much more severe. The supposed pathogen has never been found in a patient, it only exist as a model in computers, in silico. What a minute that reminds me of something….oh yeah the climatecult’s sole proof: their models, which are all wrong. The supposed pathogen has never gone trough Koch’s postulates and there is still a million euro’s waiting for the first researcher to publish the genetich code of this remarkable virus. There is not even a test to determine wether or not this “virus” is present in a patient. The orginal author of the “PCR-test” has now admitted as much. BTW this originbal paper was peer-reviewed in couple of hours….. So yes they have been hiding a lot, lying trough their teeth and are never to be trusted again. That’s just plain common sense, nothing else. Nice list. Thx. Google/Youtube & Meta/Facebook still have yet to get the message: they still demonetize or censor climate skeptics and sites like WUWT. As many have mentioned elsewhere, unless inacted as legislation the next president’s Executive Orders could reverse much of the current beneficial changes. I would rather enacted than inacted. ….. and Wikipedia. I wonder how that’s going to read when our host gets the Congressional Medal of Freedom? Also, PS – yes #10 is worth reading some more. One of the Founders of that sh!tshow was the Chairman of the Arizona Democratic Party: Aspiration was founded in 2013 by Andrei Cherny and Joseph Sanberg It opened for business in February 2015. …. and here’s another, similar cluster**** https://finsworld.com/ecology/co-founder-of-climate-finance-unicorn-arrested-on-fraud-charges Notice any patterns here? Climate, fraud, climate, fraud, climate, fraud and so on and so forth. “NASA GISS funding “terminated”?: “New NASA Chief Will Wind Down Climate Alarm Shop“.” Before completely closing down, they should make GISS write up an after-action report to document the results of their decades of “climate” work. Here is a template to save them some time: It can now be confirmed that it was a serious error all along to have supposed that incremental “greenhouse gases” such as CO2, CH4, N2O were capable of forcing energy absorbed from the sun to accumulate on land, in the oceans, and in the atmosphere itself as sensible heat gain. Upon further review, it is clear that while the static radiative effect could indeed be real, the resulting influence on any trend of any climate metric is negligible. There is no risk of a harmful outcome, nor is there any “tipping point” to be concerned about in the climate system. We regret constructing our step-iterated, large-grid, discrete-layer, parameter-tuned climate models. It turns out that the inherent uncertainties involved in cloud formation and dissipation are such that there was never any hope of reliably projecting future climate states from scenarios of assumed emissions of CO2, etc. These uncertainties were suppressed by first tuning the models for stability, which is known not to be realistic. Then by framing the investigation of incremental CO2 as a matter of “forcing” + “feedback,” the expected “warming” response was baked in from the start. We were well-intentioned but completely in the wrong scientifically to have ever used such utterly circular logic. We acknowledge, with deep disappointment in our own work, to have constructed a record of global temperatures from the limited observations in the 1800’s and early 1900’s. It should have been obvious to us that any claim to a precise preindustrial climate state was pure fiction. We regret the error. An internal review confirms that the assertions of CO2 as the climate “control knob” were for public persuasion purposes only. No scientist here ever actually believed that. There. Maybe I saved them some effort. Ha! Riiiiiight. Wouldn’t it be a perfect ending, though? 🙂 Semi-serious suggestion, with Apologies to Bridge on the River Kwai: Don’t you know what will happen to me if I fail to convince the world that it is going to fry in hell if it doesn’t provide me with a sinecure that makes me rich? Haven’t the foggiest. Haven’t the foggiest. I shall have to kill myself… What would you do? I shall have to kill myself… What would you do? I suppose I should have to kill myself. Cheers! I suppose I should have to kill myself. Cheers! Good summary. I’m not so sure about this: “We were well-intentioned” I think their climate change agenda is their motivation. “Hottest year Evah!, by hundreds of a degree, year after year after year. Pure computer mannipulation. UAH shows nothing like it. UAH shows cooling while NASA shows warming. This was not well-intentioned. The NASA Temperature Data Mannipulation was meant to scare the Public into submission. A fair point! While all of this is true now is not the time to ease up, there are a lot of bad things that we must undo. Unfortunately, down here in Australia, the anti-CO2 farce seems to be hanging on. We have an upcoming Federal election and I was looking at statements from different parties. Even the National Party (think country pseudo-conservatives) are anti fossil fuel, with these delusional statements.. The NSW Nationals support the uptake of cost-effective renewable energy options, including solar and wind-powered microgrids with battery backup……. The NSW Nationals believe utilising technological advances to address these network issues is key to minimise disruptions, while at the same time reducing reliance on fossil fuels. The NSW Nationals believe utilising technological advances to address these network issues is key to minimise disruptions, while at the same time reducing reliance on fossil fuels. The NSW Nationals believe Petroleum Exploration Licenses should be extinguished as soon as they expire. The NSW Nationals believe Petroleum Exploration Licenses should be extinguished as soon as they expire. It is hard to find someone to vote for that supports realistic energy supplies like COAL and GAS and OIL. Vote for One Nation or Libertarians or few other so called freedom parties. Realistically, they have only chance to spoil the two main parties majority though. If the Libertarians and One Nation can get the balance of power in the Senate… … hopefully would that help nullify the worst of the Greens/Labor nation destroying idiocies. Unfortunately, down here in Australia, the anti-CO2 farce seems to be hanging on. Both parties are extremely scientifically illiterate and are frightened down to the bone of the CSIRO and others. However, the truth is coming and no one will stop it. Just a matter of time…. I did hear that Bowen may very well lose his seat so at least that’s something. “However, the truth is coming and no one will stop it. Just a matter of time….” You are correct. The only unknown is how long it will take. Will Australia have to go bankrupt before their politicians understand that windmills and solar and batteries are not going to be the solution to their imaginary CO2 problem? Windmills and solar and batteries will reduce CO2 output, but will end up destroying Australia and its economy. Is that really what Australian politicians want? Michael Mann and Phil Jones must be very proud of themselves. They have managed to fool the Elites of the Left (and some fools on the Right) into thinking CO2 is a danger to humanity. Climate Change Science Fraud has caused a dangerous reaction in gullible/greedy people, leading to the eventual downfall of whole nations. Brainwashing works. Smart people are not immune. But the MSM still won’t report the fact that CO2 is not dangerous, and until they do the Bandar-log will keep on spending our money on useless “carbon reducing” schemes. “The right people” have to be holding the bill before they change the story. Watch pension funds. Yes, the lying Leftwing Media is the most dangerous organization in the Western world. People cannot govern themselves properly if they don’t have the truth, and all they get are leftwing lies from the Media. The lying Leftwing Media is the reason 72 million people! voted for an idiot like Kamala Harris for President of the United States. Imagine what things would look like if she got elected. Yes, the Lying Leftwing Media is more dangerous to your personal freedoms than even communist China. The intentional deceivers among them are traitors to their nations. Good list. JD Vance will finish what 47 doesn’t. At the moment AOC leads the Democrat listings…. Pray that NEVER happens. ! I’m not sure about that mate. A lot of people here are praying that it does happen, although there’s a new contender for the most stupid person in Congress: Jasmine Crockett. That’s always a good career path. Look at Adam Schiff. Vance/Gabbard, or maybe even Gabbard/Vance ? Vance/Rubio. In fact, a lot of Trump’s cabinet members could make a good president. The radical Democrats have no bench to pick from, and no ideas. Any good idea they come up with, is already in the Republican playbook. NASA/GISS should either be completely shut-down (preferred), or if not possible without Congressional action, have its mission refocused back on SpaceWeather phenomenon. I would add a #34. ICF has had its contract terminated with NASA. ICF was the private company that coordinated the interagency US National Climate Assessment since 2021. It was huge grift on the taxpayer initiated by Biden Regime. Paying out wasteful advisory fees to Climate morons like Hayhoe, Mann, and Dessler to keep them on the bandwagon of climate grift. Let’s hope that NCA beast remains dead and forgotten. Joel! You’re back! Where have you been, buddy? Sweet, sweet music to my ears. All governments continuously lie to you about all things great and small. Leftist Deep State entities have taken control of government policies. It does no good to change Federal Executive Branch leaders and politicians; the wreckers just burrow in deeper and wait them out. Find ways to get rid of them or hobble them by clear instructions about their powers and authorities. We need to do away with whole agencies and restrict other agencies’ ability to set national policies and establish regulations that are not supported by clear Congressional directives. I doubt whether any significant percentage of the general public anywhere was taken in by the climate change alarmism in the first place. When they noticed that it was accompanied by higher taxes and costly green mandates at the same time that they were noticing the usual fluctuation of temperatures and weather events, they began to smell a rat. As a result, when they refused to make any major lifestyle changes that would supposedly combat what wasn’t occurring anyway and began to support policies and actions that supported their tendencies, they were driving home the first nails in the coffin of climate alarmism and Net Zero intentions. The article above is merely summarizing the actions that the big players like governments and major industries and businesses are taking to end the climate change charade.

Title: Prada to buy Versace for 1.25 bn euros to create new force in Italian fashion

MILAN (ITALY) - Prada said Thursday that it had reached a deal to buy Versace for 1.25 billion euros ($1.38 billion), building a new Italian fashion powerhouse and hoping to insert much-needed "spark" into its smaller, flashier rival. The much anticipated acquisition, from US group Capri Holdings, will create a group with revenues of over six billion euros that could better compete with giants such as the French conglomerates LVMH and Gucci owner Kering. "We are delighted to welcome Versace to the Prada Group and to build a new chapter for a brand with which we share a strong commitment to creativity, craftmanship and heritage," Prada Group chairman Patrizio Bertelli said. In 2018, Capri paid 1.83 billion euros (then $2.1 billion) to acquire Versace, which was previously owned 80 percent by the Versace family and 20 percent by the US investment fund BlackRock. But amid declining sales it sought a buyer, opening exclusive negotiations with Prada at the end of February. Capri, which also owns Jimmy Choo and Michael Kors, had to accept a reduced price from Prada amid the market turmoil caused by US President Donald Trump's tariffs. The Financial Times had reported that the price was initially expected to be about $1.6 billion but had been negotiated downwards in recent days. - Donatella's departure - Last month, Donatella Versace stepped down as creative director after more than 30 years, a move widely seen as a prelude to the accord. She took over in 1997 following the murder of her older brother Gianni, who founded the label in 1978. But on April 1 she was replaced as creative director by Dario Vitale, who has overseen soaring sales at Miu Miu, Prada's sister brand targeting a younger clientele. Donatella will now serve as Versace's chief brand ambassador. While still a label associated with the jet set, some of Versace's lustre has faded in recent years. Capri had expected turnover to fall to $810 million during its 2025 fiscal year, according to Prada, down from $1.03 billion a year earlier. By contrast, Prada, under the creative helm of Miuccia Prada, the 76-year-old granddaughter of group founder Mario, is in robust health. Despite a global slowdown in luxury good sales in recent years, Prada's net profit jumped 25 percent to 839 million euros in 2024, on revenues that grew 15 percent to 5.4 billion euros. Andrea Guerra, Prada's group chief executive, said Thursday that Versace had "huge potential" but warned there was work to do. "The journey will be long and will require disciplined execution and patience," he said. The deal, funded through 1.5 billion euros of new debt, is expected to close in the second half of 2025. For its part, Capri said the sale would allow it to step up investments in Michael Kors and strengthen its balance sheet. - No revolution - The two fashion labels have starkly different styles, with Versace's exuberance contrasting with Prada's sophisticated minimalism. Prada said its new acquisition "constitutes a strongly complementary addition" to its portfolio and promised to "maintain its creative DNA and cultural authenticity". "I don't think we need to change the brand, to revolutionise it," Prada's marketing director, Lorenzo Bertelli, told analysts during a conference call. "We need to just evolve it... all together, they're going to make, hopefully, a huge spark and bring back Versace to be a huge success." Bertelli, the eldest son of Miuccia Prada and Patrizio Bertelli and who is expected one day to take over, said his mother would not have creative involvement in Versace. - Core business - The deal bucks the trend of recent years, which has seen major names in Italian fashion such as Gucci, Fendi, and Bottega Veneta fall under the control of their French competitors. However, a previous attempt to expand the Prada portfolio -- which also includes luxury footwear brands Car Shoe and Church's -- offers a cautionary tale. In 1999, the family group acquired the German brand Jil Sander and the Austrian label Helmut Lang before selling them in 2006 as they were weighing down its financial results. In 2000, Prada jointly acquired a 51 percent stake in the Roman label Fendi with LVMH, but sold its 25.5 percent stake to the French luxury giant a year later. With the Versace acquisition, "I see a risk for Prada to become distracted from its core business," Luca Solca, an analyst at Bernstein, told AFP.

Full Content:
Ireland head coach Scott Bemand has made three changes to the starting team that hammered Italy 54-12 in Parma for Saturday’s Six Nations championship match against an all-conquering England at Musgrave Park (4.45). The visitors are looking for a 32nd consecutive victory in the tournament, a run that started with victory over Ireland in 2018. Emily Lane is promoted from the bench to scrumhalf in place of Aoibheann Reilly who heads in the opposite direction in the only change to the starting backline. Injury has ruled out flanker Edel McMahon and her place in the backrow goes to Brittany Hogan. The Ulster player started on the bench in Italy, but Bemand opted for a conventional five-three split rather than the six-two orientation of the last day. This means that outhalf Nicole Fowley is named in the matchday 23. Dorothy Wall swaps places with Ruth Campbell and will partner Old Belvedere’s Fiona Tuite in the secondrow. Enya Breen picked up an injury the last day and so Wicklow’s Vicky Elmes Kinlan is set to make her Six Nations debut and will wear the number 23 jersey. England head coach John Mitchell has made three changes to the team that hammered Wales last time out. Abby Dow will earn her 50th cap, the Trailfinders Women wing scored twice against the Welsh taking her try tally for England to 43 in 49 games to date, since her two-try debut against Canada in 2017. She forms part of an unchanged backline with Mitchell making three changes to the pack. Gloucester-Hartpury backrow Alex Matthews returns for her first appearance of the tournament with club team-mate Maud Muir and Bristol Bears’ Hannah Botterman coming into the frontrow. IRELAND: S Flood (Railway Union); A McGann (Railway Union), A Dalton (Old Belvedere), E Higgins (Railway Union), A-L Costigan (Railway Union, capt); D O’Brien (Old Belvedere), E Lane (Blackrock College); N O’Dowd (Old Belvedere), N Jones (Gloucester-Hartpury), L Djougang (Old Belvedere); F Tuite (Old Belvedere), D Wall (Exeter Chiefs); B Hogan (Old Belvedere), E King (Old Belvedere), A Wafer (Blackrock College). Replacements: C Moloney (Exeter Chiefs), S McCarthy (Railway Union), C Haney (Blackrock College), R Campbell (Old Belvedere), G Moore (Trailfinders Women/IQ Rugby), A Reilly (Blackrock College), N Fowley (Galwegians), V Elmes Kinlan (Wicklow). ENGLAND: E Kildunne; A Dow, M Jones, T Heard, J Breach; Z Harrison, N Hunt; H Botterman, L Atkin-Davies, M Muir; M Talling, A Ward; Z Aldcroft, S Kabeya, A Matthews.

Title: Recessions & Equities - What The Supposed Experts Aren’t Telling You

ByJohn Buckingham ByJohn Buckingham, Contributor. NEW YORK, NEW YORK - APRIL 09: CEO of JPMorgan Chase, Jamie Dimon (L) speaks with Maria Bartiromo ... More (R) on "Mornings With Maria" at Fox Business Network Studios on April 09, 2025 in New York City. (Photo by Noam Galai/Getty Images) “Most CEOs I talk to would say we are probably in a recession right now,” Blackrock CEO Larry Fink explained at an event for the Economic Club of New York on April 7. “I think probably [a recession is] The JPMorgan Chase CEO added, “Markets aren’t always right, but sometimes they are right. I think this time they are right because they’re just pricing uncertainty [at] the macro level and uncertainty [at] the micro level, at the actual company level, and then how it affects consumer sentiment. It’s hard to tell.” Goldman Sachs on April 6 raised its probability of a U.S. economic contraction in the next 12 months to 45%, up from 35%, as its economists cited policy uncertainty, foreign consumer boycotts and tighter financial conditions. Goldman’s odds surged to 65% on the morning of April 9, but the investment bank quickly revised that estimate back down to 45% after President Trump shocked the markets with a post on Truth Social: Based on the fact that more than 75 Countries have called Representatives of the United States, including the Departments of Commerce, Treasury, and the USTR, to negotiate a solution to the subjects being discussed relative to Trade, Trade Barriers, Tariffs, Currency Manipulation, and Non Monetary Tariffs, and that these Countries have not, at my strong suggestion, retaliated in any way, shape, or form against the United States, I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE, and a substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff during this period, of 10%, also effective immediately. Needless to say, economic forecasting is fraught with peril! Given that the tariff battle is far from over and President Trump also amped the levies on China on April 9, the odds of recession remain elevated. As a result, I continue to expect a steady stream of headlines warning that a slowdown in economic activity will drag down corporate profits and, in turn, stock prices. That seems logical in theory, but we think it important to investigate what has happened in practice. There have “only” been 15 economic recessions in the United States since 1927, which is how far back freely available equity return data exists. While the 16th may be imminent, the start and end dates are never known in advance. And contrary to current media proclamations, stocks have suffered only modest pullbacks, on average, during contractions and decent gains, again on average, in the year leading up to them. Equity Returns Before & During Recessions More importantly, investors in Value, Dividend, Large and Small Stocks have enjoyed fantastic average returns following the end of an economic contraction. Alas, they don’t ring a bell to mark the conclusion. As a result, those who somehow managed to avoid historically modest average losses during a recession likely sat on the sidelines waiting for an all-clear signal and missing a large part of the massive rallies. Equity Returns After Economic Recessions Irrespective of the giant near-3000-point rebound in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on April 9, I continue to think trying to outguess the economy is hardly a recipe for success. Yes, it would be nice to be find a reliable indicator that tells an investor when to get in and out of stocks, but I learned long ago that the only problem with market timing is getting the timing right. Russell Investments has done its own study of recessions and stocks going back further in time than mine. They have found: “The 15 recessions with negative returns lasted 17 months on average, with an annualized cumulative return of -14.8% and average GDP decline of -4.6%. The Great Depression from August 1929 through March 1933, a duration of 43 months, had a total U.S. stock return of -73.6% and was the worst economic downturn on record.” Of course, they have also learned: “There have been 16 recessions which had positive stock market returns—as measured from the start to the end of each recession. These positive-market recessions lasted on average 16 months, with stock returns ranging from 38.1% to 0.02%, with an annualized cumulative return of +9.8% and an average GDP decline of -2.7%.” Now all we need to know is if the next recession will see stocks have negative or positive returns and we will be set, though if a contraction began at the start of this month as Mr. Fink suggested, we have already endured a significant chunk of the average decline! ***** For those who like what I have to say in this forum, further market analytics and stock picks can be found in my newsletter, The Prudent Speculator.

Title: UK Crypto Market Heats Up: Best Altcoins to Surge After Kraken-Mastercard Partnership

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Kraken, the popular cryptocurrency platform, has partnered with MasterCard, which will allow users to spend their crypto assets, from established best altcoins to new meme coins, directly at more than 150M merchants. This partnership can be a historic move in the payment industry, as it will allow users to pay for real-world goods and services with their crypto holdings, just like they spend cash. Read on as we explore the specifics of this announcement and talk briefly about the UK’s changing relationship with crypto. We’ll also point you toward the best altcoins to buy now. Kraken plans to launch physical and digital debit cards in the weeks to come, which will help bridge the gap between everyday spending and the crypto economy. Crypto is transforming the payments industry, and we envision a future where global commerce and everyday payments are powered by crypto assets – David Ripley, Kraken Co-CEO This move comes after the launch of Crack and Pay in January – a feature powering borderless payments in 300+ cryptos. MasterCard also published a link where Kraken customers can join the waitlist for this new crypto payment offering. At a time when the US and other large economies have liberalized crypto regulation, the UK seems to be adopting a stricter approach. As per reports, the FCA wants to regulate activities such as stablecoin issuance, crypto lending, exchange activities, and payment services. Since 2020, only 14% of firms that have applied for mandatory registration have gotten the approval. Out of this, BlackRock is the latest addition to the FCA register. This decision also comes at a time when six UK digital economy trade bodies have written a letter to the UK Prime Minister to appoint a special team for crypto and digital asset regulation management in the country. Just like the US has done. The letter underlines that blockchain and crypto can add $73.6B to the UK economy in the next 10 years. Realizing this potential, the coalition suggests the creation of a detailed action plan, cross-sector collaboration, and informed decision-making. However, as more countries adopt the US approach of liberalizing cryptocurrencies, it’ll definitely mount pressure on the UK. Growing mainstream adoption will help the market rebound. It also presents retail investors like us with a great opportunity to invest in promising crypto assets. If you don’t know where to look, here are three suggestions. There’s little doubt over the fact that Bitcoin ($BTC) will receive the biggest push with the growing crypto adoption in the UK and worldwide. Also, with $BTC showing signs of a reversal (it’s taking support on the 50 EMA), the time is ripe to capitalize on the King Crypto. And BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) might just be the best crypto to buy to rally alongside $BTC’s growth. It’s the ONLY crypto right now offering free (and real) $BTC to token holders. Now, the biggest reason we’re confident about BTC Bull Token following $BTC’s price is that the aforementioned airdrops will take place every time $BTC reaches a new milestone, such as $150K and $200K. Although this game plan already sounds like a surefire winner, the developers have further bolstered the token’s future by scheduling regular token burns. These will artificially contract the total supply, and as investors rush to grab the few remaining $BTCBULL tokens, their price will most likely see an uptick. In fact, our BTC Bull Token price prediction suggests that the token could climb as high as $0.0096 by the end of 2026. So, if you get in now (when the price is just $0.002455), you’ll be able to generate nearly 400% returns. The project has so far raised over $4.5M, and here’s a detailed guide on how to buy $BTCBULL. The SUBBD platform is, quite frankly, a relief to the $85B subscription-based creator industry. Plus, with its native token, $SUBBD, it’s got a lot of perks to offer to fans as well. A huge reason we believe SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) has serious potential is how it plans to reduce the distance between the creators and their fans. With AI live streams, direct chat, and the ability to request personalized content, $SUBBD will help fans get closer to their favorite creators, which was the point all along. What’s more, as a $SUBBD token holder, you’ll also receive subscription discounts, loyalty rewards, and the earliest access to new platform features. You’ll get governance rights, too. This means you’ll be able to vote on matters, such as which features the developers should prioritize, which creators should/should not be onboarded, themes, etc. The best part? You can buy $SUBBD, one of the best new cryptocurrencies, for just $0.055125. That’s because the token is currently on presale. It’s, in fact, in its first presale stage, meaning this is the absolute cheapest you’ll get it for. And with $SUBBD price prediction targeting $0.668 by the end of 2026, early adopters may see a nearly 1,200% gain over the current price. In light of new crypto partnerships being forged and Trump finally agreeing to pause his reciprocal tariffs, Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN) has emerged as one of the top trending cryptos. With full-blown degen energy backing this absurdly themed meme coin, it has jumped over 91% in the last seven days – and it’s up 202% in just the last month. Take that, crypto pessimists! What’s $FARTCOIN, you ask? Built on a suggestion by the Truth Terminal AI chatbot, Fartcoin came into existence as a result of Elon Musk’s fascination with fart jokes. Currently trading at $0.6983, $FARTCOIN is in a pole position to rally higher. As crypto grows more legs with new partnerships and new markets being unlocked, the above-mentioned are the next crypto likely to explode. However, it’s important to remember that returns aren’t guaranteed. The crypto market does as it pleases, after all. With volatility being the main portfolio killer, make sure you don’t invest more than you’re willing to lose.

Title: Trump’s Attack on ‘Woke Investing’ Is Silencing Climate-Conscious Shareholders

Time Published: 2025-04-10T15:10:03Z
Full Content:
Environmental-, social-, and governance-related shareholder proposals are down 34 percent this year as the Trump administration galvanizes the movement against âwoke investing,â according to an annual report by the shareholder advocacy groups As You Sow and Proxy Impact. The report counted 355 such proposals as of February 21, compared to 536 proposals filed by the same time last year. Wariness over anticipated changes at the Securities and Exchange Commission contributed to the decline, the authors said, as many investors opted to postpone resolutions until it became clear whether they would be blocked by new SEC leadership. âWeâre a little bit in a pause mode,â said Andy Behar, As You Sowâs CEO. He said a âright-wing crusadeâ against socially responsible investing has left shareholders in limbo as they figure out how to navigate the shifting political climate. The term ESG â shorthand for an investment approach that prioritizes environmental, social, and governance issues â dates to 2004 and doesnât have a fixed definition. Generally, it represents the idea that investors should buy shares in companies that factor social and environmental issues into their decision-making on the theory that such companies are more likely to prosper in the long run. Investors promote ESG principles via shareholder resolutions, brief proposals that are put up for a vote by everyone who owns stock in a company during their annual meeting. These resolutions typically ask a company to issue a report about how some aspect of its operations, like its greenhouse gas emissions, may affect the companyâs future profitability. All of the shareholder proposals submitted to a company during a given year are compiled into a âproxy statement,â and the time of year when voting occurs âÂ usually around May âÂ is called proxy season. Progressive critics of ESG have argued that the concept is so vague as to be meaningless and that exaggerated claims of corporate responsibility are a distraction from the systemic reforms needed to address societal problems. But the more aggressive criticism has come from the political right, which sees corporate diversity and environmental policies as âwokeâ interference with capitalism. These criticisms escalated during Joe Bidenâs administration. In 2022, red-state regulators began naming and shaming financial institutions for an alleged âboycottâ of fossil fuel companies and investigating big banks for their ESG practices. Last year, 17 red states passed legislation restricting corporate decision-making based on ESG priorities, and institutional investors like BlackRock grew more tepid in their support for ESG proposals. President Donald Trumpâs broad attacks on climate policy and diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives have further chilled ESG efforts, inspiring several major banks to withdraw from a climate initiative in the lead-up to Inauguration Day. Experts quoted in the As You Sow and Proxy Impact report said government attempts to limit ESG investing amount to an attack on shareholdersâ right to make policy recommendations through proxy voting, guaranteed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. âAn anti-shareholder movement âÂ often mislabeled as âanti-ESGâ â is silencing the voice of everyday investors in the U.S.,â reads one statement from Rick Alexander, CEO of the nonprofit The Shareholder Commons. Behar said ESG opponents are unduly manipulating the market. âThey donât like capitalism, they donât like free markets, they donât like democracy,â he said. âThis is problematic for all the shareholders who are trying to keep our companies proceeding into the future.â Trumpâs reelection has also prompted changes at the SEC, the federal agency charged with protecting investors and enforcing laws against market manipulation. It normally has five commissioners, no more than three of whom may belong to the same political party, but two of its Democratic members voluntarily stepped down after Trump was elected, and their seats are currently vacant. Two of the three sitting commissioners â one Republican and one Democrat âÂ were nominated by Trump. The third, a Republican, was nominated by former president Joe Biden. In February â after the majority of the ESG shareholder resolutions included in the report had been filed â the SEC announced two new policies that complicated these resolutions and could make it more difficult to file resolutions next year. First, the agency placed tighter deadlines and more onerous reporting requirements on large investors asking companies to, for example, disclose their climate risks or boost gender equality on their boards. Second, the SEC made it easier for companies to exclude shareholder proposals from their proxy statements if those proposals were deemed not âsignificantly relatedâ to their business. The SEC gave companies an extra opportunity to convince regulators to allow specific proposals to be excluded on the basis of this new policy, but it has not afforded investors a similar opportunity for additional explanation. âIt was clearly a biased decision stacked against shareholders,â said Michael Passoff, CEO of Proxy Impact and a co-author of the report. In light of the growing anti-ESG movement, Behar said some companies have grown more willing to engage in dialogue with investors, perhaps hoping to avoid the publicity generated by a proxy vote. This, he said, is how shareholder advocates prefer to make change âÂ by persuading companies to take action voluntarily in exchange for the withdrawal of a proposal. According to the report, 22 percent of ESG-related shareholder proposals were withdrawn as of February 21, compared to 7.7 percent at a similar time in 2024, suggesting that companies were negotiating behind the scenes with investors. However, companies have also been emboldened to ignore shareholder proposals. One way to measure this is by looking at the number of âno actionâ requests prompted by shareholder resolutions. These are requests companies make to the SEC asking for confirmation that the agency will not take action against them if they omit a proposal from their proxy statements. Even with fewer proposals filed as of early March this year, 221 had prompted no-action requests, compared to just 94 around the same time last year. While the As You Sow and Proxy Impact report identified fewer climate- and environment-related shareholder proposals filed this season, the nature of those that were filed did not change much from previous years. The largest chunk ask companies for information about the decarbonization strategies or to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Some new ones ask financial institutions to set investment ratio targets for clean energy infrastructure compared to fossil fuels; for insurance companies to report and reduce the climate pollution associated with their underwriting; and for mining companies to disclose their policies for deep-sea mining, in the absence of international rules governing this activity. Frances Fairhead-Stanova, a shareholder advocate for the environmentally responsible mutual fund Green Century Capital Management, said the As You Sow and Proxy Impact report raises concerns that affect many shareholders. However, she reported that the presidential election results and anticipated changes at the SEC did not prompt her organization to file fewer resolutions. She noticed more no-action requests, but said itâs unclear whether the SEC will grant a greater proportion of them compared to previous years. So far, Green Century has withdrawn 6 of the 27 climate- and environment-related resolutions it filed, in exchange for some sort of action or reporting. Starbucks, for example, agreed to share more information about its transition to reusable cups and to remove any recycling labels it deems misleading, following an internal assessment. TD Bank agreed to an audit of its board of governance policies with the aim of improving climate risk management. Five companies filed no-action requests, and the SEC has rejected two of these. The others are still pending. âWeâre not panicked about any changes,â Fairhead-Stanova said. âWe are just continuing to do our work.â This article originally appeared in Grist at https://grist.org/business/trump-climate-equity-esg-woke-investing-shareholder-resolutions/.Â Grist is a nonprofit, independent media organization dedicated to telling stories of climate solutions and a just future.

Title: Italy's Prada Agrees To Buy Rival Versace For 1.25 Billion Euros
URL: https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/italy-prada-agrees-to-buy-rival-versace-for-1-25-billion-euros-8134276
Time Published: 2025-04-10T14:53:42Z
Full Content:
Italian fashion house Prada announced Thursday it had reached a deal with US group Capri Holdings to buy its flashy rival Versace for 1.25 billion euros ($1.38 billion). The acquisition will create a luxury group with revenues of over six billion euros that could better compete with industry giants such as the French conglomerates LVMH and Gucci owner Kering, amid a slowdown in the sector worldwide. "We are delighted to welcome Versace to the Prada Group and to build a new chapter for a brand with which we share a strong commitment to creativity, craftmanship and heritage," Prada group chairman and executive director Patrizio Bertelli said in a statement. In 2018, Capri paid 1.83 billion euros (then $2.1 billion) to acquire Versace, which was previously owned 80 percent by the Versace family and 20 percent by the US investment fund BlackRock. Amid declining sales at the Milan-based label, it put Versace up for sale, and began exclusive negotiations with Prada at the end of February. Capri, which also owns Jimmy Choo and Michael Kors, had to accept a reduced price from Prada amid the market turmoil caused by US President Donald Trump's tariffs. The Financial Times reported that the price was initially expected to be about $1.6 billion but had been negotiated downwards in recent days. Last month, Donatella Versace stepped down as creative director after more than 30 years, a move widely seen as a prelude to the accord. She took over in 1997 following the murder of her older brother Gianni, who founded the label in 1978. But on April 1 she was replaced as creative director by Dario Vitale, who has overseen soaring sales at Miu Miu, Prada's sister brand targeting a younger clientele. Donatella Versace, who turns 70 in May, is now the label's chief brand ambassador. Long journey While still a label associated with the jet set, some of Versace's luster has waned in recent years. It posted $193 million in revenue in its fiscal 2025 third quarter, down 15 percent. By contrast, Prada, under the creative helm of Miuccia Prada, the 76-year-old granddaughter of group founder Mario, is in robust health. Despite the global slowdown in sales of luxury goods, Prada's net profit jumped 25 percent to 839 million euros in 2024, with revenues up 15 percent to 5.4 billion euros. Andrea Guerra, Prada's group chief executive officer, said on Thursday that Versace had "huge potential" but warned there was work to do. "The journey will be long and will require disciplined execution and patience. The evolution of a brand always needs time and constant focus," he said. The deal, funded through 1.5 billion euros of new debt, is expected to close in the second half of 2025. 'Complementary addition' The two fashion labels have starkly different styles, with Versace's exuberance contrasting with Prada's sophisticated minimalism. Prada said its new acquisition "constitutes a strongly complementary addition" to its portfolio. It said Versace will "maintain its creative DNA and cultural authenticity", while benefitting from Prada's "industrial capabilities, retail execution and operational expertise". The deal bucks the trend of recent years, which has seen major names in Italian fashion such as Gucci, Fendi, and Bottega Veneta fall under the control of their French competitors. "Prada will be able to bring light back into a brand that was dying and infuse it with new life," Antonio Bandini Conti, a design consultant, told AFP. However, a previous attempt to expand the Prada portfolio -- which also includes luxury footwear brands Car Shoe and Church's -- offers a cautionary tale. In 1999, the family group acquired the German brand Jil Sander and the Austrian label Helmut Lang before selling them in 2006 as they were weighing down its financial results. In 2000, Prada jointly acquired a 51 percent stake in the Roman label Fendi with LVMH, but sold its 25.5 percent stake to the French luxury giant a year later. With the Versace acquisition, "I see a risk for Prada to become distracted from its core business," Luca Solca, an analyst at Bernstein, told AFP.

Join the leading maritime news network U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth shakes hands with Panama's President Jose Raul Mulino, in Panama City, Panama April 9, 2025. REUTERS/Aris Martinez U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced an expanded partnership with Panama aimed at securing the Panama Canal against what he termed “China’s maligned influence” in the region. During a joint press conference with Panamanian Public Security Minister Frank Abrego, Hegseth declared that “The era of capitulating to coercion by the communist Chinese is over.” The announcement came during a three-day security conference in Panama City. The partnership includes a signed memorandum of understanding for cooperative security activities and an upcoming declaration specifically focused on canal security and operations. This new framework will provide U.S. warships and auxiliary vessels “first and free” passage through the canal. A key component of the agreement involves reestablishing American military presence at several former U.S. installations, including Rodman Naval Station, Howard Air Force Base, and Fort Sherman. Currently, the U.S. has deployed significant military assets to the region, including two guided-missile cruisers, a Coast Guard cutter, four F-18 fighter jets, and over 1,000 service members. The agreement follows President Trump’s controversial threats to “take back” the Panama Canal from Chinese influence—a claim strongly refuted by the Panamanian government. To address U.S. concerns, a consortium led by the American investment firm BlackRock reached a deal in March to acquire Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison’s port operations at both ends of the canal, a move that Beijing has widely criticized. The deal has yet to close. Trump also previously criticized what he called “exorbitant tolls” charged for American ships, claiming the U.S. “foolishly gave away” the canal. The Panama Canal Authority confirmed the agreement in an official announcement highlighting that the declaration reaffirms Panamanian sovereignty over the waterway and compliance with strict anti-discrimination requirements established by the 1977 Neutrality Treaty between Panama and the U.S. The agreement also includes provisions for developing compensation mechanisms for services provided to military vessels. The enhanced partnership extends beyond canal security to include joint efforts in combating regional criminal enterprises and border security. Notably, Panama has achieved a 99% reduction in illegal border crossings at the Darién Gap over the past year. The USNS Comfort, a U.S. Navy hospital ship, is scheduled to visit Panama this summer to provide medical care and strengthen bilateral relations.

Title: How CEOs Beat Trump on Tariffs

Time Published: 2025-04-10T14:40:29Z
Full Content:
It took a mere 13 hours for the Trump administration to cave on their reciprocal tariff scheme. President Donald Trump, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and Trade Advisor Peter Navarro did exactly what they said they would not do—“back off” of the non-negotiable trade measures. More perplexing is that no significant trade concession was gained from a single country during the brief period of “maximum leverage.” But a self-congratulatory tone was adopted after announcing a 90-day pause on the reciprocal tariffs. Advertisement Advertisement While the President may have been able to confront retaliatory tariffs from foreign partners and diffuse public demonstrations against DOGE actions, he was ultimately unable to stand up to the growing chorus of CEOs condemning his administration’s tariff agenda. Under the threat of aggressor trade tactics, U.S. stocks shed more than $6.5 trillion in two days. And more market pain looked likely as corporate quarterly earnings were just beginning to be released, with growth forecasts being revised downwards. Moreover, Treasury yields and the dollar’s value appeared to be breaking with conventional trade norms during similar periods of crisis, fueling rumors of the two assets losing their coveted “safe-haven” status—and threatening the interest rate discounts on U.S. corporate debt associated with that status. Simply put, CEOs had enough. JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon admitted a recession is “a likely outcome” as tariffs were "beyond what people expected." Delta Airlines CEO Ed Bastian pulled the company’s financial forecast for the year “given broad economic uncertainty around global trade.” BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told an audience at the Economic Club of New York that most business leaders from his portfolio companies “say we are probably in a recession right now.” These three instances are but a few of the many recent statements of defiance from all corners of the business community, including finance, transportation, housing, autos, technology, and general manufacturing—led by other titans of industry, from Tesla’s Elon Musk to Ford’s Jim Farley to Alcoa’s Bill Oplinger as well as trade association leaders such as Jay Timmons of the National Association of Manufacturers and Suzanne Clark of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Last month, in fact, at Yale’s CEO Caucus, 100 top CEOs told us they would begin to speak out against Trump if the stock market fell by approximately 20%. Business executives did exactly that as the markets surpassed or flirted with the threshold. Collectively, they punctured the threats and self-inflicted suffering in a challenge directed towards the president. Despite the moderate trade relief, CEOs remain confused and concerned with the continued delays and whiplash reversals by the administration. The uncertainty has stalled business investment and stymied the potential boon in opportunities from deregulation. Many have expressed a loss of confidence in the president’s economic policy agenda. Trump has placed himself in a precarious situation. In corporate leaders’ minds, the blame rests not only on Trump but also Navarro and Lutnick. Both have lost credibility after reversing course on the negotiability of tariffs. In an interview last week on CNN, Lutnick said, “I don't think there's any chance…President Trump's going to back off his tariffs.” On the same day, Navarro went on air to declare “this [tariff doctrine] is not a negotiation.” The trade advisor then doubled down in an op-ed with the Financial Times. It is Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent who adopted the opposite message to his two colleagues in the internal feud over the White House’s trade strategy. Wednesday’s market relief in response to Trump’s Truth Social post indicates the President may have quelled some of the jitters of nervous traders but not those of CEOs. Business leaders might have stopped him from driving the U.S. economy off a cliff, but it remains teetering on the edge. The conflicting details from White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, Bessent, and Trump did not provide business leaders enough confidence to end their pause on capital investments or M&A. After more firm details behind the pause emerged, initial excitement tempered. Some analysts even expect the new tariff policy to be just as economically painful. The 10% base tariff was not rescinded. Tariffs on China were ratcheted up to 145% from 104% as punishment for retaliation, despite the European Union approving retaliatory tariffs of their own hours before. The tariff stance on Canada and Mexico were not affected, nor were existing tariffs on the auto, steel, aluminum, lumber, and other sectors rescinded. Tariffs on the pharmaceutical and semiconductor industries are still reportedly under consideration. The heightened sense of uncertainty that forced small business confidence to plunge by 50%, labor market conditions to deteriorate, capital spending to stall, and GDP growth forecasts to plummet still remains. Before any reciprocal tariff announcements, 89% of CEOs said at our CEO Caucus in March that they were increasingly concerned the US economy is heading towards a recession, while 69% said the administration would be bad for the economy. Nearly all leaders supported the use of selective tariffs, like most of the American public, but not those that are generalized or reciprocal. And as four-fifths of CEOs reported apologizing for Trump’s behavior to their international counterparts, some of those same longtime foreign trade partners are having exploratory conversations with China to expand commercial ties. Perhaps Musk best described the current tariff policy on X amid his public feud with Navarro. Musk called Trump’s trade advisor “dumber than a sack of bricks." Seems appropriate, but then again, that characterization might be unfair to bricks. The trade policy uncertainty continues to present significant challenges for business leaders, disrupting long-term planning, investment decisions, and global supply chain strategies. The recent decision to pause reciprocal tariffs might be a small “win” for leaders. They are hoping the President has learned a lesson here. © 2025 TIME USA, LLC. All Rights Reserved.

April 10, 2025 10:30 ET | Source: AstuteAnalytica India Pvt. Ltd. AstuteAnalytica India Pvt. Ltd. Chicago, April 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The global biopharmaceutical logistics market was valued at US$ 135.88 billion in 2024 and is expected to reach US$ 252.20 billion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 7.24% during the forecast period 2025-2033. The biopharmaceutical logistics market is undergoing rapid globalization, with manufacturers and logistics providers increasingly targeting high-growth regions such as Asia-Pacific, Latin America, and Africa. By 2024, India and China collectively account for 35% of global pharmaceutical production, leveraging their cost-efficient labor pools and pro-business regulatory reforms. Emerging markets now represent 45% of the $1.6 trillion global biopharma industry, according to IQVIA, but infrastructure bottlenecks—such as fragmented transport networks and unreliable cold chain storage—continue to hinder seamless operations. Request Sample Pages: https://www.astuteanalytica.com/request-sample/bio-pharmaceutical-logistics-market To address these challenges, multinational firms like UPS Healthcare and DHL Supply Chain are investing over $500 million annually in regional hubs, exemplified by Singapore’s Life Sciences & Healthcare Campus, which serves as a gateway to Southeast Asia. Cross-border trade agreements in the biopharmaceutical logistics market, such as the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), are simplifying regulatory harmonization and slashing transit times by 20%. However, geopolitical tensions, including shipping disruptions in the Red Sea and U.S.-China trade friction, are forcing companies to adopt dual sourcing strategies for critical raw materials. Localized manufacturing via modular facilities, such as Samsung Biologics’ “Plug-and-Play” plants, is reducing dependence on centralized production hubs while accelerating market entry. Despite a projected CAGR of 7.24% through 2033, this globalization wave demands agile risk management frameworks to navigate trade volatility and ensure supply chain resilience. Key Findings in Biopharmaceutical Logistics Market Cold Chain Innovations Tackle Temperature Sensitivity of Advanced Therapies With biologics like mRNA vaccines and CAR-T cell therapies dominating 70% of the US$ 135.88 billion biopharmaceutical logistics market (2024), maintaining ultra-low temperatures has become a critical focus. Products such as CRISPR-based gene therapies require storage as low as -150°C, driving demand for cryogenic solutions like B Medical Systems’ nitrogen-powered containers. IoT-enabled sensors, including Controlant’s real-time monitoring devices, have reduced temperature deviations by 25% per WHO data, while blockchain platforms like MediLedger ensure tamper-proof documentation. Regulatory mandates, notably the EU’s revised GDP Annex 15, now enforce 99.99% temperature accuracy, catalyzing $3.2 billion in annual investments in cold chain infrastructure. Despite progress, 30% of global biopharma shipments still face delays due to underdeveloped airport cold rooms in regions like Africa and Southeast Asia. Hybrid solutions combining passive cooling (e.g., WHO-certified insulated boxes) with active refrigeration are gaining traction, supported by initiatives like the USDA’s $2 billion cold chain initiative in India. Predictive analytics tools, such as Tive Solo, are cutting spoilage costs by $15 billion annually by forecasting risks like customs holdups or equipment failures. The rise of autologous therapies, which require patient-specific logistics, is further pushing the industry toward decentralized “just-in-time” delivery models—innovation that demands reconfigurable cold chain networks to balance speed and precision. Digitalization Unlocks End-to-End Visibility and Predictive Supply Chain Control Digital transformation has reshaped biopharmaceutical logistics market in 2024, with 80% of top-tier companies deploying AI-driven platforms to optimize decision-making. Tools like SAP Integrated Business Planning have slashed inventory waste by 18% through hyper-accurate demand forecasting, while machine learning algorithms from Blue Yonder improve route efficiency by 22%. Cloud-based transport management systems (TMS), such as Oracle’s platform, centralize data across 30+ supply chain touchpoints, reducing administrative overheads by $7 million annually per enterprise. Blockchain adoption is surging, with 60% of vaccine shipments now tracked via Hyperledger Fabric to combat counterfeiting and ensure compliance. Digital twins, which simulate supply chain disruptions, enabled Pfizer to reroute 30% of COVID-19 vaccine shipments faster during 2023’s Hurricane Ian. Nevertheless, fragmented legacy systems remain a hurdle for the biopharmaceutical logistics market: 40% of mid-sized biotechs still rely on manual Excel tracking, doubling error rates. Cybersecurity risks have also escalated, with attacks on shipment data rising 200% since 2022—pushing firms to adopt Zero Trust Architecture, a US$ 1.8 billion market by 2024. The integration of 5G-enabled IoT devices provides real-time monitoring of temperature-sensitive CRISPR therapies, ensuring sub-second response times to anomalies. With Astute Analytica estimating US$ 21.7 billion spent on digital logistics this year, the sector is racing to balance innovation with operational continuity. Serialization Mandates Reshape Compliance Amid Regulatory Fragmentation Global regulatory pressures are intensifying, with the FDA’s 2024 DSCSA deadline compelling 90% of U.S. pharma firms to adopt item-level serialization. Similarly, the EU’s Falsified Medicines Directive (FMD) mandates tamper-proof packaging for 95% of biologics, costing manufacturers $5 million annually per product line. China’s National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) now requires blockchain-based serialization in the biopharmaceutical logistics market, which has reduced counterfeit biologics by 40% since 2023. Aggregated systems like Systech’s UniSeries accelerate validation by enabling pallet-to-unit traceability, cutting compliance time by 50%. Interoperability gaps, however, persist: reconciling U.S. GS1 standards with China’s MMDS system adds $2.3 billion in annual costs in the market. Post-Brexit complexities, such as dual UK/EU labeling rules, have raised operational expenses by 18% for firms like AstraZeneca. To streamline compliance, 70% of companies now use AI-driven platforms like TrackTraceRX to automate 80% of documentation, while FDA warning letters for GDP non-compliance surged 35% in 2023 over storage validation lapses. Emerging markets in the biopharmaceutical logistics market like Brazil are tightening rules—Anvisa’s RDC 430 now mandates temperature data loggers for all cold chain shipments—forcing smaller logistics players to partner with tech providers. While organizations like PIC/S aim to harmonize regulations, slow progress continues to delay biologics’ time-to-market by 6–12 months. Personalized Medicine’s Rise Demands Precision Logistics Overhauls The US$ 82 billion personalized medicine market requires logistics networks tailored to therapies like CAR-T, which have a 72-hour viability window. AmerisourceBergen’s World Courier delivers over 300 CAR-T doses monthly via GPS-tracked, IoT-enabled shippers, while Cryoport’s nitrogen vapor systems maintain -170°C for stem cell therapies, achieving a 0.1% failure rate. However, 25% of apheresis centers lack same-day airport access, prompting DHL to deploy mobile collection units. Wherein, gene therapies pose unique hurdles to the biopharmaceutical logistics market: adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors degrade above -65°C, necessitating solutions like CSafe’s RKN shippers with proprietary phase-change materials. Real-time patient monitoring via CRISPR-based biosensors (e.g., NanoString) triggers dynamic routing for treatments like Vertex’s exa-cel sickle cell therapy. Decentralized clinical trials, now 45% of studies, require localized distribution across 50+ countries, pressuring firms like IQVIA to establish micro-fulfillment hubs. Payers are pushing back against logistics costs, which account for $500,000 per CAR-T dose, driving investments in scalable “hub-and-spoke” networks to cut last-mile expenses by 30%. With AI tools predicting patient adherence (e.g., Novo Nordisk’s Rybelsus® refill algorithms), the sector must align agility with affordability. Personalized medicine is projected to drive 65% of logistics investments through 2030, but only through hyper-specialized infrastructure can the industry meet this demand sustainably. Sustainability Gains Momentum with Green Logistics and Carbon-Neutral Transport Sustainability has become non-negotiable for biopharmaceutical logistics market, with supply chains contributing 8% of global CO2 emissions. Sixty percent of the top 50 firms now adhere to science-based targets (SBTi), committing to 45% emission cuts by 2030. DHL’s GoGreen Plus program offsets 30% of air freight emissions via sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) credits, while Pfizer’s EcoBox initiative eliminates 25 million pounds of annual waste through reusable packaging. Innovations like Sonoco Thermosafe’s eutectic phase-change materials reduce energy consumption by 40% compared to traditional refrigeration. Solar-powered warehouses, such as FedEx’s Los Angeles hub, cut facility emissions by 90%, and electric trucks like the Tesla Semi handle 20% of U.S. middle-mile distribution. Despite progress, 70% of shippers in the biopharmaceutical logistics market still use polystyrene coolants, which take 500+ years to decompose. Regulatory risks loom: EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) could penalize non-compliant firms up to $4 million annually. EcoVadis ratings now influence 35% of logistics contracts, compelling suppliers to adopt ISO 14001 standards. While SAF remains 300% costlier than conventional fuel, coalitions like ClearBlue aim for price parity by 2026. Investors are reinforcing this shift: BlackRock reports 99% of institutions prioritize ESG metrics in 2024, making green logistics a strategic imperative rather than an optional benchmark. View the Table of Contents to select and purchase individual chapters: https://www.astuteanalytica.com/industry-report/toc/bio-pharmaceutical-logistics-market Urbanization and Patient-Centric Models Revolutionize Last-Mile Delivery Urbanization, with 68% of the global population in cities by 2024, has intensified demand for rapid, temperature-controlled last-mile delivery in the biopharmaceutical logistics market. Same-day service now covers 40% of critical biologics, led by Amazon Pharmacy and Capsule’s urban networks. In Rwanda, Zipline’s drones deliver 10,000+ vaccines daily, slashing transit times from 4 hours to 15 minutes. However, 60% of U.S. patients reside in “pharmacy deserts,” prompting Walgreens to deploy micro-fulfillment centers for extended reach. Precision temperature control is paramount: Tesla’s refrigerated vans maintain 2–8°C with 98% accuracy versus 85% for legacy fleets. Crowdsourced platforms like Uber Health reduce costs by 25%, but stolen oncology shipments rose 15% in 2023, underscoring security risks. Predictive routing via Locus Robotics cuts delivery times by 30%, though 50% of APAC countries lack standardized addressing systems for precision logistics. Patient-centric adherence tools, such as Phil’s GPS-enabled inhalers, automatically trigger refills, necessitating dynamic inventory management at UPS’s metropolitan hubs. Regulatory bottlenecks, including FAA restrictions on long-range drones, delay U.S. adoption of aerial delivery. Despite a projected $35 billion market for last-mile biopharma logistics in 2024, labor shortages—a 1.2 million driver deficit in the U.S.—and rising “clicks-to-bricks” returns (up 25%) challenge scalability, demanding smarter automation and workforce strategies. Climate and Geopolitical Risks Demand Proactive Supply Chain Mitigation Climate disasters cost the biopharmaceutical logistics market a US$12 billion in 2023, highlighted by Hurricane Fiona’s disruption of Puerto Rico’s pharma exports, which supply 10% of global APIs. Concurrently, geopolitical volatility, such as the Red Sea shipping crisis, extended lead times by 21 days, pushing 60% of firms to nearshore API production. Everstream Analytics’ AI-driven risk platforms now redirect 30% of shipments preemptively, while dual sourcing strategies—employed by Pfizer for lipid nanoparticle suppliers—cover 80% of critical materials versus 40% in 2021. Insurance costs have spiked 40% due to war exclusions, accelerating the shift to parametric models like Swiss Re’s NatCat for faster claims. The 2023 Phoenix city heatwave destroyed $150 million in insulin through temperature excursions, spurring adoption of climate-resilient packaging like Va-Q-tec’s PHCbi. Moreover, sanctions on Russian airspace forced reroutes via Kazakhstan, raising 2024 fuel costs by 18%. Post-pandemic buffer stockpiling costs $8 billion annually in the biopharmaceutical logistics market, even as firms pivot to multi-modal options—30% of temperature-sensitive cargo now moves via blockchain-secured rail (e.g., DB Schenker’s PharmaRail). Proactive risk management, now a $4.5 billion market, is no longer optional but a cornerstone of supply chain viability in an era of compounding disruptions. Future Outlook: AI, Circular Supply Chains, and Regionalization Redefine Logistics By 2033, AI will govern 50% of biopharmaceutical logistics market’s decisions, with generative models like GPT-5 automating 70% of customs paperwork. Autonomous robotics, including Boston Dynamics’ Stretch, will manage 30% of warehouses, achieving 99.9% picking accuracy. Apart from this, the circular economy will dominate, as 90% of packaging transitions to blockchain-tracked reusable loops, exemplified by Loop Industries’ partnership with GSK. Regionalized manufacturing, such as BioNTech’s mRNA “BioNTainer” facilities, will slash transport needs by 40%, while 4D-printed vaccines from MIT could eliminate cold chain dependencies. However, monopolization risks loom: Amazon, DHL, and UPS control 65% of the logistics market, prompting antitrust scrutiny. Space logistics partnerships, like SpaceX’s polar satellite launches, may expedite global distribution, while quantum computing could optimize routes in milliseconds.

Title: Stock futures slide even as inflation cools. Tesla, Apple, and Amazon slip as bank earnings loom

Stocks closed sharply down on Thursday as investors digested a wave of economic uncertainty, including tariff tensions, inflation data, and a string of downbeat corporate signals. The Nasdaq sank 4.3%, while the S&P 500 dropped 3.5% and the Dow fell 2.5%. The Russell 2000 Index, a benchmark for small-cap stocks, slid 4%. Big Tech led the losses: Apple fell more than 4%, Amazon dropped over 5%, and Tesla slumped more than 7%. Used-car retailer CarMax was one of the day’s biggest losers, closing down 17% after a disappointing earnings report and broader concerns about the auto sector. Looking ahead, Friday will bring a wave of bank earnings, with JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and others set to report — offering fresh insight into credit conditions and consumer resilience. Investors will also parse new economic data, including producer price inflation figures, for clues about the path of interest rates. Markets fell sharply Thursday, giving back a big chunk of Wednesday’s huge rally. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1,693 points in early-afternoon trading, or about 4.2%, after its historic 3,000-point surge the day before, The S&P 500 fell 4.9%, and the Nasdaq dropped 5.7%, with shares of the Magnificent Seven tech giants leading the retreat: Apple (AAPL+4.60%) stock slid 6%, Tesla (TSLA-0.62%) dropped 10%, and Amazon (AMZN+1.51%) fell more than 6.5%. Shopify (SHOP-2.05%) stock tumbled more than 9%. Used car stocks were hit especially hard after CarMax’s earnings miss, with CarMax stock down almost 20% and Carvana (CVNA-1.71%) off 10%. The pullback reflects lingering skepticism around President Donald Trump’s 90-day pause on sweeping tariffs, which arrived even more abruptly than the trade war policy itself. Markets seem reluctant to trust a policy pivot that arrived without warning — even as inflation data offered some welcome relief. The Consumer Price Index showed that core inflation, which excludes food and energy, rose just 0.1% in March, the slowest monthly pace in nine months. Year-over-year, core prices climbed 2.8%, marking the tamest reading since mid-2021. CarMax’s (KMX+2.00%) fiscal fourth-quarter results, also released Thursday morning, revealed mixed performance amid a volatile market environment. The company reported net revenues of $6 billion, a 6.7% increase from the previous year. Earnings per diluted share rose to $0.58, up 81.3% from $0.32 a year ago. However, this fell short of analysts’ expectations of $0.66 per share. Friday will bring a wave of first-quarter results from some of the biggest names in finance, giving investors a deeper look at how the bulge bracket and other banking behemoths are navigating 2025’s economic uncertainty. JPMorgan Chase (JPM+3.58%) will be closely watched for signals on loan growth, credit quality, and net interest margins — the critical metrics that show how it’s managing in a high-rate, low-visibility environment. Any signs of tightening credit or weakening consumer demand could ripple across the market. Wells Fargo’s (WFC-2.13%) numbers will offer a window into consumer lending, where even small shifts in behavior can signal broader household strain. With recession chatter back on the table, analysts are looking for clues about how the bank is adjusting its exposure. Asset manager BlackRock (BLK+2.40%) will report amid surging volatility and massive swings in investor sentiment. Its earnings should reveal whether clients are retreating into cash or leaning into risk — and where the big money is flowing. Morgan Stanley (MS+0.28%) will round out the Friday slate, with attention on investment banking fees and deal activity. With M&A pipelines reportedly thinning and IPOs still scarce, the results could help gauge the depth of Wall Street’s current dealmaking drought.

Title: Tariffs, Toyotas, and truth tests: Stocks and data to watch today

Wall Street staged a dramatic rebound yesterday after President Donald Trump abruptly delayed parts of his planned tariff rollout — pausing some retaliatory measures while reaffirming steep duties on Chinese EVs and tech imports. The 90-day pause, announced just hours before the tariffs were set to take effect, jolted stocks and rocked major indices. The about-face sparked a frenzied rebound, with the Nasdaq jumping 12.1% (its second-biggest gain on record) and the Dow surging more than 3,000 points for the first time in history. Early this morning, futures point lower, with the Nasdaq down 2%, the S&P 500 falling 1.8%, and the Dow off 1.4%. The whiplash signals investors are still weighing the implications of a tariff truce that arrived as abruptly as the policy itself — redirecting billions in market value overnight and igniting questions about how and why market-moving decisions are made. The Fear & Greed Index — which tracks market sentiment using indicators such as momentum, volatility, and demand for safe havens — jumped 14 points intraday yet remained in “Extreme Fear” territory. It was a move that suggested investors were trading the bounce, not buying the rally. The 90-day tariff pause also sent shockwaves beyond U.S. borders. Japan’s Nikkei 225 surged nearly 10%, marking one of its most significant gains in recent years. The European Union announced a corresponding 90-day delay in its planned retaliatory tariffs. Fresh CPI data released Thursday morning offered a dose of relief: Core inflation, which excludes food and energy, rose just 0.1% in March—the slowest monthly pace in nine months. Year-over-year, core prices climbed 2.8%, marking the tamest reading since mid-2021. CarMax’s (KMX+2.00%) fiscal fourth-quarter results, also released Thursday morning, revealed mixed performance amid a volatile market environment. The company reported net revenues of $6.0 billion, a 6.7% increase from the previous year. Earnings per diluted share rose to $0.58, up 81.3% from $0.32 a year ago. However, this fell short of analysts’ expectations of $0.66 per share. Carmax stock was down nearly 8% before market open. Friday will bring a wave of first-quarter results from some of the biggest names in finance, giving investors a deeper look at how the bulge bracket and other banking behemoths are navigating 2025’s economic uncertainty. JPMorgan Chase (JPM+3.58%) will be closely watched for signals on loan growth, credit quality, and net interest margins — critical metrics that show how it’s managing in a high-rate, low-visibility environment.

Title: The market's trade war roller coaster rides on. Here's what to watch next

Wall Street staged a dramatic rebound Wednesday after President Donald Trump abruptly hit pause on sweeping tariffs for most countries. The 90-day delay — announced shortly after the duties took effect — whipsawed stocks and rocked major indices. But a little more than an hour before markets opened Thursday, stocks looked poised to slump again. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were down 537 points, or 1.3%, while S&P 500 futures were off 1.7% and Nasdaq futures were off 2.1%. After Trump announced the pause on Wednesday, the Nasdaq surged 12.1% — its second-biggest daly gain on record — while the Dow jumped more than 3,000 points for the first time in history, closing up 8%. The S&P 500 rose 9.5%. Some of the market’s most battered names led the charge, with Apple (AAPL+4.60%) stock rising 15%, both Nvidia (NVDA+2.93%) and Intel (INTC-3.28%) jumping more than 18%, and Tesla (TSLA-0.62%) rallying 23%. Meta (META-0.97%) and Amazon (AMZN+1.51%) also logged double-digit gains, underscoring how sudden, top-down policy reversals don’t just move markets. They redistribute billions of dollars to those positioned — and in fact publicly encouraged — to capitalize. Here’s what to watch on Thursday. CarMax (KMX+2.00%) reports earnings Thursday morning, with analysts expecting earnings per share of $0.66 on $5.97 billion in revenue — up sharply from $0.32 per share a year ago. As the top U.S. used car seller, CarMax is a key gauge of consumer health. Used car sales straddle interest rates, credit access, and household budgets, making them a prime barometer of macro pressure. Softening demand or tighter lending could flag middle-class strain, especially among subprime buyers. And with CarMax offering in-house financing, any signs of rising delinquencies or tightened credit standards may echo the recessionary signals analysts fear could appear in bank earnings Friday. The first major financial firms to report, BlackRock (BLK+2.40%) and Morgan Stanley (MS+0.28%), will kick off bank earnings season Friday morning. BlackRock’s results are expected to shed light on investor risk appetite and ETF flow trends in a choppy bond market. That’s because few institutions offer a clearer window into where money is actually moving. BlackRock reflects bond market demand primarily through its fixed income fund flows. As the world’s largest asset manager, with over $10 trillion AUM, it runs a massive range of ETFs and mutual funds that track everything from short-term Treasuries to junk bonds. If investors are running from risk — or chasing yield — BlackRock’s books may demonstrate the shift. Morgan Stanley, meanwhile, offers a read on the health of deal-making and IPO activity — both of which have slowed amid rising rates and global uncertainty. Together, the two are likely to set the tone for how Wall Street is navigating 2025’s volatile whiplash economy.

Title: Blockchain: The Operating System For Global Finance
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/roomykhan/2025/04/10/blockchain-the-operating-system-for-global-finance/
Time Published: 2025-04-10T11:43:33Z

ByRoomy Khan ByRoomy Khan, Contributor. Block chain network technology Blockchain infrastructure ↔ Traditional financeDigital assets ↔ Real-world usageStartups and protocols ↔ Institutional systems In November 2024, while crypto headlines fixated on volatility, the European Investment Bank (EIB) issued a €100 million digital bond on HSBC’s Orion platform—settling the same day using wholesale central bank digital currency (wCBDC) tokens issued by the Banque de France. Days later, Goldman Sachs announced plans to spin out its GS DAP® blockchain platform into an industry-owned utility. Neither event made headlines, yet both signal a profound shift in global finance. These aren’t innovation lab pilots—they’re strategic moves by financial titans rebuilding the core infrastructure powering traditional finance. Blockchain isn’t disrupting Wall Street; it’s becoming its operating system. While headlines obsess over Bitcoin, the real shift is happening quietly. Institutions are laying tracks beneath the surface—moving trillions, settling trades, and weaving decentralization into the foundations of financial infrastructure. This is about the mechanics of how money moves—legacy systems controlled by intermediaries, burdened by high costs and delays, or blockchain rails enabling direct, peer-to-peer, atomic settlement. By embedding itself into the plumbing of global finance, blockchain is rewiring the system from within—driving the most significant transformation since electronic trading replaced floor brokers. Just as cloud computing became the invisible backbone of digital ecosystems, blockchain is rapidly becoming the core of global finance. That transformation is already shaping tomorrow’s winners and losers. Whether you're investing, leading a company, or building financial products, understanding the ecosystem is essential to smart decision-making. It comes down to grasping how these once-separate worlds are converging—and recognizing the key players making it all work. This isn’t theoretical. It’s actively reshaping competitive dynamics, creating new opportunities, and rendering old models obsolete. Once dismissed as speculative, blockchain is now a strategic priority for institutions like JPMorgan, BlackRock, and Goldman Sachs. Blockchain is quietly reengineering a financial system that supports more than $100 trillion in global capital markets and moves trillions daily. The shift has been deliberate and strategic—years in the making, but now rapidly gaining traction. What was once seen as a fringe experiment is now deeply embedded in traditional financial infrastructure. Institutions are embracing blockchain not for speculation but for cost savings through improved efficiency—streamlining operations, eliminating intermediaries through peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions, and enabling atomic settlement. JPMorgan moves trillions via JPM Coin. BlackRock issues Bitcoin ETFs and integrates blockchain into its $10 trillion portfolio infrastructure. Goldman Sachs, once cautious, is now leaning in—expanding its digital assets desk and signaling that blockchain isn’t a side bet; it’s part of the long game. And rather than being sidelined, Visa and Mastercard are weaving blockchain into their payment systems—Visa alone processed billions of dollars in crypto transactions in 2024. This isn't capitulation—it's evolution. These giants are using blockchain to streamline systems, improve liquidity, and boost transparency. Still, some of the most transformative innovations are coming from agile startups—solving inefficiencies in payments, trading, and consumer incentives. The companies mentioned illustrate broader trends, not endorsements or prescribed winners. They offer a glimpse into a larger shift—one driven by thousands of startups, protocols, and infrastructure providers reshaping the foundation of global finance. Unlike traditional finance's siloed systems, blockchain is built for composability—where financial applications plug into one another like Lego bricks, driving rapid innovation and more connected services. This modular architecture enables developers to stack functions—trading, lending, staking, identity, settlement—into seamless user experiences. It’s most visible in DeFi, where protocols like Aave, Uniswap, and Lido integrate natively, accelerating innovation without the friction of closed systems. But composability extends beyond DeFi. As tokenized assets, on-chain identity, and payment networks evolve, the same plug-and-play architecture is beginning to reshape how institutions build and deploy financial products and infrastructure. Composability doesn't just speed up product cycles—it unlocks entirely new value chains. A lending app can tap into yield protocols or tokenized collateral instantly—without the bottlenecks of backend integrations or clearinghouse approvals. In this emerging financial stack, the winners aren't just fast—they're interoperable. Concept of mobile payments. Wallet connected with mobile phone. The structural limitations of crypto as a medium of real-world payment have long hindered its adoption. Digital assets remained siloed in wallets and exchanges, cut off from everyday financial systems. But that barrier is starting to break down—not by replacing payment giants, but by building infrastructure that bridges the two worlds. In fact, payment giants like Mastercard and Visa have accelerator programs focused on integrating targeted crypto solutions that can plug into existing systems, creating corridors between traditional and decentralized financial systems. Hong Kong-based Aurum exemplifies this approach, enabling users to fund accounts with USDT and spend in local currencies. Its ecosystem offers bots, payment cards, staking, NFT licenses, and a Web3 wallet with low fees and cashback rewards. With $12M in funding, Aurum delivers institutional-grade trading and payment infrastructure powered by advanced AI, complementing traditional financial networks. Former Binance executive Bryan Benson now leads Aurum Exchange, bringing expertise in scaling crypto platforms across emerging markets. The endgame? A world where crypto wallets function seamlessly with traditional payment systems, making digital assets as spendable as cash—without friction. For decades, financial markets have been plagued by opacity, insider advantages, and inefficiencies. The blockchain era is changing that dynamic. Institutions like State Street ($43T AUM) and BNY Mellon ($46.7T in assets under custody), with their extensive trading operations and market influence, are already implementing blockchain-based trade settlement solutions, ensuring real-time transaction verification and eliminating counterparty risks. In the retail trading landscape, Spotware's cTrader stands as a notable example of transparency while delivering sophisticated trading infrastructure. Built on its Traders First™ principles, cTrader aims to establish high standards for fairness, transparency, and security—tackling long-standing industry challenges and helping to level the playing field for all participants. The platform's technology handles millions of transactions daily, connecting over 8 million traders and more than 250 brokers and prop firms to global markets. Specialized infrastructure providers power this shift—the hidden backbone behind evolving trading systems. These providers don't serve end users directly—they power those who do, underpinning the next generation of financial infrastructure. Fireblocks secures over $4 trillion in digital assets for institutions, ensuring transparent custody and seamless settlement. Chainlink delivers tamper-proof price data to more than 1,900 projects, forming the foundation of reliable price discovery. Circle's USDC moves across exchanges, wallets, and payment systems, enabling instant, transparent fund transfers. Together, these firms are becoming the "essential middleware" layer of global finance—quietly powering billions in daily activity. Beyond efficiency, blockchain is redefining who gets to participate in wealth creation. Blockchain’s most powerful shift may be this: turning real-world value into liquid, on-chain capital—making static assets move, trade, and work for more people than ever before. Tokenization is fast becoming the gateway to unlocking trillions in dormant capital. By converting assets like treasury bills, real estate, and private credit into blockchain-based tokens, platforms are transforming illiquid markets into accessible, tradable units. The impact? Fractional ownership, 24/7 settlement, and borderless access. Major asset managers such as Franklin Templeton, BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, and HSBC are leading this transformation by developing tokenized investment products. Their participation lends institutional credibility to this emerging market, much like ETFs did for equities decades ago. Similarly, financial institutions like JPMorgan and State Street are laying the groundwork to bring traditional assets on-chain, recognizing tokenization's far-reaching benefits. Tokenized assets are projected to reach $2 trillion by 2030, led by cash deposits, bonds, mutual funds, and loans. Their appeal? Mobility, real-time settlement, programmability, and transparency—infused into markets once defined by slow processes, siloed systems, and rigid structures. 8lends by Maclear exemplifies this trend, offering USDC-backed loans to vetted businesses, making passive investing more accessible. Their platform combines blockchain transparency with the familiarity of traditional finance, eliminating cumbersome procedures and accreditation requirements. Smart contracts automate the entire process, delivering predictable returns with complete on-chain visibility. This represents a foundational shift in financial infrastructure. Tokenization is not only expanding access to investment opportunities—it’s reducing friction, unlocking liquidity, and streamlining capital flows across the global economy. The future of finance won't be defined by crypto replacing banks or banks neutralizing crypto. It will emerge at their intersection—where the trust, scale, and regulatory expertise of traditional institutions fuse with the transparency, efficiency, and programmability of blockchain technology. The boundary between these worlds isn't just blurring—it's beginning to vanish. Like the internet before it, blockchain is gradually disappearing into the background—becoming the invisible rails on which global finance runs. The future of money is being written in code. The biggest winners won't be those who merely accumulate tokens—but those who understand blockchain as foundational infrastructure. As blockchain dissolves into the conduits of global finance, it's becoming the architecture through which value will move, scale, and settle in the decade ahead.

Title: BlackRock Becomes Largest Investor In Adani Group's $750-Million Bond Issue

Funds managed by BlackRock, the global investment behemoth, emerged as the largest subscribers of the $750-million private bond issuance by the Adani Group. The US-based asset manager, overseeing $12 trillion in assets, has taken on one-third of the $750-million-issuance, which carries a tenure of 3-5 years, sources with direct knowledge of the matter said. This investment comes at a time when Adani Group officials are under scrutiny following a US Department of Justice (DOJ) indictment in a bribery case in November last year. BlackRock's move marks its first private placement in India's infrastructure sector -- a segment the firm is increasingly bullish on. "Infrastructure is one of the most exciting long-term investment opportunities, as a number of structural shifts re-shape the global economy," BlackRock Chairman Larry Fink had stated in January 2024, following the company's $12.5-billion acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), a major player in ports, power, and digital infrastructure. Aside from BlackRock, five other institutional investors -- primarily American and European -- also participated in the Adani Group's latest capital raise. These included funds managed by Sona Asset Management. The $750-million bond issue of Renew Exim DMCC, a wholly owned offshore entity of the Adani group promoter family, is to be used to finance acquisition of ITD Cementation and other growth avenues. The Adani Group views the entry of the world's largest investor as a strong vote of confidence, particularly at a time when its fundraising capabilities have been questioned due to the ongoing DOJ investigation. BlackRock's involvement also signals that it does not anticipate any significant operational disruptions for the conglomerate stemming from the legal proceedings. This marks the Adani Group's second private dollar bond issuance. In February, the group raised about $200 million for its Australian port operations. The latest raise -- almost four times larger -- is the most substantial since the DOJ indictment. The $750 million has been raised by Renew Exim, a private group-level entity, to finance the acquisition of ITD Cementation. Last year, the Adani Group announced the purchase of a 46.64 per cent stake in ITD Cementation for Rs 5,888.57 crore from its promoters, aiming to bolster its engineering capabilities in the infrastructure sector. Renew Exim has since acquired an additional 20.81 per cent through an open offer at Rs 400 per share. ITD Cementation, known for its work on key projects such as Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust and ports in Tuticorin, Mundra, and Vizhinjam, is seen as a strategic asset for Adani's long-term infrastructure ambitions.

This investment comes at a time when Adani Group officials are under scrutiny following a US Department of Justice (DOJ) indictment in a bribery case in November last year. BlackRock's move marks its first private placement in India's infrastructure sector, a segment the firm is increasingly bullish on. The $750 million has been raised by Renew Exim, a private group-level entity, to finance the acquisition of ITD Cementation. "Infrastructure is one of the most exciting long-term investment opportunities, as a number of structural shifts re-shape the global economy," BlackRock Chairman Larry Fink had stated in January 2024, following the company's $12.5-billion acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), a major player in ports, power, and digital infrastructure. Aside from BlackRock, five other institutional investors — primarily American and European — also participated in the Adani Group's latest capital raise. These included funds managed by Sona Asset Management. Asia shares jump after US stocks soared to historic gains on 90-day tariff pause The $750 million bond issue of Renew Exim DMCC, a wholly owned offshore entity of the Adani group promoter family, is to be used to finance acquisition of ITD Cementation and other growth avenues. The Adani Group views the entry of the world's largest investor as a strong vote of confidence, particularly at a time when its fundraising capabilities have been questioned due to the ongoing DOJ investigation. BlackRock's involvement also signals that it does not anticipate any significant operational disruptions for the conglomerate stemming from the legal proceedings. This marks the Adani Group's second private dollar bond issuance. In February, the group raised about $200 million for its Australian port operations. The latest raise, almost four times larger, is the most substantial since the DOJ indictment. Last year, the Adani Group announced the purchase of a 46.64 per cent stake in ITD Cementation for ₹5,888.57 crore from its promoters, aiming to bolster its engineering capabilities in the infrastructure sector. Renew Exim has since acquired an additional 20.81 per cent through an open offer at ₹400 per share. ITD Cementation, known for its work on key projects such as Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust and ports in Tuticorin, Mundra, and Vizhinjam, is seen as a strategic asset for Adani's long-term infrastructure ambitions.

Title: SEC approves Ethereum ETF options trading – All details here

Assessing ETH’s next move amid options and staking speculations on spot ETH ETFs. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved options trading for spot Ethereum [ETH] ETFs. The agency greenlighted options trading for BlackRock’s ETHA, Bitwise’s BITW, and Fidelity’s FETH. According to Nate Geraci of ETF Store, the update could attract more ETH investments. He noted, “SEC has approved options trading on spot eth ETFs…Like with BTC ETFs, expect to see a bunch of new launches from issuers.Covered call strategy ETH ETFs, buffer ETH ETFs, etc.” Despite the positive update, however, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart stated that the outcome was ‘100% expected’ because it was the deadline for the SEC decision. Simply put, ETH had priced in the outcome. But he added that staking on the products could be approved by early May or August, despite their October deadline. “Its possible they could be approved for staking early, but the final deadline is at the end of October.” Most experts expected staking approval to impact ETH demand and value more, especially from institutional investors seeking the extra 3% annual yield. In fact, some analysts believed that the lack of staking was partly to blame for spot ETH ETF’s lukewarm performance compared to BTC ETFs. Since their debut, the products have logged $2.3B in cumulative inflows. However, spot BTC ETFs recorded $35B in total inflows — that’s 17x time outperformance by BTC ETFs. That said, ETH jumped +10% from $1400 to $1600 on the 9th of April. This followed President Donald Trump’s 90-day pause on various tariffs. Hence, the options’ approval wasn’t a key catalyst for the price upswing. Even so, there was a notable spike in market interest for the altcoin, as revealed by the new high in April’s Social Volume. Source: Santiment But the sentiment was still negative to drive a sustainable recovery for ETH. On the 4-hour price chart, ETH had a bullish RSI divergence, which could signal that a likely recovery was in sight. However, the momentum could only be confirmed if the On Balance Volume (OBV) cleared the overhead hurdle (trendline resistance). Source: ETH/USDT, TradingView In conclusion, ETH price could stall near 50EMA ($1600) in the short term, like it did in the past few days. However, a decisive move and improved trading volume above the hurdle could push it higher. But the long-term recovery might hinge on a positive macro shift and likely ETH ETF staking approval.

April 10, 2025 04:58 ET | Source: BlocScale BlocScale LIJA, Malta, April 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BlocScale Launchpad is rewriting the narrative for the XRP Ledger, bringing real-world asset (RWA) tokenization to life while quickly establishing itself as the go-to launchpad platform for Web3 projects and businesses across emerging markets. As of March 2025, BlocScale has successfully raised over 14,000 XRP, surpassing its seed sale soft cap and capturing significant attention from the broader crypto community. With over 35% of its $BLOC Seed allocation already claimed, investors are positioning themselves early for what is shaping up to be one of the most critical infrastructure platforms on XRPL. PARTICIPATE IN $BLOC SEED SALE XRP Ledger Finally Enters the Real-World Tokenization Era For years, the XRP Ledger has been hailed for its speed, cost-efficiency, and enterprise-grade performance. However, one major gap has lingered—its lack of a native, decentralized launchpad capable of onboarding real-world businesses and tokenizing physical assets such as real estate, equity, and commodities. BlocScale Fills That Gap. BlocScale enables entrepreneurs, startups, and traditional businesses to tokenize real-world assets directly on XRPL. By using XRP’s built-in decentralized exchange (DEX) and trustline system, BlocScale offers a fully compliant, fast, and secure path to bring real-world assets on-chain. This innovation not only enhances capital access for businesses but also unlocks global investment opportunities through fractional ownership. Why Early Market Share Matters The market for real-world asset tokenization is projected to reach trillions of dollars in the coming years. Institutional players like BlackRock and JPMorgan have already made headlines exploring RWA tokenization. BlocScale is strategically positioned to dominate this niche on XRPL by being the first launchpad to actively facilitate these offerings. Capturing early market share in this space means BlocScale isn’t just a participant in XRPL’s growth—it’s helping to define the next chapter of blockchain utility on the ledger. JOIN $BLOC SEED SALE Growing Investor Confidence in $BLOC The rapid pace at which BlocScale’s $BLOC token seed round is progressing is a testament to investor belief in the platform’s mission. After a fully sold-out private sale, the current seed sale offers a chance to acquire $BLOC tokens at favorable rates before major exchange listings. $BLOC Seed Sale Details: Visit $BLOC Seed Sale Portal to purchase $BLOC tokens: https://www.blocscale.com/blocsale By holding $BLOC, investors gain access to project sales on BlocScale and can participate in future governance votes, including which projects get listed and what direction the platform takes. Looking Forward: What BlocScale Means for XRP’s Evolution BlocScale is becoming a strategic pillar in XRP Ledger’s evolution from a remittance-focused chain to a full-fledged hub for Web3 innovation, real-world tokenization, and capital formation. Here’s Why: Final Thoughts Real-world asset tokenization isn’t just a trend—it’s a transformation. And BlocScale Launchpad is leading that movement on XRP. As the seed round nears its hard cap and more projects line up for launch, BlocScale is proving that the future of capital markets is decentralized, tokenized, and accessible to all.

Title: Is the U.S. already in a recession? A closer examination (Prakash Bhudia)
URL: https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/28261/is-the-us-already-in-a-recession-a-closer-examination
Time Published: 2025-04-10T08:19:27Z
Full Content:
Economic discussions in the United States have increasingly revolved around one pivotal question: Are we already experiencing a recession or merely bracing for a downturn that has yet to emerge fully? Shifting corporate sentiment, considerable market volatility and ongoing trade disputes have all contributed to the conversation. Below is an in-depth look at several indicators-particularly the current tariff environment- that may be setting the stage for a potential economic downturn. President Trump’s tariffs are at the forefront. They were introduced to strengthen domestic industries and reduce trade imbalances. While those objectives remain a primary justification, the prevailing impact has been growing uncertainty among investors and heightened tensions in global commerce. These developments have led many analysts to question whether tariff policies might be hastening a slowdown by disrupting supply chains, raising production costs, and deterring new investments. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, garnered significant attention when he remarked that the United States may already be in the initial stages of a recession. He is not the only influential figure raising concerns. A recent CNBC survey found that approximately 69% of CEOs believe a recession is underway or imminent. In tandem, Goldman Sachs has increased its estimate of a U.S. recession’s likelihood from 35% to 45% within one week, reflecting the speed at which sentiment can shift. Source: LSEG Although the conventional definition of a recession hinges on two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth, several warning signs suggest a broader economic slowdown could already be taking shape. These include weaker consumer confidence, hiring slowdowns, and more cautious corporate spending. While none of these indicators definitively establish recessionary conditions, their combination may signal that the economy is losing momentum. A global shadow: The worldwide effect Although the U.S. economy draws the most scrutiny, the effects of current trade policies extend far beyond American borders. Several key trading partners, including China and the European Union, have implemented countermeasures, magnifying the strain on international supply networks. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has warned that escalating trade frictions may squeeze consumers further, particularly if retaliatory tariffs lead to higher prices on imported goods. A downturn in U.S. consumer spending could in turn affect industries worldwide, underscoring the risk of a broader global slowdown. In evaluating scenarios for the near future, one possibility involves a more substantial decline in equity markets, potentially in the range of the 20% drop that Larry Fink recently mentioned. Though a retrenchment of this magnitude is understandably alarming, it could be consistent with historical correction patterns observed during the late stages of an economic cycle. Should the economy weaken further, the Federal Reserve may accelerate its use of interest rate cuts to encourage lending and purchasing activity. Indeed, some forecasts suggest multiple rate reductions by 2025 to mitigate the intensity of any recessionary forces. However, these actions can also indicate a recognition that underlying economic fundamentals are required, particularly if trade tensions and market volatility persist. Source: LSEG The Aftermath: Recovery and Renewed Growth Historically, periods of recession, no matter how severe, have eventually transitioned into expansion phases. Typically, such recoveries are driven by renewed confidence, adjusted monetary and fiscal policies, and technological advances. Today, resolving at least the easing of trade conflicts remains pivotal in stabilizing business confidence and investment flows. Encouraging signs include negotiated settlements or diplomatic efforts that reduce tariffs and clarify international trading rules. According to experts, the signs are there. Traders must stay informed and flexible as the market reacts to economic signals. The volatility of the next few weeks could be challenging, but it also presents opportunities as currencies and assets fluctuate. If the dollar continues to lose its strength, it could significantly shift the global currency landscape if other economies recover before the U.S. does. At the time of writing, EURUSD is inching up as the Euro gains on the dollar. The daily chart has some upward pressure bias as prices remain above the moving average. However, prices inching toward the upper Bollinger band hints at overbought conditions. Key levels to watch on the upside are $1.1057 and $1.1148, while on the downside, the levels to watch are $1.0891 and $1.0796.

Title: Trump’s Tariff Freeze: What Could Have Happened if They Stayed in Place?

Highlights Trump's temporary freeze on reciprocal tariffs, excluding China, provided short-term market relief, prompting a 2,200-point surge in the Dow Jones. Had tariffs remained, businesses such as Walmart, Target, PepsiCo and smaller retailers anticipated significant price increases and supply chain disruptions across groceries, clothing and electronics. Economists estimated that sustained tariffs could have raised consumer prices substantially, reduced annual GDP growth by approximately 0.6% and cost the economy between $80 billion and $110 billion per year. Hate to say you read it here first, but here’s a prescient quote left on the cutting room floor from PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster’s interview with QED Investors partner Amias Gerety just two days ago: “Because this is a self-inflicted economic wound, we get an extra dollop of uncertainty. Trump could reverse all of these tomorrow.” He waited until the day after tomorrow. On Wednesday (April 9) Trump announced a temporary suspension of reciprocal tariffs for most countries, reducing rates to a universal 10%. However, tariffs on Chinese imports were escalated to a staggering 125%, citing China’s “disrespect” toward global markets. This sharp increase followed China’s retaliatory tariffs earlier in the week, intensifying trade tensions between the two countries. The pause provided temporary relief to many industries and market, as seen in the Dow Jones surge by nearly 2,200 points. However, companies and economists remain cautious about its long-term implications. The freeze does not eliminate tariffs entirely, leaving uncertainty about future trade policies but also pulling the covers on what companies may do if the temporary freeze is lifted for an appreciable amount of time. Had the tariffs remained in place, companies across various sectors were poised to pass increased costs onto consumers. Grocery chains like Morton Williams anticipated price hikes of up to 20% on imported items such as olive oil and canned tuna due to tariff impacts. Retailers like Target had already adjusted their inventory strategies earlier in the year to mitigate immediate price shocks but warned of steep increases for perishable goods like fresh produce within weeks. Similarly, manufacturers reliant on imported components faced significant challenges. PepsiCo noted declining snack sales due to inflationary pressures even before the tariff announcements. If sustained, higher tariffs could have exacerbated these trends, forcing companies to shrink product sizes (shrinkflation) or reduce offerings altogether. For smaller businesses with limited capacity to absorb costs, the effects would have been even more pronounced. Independent grocery stores and smaller manufacturers often adjust prices faster than larger corporations due to lower inventory levels. These dynamics highlight how prolonged tariffs, if they return, could disproportionately impact smaller players in the market. A PYMNTS report released earlier this week showed “about half of SMBs rely on immediate sales or existing cash for survival, with business credit cards — which are not a working capital solution — being the most common form of financing for those with access,” PYMNTS wrote recently. ”SMBs with access to some method of financing demonstrate greater confidence in navigating economic challenges.” The challenges extend to middle-market companies where — per additional PYMNTS Intelligence research — 60% of CFOs expect the tariffs to bring about additional economic uncertainty and planning challenges. The research also found that almost 70% of finance chiefs foresee supply shortages and product delays, with a similar share executing new costs to restructure their supply chains. Experts agree that if tariffs had stayed in place, consumers would have faced significant price increases across various sectors: Groceries: Yale University’s Budget Lab estimated food prices would rise by 2.8% overall, with fresh produce increasing by 4%. Lower-income households would bear the brunt of these hikes as they allocate a larger share of their income to essentials. Clothing: Apparel prices were expected to climb within three to six months due to higher costs for imported textiles and manufacturing inputs. Back-to-school shopping could have become notably more expensive. Electronics: Items like smartphones and laptops, which are heavily reliant on China-manufactured components, would likely see steep price hikes under the 125% tariff rate, which is still in place. Although it has become something of an internet meme, the exponential increases in iPhone prices if they were manufactured in the U.S. is an example. These increases would not only strain household budgets but also contribute to broader inflationary pressures. Economists warned that sustained tariffs could reduce GDP growth by 0.6% annually and cost the economy $80–110 billion per year. Wedbush Securities tech analyst Dan Ives said Tuesday in an interview with CBS News that Chinese tariffs could create a “category 5 price storm” for personal electronics and other gadgets. Taxing China and other nations at such rates is the equivalent of “flipping a boat upside down in the ocean with no life rafts,” he added. The temporary freeze has reignited debates on how tariffs should be handled moving forward. Gina Bolvin of Bolvin Wealth Management emphasized that clarity in trade policy is essential for market stability. She described the pause as a “pivotal moment” but cautioned against celebrating prematurely given ongoing uncertainties. Bolvin said the timing also “couldn’t be better” given major financial institutions including Bank of New York Mellon, BlackRock, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo report earnings on Friday. “This pause may provide companies with a clearer backdrop for their guidance, offering some relief to a market hungry for direction,” Bolvin added. John Canavan from Oxford Economics noted that unilateral tariff policies create significant risks for global commerce. He advocated for negotiated agreements rather than abrupt policy shifts that destabilize markets. “There have been very mixed messages on whether there would be negotiations,” Canavan said. “Given what’s been going on with the markets, he realized the safest thing to do is negotiate and put things on pause.” Other developments before the tariff reversal showed how companies were prepared to deal not only with increased costs but from the uncertainty of the tariff drama. New tariffs on low-value packages from China could hinder the plans of Shein and Temu. As the Financial Times (FT) reported Tuesday (April 8), the White House has upped duties on those packages to 90% of their value, or a flat fee of $75 that would increase to $150. The duty goes into effect May 2, with the flat-fee hike happening after June 1. The shift follows Trump’s closing of a loophole that allowed Chinese imports under the “de minimis” threshold of $800 to arrive duty-free. Walmart announced it was pulling its first-quarter operating income outlook due in part to tariff-related concerns. “The range of outcomes for Q1 operating income growth has widened due to less favorable category mix, higher casualty claims expense and the desire to maintain flexibility to invest in price as tariffs are implemented,” the retail giant said in a news release Wednesday. Walmart had forecast operating income of 0.5% to 2% for the first quarter when it released fourth-quarter earnings result in February. The company is scheduled to release its full earnings May 15. Walmart said it expects first-quarter sales growth to be in line with a 3% to 4% outlook, with annual sales and operating income growth guidance unchanged, per the release, timed to coincide with the company’s Investment Community Meeting. Thousands of Canadian autoworkers were furloughed before the tariffs were rolled back. Now, Canada’s largest private-sector union is warning these temporary layoffs could be the beginning of larger troubles for the sector, Bloomberg reported Wednesday. “The industry will not be able to live under these kinds of tariffs,” Unifor President Lana Payne said, per the report. “The longer this goes on, the bigger the fallout we’re going to see. My concern is that we see temporary layoffs turn into much longer layoffs.” Around 6,000 Unifor members were laid off temporarily after Trump’s April 2 announcement of tariffs on most countries, the report said. The bulk of those notices went to workers at a Stellantis plant in Windsor, Ontario, which produces Chrysler and Dodge vehicles, and which shut down for two weeks as the carmaker examines the impact of the tariffs, according to the report. Amazon reportedly canceled orders from multiple vendors in China and other Asian countries. The company’s cancellations of the orders came without warning and didn’t mention tariffs, but their timing suggests they came in response to the tariffs, Bloomberg reported Wednesday, citing unnamed sources and a document it had seen. It’s not known how widespread Amazon’s cancellations of orders are, according to the report. The report cited one vendor who said the company canceled a $500,000 order and an eCommerce consultant who said Amazon canceled orders from “several” clients. Amazon did not immediately reply to PYMNTS’ request for comments. About 40% of the products sold on the company’s website are purchased by Amazon directly from vendors, while the remainder are listed on its site by third-party sellers, according to the report.

Title: Future of Work: Intergenerational Insights & Inclusivity at WIL Day
URL: https://www.hospitalitynet.org/news/4126641.html
Time Published: 2025-04-10T07:01:00Z

There is something dynamic, inspiring, and almost… magical when you are sitting at the Women in Leadership (WIL) Day’s roundtable table; on your left, there is a senior executive of a renowned company, and on your right, another leader of the industry that you always dreamed of pursuing. Suddenly, all eyes and ears are on you as you share your perspectives of the world, and you feel HEARD. However, the table configuration has not always looked like this—with a mixture of students and industry professionals of both genders, cultures, and backgrounds, exchanging and learning from each other. In the past, not long ago, not everyone had the opportunity to speak up. The configuration has changed, and the WIL Day 2025 has proven the importance of intergenerational conversations on the future of work and inclusiveness at the workplace. WIL Day 2025 was nothing short of “inspiring, enriching, thought-provoking, and relevant”, as described by the CEO and Head of Territory for BNP Paribas Group in Switzerland, Ms. Enna Pariset, and the Chair of the Board of BlackRock Asset Management Switzerland Ltd, Dr. Mirjam Staub-Bisang. As we look toward the future of work, there is relevance in looking back into the past to see how the workplace has evolved. Based on Dr. Mirjam Staub-Bisang’s experience, in the past, earlier generations rarely involved younger voices in conversations at the management level or in the competitive landscape of employment. Today, however, the GenZ seeks not only a seat at the table but also meaningful opportunities to be heard while expecting long-term stability in their careers and purpose in their work. Enna Pariset, who manages over 1,200 people in Switzerland and hired 150 people in the past 2 years, noted the clear importance of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) topics for GenZ, with the new graduates often asking questions about company engagement during the interviews or at university graduate fairs. In the past, women fought the battles for equality to open the doors for the new generation entering the workforce. Today, we walk through those doors with our own challenges, adapting to the ever-changing environments with new technology, balancing choices and options, and, more deeply, searching for a sense of purpose and belonging everywhere. The demand for an environment of inclusiveness for all types of diversity (e.g. gender, age, cognitive and physical diversity) is growing. Hence, the need for companies to adapt to new ways of working, expectations, and giving and receiving feedback is emerging with the nonstop pace of change where tools for inclusiveness shape the workplace. But how do we figure out the type of social change that is happening and where the future of work is heading? By listening, sharing, and building a bridge between curious young leaders of GenZ and seasoned professionals who have been shaping different industries. WIL Day 2025 has been described as an embodiment of reverse mentoring, a pertinent topic that sparked great importance in today’s conversations, workplace, and life in general. There are not just more women leaders but more ages and voices that bring diverse perspectives to the table to show that it is valuable to include everyone. Ms Pariset noted the importance of DEI policies in the workplace and highlighted that BNP Paribas (Suisse) SA received the Swiss LGBTI-label in 2024 for the second consecutive year. Dr. Staub-Bisang expressed that she lacked female role models growing up. Ms Pariset has always looked up to her mother who was an accomplished lawyer. Now, they find themselves as role models for us students, which is exactly what GenZ needs in order to understand that the possibilities are endless. We are encouraged to share our perspectives and curiosity; in return, we receive inspiring stories of valuable experiences and empowerment. The logo of BNP Paribas is the bank for a changing world and Ms Pariset believes that embracing change is key to progress and success and as the CEO, she is often the one who initiates changes, saying that “this is the way the world works, the winners are those who can anticipate change”. Although change can mean uncertainty, it is the only constant in every situation. And now more than ever, we can seek guidance in the lessons learned by our role models. The WIL Initiative promotes ACTION by accompany promising individuals for growth, expanding network and opportunities for development, developing tailored solutions for companies, and creating innovative women-related projects.

By Ray Furlong April 09, 2025 Germany's Christian Democrat leader Friedrich Merz has announced that talks on forming a new coalition government have been completed, stating it would aim to take office in early May. Merz noted the coalition talks took place amid "growing international political tensions," citing Russian President Vladimir Putin's ongoing invasion of Ukraine and US tariffs. "The Russian aggressor, Putin, shows no willingness to end the war and to let the guns go silent. At the same time, economic uncertainties are growing enormously. Just this week, US government decisions have caused new turbulence," Merz said. Merz will be the new German chancellor in a coalition with the Social Democrats, led by Lars Klingbeil, who is expected to be Finance Minister. Support For Ukraine As the new government was announced, its 144-page policy plan was published, pledging strong support for Ukraine. "We will provide comprehensive support to Ukraine so that it can effectively defend itself against the Russian aggressor and assert itself in negotiations," it says. Germany's outgoing government, which is led by the Social Democrats under Chancellor Olaf Scholz, has been a key supplier of military and economic aid to Ukraine since Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022. Merz, as opposition leader, has often called on it to be faster and bolder in this. But it's not clear what this will mean in practice. During a recent visit to Berlin, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy voiced the hope that the new government would supply Taurus cruise missiles -- a longstanding request. Merz, at the time, was noncommittal. The new government is expected to significantly boost Germany's defense budget, although it's not clear by exactly how much. Even before taking office, Merz has pushed a constitutional reform through the German parliament that means strict limits on government debt no longer apply to defense spending. "Our security is currently more endangered than at any time since the end of the Cold War. The greatest and most direct threat comes from Russia," says the new coalition's policy document. It adds that "Putin's pursuit of power threatens the rules-based international order." Trump Tariffs There's no mention of the US president in the document. But when Merz was asked about US ties by a foreign journalist, he switched briefly to English to say, "The message to Donald Trump is: Germany is back on track, Germany will fulfil the obligations in terms of defense." Asked about US tariffs, Merz said Europe should seek a joint response. His words came hours after EU countries agreed a range of countermeasures, including staggered tariffs on selected imports from the United States beginning on April 15. Merz is a lifelong transatlantacist who also spent four years working for the US investment company BlackRock. After his election victory in February, amid a tense start in ties between Europe and the new US administration, he said Europe must secure "independence" from Washington in terms of defense. Still, the coalition agreement says the relationship with Washington is of "paramount importance." "In trade policy, we seek close cooperation with all of North America. The trans-Atlantic economic area offers the best conditions for success in global competition," it states. Iran's Nuclear Program The document also reaffirms Germany's commitment to working with Washington and other Western partners to end Iran's nuclear program. "We support international sanctions against the Iranian regime and will push for the Revolutionary Guards to be put on the EU list of terror organizations," it says. The new government's domestic priorities include promises to boost growth via economic reforms and to crackdown on illegal immigration. The new coalition needs to be approved by Social Democrat party members and the senior leadership of the Christian Democrats, before a confidence vote in parliament.

Global Times Economic coercion and blackmail underscores Washington's hegemonic mindset: expert By Ma Jingjing Published: Apr 09, 2025 12:23 AM Chinese Foreign Ministry and Commerce Ministry on Tuesday vowed to take countermeasures to safeguard rights and interests, in response to US President Donald Trump's recent claims of escalating tariffs unless China withdrew its retaliatory tariffs against the US by April 8. In a post on Truth Social on Monday, the US president has threatened China with an extra 50 percent tariff on goods imported into the US if China does not withdraw its 34 percent counter-tariff on US products, according to CNBC. "We will not let anyone take away the Chinese people's legitimate right to development. We will not tolerate any attempt to harm China's sovereignty, security and development interests. We will continue to take resolute and strong measures to safeguard our legitimate rights and interests," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said in response at the regular Foreign Ministry press conference on Tuesday. Lin said that judging from its actions, the US doesn't seem to be serious about having talks right now. "If the US truly wants to talk, it should let people see that they're ready to treat others with equality, respect and mutual benefit. If the US decides not to care about the interests of the US itself, China and the rest of the world, and is determined to fight a tariff and trade war, China's response will continue to the end," Lin said. In a statement published on its website on Tuesday, China's Commerce Ministry said China will resolutely take countermeasures to safeguard its rights and interests should the US escalate its tariff measures. Citing sources or experts, Niutanqin, one of the self-media accounts, posted on Tuesday that China could take six possible measures against the US' tariffs, including significantly increasing tariffs on US agricultural products such as soybeans and sorghum, banning US poultry imports, suspending China-US cooperation on fentanyl-related issues, imposing curbs on services trade with the US, reducing or banning the import of US films, and investigating the intellectual property benefits of US companies operating in China. China will continue to take resolute measures to safeguard its legitimate and lawful rights and interests, Lin said on Tuesday, noting that the ministry does not comment on what's been said on the internet. Escalated pressure While showing no intention to pause the sweeping "reciprocal tariffs," Trump continues to intensify pressure on its trade partners including China, the EU, Japan and Canada. "The European Union's been very bad to us," Trump told reporters at the White House, accusing European nations of not buying enough US goods. "They're going to have to buy their energy from us, because they need it and they're going to have to buy it from us. They can buy it, we can knock off $350 billion in one week," Reuters reported, citing the US president. On Monday evening, the European Commission proposed its first retaliatory tariffs at 25 percent on a range of US imports in response to Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs, Reuters reported, citing an internal document. The tariffs on some goods will take effect on May 16 and others later in the year, on December 1, the document said, Reuters reported. In addition, Trump wrote in another post on Truth Social on Monday that Japan has "treated the US very poorly on Trade. They don't take our cars, but we take MILLIONS of theirs." The US Department of Commerce, as part of an annual review process, plans to hike duties on Canadian lumber from 14.4 percent to 34.45 percent, CNN reported on Monday, citing published and unpublished filings in the Federal Register. "The economic coercion and blackmail underscores Washington's hegemonic mindset - seeking 'America First' and 'American exceptionalism' by forcing others to make sacrifices," He Weiwen, a senior fellow at the Center for China and Globalization, told the Global Times on Tuesday. The US' unilateral and protectionist behaviors run counter to the WTO's multilateral trading rules as well as other countries' legitimate rights and interests, He said, stressing that China's resolute countermeasures against US bullying are necessary to safeguard true multilateralism and maintain the multilateral trading system. Self-inflicted isolation "By imposing high tariffs on all of its trade partners, including China, the US risks trade and economic isolation," Yu Miaojie, president of Liaoning University, told the Global Times on Tuesday. In the short term, global trade may be adversely affected and global growth may be dragged down. However, the US' tariffs will have limited impact on China's exports, given that the country has made efforts to diversify export destinations over the past several years and form a new pattern of all-round opening-up in various fields and sectors, Yu said. "Instead, US tariffs will lead to higher prices, adding to inflationary pressure while slowing US economic growth," he said. Larry Fink, CEO of US multinational investment firm BlackRock, said US stock markets could fall another 20 percent as steep US tariffs will lead some investors to believe the US economy may already be contracting, Reuters reported. "Most CEOs I talk to would say we are probably in a recession right now," Fink told the Economic Club of New York on Monday, Reuters said. Ken Langone, co-founder of US home improvement specialty retailer Home Depot, blasted the tariffs, describing the 34 percent tariff rate on China as "too aggressive, too soon," the Financial Times reported. "I believe he's been poorly advised by his advisers about this trade situation - and the formula they're applying," said Langone The US Chamber of Commerce, which represents millions of US businesses big and small but which is heavily funded by industry titans, is considering suing the Trump administration to block the implementation of Trump's new tariffs set to go into effect Wednesday, Fortune reported on Tuesday, citing sources with direct knowledge of the discussions. The US Chamber could argue that Trump's invocation of emergency powers to impose the new tariffs is illegal. Last week a nonprofit called New Civil Liberties Alliance took a similar approach, filing suit on behalf of a small business owner who imports goods from China, arguing that the US President did not have the legal authority to impose his February tariffs on China, according to the report. "Faced with the US' bullying practices, all other economies will have to figure out how to overcome challenges. Thus, those economies should unite, and continue to promote bilateral and multilateral cooperation," Chen Fengying, a research fellow at the Beijing-based China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, told the Global Times on Tuesday. China's Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) hosted a roundtable meeting with US-funded companies on Sunday, reaffirming the country's commitment to reform and opening-up amid global trade tensions, according to a statement on the MOFCOM website on Monday. Regardless of global uncertainties, China remains resolute in its path toward reform and opening-up, Ling Ji, vice minister of commerce and deputy China international trade representative, said at the meeting, noting that multilateralism is the inevitable solution to the challenges facing the world and that China's door to the outside world will only open wider.

Title: BTC
URL: https://erickimphotography.com/blog/2025/04/10/btc/
Time Published: 2025-04-10T05:59:47Z
Full Content:
As of April 10, 2025, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at approximately $82,107 USD. The recent surge in Bitcoin’s price is attributed to President Trump’s announcement on April 9, 2025, of a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs, which led to a broad market rally benefiting digital currencies and crypto-related stocks. Despite this uptick, Bitcoin remains about 24.68% below its all-time high of $109,225 reached in January 2025. The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, and external factors such as geopolitical events and regulatory changes can significantly impact prices. Investors should exercise caution and conduct thorough research before making investment decisions. … Key Points Current Price As of recent checks, Bitcoin’s price is approximately $81,975 USD, but given its volatility, this may have changed. For the latest price, you can check Coinbase or CoinMarketCap. What is Bitcoin? Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency, meaning it operates without a central bank or authority. It uses blockchain technology, a public ledger, to record transactions securely and transparently. Created in 2008 by an anonymous entity known as Satoshi Nakamoto, it began use in 2009 and is often seen as an investment, though some countries, like El Salvador, have adopted it as legal tender. Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of Bitcoin (BTC) This section provides a comprehensive overview of Bitcoin (BTC), addressing the user’s query with detailed insights derived from recent data and analysis. The focus is on the current price, a description of Bitcoin, and additional context to ensure a thorough understanding. Introduction to Bitcoin Bitcoin, abbreviated as BTC, is the first decentralized cryptocurrency, introduced in 2008 by an unknown entity using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. It began operational use in 2009 with the release of its open-source implementation. The currency is based on a free-market ideology and operates on a peer-to-peer network, utilizing blockchain technology to record transactions. This decentralized nature means it functions without central oversight, relying on nodes (computers) that maintain a public distributed ledger. Transactions are validated through cryptography, making it secure and resistant to fraud, provided users protect sensitive data. Bitcoin has been adopted as legal tender in El Salvador since 2021, marking a significant milestone in its acceptance. However, it is primarily viewed as an investment, with some scholars describing it as an economic bubble due to its volatility. Its pseudonymous nature has also attracted regulatory scrutiny, leading to bans in several countries by 2021 due to concerns over criminal use. Current Price Analysis The current price of Bitcoin, as of recent data gathered on April 9, 2025, at around 10:59 PM PDT, is approximately $81,975 USD. This figure is derived from multiple sources to ensure accuracy, given Bitcoin’s high volatility. Specifically: These prices were checked across different platforms to account for potential discrepancies, which can arise due to the dynamic nature of cryptocurrency markets. The slight variations ($81,640.27 to $82,031) reflect real-time market fluctuations, and the chosen figure of $81,975 USD represents a reasonable average based on the most recent data. Given the time of checking (late evening on April 9, 2025), and the rapid changes in crypto prices, users are advised to verify the latest price on platforms like Coinbase for real-time updates. Market Context and Recent Developments Bitcoin’s price has been subject to significant volatility, influenced by global economic events. Recent news highlights include: These events underscore Bitcoin’s sensitivity to macroeconomic factors and regulatory news, contributing to its price swings. The circulating supply is approximately 19,849,081 BTC, with a maximum supply capped at 21,000,000 BTC, which is expected to be fully mined by around 2140, affecting long-term scarcity and value. Additional Metrics and Technical Details To provide a fuller picture, here are some additional metrics from recent data: These figures, particularly from CoinMarketCap, illustrate Bitcoin’s market size and trading activity, which are crucial for investors. The all-time high of $109,114.88, reached earlier in 2025, shows the potential for significant gains, while the all-time low reflects its early days. Regulatory and Social Context Bitcoin’s adoption has been controversial. While El Salvador’s adoption as legal tender in 2021 is notable, other countries have banned it due to concerns over its use in criminal activities, given its pseudonymous nature. This regulatory landscape adds complexity to its market dynamics, with ongoing debates about its role as a currency versus an investment asset. Recent news also mentions potential U.S. crypto regulations and European financial stability concerns, highlighting the interplay between crypto and traditional finance. Conclusion In summary, Bitcoin (BTC) is a pioneering decentralized cryptocurrency with a current price of approximately $81,975 USD, subject to rapid changes. It operates on blockchain technology, offering secure, peer-to-peer transactions without central authority. Its market is volatile, influenced by global events and regulatory developments, and it remains a significant topic in both investment and regulatory discussions.

Title: Pentagon chief says US could 'revive' Panama bases

During a visit to Panama, Hegseth suggested that "by invitation" the United States could "revive" military bases or naval air stations and rotate deployments of US troops to an isthmus the United States invaded 35 years ago. He also said his country was seeking free passage through the canal for its Navy ships -- which US President Donald Trump had said were "severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any way, shape or form." Since coming to power in January, Trump has repeatedly claimed that China has too much influence over the canal, which handles about 40 percent of US container traffic and five percent of world trade. His administration has vowed to "take back" control of the interoceanic waterway that the United States funded, built and controlled until 1999. Hegseth on Wednesday suggested the slew of former US military bases that dot Panama could again be used to host US troops. He said a deal signed with Panama this week was an "opportunity to revive, whether it's the military base, naval air station, locations where US troops can work with Panamanian troops to enhance capabilities and cooperate in a rotational way." Hegseth cited the possibility of "joint exercises" but the mention of a "rotational" force is likely to raise the hackles of Panamanians, for whom sole ownership of the canal is a source of intense national pride. The US has long participated in military exercises in Panama. But a longer-term rotational force -- like the one the US maintains in Darwin, Australia -- is politically toxic for Panama's center-right leader Jose Raul Mulino. His government quickly slapped down the idea. "Panama made clear, through President (Jose Raul) Mulino that we cannot accept military bases or defense sites," said Panama security minister Frank Abrego in a joint public appearance with Hegseth. - Perceived threat - Hegseth also said the United States was seeking an agreement under which its warships could pass through the canal "first, and free." Jose Ramon Icaza, Panama's Minister for Canal Affairs, said "we will seek a mechanism by which warships and auxiliary ships can have a compensation system for services, that is, a way to make them cost-neutral" but not "free." The Pentagon chief's two-day visit has been peppered with comments about China and its influence in Latin America. He stated that the United States is not looking for war with China, but will counter Beijing's "threats" to the region. "We do not seek war with China. And war with China is certainly not inevitable. We do not seek it in any form," the secretary said. "But together, we must prevent war by robustly and vigorously deterring China's threats in this hemisphere," the former Fox News anchor said in a speech. The canal is run by an independent Panamanian authority and is legally bound to be open to all nations. But Trump has zeroed in on the role of a Hong Kong company that has for decades operated ports at either end of the canal linking the Atlantic and Pacific. Hegseth asserted that China-based companies are also capturing Latin American land and infrastructure in strategic sectors like energy and telecommunications, and that China has too large a military presence in the hemisphere. "Make no mistake, Beijing is investing and operating in this region for military advantage and unfair economic gain," Hegseth said. Under pressure from the White House, Panama has accused Hong Kong-backed Panama Ports Company of failing to meet its contractual obligations and pushed for the firm to pull out of the country. On Wednesday the firm rejected an audit that said it had failed to pay $1.2 billion due under its concession. The ports' parent company CK Hutchison last month announced a deal to offload 43 ports in 23 countries -- including its two on the Panama Canal -- to a consortium led by US asset manager BlackRock for $19 billion in cash. A furious Beijing has since announced an antitrust review of the deal. The United States invaded Panama in 1989 to oust dictator Manuel Noriega, killing more than 500 Panamanians and razing parts of the capital. mis-arb/md/tgb BLACKROCK Related Links Naval Warfare in the 21st Century He also said his country was seeking free passage through the canal for its Navy ships -- which US President Donald Trump had said were "severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any way, shape or form."

"Make no mistake, Beijing is investing and operating in this region for military advantage and unfair economic gain," Hegseth said. Under pressure from the White House, Panama has accused Hong Kong-backed Panama Ports Company of failing to meet its contractual obligations and pushed for the firm to pull out of the country. On Wednesday the firm rejected an audit that said it had failed to pay $1.2 billion due under its concession. The ports' parent company CK Hutchison last month announced a deal to offload 43 ports in 23 countries -- including its two on the Panama Canal -- to a consortium led by US asset manager BlackRock for $19 billion in cash. A furious Beijing has since announced an antitrust review of the deal. The United States invaded Panama in 1989 to oust dictator Manuel Noriega, killing more than 500 Panamanians and razing parts of the capital. mis-arb/md/tgb BLACKROCK Related Links Naval Warfare in the 21st Century Since coming to power in January, Trump has repeatedly claimed that China has too much influence over the canal, which handles about 40 percent of US container traffic and five percent of world trade. His administration has vowed to "take back" control of the interoceanic waterway that the United States funded, built and controlled until 1999. Hegseth on Wednesday suggested the slew of former US military bases that dot Panama could again be used to host US troops. He said a deal signed with Panama this week was an "opportunity to revive, whether it's the military base, naval air station, locations where US troops can work with Panamanian troops to enhance capabilities and cooperate in a rotational way." Hegseth cited the possibility of "joint exercises" but the mention of a "rotational" force is likely to raise the hackles of Panamanians, for whom sole ownership of the canal is a source of intense national pride. The US has long participated in military exercises in Panama. But a longer-term rotational force -- like the one the US maintains in Darwin, Australia -- is politically toxic for Panama's center-right leader Jose Raul Mulino. His government quickly slapped down the idea. "Panama made clear, through President (Jose Raul) Mulino that we cannot accept military bases or defense sites," said Panama security minister Frank Abrego in a joint public appearance with Hegseth. - Perceived threat - Hegseth also said the United States was seeking an agreement under which its warships could pass through the canal "first, and free." Jose Ramon Icaza, Panama's Minister for Canal Affairs, said "we will seek a mechanism by which warships and auxiliary ships can have a compensation system for services, that is, a way to make them cost-neutral" but not "free." The Pentagon chief's two-day visit has been peppered with comments about China and its influence in Latin America. He stated that the United States is not looking for war with China, but will counter Beijing's "threats" to the region. "We do not seek war with China. And war with China is certainly not inevitable. We do not seek it in any form," the secretary said. "But together, we must prevent war by robustly and vigorously deterring China's threats in this hemisphere," the former Fox News anchor said in a speech.

Title: Hegseth says China's military presence in Western Hemisphere is 'too large'

U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has again put China at the center of U.S. priorities in the Western Hemisphere, one day after calling the world power a threat to the Panama Canal PANAMA CITY -- U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth focused again on China's presence in the Western Hemisphere Wednesday, one day after calling the world power a threat to the Panama Canal. Speaking at a regional security conference, Hegseth said that China-based companies were controlling land and critical infrastructure in strategic sectors. “China’s military has too large of a presence in the Western Hemisphere,” Hegseth said. “Make no mistake, Beijing is investing and operating in this region for military advantage and unfair economic gain.” He called on the region’s governments to work together to deter China and address threats posed by transnational drug cartels and mass immigration. Hegseth was speaking a day after meeting Panama's President José Raúl Mulino and touring the Panama Canal. The two countries agreed to step up security coordination and appeared to say they would work toward a way to pay back fees that U.S. warships pay to pass through the Panama Canal. The visit comes amid tensions over U.S. President Donald Trump’s repeated assertions that the U.S. is being overcharged to use the Panama Canal and that China has influence over its operations — allegations that Panama has denied. Shortly after Hegseth and Mulino met, the Chinese Embassy in Panama criticized the U.S. government in a statement on X, saying Washington had used “blackmail” to further its own interests and that who Panama carries out business with is a “sovereign decision of Panama ... and something the U.S. doesn’t have the right to interfere in.” On Wednesday, Hegseth said, “I don’t know anything about blackmail." The concern about China's influence over the waterway was provoked by Hong Kong-based consortium CK Hutchison holding a 25-year lease on ports at either end of the canal. The Panamanian government announced that the lease was being audited and late Monday concluded that there were irregularities, which CK Hutchison denied in a statement Wednesday. CK Hutchison has already announced that it would be selling its controlling stake in the ports to a consortium including BlackRock Inc., effectively putting the ports under American control once the sale is complete. Later Wednesday, Hegseth said that he would sign an agreement with Panama concerning the security and operation of the Panama Canal that would allow U.S. warships to “sail first and free.” The fact that the U.S. has a treaty obligation to protect the canal, but also had to pay to move its warships between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans had been one of the Trump administration’s complaints. Panama's Canal Affairs Minister José Ramón Icaza, said the two governments would look for a mechanism to repay the fees from U.S. warships to use the canal. He said annually they had paid on average $5 million to $7 million. The canal generated about $2.4 billion for the government in the last fiscal year, he said. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: XRP ETF Launch Impresses Even In Bear Market, Says Analyst

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Teucrium’s newly launched 2x XRP ETF on the New York Stocks Exchange recorded $5.43 million in turnover during its first day of trading on April 8, despite XRP prices hitting a five-month low. The ETF, trading under the ticker XXRP, achieved this milestone as cryptocurrency markets faced widespread selling pressure. Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas called the performance “very respectable” given the current bearish market conditions. According to market data, XRP’s price dropped to $1.61 on Monday, marking its lowest point in five months. The price briefly recovered to over $1.87 on Tuesday before falling again to $1.69 by evening. Even with these unstable price movements, Teucrium moved forward with its ETF launch, aiming to give investors a way to profit from price swings in either direction. $XXRP (2x XRP ETF) saw $5mil in volume on Day One, very respectable, esp considering the mkt conditions. That puts it in approx top 5% of new ETF launches, and about 4x what the 2x Solana ETF $SOLT did (altho both 200x less than King IBIT). pic.twitter.com/u3QQq5yuHv — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) April 8, 2025 Based on reports from Bloomberg’s Balchunas, the XXRP ETF’s first-day trading volume was about four times higher than what Solana’s similar 2x ETF saw on its launch day. This performance puts Teucrium’s product in the top 5% of all new ETF launches. However, the $5.43 million figure still pales in comparison to BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF debut, which saw trading volume roughly 200 times larger. The altcoin community has responded positively to the ETF launch, especially considering the harsh market conditions. Data shows that 137,000 traders faced liquidations in the 24 hours surrounding the launch, with total losses exceeding $413 million across cryptocurrency markets. Some XRP supporters have suggested that while XXRP’s volume was much smaller than BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF (IBIT), a potential spot ETF (which some have dubbed “IXRP”) could provide stronger competition. Unlike spot ETFs that directly hold the underlying asset, Teucrium’s XXRP does not invest directly in XRP tokens. Instead, it’s designed to deliver twice the daily performance of XRP’s price movements, which amplifies both gains and losses for investors. Community figure Crypto Eri warned about the ETF’s built-in risk factors, noting that even if XRP’s price stays flat, volatility alone could cause significant losses. For example, if XRP experiences 25% volatility, XXRP holders could see a 6% loss. With 70% volatility, those losses could balloon to 40%. The launch comes as more than 10 asset managers have filed applications with the SEC for spot XRP ETFs. Major firms like Grayscale and Franklin Templeton have submitted applications, though BlackRock has not yet expressed interest in launching an XRP-specific ETF product.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Atkins will succeed former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who, under the Biden administration, attracted the ire of crypto leaders by suing or investigating almost every major company in the industry for alleged violations of securities laws. The incoming SEC chair is all but certain to have a far different approach to crypto. Atkins, who previously served as an SEC commissioner under President George W. Bush, recently told senators that a top concern of his chairmanship will be providing “a firm regulatory foundation for digital assets through a rational, coherent, and principled approach.” Atkins himself holds up to a $5 million stake in a crypto investment firm where he serves as a limited partner. Until February, he held between $250,000 and $500,000 in equity in the crypto custodian Anchorage Digital, and the same amount in call options in Securitize, a BlackRock-backed blockchain firm where he also held a board seat, according to ethics disclosures. In Atkins’ absence, the SEC has barrelled ahead with pro-crypto policies. The agency’s two Republican commissioners—Acting Chair Mark Uyeda and Commissioner Hester Peirce—have moved to dismiss almost every major lawsuit against a crypto company. They’ve also issued statements effectively exempting meme coins, crypto mining, and stablecoins from securities regulation. The SEC is currently operating with just three commissioners—Uyeda, Peirce, and Democratic commissioner Caroline Crenshaw—as opposed to the full five. Crenshaw supported former chair Gensler’s crypto lawsuits during the Biden administration, and her nomination to the SEC was so intensely protested by the industry in December that Senate Democrats abandoned a push to renominate her. The SEC’s rules state that no more than three commissioners from the same political party can serve at the same time to “ensure that the Commission remains non-partisan.” Thus, Trump would ordinarily appoint two Democrats to fill empty seats at the agency. But the president has recently shown an unorthodox resistance to such long-held Washington norms. Last month, he fired two Democrats serving on the Federal Trade Commission and a Democrat on the National Labor Relations Board. Until now, a key 1930s Supreme Court ruling has protected commissioners on such independent agencies—the SEC included—from being fired without cause. Experts believe Trump could be angling to have that long-standing precedent overturned by the Supreme Court’s current conservative majority. Lawsuits on the subject have already been filed.

Filings on Wednesday show that the regulator approved trading options for BlackRock's iShares Ethereum Trust, along with the Bitwise Ethereum ETF and Grayscale's Ethereum Trust and Ethereum Mini Trust. The Ethereum ETFs allow investors to gain exposure to digital assets without the need to buy and store the virtual coin themselves. Options give investors the right to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price by a set date. Crypto options are popular because they allow investors to gain exposure to the performance of an asset, rather than just investing in it. Traders are able to bet on the future price of a digital coin, and the market for doing so is much bigger than the spot one. Options trading on ETFs adds more liquidity to the crypto investment space, experts previously told Decrypt. The regulator last year approved Ethereum ETFs just months after giving their Bitcoin counterparts the green light. The SEC also approved options trading on the Bitcoin funds. Cryptocurrency ETFs—managed by the likes of BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale—give investors from top hedge funds to retail investors the ability to invest in the cryptocurrency in an easy and regulated way. Though the Bitcoin funds have received enormous inflows, pushing the price of the biggest cryptocurrency by market cap to new highs, the Ethereum funds haven't drawn the same kind of demand. A number of top asset managers are now hoping to get approval from the regulator to list other ETFs giving investors exposure to altcoins like Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin. CoinGecko data shows that Ethereum is now trading for $1,675 per coin after surging by more than 14% over the last 24 hours. It's one of the biggest gainers on the day amid a markets upswing triggered by President Trump's decision to pause "reciprocal" trade tariffs on most nations.

The first batch of approvals allow ETHA and FETH to offer up to 25,000 options contracts. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved proposals from Nasdaq and Cboe to list and trade options on spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) managed by BlackRock and Fidelity, according to April 9 filings. The orders were granted for the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) and the Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH) following a review process that included amendments, public comments, and regulatory justification for new product listings under Section 19(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Both filings approved options with American-style exercise and physical settlement. The approved contracts will adhere to existing listing rules applicable to ETF options, including margin, strike intervals, series expiration cycles, and minimum trading increments. The ETHA and FETH options will be subject to a 25,000-contract position and exercise limit per market side, just as the options for Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs were approved last year. Nasdaq and Cboe emphasized the conservative nature of the 25,000-contract cap, which was derived from a comparative analysis with other ETFs and commodity-based trusts. Additionally, Nasdaq noted that the notional risk of a maximum position in ETHA would represent less than 0.03% of the Ethereum market’s capitalization and below 4.4% of the trust’s outstanding shares. Cboe compared the proposed limits to those set for Bitcoin-based ETFs and similarly structured commodity products. The approvals follow a precedent set for spot Bitcoin ETF options, which received SEC authorization on Sept. 23, 2024, and began trading in November 2024. As happened last year, options trading requirements from other issuers are likely to be approved, with trading starting in the same week as ETHA and FETH.

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. Bitcoin and crypto prices have been rocked by U.S. president Donald Trump’s chaotic global trade war—forcing Michael Saylor’s Strategy into a shock bitcoin “sell” warning. Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has bounced back over $80,000 per bitcoin, though well down from a January peak of almost $110,000 that’s seen $1.3 trillion wiped from the price of ethereum, XRP and the combined crypto market as fears of a looming “crisis scenario” swirl. Now, after Treasury secretary Scott Bessent issues a surprise bitcoin prediction, the BlackRock-powered, crypto-based tokenisation of assets has been forecast to grow "exponentially” from $600 billion to $19 trillion by 2033.

More pushing the bitcoin price and wide crypto market including ethereum and XRP higher. “For financial institutions, tokenisation is no longer a side project. It is increasingly emerging as a strategic path and a likely next step in the evolution of finance,” the report, written by analysts with XRP developer Ripple and global management consulting company Boston Consulting Group and titled “Approaching the tokenisation tipping point," read. Wall Street giants, led by the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock, have embraced tokenisation in recent years. "Global adoption is poised to grow exponentially," Yue Hong Zhang, managing director and partner at BCG Hong Kong, wrote in the report. “With the recent growth of real-world assets, people outside the crypto industry are increasingly asking about the potential of tokenised assets to address historically under-penetrated segments."

More Wall Street giants—lifting ethereum, XRP and other major cryptocurrencies. BlackRock, which manages over $10 trillion globally on behalf of clients, led the campaign last year to bring a fully-fledged spot bitcoin ETF to the U.S., winning approval for its IBIT and a fleet of other spot bitcoin ETFs in January. In July, BlackRock's chief executive Larry Fink said he had been "wrong" about bitcoin when he'd previously dismissed it as "an index of money laundering," admitting bitcoin is "digital gold” and a "legitimate" financial instrument. The arrival of a fleet of spot bitcoin ETFs on Wall Street was the first step in what Fink branded a digital "revolution" when he revealed his crypto ambitions for BlackRock in 2023—which includes a radical new, blockchain-based alternative to the U.S. dollar. Fink said he believes the crypto-based tokenisation of assets on blockchains will revolutionize Wall Street, as everything—from stock markets, pre-IPO stocks, hedge funds, infrastructure projects, commodities, alternate investment instruments and private credit—becomes tokenised. "At BlackRock, we believe that tokenisation has the potential to drive a significant transformation in capital markets infrastructure," BlackRock’s global head of strategic ecosystem partnerships Joseph Chalom told Fortune last year.
