Title: Ethereum Is Becoming TradFi’s Settlement Layer — Here’s Why

Ethereum is quietly transforming from a hub of speculative activity into the foundational settlement layer for traditional finance (TradFi). With its secure infrastructure, growing regulatory alignment, and network effects, ETH is proving it can securely and efficiently handle large-scale institutional settlements. In an X post, crypto trader MoonKing recently highlighted a significant trend in the financial world, stating that Ethereum is becoming the settlement layer for traditional finance (TradFi). Since January, the tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) on Ethereum have surged 20-fold, and the momentum shows no signs of slowing down. The capital flows that were once confined to testnets and pilots are now moving decisively into production-level deployments on the ETH mainnet. This transition is supported by real yield and a growing regulatory traction, which together are driving greater institutional confidence. The leading institutions, like BlackRock, Plume, Ondo Finance, Superstate, and Franklin Templeton, are building with a clear intent to reshape financial infrastructure by leveraging blockchain. Their focus is not just on speculative crypto trading but on bringing US treasuries, credit products, and other yield-bearing assets directly into on-chain. This strategic movement signals a paradigm shift, as traditional finance is integrating with decentralized platforms to enhance efficiency, transparency, and accessibility. With ETF momentum building, stablecoin adoption is surging, and now a wave of real-world asset (RWA) inflows is accelerating, ETH is rapidly cementing its role as core financial infrastructure, which has become harder to ignore. This convergence of on-chain finance and legacy systems marks a critical inflection point where ETH is evolving into a foundational layer for global capital markets. BlackRock’s appetite for Ethereum keeps growing. According to Ucan_Coin revealed on X, the asset management giant has continued its accumulation through the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA). BlackRock now holds 2.8 million ETH, worth around $10.5 billion. In the past week, BlackRock added another $440 million to its ETH holdings, which marks one of the largest single-week institutional inflows to date. ETH has experienced a brief pullback earlier in the week but has impressively reclaimed the $3,700 to $3,800 range, which has served as a key battleground for momentum over recent weeks. The altcoin market cap continues to hold firmly above the $1.25 trillion mark, a critical psychological and technical threshold that is reinforcing bullish sentiment across the broader crypto space. The institutional inflow led by giants like BlackRock has continued to fuel confidence, and the crypto market is gaining a firmer foothold in mainstream finance.

Title: BlackRock CIO Warns US Must Issue ‘A Lot of Debt,’ Names One Factor That Could Trigger Stock Market Correction
URL: https://dailyhodl.com/2025/07/28/blackrock-cio-warns-us-must-issue-a-lot-of-debt-names-one-factor-that-could-trigger-stock-market-correction/

A top BlackRock insider says that the stock market could face a correction in the near future if inflation takes off. In a new interview on Bloomberg, Rick Rieder, BlackRock’s chief investment officer of global fixed income, says that the US government’s fiscal situation requires it to issue “a lot” more debt. Rieder says large debt issuance makes it harder to allow longer-term yields to go up, making it more difficult to invest in T-Bills with durations longer than 10 years. And if inflation picks up, Rieder says long bonds could get hit even harder along with equities. “We’re going to issue a lot of debt. The long end is a hard place to invest. It used to be that the long end protected you against the equity market. If inflation ends up being higher, which I don’t necessarily anticipate, then what’ll happen is equities and the long end will get hit. So the long end of the yield curve today, given that you can get so much yield – if you’re an investor on the front end – the long end doesn’t become that attractive.” Looking forward, Rieder says that the US can only maintain its debt burden if it somehow manages to spur a higher GDP than the amount of debt it takes on, perhaps with the productivity expected to come from the growth of artificial intelligence (AI). “There’s only one way to de-lever the economy. You’ve got to outrun the debt, you’ve got to outgrow it. So there is a plausible outcome where you get nominal GDP running at 4.5-5% if you get that interest rate down to 3%. Gosh, now you can start to de-lever but it takes a really long period of time. Listen, I think the one engine today, since we are going to have a bigger debt burden, and not only are we going to have a bigger debt burden, you have to fund it domestically, because internationalism doesn’t buy as much. As long as we grow, then you can work through it.” Follow us on X, Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Join the leading maritime news network An aerial view shows the Balboa Port, operated by Panama Ports Company, as U.S. President Donald Trump plans to regain control of the Canal, in Panama City, Panama, February 1, 2025. REUTERS/Enea Lebrun (Bloomberg) — CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. said it may invite a “major strategic investor” from China to join a group seeking to buy its global ports, as the Hong Kong-based company works toward a solution that pleases all in the geopolitically-sensitive deal. The unnamed investor would join as a significant member of the consortium, the company said in a stock exchange filing Monday, hours after the expiry of a 145-day exclusive talks window with the group backed by American asset manager BlackRock Inc. “Changes to the membership of the consortium and the structure of the transaction will be needed for the transaction to be capable of being approved by all relevant authorities,” CK Hutchison said, adding that it “intends to allow such time as is required for such discussions.” State-owned China Cosco Shipping Corp. was negotiating a powerful role for itself as a condition to join the consortium, Bloomberg News reported last week. Shares of Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing’s firm oscillated between gains and losses after the announcement. The stock closed 0.84% lower in Hong Kong on Monday. Cosco Shipping Holdings Co., the listed unit of China Cosco, was down 2.9%. Monday’s confirmation about a Chinese investor will likely help remove the obstacles that have been holding back the deal. Beijing has so far viewed the sale of CK Hutchison’s 43 ports as a threat to its interests because it includes transfer of two ports along the strategically important Panama Canal to the group backed by BlackRock — which China considers a proxy for American influence. Chinese authorities separately warned the parties involved not to bypass antitrust reviews, so as to prevent them from rushing into a deal. CK Hutchison reiterated its position Monday that it “will not proceed with any transaction that does not have the approval of all relevant authorities.” CK Hutchison’s shares, which shot up 37% in the days following the sale announcement on March 4, saw political pressure wipe out all the gains in the space of a month. The stock started rallying again last month as investors flocked back after China Cosco came into play. While it may initially sound like positive news, restricting the group to a few potentially strategic buyers means limited competition in the price discovery process for the asset, according to Ke Yan, head of research at DZT Research in Singapore. “Hence, the deal may not fetch the best price that the company hopes for,” he said. Investors have in recent weeks flocked back to CK Hutchison amid optimism that the 96-year-old Li will seal the deal of his lifetime. If it goes through, the sale will net the group more than $19 billion in cash. The renewed optimism is largely due to China Cosco’s interest in playing a role in the buying consortium, alongside BlackRock and Italian billionaire Gianluigi Aponte’s Terminal Investment Ltd. “Ongoing negotiations and the reported inclusion of Cosco Shipping in the consortium have likely eased concerns over Chinese regulatory hurdles, strengthening investor confidence in the deal’s viability,” according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Denise Wong. Initially hailed as a smart move by Li to exit a business caught up in global trade tensions, the deal quickly drew the ire of Beijing. It didn’t help that President Donald Trump billed the transaction as the return of Panama Canal back to American influence. Challenges remain even as Cosco enters the discussions, David Blennerhassett, an analyst at Quiddity Advisors, wrote on financial analysis platform SmartKarma. That could reverse the current rhetoric and upset Trump, who has a handful of issues already on his plate, he said. CK Hutchison’s share price could also be under pressure should talks on the sale drag on, he added. Even with an extended timeline, revised terms or a partial agreement, uncertainty around the deal’s value and timing would increase, said Bloomberg Intelligence’s Wong. The delay may also fuel concerns about regulatory and policy challenges, she said. Investors will be watching out for more answers to questions surrounding the deal, including what role the Chinese side will play in the consortium, said Gary Ng, a senior economist at Natixis. The controversial deal has also weighed on Li and his family’s other businesses. Younger son Richard’s talks to expand his insurance business into mainland China have stalled after the ports deal upset Beijing, Bloomberg reported earlier this month. That followed another Bloomberg report in March that China told its state-owned firms to hold off on any new collaboration with businesses linked to the Li family. The original structure of the buyer consortium was designed to give the Aponte family-controlled Terminal Investment ownership of all the ports except the two in Panama, whose control will go to BlackRock’s Global Infrastructure Partners unit. © 2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Most prominent among them was Golden Cygnet, a spectacular winner of the Supreme Novices Hurdle in 1978, who looked to have the racing world at his feet only to sustain fatal injuries in a fall just weeks later. O’Grady started training in 1972 and saddled his first winner, Vibrax, at Gowran Park in January of that year. He took over the license from his father Willie, who had just died. It meant O’Grady, who attended school at Blackrock College in Dublin, had to leave university without finishing a veterinary degree. He was in the spotlight due to the famous Gay Future controversy in 1974 when the horse of that name was at the centre of a gambling coup by an Irish betting syndicate. O’Grady was later played by Pierse Brosnan in the film ‘Murphy’s Stroke’ based on the matter. He was also instrumental in introducing the then bookmaker and gambler JP McManus to racehorse ownership. In 1982 the pair combined to win at Cheltenham with Mister Donovan. McManus backed the horse and later admitted: “He was needed!” O’Grady was champion National Hunt trainer in Ireland for four years between 1977 and 1980. He flirted with switching his attentions to the flat but returned to the jumps to some effect with star names such as Nick Dundee, Back In Front and Sound Man. A statement issued by his family through Horse Racing Ireland on Monday said: “It is with profound sadness that we announce the death of Edward O’Grady, who passed away peacefully yesterday evening at St James’s Hospital, surrounded by his family. “Edward was a cherished husband, father and grandfather and also one of the most respected and successful racehorse trainers of his generation. “Over the course of an extraordinary career that spanned more than five decades, Edward trained just shy of 1,700 winners under rules. His name became synonymous with Irish National Hunt racing, and he was a formidable force at Cheltenham and across the racing world. “Beyond the winners and the headlines, Edward was a man of deep intelligence, sharp wit, and remarkable warmth. He had friends on every continent, a story for every occasion, and a lifelong passion for the sport, the hunting field and everything equestrian.” O’Grady’s second wife, Maria, died in a fall while out hunting in 2017. He is survived by their daughters, Mimi and Rosie Mae, as well as his older children, Jonathan, Amber and Lucy.

Title: ‘Strap In’—$4 Trillion Bitcoin And Crypto Braced For A Price Game-Changer

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. Bitcoin has bounced back from a sell-off last week, climbing after a $9 billion earthquake. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price dropped to around $115,000 per bitcoin last week but has rebounded to touch $120,000, propelling the combined crypto market to back over $4 trillion and helped by U.S. president Donald Trump issuing a huge crypto prediction. Now, as Elon Musk’s SpaceX sets bitcoin alarm bells ringing, analysts are predicting the wild bitcoin price swings that have rocked the market in recent years could be over. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run Traders are braced for a major change to the bitcoin price and crypto market. “The days of parabolic bull markets and devastating bear markets are over,” Mitchell Askew, a bitcoin analyst with the bitcoin miner Blockware, posted to X, echoing CryptoQuant chief executive Ki Young Ju who believes the bitcoin four-year cycle theory “is dead.” However, Askew also predicted that the bitcoin price will soar to $1 million over the next 10 years as it switches between “pump” and “consolidate" phases, adding: “It will bore everyone to death along the way and shake the tourists out of their positions. Strap in.” Historically, the bitcoin price has climbed to all-time highs in the years following a bitcoin halving that sees the number of new bitcoin issued to miners in exchange for maintaining the network cut by half. Bitcoin saw significant price surges in the second halves of 2017 and 2021, following halvings that occurred in 2016 and 2020. Bitcoin’s last halving, cutting the bitcoin block reward to 3.125 bitcoins per block, happened in April 2024. Others have also said they believe the so-called four-year bitcoin price cycle is over, pointing to the huge accumulation of bitcoin over the last few years by first Michael Saylor’s Strategy then by bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuers led by BlackRock Strategy now controls 600,000 bitcoin worth $72 billion, sparking a flood of copy cat companies who are buying bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, while the combined bitcoin ETF issuers now hold 1.5 million bitcoin worth $175 billion. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has rocketed higher this year, hitting an all-time high of $123,000 per bitcoin. "The four-year cycle is dead and adoption killed it," Kyle Chassé, a bitcoin and crypto commentator, posted to X alongside a video he appeared in with Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan. "The long-term pro-crypto forces will overwhelm the classic "four-year cycle" forces, to the extent those exist, and that 2026 will be a good year," Hougan said in the clip. “I think it’s more ‘sustained steady boom’ than super-cycle,” Hougan added. “I could be wrong, and I’m certain there will be significant volatility." Other analysts have though pointed to the possibility of unexpected events as either boosting or crashing the bitcoin price—something they warn could happen at any time. “This fifth bitcoin bull market has been characterized by bursts of momentum and sudden pauses, rather than a steady, high sharpe ratio climb,” Markus Thielen, the chief executive of bitcoin price and crypto analysis company 10x Research, said in an emailed note. “Each move has hinged on a clear catalyst: Fed rate expectations, Trump’s political traction, ETF breakthroughs, or regulatory interventions, such as the dismantling of crypto-friendly banks. That’s why staying laser-focused on macro triggers and reacting quickly to breakouts remains critical. In crypto, momentum is sparked by events, not driven by the calendar.”

Ex-BlackRock executive Chalom’s arrival signals SharpLink’s dedication to institutional-grade crypto exposure. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. SharpLink Gaming is accelerating its Ethereum strategy with a major purchase that brings its total holdings closer to a key milestone of 500,000 ETH. On July 28, blockchain analysis platform Lookonchain revealed that the firm acquired 77,210 ETH, worth approximately $295 million. This move brings SharpLink’s total Ethereum reserves to 438,017 ETH, valued at around $1.69 billion. While the company has not formally confirmed the latest buy, the transaction suggests SharpLink is pushing toward a 500,000 ETH target. Reaching that threshold would cement its position as the second-largest known corporate holder of Ethereum, behind only BitMine Immersion, which holds about 566,800 ETH valued at $2.21 billion. Meanwhile, data from Arkham Intelligence shows the newly acquired ETH was staked in 3,200 ETH batches using Figment. The firm is a leading provider of institutional staking infrastructure, offering services to over 500 institutional clients, including asset managers, exchanges, and large token holders. Early market indications show that SharpLink’s Ethereum-focused strategy appears to be resonating with investors. According to Google Finance data, the company’s stock (SBET) has surged over 120% in the past month. As of pre-market trading, the stock is priced at $23.61, up 7.37% on the day This Ethereum acquisition is the first major move since SharpLink named Joseph Chalom as Co-CEO on July 25. Chalom previously led digital asset strategy at BlackRock and played a key role in launching the BUIDL fund, as well as Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. SharpLink’s chairman, Joseph Lubin, said Chalom’s appointment signals the firm’s deeper focus on institutional-grade crypto exposure. He furthered that Ethereum is entering a new phase, one that requires large capital, capable leadership, and long-term alignment. Lubin added: “Joseph brings all three. His decision to join Sharplink is a massive vote of confidence for Ethereum and for the role ETH will play in the future of capital markets. With stablecoins, ETH Treasury companies and top tier talent TradFi is onboarding to DeFI.” Chalom echoed this vision, saying: “Our goal [at SharpLink] is not just to hold ETH, but to activate it, using native staking, restaking, and Ethereum-based yield strategies. All to increase the value of our treasury and create long-term shareholder value.” Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential. He imparts insights on a range of topics like DeFi, hacks, mining and culture, underlining transformative power.

Title: Blackrock Ethereum ETF Crosses $10Bn, How High Can The ETH Price Go In 2025, Is $10K Back On The Cards?

Ethereum’s 2025 bull rally is garnering serious attention — especially now that BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF has crossed more than $10 billion. This has sparked new optimism about the ETH price, with whispers of a potential breakout to $10,000. With old-school giants joining in, projects such as Remittix (RTX) are trending toward more utility-driven strategies, addressing fundamental pain points in cross-border crypto payments. Ethereum is priced at $3,825.95, which is a 2.33% increase within the past 24 hours. The market capitalization of $461.68 billion positions it at the second-largest crypto rank, behind only Bitcoin. Volume traded is lower by 18.4%, though, and is at $24.35 billion, which could be reflective of a short-term breather after weeks of increasing optimism. Most long-term investors are hopeful the ETH price could retest highs. Legacy institutions launching spot ETFs have given renewed life to Layer 2 Ethereum alternatives, DeFi platforms, and crypto with real utility. As hype gathers steam, the search for the next giant altcoin 2025 gets more intense. That shine is increasingly turning towards smaller, high-utility tokens—like Remittix. The Remittix DeFi project is seriously gaining momentum in 2025 with a very specific mission: to enable users to send cryptocurrency directly to fiat bank accounts in 30+ countries. With this fiat bridge, there is no need to go through centralized exchanges, so real-world payments can be easily made by using RTX. The beta wallet, which will roll out in Q3 2025, will cover Ethereum and Solana, with low gas fees and fast transactions. It is best suited for freelancers, global workers, and those in emerging markets where bank services are not available. At $0.0876, Remittix has already raised $17 million+ and sold over 565 million tokens. Early buyers also get a 50% bonus, with the project heading towards its $18 million soft cap. You can buy RTX tokens here and view the wallet beta roadmap for upcoming milestones. The Remittix whitepaper also mentions long-term token deflation and cross-border expansion plans. Why Remittix Is Making Waves in 2025 With a $250,000 Remittix giveaway running and beta around the corner, RTX is in the spotlight as among the most undervalued crypto initiatives today. And while price movement in Ethereum may be the big news, Remittix is building the rails for real-world adoption behind the scenes.

Title: Left-wing hedge fund D.E. Shaw fears ‘reprisals’ over DEI from Trump administration: sources
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/07/28/business/left-wing-hedge-fund-d-e-shaw-fears-reprisals-over-dei-from-trump-administration-sources/
Time Published: 2025-07-28T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
Staffers at the notoriously secretive hedge fund D.E. Shaw fear the wildly lucrative left-wing firm could face “reprisals” from the Trump administration over its woke DEI policies, The Post has learned. The New York-based powerhouse founded by billionaire David E. Shaw — whose algorithm-driven trades made it the most profitable hedge fund in 2024, raking in $11.1 billion for investors, according to Institutional Investor magazine — has grown remarkably quiet of late when it comes to diversity, equality, and inclusion, sources said. D.E. Shaw did not respond to The Post’s emailed request for comment for this article. The company, which gave a young Jeff Bezos his big break in finance before he set up Amazon in 1994, has promoted DEI policies for years. A June 2019 memo obtained by The Post that was written by managing director Eddie Fishman encouraged staffers “to display their pronouns” that “align with their gender identity” in their emails so managers could “foster an inclusive culture.” But a review by The Post of archived pages from D.E. Shaw’s website shows that its DEI language has since been scrubbed, including references to how the firm “actively promotes LGBTQ+ inclusion.” Now, its site merely says it’s seeking “talented people with diverse perspectives and backgrounds.” One insider said top brass at the Wall Street firm — whose 74-year-old namesake helped bankroll the presidential campaigns of Kamala Harris, Joe Biden, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton — made “a strategic move” to steer away from full-throated wokeness over fear of catching the attention of the White House. “There was some concern that aggressive policies would make the firm a target for reprisals by the current administration,” the source said. “And we were about as aggressive as you could get.” “They were going 100 miles an hour on DEI in public, only then to drop to zero and fall off a cliff,’ said another staffer. “The communications have certainly been ratcheted back,” claimed a third employee. “It’s not as in-your-face as it once was.” D.E. Shaw’s retreat follows a Supreme Court ruling last month and a White House-led crackdown on corporate DEI policies, which critics say lower performance standards and foster so-called reverse discrimination. Top Department of Justice lawyer Harmeet K. Dhillon, the assistant attorney general for civil rights, issued the starkest of warnings to corporate America during a testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on July 23. “The goal is clear: either DEI will end on its own, or we will kill it,” the top Trump administration official said. Nevertheless, five sources with direct knowledge of the matter told The Post that executives at the company — founded by computer scientist Shaw in 1988 after he did stints at Stanford, Columbia and Morgan Stanley — are still paying lip service to wokeness to the rank and file. “They have said internally that our commitment and programs regarding DEI are not changing,” said another senior D.E. Shaw source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. “They have themselves in a bit of a bind. They went hardcore DEI to appear progressive and cater to liberal recruits,” a veteran of the firm added. “Internally, they are putting a brave face on it. But they are now very worried that the administration will start looking into them.” Fearing Trump’s ire, the hedge fund appears to have axed its “inclusive” Bridge internship. The program was set up in 2016 for “historically underrepresented” groups in finance. The ‘woke’ job placement schemes still featured prominently on D.E. Shaw’s website last week. But they have now been deleted after The Post approached the firm for comment on their DEI policies on Friday. According to an archived version of D.E. Shaw’s Campus website — an online recruitment portal — the firm created three programs aimed at diverse recruitment. Its “Discovery” program was “designed for students who self-identify as women”, while “Momentum” was aimed at those “who self-identify as part of the LGBTQIA+ community D.E. Shaw also had a program called “Latitude,” which was “for students who self-identify as Native American or Alaska Native, Black or African American, Hispanic or Latino, or Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander.” Other Wall Street giants including Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, Bank of America and Jamie Dimon’s JPMorgan Chase have scaled back their public commitments to DEI. The Post reported exclusively how Goldman decided to give woke the boot — on its website at least — when its partners met with CEO David Solomon in Miami in February. The Post attempted to speak to additional employees at D.E. Shaw, but they declined, citing fears of retribution from D.E. Shaw’s management, which has even been known to weigh in on whether employees can attend social gatherings with people who have left the company. “It is definitely something that people are talking about at the firm,” a separate person briefed on the matter told The Post. “The irony is that the whole firm is still very white and very male,” said another source. The hedge fund’s leadership team counts two females, Alexis Halaby and managing director Anne Dinning, amongst its ranks. The firm last made major headlines in 2022 when it was forced to pay a $52 million defamation settlement to one of its former rising stars, Dan Michalow, after an arbitration panel found that it had falsely accused him of sexual misconduct. Michalow, who always denied any wrongdoing, left the company not long after the start of the #MeToo movement, where hundreds of rich and powerful men were accused of sexual misdeeds. Aside from Amazon’s Bezos and his ex-wife, Mackenzie Scott, D.E. Shaw’s most famous alum is arguably Lawrence Summers. He served as treasury secretary under Bill Clinton and as director of Barack Obama’s National Economic Council. Advertisement

Title: Ethereum price prediction: ETH eyes new all-time highs in August, whales buy up Pepe and Remittix

Ethereum price prediction models are flashing green as August approaches, and institutional demand continues to climb. While ETH aims to break past the $4,500 resistance, investors are also flocking to newer projects like Remittix, which is becoming the go-to cross-border crypto solution in 2025. This August, Ethereum price prediction experts are eyeing strong resistance breakouts. Leading analysts like Fundstrat’s Mark Newton forecast Ethereum reaching $4,000–$4,500 in the short term, with longer-term predictions soaring to $15,000–$20,000 by year-end (Changelly forecast, Finance Magnates update). Driving this optimism is a surge in Ethereum ETF inflows led by BlackRock, coupled with reduced liquid supply as more ETH is staked across DeFi protocols. This bullish cycle aligns with major trends like the rise of Layer 2 Ethereum alternatives and top crypto to buy lists focused on blue-chip altcoins. With decentralized exchange volume climbing and smart contract usage on the rise, ETH is once again leading the charge among long-term crypto investments. Remittix is making waves in the early stage crypto investment scene. Whale activity has surged since the announcement of its Q3 wallet beta, which enables direct crypto-to-bank transfers in 30+ countries. At a price of $0.0876, over 551 million tokens have already been sold, raising $17.4M+ to date. This cross-chain DeFi project is solving real problems in borderless finance—and investors are paying attention. A Nigerian freelancer recently used Remittix to accept ETH and convert it to mobile funds to support his family instantly. That’s the kind of utility missing from most low cap crypto gems. Remittix is quietly becoming the breakout presale of 2025, as smart investors seek crypto with passive income potential and real-world impact. While Remittix delivers utility, Pepe continues to attract meme coin momentum. Whale wallets have scooped up trillions of tokens recently, including a massive $22M withdrawal from Binance. These high-volume moves signal bullish sentiment. Source: TradingView PEPE is forming a bullish cup-and-handle chart structure, with traders predicting gains of 40% or more. It’s a speculative bet, but one that still commands strong attention in the meme coin space. Ethereum price prediction targets remain high for August, but whales aren’t just holding ETH. They’re hedging into upcoming crypto projects like Remittix and low gas fee crypto plays like PEPE for broader exposure this bull cycle. If you’re looking for the next 100x crypto, this could be your signal.

Title: DWF Ventures Analyzes Catalysts Behind ETH’s Price Rally, Including Rising Institutional Interest

July 28, 2025 – Dubai, United Arab Emirates It examines the catalysts behind ETH’s rally, which has seen its price rise by 70% in the past month, with a particular focus on institutional support. In its analysis, first published as an X thread, DWF Ventures assesses whether ETH’s recent performance is indicative of an Ethereum season arriving, propelling both ETH and the assets its EVM ecosystem supports to greater heights. DWF pinpoints the triggers that have prompted ETH to break out of a three-year downtrend and flip bullish. The Web 3.0 investment firm notes that ETH’s recent price rise hasn’t occurred in a vacuum but is rather the product of growing interest in the Ethereum ecosystem. On-chain activity on Ethereum has been increasing steadily including transactions, active addresses, volume and the total percentage of ETH staked. Many of these metrics are at or approaching ATHs (all-time highs), paving the way for ETH to move up. As highlighted in the report, institutions are increasingly acquiring ETH as a strategic asset, whose ETF inflows have surged past 230,000 ETH in a single day, while the ETH/BTC ratio has broken out of a multi-year downtrend. The analysis observes that companies are leveraging ETH for treasury diversification, capitalizing on its yield-generating potential through staking and DeFi integrations. It also asserts that greater regulatory clarity, aided by legislation such as the GENIUS Act, has provided the transparency required to attract cautious investors, paving the way for sustained upward momentum. Public companies that have purchased significant quantities of ETH include SharpLink Gaming, which DWF Ventures records as having purchased over $1 billion of the crypto asset since May 2025. It acknowledges that BTC remains the asset of choice for public companies acquiring crypto but suggests that ETH’s ability to generate native yield via staking is desirable for preferred stock holders who are accustomed to receiving dividends. Other tailwinds contributing to ETH’s rally, as outlined by DWF Ventures, include the CLARITY Act, which places less restrictions on institutions accessing ETH because it is regarded as a commodity rather than a security. It also notes that while the GENIUS Act was primarily concerned with stablecoins, Ethereum’s dominance of almost 50% of the total stablecoin market cap will work in its favor as stablecoin capitalization increases. DWF Ventures concludes by analyzing increased institutional demand to bring capital on-chain through tokenized RWAs (real-world assets) and participation in DeFi, with Ethereum overwhelmingly the blockchain of choice. It cites global institutions including BlackRock, PayPal, Deutsche Bank and UBS – all utilizing Ethereum infrastructure. The analysis finishes by saying, “The strong performance of associated sectors and tokens are encouraging signs of a potential ‘ETH szn,’ especially for protocols that share and benefit from overlapping tailwinds in clearer regulation, stablecoin expansion and onboarding of institutional capital.” The full ETH analysis from DWF Ventures can be read here.

East Asia A view of the Balboa Port is pictured in Panama City, Panama on Mar 4, 2025. (File photo: Reuters/Enea Lebrun) HONG KONG: Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison said Monday (Jul 28) it was considering inviting a Chinese "major strategic investor" to join a United States-led consortium negotiating the sale of its global ports business outside China, including operations at the Panama Canal. The firm said in March it was offloading the ports - including operations in the vital Central American waterway - to a group led by asset manager BlackRock for US$19 billion in cash. The consortium was to include BlackRock subsidiary Global Infrastructure Partners and Terminal Investment Limited, a subsidiary of the Mediterranean Shipping Company.

Loading The sale was seen as a political victory for US President Donald Trump, who had vowed to "take back" the Panama Canal from alleged Chinese control, prompting Beijing's ire. China's market regulator said in March it was reviewing the deal. In May, Hutchison co-managing director, Dominic Lai told shareholders that Terminal Investment was the main investor. Its parent company is led by Italian shipping scion Diego Aponte. Aponte's family reportedly has a longstanding relationship with the owner of CK Hutchison Li Ka-shing, who is also Hong Kong's richest man. "(CK Hutchison) remains in discussions with members of the consortium with a view to inviting (a) major strategic investor from (China) to join as a significant member of the consortium," CK Hutchison said in a stock exchange filing Monday. The firm added that changes to the consortium's membership and deal structure will be needed for the deal "to be capable of being approved by all relevant authorities". It said the "period for exclusive negotiations" mentioned in the March announcement had expired, but discussions will continue. It did not name the major investor. The deadline for their exclusive negotiation period ended on Jul 27.

The deadline for their exclusive negotiation period ended on Jul 27. China's biggest shipping company Cosco was set to join the consortium and was requesting veto rights or equivalent powers, Bloomberg News reported. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Denise Wong told the outlet that "ongoing negotiations and the reported inclusion of Cosco Shipping in the consortium have likely eased concerns over Chinese regulatory hurdles, strengthening investor confidence in the deal's viability". Gary Ng, senior economist for Asia Pacific at Natixis, said Monday's developments show that "business deals can be increasingly subject to politics in the new economic and geopolitical reality" as the Hong Kong conglomerate seeks to "keep everyone happy". CK Hutchison said it "intends to allow such time as is required for such discussions to achieve" a workable arrangement. It said it had stated on several occasions that it "will not proceed with any transaction that does not have the approval of all relevant authorities". The initial deal, valued at nearly US$23 billion including US$5 billion in debt, would have given the consortium control over 43 ports in 23 countries, including the ports of Balboa and Cristobal, located at either end of the canal. That agreement also required approval from Panama’s government. Its Hong Kong-listed shares fell 0.6 per cent Monday, while Cosco dropped 2.2 per cent. AFP has contacted Cosco for comment.

Title: Earn $8900 a day with your mobile phone with BTC Miner!

As the price of Bitcoin (BTC) steadily runs in the range of $118,000 to $120,000, the market’s expectations for it to hit historical highs again are getting stronger. With the continuous increase in institutional holdings and the continuous inflow of funds on the chain, the crypto market is entering a structural growth cycle with policy loosening, capital acceleration, and technology upgrading as the core. But for ordinary investors, facing the reality of high currency prices and volatility, how to enter the market and how to make stable profits? Smart cloud mining platform BTC Miner may be the answer. According to Coindesk data, Bitcoin has tested the area above $119,000 many times in the past 72 hours, and the technical side shows strong support signs. If it can successfully break through the current platform consolidation area, the next target may be $130,000. At the same time, on-chain data shows that Bitcoin’s “realized cap” has exceeded $1 trillion for the first time, which means that more long-term investors will include BTC in their core asset allocation rather than a short-term speculative tool. This bull market is no longer driven by emotions, but a systematic revaluation driven by ETF funds, policy shifts and institutional buying. BTC Miner: Ordinary people can also seize institutional dividends While the crypto market is developing rapidly, BTC Miner is using a simple, efficient, and automated way to provide ordinary investors around the world with a low threshold to enter the mining income. Five core advantages of the platform: 1. Zero technical threshold, one-click mining Users do not need equipment or blockchain knowledge; they only need to register and purchase contracts, and the system automatically allocates computing power and participates in the mining of mainstream currencies such as BTC, XRP, ETH, and DOGE. 2. Daily automatic settlement, transparent income to the account The platform implements an automatic income calculation and distribution mechanism, and you can see the income account every day, which is clear and traceable, avoiding the uncertainty of waiting and fluctuations. 3. Register to get $500 computing power, free trial mining for new users BTC Miner gives $500 computing power to all new users, and you can experience the real mining process without recharging, and the daily stable income is credited to your account in real time. 4. Multi-currency support, global use Supports recharge and withdrawal of mainstream crypto assets such as BTC, ETH, XRP, USDT, DOGE, etc., and the internal income is calculated in US dollars, which is unified and transparent. Referral rewards, build a passive income network Through the invitation mechanism, users can get up to 7% rebate to create a sustainable passive income model. Bitcoin has entered an upward track, but the investment threshold is also rising simultaneously. Compared with the high volatility and high threshold of direct currency holding, BTC Miner provides a lightweight and stable income alternative: purchase computing power contracts from a minimum of $200, with an annualized income of up to 180%+. BTC Miner continues to optimize product structure and profit mechanism, and launches diversified contract solutions suitable for all types of investors. All plans support automatic settlement of daily income, and return principal when the contract expires, which is simple and transparent: Contract principal Contract period Daily income Total income at expiration (Actual income is intelligently adjusted according to market conditions and contract types, transparent and traceable) Especially in the stage where the currency price has not yet broken through significantly and the mining difficulty is still controllable, early entrants can obtain more attractive returns. Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of BlackRock, recently said that the Federal Reserve should cut interest rates as soon as possible to release liquidity; Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Fund, suggested that investors allocate at least 15% of their assets to Bitcoin and gold. All signs indicate that Bitcoin is gradually becoming a new generation of “risk hedging and value-added” dual tools. For most ordinary investors who cannot deploy capital and resources like institutions, the cloud mining platform BTC Miner provides an opportunity to stand at the same starting line as institutions. You can also make money through invitations: just share your personal invitation link. Directly invite friend B: 7% rebate [Friend B invests $10,000, you can get $700] Friend B invites C: 2% rebate [C invests $10,000, you can get $200] Build an exclusive computing power network, earn while using, and share the benefits! The price of Bitcoin is on the eve of a key breakthrough, and the BTC Miner cloud mining platform has opened a stable door to high returns for ordinary people. It is not only a new way to participate, but also a passive income tool that resists inflation and stabilizes growth. If you want to seize this round of structural bull market, act now.

Title: Hong Kong's CK Hutchison seeks Chinese investor to join Panama Ports deal
URL: https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/hong-kongs-ck-hutchison-seeks-chinese-investor-join-124126111

A Hong Kong conglomerate that’s selling ports at the Panama Canal says it may seek a Chinese investor to join a consortium of buyers HONG KONG -- A Hong Kong conglomerate that had agreed to sell its two ports at the Panama Canal said Monday it may seek a Chinese investor to join a consortium of buyers, a move that could please Beijing but bring more U.S. scrutiny to the geopolitically fraught deal. CK Hutchison Holdings’ initial plan to sell port assets in dozens of countries to a group that includes U.S. investment firm BlackRock Inc. pleased U.S. President Donald Trump, who has alleged that China interferes with the critical shipping lane’s operations in Panama. However, the deal apparently angered Beijing and drew a review by Chinese anti-monopoly authorities. After months of uncertainty brought by tensions between Washington and Beijing, Hutchison said in a statement Monday that the exclusive negotiations period with the consortium had expired. However, it added “the Group remains in discussions with members of the consortium with a view to inviting major strategic investor from the PRC to join as a significant member of the consortium,” referring to the People’s Republic of China. It said it needed to change the membership of the consortium and the structure of the transaction for the deal to be able to pass reviews by “all relevant authorities.” In Beijing, a Chinese official said the government had noted the announcement but did not comment directly on it. “The Chinese government will conduct supervision in accordance with the law, firmly safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests, and maintain market fairness and justice,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said at a daily briefing. A Hutchison subsidiary has operated the ports of Balboa and Cristobal at both ends of the Panama Canal since 1997. The awkward position Hutchison found itself in for months highlights the challenges Hong Kong business elites face in navigating Beijing’s expectations of national loyalty, especially when relations between China and the United States are strained. CK Hutchison is owned by the family of Hong Kong’s richest man, Li Ka-shing. It announced March 4 that it would sell all its shares in Hutchison Port Holdings and in Hutchison Port Group Holdings to the consortium that also includes BlackRock subsidiary Global Infrastructure Partners and Terminal Investment Limited, a subsidiary of the Mediterranean Shipping Company. A Beijing-backed newspaper in Hong Kong posted scathing commentaries about the deal, with one describing it as a betrayal of all Chinese. Chinese government offices overseeing Hong Kong affairs reposted some of the commentaries, widely seen as an indication of the Chinese leaders’ stance. In May, Hutchinson co-managing director, Dominic Lai told shareholders that Terminal Investment was the main investor. Its parent company is led by Italian shipping scion Diego Aponte, whose family reportedly has a longstanding relationship with Li’s. The initial deal, valued at nearly $23 billion including $5 billion in debt, would have given the consortium control over 43 ports in 23 countries, including the two at the Panama Canal. That agreement would have also required approval from Panama’s government. The deadline for the exclusive negotiation period ended on Sunday. The Panamanian government maintains it has full control over the canal and that the operation of the ports by Hutchison does not mean Chinese control of it. ___ Associated Press writer Ken Moritsugu in Beijing contributed. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Subscribe Today's print edition Home Delivery CK Hutchison said it may invite a "major strategic investor” from China to join a group seeking to buy its global ports, as the Hong Kong-based company works toward a solution that pleases all in the geopolitically sensitive deal. The unnamed investor would join as a significant member of the consortium, the company said in a stock exchange filing Monday, hours after the expiry of a 145-day exclusive talks window with the group backed by American asset manager BlackRock. "Changes to the membership of the consortium and the structure of the transaction will be needed for the transaction to be capable of being approved by all relevant authorities,” CK Hutchison said, adding that it "intends to allow such time as is required for such discussions.” In a time of both misinformation and too much information, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Join the leading maritime news network A view of the Balboa Port is pictured after Hong Kong's CK Hutchison agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a BlackRock Inc-backed consortium, amid pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to curb China's influence in the region, Panama City, Panama, March 4, 2025. REUTERS/Enea Lebrun By Shirley Zhao Jul 27, 2025 (Bloomberg) –Investors are regaining enthusiasm for CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. despite a delay in the company’s plan to sell 43 ports, with optimism fueled by news that a Chinese shipping behemoth is finding its way into the global deal. Shares of CK Hutchison, which oscillated between gains and losses since the company first announced the deal on March 4, reached the highest this year on Friday after state-owned China Cosco Shipping Corp. emerged as a potential new member of the buyer consortium that includes American asset manager BlackRock Inc. Although a 145-day exclusivity window for talks between CK Hutchison and the buyers’ group lapsed on Sunday, the possible involvement of China Cosco is boosting expectations that it would nudge the transaction forward. Beijing has so far viewed the deal as a threat to its interests because it would transfer two ports along the strategically important Panama Canal to the BlackRock-backed group, which China sees as a proxy for American influence. “Ongoing negotiations and the reported inclusion of Cosco Shipping in the consortium have likely eased concerns over Chinese regulatory hurdles, strengthening investor confidence in the deal’s viability,” according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Denise Wong. China separately warned the parties involved not to bypass antitrust reviews, so as to prevent them from rushing into a deal. As of last week, the buyers’ group was considering China Cosco’s demand for veto rights to secure Beijing’s interests, Bloomberg News reported. CK Hutchison’s shares, which shot up 37% in the days following the sale announcement in March, saw political pressure wipe out all the gains in the space of a month. The stock started rallying again last month as investors flocked back after China Cosco came into play. The share price recovery shows investors are increasingly betting on Li Ka-shing, the 96-year-old founder of CK Hutchison, to seal the deal of his lifetime. If it goes through, the sale will net the group more than $19 billion in cash. The renewed optimism is largely due to China Cosco’s interest in playing a role in the buying consortium, alongside BlackRock and Italian billionaire Gianluigi Aponte’s Terminal Investment Ltd. Initially hailed as a smart move by Li to exit a business caught up in global trade tensions, the deal quickly drew the ire of Beijing. With President Donald Trump billing the transaction as the return of Panama Canal back to American influence, that didn’t help. Challenges remain even as Cosco enters the discussions, David Blennerhassett, an analyst at Quiddity Advisors, wrote on financial analysis platform SmartKarma. That could reverse the current rhetoric and upset Trump, who has a handful of issues already on his plate, he said. CK Hutchison’s share price could also be under pressure should talks on the sale drag on, he added. Even with an extended timeline, revised terms or a partial agreement, uncertainty around the deal’s value and timing would increase, said Bloomberg Intelligence’s Wong. The delay may also fuel concerns about regulatory and policy challenges, she said. Investors will be watching out for more answers to questions surrounding the deal, including what role the Chinese side will play in the consortium, said Gary Ng, a senior economist at Natixis. The controversial deal has also weighed on Li and his family’s other businesses. Younger son Richard’s talks to expand his insurance business into mainland China have stalled after the ports deal upset Beijing, Bloomberg reported earlier this month. That followed another Bloomberg report in March that China told its state-owned firms to hold off on any new collaboration with businesses linked to the Li family. The original structure of the buyer consortium was designed to give the Aponte family-controlled Terminal Investment ownership of all the ports except the two in Panama, whose control will go to BlackRock’s Global Infrastructure Partners unit. © 2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: Slow And Steady Wins? Bitcoin To Hit $1M Via ‘Pump’ And ‘Consolidate’ Pattern: Expert
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/slow-steady-expert-says-bitcoin-to-reach-1-million/
Time Published: 2025-07-27T23:00:07Z

The bull cycle was deemed over when the price of Bitcoin tragically fell toward $75,000 earlier in March 2025. Having notched an all-time high of above $100,000, most investors feared that the premier cryptocurrency had already reached its top for the current cycle. Contrary to popular belief, the price of Bitcoin has since forged multiple new all-time highs, with the current record high at around $122,800. Interestingly, the now-popular market consensus is that it is only a matter of time before the BTC price reaches a seven-figure valuation. In a recent post on the X platform, Blockware Bitcoin analyst Mitchell Askew has joined a growing list of experts to put forward a $1 million projection for the premier cryptocurrency. According to the analyst, the price of BTC is expected to achieve this major milestone over the next 10 years. What’s interesting is that Askew expects the Bitcoin price to reach a $1 million valuation in the next 10 years. The crypto intelligence expert believes that “the days of parabolic bull markets and devastating bear markets are over” for the flagship cryptocurrency. Askew highlighted that Bitcoin looks like two entirely different assets before and after the launch of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States. With this shift, the analyst expects the price of BTC to reach $1 million through a consistent oscillation between “pump” and “consolidate.” Askew added: It will bore everyone to death along the way and shake the tourists out of their positions. It is worth mentioning that Askew’s thesis aligns with the recent claim that the Bitcoin cycle theory is dead. In essence, both beliefs state that the premier cryptocurrency is now less likely to experience the extended bear market that typically follows after a bull run — a theory based on the introduction of institutional players through spot ETFs. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas agreed with Askew’s theory about the movement and trajectory of the Bitcoin price since the spot exchange-traded funds hit the market. According to the pundit, the Bitcoin market has witnessed less volatility and fewer corrections since BlackRock filed for a spot BTC ETF. Ultimately, the air of increased stability around the premier cryptocurrency has made it a more attractive investment option for large institutional players. Balchunas also acknowledged that the BTC price is now less likely to experience major surges in short periods — as seen in the past. Over the past week, the price of Bitcoin moved mostly sideways, oscillating between the $120,000 and $115,000 levels. As of this writing, the market leader is valued at around $117,900, reflecting a 0.4% price increase in the past day. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Year of the stablecoin: The GENIUS Act, Wall Street, and the dollar’s digital leap

Leading experts share their insights into the future of money as the GENIUS Act redefines finance in 2025 and beyond. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Welcome to Slate Sundays, CryptoSlate’s new weekly feature showcasing in-depth interviews, expert analysis, and thought-provoking op-eds that go beyond the headlines to explore the ideas and voices shaping the future of crypto. If 2024 was the year of the dragon, 2025 has been the year of the stablecoin. U.S. dollar-backed digital assets, in particular, have taken front and center stage, achieving buy-in all the way from the highest office. The World Liberty stablecoin, USD1, was launched in March by a DeFi platform majority-owned by members of the Trump family. Then Vice President JD Vance set the stage alight at the Bitcoin Conference in May, clarifying the administration’s bullish stance on stablecoins and their ability to act as a “force multiplier” for U.S. economic power. Stablecoin issuer Circle’s $20 billion IPO followed, igniting what the Bankless podcast duo coined “stablecoin summer.” And last week, the GENIUS Act was signed into law, becoming the first piece of U.S. legislation to directly regulate digital assets, creating a turning point for global finance. Even Jamie Dimon’s getting in on the action despite his personal skepticism about Bitcoin and digital assets. He may publicly claim not to understand their appeal, but there has long been a gap between what Dimon says and what Dimon does: America’s largest bank has been a pioneer in blockchain technology, developing its own stablecoin, JPM Coin, since 2019. So, what’s with all the latest developments in moving value worldwide, and what does the GENIUS Act mean for the future of crypto, TradFi, and the global economy? I asked experts from the technical, legal, and financial fields to throw some light on the subject and unpack the types of advancements we may see in the years ahead. For those of you who’ve been hiding under a rock, let me guide you out of your shadowy abode. The GENIUS Act stands for “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act of 2025,” but “GENIUS” is a lot more catchy. It’s the first comprehensive U.S. federal law that specifically regulates “payment stablecoins” (AKA, digital tokens pegged to fiat money). The GENIUS Act establishes a long-awaited licensing and oversight regime for stablecoin issuers, mandating full 1:1 reserve backing, imposing strict consumer protection measures, and creating a clear legal footing for integrating stablecoins into mainstream finance. The law also bars non-financial companies like the Facebooks and Googles of this world from issuing stablecoins without special approval, applying substantial penalties for noncompliance (violations can incur fines of up to $200,000 per day, and criminal penalties including up to five years’ imprisonment). Why is the GENIUS Act such a big deal? Well, because after years of opacity and uncertainty surrounding stablecoin issuers in the United States, it provides the first federal legal framework, providing clarity on how to run their operations. As international law firm, Winston & Strawn LLP writes in a recent blog: “The Act pushes stablecoin issuers into a regulatory regime similar to that of banks. For many firms, this means a need to hire compliance officers, invest in risk management systems, and potentially partner with experienced regulated institutions to meet the standards set by Congress.” Moon Pursuit Capital is a fast-growing crypto investment fund. Its founder, Utkarsh Ahuja, shared his thoughts on just how groundbreaking the GENIUS Act is, commenting: “The GENIUS Act is a major step forward, not just for crypto, but for U.S. leadership in global finance. For the first time, we have clear rules around stablecoins, which are the backbone of open, programmable money infrastructure. For too long, uncertainty has held the industry back and driven builders offshore. The GENIUS Act changes that. It gives stablecoins legal clarity and sets the stage for broader crypto adoption.” Genna Garver is a partner at the international law firm Troutman Pepper Locke LLP. She also provided her thoughts on the GENIUS Act to share with CryptoSlate readers. She said: “This is a watershed moment for institutional financial services. The GENIUS Act authorizes the tokenization of fiat currency and regulation of the same, thereby legitimizing digital US dollarization.” Guillaume Poncin is CTO at Alchemy, a developer platform that facilitates over $100 billion in transactions annually for businesses across the ecosystem, from Fortune 500 firms like Robinhood, Visa, JPMorgan, and PayPal, to crypto-native companies like Coinbase and Circle. He told me via written commentary: “The GENIUS Act provides the clarity that institutions have been waiting for, and it helps legitimize programmable money that operates at internet speed. This legislation is important because it reduces regulatory uncertainty that has held back institutional adoption.” What’s more, the GENIUS Act does not exist in a vacuum. With a groundswell of favorable momentum toward digital assets from the current administration, the tailwinds are blowing like crazy. The unwinding of the stranglehold on crypto during the Biden years, and the repeal of key pieces of prohibitive legislation such as SAB 121, which prevented U.S. banks from providing custody of digital assets, are creating a perfect storm. Poncin enthused: “We saw immediate interest from major banks that had previously been cautious. Now, with GENIUS in place, we believe every major bank will move toward issuing or supporting stablecoins in some form. It unlocks the next era of programmable money that is trusted, regulated, and built for internet-scale speed.” The GENIUS Act also serves to extend U.S. dollar dominance, spurring innovation based on the USD and reinforcing the dollar’s standing as the world’s reserve currency for decades to come. As crypto-native investment firm, CoinFund, president Chris Perkins commented: “The GENIUS Act will go down in history as a law that served as a foundational step in the mainstreaming of crypto as an asset class. By catalyzing innovation on our greatest export, the greenback, GENIUS will position the dollar as the global reserve currency for decades to come, enhance national security, and unlock financial opportunity across the globe Stablecoins deliver obvious utility by offering inexpensive, 24/7 payments. But, by enabling seamless and efficient access to U.S. dollars across the developing world, stablecoins will also serve as a store of value when local monetary policy goes awry.” Stablecoins have come a long way from their original use case as a means to store wealth, while avoiding the volatility of digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, to be enshrined in a landmark bill recognizing them as key financial infrastructure. So what are some of the main use cases the GENIUS Act enables, and what can we expect from the coming years? Ahuja comments: “The GENIUS Act unlocks real innovation, instant remittances, AI-native payments, and global commerce without intermediaries.” Poncin adds: “The opportunity in stablecoins isn’t in holding them, unless they’re being used in DeFi for yield opportunities. The real opportunity lies in companies issuing their own stablecoins, such as payment processors integrating stablecoins and fintechs launching their own tokens. We’re seeing fintechs generate meaningful revenue from stablecoin reserves through treasury management. This can potentially be $100M+ annually on $2-3B in deposits. The real value creation comes from how stablecoins are enabling the new financial system.” Beyond experimenting with its own stablecoins, JPMorgan made headlines this week for its moves to allow clients, particularly institutional ones, to use bitcoin as collateral for loans. Thanks to the GENIUS Act, the bank is developing a new program that would allow clients to pledge their Bitcoin or Ether holdings to secure cash loans, much as they might with stocks or real estate. While JPMorgan already enabled clients to borrow against crypto ETFs, the move to accept direct crypto holdings as collateral is a paradigm shift for an institution helmed by one of the industry’s most vocal critics. The GENIUS Act’s significance extends across the industry, with DeFi platforms and tokenized RWAs taking note as well. Orest Gavryliak, the chief legal officer at DEX aggregation pioneer, 1inch Labs, told me: “Tokenized technology has become a major area of focus for TradFi giants like BlackRock, JPMorgan, and more, as it represents marked improvement on the current setup of financial standards. It is also a major benefit in terms of the accessibility of liquidity. By transcending geographic barriers, the global nature of tokenization, enabled by blockchain technology, allows markets with limited, isolated liquidity to unify and access liquidity from multiple sources—available 24/7, in real time.” Poncin expands: “Banks will enable customers ‘investor-grade opportunities, like trading in private equities, and get loans against their holdings. Small businesses can finally harness the remote work era to pay overseas workers affordably. We’re about to see a flood of not one, but hundreds of stablecoin ‘killer apps’, all enabling people to exchange and create value in ways unimaginable just months ago. Tokenized treasuries are growing significantly. Stablecoin issuers, such as Tether, hold substantial U.S. debt positions. We’re seeing increased interest in tokenizing traditionally illiquid assets like private credit and real estate to unlock liquidity. There’s also growing development of infrastructure to make RWAs composable with DeFi protocols. The real innovation is about making these assets programmable. This enables new financial products like automated lending against tokenized assets or smart contracts that can interact with real-world collateral.” One interesting clause in the GENIUS Act is the prohibition on paying interest or yield to stablecoin holders, which could mean an explosion of demand in DeFi yield-earning opportunities. Perkins says: “Under GENIUS, stablecoins do not pay interest to end users, and without interest, stablecoins are depreciating assets. So, holders will seek yield. And that’s where DeFi comes in. If the Treasury Department’s projections are correct and trillions of stablecoins come into the system, expect DeFi summer on steroids as users seek to maximize yield by engaging across a variety of yield strategies. Users will be drawn to yield-bearing vaults, and they will commission AI agents to optimize their returns. With the U.S. back in the lead, countries around the world will need to accelerate and optimize stablecoin policies of their own. The $7.5 trillion per day FX market stands to benefit. Watch this space.” Will Beeson, founder of MultiLiquid, and former co-lead of Standard Chartered’s Tokenization platform, comments: “The outright ban on stablecoin yield marks a critical inflection point. Capital is already shifting. Ethereum is outperforming Bitcoin as traders seek returns via Ethereum-native protocols and tokenized funds. The stablecoin market is entering a phase where only institutions that can put capital to work efficiently will survive. But there’s a bottleneck: stablecoins move 24/7, Treasurys don’t. Liquidity infrastructure that bridges this gap is now mission-critical.” Gavryliak adds: “Regulatory clarity, like the GENIUS Act, means companies and institutions can now look to leverage stablecoins for fast, cost-efficient cross-border payments, treasury optimization, and real-time settlement, bypassing TradFi banking rails and unlocking operational efficiencies. It’s a positive step forward for DeFi. It also provides security for institutions and other TradFi operators, who can now put their full weight behind the sector. Those previously just dipping their toes in can now dive headfirst with the clear guardrails.” With digital assets an increasingly partisan issue, and key Democrats like Elizabeth Warren holding onto her anti-crypto army, is there any risk of the GENIUS Act, or any other legislation, being reversed if and when the blue team returns to power? And with the Trump family so overtly benefiting from digital assets, does this clear conflict of interest pose any threat? Poncin believes it’s too late for that: “The momentum in crypto adoption transcends political divisions. We work with institutions across the spectrum that recognize blockchain’s potential. The repeal of SAB 121 had bipartisan elements, and there are crypto advocates across party lines. Major banks, asset managers, and payment companies are building on blockchain because it offers superior technology for settlement and programmable money. Moreover, the cryptocurrency industry has demonstrated resilience in the face of various challenges over the years. What matters is that institutions are building real utility on blockchain. These use cases exist because they solve real-world problems, such as settlement speed, operational costs, and 24/7 availability. That’s what drives lasting adoption.” Garver is also positive that GENIUS brings in lasting change. She says: “During the legislative process, there were numerous attempts to debate and offer amendments to the bill to address certain conflicts of interest, but those amendments were not adopted as part of the final GENIUS Act. Now that we have final legislation authorizing permitted payment stablecoins, digital asset adoption likely will depend more on the use cases. Not unlike ATM adoption of the last generation, at some point, it’s just too convenient and beneficial not to get on board. I don’t see potential users sitting on the sidelines as a sign of protest. I think the ship will quickly sail, and crypto will become too integrated into the fiber of our economy, the global economy, and the financial services industry.” With the ballooning global debt, liquidity expansion, geopolitical uncertainty, and lowering interest rates, favorable regulation for digital assets in the U.S. could mean that “nothing stops this train.” As Ahuja affirms: This is, frankly, as constructive a macro setup as you can ask for, short of resolving event-driven risks like tariffs or Middle East escalation. But from a pure market-structure and liquidity standpoint, the conditions are primed. We’re entering a rare window where fundamentals, liquidity, and macro dynamics are all pointing in the same direction; and that’s precisely when the most compelling upside gets unlocked.” Christina is a web3 writer, editor, and content manager with a passion for technology and starting important conversations.

Title: Bitcoin’s Parabolic Glory Days May Be Over, Analyst Claims

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Bitcoin has climbed 250% since BlackRock’s IBIT launch. But those massive green candles—spikes traders chase—could become a thing of the past. According to Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas, the era of sudden jolts up or down may be ending. He says that spot ETFs and big companies piling in will smooth out those drawdowns. Balchunas pointed out that IBIT just passed $100 billion in assets under management. Based on his view, that landmark tells you everything. Bitcoin traded between $116,000 and $120,000 after Galaxy Digital sold 80,000 coins. No panic sell‑off followed. Before ETFs, a sale like that could send prices tumbling by double‑digit percentages. Now, deep corrections look less likely. This guy gets it. We’ve been saying same thing. Since BlackRock filing Bitcoin is up like 250% with much less volatility and no vomit-inducing drawdowns. This has helped it attract even bigger fish and gives it fighting chance to be adopted as currency. Downside is prob no more… https://t.co/0ECd5XevcO — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 26, 2025 In‑and‑out profit‑hunters once drove Bitcoin up or down by 20% or more in a day. But steady inflows from regulated products lure in large investors. Balchunas argues that fewer wild swings will make crypto more useful for buying coffee or paying bills. He believes this shift will help Bitcoin behave more like a real currency and not just a roller‑coaster asset. Based on reports from Citigroup, every $1 billion of ETF inflows can lift Bitcoin by about 3.6%. Using that math, Citi sees Bitcoin hitting $199,000 before December 31. That forecast depends on steady money flowing in. Big funds make big bets. And those bets tend to stick around longer than retail traders chasing quick gains. Citigroup notes that BlackRock’s IBIT became the fastest ETF to reach $100 billion. That matters because it shows how hungry big players are for crypto. If those trends keep up, Bitcoin could push past its current trading band. It may even test new highs without the classic “God candle” leaps that gave quick fortunes—and quick losses. Meanwhile, some analysts warn that early Bitcoin whales are taking profits and stepping aside. As institutions arrive, some old‑school traders will leave. That could shift volume to less regulated spots or exotic derivatives markets. In a calmer main market, risks may hide in side channels. Lower volatility brings fewer heart‑stopping moments. It also means less of the adrenaline rush that attracts day‑traders. For some, that trade‑off is worth it. For others, the loss of big swings could drive them away. Overall, Bitcoin seems to be entering a new phase. Based on Balchunas’s take, those “God candles” won’t vanish overnight—but they’ll be rare. The push from spot ETFs and corporate treasuries aims to make price moves smoother. Featured image from Meta, chart from TradingView They say journalists never truly clock out.

When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: BlackRock’s CIO fires at Fed’s policy delay: ‘It’s not a goods economy’

With crypto inflows rising and Fed criticism peaking, Rieder’s support for rate cuts may shift the macro winds this week. BlackRock’s Rick Rieder pushes for rate cuts as the crypto industry and housing sector strain under Fed policy. With ETH ETF inflows surging past BTC, all eyes now turn to the upcoming FOMC decision. With just four days to go before the Federal Reserve’s next FOMC meeting, the debate around interest rates is heating up, drawing in voices from both Wall Street and the crypto industry. This time, it’s not just crypto-native investors calling for rate relief. BlackRock’s Chief Investment Officer, Rick Rieder, has entered the conversation. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Rieder urged the Fed to begin slashing interest rates. He argued that the broader U.S. economy and particularly the service sector would benefit from such a shift. That said, markets have heard this tune before. Earlier this month, traders piled into Bitcoin [BTC] ahead of a strong U.S. jobs report, hoping the Fed would finally pivot—only to be met with data that reaffirmed its hawkish stance. As previously reported, that macro surprise cooled crypto momentum and reminded investors that the Fed’s next move remains tightly tethered to real-world labor and inflation numbers. Rieder’s comments contrast with prevailing sentiment on Wall Street, where many still favor a cautious or minimal easing approach. For the crypto sector, however, Rieder’s remarks could serve as a critical point of validation, as lower interest rates historically fuel investor appetite for risk assets like Bitcoin. He said, “The service economy is what drives this economy today. It’s not a goods-oriented economy, not commodities, not exports, not manufacturing.” Further in the interview, Rick Rieder emphasized that the Fed’s current approach to inflation may no longer be effective in today’s service-dominated economy. According to the BlackRock executive, aggressive rate hikes are now doing more harm than good, particularly in sectors like housing, where the impact is most pronounced. “The real impact of interest rates on the economy today… it’s about housing.” These individuals, he noted, are the ones most reliant on credit and now face increasing barriers to home ownership. Rieder argued that easing rates could spur more housing construction and improve affordability, ultimately benefiting the broader economy. He added, “If we get the rate down, you actually can bring home prices down. You build more houses, you’ll actually reduce inflation.” This shows that his stance not only challenges the Fed’s current policy direction but also adds weight to the growing call, especially from within the crypto industry. However, despite the Fed’s continued concerns about inflation, BlackRock’s Rieder pointed out that even a rate cut to 3.25% would remain above current inflation levels. Still, optimism for an imminent Fed rate cut remains low. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, there’s a 95.9% probability that interest rates will remain unchanged after July’s FOMC meeting, with only a slim 4.1% chance of a cut. Meanwhile, Ethereum [ETH] ETFs have outpaced Bitcoin [BTC] in inflows, with ETH seeing $1.85 billion in net inflows between 21 and 25 July, compared to just $72 million for BTC. With so many crosscurrents shaping the market, all eyes are now on the FOMC meeting and its potential ripple effects across the crypto landscape.

Title: Lions and Wallabies give the MCG the epic it deserves

Neil Treacy RTÉ Sport Journalist Think about all of the times you've seen Jerry Guscott’s drop-goal to clinch the series against the Springboks in 1997. Hugo Keenan’s try to defeat Australia in Saturday’s epic second Test at the MCG has joined a list of iconic moments in the 137-year history of the British and Irish Lions. Owen Farrell’s winning penalty in the second Test in Wellington in 2017, George North lifting Israel Folau over his shoulders and carrying him like a toddler in Brisbane in 2013, Brian O’Driscoll’s dancing feet at the Gabba in 2001. Jim Telfer’s 'This is your Everest’ speech. Add Keenan to the montage. Every four years, the sight of the Ireland and Leinster full-back hitting the gas and burning Len Ikitau to the line will be replayed again and again and again, probably with a Scott Quinnell or Ian McGeechan voiceover that would have you ready to run through walls. Sport can create unlikely heroes, and when Keenan was playing off the bench for Blackrock College’s U14 C team back in the day, never in his wildest dreams would he have imagined scoring a last-minute winner to win a British and Irish Lions series. Even a few weeks ago it would have seemed like a long shot. Having come into the tour shaking off a calf injury, his Lions debut was delayed by a gastro bug that emptied him out and left him 6kg lighter. One of the more level-headed players – even by modern rugby standards – Keenan couldn’t be contained after the final whistle, doing his best to leap into the stands of the MCG every time he spotted some of the friends and family that made their way down to the front row to meet him, including some particularly emotional moments with his parents, Paul and Avril (below). Maybe we’re biased, but on a Lions tour that was so dominated by green, it felt appropriate that one of the Irish contingent was the hero of the day. It was also appropriate that the game itself matched the setting and occasion. The Melbourne Cricket Grounds is one of the world’s iconic sporting venues, and with 90,307 people crammed into ‘The G’, we were treated to one of the all-time great Lions Tests. While the Wallabies fell 60 seconds short of bringing it to a decider in Sydney, Joe Schmidt’s side put to bed any ideas of this series being a formality. Bullied a week ago in Brisbane, they allowed the Lions win pulling up and only a sleepy final quarter at Suncorp put some respectability on that scoreboard. Last night at the MCG it was a different story. While the Lions never played with the same efficiency that marked the first half of their win a week ago, both teams played their part in a thrilling 80 minutes. All week there were fears that this game would be wasted on the occasion, but what played out was a game of rugby that delivered beyond all expectations. In the first half, Australia played with a determination and flair unrecognisable from a week ago. With Will Skelton and Rob Valetini back in their side, they used their two most powerful forwards effectively. The first two lineouts saw them manufacture touches for each player in space; first Skelton broke down the touchline off a clever short lineout, and on their second they went over the top where Valetini charged to the 22. They carried nine times each, with Valetini departing at half time as his calf injury caught up on him, while Skelton’s tank was empty early in the second half. Even with those early departures, captain Harry Wilson was the only forward who carried more. It wasn't just physically where they matched the Lions. Full-back Tom Wright was inspired in the first half, with his glorious 50:22 laying the platform for Jake Gordon’s try, before he raced clear to score one of his own almost straight from the restart, after Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii had left Bundee Aki for dead. "I suppose the drama and how it unfolded is what makes it special," Lions head coach Andy Farrell said. "We came here to win a series. To do it in that type of fashion, you wouldn’t have backed us at 23-5, but to find a way adds to the story, doesn’t it? It adds to the fairytale." Twelve years ago Farrell was part of Warren Gatland’s coaching group who were brought the distance by the Wallabies in the series, before blowing them away in the Sydney decider. "To be a part of it is an honour, it really is. 2013 was special, 1-1, and being able to win it at the death, but we won quite comfortably in the end. "To win it like that is what top level sport is all about." If any context was needed to back-up how thrilling Saturday’s game was, the numbers back it up. Keenan’s match-winner saw the Lions take the lead for the first time on the night, having trailed for 75 minutes, while no Lions side had ever come from more than 10-points down to win a Test, as highlighted by the great rugby historian Stuart Farmer. Jack Conan’s workload summed up the physical toll, with the excellent stats man Russ Petty confirming his combined 31 tackles (24) and carries (7) were the most for Lions player in a single Test across the last five series. Judging by the singing in the Lions’ changing room, which could be heard loudly from the press conference room at the MCG, there will be a physical toll to the celebrations too, and the players are set to be given a couple of days off before turning their attention to Saturday’s third Test in Sydney. With the series win complete, it’s unlikely we’ll see the intensity of the MCG repeated at Accor Stadium. But with a first 3-0 sweep against the Wallabies for more than 100 years the prize on offer, there’s incentive enough for the Lions to throw everything they have at the last week, and give the final game of this tour, and Australian rugby, the respect it deserves.

Title: Tracing the real people in Brian Friel’s ‘first great Irish play’
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/stage/2025/07/27/tracing-the-real-people-in-brian-friels-first-great-irish-play/
Time Published: 2025-07-27T05:00:00Z
Full Content:
Brian Friel had a healthy suspicion of journalists. A reporter once described how, when asked to reflect on the success of one of his plays, he did “a touching impersonation of an opossum playing dead at the approach of danger”. Still, in February 1963, when a journalist from the Belfast Telegraph caught up with him, Friel was frank about his work in progress. He was writing a play called The Ballad of Ballybeg but didn’t know if he’d ever finish it: “I have been working at it for six months and so far my characters aren’t moving.” His ambition, he added, was to write “the great Irish play”: “Such a play is one where the author can talk so truthfully and accurately about people in his own neighbourhood … so that these folks could be living in Omagh, Omaha or Omansk.” A few weeks later, the 34-year-old left for Minneapolis, where over several months as an “observer” at the Guthrie Theater he honed his craft. On his return home, he and his wife Anne took their children to the Rosses of west Donegal. And there, near Kincasslagh, which comprised little more than O’Boyle’s shop and Logue’s hotel (in truth, a bar), the Ballad of Ballybeg became Philadelphia, Here I Come! The play spans the night and morning before the emigration of Gar O’Donnell, a young man conflicted about both his imminent departure and his relationship with his emotionally inarticulate father, Screwballs, a county councillor and proprietor of a general store. Philadelphia opened at the Dublin Theatre Festival to a rapturous reception in September 1964. It moved to Broadway in 1966, where it ran for 324 performances and won several Tony Awards, including that for Best Play. Friel had written his first “great Irish play”. Philadelphia was the first play Friel set in “Ballybeg”. Among the others are Translations (1980) and his best-loved work, Dancing at Lughnasa (1990), whose run at Dublin’s 3Olympia finishes this weekend. And because of the symmetry between Lughnasa’s characters and the lives of his mother’s people in Glenties, there is a tendency to assume “Ballybeg” represents that southwest Donegal town. But then, as Friel intimated to the Belfast Telegraph, Ballybeg is Anywhere. Well, it is Anywhere – and it is not. In Philadelphia, for instance, the stage directions for the shopkeeper-cum-county councillor’s entrance are as follows: “SB appears at the shop door. He is in his late 60s. Wears a hat, a good dark suit, collar and tie, black apron. SB O’DONNELL is a responsible, respectable citizen.” In notes on characters in an early draft, Friel remarks of Screwballs: “Aged in his 60s. Hat. Daniel E O’Boyle.” It is a clear reference to Daniel E O’Boyle (1873–1958), the proprietor of the general store in Kincasslagh, who was a county councillor from 1925 through 1950, and who, just like Screwballs, had a younger wife. Daniel E O’Boyle died in 1958. However, at least one other character in Philadelphia was based on somebody who was alive in the 1960s: Master Boyle, who drops into Screwball’s to say goodbye to Gar. And to rant about the priest trying to get him fired: “Enter MASTER BOYLE from the scullery. He is around 60, white-haired, handsome, defiant. He is shabbily dressed; his eyes, head, hands, arms are constantly moving – he sits for a moment and rises again – he puts his hands in his pockets and takes them out again – his eyes roam around the room but see nothing.” Boyle has a gift for Gar, a volume of his poems: “I had them printed privately last month.” Public Gar appears genuinely touched. But Private Gar, his alter ego, who has been sneering at Master Boyle, is dismissive: “He’s nothing but a drunken aul schoolmaster – a conceited, arrogant washout.” Master Boyle may seem a stock character. Indeed, in 1966 Friel himself said: “All my characters are the stock ones of Irish plays … I use the stock people and then have to make something of them.” Still, young fellows who rocketed from the west of Ireland to college in bright cities sometimes burned up on re-entry. And if the drunken schoolmaster with frustrated ambitions was a stock character in Irish literature, he was a familiar figure in many small towns. In an early draft Friel named the person who was in his mind’s eye when conjuring Master Boyle: “The local teacher Dominick Kelly, brilliant, mad, touting his book of privately printed poems; years ago he urged Gar to ‘clear out’ and now that Gar is escaping the teacher turns mean through jealousy.” Dominic Ó Ceallaigh or O’Kelly (1900–70) was once considered “brilliant” and he was what people in the 1960s called “mad”. The son of schoolmaster, he trained for the priesthood, studying in Rome in 1915–18, but abandoned the idea after completing a degree in Philosophy. Returning to Ireland, he joined the IRA. A severe beating from Black and Tans left him deaf in one ear. After the Civil War, in which he took the anti-Treaty side, he taught in various schools in Dublin, including stints in Belvedere and Blackrock, before becoming principal of Finglas National School and then, in 1930, principal in Rush. In 1933, he left Rush to become principal of Dungloe National School, settling in Kincasslagh, where his wife Úna, herself a teacher, was appointed to a position in the local school. Úna O’Kelly (née Turner) was a native of Gortalowry, CoTyrone, where she had been taught by Friel’s aunt, Kate MacLoone. [ Anne Friel on her late husband playwright Brian: ‘I was crazy about him. He was everything’Opens in new window ] O’Kelly was active in Fianna Fáil, attending ardfheiseanna as a constituency delegate. Indeed, he was master of ceremonies in 1937 at a Fianna Fáil Aeraíocht, cultural festival, on Narin Strand when eight-year-old Brian Friel was among the performers. And then things came undone. On the morning of July 17th 1939, O’Kelly left Kincasslagh on the mail car to go to his school in Dungloe – it was the holidays – and when he arrived home at 4.45pm he clearly had drink taken. He took his dinner, and then at 6.00pm said was going to get the paper at Daniel E O’Boyle’s, a stone’s throw from the house. After 15 minutes there, he crossed the road to Logue’s. On arrival home at 10.00pm, “very drunk”, he picked a row with his wife when he was unable to tune the wireless. Then he viciously attacked her, punching and kicking her unconscious. A priest was called to administer the last rites to her. According to court records, O’Kelly called him a “baldy-headed bastard” and ordered him out of the house. Arrested in Belcruit on July 24th, O’Kelly was removed to Sligo Gaol and brought to court three days later, charged with inflicting grievous bodily harm on his wife and indecently assaulting one of the maids, a young girl. A trial date was set for mid-October and O’Kelly remanded in custody. However, on August 17th he was released on bail to Letterkenny Asylum. In October, a doctor testified in court that he was unfit to plead: “He was suffering from a certain amount of depression and confusion, and a certain amount of loss of memory.” Press reports at the time show the judge ruled O’Kelly was “not of sound mind” and returned him to the asylum. There he remained until February 1941, when a jury deemed him sane. He now pleaded guilty to three charges relating to the assault on his wife; the indecent assault charge had been dropped. The judge sentenced him to three months in Sligo Gaol. Úna O’Kelly, meanwhile, moved with their children to Ramelton, north Donegal, where her brother Seán was an established solicitor, and resumed her teaching career. By 1943, Dominic O’Kelly was back teaching, at the Prior School, a Protestant secondary school, in Lifford. He taught there until 1948, when he returned to primary teaching in CoSligo as principal of St John’s Well and then, in 1950, of Geevagh, a three-teacher school, moving a few years later to Claremorris, Co Mayo. After a car hit him in 1959, he retired early to Downings, north Donegal. O’Kelly knew no shame. Since his release from prison, he had been a regular contributor of verse to the regional press, especially the Derry Journal. In 1960 he published, like Master Boyle, a collection of his poetry, Sky, Sea, Sod. It was available from the printer, the Donegal Democrat, and from himself for 10 shillings and sixpence. His short introduction alludes to his “undermined career” and there is a marked note of grievance in several poems, notably the 30-verse “Death by Despair (How a Man Might Die in a Mental Hospital)”, which includes his self-pitying account of his attack on his wife. [ ‘Glenties is the stage’: Brian Friel’s DonegalOpens in new window ] Dominic O’Kelly died in 1970. An obituary in the Derry Journal lamented the passing of a man of “giant intellect”, a “most lovable and entertaining character”, and a “poet of outstanding genius”. Preceding it on the very same page was an interview with Friel on plans to make a film of Philadelphia. Friel alone likely got the irony. The solicitor who represented O’Kelly in 1939–41 was Pa O’Donnell (1907–70) of Burtonport, a UCD-educated lawyer, who was subsequently a Fine Gael TD (1949–70) and minister for local government (1954–57). Although not mentioned by name in Friel’s drafts, might O’Donnell have been the model for the UCD-educated Senator Doogan in Philadelphia? Perhaps. Certainly, other Rosses notables inspired characters in Friel’s “Ballybeg” plays. In a draft of Translations, for instance, Friel describes the Ballybeg hedge-schoolmaster as “a kind of dissipated Eunan O’Donnell”. Eunan O’Donnell (1923–99), who had an MA in Classics, had established a fee-paying secondary school in Dungloe in 1956. And when free education was introduced, and it was decreed that Dungloe was to have a vocational school, with an emphasis on the trades, not a secondary school, with an emphasis on academic subjects, he left to teach in Gonzaga in Dublin. In the play, Hugh O’Donnell, the Greek- and Latin-speaking hedge-schoolmaster is uncomfortable with the incoming national schools. He remembers, how, in 1798, he and Jimmy Jack, a 60-year-old who knew the classics and not much else, had marched, with the Aeneid in their pockets, before getting drunk in Phelan’s pub in Glenties. There, overcome by the desiderium nostrorum (the need for our own), they resolved to march home. “And that was the longest 23 miles back I ever made.” Glenties, before the road was straightened in recent years, was 23 miles from Kincasslagh. So Ballybeg isn’t Glenties any more, Toto, it is Kincasslagh? No, Dorothy: Ballybeg is Anywhere, but populated in Philadelphia and Translations with characters modelled on people in the Rosses where Brian Friel holidayed from the 1950s. Breandán Mac Suibhne is a historian at the University of Galway. He is writing a book on the individuals on whom the characters in Dancing at Lughnasa are based. A new 35th anniversary production of Dancing at Lughnasa opens as part of FrielDays - A Homecoming on August 1st at St Columba’s Comprehensive School in Glenties, near the house in which was play was set. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

It also strengthens the U.S. national security posture and global economic influence. Most importantly, it will pave the way for American hegemony in the AI era.Chris Talgo ([email protected]) is editorial director at The Heartland Institute.

Massive data centers also require oodles of energy.“These AI data centers are going to require more power than anything we could ever have imagined. We at the G7 do not have enough power,” said BlackRock CEO Larry Fink last year.From Mark Zuckerberg to Elon Musk and many more, there is a similar consensus among Silicon Valley’s leaders that AI will necessitate a huge increase in demand for dependable and affordable energy.In order to meet this forthcoming rapid increase in demand for reliable and affordable energy, it is absolutely essential that the United States pursues what Trump calls “energy dominance.”A few months ago, Trump established the National Energy Dominance Council, which aims to “expand energy production and address cost barriers.”RELATED: Trump Admin to Announce Big, Beautiful News in AI InvestmentsTrump Holds Post-Certification Press Conference, Announces Huge New Investment in Data CentersDuring his first term, Trump made great strides in unleashing American energy. However, most of those successful policies were rejected by President Biden, who then went all-in on the so-called green energy transition.This created a skewed energy market that subsidized unaffordable and unreliable power via solar panels and windmills to the detriment of conventional energy sources that are much more affordable, reliable, and cleaner.Fortunately, President Trump recognizes the sheer folly of the green transition. For years, he has rightfully pointed out that solar panels and windmills are not actually friendly to the environment, unless you ignore the facts that they destroy pristine lands, disrupt ecosystems and habitats, are nearly impossible to recycle, and result in the mass killing of birds, whales, and other animals.So far, Trump has delivered on his campaign promises to eliminate the “Green New Scam.” In a little more than six months, he has already taken the United States out of the Paris Climate Agreement (again), signed a bevy of executive orders to accelerate the domestic production of coal, oil and natural gas, and signed into law the reconciliation bill, which eliminated many of the outrageous subsidies that have kept the green energy industry afloat for decades.Moreover, Trump has assembled an all-star team of energy officials who are climate realists.

However, most of those successful policies were rejected by President Biden, who then went all-in on the so-called green energy transition.This created a skewed energy market that subsidized unaffordable and unreliable power via solar panels and windmills to the detriment of conventional energy sources that are much more affordable, reliable, and cleaner.Fortunately, President Trump recognizes the sheer folly of the green transition. For years, he has rightfully pointed out that solar panels and windmills are not actually friendly to the environment, unless you ignore the facts that they destroy pristine lands, disrupt ecosystems and habitats, are nearly impossible to recycle, and result in the mass killing of birds, whales, and other animals.So far, Trump has delivered on his campaign promises to eliminate the “Green New Scam.” In a little more than six months, he has already taken the United States out of the Paris Climate Agreement (again), signed a bevy of executive orders to accelerate the domestic production of coal, oil and natural gas, and signed into law the reconciliation bill, which eliminated many of the outrageous subsidies that have kept the green energy industry afloat for decades.Moreover, Trump has assembled an all-star team of energy officials who are climate realists. From Energy Secretary Chris Wright to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, the days of climate alarmism driving federal policy are long gone.Americans should rejoice at this development. Going forward, Trump’s energy dominance agenda will keep prices at the pump low and utility bills less exorbitant. It also strengthens the U.S. national security posture and global economic influence. Most importantly, it will pave the way for American hegemony in the AI era.Chris Talgo ([email protected]) is editorial director at The Heartland Institute.

For years, he has rightfully pointed out that solar panels and windmills are not actually friendly to the environment, unless you ignore the facts that they destroy pristine lands, disrupt ecosystems and habitats, are nearly impossible to recycle, and result in the mass killing of birds, whales, and other animals.So far, Trump has delivered on his campaign promises to eliminate the “Green New Scam.” In a little more than six months, he has already taken the United States out of the Paris Climate Agreement (again), signed a bevy of executive orders to accelerate the domestic production of coal, oil and natural gas, and signed into law the reconciliation bill, which eliminated many of the outrageous subsidies that have kept the green energy industry afloat for decades.Moreover, Trump has assembled an all-star team of energy officials who are climate realists. From Energy Secretary Chris Wright to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, the days of climate alarmism driving federal policy are long gone.Americans should rejoice at this development.

Experts are calling the next boom a Bitcoin treasury bubble that could rival the dot-com era, with $11 trillion of institutional capital on the sidelines and a possible path to $1 million BTC. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Bitcoin’s quiet rally has captured the attention of Wall Street and beyond, but some voices from OG Bitcoiners like American HODL are predicting that what we’ve witnessed so far is just the calm before an explosive storm. The Bitcoin treasury bubble thesis is that, within just a few years, a tidal wave of corporate, institutional, and possibly sovereign capital totaling as much as $11 trillion could flood into Bitcoin. Some projections suggest that true mania may not hit until 2026 or beyond, potentially sending the price as high as $1 million per coin. Swan Bitcoin exchange unpacked this thesis, examining the signals, mechanics, and real-world examples supporting the case for a Bitcoin treasury bubble that could rival the wildest days of the dot-com boom. Let’s check it out. This month, Bitcoin marked a new all-time high above $120,000, pushing its market cap to $2.4 trillion, trailing only behind Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and gold. Yet, this move has come with little public awareness or euphoria. The price has stair-stepped higher in a quiet fashion, led not by retail speculation but by deliberate, low-profile corporate and institutional buying. As Swan pointed out: “This is the least euphoric bull market we’ve ever seen… and that’s bullish.” Public companies ranging from Strategy to Metaplanet, GameStop to Trump Media are accumulating Bitcoin on their balance sheets, and more novel models, such as those pioneered by Strive Asset Management, see companies converting cash reserves to Bitcoin, not for speculation but as an inflation hedge and long-term holding. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon recently warned that if the U.S. can’t rein in ballooning debt, America might lose its stance as the world’s reserve asset. He said: “I just don’t know if it’s going to be a crisis in six months or six years, and I’m hoping that we change both the trajectory of the debt and the ability of market makers to make markets. Unfortunately, it may be that we need that to wake us up.” As of fiscal year 2025, U.S. debt interest payments are projected to reach $952 billion, and as the dollar loses luster, Bitcoin’s narrative as “digital gold” and a reserve asset strengthens. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink echoed Dimon’s concerns, saying: “If the U.S. doesn’t get its debt under control, if deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin.” The bond market is pricing in interest rate cuts, suggesting a potential return to “easy money” conditions as early as 2026. Lower rates mean cheap capital, more risk-on sentiment, and historically, a surge in asset prices, including Bitcoin. As Swan observed: “Bitcoin ran from $42K → $123K during the tightest monetary policy in modern history. What happens when liquidity floods back in?” Remember the lockdown era? When rate cuts during the COVID-19 pandemic spurred rally after rally across crypto markets, culminating in parabolic gains for Bitcoin? With another cycle of rate slashing potentially on the horizon, the setup looks eerily similar. According to Swan, big buyers are still mostly on the sidelines, finalizing mergers and legal structures. Names like Nakamoto, Twenty One Capital, and Strive Asset Management have yet to fully deploy capital, but are preparing multi-billion-dollar mandates. As coins are absorbed by corporate treasuries through algorithmic “drip-buying,” available supply dries up without dramatic price spikes. When enough boardrooms and sovereigns hit “bid” at the same time, price action could turn “reflexive” where buying by one entity triggers more entities to chase Bitcoin, echoing the late-’90s scramble for “internet stories.” Just like every dot-com needed an “internet story” to survive in 1999, every major firm may soon feel pressure to have a “Bitcoin strategy.” This “narrative contagion” can push prices to unimaginable heights (well beyond what fundamentals alone would suggest). American HODL, among others, sees a realistic path: “I think the treasury company bubble can get dot-com level large. We could see a 3–4 year run that takes Bitcoin well beyond a million dollars.” This isn’t isolated. BitMEX’s Arthur Hayes and long-term Bitcoin advocate Mark Moss also projected a $1,000,000 BTC by 2030. So is it plausible that we’re seeing the opening moves of a bubble that could rival the dot-com era? The pieces are falling into place. Mania may yet be a year or two away, but if history rhymes, the blow-off top could take Bitcoin to levels few believed possible just a few years ago.

Title: Ethereum ETFs Outpacing Bitcoin? BlackRock’s ETHA Hits $10B Benchmark

BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust has raced past a major mark. It now holds $10 billion in assets, just one year after launch. That pace makes it the fastest non‑Bitcoin ETF to hit that level and the third‑fastest ETF overall in US history. ETHA’s rapid popularity also may lead to more competition. Other issuers will be watching closely to see if staking approval gives ETHA a leg up on the competition. Lower cost fees or competing custodians may change their offerings to remain competitive. Investors will be comparing fee schedules, custodial arrangements, and staking opportunities as they place their Ether. LOOK OUT: $ETHA just hit $10b in one year flat, the 3rd fastest ETF to hit that mark in history after (you guessed it) two bitcoin ETFs $IBIT & $FBTC. Amazingly it went from $5b to $10b in just 10 days (ETF asset equiv of a God candle). Is in Top 5 in flows 1M, 1W. Sister Hazel! pic.twitter.com/Jrrb15BdHV — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 24, 2025 Ethereum ETFs are moving quickly. Latest data shows they drew nearly $5 billion in monthly inflows overall. On July 17 alone, Ethereum funds saw $602 million net injections. At the same time, Bitcoin ETFs brought in over $520 million. That shift hints at growing confidence in Ethereum’s role beyond simple currency use. ETHA’s sponsor fee of 0.25% is low enough to attract big players. Based on reports, BlackRock set it up with Coinbase Prime as custodian after filing in November 2023. The US Securities and Exchange Commission approved spot Ethereum ETFs alongside seven other funds early in 2024. That green light opened the door for major institutional flows. Analysts point to Ethereum’s proof‑of‑stake system and its DeFi applications as key drivers. Staking locks up Ether and earns rewards, offering a potential yield that Bitcoin funds can’t match. BlackRock has applied to let ETHA stake its holdings. If approved, some of ETHA’s Ethereum will be locked up to generate staking income. That decision could come later this year after the SEC clarified that staking rewards count as income, not a security. Ethereum’s rise also reflects a broader search for yield. With bond returns still low and stock markets volatile, some investors are turning to crypto products that offer returns beyond price gains. ETHA’s quick growth shows that institutional demand for crypto is no longer limited to Bitcoin. Based on reports, ETHA ranks first among spot Ethereum ETFs in both size and growth rate. BlackRock’s deep pockets and respected brand do not hurt either. A large brand like BlackRock has clout when it comes to working with highly regulated assets. With Ethereum now being seen as a broader-than-niche token, large asset managers see a chance to add crypto to mainstream portfolios.

Title: XRP Price Set To Teleport As Major Financial Players Tap In — Opportunity Window Closing Fast

The XRP price is already looking at a rapid move after the market decline that rocked the altcoin in the last few days. This comes amid expectations of a Spot XRP ETF, as well as a move by Ripple to sweep in and take a bite out of SWIFT’s market share. As one XRP analyst puts it, the altcoin is already set for takeoff, and the only thing left now is for it to trigger a face-melting rally. Crypto researcher and XRP community member Ripple Van Winkle has sounded the alarm for investors for what could be coming next for the altcoin. In a video posted on X, Van Winkle explains that the teal XRP move was yet to happen, and what was seen before was only a preview of what was yet to come. He pointed to a number of factors that are set to drive the XRP price higher, including larger institutional players looking to tap into the altcoin. The analyst mentioned that the likes of BlackRock, Fidelity, and PNC, among others, are already circling, especially as XRP ETFs become more popular over time. These trillion-dollar players are expected to possibly jump on the bandwagon once XRP begins receiving ETF approvals from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Due to this, the researcher believes that the XRP price has not even started to move. In fact, he explains that the ‘real move’ is actually ‘encoded into the system.’ This move, he explains, is not going to be a gradual move for the market. But rather, he expects the price to expand rapidly during this time. Ahead of this expected move, Van Winkle has urged XRP investors to hang tight. For those who are still holding their coins, he suggests continuous holding and faith in the altcoin for a move that he says will hit like a freight train and catch everyone off guard. As for those who are yet to invest in the altcoin, the crypto researcher explains that they have only a small window of opportunity to get into the cryptocurrency before it takes off. He expects the move to make instant millionaires of investors when it eventually happens. In his post, he points to things like pre-programmed liquidity and institutional ETFs as things that will drive the rally. According to Van Winkle, there is going to be a reset that will cause the XRP price to teleport to possibly new all-time highs. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.
