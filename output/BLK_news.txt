Shares of crypto exchange Bullish (BLSH) soared as high as $102 in initial trades on Wednesday, their first day of action on the New York Stock Exchange before closing at $68. The company priced its initial public offering (IPO) at $37 per share, above the expected $32 to $33 range. That price valued the Cayman Island-based crypto exchange at a total market value of $5.4 billion. Bullish, which is the owner of CoinDesk, earlier this week expanded the amount of shares it sold in its IPO to 20.3 million as investor appetite turned out to be larger than anticipated. Both BlackRock and Ark Investment Management had expressed interest to buy up to $200 million worth of shares. “The last leg of growth in crypto in the last 10 years was basically all retail and if you look now, the institutional wave has begun, it’s here, it’s a question of how big it will be,” Bullish CEO Tom Farley said in an interview with CNBC. Unlike retail-focused exchanges such as Coinbase or Kraken, Bullish targets institutional investors seeking exposure to digital assets while relying on the oversight and safeguards of a centralized platform. The exchange saw trading volume of over $1.25 trillion as of March 31, since its launch in 2021, according to a filing. “Bullish's $1.1 billion IPO raise reflects growing institutional confidence in the crypto exchange sector, driven by a favorable regulatory environment under the Trump administration and Bitcoin's surge past $100,000,” said Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research. “This success, alongside Circle's strong IPO performance, signals that institutional investors are increasingly viewing centralized exchanges as viable long-term investments. However, sustained confidence will depend on regulatory clarity and market stability,” he said. The company’s debut comes at a time of booming interest in crypto-related projects, specifically from Wall Street, as U.S. regulators are getting close to a regulatory framework for the space, allowing participants to engage in a safe way.

Title: ‘Well worth viewing’: Perseid meteor shower to continue Wednesday night
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/science/space/2025/08/13/well-worth-viewing-perseid-meteor-shower-to-continue-wednesday-night/
Time Published: 2025-08-13T16:38:54Z
Full Content:
One of the most eagerly awaited astronomical events of the year – which promised one or two meteors or “shooting stars” a minute – is set to continue in Irish skies on Wednesday night. Tuesday night saw about 60 meteors an hour darting across the sky and stargazers can expect about half that amount on Wednesday night. “The Perseids will be half as strong tonight as they were last night, so that’s still 10 times more meteors tonight than a normal night, so well worth viewing,” said David Moore from astronomy.ie. “The best time to view is dusk until dawn,” he said. “We had people sending us counts of how many they saw every 15 minutes from 10:30pm last night when it got dark enough to see them. I saw some after 4am when dawn was breaking.” “Dublin gets much the same view as the rest of the country, indeed, all of Europe,” Mr Moore said. “This year the moon is in the sky so even those in the countryside will have moonlit skies so even suburban viewers will get the same view.” Met Éireann has forecast a humid night with clear spells on Wednesday, however a few showers are possible which could be heavy or thundery. Mr Moore advised stargazers to ensure they are comfortable while looking up. “Standing with your neck craned back for hours is not comfortable. “Look anywhere in the sky. If there are clouds look in the clear patches. If totally clear stand with your back to the moon so it does not dazzle you,” he said. “The paths of the meteors will all point back to the constellation Perseus but you do not have to look at Perseus.” The Perseid meteors are caused by dust particles shed by the comet Swift-Tuttle. The comet, which takes 133 years to orbit the sun, was last seen in Irish skies in 1992. At this time of year, Earth moves through this debris cloud, making one of the most celebrated astronomical events and arguably the most predictable. Particles from the debris cloud subsequently burn up on entering Earth’s atmosphere and create flashes of light. The shower is active for several weeks. “It’s such a special time of the year,” said astronomer Danielle Wilcox from Blackrock Castle Observatory, Cork. “It’s a really good meteor shower in particular because it gives us a lot of meteors per hour compared to other meteor showers,” she said. “That’s what’s so exciting about it, especially for people who have never seen ‘shooting stars’, this is your chance to get out there and see that,” she said. “Take some time to look up,” she said.

Title: Applebee’s and IHOP’s CIO places AI bets that can boost traffic and improve the dining experience
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/08/13/applebees-and-ihops-cio-places-ai-bets-that-can-boost-traffic-and-improve-the-dining-experience/
Time Published: 2025-08-13T16:06:47Z
Full Content:
John Kell is a contributing writer for Fortune and author of Fortune’s CIO Intelligence newsletter. Justin Skelton, the chief information officer at Dine Brands, envisions a world in the not-too-distant future where an IHOP server can scan a QR code and pull up every detail about a guest’s order preferences and history. Using generative AI to guide them, servers can then suggest the perfect side dishes to complement that order of pancakes and sausage. This AI-powered “recommendation engine,” which utilizes Google Cloud’s recommendations AI technology, is already in production for online orders at the restaurant operator’s IHOP and Applebee’s chains and will also roll out soon at Dine’s Fuzzy’s Taco Shop. It blends together a guest’s past order history with the buying patterns from a broader pool of similar diners to generate more personalized menu pairings. But there could be even greater opportunities for targeted, in-person upselling when the technology could be deployed across the chain’s 3,5000 brick-and-mortar restaurants. “There’s a lot of new technologies we’re looking at that we want to bring to the market,” says Skelton, who has served as CIO at Dine since 2019, after prior technology leadership roles at CVS Health, Bank of America, and Allstate. Skelton says that all of his generative AI bets are intended to support three outcomes: boost revenue and traffic, improve the guest experience, and bolster worker productivity. Because he runs a small IT team, Skelton says he has to be very careful about his technology bets. “We’re not prepared to go and invest in and hire a lot of people,” says Skelton. With that in mind, Dine tends to partner and “buy” more solutions from vendors rather than build. Skelton relies on large AI companies like Google and Amazon and non-hyperscalers like IT consulting firm Cognizant. The latter helped Dine create and launch an AI Innovation Foundry last fall, a virtual lab that is led by Skelton’s IT team and works with different stakeholder groups including legal and finance to test emerging AI technologies. Initially only available for corporate employees, the Foundry became so appetizing that franchise partners have also been encouraged to submit use cases for Dine’s team to vet. “There’s a recognition that not all ideas are going to make it and see the light of day,” says Skelton. “It’s really sort of a way we can incubate.” With budget planning for 2026 already under way, Skelton and his team will mull the proposed use cases and a steering committee will determine the few select projects that will get capital allocation. Some newer concepts that Dine is considering include AI-enabled tools that can make it easier for the general manager to understand their staffing levels, inventory, and other data needed to make a restaurant run smoothly and utilize that real-time data to make better decisions. Another is an evolution of Dine’s generative AI assistant tool that guides the company’s franchise technology services team, a group of technicians that resolves issues like when a printer breaks or a point of sale system is down at a restaurant. In the future, Dine hopes to make this a self-service tool, allowing franchisees to access Dine’s technician data to solve some of their own problems. Investments in AI to improve back office functions, demand forecasting, and predicting the appropriate staffing level for any given day are all efforts that can bolster the bottom line. That’s especially critical in the restaurant industry, which operates on notoriously thin margins. For customer-facing applications of AI, many restaurant chains have prioritized AI-enabled recommendation tools that are flourishing online. Chains like Taco Bell, McDonald’s, and Wendy’s have all deployed or tested AI-enabled drive-thru technologies to varying degrees of success. There is also a fine line that casual-dining chains like Dine must balance when adding technology—a playbook that differs from fast-food operators like McDonald’s and Burger King. At those chains, guests often prioritize the speed of service, which has fueled the popularity of ordering kiosks in recent years. But at Applebee’s or IHOP, diners crave a more personal connection. “There’s still that human touch and that human interaction that cannot be replaced with technology,” says Skelton. “But it can be enhanced, without a question, and we’ve got to figure out how to get that right.” John Kell Send thoughts or suggestions to CIO Intelligence here. The AI talent war continues to intensify. A lot of new media reports have homed in on the aggressively expensive AI talent war, including a piece from The Wall Street Journal that cites research showing that Anthropic’s retention rate is higher than rivals OpenAI, Meta, and Google. The Financial Times reports that Apple has been losing AI staff to rivals throughout the year while Business Insider says that Elon Musk’s xAI has hired 14 AI researchers and engineers from Meta since January. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, commenting on the marketplace in a recent interview with CNBC, says this is “the most intense talent market I have seen in my career.” He adds that the compensation packages will be especially intense for “a very small number of people right now.” The New York Times reports that pay packages for the most elite talent is rivaling that of NBA stars like LeBron James and Steph Curry. GPT-5's bumpy debut. Last week, OpenAI launched a new version of its flagship product, GPT-5, which the company says delivers “more accurate answers than any previous reasoning model,” and is less prone to hallucinations than previous models, has better coding functionality, scores higher to offer medical health advice, and integrates with Gmail and Google Calendar for agentic capabilities. But the product's "real-time model router"—which automatically decides which one of GPT-5’s several variants is best suited for each particular job—sparked a user backlash. While the router was designed to save users from the hassle of manually pickings models, many users bristled at the lack of control. Still, as Fortune's Sharon Goldman reports, these model routers may be the future of AI. Nvidia, AMD strike deal for export licenses in China. American chip makers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD is the sponsor of this newsletter) have agreed to pay 15% of their revenue from Chinese AI chip sales to the U.S. government, an unusual arrangement that Bloomberg reports may set a new precedent for U.S. companies that seek to do business in China. Nvidia announced its plans to share 15% of the revenue of the company’s H20 AI accelerator in China, according to President Donald Trump in a briefing with reporters on Monday, while AMD’s deal was reported by Bloomberg, citing a person familiar with the matter. Separately on the chips front, Trump last week demanded the resignation of Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, following a request from Republican Sen. Tom Cotton for more information about Tan’s ties to Chinese companies. After Tan met with Trump on Monday though, the POTUS said he would be spending more time working things out with Tan, whose career he pronounced an "amazing story." Nearly half of developers don’t trust the accuracy of AI tools. An international survey of over 49,000 developers found that a lack of trust is growing in AI tools even as the use of these tools proliferates in the development process. 46% of developers say they don’t trust the accuracy of the output of AI tools, a big increase from 31% in last year’s survey, which was conducted by developer question-and-answer website Stack Overflow. Other notable nuggets from the study include that a majority of developers still aren’t using AI agents (only 31% are doing so). The large language models that are used by most developers are OpenAI’s GPT models (81%), Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet models (43%), and Google’s Gemini Flash models (35%). When it comes to technologists and their evolving approach to work, 66% of developers say they spent time in the last year learning new coding techniques or a new programming language and 44% have turned to AI tools to learn how to code, up from 37% last year. But “vibe coding,” a buzzy new practice of writing code with AI using natural language prompts, still isn’t embraced by most. Nearly 77% say they aren’t vibe coding for their professional work.

Title: BlackRock's $2.4 trillion money manager says the market is in the most bullish investing environment ever
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-outlook-sp500-investing-blackrock-rick-rieder-2025-8
Time Published: 2025-08-13T14:14:23Z
Full Content:
For Rick Rieder, the stock market has never looked so good. The chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock says he thinks the market has emerged into the "best investing environment ever," thanks to a cluster of factors that are setting up a bullish backdrop for equities. Rieder's ultra-bullish view isn't shared by all. Concerns about the US economy and the impact of tariffs have caused the percentage of investors who said they were bearish on stocks over the next six months to rise to 43% in the last week, according to the latest AAII Investor Sentiment survey. But for Rieder, who manages $2.4 trillion of client money, the setup right now is ideal. "It doesn't mean necessarily that everything's going up, but there's a couple of things at play that are pretty extraordinary," Rieder told CNBC on Wednesday. Here's what's driving his optimism. The technical backdrop for equities is highly favorable. Investors have around $7 trillion of cash sidelined in money market fund, which some have said could fuel fresh gains for stocks as rates come down in the coming months and that money is deployed into equities. Corporate stock buybacks are also at record highs. That's setting up an excellent supply-demand picture for the market, Rieder said. "Technicals in equities are crazy," Rieder said. "The demand versus supply is pretty extraordinary. " Corporate earnings are still holding up despite pressure from tariffs. Of the the S&P 500 companies that have reported results for the second quarter, 81% have beaten earnings estimates, above the 10-year average, according to the latest update from FactSet. If that proportion of earnings beats holds, it will mark the best earnings season for the benchmark index since 2023, BlackRock said in a recent note. Earnings strength also applies to some of the market's most popular stocks. If you exclude Tesla from the Magnificent Seven, earnings growth among the group of tech stalwarts is growing at a pace of around 54% year-over-year, Rieder said. At that rate, Rieder said Big Tech stocks' high valuations aren't greatly concerning. The Fed has room to start cutting interest rates again in September, and potentially more aggressively than markets expect, Rieder said, pointing to two catalysts in particular: Rieder said he believed it was "a given" that the Fed would issue its next rate cut in September. He also speculated that the central bank had room to lower interest rates a full percentage point from the current levels, which would imply the Fed funds rate target range falling to its lowest level in about three years. Productivity growth could also rise, Rieder said, pointing to advancements in tech, space, data, and spending on AI in particular. "All of these are geared towards higher productivity, operating at a lower cost basis. That's where we're going," Rieder said of recent tech trends. Higher productivity implies steeper economic growth overall, though labor productivity among all workers actually declined over the last year. The total output among all nonfarm workers dropped to around 1.3% year-over-year growth in the second quarter, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. "I'm sanguine on the economy. I think we're moving generally in the right direction," Rieder later added. Jump to

Lara Rizério Agências de notícias 13/08/2025 09h31 13/08/2025 09h31 Publicidade O governo do presidente dos Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, está avaliando 11 candidatos para substituir o chair do Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, quando seu mandato expirar em maio de 2026, informou a CNBC nesta quarta-feira, citando dois funcionários do governo. Os novos nomes incluem David Zervos, estrategista-chefe de mercado da Jefferies, Larry Lindsey, ex-governador do Fed, e Rick Rieder, diretor de investimentos de renda fixa global da BlackRock. Eles agora se juntam a uma lista de outros oito candidatos que a CNBC confirmou estarem sob consideração, incluindo a vice-presidente de Supervisão do Fed, Michelle Bowman, o governador do Fed, Chris Waller, e o vice-presidente do Fed, Philip Jefferson. As autoridades também confirmaram que entre os candidatos estão Marc Summerlin, assessor econômico do governo Bush, a presidente do Fed de Dallas, Lorie Logan, e o ex-presidente do Fed de St. Louis, James Bullard. Saiba em 1 minuto quanto seu dinheiro pode render “Incapacidade de compreender conceitos básicos” e “disposição de induzir a erro” são como alguns economistas caracterizam E.J. Antoni, que pode chefiar o Departamento de Estatísticas de Trabalho dos EUA Lula havia dito que não vai telefonar para Trump para negociar a tarifa de 50% imposta sobre produtos brasileiros por considerar que Trump não quer conversar, mas que iria ligar para convidá-lo para a cúpula climática O presidente Trump disse recentemente à CNBC, em uma entrevista, que Kevin Hassett, diretor do Conselho Econômico Nacional, e o ex-governador do Fed, Kevin Warsh, estavam entre os indicados em sua lista. As autoridades descreveram um “processo deliberativo” em que o secretário do Tesouro, Scott Bessent, entrevistará todos os candidatos, selecionará os candidatos e encaminhará a lista final ao presidente para sua decisão. O tamanho da lista e o processo descrito sugerem que uma decisão não é iminente e pode levar um tempo considerável, mas as autoridades não ofereceram um cronograma. Continua depois da publicidade Quanto mais longo o processo, menor a probabilidade de haver um “presidente sombra do Fed” no cargo por vários meses antes da saída de Powell, o que alguns sugeriram que seria prejudicial à política monetária. Embora critique Powell com frequência quase diária, o presidente Trump recuou das sugestões de que poderia substituir o presidente do Fed antes do final de seu mandato em maio.

Title: Ethereum Returns to $4,600 After 4 Years—Time to Buy the Best ERC-20 Tokens?

Time Published: 2025-08-13T08:27:55Z

Happy days are here again for Ethereum ($ETH) and its investors as the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency broke the $4,600 mark. This brings $ETH to a level unseen since late 2021. Institutional investors and Ethereum ETFs have primarily driven the rally that began earlier this month. This bullish sentiment will also have a positive impact on the wider market and top ERC-20 tokens like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) and Snorter Token ($SNORT) as traders seek to diversify their investments. Growing appetite for $ETH has driven its price since the beginning of August, resulting in a record number of inflows on Monday of over $1B, based on data from SoSo Value. BlackRock has been one of the biggest winners so far, after its iShares Ethereum Trust ETF reportedly accounted for $640M of these inflows. But investors aren’t done buying $ETH just yet. On Monday, SharpLink Gaming announced a raise of $400M to growing its $ETH holdings to over $3B. Meanwhile, BitMine Immersion also expanded its Ethereum stash in a single week from 833,137 to its current holdings of over 1,150,263. This further extends the company’s lead as the biggest owner of $ETH and the third-biggest in DAT (total value of digital assets held). This flurry of activity has resulted in a 27.36% increase in Ethereum’s value in just seven days. It’s also been up by 6.93% in the last 24 hours, and is currently trading at $4,623. As Ethereum returns to its late 2021 levels, we can already expect traders to look for other investments to put their money in. ERC-20 tokens are potential winners too, especially Ethereum crypto presales. They’re typically very cheap and offer a huge growth potential, making them extremely attractive to investors. Here are three worth considering: There’s no denying that Bitcoin remains king, as it continues to attract institutional investors like Strategy, which now holds 628,946 Bitcoins, valued at $75B. You’re looking at a future Bitcoin Layer 2, which will improve transaction speed and lower the fees, while also expanding the crypto’s utility according to modern demands. The key to this is the Canonical Bridge that will let you send $BTC from Layer 1 to Layer 2 as wrapped $BTC. The latter is a high-speed environment powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), which enables fast transactions and low fees while keeping Bitcoin’s robust security intact. You only need to deposit $BTC to get started. The system will verify and mint wrapped $BTC on the Layer 2. This will allow you to use this wrapped $BTC for staking, trading, and interacting with dApps—things that aren’t possible with Bitcoin. Here’s a comprehensive guide on Bitcoin Hyper if you want to learn more about it. To support the project, you can join the Bitcoin Hyper presale and buy tokens for $0.012675 each. You can also stake your tokens, if you prefer, and earn rewards at a rate of 120% p.a. Our Bitcoin Hyper buying guide has all the details you need to get your hands on $HYPER. Our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction estimates a $0.15-$0.32 price range for the end of 2025, which would mean a 1,090%-2,430% potential growth if you invest now. Buy Bitcoin Hyper tokens today to join an upcoming revolution in Bitcoin programmability and scalability. As demand for cryptocurrencies grows, it becomes more difficult to find high-quality ones. This is the case when you’re looking for the best meme coins. It’s like playing Russian roulette sometimes, as some could be scams that could cost you your hard-earned money. This is where Snorter Token ($SNORT) comes in. With just a few clicks, you’ll be able to snipe, trade tokens, manage your portfolio, and more. The bot also comes with a honeypot and rugpull detection feature that will help keep scammers and hackers at bay. Holding its native $SNORT token opens up even more perks when Snorter Bot launches, such as low transaction fees and governance rights. Of course, you’ll also be able to use it to pay for gas fees. $SNORT is currently available for only $0.1011 via the Snorter Token presale page. The staking rewards are very generous too at 143% p.a. Alternatively, you can consider HODLing as the token could reach as much as $3.25 by 2030 based on our Snorter Token price prediction. Whether you want to HODL, trade, or stake $SNORT, now’s your chance to take part in one of this year’s best presales. Join the Snorter Token presale today. Like $DOGE that it’s trying to parody, Shiba Inu ($SHIB) started out as a joke back in 2021. But now it’s so much more than that. It’s a payment method not just in crypto payment platforms but also in retailers, restaurants, and digital wallets. The coin had its peak back in late 2021, reaching a price of around $0.000088, based on TradingView data. While it’s mostly hovered around $0.000012-$0.000015 this year, $SHIB has been quite hot lately as it grew by a considerable 12.53% in the last seven days. While some traders might argue that the coin’s glory days are behind it, there are still many who remain bullish about $SHIB. With a market capitalization of over $8B and over 1.5M wallets holding it, it’s not the type of meme coin that will go away soon. Unlike the two previous ERC-20 coins we covered, $SHIB is widely available in major exchanges. Its low price, high liquidity, and wide availability can help you practice your trading without burning a hole in your wallet. As Ethereum broke past $4,500, it’s safe to say that its rally isn’t over yet. Like Bitcoin’s surge in July, we expect institutional investors to push $ETH’s price to greater heights, with a potential to return to its $4,800 ATH set in 2021. ERC-20 tokens like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) and Snorter Token ($SNORT) will be in other investors’ sights too if the trend continues. That’s because these investors will be looking at other promising coins to put their money in, in the hopes of growing their gains further. Disclaimer: Do your own research before you invest.

Title: Ethereum outshines Bitcoin as ETH ETFs see record $1B inflows!

Ethereum just pulled off a move that left Bitcoin in the dust and it’s not just about price. Ethereum ETFs shattered records on the 11th of August, with $1.019 billion in daily inflows led by BlackRock’s ETHA, which has doubled to $10 billion in three months, fueling ETH’s rally past $4,279. Ethereum [ETH] has notched a significant milestone on Wall Street, as U.S. spot ETH ETFs raked in a record-breaking $1.019 billion in net inflows on 11th August, leaving their Bitcoin [BTC]-focused counterparts far behind. At the forefront of this surge is BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), which has crossed the $10 billion net inflow mark. This achievement comes just three months after the fund doubled its previous $5 billion total, now holding over 3.3 million ETH in its portfolio. On the 11th of August, BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) saw its biggest single-day inflow since launch, adding 149,168 ETH worth approximately $640.68 million. The surge in investor activity pushed ETHA’s daily trading volume to an impressive $1.8 billion. The fund’s share price also set a new record, reaching $33.02 after a 5% jump on the 11th of August. In the last month alone, ETHA’s value has surged by 41%, and from its April low of $11.50, the ETF has skyrocketed by almost 200%. Analysts attribute the momentum to consistent ETH accumulation during June and July. While the broader digital asset market showed mixed performance with Bitcoin slipping below the $120,000 mark, Ethereum’s bullish trajectory remained intact. Over the past week, ETH has surged by 19%, far outpacing Bitcoin’s modest 4% gain. This strong performance has sparked speculation that Ethereum may be poised to reach a new all-time high. At the time of writing, ETH was trading at $4,279.18, up 2.18% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. In comparison, Bitcoin was down 1.18% over the same period, trading at $118,293.89. Adding to the buzz, Vitalik Buterin outlined his long-term vision for Ethereum’s future this week. He emphasized ultra-light nodes, built-in privacy, seamless self-custody, and a fully verified tech stack. This includes everything from decentralized apps to the hardware they run on. Buterin believes this evolution will normalize trustless security across society. He compared outdated “trust me” systems to drinking unfiltered tap water. Meanwhile, market watchers noted an unexpected move from BlackRock. On the 5th of August, Arkham Intelligence reported a major blockchain transaction by the asset manager. BlackRock transferred 2,544 BTC and 101,975 ETH to Coinbase Prime from ETF-linked holdings. This sparked speculation about whether it was routine or a strategic repositioning and the move added intrigue to an already eventful week for Ethereum.

Δ The venture, Merge Labs, seeks to raise $250 million at an $850 million valuation, and much of the funding is expected to come from OpenAI’s venture team, the Financial Times (FT) reported Tuesday (Aug. 12), citing unnamed sources. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has encouraged the investment and will co-found the venture, though he will not personally invest and will not be involved in its day-to-day operations, according to the report. OpenAI did not immediately reply to PYMNTS’ request for comment. The FT report said the new venture would compete with Elon Musk’s Neuralink, which was founded in 2016 and raised $650 million at a $9 billion valuation earlier this year. When Musk launched Neuralink, it was reported that he wanted to develop a “neural lace” that would be surgically connected to a human brain and give a person the ability to connect with a computer without having to use a keyboard, mouse or trackpad. One application explored by Neuralink includes how brain interfaces can relieve symptoms of chronic and dangerous medical conditions like epilepsy, severe depressive disorder and Parkinson’s. Neuralink announced in June that it raised $650 million in a Series E funding round and said it had made significant progress toward building brain interfaces “to help restore independence and expand what’s possible for humanity.” “Five individuals with severe paralysis are now using Neuralink to control digital and physical devices with their thoughts, marking a profound step toward helping restore independence,” the company said in a June 2 press release. In April 2024, Tether, the company behind the stablecoin USDT, announced a $200 million investment that granted it a majority stake in brain-computer-interface technology firm Blackrock Neurotech. Tether said at the time that Blackrock Neurotech is developing technologies that enable direct communication between the human brain and external devices and that the technology’s potential applications include helping people use only their thoughts to operate robotic arms, maneuver wheelchairs, surf the web or drive a car. Paolo Ardoino, CEO at Tether, said “the Brain-Computer-Interfaces of Blackrock Neurotech have the potential to open new realms of communication, rehabilitation and cognitive enhancement.” OpenAI Considering Investment in Venture to Connect Brains and Computers SEC Commissioner Says Regulator ‘Willing to Work With’ Tokenized Real-World Assets Paysafe Reports Surging eCommerce and Digital Wallet Volumes Does Gen AI in Accounting Live up to the Hype?

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Join the leading maritime news network A view of the Balboa Port is pictured after Hong Kong's CK Hutchison agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a BlackRock Inc-backed consortium, amid pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to curb China's influence in the region, Panama City, Panama, March 4, 2025. REUTERS/Enea Lebrun By Michael McDonald (Bloomberg) — The Panama Canal is planning to enter the ports business with a tender for two terminals, a move that comes amid a high-profile clash between the US and China over the waterway. The Panama Canal Authority expects to open a tender to operate a port on the Atlantic coast and another on the Pacific, both of which would connect to a liquefied petroleum gas pipeline. They would be owned by the canal and likely operated by a third party, Ricaurte Vasquez, head of the authority, said during an interview Monday in New York. “We are coming into the game of port terminals,” Vasquez said. Panama’s ports have drawn intense scrutiny from Washington in recent months. US President Donald Trump has criticized Chinese influence over the canal, threatening to take back the waterway and falsely alleging that Beijing controls it. Panama President Jose Raul Mulino has repeatedly defended the canal as a Panamanian operation over which the country exercises full sovereignty. Though China has no role in operating the canal, Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. has operated ports on the Atlantic and Pacific sides. The canal authority’s plan to own ports is part of $8.5 billion in capital spending it’s proposing over the next seven years, including the LPG pipeline, a new water reservoir and roads and highways. Existing ports run by CK Hutchison subsidiary Panama Ports Co., located outside the canal’s jurisdiction, were concessioned in 1997 and use old technology. The Panama canal will seek to use newer crane technology that moves cargo more efficiently, and compete with the more modern Port of Cartagena in nearby Colombia, Vasquez said. “We believe we can leapfrog that situation and we can try to do it differently,” Vasquez said. The decision comes as Mulino said his administration will draft a national maritime logistics strategy to determine a new framework for port operations in Panama. The country’s comptroller has filed suit against a contract extension with CK Hutchison’s local unit, potentially complicating the conglomerate’s plan to sell its global terminals business to a consortium involving BlackRock Inc. The Panama Canal is seeing an unexpected windfall this year due to new US tariffs. Shippers of semi-manufactured goods and automobiles rushed to import products to the US before duties took full effect, helping boost canal revenues. The canal authority expects the front-loading of cargo to dissipate in the next fiscal year beginning in October, and forecasts revenue of around $4.4 billion next year, below roughly $5 billion this year, Vasquez said. More plentiful rainfall this year has allowed the canal authority to maintain a draft of 50 feet (15 meters), which will likely continue through the end of the year, he said. A severe drought in the previous two years forced the canal to limit transits and use new water-saving techniques. © 2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: Dead seals washing up on Irish coasts more than double in three years

THE NUMBER OF dead seals washing up along Irish coasts more than doubled between 2020 and 2023, The Journal Investigates can reveal. The highest amount on record – 430 dead seals were reported to the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) in 2023, figures obtained under Access to Information on the Environment (AIE) reveal. That’s a jump from 201 reports in 2020, with the significant spike causing concern among experts that more frequent, severe weather – as well as human disturbance – is impacting the protected species in Ireland. While there was a dip in seal deaths recorded for 2024 (322), the numbers have been climbing significantly from 2018, according to the figures compiled by Seal Rescue Ireland (SRI). The centre, which monitors and gathers data on deaths, say they’ve also seen a rise in emergency pup rescues during recent, extreme storms, which has caused “chaos” for the marine mammals. “If you have repeated big storm events year after year during pupping seasons, it’s going to really start to affect populations at some point,” SRI general manager Kim Townsend-Smyth told The Journal Investigates. “There’s going to be a point where, if you continue to lose the majority of your pups, that’s going to start to have an impact.” The Journal / YouTube An investigation by The Journal Investigates has found multiple factors threatening the protected species here in Ireland. Currently, climate change and human disturbance present two of the biggest risks to colonies along our coasts. Documents obtained by our team under AIE request also show that a small number of seals have been illegally targeted and killed over the last five years. Separately, the NPWS has issued a number of licences to allow for the legal killing of “problem” seals. Between 2023 and 2025, three of these permits – one per year – were granted in unknown locations, with a NPWS spokesperson only confirming these related to controlling damage to salmon stocks. Granting of the licences followed heated disputes between government officials and fishermen over seals interfering with fish stocks. We previously revealed how 11 special licences to shoot seals were issued by the NPWS to salmon farms between 2015 and 2020. Internal NPWS notes reveal how in 2020, one group of fishermen demanded a cull, calling seal numbers “out of control”, resulting in substantial financial losses due to damaged catch. However, the government department said a cull would be a “significant policy shift” which would not gain the backing of the Minister for Heritage, or the public. One NPWS ranger told the meeting the targeting of seals would “set the Twitter machine on fire”. A NPWS spokesperson told The Journal Investigates: “While seals are a protected species, the Department may issue licenses to cull individual problem seals, and affected persons can apply for such licences.” Advertisement Investigations like this don’t happen without your support… Impactful investigative reporting is powered by people like you. Support The Journal Investigates The Journal Investigates can also reveal that between 2020 and 2025, the NPWS received some reports of deceased seals with alleged “gunshot” or “blade” wounds. Emails and images, as well as WhatsApp messages, obtained under AIE request reveal the concerns were raised by both members of the public, and NPWS officials. In one incident recorded in 2020, a dead seal was found tied to a mooring buoy in west Galway. A few days later, the NPWS launched an investigation into the “strong suspicion” that a seal was shot dead close to Blackrock Castle in Cork. However, post-mortem investigations couldn’t be carried out on the carcass as a university lab was closed, and on-site veterinary inspection was not possible. As a result, no further evidence could be gathered on the cause of death. However, one official said they were “90%” sure the animal had been shot. In another disturbing report, received by NPWS in 2021, a local resident discovered the fresh body of a seal pup in the Clonpriest area of East Cork. Images show the young seal with extensive trauma to its head, with the resident stating it appeared the animal’s head flesh was “cut off with a blade of some type”. They added: “There is No Doubt in my mind that Some Person or Persons in the East Cork area are and have been for some years past Killing Seals in the Area of Knockadoon and Ballycotton to Inch bay area of east [sic]”. The incident was reported to the area’s District Conservation Officer. The next month, a further three seals were found dead in the same area and reported by another individual. An email, which included images, stated: “We have been living here since 2005 and are used to occasionally coming across a dead seal, to find three on one morning was disturbing. They added: “The dead seals were not there on Tuesday morning when my wife walked the same route.” A series of internal WhatsApp messages also note the concern over the illegal targeting of seals along the Galway coast last year. One NPWS officer noted the discovery of a seal with a “likely firearm injury”. Three old and badly decomposed seal remains were also discovered, however their cause of death couldn’t be determined. In one message, the NPWS officer, who visited the site and took pictures, described the difficulty of “tying an illegally killed seal to an individual”. He added: “Hopefully a pattern doesn’t develop here.” An image of a dead seal pictured on the Galway coast in August 2024 with what NPWS describe as a likely gunshot wound According to the internal documents, the number of seal deaths reported along coasts increased sharply from 2020 onward, coinciding with SRI’s launch of an online reporting system for the public. The Co Wexford-based centre is the country’s only organisation dedicated to the rescue, rehabilitation, and release of sick, injured, and orphaned seals. The small team handles around 172 rescues per year – a figure that fluctuates sharply in response to the nation’s wild weather and rising public awareness.

Sign up You are now signed up According to data collected by the centre in 2023, Wexford had the highest number of dead seals that year, with 103 reports, followed by Donegal (69). Dublin recorded 41 deaths followed by Cork (44) and Kerry. No location data was available in the 2024 report. The latest data showed the autumn and winter months to be the deadliest for seals with 67 reports made in October, 41 in November and 42 in January. Ireland is home to two species of seal – the grey, as well as the harbour seal. The local population is estimated at between 7,000 and 10,000, according to the NPWS. Although the improved mechanism for tracking and awareness may partly explain the spike, Townsend-Smyth said the lack of necropsies – full veterinary post-mortems – carried out on seals makes it hard to see the full picture. “When we’re receiving dead seal reports, unfortunately, we can’t determine anything from a photograph,” the general manager told The Journal Investigates. “A lot of the pictures of seals that we get reported to us are in an advanced state of decomposition as well. So we can’t really [determine] anything without a proper veterinary examination. The lack of systematic necropsies is, in her view, a missed opportunity not only to detect intentional harm but also to study wider environmental threats. She said: “If there was a project in Ireland where necropsies could happen on dead seals, I think that would yield a lot of really interesting information. “Not just about potential intentional harm, but, infections out there or disease spread, or if there’s something happening pollution wise. “I think there’s so much valuable information about the marine ecosystem that could be discovered from doing necropsies.” A dead seal pictured on the Blasket Islands, Co Kerry. NPWS NPWS Asked about the lack of necropsies carried out on dead seals, a NPWS spokesperson told The Journal Investigates that it regularly assesses the seal population and is “satisfied” with numbers. The spokesperson added that “there is no evidence that the seal population has been adversely affected”. One thing SRI is sure of, is the impact of increasing Atlantic storms on Ireland’s seal population. “Two years ago, we had Storm Agnes and Storm Babet back to back,” said Townsend-Smyth. “It was chaos. “All the little white coat pups were washed off beaches and washed up somewhere else. So they were completely separated from their mums.” Repeated storm events, SRI said, is a “big concern” with “a lot of unknowns”. “So there’s a lot of potential there, I think, for not a very favourable future,” said Townsend-Smyth. “You have to take each year as it goes, look at the data that you have and collaborate with other centres to try to understand trends, and see what could be coming down the line.” Reporter: Patricia Devlin • Editor: Maria Delaney • Video Editor: Nicky Ryan • Social Media: Cliodhna Travers • Main Image Design: Lorcan O’Reilly Investigations like this don’t happen without your support...

He previously served four terms in the Texas House of Representatives. A decisive pushback against one of the most dangerous threats to American energy is underway. This comes as state attorneys general across the nation continue to scrutinize activist environmental groups that cripple U.S. energy, undermine markets, and threaten our national security. Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier announced that his office is officially probing the “climate cartel,” CDP (formerly the Climate Disclosure Project) and the Science Based Targets initiative, for possible violations of the state’s consumer-protection and antitrust laws. Subpoenas have been issued to both entities to assess whether they’re coercing American companies into paying for environmental disclosures and net-zero pledges under a veneer of transparency, while consolidating market power and extracting profit from those pledges. According to the press release, Uthmeier’s investigation focuses on CDP’s model of charging companies to disclose and revise climate data, and the Science Based Targets initiative’s role validating these pledges and funneling that information back into CDP’s scoring system. The investigation will examine deceptive trade practices, whether coordination between CDP, the Science Based Targets initiative, and the financial sector amounts to market manipulation, and whether companies that decline participation are punished, an anticompetitive scheme that Florida refuses to accept. “Radical climate activists have hijacked corporate governance and weaponized it against the free market,” Uthmeier stated. “Florida will not sit back while international pressure groups shake down American companies to fund their [environmental, social, and governance] grift.” This move complements recent actions in Kansas, where Attorney General Kris Kobach urged the U.S. Department of Justice to open a federal probe into the China-backed Energy Foundation China over its suspected role in financing radical climate lawsuits targeting fossil fuel producers. The global energy race is playing out right now, and China is surging ahead. While U.S. firms battle climate litigation, foreign ESG pressure, and activist mandates, China is adding massive grid capacity, largely dependent on coal, and locking in long-term energy dominance, all while quietly funding the rules that hamper its competitors. Against this backdrop, the unraveling of ESG’s favorite instrument, the Science Based Targets initiative, is striking. Shell, Aker BP, and Enbridge recently walked away from the Science Based Targets initiative, refusing to halt development of “new oil and gas fields” by the end of 2027. These investigations must be backed up with broader reform: Federal and state policies should prohibit taxpayer dollars or government contracts from going to entities that participate in foreign-funded ESG or environmental scoring systems. Companies forced to conform to these climate cartels should be disqualified from subsidies, procurement, or pension-related investing. This legal pressure is now being matched by financial oversight. In a powerful show of unity, 21 state financial officers issued a warning to the heads of JPMorgan, BlackRock, and other financial institutions to stop using ESG metrics that discriminate against American energy producers. The letters follow a report Will Hild of Consumers’ Research and I released exposing how BlackRock continues to take action against fossil fuel companies despite claiming otherwise. Together with the attorneys general investigations, this marks a turning point in the effort to roll back the climate cartel’s influence over American business. American energy and commerce must not bow to foreign influence masquerading as ethical capital. It’s long past time to call out these global pressure networks and demand accountability. Whether via deceptive trade practices, antitrust violations, or covert influence, if laws are being broken, the perpetrators should face consequences. This wave of state leadership is more than ideological; it’s strategic. U.S. energy independence hinges on a legal environment that rewards performance, not posturing. Financial transparency should protect investors, not exploit producers. Corporate governance should empower boards to innovate, not impose tedious pledges that undermine realities. Florida’s attorney general is using “every tool of the law to stop the Climate Cartel from exploiting businesses and misleading consumers,” a bold statement of state sovereignty and consumer protection. Kansas is exposing foreign-funded litigation vendettas. If we sustain that momentum, we can reclaim our economic agency and restore objective, accountable energy policy. These actions by Uthmeier and Kobach, and the demands from state financial officers, are necessary steps in an ongoing battle. These are investigative, not symbolic. Now comes the enforcement: subpoenas, court summonses, legislative reforms. The goal must be to dismantle the cartel’s influence and reassert free enterprise. We face a global energy power play. If U.S. climate law becomes a tool of foreign influence, America loses. If ESG schemes become mandatory for access to capital, innovation stagnates, grid reliability weakens, and consumers lose. Florida and Kansas are showing how to use law, not slogans, to expose the modern climate cartel. Let’s follow their lead, demand accountability, and defend American energy dominance. American energy dominance isn’t just an ideal—it’s a necessity. And it’s time we protected it accordingly. We publish a variety of perspectives.

Title: ‘Take some time to look up’: Perseid meteor shower could be visible from Ireland tonight

One of the most eagerly awaited astronomical events of the year – which promised one or two meteors or “shooting stars” a minute – is set to continue in Irish skies on Wednesday night. Tuesday night saw about 60 meteors an hour darting across the sky and stargazers can expect about half that amount on Wednesday night. “The Perseids will be half as strong tonight as they were last night, so that’s still 10 times more meteors tonight than a normal night, so well worth viewing,” said David Moore from astronomy.ie. “The best time to view is dusk until dawn,” he said. “We had people sending us counts of how many they saw every 15 minutes from 10:30pm last night when it got dark enough to see them. I saw some after 4am when dawn was breaking.” “Dublin gets much the same view as the rest of the country, indeed, all of Europe,” Mr Moore said. “This year the moon is in the sky so even those in the countryside will have moonlit skies so even suburban viewers will get the same view.” Met Éireann has forecast a humid night with clear spells on Wednesday, however a few showers are possible which could be heavy or thundery. Mr Moore advised stargazers to ensure they are comfortable while looking up. “Standing with your neck craned back for hours is not comfortable. “Look anywhere in the sky. If there are clouds look in the clear patches. If totally clear stand with your back to the moon so it does not dazzle you,” he said. “The paths of the meteors will all point back to the constellation Perseus but you do not have to look at Perseus.” The Perseid meteors are caused by dust particles shed by the comet Swift-Tuttle. The comet, which takes 133 years to orbit the sun, was last seen in Irish skies in 1992. At this time of year, Earth moves through this debris cloud, making one of the most celebrated astronomical events and arguably the most predictable. Particles from the debris cloud subsequently burn up on entering Earth’s atmosphere and create flashes of light. The shower is active for several weeks. “It’s such a special time of the year,” said astronomer Danielle Wilcox from Blackrock Castle Observatory, Cork. “It’s a really good meteor shower in particular because it gives us a lot of meteors per hour compared to other meteor showers,” she said. “That’s what’s so exciting about it, especially for people who have never seen ‘shooting stars’, this is your chance to get out there and see that,” she said. “Take some time to look up,” she said.

Title: XRP Double-Bottom Breakout Sets Sights On $34, Predicts Analyst

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Gert van Lagen says the macro structure of XRP has finally done the one thing it needed to do: break the neckline of a seven-year base and hold it. “XRP [2W] – Ripple is ready to rip. The 7-year double bottom has broken out at ❌ The neckline was successfully retested at 🔵 ATH cleared — first target near ~$34, at 2.00 fib. extension of double bottom. → Compare with 2014–2017 setup,” the analyst wrote. His chart is drawn on a logarithmic scale with two-week candles, framing the move as a multi-cycle reversal rather than a short-term pop. The geometry is clear on the chart. A broad W-shaped base stretching from the 2018–2024 bear market carved twin lows in the sub-$0.20–$0.30 region, then returned to a horizontal neckline that sits just above the $2 handle. Van Lagen marks an initial breakout attempt with a red cross just over that barrier, followed by a decisive surge and a pullback that tags support around the $2 area, annotated with a blue dot. On a log chart, that textbook breakout-retest sequence is the confirmation step technicians typically look for before projecting targets. Price at the time of the snapshot is labeled $3.19 on the right axis, meaning XRP is trading above the neckline but still below the 2018 all-time high at $3.40. That placement matters because the prior macro cap now acts as support; staying north of roughly $2.00 keeps the double-bottom thesis intact. The measured arrow drawn from the neckline replicates the height of the base on a multiplicative (log) basis, which is why the upside extension leaps into the mid-double digits rather than adding only a few dollars. Van Lagen’s first objective is derived explicitly from Fibonacci proportions. He sets the 2.00 extension of the double-bottom as the initial target, landing “near ~$34.” On his scale the projected path peaks above the $27 and $20 grid lines and briefly tags the mid-$30s before mean-reverting, consistent with how log-scale extensions translate when a long consolidation unwinds quickly. The left side of the graphic provides the historical rhyme he wants readers to notice. Between 2014 and 2017, XRP built a smaller double-bottom within a shaded accumulation zone, broke its neckline, retested it, and then accelerated vertically. Van Lagen marks that sequence with the same red cross at breakout and blue dot at the retest, plus a vertical measuring arrow to illustrate how the earlier base resolved. The current pattern, shaded across 2018–2025, repeats that choreography at a far larger scale. His sketch includes a time-and-price roadmap using twelve forward candles—two-week bars—implying a five- to six-month arc for the entire move if it were to echo the prior cycle. The first projected bar vaults XRP above $11. After three candles, the blue path tops out above $36, roughly six weeks into the run. The fourth candle traces a deep retracement back toward the $11 region, followed by a sharp recovery above $30 on the fifth. The next three candles stabilize around the $30 area before the path draws another slide to ~$11 and the onset of a cooling phase. The sequence is illustrative rather than prescriptive, but it visually anchors the extension math to possible market behavior. Whether XRP can follow the steep path sketched in blue is a separate question from whether the double-bottom has technically activated. Van Lagen’s chart answers the second with a yes: the breakout and retest sequence is complete. The first answer—delivery toward the ~$34 Fib extension—will be determined by how the next several two-week candles will look like. At press time, XRP traded at $3.14.

Title: Bullish Cryptocurrency Exchange Expands IPO Plans To $5 Billion

Peter Thiel-backed cryptocurrency exchange Bullish has announced a significant increase in the size of its initial public offering (IPO), aiming to raise approximately $990 million. According to a recent filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the company plans to offer 30 million shares priced between $32 and $33 each, targeting a market valuation of around $4.8 billion. This marks a notable shift from its earlier proposal, which included the sale of 20.3 million shares at a lower price range of $28 to $31, with a valuation goal of $4.2 billion. Led by former New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) president Tom Farley, Bullish has granted its underwriters—comprising JPMorgan, Jefferies, and Citigroup—a 30-day option to sell an additional 4.5 million shares. Once the new offering is completed, the crypto exchange’s stock will be traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “BLSH.” In a show of confidence, major investment firms such as the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, and Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management, have expressed interest in acquiring up to $200 million worth of BLSH shares. This interest reflects a broader trend of renewed investor enthusiasm and regulatory support for the cryptocurrency sector under President Donald Trump’s new administration, as evidenced by recent successful market entries, including the notable debut of stablecoin issuer Circle (CRLC). The Bullish crypto exchange founded in the “year of the bull,” 2021, has also outlined plans to convert a significant portion of the initial public offering proceeds into stablecoins, collaborating with one or more dollar-pegged cryptocurrency issuers to facilitate this transition. This decision follows the recent signing of the GENIUS Act into law by President Donald Trump. The country’s first crypto bill establishes a new framework for stablecoins to thrive and integrate into the traditional finance sector. Despite its ambitious plans and the positive market climate, Bullish reported a loss of $349 million for the quarter ending March 31, a stark contrast to the $105 million profit it recorded during the same period last year. As Bullish prepares for its IPO, it joins a wave of crypto firms entering public markets, including Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital, which recently uplisted to Nasdaq, and eToro, which has opened trading to the public. Additionally, crypto custody startup BitGo and the Winklevoss-run Gemini crypto exchange have both confidentially filed for US listings, signaling a renewed interest in cryptocurrency investments under a more favorable regulatory environment in the US. Amid these developments, the total cryptocurrency market capitalization hit a new record high of $4 trillion on Monday, with Bitcoin (BTC) once again surpassing the $120,000 threshold. However, despite Monday’s early momentum, the total market cap has since retraced and stabilized at around $3.93 trillion.

U.S.-listed ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) surpassed $1 billion in daily inflows for the first time on Monday as the second-largest cryptocurrency hit its highest price for over three and a half years. The nine ETFs comfortably surpassed the previous daily high of $726.74 million from July 17, according to data tracked by SoSoValue. BlackRock's (BLK) ETHA led the way, registering inflows of just under $640 million, while Fidelity's FETH was a rather distant second with $276.9 million. Cumulative inflows into the funds now sit at $10.83 billion with total assets valued at $25.71 billion, equivalent to 4.77% of ether's market cap. ETH rose as high as $4,358 on Monday, its highest level since December 2021, according to CoinDesk data. Ether's gains followed data that cemented expectations the Federal Reserve would lower interest rates, making riskier assets more attractive. The probability of a 25 basis point cut in September is some 84%, according the CME's FedWatch tool. In addition, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) finally dropped its lawsuit against XRP developer Ripple, providing a further boost to the broader altcoin market.

Title: Tonight, tomorrow best times to see Perseid meteor shower
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/ireland/2025/0812/1528037-perseid-meteor-shower/

The Perseid meteor shower will reach its peak tonight and tomorrow, making it the best time for stargazers to view the celestial fireworks. The event is associated with the dusty debris left by Comet Swift-Tuttle, which orbits the sun once every 133 years. The meteoroids from the comet, mostly no bigger than a grain of sand, burn up as they hit the Earth's atmosphere at 36 miles per second, to produce a shooting stream of light in the sky. Peak temperatures can reach anywhere from 1,648C to 5,537C as they hit the atmosphere. The meteors are called Perseids because they seem to dart out of the constellation Perseus. Speaking on RTÉ's Morning Ireland, Resident Astronomer at Blackrock Observatory in Cork Danielle Wilcox said the best time to view the spectacle is after sunset and before the moon rise as it will be the darkest time. Ms Wilcox said there are around 12 meteor showers every year but Perseid has the most and brightest meteors. "These are very predictable, they happen every year at the same time," she said. "What is happening is we have comets that come from the outer solar system and they come in from the sun and they come near the sun and start to break up. "So you have all this debris that comes from the comet, so you will have ice, rock and different things that are coming from the comet. "And it leaves this cloud and it is in the same spot in space, so as we are going around the sun, Earth slams into this cloud and passes through all this debris in August every year," Ms Wilcox said. She said if anyone misses meteor shower tonight or tomorrow, not to worry as it continues for the next week. © RTÉ 2025.

Share this article US-listed spot Ethereum ETFs listed in the US pulled in more than $1 billion in net inflows on Monday, their highest daily total since debut, according to data tracked by Farside Investors. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) and Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH) also posted their largest single-day inflows, drawing about $640 million and $277 million, respectively. Except for Invesco’s fund, all other Ether ETFs posted positive results. BlackRock has maintained its top position, with assets under management exceeding $13 billion as of August 11. Monday’s gains pushed Ethereum funds into a five-day winning streak. Their longest winning streak on record took place between July 3 and July 31. The strong performance came as ETH hovered around $4,300, its highest level since December 2021. The digital asset is now around 12% away from its all-time high of $4,868 set in November 2021 during the bull run market, TradingView data shows. Ethereum’s price surge comes amid aggressive accumulations from publicly traded companies, such as Tom Lee’s BitMine and SharpLink Gaming. Furthermore, on Monday, Fundamental Global, soon to be renamed FG Nexus, which recently filed a $5 billion shelf registration with the SEC to expand its Ethereum accumulation strategy, announced it had acquired 47,331 ETH as part of its ambition to take a 10% stake in the network.

By The Associated Press A cargo ship navigates through the Panama Canal, seen from the Cerro Ancon in Panama City. Matias Delacroix/AP hide caption UNITED NATIONS — The United States and China clashed over the Panama Canal at the United Nations on Monday, with the U.S. warning that Beijing's influence over the key waterway could threaten global trade and security and China calling U.S. accusations a pretext to take over the canal. The clash took place at a U.N. Security Council meeting where Panama's President José Raúl Mulino stressed the neutrality of the canal and his country's ownership of the waterway linking the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Panama holds the council presidency this month, and Mulino was chairing a meeting on challenges to maritime security. Interpol Secretary General Valdecy Urquiza told members these include piracy, armed robbery, transnational crime and cyber criminals weaponizing artificial intelligence to attack ports where there is "minimal cyber security, maximum exposure." U.S. President Donald Trump thrust Panama into the spotlight even before winning election last November by suggesting that his country should consider retaking control of the Panama Canal and accusing Panama of ceding influence to China. The U.S. built the canal in the early 1900s as it looked for ways to facilitate the transit of commercial and military vessels between its coasts. Control of the waterway transferred to Panama in 1999 under a treaty signed in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter. China's U.N. Ambassador Fu Cong emphasized to the council that "Panama has consistently and effectively managed the canal, making significant contributions to global shipping and trade." "China has always respected the permanent neutrality of the canal and firmly supports Panama in safeguarding its sovereignty over the canal to ensure its openness and smooth operation," he said. Acting U.S. Ambassador Dorothy Shea, who spoke afterward, went after China, expressing concern about its "outsized influence over the Panama Canal area, especially over critical infrastructure and port operations." Alluding to its claims in the South China Sea, she said, "China's expansive and unlawful maritime claims and aggressive actions demonstrate its threat to maritime security and commerce." She said the U.S. rejects these claims and supports countries opposing them. "China's influence in the canal area is not just a risk to Panama and the United States, but rather a potential threat to global trade and security," Shea said. The Trump administration has pressured China to have the Hong Kong-based operator of ports at either end of the canal sell those interests to a U.S. consortium that includes BlackRock Inc. Panama has vehemently rejected a takeover of the canal, but in April, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth visited Panama and agreed with Mulino to step up security coordination. The agreement also gives U.S. troops access to strategic air and naval facilities in the Central American nation, which sparked large protests in Panama's capital. China's Fu asked for the floor to respond to Shea's accusations after all council members spoke, this time lashing out at the Trump administration. "The United States' fabrication of lies and groundless attacks against China are nothing but a pretext for seeking control of the canal," he said. The Chinese envoy called the U.S. and its deployment of offensive weapons in the South China Sea area "the biggest disrupter of peace and stability" in the region, and he accused the administration of exacerbating risks to global maritime security. "China firmly opposes economic coercion and bullying practices and urges the United States to stop fabricating rumors, lies and creating trouble," Fu said. Murillo then responded, saying he wanted to stress Panama's sovereignty "in terms of the ownership of the canal" and the multilateral treaty governing its administration. He called the canal's neutrality "the only and the best defense" to any specific or global threats. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor

Title: All-Time High For Crypto Market: Ethereum Leads The Charge Above $4,000

On Monday, the total crypto market capitalization (TOTAL) reached an all-time high (ATH) of $4.03 trillion, driven by significant gains in leading cryptocurrencies Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), reflecting renewed optimism in the crypto space fueled by favorable regulatory developments from the US. Ethereum notably broke through the $4,000 barrier for the first time in almost nine months, closing the gap to its all-time high of $4,878, now just 13% away. This upward momentum has been attributed to growing interest in cryptocurrencies, bolstered by pro-crypto regulatory measures that have enhanced market sentiment. Notably, the US has spearheaded a new wave of pro-crypto regulations, sparking a surge in investment in the digital asset market with the passage and signing of the first crypto bill, the GENIUS Act. This new legislation aims to create a more favorable regulatory framework for stablecoins, which are dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies. Ethereum plays a key role in the stablecoin market, as a large portion of stablecoin activity occurs on its blockchain. In contrast, Bitcoin approached its current record high of $123,000 earlier in the day but ultimately fell short of the critical $120,000 mark, which is seen as essential for entering a new price discovery phase. Despite this, the overall market sentiment remains buoyant, particularly in light of recent executive orders from President Donald Trump aimed at fostering a more favorable environment for digital assets. On Thursday, Trump issued directives calling for a reevaluation of federal guidance on integrating cryptocurrencies into employer-sponsored retirement plans like 401(k)s. Analysts view this shift as a potential boom for the crypto industry, especially considering that 401(k) assets totaled $8.7 trillion in the first quarter of 2025, according to the Investment Company Institute. As such, Ethereum has outperformed many of its peers among the top ten cryptocurrencies, posting gains of just over 13% in the past week. The only token to surpass this growth has been Cronos (CRO), which saw an 18% rally during the same period. Crypto analyst Doctor Profit has weighed in on Ethereum’s performance, suggesting that breaking the $4,000 barrier signals a massive breakout from an ascending triangle pattern on the monthly chart. This pattern is considered bullish, indicating that Ethereum could continue its upward trajectory in the coming months. In a recent analysis shared on X (formerly Twitter), Doctor Profit projected that Ethereum might reach new heights, potentially hitting $8,000. If this forecast holds true, it would represent an impressive 88% increase from ETH’s current trading price of $4,250 as of late Monday.

Title: How safe is your sunscreen and how long does it last after opening?

Consumer concerns have been raised about the protection offered by sunscreens after some well known brands were found in independent studies to contain less SPF (sun protection factor) than they indicated on the label. The consumer groups Choice and Which? sent a variety of popular sunscreen brands to be tested in accredited independent laboratories to see if they met their stated SPF claims. The brands Ultra Violette and Ultrasun were found to offer much lower levels of SPF than their labels indicated. Choice found that Ultra Violette’s Lean Screen SPF50+ Mattifying Zinc Skinscreen, which retails for €39 at Space NK, returned a SPF rating of just 4 when tested. Separately, Which? revealed that the Ultrasun Family SPF30 lotion, which retails for €35 at Boots, did not meet the minimum required UVA level in their tests. Both Ultra Violette and Ultrasun strongly disputed the claims citing their own testing protocols as superior to those employed in Choice and Which?’s research. Lidl and Aldi’s own-brand products were Which?’s best value sunscreens. Aldi’s Lacura SPF50+ Sensitive Lotion and Lidl’s Cien Sun Spray SPF30, which both retail for €3.99, passed key sun safety tests and were significantly cheaper than their big brand rivals. However, Choice found that another Aldi own-brand sunscreen, Ombra Everyday Sunscreen Lotion 50+, which is not available in Ireland but is sold abroad, returned an SPF rating of just 26. We put Choice and Which?’s findings to three consultant dermatologists, each of whom say they would not be concerned by the results. “Sunscreen testing is technically complex and highly sensitive to variations in methodology,” says Prof Caitríona Ryan, consultant dermatologist at the Institute of Dermatologists and Blackrock Clinic. “In the case of the recent Choice report, several products were tested using a small sample size, which is well below the standard required for international SPF testing. Ultra Violette have since provided retesting data from accredited labs showing that their products do meet or exceed SPF 50+ claims under proper conditions.” Prof Anne-Marie Tobin, consultant dermatologist and professor of clinical medicine at Trinity College Dublin, is more concerned by lack of awareness around the exposure risks of applying expired sunscreen. “You should not use any old sun cream out of your bathroom cabinet, as it may have expired. Expired sun cream will not give you protection against UVA or UVB rays, as the active ingredient in the sun cream will have degraded,” Prof Tobin says. “You can check if your sun cream has expired by looking for a small drawing of a jar with a lid that has a number inside it, which is on every bottle of sun cream. The number tells you how many months you can use your sun cream for after you have opened it.” Prof Ryan adds that while UVB rays are primarily responsible for sunburn and direct DNA damage, UVA rays penetrate deeper into the skin, accelerating photo-ageing and increasing the long-term risk of skin cancer. “Unlike UVB, UVA levels remain constant throughout the year and can penetrate through cloud and glass. This is why choosing a sun cream that offers broad-spectrum protection, which shields against both UVA and UVB, is essential, even on cloudy days or when indoors near windows and particularly when driving,” Prof Ryan says. When it comes to the difference in protection between SPF30 and SPF50, Prof Ryan explains: “The SPF is a time-based measure, it indicates how much longer someone can stay in the sun without burning, compared to wearing no sunscreen. If you would normally burn after 10 minutes of sun exposure, an SPF30 theoretically allows you to stay protected for 300 minutes, while SPF50 would extend that to 500 minutes. SPF30 filters out around 97 per cent of UVB rays, and SPF50 filters about 98 per cent.” Prof Tobin and London-based consultant dermatologist Dr Aamna Adel agree that more people than ever are practising sun safety whether that is because people have aesthetic concerns around skin ageing or they are worried about developing skin cancer. Prof Tobin notes that while patients are very good at applying protection to their faces, they are not as good at protecting their chest, shoulders, neck and back. All three experts agreed that most skin cancers arise from cumulative UV exposure. “You can get skin cancer from being continuously exposed to low levels of UV over many years, rather than a one-off burn. It is best to turn putting on sun cream into an everyday habit like brushing your teeth. However, sun cream is only as effective as the person who applies it and most people don’t apply enough sun cream or don’t reapply their sun cream as frequently as they should,” Dr Adel says. [ Sunscreen: All you need to know to pick the best SPF for your face, scalp and bodyOpens in new window ] Prof Ryan also points to an alarming trend among younger people, using UV index data, not to avoid harm, but to maximise tanning. “Some social media influencers now promote the idea of ‘safe tanning’ during peak UV hours, but UV radiation is a Group 1 carcinogen, and tanning, even without burning, still causes cumulative DNA damage that can lead to skin cancer. There is also a common misconception that sunscreen blocks all vitamin D production, but research shows that people produce adequate vitamin D while wearing SPF.” Prof Ryan has seen an increase in the number of younger adults being diagnosed with melanomas. “Particularly women in their 20s and 30s, which is likely linked to intermittent high-intensity UV exposure from tanning beds and sun holidays.” Prof Tobin advises that most sun protection should be provided by clothing, and staying out of the sun when the UV is strongest between 12pm and 3pm. Skin cancer is the most common cancer in Ireland, with more than 11,000 people diagnosed annually according to the Irish Cancer Society. The National Skin Cancer Registry Ireland expects the number of diagnoses to double by 2040. However, Prof Tobin believes the official diagnosis statistics are actually underestimated because statisticians must verify every case and so are “likely quite behind with the figures they publish”. There are two main categories of skin cancer: melanoma and non-melanoma. Dr Adel says that the symptoms of melanoma are “a mole that is in any way changing in size, colour, texture or even if it begins to itch”. While the symptoms of non-melanoma are: “a spot or scab that is oozing, crusting over or just not healing”. Prof Tobin wants there to be greater awareness around the symptoms of non-melanoma skin cancer as it is the most common form of skin cancer. “About 1,200 people are diagnosed with melanoma skin cancers every year, the rest are all non-melanoma.” Dr Adel frequently encounters people who delay getting checked because they worry that they will be wasting the doctor’s time. “I would much rather have people come to see me with something that does not turn out to need treatment than to wait longer and potentially put themselves at risk. Early detection gives patients the best chance of making a full recovery,” Dr Adel says. [ Six of the best budget sunscreens for summer 2025Opens in new window ] In response to Choice’s SPF protection findings Ultra Violette issued this statement: “Ultra Violette is deeply committed to the health and safety of our customers and only work with reputable, TGA licensed manufacturers who perform substantial quality release testing in accordance with the strictest SPF standards in the world. We do not accept these results as even remotely accurate.” Likewise, Ultrasun disputed Which?’s findings: “Ultrasun is fully confident in our testing protocols. Our chosen testing protocol is one of the strictest available, and our UVB and UVA filters are tested both in vitro and in vivo. We conclusively support the result of our independent tests which found that the Ultrasun Family SPF30 reached a UVB-SPF in vivo of 31.4 and a UVA-PF in vitro of 13.1, which equates to a 92 per cent UVA absorbance.” © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: A US senator from Colombia emerges as a Trump link for Latin America's conservatives

U.S. Sen. Bernie Moreno has emerged as an interlocutor for conservatives in Latin America seeking to connect with the Trump administration MIAMI -- When Republican Sen. Bernie Moreno visits Colombia this week as part of a three-nation tour of Latin America, it will be something of a homecoming. Ohio’s first Latino senator, who defeated an incumbent last year with the help of Donald Trump’s endorsement, was born in the Colombian capital of Bogota, and even as he was chasing the American dream, he kept close tabs on the country through older brothers who are heavyweights in politics and business there. Moreno, 58, has emerged as an interlocutor for conservatives in Latin America seeking to connect with the Trump administration. In an interview with The Associated Press ahead of the trip, he expressed deep concern about Colombia’s direction under left-wing President Gustavo Petro and suggested that U.S. sanctions, higher tariffs or other retaliatory action might be needed to steer it straight. The recent criminal conviction of former President Alvaro Uribe, a conservative icon, was an attempt to “silence” the man who saved Colombia from guerrilla violence, Moreno said. Meanwhile, record cocaine production has left the United States less secure — and Colombia vulnerable to being decertified by the White House for failing to cooperate in the war on drugs. “The purpose of the trip is to understand all the dynamics before any decision is made,” said Moreno, who will meet with both Petro and Uribe, as well as business leaders and local officials. “But there’s nothing that’s taken off the table at this point and there’s nothing that’s directly being contemplated.” Moreno, a luxury car dealer from Cleveland, defeated incumbent Democrat Sherrod Brown last year with the help of $441 million in political ad spending — the most in U.S. Senate race history. He became Ohio’s senior senator on practically his first day in office after his close friend JD Vance resigned the Senate to become vice president. In Congress, Moreno has mimicked Trump’s rhetoric to attack top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer as a “miserable old man out of a Dickens novel,” called on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates and threatened to subpoena California officials over their response to anti-ICE protests in Los Angeles. On Latin America, he’s been similarly outspoken, slamming Petro on social media as a “socialist dictator” and accusing Mexico of being on the path to becoming a “narco state.” He also surprised many hardliners in the GOP early on by suggesting in January that Trump should engage with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro despite his re-election in what the U.S., European Union and other governments condemned as a rigged vote. While referring to Maduro as a “gang leader” and "terrorist," Moreno nonetheless expressed support for the Trump administration's decision last month to allow energy giant Chevron to resume drilling in Venezuela following a deal with Maduro to free 10 jailed Americans held there. “What people wanted to hear in January is that we’re going to fly F-16s into Caracas and wage war against the country and that just wasn’t going to happen,” said Moreno in the interview. “If we take actions that are too much in that direction, we end up turning Venezuela over to China.” Such comments barely register in blue-collar Ohio, but they’ve garnered attention in Latin America. That despite the fact Moreno hasn’t lived in the region for decades and doesn’t sit on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. “He’s somebody to watch,” said Michael Shifter, the former president of the Inter-American Dialogue in Washington. “He’s one of the most loyal Trump supporters in the Senate, and, given his background in Latin America, he could be influential on policy.” Moreno starts his first congressional delegation to Latin America on Monday for two days of meetings in Mexico City with officials including President Claudia Sheinbaum. Moreno, in the pre-trip interview, said that Sheinbaum has done more to combat the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. than her predecessor and mentor Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who he described as a “total disaster.” But he said more cooperation is needed, and he’d like to see Mexico allow the DEA to participate in judicial wiretaps like it has for decades in Colombia and allow it to bring back a plane used in bilateral investigations that López Obrador grounded. “The corruption becomes so pervasive, that if it’s left unchecked, it’s kind of like treating cancer,” said Moreno. “Mexico has to just come to the realization that it does not have the resources to completely wipe out the drug cartels. And it’s only going to be by asking the U.S. for help that we can actually accomplish that.” From Mexico, Moreno heads to Panama, where he’ll tour the Panama Canal with Trump’s new ambassador to the country, Kevin Marino Cabrera. In March, a Hong Kong-based conglomerate struck a deal that would have handed control of two ports on either end of the U.S.-built canal to American investment firm BlackRock Inc. The deal was heralded by Trump, who had threatened to take back the canal to curb Chinese influence. However, the deal has since drawn scrutiny from antitrust authorities in Beijing and last month the seller said it was seeking to add a strategic partner from mainland China — reportedly state-owned shipping company Cosco — to the deal. “Cosco, you might as well say, is the actual communist party,” said Moreno. “There’s no scenario in which Cosco can be part of the Panamanian ports.” On the final leg of the tour in Colombia, Moreno will be joined by another Colombian American senator: Ruben Gallego, Democrat of Arizona. In contrast to Moreno, who was born into privilege and counts among his siblings a former ambassador to the U.S., Gallego and his three sisters were raised by an immigrant single mother on a secretary’s paycheck. Despite their different upbringings, the two have made common cause in seeking to uphold the tradition of bilateral U.S. support for Colombia, for decades Washington’s staunchest ally in the region. It’s a task made harder by deepening polarization in both countries. The recent sentencing of Uribe to 12 years of house arrest in a long-running witness tampering case has jolted the nation’s politics with nine months to go before decisive presidential elections. The former president is barred from running but remains a powerful leader, and Moreno said his absence from the campaign trail could alter the playing field. He also worries that surging cocaine production could once again lead to a “narcotization” of a bilateral relationship that should be about trade, investment and mutual prosperity. “We want Colombia to be strong, we want Colombia to be healthy, we want Colombia to be prosperous and secure, and I think the people of Colombia want the exact same thing,” he added. “So, the question is, how do we get there?” ___ Smyth reported from Columbus, Ohio. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

The Trump administration has pressured China to have the Hong Kong-based operator of ports at either end of the canal sell those interests to a U.S. consortium that includes BlackRock Inc. Panama has vehemently rejected a takeover of the canal, but in April, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth visited Panama and agreed with Mulino to step up security coordination. The agreement also gives U.S. troops access to strategic air and naval facilities in the Central American nation, which sparked large protests in Panama’s capital. China’s Fu asked for the floor to respond to Shea’s accusations after all council members spoke, this time lashing out at the Trump administration. “The United States’ fabrication of lies and groundless attacks against China are nothing but a pretext for seeking control of the canal,” he said. The Chinese envoy called the U.S. and its deployment of offensive weapons in the South China Sea area “the biggest disrupter of peace and stability” in the region, and he accused the administration of exacerbating risks to global maritime security. “China firmly opposes economic coercion and bullying practices and urges the United States to stop fabricating rumors, lies and creating trouble,” Fu said. Murillo then responded, saying he wanted to stress Panama’s sovereignty “in terms of the ownership of the canal” and the multilateral treaty governing its administration. He called the canal’s neutrality “the only and the best defense” to any specific or global threats.

Title: TMTG moves closer to launching spot Bitcoin ETF with amended S-1 filing

The prospective Truth Social Bitcoin ETF moves closer to reality as Trump Media files amendments, intensifying focus on its ambitious crypto vision. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) has filed its first amended registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF, advancing plans to enter the fast-growing spot Bitcoin ETF market. The ETF, to be listed on NYSE Arca under the ticker B.T., will hold Bitcoin (BTC) directly and seek to track the flagship crypto’s market price. Crypto.com will act as the exclusive custodian, prime execution agent, and liquidity provider, while Yorkville America Digital will serve as the ETF’s sponsor. The ETF’s structure allocates 70% of its assets to Bitcoin, with 15% in U.S. Treasury securities and 15% in cash or cash equivalents, aiming to balance exposure to the crypto with traditional financial instruments. The launch remains subject to SEC approval of both the updated Form S-1 registration and a separate Form 19b-4 listing application. The company has not provided a specific launch date but indicated it expects the fund to go live before year-end. TMTG, parent of the Truth Social social platform, streaming service Truth+, and fintech brand Truth.Fi, said the ETF forms part of a broader Bitcoin-focused strategy. The strategy includes building a corporate Bitcoin treasury and expanding into digital asset products through its financial services division. The company has already committed substantial capital to Bitcoin acquisitions this year, positioning itself among the more aggressive corporate entrants into the sector. If approved, the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF would enter a competitive landscape dominated by heavyweight issuers such as BlackRock, whose spot Bitcoin ETF has drawn billions in inflows since the first U.S. approvals in January and set multiple records. The ETFs have attracted a mix of institutional and retail investors seeking regulated exposure to Bitcoin without the need for self-custody. The filing also highlights the political dimension of TMTG’s crypto ambitions. President Donald Trump, the company’s majority shareholder, has made digital assets a policy priority, pledging to roll back what he calls restrictive regulations and promote U.S. leadership in the crypto economy. A spot Bitcoin ETF tied to a political brand of Trump’s profile would be unprecedented in the market, potentially attracting a distinct investor base but also intensifying public and regulatory scrutiny. The timing of the filing reflects an environment where spot Bitcoin ETFs are gaining mainstream acceptance and competitive differentiation is becoming critical. While the SEC has approved multiple products this year, new entrants face the challenge of building liquidity and investor trust in a market already served by established issuers.

Title: REX Osprey Solana ETF posts zero net flows across majority of August sessions

The main reasons are likely lack of institutional interest and the complicated structure which the ETF is based on, analysts weigh in. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. REX Osprey Solana (SOL) exchange-traded fund (ETF) recorded zero trading activity on four of six trading days through August 8, according to Farside Investors data. Trading under ticker SSK, the fund posted no flows on Aug. 1, Aug. 4, Aug. 5, and Aug. 7, with minimal $6.4 million in activity on Aug. 8 and $2.7 million outflows on Aug. 6. REX Osprey’s fund is the first US-listed Solana ETF to integrate native staking mechanisms. The product operates outside standard SEC-registered spot ETF frameworks, delivering SOL exposure through indirect vehicles rather than direct crypto holdings. CoinShares flow data showed Solana products attracted $874 million in year-to-date inflows, staying behind Ethereum (ETH) and XRP among major cap altcoins despite its position as the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The trading pattern could reflect broader institutional hesitation toward Solana-focused investment products compared to Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum alternatives. Nansen senior research analyst Jake Kennis attributed the disparity to institutional portfolio allocation strategies. He explained in a note: “ETH is seeing a lot of new activity as institutions were likely underweight ETH relative to BTC. Solana has been mostly in the backseat for this new wave of attention, but SOL ETFs would likely pick up if institutions are looking to also diversify away from BTC and ETH.” The REX Osprey fund’s design incorporates staking mechanisms and offshore ETF allocations that differentiate it from traditional spot cryptocurrency products. Stabolut founder and CEO Eneko Knörr identified these features as adoption obstacles rather than demand deficiencies. Knörr said: “SSK’s quiet tape looks more like a brand and distribution issue than a pure demand problem. Its design isn’t a simple ‘spot SOL in a wrapper’—the fund stakes SOL and can allocate a portion into other SOL ETFs/ETPs, many offshore, which adds complexity that some buyers shy away from.” The fund charges a 0.75% management fee, positioning it at the higher end of cryptocurrency ETF expense ratios. Traditional spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs from major issuers typically carry fees between 0.15% and 0.25%. Kennis, from Nansen, noted that the fee structure creates a cost-benefit analysis for institutional investors weighing direct cryptocurrency exposure against ETF convenience. He referenced Solana’s approximately 7% annual staking rewards: “The staking component seems like a major feature given the ‘passive’ yield being left on the table.” The absence of major financial institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity in the Solana ETF space contributes to limited market penetration. REX Shares operates as a smaller ETF issuer without the distribution networks and brand recognition of Wall Street’s largest asset managers. Knörr argued: “Early trading will likely remain lumpy until bigger brands enter the space. Structure, complexity, and limited shelf space are holding it back—interest in Solana exposure itself doesn’t appear to be the issue.” As of Aug. 11, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is still considering the approval of Solana ETFs under the more tax-friendly 1933 Act.

Title: Why The Trump Administration MAGA Stock Dreams For Fannie And Freddie Could Be A Windfall For Wall Street

BySergei Klebnikov BySergei Klebnikov, Forbes Staff. The Trump administration is teeing up what could be the biggest shakeup in U.S. housing finance since the 2008 crisis—a pair of IPOs that might value Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac at a combined $500 billion. The plan, which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal and is still being finalized by the administration, would see the federal government sell between 5% and 15% of each company, potentially raising about $30 billion in what would be one of the largest stock offerings in American history. Yet behind the fanfare lies a precarious gamble on institutions still tethered to taxpayer support and whose profitability is largely cushioned by an implicit government guarantee. Senior administration officials have in recent days confirmed the plans are far along, though crucial structural decisions—such as whether to list the two separately or together—remain unresolved. President Trump himself has signaled his intention to proceed with the listings this year: “I am working on TAKING THESE AMAZING COMPANIES PUBLIC, but I want to be clear, the U.S. Government will keep its implicit GUARANTEES,” he wrote on social media last week. On Saturday, he posted an edited picture of himself ringing the opening bell at the NYSE for a hypothetical, combined entity called the Great American Mortgage Corporation trading under the ticker “MAGA.” The Treasury—which currently holds the bulk of both government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) equity—could release new shares, sell existing ones, or blend both strategies to create liquidity. Wall Street heavyweights such as JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, and Bank of America have reportedly been asked to advise on pricing and structure. The history of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is a cautionary tale. Fannie’s roots stretch back to 1938, Freddie’s to 1970; Both were designed to keep mortgage credit flowing by securitizing and guaranteeing home loans. Their business model—buying mortgages from lenders, bundling them into mortgage-backed securities and guaranteeing payment to investors—helped lower borrowing costs for generations of Americans. During the mid-2000s housing boom, both ramped up exposure to riskier loans and loosened underwriting standards, leaving them vulnerable when home prices crashed. During the housing bubble the top executives of these quasi-governmental agencies benefited from compensation packages in the tens of millions. By September 2008, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) had placed them into conservatorship after a combined $187 billion Treasury rescue, wiping out most private shareholder value. In the years since, the GSEs have returned to profitability, paying dividends that exceeded the bailout amount. Yet they have remained under government control, their retained earnings capped for much of the past decade until capital buffers were gradually rebuilt. FHFA’s 2024 Annual Report to Congress shows that by year-end, Fannie Mae’s total equity had grown $17 billion to $94.7 billion, while Freddie Mac’s climbed 24.8% to $59.6 billion. In a brief published earlier this year by Jim Parrott of the Urban Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, and Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics, the two highlighted the importance of keeping the implicit federal guarantee post-IPO. “Critical to the rating agencies and the Fed is not that the GSEs posed little risk, but that they enjoyed the unlimited backing of the U.S. government,” they write, warning that without that support, funding costs could climb sharply—driving up mortgage rates by 0.6 to 0.9 percentage points as well as shrinking credit access. The pair go on to caution that ending conservatorship without a clear legislative or financial framework risks delivering “no value,” and could leave the system “less liquid and stable.” “We believe it’s essential for the government to retain the explicit government guarantee if they pursue privatization, which could take years to implement,” wrote Lawrence Gillum, chief fixed income Strategist for LPL Financial. “Removing the guarantee would disrupt both markets and make housing even less affordable.” A $30 billion stock sale by the Federal government would provide a one-time boost to Treasury’s coffers but it would only represent an estimated 1.6% slice of the current fiscal year’s projected $1.9 trillion deficit. After the sale it is likely that the Federal government would still own 85% to 95% of the government sponsored mortgage companies and thus benefit from any appreciation in its share price. The windfall would also extend beyond the public purse. Hedge fund billionaires such as Bill Ackman and John Paulson, who built large positions in the mortgage giants years ago betting on their return to the market, could reap outsized rewards if the IPOs hit their targets. Ackman, who has long advocated for the privatization of the two GSEs, owns roughly 10% of the common stock of both Fannie and Freddie through his fund, Pershing Square Capital Management. Ackman’s firm first invested in Fannie and Freddie common stock in late 2013, roughly five years after they were put under government conservatorship during the financial crisis. His cost basis for each averaged just over $2 per share. Today, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae currently trade at $9 per share and $11.50 per share, respectively. According to previous filings from his firm (Pershing Square stopped disclosing these specific holdings in regular filings several years ago), he owned 115.5 million shares of Fannie and 63.5 million shares of Freddie—that stake today would be worth roughly $1.8 billion. Wall Street underwriters also stand to collect millions in advisory fees. Banks like Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase were top originators for Freddie and Fannie last year, while institutions like BlackRock and PIMCO are significant holders of mortgage backed securities. If the Trump administration pulls it off, the planned Fannie and Freddie offerings could rank among the most ambitious privatizations in modern U.S. history. Still, trying to privatize much of the nation’s mortgage infrastructure during the worst housing affordability crisis in a generation will be no easy task, as critics have pointed out. The current administration will no doubt need to be more specific and methodical than they have been so far if they want to avoid losing investor confidence and causing a shock to the financial system.
