Title: Wall Street banks are cashing in on trade war chaos

Banks are minting money from stock market whiplash. Goldman Sachs (GS), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), and Morgan Stanley (MS) pulled in more than $12 billion in equities trading revenue last quarter. That surpasses the peak of the post-pandemic trading boom, The Wall Street Journal (NWSA) reports. “So far, the business is performing very well and clients are very active,” Goldman CEO David Solomon told analysts. That activity is being driven by investors scrambling to recalibrate portfolios with each new signal on how President Donald Trump’s tariff plans might unfold. But inside the country’s biggest banks, first-quarter financial results tell a very different story — one where volatility isn’t a headwind, but a revenue engine. Yet despite the trading bonanza — and a modest rally in recent days — bank stocks remain deeply in the red. The sector is down roughly 15% year-to-date, compared with an 8% drop in the S&P 500 and a 13% decline in the Nasdaq. For investors, the question now is whether trading-fueled profits are a blip — or a turning point for the sector. Goldman Sachs opened the earnings floodgates Monday, reporting a 15% jump in profit to $4.74 billion, or $14.12 per share. That beat Wall Street expectations, and was powered by strong trading revenues. Posting results Tuesday, Bank of America (BAC) also outperformed, posting EPS of $0.90 on $27.37 billion in revenue. Like Goldman, it credited its trading division for the upside. CEO Brian Moynihan noted the bank is riding a wave of volatility, but warned that “we potentially face a changing economy in the future.” Citigroup (C) followed with a solid beat of its own: First-quarter net income of $4.1 billion, or $1.96 per share, on $21.6 billion in revenue — a 3% increase from the prior year. Results were strong across all five of Citi’s core businesses, with standout performances in its markets and wealth divisions. And last Friday, JPMorgan Chase announced earnings of $5.07 per share on $46.01 billion in revenue, with adjusted EPS of $4.91 excluding a one-time gain from the First Republic acquisition. Trading, investment banking, and asset management all helped drive the beat. Morgan Stanley that day reported net revenues of $17.7 billion, up from $15.1 billion a year earlier, also beating earnings estimates. It cited strong momentum in trading and wealth management, underscoring just how broad the gains have been across the financial sector — even if investor sentiment hasn’t yet caught up. BlackRock (BLK) also delivered: 12% top-line growth to $5.28 billion, adjusted EPS of $11.30, and record net inflows of $84 billion, led by iShares ETFs. The firm now manages $11.58 trillion in assets. So why are banks thriving amid all this chaos? In short: Volatility equals volume. When markets are choppy — as they’ve been throughout the first quarter, and even more so this month in the wake of Trump’s shifting tariff plans — investors rush to reposition their portfolios, hedging bets and chasing safer ground. That activity generates trading fees for banks, especially in their equities and fixed-income divisions. It’s a bit of a paradox: While market turmoil often hits consumer confidence and corporate dealmaking, it can be a windfall for bank trading desks tasked with executing those reactions. Still, a booming trading quarter (or two) doesn’t necessarily mean bank stocks are about to take off. Historically, financials tend to lag in recoveries, especially when the outlook for interest rates, credit quality, and economic growth is so murky. For instance, after the 2008 financial crisis, bank stocks took years to return to pre-crisis levels — while sectors such tech and consumer discretionary stocks bounced back much faster. And even in 2020, when trading revenues surged during pandemic volatility, that boost didn’t translate into lasting stock outperformance. For now, Wall Street banks are quietly riding the storm they didn’t directly create. Whether that success translates into enthusiasm for their own stocks is another question entirely, especially with economic risks still looming — and the full impact of tariffs yet to hit Main Street. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Bitcoin ETF market steadies as BlackRock sees modest inflows with only outflows from Fidelity
URL: https://cryptoslate.com/insights/bitcoin-etfs-break-even-after-april-outflows-1m-out-1m-in/

Market sees cautious optimism in Bitcoin ETFs as BlackRock compensates for Fidelity's outflows. Spot Bitcoin ETFs showed early signs of stabilizing in mid-April following an aggressive seven-day period of outflows exceeding $872 million triggered by intensified US-China trade tensions. After ETF withdrawals tapered on April 10 with $14.9 million in outflows, activity nearly halted on April 11, recording minimal outflows of just $1 million. This reduction indicated cautious market sentiment and an emerging pause among investors reassessing Bitcoin’s stability around the $85,000 mark. April 14 marked a turning point, ending the prolonged outflow streak with modest net inflows totaling $1.5 million. Notably, Fidelity’s FBTC ETF recorded substantial withdrawals of $35.2 million, highlighting continued profit-taking or strategic repositioning by certain institutional investors, reflecting lingering caution. In contrast, BlackRock’s IBIT ETF attracted $36.7 million, effectively offsetting Fidelity’s losses and signaling selective confidence returning to the ETF market. Overall, ETF market enthusiasm remains muted compared to previous bullish phases, indicating that investors remain watchful, awaiting clearer signals from both macroeconomic conditions and sustained Bitcoin price stability.

Title: Ripple’s Garlinghouse Believes Bitcoin’s Astronomical Breakout To $200,000 Is ‘Not Unreasonable’
URL: https://zycrypto.com/ripples-garlinghouse-believes-bitcoins-astronomical-breakout-to-200000-is-not-unreasonable/
Time Published: 2025-04-15T15:00:06Z
Full Content:
Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has predicted that Bitcoin’s mega explosion to the elusive $200,000 level is possible, as regulators in the United States have swiftly changed their approach to regulating crypto. “I think $200,000 is not unreasonable,” Garlinghouse told Fox Business on April 11, adding that he would not forecast the price of XRP, which powers the XRP Ledger, as it is “too close to home.” The apex cryptocurrency was recently changing hands around $84,183, representing a 2.1% gain over the past seven days, as per crypto data provider CoinGecko. The Ripple boss remarked that he avoids making short-term Bitcoin predictions as he is mainly focused on long-term macro trends. He expects macro tailwinds and the reversal of US regulatory animosity to continue propelling the crypto market higher: “I think about what the macro trends are playing out for the crypto industry, for the XRP ecosystem. XRP has been the best-performing major crypto in the last 90 days. We think about it as, what does that look like over the next three years? I’m very optimistic.” In Garlinghouse’s view, people underestimate the implications of the US economy on the crypto market. He highlighted that America, under President Donald Trump, has shifted from “headwinds, hostility” to “tailwinds,” yet the market hasn’t fully priced in the bullish impact of this regulatory change. “The largest asset managers in the world go from relatively frozen out or hostile to now a friendly market. This has sensible regulation that is thinking about pro-innovation here at home,” he opined. Garlinghouse credited David Sacks, Scott Bessent, and the newly confirmed Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chairman, Paul Atkins, for creating a more crypto-friendly regulatory scene. With the SEC under transformed leadership in the Trump administration, the regulatory landscape is undergoing tremendous changes. For instance, high-profile lawsuits against Coinbase, Robinhood, and Ripple have either been settled or dropped, signaling a new chapter for the industry. Commenting on Ripple’s recent $1.25 billion acquisition of prime broker Hidden Road, Garlinghouse claimed the company would not have signed the deal a year ago because of the hostile regulatory environment under the Biden-Harris administration. He suggests the acquisition could allow Wall Street giants to access crypto through traditional infrastructure. “This allows even larger institutions like BlackRock, like the biggest Wall Street financial institutions, to come into this market in a way they understand with a safer prime broker to help clear transactions and a bigger balance sheet to do that. It’s good for the whole industry,” he postulated.

Title: PDD Holdings: A Chinese E-Commerce Gem Trading At A Deep Discount
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/gurufocus/2025/04/15/pdd-holdings-a-chinese-e-commerce-gem-trading-at-a-deep-discount/

ByGuruFocus ByGuruFocus, Contributor. By Nabeel Bukhari Every so often, the market overlooks a company delivering on all fronts, and PDD Holdings (PDD, Financial) might be one of them. The company has quietly become one of the most interesting disrupters and has built a global empire, turning its platforms, Pinduoduo and Temu, into household names across continents. Moreover, the numbers speak for themselves in terms of soaring revenue, rising profits, and a balance sheet that provides it the flexibility to keep winning. Yet, the stock remains extremely undervalued. That kind of disconnect does not last forever. Under an aggressive expansion strategy and having proven the ability to do just that, PDD Holdings is changing the game. And as the company grows continuously, this one of the most fascinating stories in the world of e-commerce will become difficult to ignore. For those who are paying attention now, it's an opportunity that's too big to miss out on. PDD Holdings, the owner of Pinduoduo and Temu, is a major player in global e-commerce. It's a socially driven shopping platform in China that started in 2015 and has since become a disruptive force in the industry with its aggressive pricing and speed of expansion. However, the real game-changer came in 2022 when PDD Holdings launched Temu. It is a cross-border marketplace that has taken the world by storm and is now live in over 40 countries. There is no accident to Temu's meteoric rise. Its success has spiked with bargain-basement prices and treasure-hunt shopping experiences selling to millions of cost-conscious consumers. Even I had a great experience with it, and to say the least, the app is addictive. However, the growth at this scale comes with challenges, which you will later see in the analysis. That said, PDD Holdings is doing more than sitting back. It is making smart moves to diversify its revenue. Its recent partnership with DigitBridge will enable it to bring small-to-medium-sized businesses and assist them in simplifying e-commerce operations so that sellers can seamlessly join Temu. It could serve as a strategic play to strengthen Temu's future position. Heading towards financial performance, PDD Holdings just reported another strong quarter with revenue up 24% year-over-year (YOY) to $15.15 billion. That is a good number, but it was less than expectations and has been the slowest growth rate since early 2022. However, the company's fundamentals are still strong. The healthy consumer demand manifested itself in a 33% increase in revenue from transaction services. Meanwhile, the company is keeping profitability up despite rising costs, as operating profit rose 14% to $3.5 billion and net income jumped a solid 18% to $3.76 billion. PDD Holdings Income Statement Breakdown Chart Balance sheet strength and cost concerns: Moreover, PDD Holdings is in an enviable position on the balance sheet. Today the company boasts a whopping $45.4 billion in cash and short-term investments and its cash-to-debt ratio is a staggering 30.13. That's a fortress-like balance sheet that allows it to be aggressive with the capital, while still being financially secure. Further adding to this, the debt levels remain minimal, which is a great sign. PDD Holdings Balance Sheet Breakdown Chart Thad said, rising costs posing concern. Cost of revenue rose 36%, and if that is to be the trend, it might put pressure on margins. But this is not a red flag yet. A core bull case for PDD Holdings is that it has consistently found ways to remain profitable, and this is supported so long as its e-commerce and grocery delivery businesses are strong. There was already some caution going in on this report. The previous quarter had seen YOY growth but a sequential decline, and even the management had warned about a possible dip in the profits. Yet, PDD Holdings delivered where it needed to, that is, in earnings growth. It is likely that the holiday season helped, but posting strong profits while absorbing rising costs is a sign of a tough company. Looking ahead, investors should keep a close eye on how the company balances the two: expansion with cost control. If PDD Holdings continues its earnings momentum and keeps costs under control, the current valuation discount would be a positive rather than a negative. Beyond Q4, PDD Holding's full-year performance is particularly impressive. With strong growth in both online marketing services up 29% YOY and an astounding 108% YOY spike in transaction services revenue to $26.84 billion, fiscal year 2024 was a blockbuster for it. It's obvious that the company's aggressive expansion is paying off. Still, more impressively, operating profit soared 85% YOY to $14.85 billion while net income climbed a mind-boggling 87% to $15.4 billion, indicating the company had pulled it off despite increasing costs. Speaking of costs, operating expenses jumped 35% YOY to $18.02 billion, probably due to high marketing spend, but PDD Holdings still managed to increase margins substantially. The company has plenty of financial firepower to keep on investing in growth with $16.7 billion in operating cash flow. There's no doubt that PDD Holdings is balancing aggressive expansion with profitability, but with raising fulfillment and payment processing costs, sustaining this momentum without killing margins is the real challenge ahead. PDD Holdings currently appears to be a hidden gem in the market. The stock is trading at a steep 55.86% discount based on its GF Value of $201.63 compared to its current stock price of $88.97. That’s a significant gap, especially considering the company’s robust earnings growth. PDD Holdings GF Value Chart As for valuation metrics, PDD Holding’s trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 7.70 times is 38.83% below the sector median, and the forward P/E of 7.30 times is 44.81% below. In short, the stock is cheap, and even though it has delivered solid profits, the market may not be fully appreciating of the stock’s potential. Digging a bit further, enterprise-value-based multiples corroborate the story. PDD Holding’s forward EV/EBITDA of 4.44 times is at a 49% discount to the sector median of 8.72. Even more compelling is that its forward EV/EBIT of 4.42 times is at a 66% discount to the sector’s 13.11. These numbers reveal that PDD Holdings is not only profitable, but profitable at a valuation that seems quite modest. That said, there is one factor to watch. The company’s forward EV/Sales multiple of 1.21 times is 12.97% above the sector median of 1.07. It means investors are factoring in strong revenue growth already. If margins don’t come up to the levels of those expectations, then there could be some pressure on valuation. Ultimately, PDD Holdings has an amazing balance sheet and surging profitability, which makes the disconnect between its intrinsic value and the market price an opportunity to watch out for. Therefore, for now, the valuation screams opportunity, but execution will be the key here. Now, let’s compare MercadoLibre and Alibaba with PDD Holdings to determine who is a better value play out of the three. MercadoLibre is at a hefty premium, as its trailing P/E is 51.30 times and forward P/E almost 41.11 times, which is more than four times PDD Holding's valuation. While MercadoLibre's growth story is strong, that kind of premium pricing leaves close to no room for error. On the other hand, Alibaba’s trailing P/E of 11.94 times and forward P/E of 11.64 times are more reasonable but still slightly higher than PDD Holdings. The trend continues when we take a closer look at EV metrics. MercadoLibre's relatively high forward EV/EBITDA of 24.36 times and EV/EBIT (TTM) of 38.48 times indicate that there is a substantial premium. While EV/EBITDA at 8.17 times and EV/EBIT at 11.60 times for Alibaba is more moderate but again higher than PDD Holding’s levels. No matter how you slice it, PDD Holdings is trading at a discount. The gap remains wide on a revenue multiple basis. PDD Holding’s EV/Sales is a much lower figure than MELI’s 3.91 times or Alibaba’s 1.64 times. This makes it the most attractively valued of the three. PDD Valuation Ratio Comparison Chart When top investors make a move, it’s worth noting, and PDD Holdings has been on the radar of some big names. Institutions like BlackRock, Vanguard, and Baillie Gifford have large positions in the company, while billionaire investor David Tepper’s Appaloosa Management has also been adding to its stake. It is a powerful vote of confidence in PDD Holding's long-term potential. PDD Holdings Volume of Guru Trades The latest activity on guru trades is leaning bullish. Despite some investors taking profits, there is a notable uptick in buying which suggests that smart money sees value. The strong accumulation that took place in late 2024 and early 2025, particularly when the stock dipped, is a sign of conviction rather than hesitation. Heavyweights are standing firm and building on top of their positions, attracting long-term investors. And as already mentioned, when top investors back something up, that is usually for a reason. PDD Holdings EPS Quarterly Estimate Trends With that, here is where I see PDD Holding's stock trading over the next year. Over the next three years, PDD's forward P/E is estimated to drop steadily, from 7.33 times in 2025 to 5.29 times in 2027. The fact that earnings are expected to see strong growth is captured in this downward trend, and the consensus EPS estimates support it. As EPS continues to accelerate, PDD Holding’s stock could be substantially undervalued at the current levels and that’s where the opportunity comes. We would see a significant re-rating and a solid upside if sentiment shifts and investors start recognizing PDD Holding’s momentum. Base case-A conservative valuation re-rating: If I take, for example, a 2025 EPS estimate of $7.33 and apply a 9-10x forward P/E, which is in line with PDD Holding’s historical valuation range, we reach a price target of $108.54 to $120.60. It’s about 22% to 36% upside from current levels. The assumption in this scenario is that the execution remains steady but the market could still be cautious with PDD Holdings, preventing its multiple from expanding more rapidly. Bull case-A stronger growth premium: But how PDD Holdings would react if investor sentiment improves? That’s where things get interesting. A 12-13 times forward P/E suddenly looks reasonable if the stock begins to get valued like some of its higher growth peers. If PDD Holdings were to trade at 12 times, it would be worth $144.72 and 13 times would result in $156.78, which is a 63-76% upside. To drive this out, PDD Holdings would need to continue its current earnings and margin expansion and have investors competent enough to have faith in its long-term trajectory. PDD Scenario Analysis Even in the worst-case scenario, PDD offers a modest upside. However, if things go right and the market sorts itself eventually, the gains would be high. GuruFocus analysts also believe that there is an upside of 73.37%, with bullish targets even higher. This is one of those setups where patience becomes the key, and for long-term investors, PDD Holdings is an opportunity waiting to be discovered. PDD Holdings 12 Month Analyst Price Target Chart Not even the best growth stories are without risk, and the same is true of PDD Holdings. Right now, regulatory scrutiny is one of the biggest concerns. Temu is probed for product safety violations and alleged labor violations related to the supply chain in the U.S. The sales tactics of the firm are also being considered red flags by European regulators. If these problems become worse, PDD Holdings could be fined, restricted in operations, or experience a loss of reputation, all of which are obstacles to its long-term growth. Another wildcard is China's regulatory environment. PDD Holdings is a Variable Interest Entity (VIE) that allows foreign investment in Chinese companies. However, if Beijing goes too hard on this, PDD Holding's entire corporate setup could be at risk. And let’s not forget the competition. Alibaba and JD.com are already fighting back and slowing revenue growth. If PDD Holdings can't hold its edge, investors betting on its continued superiority may need to readjust their hopes. PDD Holdings is a compelling case being a high-growth, cash-rich e-commerce powerhouse trading at a steep discount. It is continuously executing, and delivering profitability even as it is aggressively investing. However, the market has not yet fully priced in its potential and that's the opportunity. There are risks, but they exist everywhere, isn't it? PDD Holdings has always been able to adapt and outperform. With earnings momentum still strong and institutional investors betting big, it is hard to ignore its upside. If the company stays on course, today's discount could become tomorrow's massive gain.

BREAKING: Judge finds probable cause to hold the Trump administration in contempt for violating deportation flights order Featured Shows MSNBC TV More Follow msnbc More Brands More Shows While most of the country spends Tax Day occupied with the stress of W2s, 1099s and tax-filing software, millionaires like us pay our tax attorneys top dollar to make sense of all the red tape for us. That doesn’t mean Tax Day isn’t still a nightmare for us, too, albeit for a different reason. For us, as Patriotic Millionaires, April 15 serves as a scary reminder of the rigged nature of America’s tax code. The U.S. tax system has enabled a concentration of wealth so extreme that it threatens our economy, our democracy and the planet. And this year’s Tax Day is even scarier, as Republicans are negotiating a tax bill that would further rig the system in favor of wealthy people like us and deepen America’s inequality crisis. According to Forbes’ 2025 Billionaires List, the U.S. has 902 billionaires whose combined net worth is a record $6.8 trillion. These 902 individuals hold more wealth than the entire bottom half of the country; their riches exceed the GDP of every country in the world aside from the U.S. and China. Our economy doesn’t stand a chance when this much money is concentrated in the hands of wealthy people like us. Of the many factors that drive America’s growing inequality, our tax code is among the most significant. For much of the 20th century, the U.S. had a fairly progressive tax structure that limited large, dynastic fortunes. That is no longer the case. Those who are already rich can make money in ways that are subject to income taxes at lower rates or don’t count as “income” at all (for example, by borrowing against unrealized capital gains). Billionaires now pay lower effective tax rates than all other income groups. For the ultrawealthy like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, paying $0 in federal income taxes isn’t outside the realm of possibility. Our organization, Patriotic Millionaires, has frequently sounded the alarm over the threat that wealth inequality poses to society. Our economy doesn’t stand a chance when this much money is concentrated in the hands of wealthy people like us. It leaves millions of working people without the incomes they need to buy products and services necessary for survival while also maintaining strong consumer demand. Our democracy doesn’t stand a chance when a mere 100 billionaire families are responsible for 1 out of every 6 dollars spent in federal elections, giving them an outsized voice and access to our elected officials and candidates for office. And our planet doesn’t stand a chance when the ultrawealthy can continue to accelerate climate change into overdrive with their private jets, superyachts and spaceships. The problem of extreme wealth has festered for years, if not decades, but it has taken on a new level of urgency with President Donald Trump and Elon Musk at the helm of the federal government. Billionaires subsidized Trump’s ticket back to the White House, accounting for no less than a third of the funds he raised. Musk alone contributed $235 million to Trump’s presidential bid. Now Musk and his fellow billionaires are getting major returns on their political investment, including the massive tax savings from the “big, beautiful” bill that the GOP is crafting. Last week, Republicans in the House and the Senate moved one step closer to passing their respective budget blueprints: Both of their plans would cut taxes by no less than $5 trillion, and most of those cuts would be used to extend many of the expiring provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act — a bill that overwhelmingly benefited the wealthy. If, as seems likely, the ultrawealthy receive another tax windfall from Republicans, it will only increase the threat that they pose to democracy. This would be bad news at any time and under any administration, but this is especially so under President Trump. Democracy is already hanging by a thread as the president targets perceived enemies, including universities, law firms and the media; purges the Justice Department of officials involved in criminal prosecutions against him; expresses interest in pursuing an unconstitutional third term in office; and declares himself a king on social media. To be clear, we don’t have a problem with wealth in and of itself. We make no apologies for our own financial success. People need financial incentives to innovate and work hard, and in the end, their ingenuity benefits all of us. There are several actions lawmakers must take to safeguard society from the ravages of extreme wealth concentration. What we do, however, have a problem with is a small handful of people having so much wealth that it inevitably becomes power. We have a problem with billionaires like Trump and Musk using the government to improve their own financial situations and business ventures. More than that, though, we have a problem with the fact that the tax code has done virtually nothing whatsoever to prevent the oligarchic crisis in which America finds itself. If our federal tax system continues to privilege income from wealth over income from work, and if Republicans get their way in passing even more tax cuts for the rich in the coming months, we’ll have baked a totally oligarchic concentration of wealth into America’s economic cake. There are several actions lawmakers must take to safeguard society from the ravages of extreme wealth concentration, but it is imperative they begin with reforming the tax code to ensure all millionaires and billionaires like us pay our rightful share in taxes. Paying taxes for the betterment of society is our civic duty that we are glad to do, because those who don’t have the wealth we have should be able to not only survive but thrive in our society. And with so much on the line, it is important that wealthy people carry out this sacred duty now more than ever. There’s no sugarcoating it: Tax Day is a nightmare. And thanks to what Trump, Musk and other ultrawealthy oligarchs are doing to our country, that nightmare has become recurring. To wake our country up and pull our economy, democracy and planet back from the brink of total collapse, lawmakers need to tax wealthy people like us before it’s too late.

The market just got nuked. After hitting record highs for months, we’re suddenly in the steepest selloff since COVID. Spoiler alert: This isn’t your typical correction. Let’s cut through the noise: these tariffs aren’t a bluff. When President Trump says, “I don’t want anything to go down, but sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something,” he’s signaling a willingness to endure pain to remake global trade. The numbers are staggering -145% on Chinese imports, followed by Beijing’s 125% retaliation. Source: PIIE This isn’t posturing; it’s economic warfare. What’s particularly jarring too, is the misapplication of economic theory. Brent Neiman, a University of Chicago economist, claims his research was "dramatically misapplied" by the Trump administration-using his framework incorrectly to justify these tariffs. Here's the uncomfortable reality: the U.S. trade deficit actually reflects the dollar’s role as the world’s reserve currency. Foreign entities currently hold about $7 trillion in U.S. Treasury securities. These deficits aren’t a bug-they’re a system feature. When assets that generally don’t correlate- Bitcoin, gold, tech stocks- all see a correction simultaneously like they did on 14 April, that's not rotation; that’s liquidity stress. What’s especially telling is the correlation spike across these usually uncorrelated assets. This isn't mere rotation; it's liquidity stress reminiscent of early COVID around 13 March. The market had priced in a near-perfect narrative: AI-fueled productivity, a soft landing, and geopolitical calm. That fairy tale is now unraveling. This isn’t just another policy adjustment-it’s the beginning of a profound shift in how capital flows internationally. The Triffin Dilemma-the structural paradox where the U.S. must run deficits to supply the world with dollars-is being challenged in real-time. Think about it: foreign central banks hold over $3 trillion in dollar reserves. If the U.S. were to successfully reduce its trade deficit (however unlikely), it could ironically create global dollar shortages, triggering worldwide financial instability. Why gold dropped and why smart money is still buying it Gold took a hit alongside everything else, but don’t misread the signal. It's not weakness—it's a liquidity crunch in action. What we’ve seen recently isn’t gold failing as a safe haven; it's a classic liquidity unwind. In moments of stress, gold often gets sold not because it's weak but because it's liquid. Essentially, it's the ATM traders go to during margin calls. The longer-term outlook remains bullish for gold, especially if trade fragmentation continues and central banks accelerate their diversification away from the dollar. The tariff situation has created a brutal dilemma for the Fed and other central banks. Initially, markets feared tariffs would reignite inflation and prompt more rate hikes. But the reality looks more like stagflation - higher prices with weaker growth. Do central banks hike into slowing growth or wait and risk inflation taking off again? The market is betting on paralysis, with rate hike probabilities recently declining. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, has even suggested the U.S. may already be in the early stages of a recession, echoing concerns from other influential figures. A CNBC survey found about 69% of CEOs believe a recession is either underway or imminent. In this environment, several opportunities stand out: This isn’t just market drama - it’s hitting Main Street. Some small businesses are already freezing orders or warning they can’t absorb new customs costs. Many could be pushed to the brink with thin margins and weak pricing power. If that spills into labor markets or retail consumption, this could evolve from a correction into something much broader. As the New York Times notes, companies dependent on importing goods from China are already in chaos due to soaring tariff rates. Information moves at warp speed now, and that’s changing how markets function. One false headline about tariff delays recently moved markets by trillions before being debunked. For traders, the edge isn’t just about knowing more - it’s about filtering better. The risk is no longer just being wrong, it’s being too reactive to the wrong signal. The bottom line? We’re not in Kansas anymore. The game’s rules are changing, and traders who recognise this shift early will be left standing when the dust settles. This isn’t just another dip to buy - it’s a fundamental rewiring of global markets. Proceed accordingly.

Zero Hash, a crypto infrastructure firm specializing in stablecoin payment rails, said it has processed over $2 billion in tokenized fund flows over the past four months as demand for real-world assets is accelerating. Tokenized real-world assets is a red-hot crypto sector, with several global traditional financial firms leveraging blockchain rails to record ownership and move assets such as securities, funds, commodities. They do so to achieve operational gains and near-instant settlements. It's forecasted to be huge opportunity: BCG and Ripple projected the market to grow to $18 trillion by 2033. Zero Hash's stablecoin infrastructure serves as a key backbone for tokenized assets, supporting tokenized funds from traditional asset managers including BlackRock, Franklin Templeton and Republic, enabling around-the-clock stablecoin transactions across 22 blockchains. That includes BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), Franklin Templeton’s BENJI, and the Hamilton Lane Private Infrastructure Fund. The company supports seven stablecoins and handles regulatory compliance requirements for its partners, positioning it as a backbone for asset managers deploying tokenized versions of traditional instruments like treasuries and private credit. The total value of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) on public blockchains reached $20.6 billion, up from $15.2 billion at the end of 2024, according to data from rwa.xyz. Zero Hash claimed it processed roughly 35% of that net inflow. "Tokenized finance is no longer theoretical," Zero hash founder and CEO Edward Woodford said in a statement. "Institutions are deploying real capital to tokenization and need the payment infrastructure to match.” Krisztian Sandor is a U.S. markets reporter focusing on stablecoins, tokenization, real-world assets.

Title: Unlimited Expands ETF Lineup with New Global Macro Hedge Fund Strategy

April 15, 2025 09:05 ET | Source: Unlimited Unlimited NEW YORK, April 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bob Elliott, CEO and CIO of Unlimited, today announced the launch of the Unlimited HFGM Global Macro ETF (NYSE: HFGM), a new actively managed exchange-traded fund offering exposure to global macro hedge fund style strategies. The Fund capitalizes on Mr. Elliott’s extensive experience as a systematic global macro portfolio manager by dynamically allocating capital long and short across a wide range of global markets opportunities in search of mispricing. The fund utilizes liquid exchange-listed futures contracts, and a basket of ETFs based upon systematic signals. The positions are adjusted based on evolving market conditions with the goal of adding diversification benefits to investors’ portfolios. HFGM seeks to capitalize on global market mispricing opportunities spanning currency, fixed income, equity, credit and exchange rate markets. Global macro managers have a long track record of generating consistent alpha with low correlation to the broader equity and fixed income markets. HFGM deploys Unlimited’s proprietary, data-driven technology to interpret the current positioning of global macro managers and replicate those positions in its own portfolio. The launch of HFGM expands on Unlimited’s mission to provide investors with access to hedge fund-style returns without the high fees and tax inefficiencies that can erode performance over time. Unlimited’s ETF offering includes the Unlimited HFND Multi-Strategy Return Tracker ETF (NYSE: HFND), which has a two-year track record of offering investors exposure to a broad set of hedge fund style strategies. “Financial advisors and institutional investors facing turbulent markets are looking for ways to diversify their portfolios, but many find the high fees, lack of liquidity and adverse tax treatment associated with traditional alts offerings untenable," said Mr. Elliott. "Our Global Macro ETF was designed to offer a volatility target aligned with equity markets as an investor-friendly way to add the diversification features of alts to a balanced portfolio.” Hedge fund strategies overall have historically generated strong uncorrelated returns for investors, but high fees combined with inefficient tax structures have significantly eroded that performance. HFGM offers a transparent, liquid, and cost-effective alternative to traditional hedge fund allocations, carrying a lower expense ratio than the standard "2 and 20" hedge fund fee model. HFGM is the first of several new actively managed ETFs the firm plans to launch over the coming months. The suite includes two additional strategies that have been approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission with launch plans in the works for later this year, Unlimited HFMF Managed Futures ETF and Unlimited HFEQ Equity Long/Short ETF. Unlimited’s ETFs are managed by Mr. Elliott, former investment committee member at Bridgewater Associates and Bruce McNevin, co-founder and Chief Data Scientist at Unlimited. Mr. McNevin brings extensive experience in quantitative modeling and data science, having held positions at hedge funds Clinton Group and Midway Group, as well as Bank of America and BlackRock. For more information on HFGM or HFND, please visit https://www.unlimitedetfs.com Media Contacts: Before investing you should carefully consider the Fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other information is in the prospectus. A prospectus may be obtained by visiting www.unlimitedetfs.com. Please read the prospectus carefully before you invest. Important Risks Underlying ETFs Risks. The Fund will incur higher and duplicative expenses because it invests in Underlying ETFs. There is also the risk that the Fund may suffer losses due to the investment practices of the Underlying ETFs. The Fund will be subject to substantially the same risks as those associated with the direct ownership of securities held by the Underlying .ETFs. Management Risk. The Fund is actively managed and may not meet its investment objective based on the Sub-Adviser’s success or failure to implement investment strategies for the Fund. Machine Learning, Model and Data Risk. The Fund relies heavily on proprietary “machine learning” selection processes. In addition, the composition of the Fund’s portfolio is heavily dependent on proprietary quantitative models as well as information and data supplied by third parties (“Models and Data”). Volatility Risk. The Fund seeks to achieve a higher level of volatility than its target hedge fund industry sector, which may result in substantial price fluctuations over short periods. As a result, the value of the Fund’s investments may rise or fall significantly, and investors should be prepared for increased levels of volatility compared to traditional equity funds. Commodity Risk. Underlying ETFs that invest in the commodities markets may be subject to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities. Derivatives Risk. The Fund’s or an Underlying ETF’s derivative investments have risks, including the imperfect correlation between the value of such instruments and the underlying assets or index; the loss of principal, including the potential loss of amounts greater than the initial amount invested in the derivative instrument; the possible default of the other party to the transaction; and illiquidity of the derivative investments. Emerging Markets Risk. The Fund may invest in Underlying ETFs that invest in securities issued by companies domiciled or headquartered in emerging market nations. Investments in securities traded in developing or emerging markets, or that provide exposure to such securities or markets, can involve additional risks relating to political, economic, currency, or regulatory conditions not associated with investments in U.S. securities and investments in more developed international markets. Fixed Income Securities Risk. The Fund may invest in Underlying ETFs that invest in fixed income securities. The prices of fixed income securities may be affected by changes in interest rates, the creditworthiness and financial strength of the issuer and other factors. An increase in prevailing interest rates typically causes the value of existing fixed income securities to fall and often has a greater impact on longer-duration and/or higher quality fixed income securities. Foreign Securities Risk. Foreign securities held by Underlying ETFs in which the Fund invests involve certain risks not involved in domestic investments and may experience more rapid and extreme changes in value than investments in securities of U.S. companies. Futures Contracts Risk. The Fund or Underlying ETFs may invest in futures contracts. Risks of futures contracts include: (i) an imperfect correlation between the value of the futures contract and the underlying asset; (ii) possible lack of a liquid secondary market; (iii) the inability to close a futures contract when desired; (iv) losses caused by unanticipated market movements, which may be unlimited; (v) an obligation for the Fund or an Underlying ETF, as applicable, to make daily cash payments to maintain its required margin, particularly at times when the Fund or Underlying ETF may have insufficient cash; and (vi) unfavorable execution prices from rapid selling. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Short Selling Risk. The Fund may make short sales of securities of Underlying ETFs, which involves selling a security it does not own in anticipation that the price of the security will decline. Short sales may involve substantial risk and leverage. Short sales expose the Fund to the risk that it will be required to buy (“cover”) the security sold short when the security has appreciated in value or is unavailable, thus resulting in a loss to the Fund. Short sales also involve the risk that losses may exceed the amount invested and may be unlimited. Swap Agreement Risk. The Fund or an Underlying ETF may invest in swap agreements. Swap agreements could result in losses if the underlying asset or reference does not perform as anticipated. Swaps can have the potential for unlimited losses. They are also subject to counterparty risk. If the counterparty fails to meet its obligations, the Fund (or the Underlying Fund) may lose money. Definitions: 20 and 2 strategy: Describes the standard fee structure charged by advisers of private funds, which generally includes a 2% asset-based management fee, in addition to a 20% performance fee charged on the profits on investments.

Title: Should India Follow the US and Establish a Bitcoin Reserve?

Photo Credit: Unsplash The valuation of the crypto sector currently stands at $2.7 trillion (roughly Rs. 2,31,56.903 crore) US President Donald Trump announced the creation of separate reserves for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the US last month, in a boost for the digital assets sector. The decision prompted Sweden and South Korea to open dialogue around considering Bitcoin as a potential reserved asset. There's currently no word on whether the Government of India is planning to establish a strategic crypto reserve. Gadgets 360 discussed the possibility of India's Bitcoin reserve with Polygon and Avail co-founders Sandeep Nailwal and Anurag Arjun. Polygon founder Nailwal said that US President Donald Trump has kickstarted a race to acquire Bitcoin and other altcoins for long-term benefits to the US economy. He said that India, which is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, may regret its conservative approach on crypto if it fails to catch up with other big economies in a timely manner. “The world is long past the days when Bitcoin was considered an experiment or simply a haven for criminals. Some of the world's largest asset managers, sovereign wealth funds, and national governments have invested large amounts of money in BTC and the broader altcoin market, indicating the rising adoption of the asset class,” Nailwal told Gadgets 360. Abu Dhabi's investment company, Mubadala and Norway's Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM) are prominent financial firms that have begun to deal with Bitcoin via investments in pro-crypto firms like MicroStrategy, Tesla, and BlackRock's Bitcoin ETFs. In India, Mumbai-based IT training firm Jetking has acquired Bitcoin tokens worth Rs. 10 crore. The January 2025 edition of the World Bank's Global Economic Prospects (GEP) report projected India's economy to grow at a steady rate of 6.7 percent in both FY26 and FY27, significantly outpacing global and regional peers. The IMF also estimates India's growth to remain robust at 6.5 percent for 2025 and 2026. "India can seriously consider creating a crypto stockpile to diversify its reserves and elevate the integration of blockchain with its economic ecosystem," Nailwal said. However, Polygon chief also cautioned that the authorities need to strengthen tech infrastructure, cybersecurity, and introduce a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies before establishing a crypto reserve. Existing gaps in crypto awareness, legal provisions, and enforcement of criminal punishments could pose risks to India's financial stability if crypto is considered as a reserved asset. India can allocate one to two percent of its foreign exchange reserves to crypto assets as a pragmatic starting point, Avail Co-Founder Anurag Arjun told Gadgets 360. Avail is a blockchain firm that supports the design of Web3 applications. Arjun also co-founded Polygon alongside Nailwal in 2017 but exited the firm in 2023. "India needs to see the creation of a crypto reserve as more than just about jumping on a trend. It's more about positioning India strategically in a rapidly evolving global financial landscape," Arjun said. “An small allocation of India's foreign exchange reserves to crypto makes for a modest exposure that limits risk while enabling India to experiment strategically, mirroring institutions like BlackRock (managing $50 billion in Bitcoin ETFs) and corporations like MicroStrategy, whose stock surged 1,500 percent after adopting Bitcoin as a treasury reserve. In the short term, such a move would position India as a forward-thinking economy, attracting blockchain innovation and global capital,” he added. Avail's co-founder also highlighted that Bitcoin's fixed supply of 21 million tokens offers protection against inflationary pressures in traditional currencies, serving as a hedge against monetary instability in an increasingly uncertain world. “With 17 percent of the global population and a tech-savvy workforce, India has the demographic and intellectual capital to lead rather than follow. Digital assets offer a hedge against dollar hegemony, a tool for financial inclusion, and a bridge to the digital economy—critical for sustaining growth in a digitising world. A late entry into the race would mean acquiring assets at significantly higher prices, placing India at a strategic disadvantage,” he added. India is also at liberty to keenly analyse US' step of putting seized crypto funds into its crypto reserves. In February this year, India's Enforcement Directorate (ED) seized its biggest crypto fund worth Rs. 1,646 crore investigating a money laundering case. Other similar probes have also roped in hefty crypto funds that have been placed under the custodies of Binance, ZepPay, WazirX, and CoinDCX. Nimen Shah, a senior chartered accountant and international tax advisor from Mumbai, said India's financial position is on solid ground, which eliminates any urgency for it to venture into creating crypto reserves. "Cryptocurrencies are volatile and still largely unregulated. They enable private financial transactions without the involvement of any central bank or broker, making them susceptible to misuse by criminals. Because crypto lets individuals process financial transactions without an intermediary, it threatens the autonomy and control of central banks on a global level," Shah told Gadgets 360. Over the last few years, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) lifted its ban on crypto, while the government introduced a 30 percent tax on cryptocurrency incomes, which has been criticised by many crypto investors. In 2024, former RBI governor Shaktikanta Das called crypto risky and highly speculative, addressing the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman also stated last year that crypto cannot be viewed as a legitimate currency in India. “India need not rush into a creating a crypto reserve. Given the apprehensions of the RBI and other stakeholders, it would be a very long leap to go from zero regulations to crypto reserves,” Shah said, while dismissing the idea of crypto becoming an alternative to the US dollar for India. He said that crypto activities are more intensive in the US than in India. “Crypto is not big enough either as an industry or as an acceptable enough asset class to impact our monetary policy or our financial system. We are a long way away from there,” Shah added. As of Tuesday, the valuation of the crypto sector stood at $2.7 trillion (roughly Rs. 2,31,56.903 crore) with over 13 million tokens in circulation. Bitcoin, the most expensive crypto token, is presently trading at $85,600 (roughly Rs. 73.4 lakh).

Title: ‘You couldn’t make it up’: Customers told publican of plan to demolish his business for Cork Luas route

Time Published: 2025-04-15T12:31:51Z

A publican has said he learned from customers that his business might be acquired and demolished as part of the proposed €2 billion Luas Cork project. Con Dennehy, who runs the Venue Bar in Ballintemple with his partner Kate Tierney, said he thought it was a late April Fool’s prank when he heard Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) had earmarked the bar for demolition as part of its “emerging preferred route” (EPR) for the light rail system. A 39-page TII document outlines the proposed route for Luas Cork, which would see it running down the Cork Docklands towards Páirc Uí Chaoimh and towards Ballintemple village, where the Venue has operated for more than 100 years. “The EPR then crosses Blackrock Road and on to Churchyard Lane where a portion of landtake will be required to facilitate the alignment,” it notes. “This includes the acquisition of the Venue Bar, a well-known Ballintemple landmark. It is proposed to reinstate this corner site as part of the works.” Mr Dennehy told The Irish Times he was inundated with texts and screenshots of a page from the document on Monday while the proposed route was being officially announced by Taoiseach Michéal Martin and Minister for Transport Darragh O’Brien at Cork City Hall. “I said to Kate ‘Is this April first or what?‘,” he said. “One of the staff rang then and said ‘When were ye going to tell me the bar is going to be demolished?‘. They thought we knew about it but we knew nothing at all about it. It was the first we heard of it.” He said he arrived at the bar at 2pm and there was a letter from TII with a brochure and maps outlining the plan. Mr Dennehy and Ms Tierney have run the Venue for 10 years and the pub is popular with GAA and music fans due to it being a five-minute walk from Páirc Uí Chaoimh and the Docklands site where the Live at the Marquee concerts are held. He said the planned acquisition of his premises could have serious implications for the business. While he and Ms Tierney have no immediate plans to sell the pub, Mr Dennehy said it could put off potential buyers should they seek to do so in the future. Mr Dennehy said he had not yet read through the entire consultation document, but the Venue appears to be one of only two or three businesses named and identified for acquisition. “What I find absolutely amazing about this is that yesterday’s event was the launch of a public consultation process and they don’t see fit to consult or inform people directly affected by their plans. You couldn’t make it up,” he said. In a statement, TII said Monday’s launch was the start of a consultation period for the EPR and it was committed “to engaging fully with all stakeholders as the project is refined and developed. “We informed Mr Dennehy at the earliest opportunity about the impact which the proposed scheme would have on his property,” it said. “It is TII’s policy to inform all affected stakeholders at the same time and Mr Dennehy was treated no differently to any of the other affected stakeholders.” TII said it intended to be fair and transparent and that affected stakeholders should “contact us at their earliest convenience so we can discuss their individual situations”.

Title: Will Bitcoin Serve Main Street Or Wall Street In The Future?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/04/15/will-bitcoin-serve-main-street-or-wall-street-in-the-future/

ByMax (Chong) Li ByMax (Chong) Li, Contributor. Bitcoin is the world's largest cryptocurrency and received approval from the US Securities and ... More Exchange Commission to allow bitcoin exchange-traded funds. (Photo illustration by Chesnot/Getty Images) Is Bitcoin still a tool for financial freedom, or is it quietly being absorbed by the system it sought to disrupt? To unpack the discourse of this ideological tension, I recently had an intriguing chat with Sky Wee, the founder of Sky Ventures Labs that does early stage investment and a key opinion leader who has been instrumental in promoting the adoption of blockchain technologies and digital currencies. Originally rising to prominence in gaming and esports, Sky Wee gained a massive following across Southeast Asia and now advises a wide range of global Web3 projects. He has also been recognized as a Forbes 30 Under 30 honoree. For years, Bitcoin stood as a symbol of rebellion—a decentralized answer to central banks, inflationary currencies, and overreaching governments. But as institutional giants like BlackRock, Fidelity, and sovereign wealth funds embrace it, we’re left with an uncomfortable and often controversial question: Is Bitcoin still the people’s money, or is it becoming Wall Street’s asset? Sky Wee is a longtime Bitcoin advocate and decentralization idealist. Our conversation revealed both the hopes and hard truths about Bitcoin’s evolving identity. Some people may not fully agree with Sky Wee’s views, but the dialogue on this ultimate topic in the industry is thought-provoking and everlasting. The latest cycle of bear market and global geo-tensions would only make it a more interesting area to watch. “Bitcoin was always meant to be a hedge against the traditional financial system,” Sky Wee said. “What’s happening now is that the system itself is starting to acknowledge its value.” It’s a fair point. The entry of ETFs and corporate treasuries doesn’t necessarily invalidate Bitcoin’s purpose—it reinforces it. Yet, as a realist, someone can’t help but notice the shift in tone and control. Bitcoin may still be permissionless in code, but its ownership patterns are beginning to mirror those of traditional assets. Sky Wee added: “Bitcoin doesn’t care who owns it. It remains “people’s money” as long as people keep holding it.” True, but therein lies the catch. If everyday users opt for convenience over sovereignty—opting for custodial ETFs instead of self-custody—the protocol may remain decentralized, but the power structure around it won’t. When asked about DeFi maximalists, those who advocate for decentralized finance, and their worries that institutional adoption will concentrate Bitcoin supply, Sky Wee acknowledged the concern—but reframed the risk. “The real risk isn’t institutions buying—it’s retail not buying.” It’s a provocative take. After all, the 21 million cap remains fixed, and no entity, no matter how powerful, can alter Bitcoin’s monetary policy. But ownership matters. The fewer hands that hold it, the more sway those hands may have—not over the protocol, but over its narrative, its markets, and its future. So what does all of this mean for the average person? “Institutions accumulating Bitcoin signals long-term value,” Sky Wee argued. “It brings credibility, easier access, and a higher price floor. But individuals still have the edge—they can self-custody without permission.” It’s a compelling vision: Wall Street may build the roads, but the retail crowd still controls the steering wheel—if they choose to. Yet history has shown us how quickly early adopters can be priced out, and how infrastructure built by institutions often reinforces institutional dominance. The promise of accessibility could turn into a façade of inclusivity. Sky Wee’s perspective is clear: institutional adoption, while potentially transformative, doesn’t necessarily betray Bitcoin’s core principles. He acknowledges the influx of liquidity and legitimacy, but stresses, “Bitcoin is still permissionless. It doesn’t care who owns it. The real shift is whether retail investors continue accumulating or if they let big players dominate. Bitcoin remains people’s money as long as people keep holding it." While not entirely idealistic, I do think Bitcoin, and a wider range of digital currencies, have significant implications and value as digital gold. To this extent, I am fully in support of its significance. But I also acknowledge the growing and obvious fact that institutional adoption makes mainstream adoption easier, but also makes its centralization into institutions’ hands inevitable. Use Bitcoin mining as a simple example: one used to be able to run on his/her own PC to mine Bitcoin, but look at the threshold and barrier now: all high-tech machines operating as a farm in Texas, Norway, purchase of the advanced AI chipsets, it’s a game reliant on capital and tech which is already out of ordinary people's reach. And, electricity price manipulation can already manipulate the BTC price. The broader pattern is familiar. Every industrial, digital, or on-chain revolution opens doors for those previously excluded—first through knowledge, then tools, then access. But eventually, consolidation follows. To Sky Wee, the question of Bitcoin’s institutional entanglement isn’t whether it serves Wall Street—it’s about who needs whom. “In the short term, yes. We’re already seeing Bitcoin move with macro trends like interest rates and stock market cycles. But Bitcoin’s fundamentals haven’t changed—it still has a fixed supply, still operates on a decentralized network, and still runs 24/7, unlike traditional markets. Long-term, Bitcoin doesn’t need Wall Street. But Wall Street needs Bitcoin. The more the traditional system struggles, the clearer it becomes that Bitcoin is the exit strategy.”

Title: British Insurer Marshmallow Valued at $2 Billion With BlackRock Backing

British car insurance startup Marshmallow has almost doubled its valuation to more than $2 billion after a funding round that was backed by new investors BlackRock, Columbia Lake Partners and Portage. The firm, which offers insurance to under-served customers such as immigrants, raised $90 million in a mix of equity and debt to fund its expansion into new markets and products, according to a statement Tuesday. Marshmallow has raised money three years after its previous round, at a time when numerous other fintechs are accepting lower valuations or even backing off from fundraising until the economic outlook settles. Meanwhile, Britain’s biggest general insurers have been consolidating as firms struggled to raise premiums as quickly as cost inflation. Co-founder Oliver Kent-Braham said in an interview with Bloomberg News the funds will help Marshmallow to extend its offering to home insurance and lending products including motor finance in the coming months. The fintech is also exploring international growth in markets like the U.S., Canada and Germany. “We’ve got a very deep understanding of our customer group,” Kent-Braham said. “Our approach means that our technology is so much more nimble and flexible that we’ve managed to continue to grow over the last few years. As we’ve been maturing, we have been able to cross that profitability barrier.” Kent-Braham, along with his twin brother Alexander and software engineer David Goaté, set up Marshmallow in 2017 to help under-served groups access car insurance. The London-headquartered insurance firm has insured 1 million drivers to-date and said it has a turnover run rate of more than $500 million. The firm has 700 employees based in London and Budapest and is hiring across teams including engineers, analysts and motor claims handlers. Topics Carriers

Why is June the next key deadline to watch for a potential catalyst for ETH? The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has delayed decisions on staking and in-kind redemption for Ethereum [ETH] ETFs (exchange-traded funds). The agency sought more time on the staking application on two Grayscale spot ETH ETFs. As a result, the deadline has been extended to the 1st of June. The issuer made the application in February. Others like Bitwise, VanEck, 21Shares, Fidelity, Invesco Galaxy, and Franklin Templeton had applied for similar staking provisions for their respective ETH ETF products. As of this writing, only BlackRock has not applied for the same. But Robert Mitchnick, BlackRock’s head of digital assets, had publicly acknowledged the benefit of staking for the products. The regulator also delayed decisions on in-kind creation and redemption for ETH ETFs and BTC ETFs. In-kind redemption, unlike current cash settlements demanded by Gary Gensler-led SEC, ensures the use of underlying assets like ETH or BTC. The in-kind method avoids taxable events and enhances liquidity. The regulator pushed the in-kind decision deadline to 3rd June. That said, the SEC’s crypto task force has held roundtable discussions with key players, including Jito, MultiCoin Capital, and BlackRock, about crypto ETF staking and in-kind redemption. Source: Coinglass Meanwhile, the update didn’t spur any change in ETH’s speculative interest. According to Coinglass data, Open Interest (OI) has been on a decline since February, dropping from nearly $26B to below $20 billion. This meant that the bearish sentiment persisted even after the update. On the 4-hour price chart, ETH chalked a bearish rising wedge, which could drag it below $1500 again if the pattern is validated. However, reclaiming $1.8K could allow bulls to advance further.

Title: Quelle Surprise: Three Days After Milei Signs Another Unpayable IMF Bailout, US Treasury Secretary Pays Argentina a Call

The US has one clear goal in sight: to get Argentina to sever its ties with China, particularly by terminating a long-standing currency swap agreement. As we warned just over a month ago, the wheels are beginning to fall off the Mileis’ faux libertarian clown bus. But if anything, the freakshow is getting weirder. Last Friday (11/04), as the country experienced its third general strike since Javier Milei’s government took office 16 months ago, Milei gave a televised address to the nation. Flanked by his senior cabinet members, Milei told the Argentine people that his government had finally lifted the currency controls that had plagued the economy since 2011 so that people can once again buy dollars unhindered. Economic stability, he said, had finally returned to the country — all thanks to another, ahem, IMF bailout, Argentina’s 23rd since becoming a member of the fund in 1956. Fake Libertarians Celebrate While IMF Staffers Refuse to Sign Off To my knowledge, this is the first time that an Argentinean government, or indeed any national government, has responded to an IMF bailout with jubilant celebrations. Normally, an IMF bailout is the last resort for a government that has run out of options, not the beginning of a new golden age, as the Milei government is trying to present it. The fact that the Milei government in is filled with pseudo-libertarians to whom the IMF should be anathema makes it all the more surreal. Argentina’s Finance Minister Luis Caputo, a serial debtor and former JP Morgan Chase banker who already burdened Argentina with a $57 billion IMF loan in 2018, even thanked his wife and children for their support during the negotiations, as if he were winning a lifetime award. At the same time, some senior IMF staffers were so opposed to the deal that they were willing to walk away from their jobs, according to La Política Online (LPO): The opposition that this situation generated among the staff of the organisation, led to the firing of several management cadres. First it was the Chilean Rodrigo Valdés, who as director of the Western Hemisphere was the persion who naturally had to lead the Argentine case. Valdés is a consistent critic of Argentina’s hyper-indebtedness favoured by the Fund. And now it has emerged that Turkey’s Ceyla Pazarbasiogluel, the director of the IMF’s Strategy, Policy and Review Department (SPR), refused to sign off on the new loan. In her place, two minor officials intervened to trigger the loan. “Totally outside the manual,” the Fund itself acknowledged to LPO. The SPR is known as the “alpha male” of the IMF’s departments, or the IMF’s “politburo” — metaphors that illustrate its enormous power behind the scenes, since no major report can be published without its approval, as a former member of that committee revealed in an article in the Financial Times. The IMF’s original $57 billion bailout of Argentina in 2018 was already the biggest in the Fund’s 81-year history. At the time, many warned that Argentina would end up bailing on the bailout. As my former WOLF STREET colleague Wolf Richter wrote at the time, “No one should ever lend dollars to Argentina, not even the IMF. This always ends the same way: in a default.” And so it proved. In recent weeks, a default was looking more and more likely. The Central Bank of the Argentina Republic (BCRA) had burnt through more than $40 billion of the country’s foreign exchange reserves in a futile attempt to keep the peso artificially high, and thus inflation (in pesos) artificially low. In the process, it had not only run out of reserves, it had taken them into negative territory, and was now auctioning off other state assets to contain the run on the dollar. Now, even senior staffers at the IMF are warning about the risks of doubling down on the Fund’s exposure to Argentina’s debt. Buried within the text of the new agreement is an admission by the Fund itself that Argentina’s even more bloated debt load is practically unpayable. From LPO: What is striking is that even without Pazarbasiogluel’s signature on the contract, the SPR warns in the fine print of the agreement about the risk of the IMF’s larger than ever exposure to Argentina. The Fund’s maximum credit to Argentina, assuming disbursements are made as scheduled, is projected to reach 1,352% of the country’s quota in 2026. This would be the Fund’s largest exposure in absolute terms in its history. Argentina is receiving loans not just from the IMF but also the World Bank and the Inter-American Bank, all of which will have their own sets of terms and conditions. The IMF will be providing just under half of the total $42 billion bailout ($20 billion) while the World Bank will chips in an extra $12 billion, and the IAB, $10 billion. The latest loan package increases Argentina’s total debt to multilateral institutions to over $80 billion. Needless to say, attached to the IMF bailout are all the usual structural adjustment reforms (pensions reform, labour reform, fast-tracked privatisations, tax reforms and currency devaluation…) that the IMF itself admitted almost a decade ago don’t work yet continues to apply. Javier Milei, who before entering politics described the IMF as as a “perverse institution”, will happily abide. Loosening Currency Controls “Today we are breaking the cycle of disillusionment and disenchantment and are beginning to move forward for the first time,” Milei said. “We have eliminated the exchange rate controls on the Argentine economy for good.” Even in the most generous of readings, this is only partially true. Some currency controls not only remain in place but appear to have got even tighter. A statement issued by the central bank on Friday suggested that the loosening of currency controls will not apply to those who use cash. In order to be able purchase foreign currency banknotes, the central bank said that “customers’ use of local currency cash must not exceed the equivalent of USD 100 (one hundred US dollars) in the calendar month for all entities and for all the indicated purposes.” In other words, the currency exchange controls not only remain in place but will actually intensify for anyone using cash — before the latest IMF bailout, Argentineans could exchange up to 200 dollars worth of pesos in cash per month. Needless to say, $100 does not get you far in today’s Argentina, which thanks to Milei’s policies has became the most expensive country in dollar terms in Latin America. Government representatives have since countered that citizens and businesses will be able to buy unlimited sums of dollars and send them overseas — but only using online banking. This is great news, of course, for well-heeled corporations and investors, including those who have made huge returns by betting on the roughly 30 percentage-point interest rate differential between Argentina and the US — all made possible by the Milei government’s unsustainable policy to keep the peso artificially high against the dollar. Just as happened in 2018, it looks like an IMF loan is about to be used to finance capital flight out of the country. In 2018, the then-Macri government’s prior lifting of capital controls allowed the financial speculators who had invested in Argentine bonds to get their money out of the country before the next default. It’s a different story for the legions of Argentineans who don’t use online banking, preferring instead to have their savings, mainly in dollars, outside the banking system. This is largely because of their well-earned distrust of the banking system. It was, after all, only a generation ago that President Fernando De la Rúa imposed brutal restrictions on the withdrawal of money from banks, which would come to be known as “el corralito”. As inflation surged following repeated devaluations, many Argentines lost their life savings. Today, more and more people who do have bank accounts are having their bank accounts frozen due to failure to pay all their taxes on time or comply with the ever more onerous tax obligations. As we’ve reported previously, Milei’s government, despite its libertarian pretensions, has massively increased the tax burden during its 16 months in office, especially for lower and middle classes. Another way Argentineans will be instantly impacted by the bailout deal is through devaluation of the Argentine peso, and the resulting inflation it will fuel. One of the conditions of the IMF bailout is that the Milei government and central bank allow the Argentine peso to trade within a so-called currency band ranging from 1,000 to 1,400 pesos per dollar. On its first day of trading within the band, the official exchange rate fell 12%. It will probably fall a lot further. Just two months ago, Milei said there was no way his government would devalue the peso. De ninguna manera https://t.co/3pgcrSHZFB pic.twitter.com/xfESYCiF5W — Arrepentidos de Milei (@ArrepentidosLLA) April 14, 2025 The upshot of all this is that Argentina is likely to see a sharp resurgence in inflationary forces in the months to come. The Milei government’s most touted achievement — its supposed taming of inflation, achieved through the brutal application of austerity — was totally unsustainable. Inflation was already beginning to surge back in recent months. The country continues to boast the highest official inflation rate of any country not at war, and Milei is now talking about bringing price inflation to zero by mid-2026. Only his most committed followers will believe him. Meanwhile, the austerity will intensify. The only way the government has of bringing inflation under control is to kill the economy, and even that’s not working. US Secretary of State Pays a Call On Monday, just three days after the IMF mission left Argentina, the US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent arrived. It is unusual for a US treasury secretary to visit third countries, especially those with smallish economies, notes the Argentinean sociologist Atilio Boron in an essay on the possible reasons for Bessent’s visit. Besides participating in multilateral fora such as meetings of the G7, the G20, and the IMF, treasury secretaries rarely travel in an official capacity to countries that are not of decisive importance to the functioning of the global economy. Which is why the visit of Donald Trump’s Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to Argentina yesterday (14/04) raised a few eyebrows, especially given the turbulent global economic and geopolitical backdrop. As trade officials in Washington awaited the arrival of Maros Sefcovic, the trade chief of the European Union, one of the US’ biggest trade partners with nearly $1 trillion in two-way trade last year, Bessent was sitting down to do business with Javier Milei, the president of a country that accounts for a mere $16.3 billion in total annual trade with the US. It’s not hard to see why. The obvious answer, says Boron, is China: In keeping with Trump’s full frontal attack against Beijing — once a mere economic competitor and now an apex enemy, as characterized by numerous official US documents – Bessent will surely repeat the three magic words of the White House, uttered by both Biden and Trump alike: “keep China out”. “A Very Interesting Partner” As readers may recall, Milei was initially hostile to the mere notion of doing business with the “murderous” regime in Beijing. But he gradually warmed to the idea as he realised how much Argentina’s economy and finances depended upon China, its second largest trade partner. By October last year, as dollars were drying up, Milei even began singing Beijing’s praises as efforts begun to relaunch Argentina’s strategic economic agreement with China. “China is a very interesting trading partner. They do not make demands, the only thing they ask is that they not be bothered.” In others words, general non-interference — the diametric opposite to how the US has traditionally engaged with its Latin American neighbours. Milei was also seemingly impressed by Chinese efficiency, saying: “We had a meeting with the ambassador (Wang Wei) in June, the next day they unlocked the swap,” referring to the rescheduling, last June, of the payments corresponding to an activated tranche of the currency swap that both nations are keen to maintain. But the US wants to gut that bilateral swap, and is apparently willing to use the IMF bailout as a bargaining chip. In a recent trip to Argentina, the US State Department’s head of Latin America, Mauricio Claver-Carone, cited the ending of Argentina’s swap line with China as a key condition for an explicit endorsement of the Trump administration for the IMP bailout. “We want to make sure that no agreement with the Monetary Fund ends up prolonging that line of credit or that swap they have with China,” said Claver-Carone. “If we do that, we are shooting ourselves in the foot.” Washington sees the swap line as an “extortion mechanism,” which is ironic given how Washington uses the IMF in exactly that way. In 2020, Claver-Carone, in the same role for the first Trump Administration as he has today, openly admitted that the US’s decision to grant the $57 billion loan requested by Mauricio Macri’s government in 2018 was largely based on geopolitical considerations. That loan was granted despite the fact that the funds were clearly going to be used for electoral purposes. From Infobae: Donald Trump considered Mauricio Macri a key player on the geopolitical chessboard of Latin America and used all his institutional power to support his Cambiemos government, which was in a bind due to recessionary conditions that could open the door to a Peronist victory in the approaching elections. Trump intended to block a return of the Justicialist Party to the Casa Rosada, since such a government would complicate his plans to end Nicolás Maduro’s regime in Venezuela. For the White House, a victory for Cristina Fernández… could bring back a populist axis — Argentina, Venezuela and Cuba — and affect US interests in the region. In this respect, the president of the United States not only supported Macri in public, but also secretly used all his global influence to get the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to break all its financial limits and grant Argentina a historic credit of more than 55,000 million dollars. In an interview with Bloomberg yesterday, Bessent praised Milei for working to bring down barriers towards reciprocal trade with the United States. He also admitted that the US is seeking to prevent Latin American countries from giving up their mining rights to China in return for aid. The unsaid part: those rights would be much better used in the hands of US, Canadian, European and Australian companies. “China has signed a number of these rapacious deals marked as aid, where … they’ve taken mineral rights. They’ve added huge amounts of debt onto these countries balance sheets,” he said. “They’re guaranteeing that future generations are going to be poor and without resources. And we don’t want that to happen any more than already has in Latin America.” This is all part of the collective West’s China debt trap lie that won’t die, as Conor documented in 2023: While Beijing certainly seeks influence in countries where it lends, it also usually builds infrastructure. And while those roads, train tracks, ports and more are also usually beneficial to Chinese operations, their construction also helps the host country. It’s also way more than the West offers in terms of infrastructure. There are, of course, other possible motives for Bessent’s presence. Perhaps, writes Boron, he visited Argentina to carry out an on-the-ground inspection of the possibility of dollarizing the Argentine economy, just at a time when the dollar is losing ground in the global economy: Dollarizing was one of Milei’s campaign pledges. Isn’t it possible that Trump, in great need of allies in this part of the world, has decided to bind Argentina to the US by taking advantage of the fact that its current government, imbued with a deep colonial mindset, would be more than happy to put an end to the peso – described by Milei as excrement — and replace it with the dollar? The USD already legally prevails as legal tender in Ecuador, El Salvador and Panama. Adding Argentina, the region’s third-largest economy, to that list would be a formidable victory for Washington. And it could be done at negligible cost to the empire. A third possible motive flagged by Boron is that the US turns Argentina into a full-fledged military outpost. Given the country’s geostrategic position, on the doorsteps of the Antarctic and sharing the “Triple Frontier” with Brazil and Paraguay, a key border in South America in terms of population, movement of people and international relations, this is a distinct possibility: Is it outlandish to imagine that Bessent has come to demand, in exchange for the Argentine bailout, authorisation to install several US military bases in different parts of the country – especially in Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego – in order to control access to Antarctica and the bioceanic passage in the event of a conflict in the Panama Canal zone, without having to negotiate anything with its devalued NATO partners stationed in the large British base built in our Malvinas (Falklands) Islands? The Milei government will, of course, happily oblige with any US demands. In an interview yesterday, Milei described Bessent’s visit as “historic” for Argentina, adding that his government is in “perfect synch” with Trump’s. Put simply, the Milei government will bend over backwards to give away Argentina’s riches. This was on full display in a speech given by Damián Reidel, the head of Milei’s Council of Advisors, at the Latam Forum in March. Speaking to captains of the US oil industry, tech company CEOs, billionaire investors and public officials, Reidel explained how the natural resources of southern Argentina would soon be theirs for the taking (emphasis my own): “We have large tracts of land with access to energy and water, cold climates, which is the icing on the cake for cooling AI systems; and in addition, we are in an area without armed conflicts, without tsunamis, or earthquakes. There aren’t many places on Earth with those qualities. Obviously, the problem is that these areas are populated by Argentines. So this is one of the things that we’ve fixed. We are stabilizing the macro, we are giving them the legal framework to explain to them that we are open for business this time.” Meanwhile, for Washington the IMF continues to serve as a handy tool for pursuing its geopolitical goals, not only in its own “backyard” but far beyond it. As more and more of the Global South’s stagnating and heavily indebted countries succumb to the whipsawing effects of Trump’s global trade war and enter into default, the use of that tool could be about to increase significantly. The question is: how will China respond? Beijing’s refusal to let a BlackRock-led consortium buy out a Hong Kong-based holding’s ownership of two ports on the Panama Canal has shown that it is willing to assert its power as Washington attempts to roll back its influence on the American continent. China is still an important contributor to the IMF’s coffers even as it has expanded its own loan agreements with Global South countries. But will that collaboration continue if Washington intensifies its weaponisation of the Fund against Beijing’s alliances with the Global South? There is one other participant in this unfolding drama that is getting much less attention: the Argentine people. As Boron notes, it would be a serious mistake to think that the current popular mood of relative passivity will last indefinitely: It is a fact that social mobilization has grown in recent months and that, as all the polls show, frustration is spreading even among those who voted for Milei (NC: the Mileis’ LIBRA crypto scam, targeted primarily at Milei’s most fervent supporters, was almost certainly a turning point in this regard)… A careful reading of this country’s past teaches us that the popular mood can change in the blink of an eye in the face of events that, in another historical context, would be unimportant. Thanks for this post, Nick. I can see that Milei is going to run Argentina into the ground and there does not seem to be a group in that country of stopping it. He’s like an even tackier version of Trump and corruption follows him wherever he goes. If the US forces Argentina to abandon links with China, what then? Will this be seen as an opportunity for the Trump regime to isolate that country and then to have a fire sale of assets in that country for Trump’s Wall Street buddies. Unfortunately I could see this happening very easily. After all these years of IMF involvement, I’m surprised there is anything left to sell. “and then to have a fire sale of assets in that country for Trump’s Wall Street buddies.” I wonder what assets Argentina has that can still be privatized? That seems to be the IMF’s ultimate goal. “BUENOS AIRES, Jan 8 (Reuters) – Argentina’s government has privatized metallurgical firm IMPSA, the economy ministry said on Wednesday, marking its first privatization since libertarian President Javier Milei took power just over a year ago promising to shrink the state. The company’s shares will be transferred to the U.S.-based consortium Industrial Acquisition Fund (IAF), whose top partner is Arc Energy, according to an official announcement on Wednesday.”‘ https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/argentina-privatizes-state-metal-firm-milei-era-first-2025-01-08/ yes, thanks nick for covering this beat… always lots of meaty info Ultimately accumulating more unpayable odious debts is just not going to make much of a difference. I expect a lot of global South debtor countries just to renounce their debts and nationalize productive assets, once the de-dollarization proceeds forward properly. That would be the thing for the USA to do. Until then, the global South debtor countries are going to need some security guarantees to pull such a thing off. IMO. Thank you. I’ll second “meaty”. Sometimes I read articles here and I do not understand a lot of the content (my shortcoming, not yours). This is one such article. However, even in my confusion about economic terms like “currency swaps” and why they matter, one thing shines through: at no point in this story does a hero emerge that is fighting for the interests of the Argentinian people. Everyone has an agenda to serve the ultra wealthy, public welfare be damned. Thank you for your reporting. It seems to be a bit like South Africa. After you replace a dictatorship with corrupt kleptocracy and then with noisy liberals and fake radicals who pretend they’re going to change everything while actually making everything worse in exactly the way it was heading anyway, the population starts getting despondent and prefers to watch futbol. And then the far right gets its chance. Come to think of it, this is a bit like the US, except that you can’t really claim that Nixon was a dictator. Argentina is trapped in a “Groundhog Day” loop of serial looting by its comprador elites. Milei like Macri before him is just its latest iteration. And they both had the same finance minister.

Leading UK fintech, Marshmallow, today announces that it has raised $90 million worth of funding from Portage, BlackRock and Columbia Lake Partners. 0 15 April 2025 Be the first to comment This content is provided by an external author without editing by Finextra. It expresses the views and opinions of the author. The raise comes three years after the business’ Series B, in which time, it has almost doubled its valuation to just over $2 billion. The investment, a mixture of equity and debt, from funds managed by BlackRock and CLP, will be used to further grow the business’ product offering and support plans for international expansion. The successful fundraise follows a period of impressive and sustained growth. Focused on providing car and van insurance to those who have moved to the UK, Marshmallow has now insured over 1 million drivers and has a turnover run rate of over $500m, making it one of the largest fintechs in Europe. People who move to the UK continue to unfairly face higher prices compared to those born in the country. Marshmallow has been focused on providing better value to these customers and will continue to leverage its proprietary technology and rich customer data to do so. Following this fundraise, the business will expand its proposition to support newcomers across a wider range of unmet financial needs, becoming the one-stop financial services provider for people moving to the UK. Marshmallow will also seek to expand its proposition internationally, with the business planning to offer financial products to people who have relocated to other countries, extending beyond serving just those who have moved to the UK. Oliver Kent-Braham, Co-CEO and Co-Founder of Marshmallow, said: “Our ambition is to become a one-stop-financial-shop for newcomers so they feel as though it’s easy to move to, and live in, a different country. We’ve already supported over one million people in the UK with their insurance needs, but we’re only just scratching the surface. There are still major financial services barriers that make it harder for newcomers to settle and take part in everyday life. This funding gives us the capital to solve these problems and deliver against our mission.” Devon Kirk, General Partner & Co-Head, Portage Capital Solutions, commented: “Marshmallow is a clear leader in innovating to solve important financial challenges for consumers. We are confident in the business’ ability to continue developing solutions for a fairer financial ecosystem, and we are excited to support this strong team as it enters its next stage of growth.”

Now, with a million drivers insured and a profitable annual revenue run rate of $500 million, Marshmallow has raised a fresh $90 million to expand. Marshmallow plans to use the funding to move into financial services, as well as more insurance products that it hopes will appeal to a population of people that — despite the chilling effects of Brexit — is growing. “We think of migration as a huge opportunity,” CEO Oliver Kent-Braham said in an interview. He noted that in the U.K., there are more people coming out of the workforce than there are going in, with 1.2 million migrants recorded coming to the U.K. in 2024 alone. “We need migration to put more people into work, and we want to help people move and integrate into the U.K.” In Marshmallow’s view, that integration comes with being able to drive your own insured vehicle and soon, the startup hopes, buying home insurance and taking out loans. Marshmallow plans to launch its first lending product later this year, Kent-Braham said, en route to building a “one-stop shop” for everything financial and insurance that a new arrival to the U.K. might need to adjust to life. This round is roughly split 50-50 between equity and debt, according to Kent-Braham, and it is coming at a valuation of just over $2 billion. To put that into context, Marshmallow last raised funding at $1.25 billion in 2021. The startup has seen considerable growth on the business front in that time. In 2021, Marshmallow had insured just 100,000 people. Now, in cities like London, the one-million insured number is bolstered with a pink outdoor ad campaign that is hard to miss. Portage Capital is leading the round, with participation from BlackRock and Columbia Lake Partners. Previous backers of the company have included Passion Capital, Investec, and Scor. Marshmallow has raised around $220 million to date. Notably, the new round has been in the works since at least January, and Kent-Braham noted that one part of the equity was convertible debt raised in 2023. Marshmallow’s funding is coming at a complex moment for insurance startups in Europe. On one side, there is the grim story of WeFox. Backed by SoftBank, Omers, Salesforce, and dozens of others, WeFox’s valuation rose to as much $4.5 billion by 2023. Just two years later, after years of losses and complications in its distributed/broker-based business model, WeFox has fallen on hard times. The company has been selling off parts of its business and picking up lifeline financing to stay afloat. Yet there are also some brighter signs of insurtech startups building more sustainable businesses. And those that can demonstrate a strong technology story are getting attention from investors. Just last week, Ominimo — a new startup out of Poland — picked up a major strategic investor that invested $10 million at a valuation of over $200 million. It was Ominimo’s first time raising outside money after becoming profitable while bootstrapped. Like Marshmallow, the startup started off with car insurance and is rethinking actuarial formulas and using AI to make new inroads into risk prediction. While data science and AI are quickly becoming table stakes for insurance startups, there are other details about Marshmallow that set it apart from the pack — and even some of its bigger competitors (like the price-busting mega-retailer Tesco). The ideas of inclusivity and diversity that underpin how Marshmallow is approaching its target customer base run deep at the startup. Kent-Braham co-founded London-based Marshmallow with his identical twin, Alexander, and David Goaté. The twins really do look a lot alike. “You could actually be talking to Alexander right now!”, Oliver joked when we spoke for this story. More seriously, though, the startup is an underrepresented rarity in another way, too. It is one of what appears to be only two “unicorn” startups in the U.K. from a Black founder, the other being WorldRemit. The statistics are not hugely encouraging outside the U.K. either; one 2024 study found that across the U.K. and the U.S., only 3% of startups with valuations of over $1 billion have Black founders. At a time when diversity, equity, and inclusion programs are being dismantled in the U.S., it’s notable that Marshmallow’s investors see particular strength precisely because of its diverse leadership. “This is a very strong founding team,” Devon Kirk, GP and co-head of Portage Capital Solutions, said in an interview. “We think that financial services benefits from different perspectives and leaders coming up with innovative solutions to address those needs.” Topics Europe Editor Ingrid is a writer and editor for TechCrunch, joining February 2012, based out of London.

Title: Applied Materials becomes largest shareholder of advanced packaging firm BESI

Business FILE PHOTO: A smartphone with a displayed Applied Materials logo is placed on a computer motherboard in this illustration taken March 6, 2023. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo Applied Materials has bought a 9 per cent stake in BE Semiconductor industries (BESI), the U.S.-based computer chip equipment supplier said on Monday. The transaction makes it the largest shareholder of the Dutch company making advanced semiconductors packaging tools, above Blackrock Institutional Trust, according to LSEG data. BESI's shares rose 9 per cent in early trade and could see their largest one-day rise in more than a year if the gains hold. It produces the world's most accurate hybrid bonding tool, a critical chip technology allowing two chips to be bonded directly on top of each other. "I think that this is an astute move by (Applied Materials) to foster closer collaboration between the two companies," Timm Schulze-Melander, analyst at Redburn Atlantic, said in an email. The purchase makes it clear Applied is not developing an alternative to BESI's hybrid bonding tech, he added. Unlike most semiconductor packaging steps, hybrid bonding occurs much closer to the chip's production line and work together with Applied Materials' tools. "I think shareholders will be extremely excited and will assume that Applied will eventually want to buy the entire company," Michael Roeg from Degroof Petercam said in an emailed comment. The world's second largest computer chip equipment maker said it did not intend to seek board representation at BESI. BESI said last November it remained committed to its independence, amid rumours involving a strategic deal with the company. Hybrid bonding is used on the world's most advanced chips, like AMD's X3D line, where the memory chip is bonded onto the processor at TSMC.

Title: Approved retirement funds: What is an ARF and how much will it cost me?
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/your-money/2025/04/15/approved-retirement-funds-what-is-an-arf-and-how-much-will-it-cost-me/
Time Published: 2025-04-15T04:00:00Z
Full Content:
It’s the pension drawdown product that more and more of us are opting for and, yet, getting a fix on how much this product is going to cost us can confuse. While shopping around can help with cutting costs when it comes to an approved retirement fund (ARF), you need to understand just what you have to pay for and how different options work, before you can make the best decision for you. An ARF is a Revenue-approved financial vehicle that allows you to keep your pension fund invested after you retire. This means that the capital can continue to grow (hopefully) – although there is a mandatory withdrawal each year of at least 4 per cent, rising to 5 per cent once you reach the age of 71. Mandatory at least in the sense that Revenue will assess you for income tax on the basis that you are withdrawing that amount so you might as well. One advantage of an ARF is that you can pass it on, tax free, in the event of your death to your spouse. “Most people now won’t have defined benefit pensions, it’s mostly defined contribution, so when it comes to drawdown, many people will be taking a lump sum and putting the balance into an ARF,” says John Tuohy, chief executive of Acuvest. “So, understanding and managing them are important for people.” The alternative for those retiring is an annuity, which provides for a guaranteed income for life. This has been less popular in recent years due to lower interest rates, which means your pension pot delivers a lower annual income. [ Annuities or ARFs: what’s the correct decision?Opens in new window ] These days, annuity rates have fallen back again to around 4.5 per cent (which means it pays out an annual income of €4,500 on every €100,000), so an ARF will be the choice for many. But how much is this investment product going to cost you? If you have been a member of an occupational pension, you probably haven’t had to worry too much about such things. But once you retire, you are going out on your own via an ARF. That will inevitably mean higher costs – and the higher the costs, the lower the return to you. After all, this fund will have to last your lifetime and, while investment performance may be uncertain, fees and charges are a definite. [ Half a million euro for a ‘moderate’ retirement? The lump sums you need to saveOpens in new window ] When you retire, the company managing your occupational pension provider will likely offer you an ARF. But this doesn’t mean you have to jump into it. Better to consider all your options before making such a big decision. “People shouldn’t shop for product until they decide what their investment strategy is,” says Tuohy. “What’s my strategy? Am I doing it myself? Am I getting advice? Have I got a plan?” So what do you need to know? “With an ARF, consumers need to understand there are three elements to it,” says Tuohy. First up is the qualified fund manager or product provider, which is typically a life insurance company – Aviva, New Ireland, Irish Life, Standard Life, Zurich Life or Royal London – or a company regulated under the EU’s MiFID directive. This is the ARF platform, and takes on the custody, payroll, tax-deduction functions etc of the ARF. The next element is the fund manager with whom your retirement savings will be invested, and this includes the likes of Vanguard, Blackrock etc. Finally, you have a financial broker or adviser, who advises and arranges on the set-up of an ARF, “and I’d like to think advisers provide ongoing advice in helping to manage the ARF”, adds Tuohy. All three of these have costs. But how much? When it comes to the ARF platform, you can expect to pay around 0.4 per cent of the fund every year for this service. Next up is your investment. As Tuohy notes, “most people in ARFs will invest in funds, cash or passive equity or bond funds”. These will typically cost from upwards of about 0.2 per cent a year in management charges – but it will depend on the complexity of such products. “If you pick more expensive funds, you should expect to pay more,” says Tuohy. On top of this there will be ongoing fund costs, which may be of the order of about 0.06 per cent. Then you have the financial adviser charges. Your adviser may charge a flat fee for setting up an ARF – figures of about €7,000 have been quoted – or they may earn commission from the fund manager. This can reduce your allocation to the ARF so watch out for this. “There should always be a minimum 100 per cent allocation,” says, Ken O’Gorman, a director of One Quote Financial Brokers, adding that a recent client was offered an ARF with a 99 per cent rate. If you do opt to pay a flat fee for set-up, remember that your adviser may also be earning commission on this transaction, so make sure this is added as a bonus allocation to your fund. There may also be a clawback if you move your ARF within a specified period. Your financial adviser will also charge an annual fee, of about 0.5 per cent – although this can be less or more – for offering an ongoing advice service. [ Choosing a financial adviser: The last thing you want to do is risk losing your savingsOpens in new window ] “In my view, many brokers may overcharge,” says, O’Gorman, who adds that charges should be dependent on the level of service on offer. “You need to get what you’re being charged for,” he says, adding: “Unfortunately you will find brokers selling products. They think that’s the solution”. O’Gorman charges between 0.2 per cent and 0.25 per cent a year for ongoing advice, depending on the size of the ARF. “It’s about constructing ARFs in a more nuanced way to protect the client,” he says, adding that buying an ARF should not be “a rush job”, and that a typical approach will see him construct a portfolio that blends different managers. All in then, your ARF can cost between 1 per cent and 1.5 per cent or so a year. This is not insignificant; if your ARF is worth €100,000, it will cost you between €1,000 and €1,500 a year, increasing to between €5,000 and €7,500 for an ARF valued at €500,000. “Everything is negotiable, especially if the ARF is particularly large,” advises O’Gorman. The larger your ARF, the lower you can expect your potential charges to be – at least as a percentage, if not in value terms. For example, with Cantor Fitzgerald, you’ll pay 1.25 per cent a year on a portfolio that is smaller than €100,000 on an execution only basis, rising to 1.5 per cent for an advisory option. Portfolios in excess of €1 million have a fee of 0.5 per cent execution only, or 0.75 per cent with advice. Transactional charges may also reply. Once you understand the different elements of an ARF, you can then consider your options. If you just want a standard ARF, and are happy to take this out without ongoing financial advice, you could look for an execution-only standard product. [ Women, take control to ensure you have enough income in retirementOpens in new window ] Broker Gerard Sheehy of execution-only.ie, for example, offers low cost options with providers including Standard Life, Royal London and Zurich Life. With Standard Life for example, you’ll pay annual charges of 0.65 per cent, which includes broker commission. Additional charges apply related to the specific funds you choose, but there are low-cost options here too – if you pick the Vanguard Global Stock Index tracking fund, for example, that 0.65 per cent would increase to 0.67 per cent. Going through an adviser to buy your ARF from a life company – and getting the associated financial advice – will push the cost north of about 1 per cent. Such products offer a lot of choice “but you’re going to have to accept limitations” says Tuohy, in terms of investment opportunities and choices. If you want “a much fuller window on to the market”, you’ll be looking at a more sophisticated option, such as that offered through Conexim, a subsidiary of Irish Life. You can only get access to this through an adviser (so remember to add in the cost of this too), but for a fee of about 0.4 per cent, you’ll be able to access a much wider range of investment choices (it has more than 9,000 funds on its platform). And fees on these funds may be lower than those offered through the standard life company option. If neither of these options (ie a standard ARF with advice, or execution only) suits you, you can also consider managing your ARF yourself. A self-directed option allows you to access a much wider range of investment options, such as structured products, property, private equity and gold, as well as traditional equity funds. And it gives you greater control over your investment decisions. But should you opt for self-directed, you may find you have to pay more. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Reflections from Columbia’s Forum on Climate-Related Fiduciary Duty
URL: https://blogs.law.columbia.edu/climatechange/2025/04/14/reflections-from-columbias-forum-on-climate-related-fiduciary-duty/

As the physical and economic harms of climate change accumulate, corporate managers have faced increasing pressure to reduce their companies’ greenhouse gas emissions and adapt their businesses to climate-related risks. In parallel, civil society organizations and activist investors have increasingly sought to compel private sector action on climate change, while the “anti-ESG” political movement has sought to prevent financial managers from considering climate risks entirely. These discussions have frequently centered on one key element of corporate governance: fiduciary duties. Broadly, fiduciary duties arise when one person entrusts another with discretion over their financial affairs. For decades, legal scholars have recognized that fiduciary duties under corporate law may force private companies to address climate change. Writing in 2002, Professor Perry Wallace argued that both the physical threats of climate change and the legal and economic impacts of society’s response to those threats will inevitably implicate “the heart of corporate governance.” In recent years, as the impacts of climate change and the energy transition have become more apparent, boards and courts have faced a challenging question: what fiduciary duties do corporate directors and officers owe around climate change? On February 21, 2025, the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law and the Millstein Center for Global Markets and Corporate Ownership, in partnership with the European Corporate Governance Institute, hosted a colloquium exploring that question. This blog offers reflections on the Colloquium and highlights areas for future research and action around climate-related fiduciary duties. The New Climate Fiduciaries Colloquium, held at Columbia Law School, brought together approximately three hundred participants who explored whether, and how, corporate directors and officers are obligated to respond to climate change. The Colloquium intentionally gathered a diverse set of panelists and participants, and was not intended to produce consensus about the scope or direction of climate-related fiduciary duties. See here for the Colloquium agenda; video recordings of the keynote addresses and panels are available on the Sabin Center’s YouTube channel and linked below. The Colloquium revealed several key dynamics that will shape the development of climate-related fiduciary duties. This section discusses three core takeaways from the Colloquium, which reflect the interpretation of the authors, and may not align with the opinions of every panelist or attendee. The Colloquium highlighted a core problem: a significant portion of corporate law commentary suffers from a lack of exposure to climate science and policy. Corporate scholars addressing climate change frequently understate or ignore the imminence and economic significance of climate change. While the Colloquium’s panelists and the attendees offered a sophisticated grasp of climate change, some influential corporate scholars like Professor Stephen Bainbridge frame climate change as an issue of social responsibility rather than an economic threat. Scholars like Bainbridge argue that climate change should trigger no fiduciary obligations because the duty of corporate directors and officers is to understand and oversee “the corporation’s business,” not to conform to “emerging social norms.” And while other recent scholarship finds that fiduciary duties extend to “mission-critical” risks to corporations, including “ESG” risks, this work assesses climate change as a reputational and liability concern for major emitters, and does not focus on the material supply chain and market disruptions that many corporations face due to climate change. And as several Colloquium panelists highlighted, courts are often ill-informed about the economic risk that companies face from the changing climate. Even academics with a sophisticated understanding of climate risks sometimes shorthand the terminology that distinguishes between corporate climate mitigation (the process of reducing greenhouse gas emissions), and corporate climate adaptation (the process of responding to the changing physical, legal, and economic landscape caused by climate change). This imprecision can undercut promising lines of debate. For example, during panel discussions focused on climate mitigation, the debate revolved around whether fiduciary law implied any broad duty to for fiduciaries to monitor the impact of corporate activities on the wider world. However, several panelists also raised when, and whether, corporate fiduciaries could owe a duty to preserve the long-term value of firm or portfolio investments through climate adaptation, even if that adaptation is not immediately rewarded by the capital markets. Because the distinction between mitigation and adaptation was rarely clarified, several attempts to discuss fiduciary duties related to long-term corporate climate adaptation fell flat. This ambiguity in conversations among highly informed experts is likely mirrored and magnified in boardroom discussions. “Fiduciary duty” describes a category of legal obligation, but fiduciary duties arise in different, and legally distinct, contexts. Board members owe their corporations different obligations than asset managers owe their clients, for example. The different silos of fiduciary duty law are easily confused in judicial decisions and broader commentary. For example, in the weeks leading up to the Colloquium, a Texas District Court ruled in Spence v. American Airlines, that American Airlines, Inc. had breached its fiduciary duty to its pension beneficiaries under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) by allowing its investment manager, BlackRock, to consider certain ESG issues. While this decision has not been affirmed by any higher court, and is one among many “anti-ESG” cases that have been heavily criticized by corporate and antitrust scholars, several panelists and participants in the Colloquium noted that it has already impacted their discussions with corporate directors and officers. This should be somewhat surprising, as the fiduciary duties owed by pension fund managers under the federal statute ERISA are similar to, but distinct from, the similarly-named duties owed by corporate directors and officers that arise from state statutes and common law. Setting aside the merits of the decision, there is no reason to think that the ERISA-focused ruling in Spence should directly affect the decisions of judges assessing fiduciary duties that arise under other legal schemes. But the distinctions are muddled, boards and officers may respond by being overly cautious, or by adhering to the wrong set of obligations. Discussions at the Colloquium highlighted that there is important legal analysis to be done clarifying the different sources of obligations for fiduciaries. Debates at the Colloquium also suggest that corporate climate action will continue to be shaped by litigation. Panelists discussed emerging litigation theories that seek to force corporations to respond to climate change, or to protect the discretion of directors and officers to independently assess climate risks. There was also concern about the potential for anti-climate litigation to preclude corporations from acting on climate risks. Experts debated whether competing standards would create a “Brussels effect” around climate corporate fiduciary duties, if multi-jurisdictional companies are pressured into a “race to the top” to operate in jurisdictions with high regulatory standards. In response to rising international standards and the increasing legal salience of climate change, plaintiffs may seek to bring fiduciary duty claims against directors and officers who fail to oversee corporate compliance with climate change laws in other jurisdictions. Corporations also face legal action from anti-ESG politicians and fossil fuel interests seeking to prevent corporate compliance with climate change-related laws in other jurisdictions. For example, Texas House Bill 4049, introduced on April 9, 2025, purports to ban companies doing business in Texas from complying with greenhouse gas reporting laws in other jurisdictions. This bill has not passed, and its legality and practical impact are highly suspect. But it reflects a troubling trend opposing corporate responses to climate change. Some panelists observed that this anti-environmental activism may, somewhat ironically, prompt fiduciary litigation from climate advocates defending corporations, in an effort to establish that fiduciary duty law gives directors and officers the right to consider climate risks, even if it does not necessarily mandate that they do so. The 2025 Colloquium on Climate-Related Fiduciary Duties suggests several new avenues to advance private sector responses to climate change. As discussed above, corporate law scholars and climate change experts sometimes lack a shared expertise and terminology. A body of neutral, educational research and “primer” resources would be valuable to reduce confusion about the legal status of climate-related fiduciary duties. This material could educate researchers, practitioners, commentators, and the public about the different silos of fiduciary duty law, with analysis of the climate-related rules and caselaw applicable to each. This would both inform the public discourse around climate-related fiduciary duties, and, importantly, help corporate decision-makers and their counsel to understand the range of permitted corporate climate action. Interdisciplinary scholarship is also vital to address areas where climate-related fiduciary duties intersect with other bodies of law. Participants in the Colloquium are already conducting groundbreaking research at the intersection of fiduciary duty and transactional law, religious freedom, and antitrust, among other areas. Greater resources are necessary to support these efforts and generate scholarship that responds to the pressures and exigencies of climate change across all sectors and practice areas. The Colloquium also highlighted key areas where researchers can respond to legal developments that are undermining climate action. It is clear that courts, commentators, and corporate legal decisionmakers often use flawed assumptions about the physical, economic, and societal impacts of climate change. Elsewhere, judicial decisions around fiduciary duty are often laden with assumptions drawn from Law and Economics literature that do not necessarily reflect the reality of markets or the full impact of climate change. For example, consider when courts are asked to use the present value of shares as a metric of corporate harm: this seemingly neutral approach depends on a version of the efficient markets hypothesis, which presumes that markets incorporate important information into the price of stocks. However, many studies suggest that climate change-related risk is imperfectly priced by capital markets. There is a significant need for research and scholarship that identifies the underlying assumptions of corporate law, and assesses where such assumptions may fail under the physical, economic, and societal pressures of climate change. Through its the Initiative on Climate Risk and Resilience Law (ICRRL), the Climate Law & Finance Initiative (CLFI), the Sabin Center is committed advancing this research and building on the complex discussions raised during Colloquium. As ever, the Center welcomes scholars and practitioners to contribute their expertise and efforts to advance a whole-society approach to the urgent challenges of climate change.

Title: Report: Crypto Firm Anchorage Digital Bank Investigated by Homeland Security

Crypto company Anchorage Digital Bank is reportedly being investigated by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The nature of the investigation is not known, but the DHS organization that is running it — the El Dorado Task Force — is dedicated to combating money laundering and other financial crimes, Barron’s reported Monday (April 14), citing unnamed sources. As part of its investigation, the task force has contacted former Anchorage Digital Bank employees and asked about the firm’s practices and policies, according to the report. Neither Anchorage Digital Bank nor the Department of Homeland Security immediately replied to PYMNTS’ request for comment. Anchorage Digital Bank offers asset safeguarding and trading services to financial institutions and governments, according to the Barron’s report. The bank was flagged by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) in April 2022 for failing to comply with anti-money laundering (AML) mandates and violating rules for monitoring suspicious activity. The OCC said at the time that Anchorage Digital Bank failed to adopt a compliance program that met Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and AML protocols after being granted a conditional charter in January 2021. “The OCC holds all nationally chartered banks to the same high standards, whether they engage in traditional or novel activities,” then-Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael Hsu said in an April 2022 press release. “When institutions fall short, we will take action and hold them accountable to ensure compliance with federal laws and regulations.” Anchorage Digital Bank, which didn’t admit or deny the OCC’s findings, agreed to correct the issues, the OCC said at the time. In a January 2023 press release, the Anchorage Digital Bank said it had strengthened its team and revamped its BSA/AML and compliance programs. “We’ve also taken specific steps to enhance technology capabilities to enable monitoring transactions in a programmatic, scalable way,” the release said. “With our new technology platform, these hires and our continuous investment in staff, we will ensure that our institutional platform continues to maintain the security-first approach that has differentiated us from the beginning.” On Tuesday (April 8), Anchorage Digital Bank said it deepened its relationship with BlackRock to provide digital custody, becoming an additional custodian eligible to support spot crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) and other BlackRock funds providing exposure to crypto.

Title: Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon Says Tariffs Could Spook International Clients

In recent days, Wall Street CEOs have offered various predictions about how the Trump administration’s tariff policy could impact their business abroad. Some have cautioned unavoidable fallout, while others claim their international dealings won’t be impacted. David Solomon, CEO of Goldman Sachs (GS), appears to fall somewhere in the middle. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. “What we’re hearing from clients, particularly clients in Europe and other places around the world, is they don’t like the level of uncertainty,” said Solomon during the investment bank’s first-quarter earnings call today (April 14). When it comes to how this sentiment will play out for a global financial institution like Goldman Sachs, “it’s early to call heads or tails,” noted the CEO. Markets have been reeling since April 2, when President Donald Trump unveiled the so-called “Liberation Day” tariffs—an across-the-board 10 percent levy, with additional “reciprocal” duties targeting countries based on their trade deficits. China, notably, has seen its tariffs raised to 145 percent, while most of the other reciprocal levies have been paused for 90 days. But tariff-induced anxieties remain. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase (JPM), warned last week that his bank “will be in the crosshairs” as international clients and countries begin to feel differently about American financial institutions. Morgan Stanley (MS) CEO Ted Pick had a more positive take last week, saying he remains “bullish” on his firm’s global business. Solomon, meanwhile, believes it’s too soon to tell. While the executive told analysts today that international clients are currently “extremely engaged” with the bank and there isn’t a decline of business on the horizon, Solomon noted that short-term concerns are particularly pronounced outside of the U.S. In some ways, recent market volatility has been beneficial to Goldman Sachs. Heightened levels of uncertainty have spurred a rise in trading, driving up the bank’s equity trading revenue to $4.19 billion in the first three months of this year—a 27 percent year-over-year increase. Total revenue climbed 6 percent to $15.06 billion for the quarter, and profit rose 15 percent to $4.74 billion. Both figures beat estimates. Goldman shares rose 2.3 percent on the results today. At the close of 2024, Solomon predicted a surge in mergers and acquisitions under a renewed Trump administration. So far, the reality has been the opposite. Goldman Sachs’ latest earnings reveal a clear slowdown in dealmaking, with investment banking fees dropping 8 percent year-over-year to $1.91 billion. The bank’s deal backlog has grown for the fourth consecutive quarter, Solomon noted, though he added that “our ability to execute on these transactions will, of course, be dependent on market conditions.” Solomon, like other Wall Street leaders, has become increasingly worried about said market conditions leading to a broader economic downturn. During today’s earnings call, he warned that slowing economic activity around the globe means that “the prospect of a recession has increased.” Dimon echoed similar concerns last week, putting the odds of a recession this year at 50/50. Other finance titans, like Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock (BLK), have declared that the U.S. might already be in one. For the time being, Solomon is urging calm. “My guess is, over time, this level of uncertainty will come down,” he said. “My general message to people is to go slow and take a pause here until we have more clarity around a lot of these issues.” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Title: MSC Founder Emerges as Key Player in $19B Global Ports Deal

Photo courtesy Port of Long Beach By Alessandra Migliaccio and Tara Patel Bloomberg) — Gianluigi Aponte, the secretive Italian billionaire who founded MSC Mediterranean Shipping Co SA, has emerged as a powerful broker in a $19 billion port deal with Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing. Aponte and his family-controlled Terminal Investment Ltd., known as TiL, are the main investors in a consortium that has proposed a $19 billion accord to buy 43 ports from Li’s CK Hutchison Holdings, people familiar with the matter have said. The grouping includes BlackRock Inc. and its Global Infrastructure Partners unit, which will control two of the ports in Panama. GIP also has a minority stake in TiL. The deal has thrust the 84-year-old Aponte into an uncharacteristically high-profile position while underscoring his firm’s increasingly dominant role in worldwide shipping. MSC has grown to control about a fifth of global shipping capacity, and Aponte has a net worth of $25.6 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The low-key Aponte, silver-haired and slight of build, rarely speaks in public or gives interviews. His closely held company doesn’t publish financial reports or strategy updates. Still, he’s a member of the exclusive club of ultra-wealthy European shipping magnates who earned huge windfalls during the pandemic, and who’ve been expanding their empires ever since. The group includes the Maersk-Uggla family behind Danish container line AP Moller-Maersk A/S, Klaus-Michael Kuehne, Germany’s richest man, who has a 30% stake in Hapag-Lloyd AG, and Rodolphe Saade and his family, who control CMA CGM SA. The Aponte family traces its seafaring roots back to 1675, according to its corporate website. Gianluigi Aponte was born near the Bay of Naples, where the family traditionally ferried goods and passengers. He trained as a ship’s captain and later operated ferries shuttling wealthy tourists to island resorts like Capri and Ischia. It was on one of those trips that he met his future wife, Rafaela Diamant, the daughter of a Swiss banker. Aponte started MSC in 1970 after purchasing an old German break-bulk ship, and the following year he bought a second vessel, naming it after his wife. He soon began buying secondhand container ships, some from scrapyards, as he looked to break into a business dominated by Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd. After carving out a niche on under-served routes, MSC eventually distinguished itself by emphasizing price over delivery speed. In the late 1980s Aponte made the jump into the leisure segment, and MSC Cruises became the world’s third-largest cruise brand. Like his European shipping peers, Aponte pushed heavily into ports and logistics. MSC’s pandemic-era profits fueled a further rapid expansion drive, and by 2022 it had achieved its founder’s goal of becoming the world’s biggest container carrier, dropping Maersk into second place. Aponte’s son Diego became MSC’s group president in 2014. Still, the senior Aponte remains highly active in MSC’s management as group chairman, with decision-making closely concentrated among the extended family, according to industry executives. Diego Aponte also heads the board of Geneva-based TiL where his father is a director, according to its website, which lists its shareholders as MSC, BlackRock’s GIP and Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC. © 2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: More than 60% of CEOs expect a recession in the next 6 months as tariff turmoil grows, survey says

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time A growing majority of America’s top executives now expects the U.S. economy to enter a recession in the near future, according to a survey released Monday. Of the more than 300 CEOs polled in April, 62% said they forecasted a recession or other economic downturn in the next six months, according to Chief Executive, an industry group that runs the survey. That’s up from 48% who said the same in March. Chief Executive’s data underscores the growing concern within corporate America around the future of the U.S. economy. Fears about a forthcoming recession hit a boiling point in the last two weeks, as President Donald Trump’s on-again-off-again tariff policy ratcheted up volatility in financial markets and stirred panic among some consumers. Indeed, around three-fourths of CEOs surveyed said tariffs would hurt their businesses in 2025. About two-thirds said they did not support Trump’s proposed levies, many of which are currently on pause. The monthly survey, which has run since 2002, includes several data points that paint a concerning picture of how America’s foremost business leaders view the economy. An index of CEOs’ views on current business conditions tumbled 9% in April, continuing its decline after plunging 20% in the prior month. The measure now sits at its lowest level since the early months of the pandemic in 2020. When forecasting business conditions a year out, CEOs held their view steady from March. Still, these readings were the lowest since late 2012 and have tanked around 29% from the end of 2024. The survey found that more than four out of five chief executives project costs spiking this year, which is no surprise given the ongoing negotiations over import taxes between the White House and foreign countries. Around half forecast their percentage increases in expenses to be in the double digits. In this vein, just 37% said they believe their companies’ profits will increase. That’s a steep drop from the 76% who gave this response in January. To be sure, Chief Executive’s data set included a few bright spots. Slightly over half of respondents said they foresee business conditions bettering over the next year, an increase from the 39% share seen a month earlier. Many CEOs may be getting some tariff relief as well. Trump late Friday announced that smartphones and PCs would be exempt from duties, though Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday that these exemptions would be temporary. Chief Executive’s data comes as U.S. business leaders have started flashing warning signs on the country’s economic future. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said Friday that he expects earnings estimates for S&P 500 firms to fall due to the uncertainty around Trump’s levies. Also on Friday, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink warned that the U.S. economy may have already weakened to the point of growth coming in negative. “I think we’re very close, if not in, a recession now,” Fink said on CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street.” © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Share this article The US Department of Homeland Security’s El Dorado Task Force has launched an investigation into Anchorage Digital Bank, the first and only chartered digital asset bank in the US, Barron’s reported Monday, citing sources with knowledge of the matter. The task force, which focuses on combating money laundering and other financial crimes, has contacted former Anchorage employees as part of its investigation. However, the details of the probe are currently unknown. Anchorage Digital is a recognized name in the digital asset space, having partnered with major institutions like Cantor Fitzgerald, previously headed by Howard Lutnick, who currently serves as commerce secretary under the Trump administration, and also with BlackRock. Last November, Cantor Fitzgerald established a partnership with Anchorage and Copper to act as collateral managers and custodians for its new global Bitcoin financing business. The collaboration aims to offer top-tier digital asset custody services, starting with $2 billion in initial financing. BlackRock has recently tapped the bank for its spot crypto ETF custody. The fund management giant offers two spot ETFs tied to Bitcoin and Ethereum, the IBIT and ETHA funds. As of March 31, BlackRock’s spot crypto ETFs had around $50 billion in assets under management, according to its Q1 earnings report. This isn’t the first time Anchorage Digital has encountered regulatory scrutiny. In 2022, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) took action against its banking arm for failing to meet BSA/AML obligations under its operating agreement.

Title: How the Business Community Turned Back Tariffs—for Now

Objections from business leaders played a key role in pushing the Trump Administration to reverse course on recently announced “reciprocal” tariffs, according to Yale SOM leadership expert Jeffrey Sonnenfeld and co-author Stephen Henriques. It’s a win for business, they write, but the business community remains concerned about uncertainty around economic policy. This commentary originally appeared in Time. The views expressed are the authors’ own.‌ It took a mere 13 hours for the Trump administration to cave on their reciprocal tariff scheme. President Donald Trump, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and Trade Advisor Peter Navarro did exactly what they said they would not do—“back off” of the non-negotiable trade measures. More perplexing is that no significant trade concession was gained from a single country during the brief period of “maximum leverage.” But a self-congratulatory tone was adopted after announcing a 90-day pause on the reciprocal tariffs.‌ While the President may have been able to confront retaliatory tariffs from foreign partners and diffuse public demonstrations against DOGE actions, he was ultimately unable to stand up to the growing chorus of CEOs condemning his administration’s tariff agenda. Under the threat of aggressor trade tactics, U.S. stocks shed more than $6.5 trillion in two days. And more market pain looked likely as corporate quarterly earnings were just beginning to be released, with growth forecasts being revised downwards. Moreover, Treasury yields and the dollar’s value appeared to be breaking with conventional trade norms during similar periods of crisis, fueling rumors of the two assets losing their coveted “safe-haven” status—and threatening the interest rate discounts on U.S. corporate debt associated with that status. Simply put, CEOs had enough. JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon admitted a recession is “a likely outcome” as tariffs were "beyond what people expected." Delta Airlines CEO Ed Bastian pulled the company’s financial forecast for the year “given broad economic uncertainty around global trade.” BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told an audience at the Economic Club of New York that most business leaders from his portfolio companies “say we are probably in a recession right now.” These three instances are but a few of the many recent statements of defiance from all corners of the business community, including finance, transportation, housing, autos, technology, and general manufacturing—led by other titans of industry, from Tesla’s Elon Musk to Ford’s Jim Farley to Alcoa’s Bill Oplinger as well as trade association leaders such as Jay Timmons of the National Association of Manufacturers and Suzanne Clark of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ‌ Last month, in fact, at Yale’s CEO Caucus, 100 top CEOs told us they would begin to speak out against Trump if the stock market fell by approximately 20%. Business executives did exactly that as the markets surpassed or flirted with the threshold. Collectively, they punctured the threats and self-inflicted suffering in a challenge directed towards the president. ‌ Despite the moderate trade relief, CEOs remain confused and concerned with the continued delays and whiplash reversals by the administration. The uncertainty has stalled business investment and stymied the potential boon in opportunities from deregulation. Many have expressed a loss of confidence in the president’s economic policy agenda. Trump has placed himself in a precarious situation.‌ In corporate leaders’ minds, the blame rests not only on Trump but also Navarro and Lutnick. Both have lost credibility after reversing course on the negotiability of tariffs. In an interview last week on CNN, Lutnick said, “I don't think there's any chance…President Trump's going to back off his tariffs.” On the same day, Navarro went on air to declare “this [tariff doctrine] is not a negotiation.” The trade advisor then doubled down in an op-ed with the Financial Times. It is Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent who adopted the opposite message to his two colleagues in the internal feud over the White House’s trade strategy. ‌ Wednesday’s market relief in response to Trump’s Truth Social post indicates the President may have quelled some of the jitters of nervous traders but not those of CEOs. Business leaders might have stopped him from driving the U.S. economy off a cliff, but it remains teetering on the edge. ‌ The conflicting details from White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, Bessent, and Trump did not provide business leaders enough confidence to end their pause on capital investments or M&A. After more firm details behind the pause emerged, initial excitement tempered. Some analysts even expect the new tariff policy to be just as economically painful. The 10% base tariff was not rescinded. Tariffs on China were ratcheted up to 145% from 104% as punishment for retaliation, despite the European Union approving retaliatory tariffs of their own hours before. The tariff stance on Canada and Mexico were not affected, nor were existing tariffs on the auto, steel, aluminum, lumber, and other sectors rescinded. Tariffs on the pharmaceutical and semiconductor industries are still reportedly under consideration. ‌ The heightened sense of uncertainty that forced small business confidence to plunge by 50%, labor market conditions to deteriorate, capital spending to stall, and GDP growth forecasts to plummet still remains. Before any reciprocal tariff announcements, 89% of CEOs said at our CEO Caucus in March that they were increasingly concerned the US economy is heading towards a recession, while 69% said the administration would be bad for the economy. Nearly all leaders supported the use of selective tariffs, like most of the American public, but not those that are generalized or reciprocal. And as four-fifths of CEOs reported apologizing for Trump’s behavior to their international counterparts, some of those same longtime foreign trade partners are having exploratory conversations with China to expand commercial ties. ‌ Perhaps Musk best described the current tariff policy on X amid his public feud with Navarro. Musk called Trump’s trade advisor “dumber than a sack of bricks." Seems appropriate, but then again, that characterization might be unfair to bricks. ‌ The trade policy uncertainty continues to present significant challenges for business leaders, disrupting long-term planning, investment decisions, and global supply chain strategies. The recent decision to pause reciprocal tariffs might be a small “win” for leaders. They are hoping the President has learned a lesson here.

Title: Taoiseach hails €1bn-plus ‘Cluas’ light rail project in Cork

Taoiseach Micheál Martin at the launch of the Luas Cork Emerging Preferred Route Public Consultation (Niall Carson/PA) The new €1bn-plus Cork light rail project will prove transformational for the city, the Taoiseach has promised. Micheál Martin was speaking as he launched the eight-week public consultation process on the emerging preferred route for the project, which has already been nicknamed 'Cluas' on Leeside. Luas Cork is a proposed 18km light-rail line with up to 25 stops running from Ballincollig through the city centre to Mahon Point. It will link key Cork destinations such as MTU, Cork University Hospital, UCC, Cork city centre, Kent Station, Cork Docklands, Blackrock and Mahon. The scheme includes a new public transport bridge connecting Kent Station to Kennedy Quay and new cycling infrastructure along much of the route. No overall cost has yet been specified for the scheme but it has been projected at €1bn to €2bn. The emerging preferred route also includes a proposed 1,000-vehicle park & ride facility in Ballincollig and a special mobility hub in Mahon. Taoiseach Micheál Martin at the launch of the Luas Cork Emerging Preferred Route Public Consultation (Niall Carson/PA) News in 90 Seconds - 14 April 2025 When fully operational, it will handle up to 2,300 passengers per hour with a forecast demand of 16 million passengers per annum. There will be no overhead cables in Cork city centre - and 65,000 Cork city residents will live within a 15-minute walk of a Luas stop. It will offer a 20-minute link between Mahon and Cork city centre and 35 minutes from the city centre to Ballincollig. A key element of the plan is a high-quality interchange at Cork's main railway hub, Kent Station. Mr Martin said light rail was vital to cater for the future transport needs of an expanding Cork. It will be the fastest-growing city in Ireland over the next 20 years with a population targeted to grow by 50pc to 60pc as the city strives to become a counterweight to Dublin and the east coast. The Taoiseach refused to specify a timeframe for completion of Luas Cork and said its rate of funding would be determined by future economic and fiscal issues. “Luas Cork will hugely improve connectivity in the city by modernising the city’s public transport network, making it more accessible and creating new opportunities for residents, visitors and local businesses," he said. "This is a very significant day for the public of Cork - this will be a transformative transport project for Cork city. "We are looking overall at a transport investment and network that will meet the needs of a growing city with a huge projected increase in population over the next 20 years. "It is very positive to see this project progressing and from that point of view I would like to acknowledge the work done by Transport Infrastructure Ireland, the National Transport Authority and indeed Cork City Council. “With the consultation process now open, I would encourage everybody to take this opportunity to provide their feedback and share their views on this exciting proposal.” Transport Minister Darragh O'Brien said such public transport investments were absolutely crucial for Ireland successfully preparing for future population growth. "The development of Luas Cork will play a key role in achieving this goal. By providing a modern, reliable, and efficient public transport option, Luas Cork will encourage a shift away from private car use, reducing traffic congestion, lowering carbon emissions, and improving air quality." "The project will also complement other sustainable transport initiatives, such as expanded bus services and enhanced cycling and pedestrian infrastructure.” Lord Mayor of Cork Councillor Dan Boyle said the city had been waiting a long time for such a critical investment as Luas Cork. "It is a long-awaited, missing but vital link in the city's transport infrastructure, it will provide real choice to have more people travel by public transport, reduce car dependency, connect key locations and allow for significant additional growth in the development of the city." "The challenge is to see it constructed and operating in the shortest possible time frame." Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news

Title: President Trump: The Tariff Czar. Tariffs Impact Whose Economies?

Time Published: 2025-04-14T13:52:28Z

President Trump called 2 April 2025 “Liberation Day” because this is the day when he announced new sweeping tariffs across the board, meaning, indeed, on all countries across the world. He might as well have called it “Day of Reckoning.” Did it signal the beginning of a global trade war? Or, is it just a game by which self-centered President Trump wants to show-off again, as being the one who commands the game, the one who can bend the world to its knees. Or so, he believes. But at what cost? And for whom to pay the cost? It is a dangerous game, more a gamble than a game. It is the gamble of a typical deal-maker – the extreme is “lose it all,” that is the direction this is going or win it all. “Win it all” for Trump, i.e. the US, is no option. There are too many smarter players around the globe. By now, at least 75 countries are begging Trump to “negotiate” bilateral tariff structures. It is not so much a question of cost for the partner countries, but for the US themselves. Washington has much more to lose than the rest of the world. Trump’s aim seems clear: 1) bring back outsourced manufacturing to the US; and 2) attract foreign new investments for manufacturing in the US, with significant tax breaks for new investors. The cost of either option is astronomical, and even if some countries / corporations are willing to take the risk of moving their manufacturing from a low-wage to a high-wage country – it doesn’t happen overnight. What happens in the meantime when new markets must be found? Who needs US goods? They hardly produce anything. Most everything you buy in the US is “made in China.” Even Trump’s red MAGA hat is “made in China.” American consumers will suffer the most. A couple of days ago, Trump increased tariffs for Chinese imports from 84% to 125%. He said, attempting to justify his move before the rest of the world, increased duties are intended to make China realize that “ripping off the USA and other countries is no longer sustainable or acceptable.” On his Truth Social platform, Trump wrote that this was “based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the world’s markets.” Interesting though, how come everybody buys Chinese goods, not just because they are cheaper than US and other western goods, but also because Chinese quality in many cases is way superior. Chinese production is not subject to the US and western traditional corruption. Just look at the hundreds of billions-worth of corruption scandals the European Union (EU) is involved in, especially the unelected President Ursula Von der Leyen, or shall we say Dr. Von der Leyen, as in June 2022, she received an honorary doctorate from the Israeli Ben-Gurion University. See video below and this. Ms. von der Leyen said to her doctorate award: “Our democracy flourishes if Jewish life in Europe flourishes, too. Throughout the centuries, the Jewish people have been ‘a light unto the nations’. And they shall be a light unto Europe for many centuries ahead. (…) Long live Europe! Am Israel Chai!” Amen. This made Ursula Von der Leyen a forever Zionist, forever protected by the Zionists ruling the world; like President Trump when in 2017 he converted to Judaism. She is now not only guarded against several lawsuits, because the EU grants her diplomatic immunity, indeed also protecting her buddies-in-crime; but now she is also protected by the ever-Chosen People, the Zionists of Israel and around the world. * Back to the tariff game that must go on. It is an utterly destructive game in the end for the US, but a game it is. And China plays along. Good for China, who does not need the US market as much as the US market needs China. China makes believe gambling in tandem with Trump. China just upped the ante. They increased their tariffs for US goods also to 125% – however saying, that is it. No higher. No matter what Trump does, we will not increase tariffs any further. In casino lingo that means, “Les jeux sont faits”. See this. Trump is – again – shooting from the hips. Or was and is it a plan? If it is a planned game, it could backfire miserably for the US. But Trump seems wanting to keep the game going, like a drunken gambler. In this game or gamble, the biggest players are China and to a lesser extent the EU. The EU is considering retaliation tariffs of 25%; while most individual EU countries talk about 20%. For now, tariffs are suspended for 90 days on both sides of the Atlantic, as negotiations are being “prepared”. The EU is divided. There are those who say enough is enough, let us open up to China and Asia in general. Eurasia is a natural partner and an already well-structured market. Forget the oppressive US of A. Others cannot believe that the US may drop the EU, and still want to adhere to this losing game by tallying up to Mr. Trump’s Washington. In the end, Europe has never been an independent force on her own – thousands of years of exploitation, back to the Roman Empire, and before, colonizing others, up to this very day. They will eventually fall by their own weight into the abyss created between the two fronts. Just in case, an EU retaliation would have similar effects on the European consumer – at a variation, depending on the importance of US imports for European consumers. This maybe the reason for EU’s semi-clandestine approach to China for increasing trade with China – of course, officially a “no-no”, according to the EU’s own copycat sanctioning of China, as dictated by the Trump Administration. For China, the game is already won. China for years has oriented its market towards Asia, the ASEAN countries, including the world’s largest free trade agreement, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), comprising of 15 Asia-Pacific nations. The agreement, under preparation for ten years, entered into force on 1 January 2022, encompasses about a third of the world’s population and a third of the world’s GDP. The value of RCEP trade is expected to reach the equivalent of about third of the world’s GDP by 2030. China also has the Belt and Road Infrastructure, Investment and Trade Initiative spanning the globe, independently of Trump’s tariff fiasco. In addition, China, a cofounder of BRICS, is strongly committed to BRICS-plus inter-trading, as well as with the Global South (GS) in general. The GS will soon outstrip economic parameters of the G7. In Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), the GS is already stronger than the G7. China has no market problem without the US. But the US are likely heading towards enormous internal socioeconomic problems, without Chinese goods or high duties on Chinese goods which make them unaffordable to the American consumer – especially middle and lower end consumers. Inflation and unemployment will be soaring. But the tariff game continues. It is a destructive game for the US, but a game it is. And China plays along. China does not really need the US market as much as the US market needs China. Everything in the US is “made in China.” You stop the “Made in China” by ridiculous tariffs and the US comes to a standstill – because of inflation, labor loss and an uprooting of the American society – they may not take it. Specially the middle-lower income levels are losing sizable amounts of their purchasing power as compared with their 2024 incomes. Some analysts are comparing Trump to the stubborn Roman emperors. He cannot succeed. Irrespective of whether Trump politically survives his brutal tariff offensive, a U-turn is imminent, if he wants to avoid major domestic upheavals. The Budget Lab, a research center at Yale University, had estimated the toll on the average household at about US$ 3,800 annually, as compared with the spending power of 2024. See this for what it means in terms of inflation or consumer loss in 2024 US incomes. At the same time, Trump announced a military budget of about a trillion US dollars. This is brilliant logic of an extravagant megalomaniac. Or is there something else behind it? Are the global tariffs and the war budget deviously linked? According to the Budget Lab study, accumulated 2025 US import tariffs were scheduled to grow higher than ever since 1909. The stock market cratering alone wiped out about US$ 5 trillion. Since the first announcement of the tariff shock, the stock market has been like a roller-coaster. Some of the more significant market losses may be recuperated as Trump will negotiate bilaterally; or more, in case he will have to make an inevitable U-turn. Whatever you may call it, it is at best: “Radical policy changes” and an “unpredictable disruption.” In the light of the just announced one trillion US-dollar war budget, the imminent question arising: Is this game supposed to hide the fact that Trump is unable, or never was really willing, to achieve peace, neither in Ukraine, nor in the Middle East, because the profit stakes are too high for the war industry, and – possessing Ukraine and her riches is just too tempting to let it go. BlackRock has already privatized about half the country without most Ukrainians, let alone the rest of the world – noticing. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Goldman Sachs (GS) opened the floodgates on first-quarter earnings Monday, reporting a 15% jump in profit to $4.74 billion, or $14.12 per share. Strong trading revenues fueled the beat, and shares climbed 1.7% at the open — despite being down about 14% year-to-date. CEO David Solomon struck a confident tone while acknowledging extreme uncertainty amid chaotic U.S. policy turns. “In times of great uncertainty, clients turn to Goldman Sachs for execution and insight,” he said, while noting that Q2 has brought “a markedly different operating environment.” Goldman’s performance is a reminder that Wall Street firms often find ways to thrive in turmoil. As a barometer of capital flows and investor sentiment, the bank’s earnings show that volatility, while unsettling, isn’t always unprofitable. The strong showing adds to solid reports from other financial giants last week, including BlackRock (BLK), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Morgan Stanley (MS). Still, clouds are forming: analysts at both Morgan Stanley and Citigroup (C) cut their year-end S&P 500 targets, warning of slowing earnings, geopolitical instability, and unpredictable U.S. policy. With heavyweight companies like Netflix (NFLX), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), and UnitedHealth (UNH) reporting in the days ahead, investors will be watching closely to see whether the bounce continues — or buckles under pressure.
