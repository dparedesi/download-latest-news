The round was led by Bain Capital’s crypto division and Distributed Global. The funds of numerous prominent crypto investors also participated, including Katie Haun’s Haun Ventures and Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital. Superstate builds infrastructure that moves traditional assets, like stocks and government securities, onto blockchain networks including Ethereum and Solana. In the last year, that trend has exploded from a curiosity on Wall Street to a near-standard practice. Industry titan BlackRock’s once-experimental BUIDL fund—a tokenized money market fund— debuted on Ethereum in 2024. It has since grown by several billion dollars and expanded to numerous other blockchains. Traditional finance mainstays have followed suit. Earlier this week, the New York Stock Exchange unveiled an on-chain platform it plans to soon use to facilitate the trading of tokenized stocks and ETFs. SuperState has been a go-to service for companies seeking to bring their assets on-chain—particularly those with crypto ties. It recently helped two Nasdaq-traded firms, Galaxy Digital and Solana Company, tokenize shares. Robert Leshner, Superstate’s CEO, recently told Decrypt he anticipates tokenized stocks will become particularly popular with retail investors once they realize they take those otherwise idle assets into crypto’s decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, and use them as collateral for all manner of loans. “You can take that money and buy a car or buy a house and leave the system entirely with it,” Leshner said at the time. “I think there’s going to be a lot of really happy investors.” Crypto-native companies have also jumped into tokenized stocks in recent months, seeking to compete with traditional finance firms over market share of the growing trend. Last month, Coinbase debuted a new product, Coinbase Tokenize, which will eventually allow customers to buy and sell on-chain stocks, and also enable institutions to tokenize assets themselves. A report out Wednesday from BlackRock emphasized that as crypto and traditional finance become increasingly intertwined, the financial opportunities within that intersection are becoming increasingly lucrative—and the race to capture that market, more competitive. “You have traditional securities and assets that are looking to be tokenized, and frankly, you have [digital] assets that [...] are making their way into the more traditional financial systems,” Jay Jacobs, the author of the BlackRock report, told Decrypt. “We believe in that convergence that does seem to be accelerating.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2026 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: Musk Makes Surprise Appearance At Davos — Here’s What He Said About Greenland And Venezuela

Time Published: 2026-01-22T16:21:39Z
Full Content:
ByMartina Di Licosa, Forbes Staff. Musk shared his hopes of dying on Mars, rehashed his futuristic vision for humanity, and joked about political tensions over U.S interest in Greenland and Venezuela during his speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos Thursday Morning, a surprise appearance that came after years of publicly disparaging the conference. “I’ve been asked a few times, do you want to die on Mars?” Musk shared during his conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, “And I’m like, yes, but just not on impact,” he added, garnering laughs from the crowd. Musk opened the talk by joking, “I heard about the formation of the peace summit, and I was like, ‘Is that P-I-E-C?’ … A little piece of Greenland, a little piece of Venezuela…all we want is a piece.” Fink focused on Musk’s space and AI-related ventures, leading Musk to reiterate his vision for building advanced humanoid robots, which he said “everyone on earth” is going to have When asked if he had any last words to share, Musk said, “I would encourage everyone to be optimistic and excited about the future.” Musk’s inclusion in the Davos speaker roster was a last-minute surprise that came a day after President Trump’s speech. “There’s so many myths around Elon Musk,” said Fink towards the end of the conversation, publicly defending him, “He’s a great friend…and I’m totally inspired by what he has done.” Shortly before, Fink told the crowd he wanted to “humanize” Musk, garnering loud laughs. 850 of the world’s top CEOs and 400 top political leaders, including close to 65 heads of state and six G7 leaders, are attending the World Economic Forum in Davos, according to the organization. Musk joins a long list of notable speakers which, in recent days, has included President Donald Trump, President Macron of France, and NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang. Musk has been critical of the World Economic Forum for years. In 2023, he responded to a video of the event’s opening ceremony posted to Twitter with “How is WEF/Davos even a thing?” adding, “Are they trying to be the boss of Earth!?” He went on to compare the summit to message board 4chan, which is known for being a platform for extremist points of view, joking, “There should be a game show: “4Chan or Davos, who said it?” The year prior, Musk publicly announced that he had declined an invitation to attend the conference, calling it “boring af.” One reason for his past distaste for the yearly summit could be its viewpoint on overpopulation, which the World Economic Forum’s official X account has called “a global challenge.” Musk, who has 14 children and is an advocate for boosting world population, responded to that post with, “Population collapse is an existential problem for humanity, not overpopulation!” This year, he has yet to post about Davos to his X profile.

Title: Elon Musk says at Davos that robots will one day outnumber people

Time Published: 2026-01-22T16:20:56Z

Watch CBS News Updated on: January 22, 2026 / 2:18 PM EST / CBS News Elon Musk, a long-time critic of the World Economic Forum's annual event in Davos, Switzerland, appeared at the gathering for the first time on Thursday, where he predicted that robots will eventually outnumber humans. Musk has previously dismissed the event, which this week is hosting multiple heads of state, business figures and others, including President Trump, President Emmanuel Macron of France and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. In 2023, Musk criticized Davos as "increasingly becoming an unelected world government that the people never asked for and don't want." Musk, who last year led the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, is the world's richest person, with a fortune valued at $677 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Asked about the goals of his companies, which include electric car maker Tesla and space exploration business SpaceX, Musk said that Tesla's mission now includes "sustainable abundance" through the development of robotics. Tesla is currently developing a humanoid robot, dubbed Optimus, as well as automated robotaxis. "With robotics and AI, this is really the path to abundance for all," Musk told BlackRock CEO and WEF co-chair Larry Fink in a one-on-one interview. "People often talk about solving global poverty — how do we give everyone a very high standard of living? The only way to do this is AI and robotics." Musk added that he envisions a day when robotics are "ubiquitous," which he said would unleash "an explosion in the global economy." "My prediction is there will be more robots than people," he said, adding that humanoid robots could help provide elder care in a world where there aren't enough young people to take care of older citizens. Asked by Fink how quickly robots might be more widely available, Musk said that Tesla's Optimus robots are currently performing "simple tasks in the factory." "By the end of this year, I think they will be doing more complex tasks, and probably by the end of next year, I think we'd be selling humanoid robots to the public," Musk added. "That's when we are confident it'll have very high reliability — you can basically ask it to do anything you like." The market for humanoid robotics is today valued at between $2 billion and $3 billion, according to Barclays analysts. But the investment bank expects the sector to expand to at least $40 billion by 2035, and perhaps by as much as $200 billion, as AI-powered robots enter labor-intensive sectors, such as manufacturing. Musk also talked up the future of autonomous driving. "I think self-driving cars is essentially a solved problem at this point. And Tesla has rolled out... robotaxis in a few cities and will be very widespread by the end of this year within the U.S.," he told Fink. "And then we hope to get supervised full self-driving approval in Europe, hopefully next month. And then, maybe a similar timing for China, hopefully."

Title: Ethereum Holds $3,000 as Whales Accumulate: Key Resistance and Support Levels to Watch
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-3000-as-whales-accumulate-key-resistance/
Time Published: 2026-01-22T16:00:35Z
Full Content:
Ethereum (ETH) has stabilized above the $3,000 mark after a sharp sell-off earlier this week, as large holders increased their exposure during the dip. The recovery follows a volatile period in which ETH briefly fell below key technical levels, triggering liquidations and renewed caution across the broader crypto market. On January 22, Ethereum was trading around $3,003, up roughly 1.3% over 24 hours. The rebound came after ETH dropped nearly 13% between January 19 and 21, touching the $2,900 area for the first time in four weeks. That decline coincided with heightened macro uncertainty, ETF outflows, and the liquidation of over $480 million in bullish leveraged positions. On-chain data shows that large Ethereum holders accumulated aggressively during the recent downturn. Whale balances increased by roughly 290,000 ETH over a two-day period, representing purchases worth close to $360 million at current prices. This behavior suggests that some long-term investors view the recent pullback as a buying opportunity. However, other indicators point to a more cautious stance among experienced traders. The smart money index remains below its signal line, a level that has historically been crossed ahead of stronger upside moves. In previous instances, such confirmations preceded double-digit gains, but no such signal has emerged so far. Derivatives data support this wait-and-see approach. ETH perpetual futures funding rates briefly turned negative, indicating reduced confidence among leveraged traders. Options markets have also shown increased demand for downside protection after repeated rejections near the $3,400 level over the past two months. From a technical perspective, Ethereum is trading within a symmetrical triangle on the daily chart. Momentum indicators show a bullish divergence, the relative strength index has formed higher lows while the price made lower lows between November and mid-January. This pattern suggests that selling pressure may be weakening, though confirmation is still lacking. The immediate level to watch on the upside is $3,050, a former support zone that ETH lost during the recent sell-off. A sustained daily close above this level would indicate short-term stabilization. Above that, the $3,146–$3,164 range represents a dense supply zone, where approximately 3.4 million ETH have been accumulated. This area is expected to act as a strong resistance.

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/22/2026 7:31:29 AM PST by Tench_Coxe I’m at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland where I saw Chrystia Freeland, the disgraced former MP and cabinet minister. Actually, I think she saw me first and tried to hide from my sight.So I decided to ask her some questions.Now, if I had been in Canada, she would have had me arrested. That’s what she did to our reporter, David Menzies. And of course, she had no compunction about seizing bank accounts from hundreds of her political enemies during the trucker protest. (snip)I also asked her about her accepting a job working for the Ukrainian government, while also working for the Canadian government. Isn’t that an obvious conflict of interest?Needless to say, she was absolutely vicious, saying that anyone who would dare question her must be working for Vladimir Putin. I’m serious, she said that!

I read she was working for the Ukraine government. I didn't realize she was still working for the Canadian government.I wonder what her Zeeper handle is.Notice how all the WEF acolytes 'came home' to Davos? Although no Jacinda Ardern sightings as far as I know.Side note: Larry Fink of Blackrock is acting leader with Klaus Schwab having left in disgrace. 1 posted on 01/22/2026 7:31:30 AM PST by Tench_Coxe [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: Tench_Coxe Unless I’m mistaken, you left the author field blank.

Thursday, 22 Jan 2026 FILE PHOTO: Elon Musk attends the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum in Washington, D.C., U.S., November 19, 2025. REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein/File Photo Jan 22 (Reuters) - Elon Musk ‌will attend the World Economic Forum in Davos for ‌the first time on Thursday, marking a striking reversal for ‌the billionaire who has publicly criticized the annual gathering of political and business elites. The world's richest person will join BlackRock CEO Larry Fink on a panel ‍scheduled for 1530 GMT, according to the ‍latest World Economic Forum program. Musk's ‌appearance at Davos comes as he continues to play a key ‍role ​in several global debates, including SpaceX's supply of satellite internet to conflict zones and public criticism over sexualized images ⁠generated by Grok, a chatbot developed by his ‌AI startup xAI. In the past few years, Musk has been one of the ⁠WEF's most ‍prominent critics, regularly criticizing the annual Davos gathering as elitist, unaccountable and disconnected from ordinary people. Musk has repeatedly mocked Davos on his social media ‍platform X, calling it "boring" and saying ‌the WEF is "an unelected world government that the people never asked for and don't want." The Tesla CEO's status as an ally of U.S. President Donald Trump has elevated his political clout, giving him an unusual degree of influence over policy discussions spanning technology, defense and global communications. Several of Musk's companies are of direct interest to governments, ‌including SpaceX, a major U.S. defense contractor whose Starlink network operates in conflict zones, and X, the social media platform he controls, where changes to ​moderation policies have drawn criticism over misinformation and hate speech.

Title: Bitcoin Price Not Following ‘Digital Gold’ Narrative Amid Greenland Tensions
URL: https://gizmodo.com/bitcoin-price-not-following-digital-gold-narrative-amid-greenland-tensions-2000712910
Time Published: 2026-01-22T14:30:42Z
Full Content:
Reading time 3 minutes While the original Bitcoin whitepaper mostly focused on the crypto network as a peer-to-peer digital cash system for decentralized payments, the narrative around the worldâs largest and most valuable crypto asset has evolved into more of a store of value rather than a medium of exchange over the past decade. This is where the âdigital goldâ nickname originated, as some believe that bitcoin can act as an apolitical base money for the digital age with a monetary policy that was âset in stoneâ when the network first launched all the way back in 2009. As Larry Fink, the CEO of financial titan BlackRock, explained just last month, âBitcoin is an asset of fear . . . The long-term fundamental reason you own [bitcoin] is because of debasement.â While some view this digital gold narrative as a pivot from Bitcoinâs original design, the reality is that the systemâs creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, was concerned with removing the trust required in central banks to not debase the currency in some of his earliest writings. This may all sound great in theory, but the reality is that bitcoin has routinely been unable to act like its analog sibling in times of global economic turmoil. For example, the bitcoin price suffered one of the worst crashes in its history when COVID-19 was officially declared a pandemic in early March 2020. Over the past week, bitcoin has also dropped roughly 10% amid increasing tensions between the United States and Europe over control of Greenland and the selloff in the Japanese bond market. Last October, there was also a massive crash in the greater crypto market, including $16 billion in liquidations on leveraged positions, amid increased trade tensions between the U.S. and China. Of course, many of the liquidated positions were in crypto assets that are much more speculative and less credible than bitcoin. Meanwhile, gold is up roughly 5% over the past week. In fact, gold massively outperformed bitcoin in 2025, despite the precious metal supposedly being the less speculative and volatile asset of the two. While bitcoin has seen increased institutional adoption from the likes of Ivy League university endowments, nation states, and the largest asset manager in the world, the reality is that central banks, most notably China, still prefer real gold over its digital alternative. That said, the functional utility of bitcoin as something like digital gold still exists, as was shown by the recent flight from crypto exchanges in Iran to the base Bitcoin network. In addition to the local populations, there has been extensive reporting on nation-states like Iran and Venezuela using crypto to avoid economic sanctions imposed by the United States. While much of this activity is being usurped by stablecoins, these dollar-pegged tokens can also be easily frozen by their centralized issuers. Of course, the current inability of bitcoin to act as a safe-haven asset does not mean it is destined to fail to achieve its long-term goals. After bitcoin crashed at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, it went on to enjoy a 4,000% price rise to the new all-time high of around $125,000 hit last year. The price has since settled back down in the $90,000 area, and itâs unclear if the usual four-year cycles from the past will continue. The fact that it still moves like a tech stock in times of increased economic tension is a sign that it is still early days for bitcoin, despite its market cap now being measured in the trillions of dollars. However, it will eventually need to start acting more like the digital gold it’s touted to be if it wants to stand the test of time and become the basis of a new, digital monetary standard for the 21st century.

Crypto is now said to account for roughly 20% of the familyâs $6.8 billion fortune. Given that Bitcoin was created to circumvent traditional finance, what are we even doing here? Situations that expose centralization in supposedly decentralized exchanges have become par for the course in crypto. She warned of "extreme price volatility in financial markets due to catastrophising or euphoria, and a collapse in confidence." Arizona, New Hampshire, and Texas have enacted laws aimed at creating their own reserves. Turns out people might like to circumvent centralized financial infrastructure in times of political upheaval. Â©2025 GIZMODO USA LLC. All rights reserved.

(Reporting by Akash Sriram and Chandni Shah in Bengaluru; Editing by Alex Richardson and Saumyadeb Chakrabarty) Il 22 gennaio (Reuters) - Elon Musk parteciperà al World Economic Forum di Davos per la prima volta giovedì, segnando una sorprendente inversione di tendenza per il miliardario che ha pubblicamente criticato il raduno annuale delle élite politiche e commerciali. La persona più ricca del mondo si unirà all’amministratore delegato di BlackRock Larry Fink in un panel previsto per le 1530 GMT, secondo l’ultimo programma del World Economic Forum. L’apparizione di Musk a Davos arriva mentre continua a giocare un ruolo chiave in diversi dibattiti globali, tra cui la fornitura di Internet via satellite da parte di SpaceX alle zone di conflitto e le critiche pubbliche sulle immagini sessualizzate generate da Grok, un chatbot sviluppato dalla sua startup di intelligenza artificiale xAI. Negli ultimi anni, Musk è stato uno dei critici più importanti del WEF, criticando regolarmente il raduno annuale di Davos come elitario, non responsabile e disconnesso dalla gente comune. Musk ha ripetutamente deriso Davos sulla sua piattaforma di social media X, definendolo “noioso” e affermando che il WEF è “un governo mondiale non eletto che il popolo non ha mai chiesto e non vuole”. Lo status di alleato del Presidente degli Stati Uniti Donald Trump dell’amministratore delegato di Tesla ha elevato il suo peso politico, dandogli un insolito grado di influenza sulle discussioni politiche che riguardano la tecnologia, la difesa e le comunicazioni globali. Diverse aziende di Musk sono di interesse diretto per i governi, tra cui SpaceX, un importante appaltatore della difesa statunitense la cui rete Starlink opera in zone di conflitto, e X, la piattaforma di social media da lui controllata, dove le modifiche alle politiche di moderazione hanno attirato critiche per la disinformazione e l’incitamento all’odio.

Title: 'This is the single largest infrastructure buildout in human history. Get involved': Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says AI and robotics offers 'once in a lifetime' opportunity

Jensen Huang says AI and robotics offer a big opportunity When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has asserted that humanity is seeing one of the biggest revolutions in human history from AI and robotics. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Huang ruled out fears of an AI bubble by stating artificial intelligence reaches all sectors – it's not just a term used in tech businesses. "The spot price of rentals is going up. Not just the latest generation, but two-generation-old GPUs," Huang argued in an interview with Blackrock CEO Larry Fink (via The Register), referring to the sheer reach of AI. Artificial intelligence has already been seen to require ongoing investment across data centers, but energy infrastructure is also under higher-than-ever pressure and demand for skilled professionals is equally as high. Also speaking at Davos, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella also ruled out an impending AI bubble, noting, "I think a telltale sign of if it's a bubble would be if all we’re talking about were the tech firms," he said, remarking AI's global and cross-industry reach. We're also seeing AI evolve into physical devices, with Huang stating that robotics provide a "once-in-a-generation" opportunity for European manufacturing. Huang also made positive remarks on AI's effects on the labor market – he believes that "tradecrafts" will be vital to the buildout of data centers and infrastructure. "This is the largest infrastructure buildout in human history and that's going to create a lot of jobs," he said. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Nadella's opinion differed, focusing instead on jobs affected by AI. He compared today's landscape to previous workforce trends, where prospective employees would have to prove competency across various office software like Word and Excel. AI upskilling is just the next phase of that. In short, it's clear that both leaders see AI and robotics drastically changing the way we see work, but quite how that translates into job creation or job losses is yet to be seen.

Title: Nvidia CEO expects AI to create more jobs for construction workers, electricians, plumbers, and many others

But human-AI collaboration will likely lift certain industries to new levels. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Artificial intelligence is expected to reshape the labor market by eliminating white-collar positions that do not require a lot of creativity or experience, but at the same time increase demand for blue-collar employees like construction workers, electricians, or plumbers, as AI infrastructure requires a massive built-out, according to Jensen Huang, chief executive of Nvidia. That build-out spans many industries, so while some roles will vanish, others will flourish, reports Bloomberg. "This is the largest infrastructure buildout in human history that is going to create a lot of jobs," Huang said in a conversation with Laurence D. Fink, the head of BlackRock, at the World Economic Forum 2026. "We are going to have plumbers, electricians, construction and steel workers, network technicians, and people who install and fit out the equipment. In the United States we are seeing quite a significant boom in [these areas]: salaries have gone up, nearly doubled. We are talking about six-figure salaries for people who are building uh chip factories or computer factories or AI factories. We have a great shortage in that." However, the benefits of AI-driven growth are unevenly distributed across the labor market. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei once warned that AI-enabled automation could trigger a 'white-collar bloodbath,' which could eliminate up to 50% of entry-level office jobs. He noted that Anthropic's Claude AI has become particularly great at coding tasks, which could displace junior software developers and even erode portions of more senior software engineering work. Still, even Amodei believes the long-term gains from AI will outweigh the damage. Nonetheless, he warns that large-scale unemployment or underemployment remains a serious risk over the next five years. By contrast, Huang argues that some professions that can greatly benefit from both AI and human touch will actually increase demand for certain specialists, which will lift certain industries to new heights. "Ten years ago, one of the first professions that everybody thought was going to get wiped out was radiology," Huang noted. "The reason for that was that the first thing AI [gpy] superhuman in capability was computer vision, and one of the largest applications of computer vision is studying scans by radiologists. Well, 10 years later, it is true that AI has now completely permeated and diffused into every aspect of radiology. It is true that radiologists use AI to study scans. […] However, […] the number of radiologists have gone up. Is that because a lack of trust of or is that because the human interaction with the results of AI is a better outcome? […] The fact that they are able to study scans now infinitely fast allows them to spend more time with patients diagnosing their disease, interacting with the patients, interacting with other clinicians. […] As a result of that, the number of patients that the hospital can see has gone up, [driving revenues of hospitals]." In short, while AI can be a disaster for certain industries and professions, its impact on the quality of life will likely be comparable to the impact of electricity, automobiles, computers, broadband Internet, and telecommunications, all of which created many more professions and employment opportunities than they eliminated. However, one should note that the impact of AI can be compared to the cumulative impact of the aforementioned technologies combined in a very short time, so making exact predictions here is hardly a good business.

Title: Al Gore Heckles Trump Admin's Howard Lutnick at World Economic Forum Event

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick was heckled by former Vice President Al Gore during a World Economic Forum event in Davos, Switzerland, on Tuesday, according to news coverage. Gore booed Lutnick while the Commerce secretary was giving a speech at an invite-only dinner event hosted by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, Mediaite reported on Wednesday. The report comes after Lutnick criticized Europe during his remarks, which prompted European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde to suddenly leave the dinner event, multiple outlets reported. “I sat and listened to his remarks,” Gore said Wednesday in a statement provided to Mediaite. “I didn’t interrupt him in any way. It’s no secret that I think this administration’s energy policy is insane.” “And at the end of his speech I reacted with how I felt, and so did several others,” Gore continued. The WEF and a representative for Gore each did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment. “During Secretary Lutnick’s three-minute speech, no one left hastily,” a Commerce Department representative told the DCNF in a statement on Wednesday. “Only one person booed, and it was Al Gore.” Moreover, Fox Business Network Senior Correspondent Charles Gasparino wrote in a Wednesday X post that he was told by a “reliable” anonymous source that “at the dinner Lagarde walked out BEFORE [Lutnick’s] speech and was tired like everyone is at Davos.” Lutnick claimed in an op-ed published by the Financial Times on Tuesday that the Trump administration was “not going to Davos to uphold the status quo,” but instead was going “to confront it head-on.” “For far too long, the fate of the global economy has been decided by an international establishment who took America’s economic power and gave it to the rest of the world,” Lutnick wrote. “Some of our past leaders believed the lies that offshoring was necessary, borders were not, and our national interest needed to submit to global lower cost of labour for the common good. That approach failed the US, crushed American workers and ripped apart most of the rest of the world as well. It destroyed industries, weakened supply chains and left working people in most western countries behind.” Gore suggested Wednesday that U.S. government policy should promote “regenerative agriculture” during a panel discussion at the WEF. Gore added that the U.S. needs “policies that [are] in recognition of the fact that governments around the world typically do subsidize farming, but don’t subsidize them in ways that incentivize them to go in the wrong direction, but incentivize them to go in the right direction.” Gore, the failed 2000 Democratic presidential nominee, is the cofounder and chairman of Generation Investment Management, and also the founder and chairman of The Climate Reality Project, a nonprofit organization which aims to combat the “climate crisis,” according to a biography on his website.

Title: Jensen Huang talks AI's insatiable appetite for GPUs at the World Economic Forum: 'spot price of GPU rentals is going up, not just the latest generation, but two generation old GPUs'

AI is all-consuming. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Jensen Huang has well and truly escaped gaming obscurity these days. The Nvidia CEO just took the stage at the World Economic Forum to talk about AI demand, bubbles, and the impact that artificial intelligence has on the job market now and into the future. Of course, being the man in charge of shipping billions of dollars of AI chips, he has a particularly positive take on the lot. Chatting to Larry Fink, CEO of Blackrock, who called Nvidia 'nuh-vidia' throughout the conversation, Huang had a few things to say about his booming business. "One good test on the AI bubble is to recognize that Nvidia now has now millions of Nvidia GPUs in the cloud. We're in every cloud. You know. We're used everywhere. "And if you try to rent an Nvidia GPU these days, it's so incredibly hard, and the spot price of GPU rentals is going up, not just the latest generation, but two generation old GPUs. The spot price of rentals are going up, and the reason for that is because the number of AI companies that are being created, the number of companies shifting their R&D budget." Nvidia's datacentre business, the topic of conversation here, has soared to many times its gaming revenue in recent years. It hit a record $51.2 billion through August to September last year. Gaming revenue during the same period was $4.3 billion. Though the demand for datacentre GPUs, such as upcoming Rubin chips, B100/200, and older chips like the H100/H200, do have a knock-on effect in gaming GPUs. Just look to the price of the RTX 5090—a more than capable card for smaller-scale AI deployment—which launched at $1,999 and is now selling for around $4,000+. Capacity for production is one factor in all of this, as when AI comes knocking for chips, be those GPUs or memory, there's only so much readily available at any one time. That's why we're seeing RAM prices skyrocket: AI demand outstrips supply and datacenter buildout is more valuable than availability for consumers. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. In Huang's words, the fervour to buy more AI chips is "the largest infrastructure build out in human history." "That's going to create a lot of jobs," he says, citing skilled labor requirements for building out massive datacenters and increasing energy output to meet their demands. The impact of AI on the job market was one of the main topics of discussion through the talk. Huang, in no uncertain terms, suggested that AI will create a labour shortage, rather than take jobs from humans. He suggests one way to understand his way of thinking is to look beyond the tasks required to do a job and instead determining the purpose of a job. "Now, the easiest way to think about whether what is the impact of AI on a particular job is to understand what is the purpose of the job and what is the task of the job," Huang says. "If you just put a camera on the two of us and just watched us, you would probably think the two of us are typists, because I spend all of my time typing and and so if AI could automate so much word prediction and help us type, then we would be out of jobs. But obviously that's not our purpose. And so the question is, what is the purpose of your job? In the case of radiologists and nurses, it's to care for people, and that purpose is enhanced and made more productive because the task has been automated." I do think there are instances where this is not the case. When AI is entirely replacing the purpose of someone's job—or intrinsically changing it or shifting it further away—such as generative AI and artists or musicians, or closer to home, when AI tools are used to summarise news stories. When the AI is not owned or run by those professions affected by its use, it's not as often beneficial. Jobs may be created in some sectors, but similarly, jobs may move from other sectors entirely as it permeates into the wider market. Though Huang aims to keep things positive about AI, as you would expect from a CEO in his position signing off with a request for people to "get involved". And if anything is clear from this talk, according to these two, it wouldn't appear there's signs of slowing for the rapid buildout of AI. If anything, they suggest the large-scale investment in AI is only just beginning. 1. Best overall: AMD Radeon RX 9070 2. Best value: AMD Radeon RX 9060 XT 16 GB 3. Best budget: Intel Arc B570 4.

Title: Is It Ethereum? BlackRock CEO Wants ‘One Blockchain’ For Tokenization
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-one-blockchain-blackrock-ceo/
Time Published: 2026-01-22T11:30:33Z
Full Content:
BlackRock CEO Larry Fink used the World Economic Forum stage to argue that tokenization needs to move from pilot programs to market plumbing and suggested that a shared blockchain standard could cut costs and even “reduce corruption,” a framing that immediately reignited the “which chain?” debate across crypto and specifically inside the Ethereum community. Fink didn’t name a network. But the combination of BlackRock’s onchain product footprint and its own research positioning makes Ethereum the most natural candidate for the “one common blockchain” he alluded to, even if he kept it implicit. Fink’s remarks, delivered in the language of infrastructure rather than crypto evangelism, leaned heavily on the operational case for digitized assets and interoperable settlement rails. “I think the movement towards tokenization, decimalization is necessary. It’s ironic that we see two emerging countries leading the world in the tokenization and digitization of their currency, that’s Brazil and India. I think we need to move very rapidly to doing that.” He then pushed the argument beyond payments and into capital markets: “We would be reducing fees, we would do more democratization by reducing more fees if we had all investments on a tokenized platform that can move from a tokenized money market fund to equities and bonds and back and forth.” The most provocative line was his call for standardization and the trade-off he implied comes with it. “[If] we have one common blockchain, we could reduce corruption. So I would argue that, yes, we have more dependencies on maybe one blockchain, which we could all talk about, but that being said, the activities are probably processed and more secure than ever before.” BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told the World Economic Forum he thinks the movement toward tokenization and digitization is necessary. We need to move very rapidly to doing that. With one common blockchain, we can reduce corruption. The “one common blockchain” Larry Fink referenced… https://t.co/sMMcg4oyN1 pic.twitter.com/VhRvuwCx00 — Ethereum Daily (@ETH_Daily) January 22, 2026 In the abstract, “one common blockchain” could be read as a generic appeal for shared rails. In practice, BlackRock’s public-market crypto lineup and its tokenization work have concentrated around Bitcoin and Ethereum. On the ETF side, BlackRock’s flagship US spot products track bitcoin and ether — iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) — with ETHA launching in 2024 and now sitting in the center of the firm’s public-facing Ethereum exposure. On the tokenization side, BlackRock’s first tokenized fund, the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), debuted on Ethereum via Securitize in March 2024, making Ethereum the original issuance network for what has become one of the market’s most closely watched institutional RWAs. While BUIDL has expanded across multiple networks over time, the key point for Fink’s “common blockchain” framing is that Ethereum has been BlackRock’s default starting point for public-chain issuance, a meaningful signal in a market where “standards” tend to follow whoever already has the deepest liquidity, the broadest integration surface, and the most conservative counterparties. The stronger tell came this week from BlackRock research rather than Davos soundbites. In its 2026 thematic outlook, BlackRock explicitly floats the idea of Ethereum as the infrastructure layer that collects the “toll” as tokenization scales. One slide asks: “Could Ethereum represent the ‘toll road’ to tokenization?” and adds that stablecoin adoption may be an early proxy for tokenization “in action,” with “blockchains like Ethereum” positioned to benefit. In the same section, BlackRock cites RWA data “as of 1/5/2026” and notes that “of tokenized assets 65%+ are on Ethereum,” underscoring the network’s lead in today’s tokenized-asset stack. At press time, ETH traded at $3,005. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email. Jake Simmons has been a Bitcoin enthusiast since 2016.

Title: BlackRock Powers Bitcoin Investment For US Insurance Company, Here’s How
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-powers-bitcoin-us/
Time Published: 2026-01-22T10:00:41Z
Full Content:
BlackRock is enhancing Bitcoin investment by creating new avenues for institutional capital to access the asset within the US financial system. Instead of relying on traditional crypto markets, the firm channels Bitcoin-linked returns through the insurance sector. Through its partnership with Delaware Life Insurance Company, this approach integrates BTC exposure into a fixed index annuity framework, allowing insurers and policyholders to benefit from Bitcoin-linked returns without direct ownership of the asset. BlackRock is enabling Bitcoin exposure for a US insurance company by translating the volatile asset into a structure that fits the strict risk requirements of insurance products. In a statement on Tuesday, Delaware Life confirmed it has added the BlackRock US Equity Balanced Risk 12% Index to its fixed index annuity portfolio, formalizing the integration. This index connects digital assets with traditional insurance frameworks in a controlled way, making Bitcoin participation feasible within a risk-managed product. Instead of holding BTC directly, the index combines US equity exposure through the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF with Bitcoin exposure delivered via the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT). IBIT, BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF launched in January 2024, has grown to nearly $76 billion in assets under management, establishing it as the primary institutional gateway for BTC exposure in the US. Risk management is central to the index’s design. A 12% volatility target dynamically adjusts allocations to limit downside risk rather than pursue aggressive upside. This feature is essential for fixed index annuities, which are structured around principal protection. As a result, policyholders are insulated from direct losses on their initial investment while still participating in index-linked returns influenced by both equity and BTC performance. BlackRock’s role extends beyond access, supplying the ETF infrastructure and volatility-controlled framework that allows Bitcoin exposure to function within an insurance balance sheet. For Delaware Life, a subsidiary of Group 1001 Insurance Holdings, the partnership marks the first instance of a US insurer embedding Bitcoin exposure within a fixed index annuity. With Group 1001 overseeing approximately $76.4 billion in assets, the move reflects a strategic product expansion by a major insurance platform rather than an experimental initiative. Company leadership has positioned the offering as a response to growing demand from financial professionals seeking modern portfolio tools that remain compatible with retirement product risk constraints. From BlackRock’s standpoint, the structure expands Bitcoin’s presence in long-term savings and insurance markets without altering the conservative expectations of those products. By framing BTC as a return component within a tightly governed risk framework, BlackRock enables institutional adoption that aligns with regulatory standards, insurer capital requirements, and retirement planning logic. In effect, Bitcoin exposure is being packaged in a form insurers already understand and can distribute, quietly extending its reach into one of the most risk-controlled areas of finance.

Title: Bitcoin analysts predict ‘prolonged consolidation’ for BTC price

Bitcoin’s onchain structure “remains fragile,” said Glassnode, warning of a prolonged consolidation period ahead for BTC price. Cointelegraph in your social feed Bitcoin (BTC) price could be in for another prolonged period of consolidation if key support levels are not reclaimed, a new analysis reveals. Key takeaways: Bitcoin is stuck between key cost-basis levels, predicting 2022-type consolidation unless key support levels are reclaimed. Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a net outflow of $708.7 million, their fifth-largest since launch, signaling institutional caution. In the Jan. 21 edition of its regular newsletter, The Week Onchain, onchain data provider Glassnode confirmed key areas of resistance “constraining upside follow-through and keeping rallies vulnerable to distribution.” The BTC/USD pair has been oscillating within a wide range defined by the True Market Mean at $81,100 and the short-term holder (STH) cost-basis at $98,400. Related: Bitcoin eyes $90K as Trump sees crypto bill signing ‘very soon’ According to Glassnode, the recent rejection near the STH cost basis at $98,400 “mirrors the market structure observed in Q1 2022, where repeated failures to reclaim recent buyers’ cost basis prolonged consolidation.” The chart above shows that Bitcoin price spent the period between February 2022 and July 2022 trapped between the STH cost basis and the True Market mean before entering an extended bear market, bottoming around $15,000 in November 2022. Glassnode’s Entity-Adjusted UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD), a metric that shows at which prices the current set of Bitcoin UTXOs were created, also revealed a wide and dense supply zone above $100,000 that has been gradually maturing into the long-term holder cohort. “This unresolved supply overhang remains a persistent source of sell pressure, likely to cap attempts above the $98.4K STH cost basis and the $100K level,” Glassnode wrote, adding The Bitcoin “Risk Index has climbed to 21, hovering just below the High Risk zone (25),” said private wealth manager Swissblock in a recent X post, adding: As Cointelegraph reported, Bitcoin must take out resistance at $98,000-$100,000 to revive the bull market cycle. On Wednesday, US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded outflows for a third consecutive day, totaling $708.7 million, according to data from CoinGlass. This marked their largest single-day exit in two months and the fifth-largest withdrawal from these investment products since their launch in January 2024, as shown in the chart below. BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, posted the biggest outflows of $356.6 million. Fidelity's FBTC followed with $287.7 million, alongside four other funds that saw outflows. Meanwhile, spot Ethereum ETFs recorded a combined net outflow of $286.9 million on Wednesday across five funds. The last three days saw a “historic $1.58B exit from Bitcoin ETFs. BlackRock and Fidelity are leading the charge in heavy institutional de-risking,” said analyst NekoZ in a reaction to the outflows. The selling pressure from spot BTC ETFs coincided with the rejection at $90,000 on Wednesday amid growing macroeconomic uncertainty, which increased the probability of rangebound price action or further downside if the support at $84,000 breaks.

Title: The world needs more plumbers and electricians

Unravelling the hype behind IT for creating useful CIO strategies. It may not have made the headlines when world leaders and CEOs met at the World Economic Forum at Davos, but the fireside chat between BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and Nvidia president Jensen Huang, should worry everyone who has felt the trauma of having to book a tradesperson. Trying to get a quote for some plumbing or electrical work at home is as easy as using a metal detect to find a cache of gold on the beach. While the residents of Eastbourne this week munched on the news that their beach had washed up a container load of chips of the eating variety, it’s the demand for silicon chips, and, in particular those power hungry AI chips, that’ll eat up demand for tradespeople. Rather than economies experiencing job losses arising from greater use of AI in the workforce, Huang described the AI boom as the “largest infrastructure buildout in human history”, which he claimed would create a lot of jobs. “It’s wonderful that the jobs are related to tradecraft,” he said. “Everybody should be able to make a great living. You don’t need to have a PhD in computer science to do so. Specifically Huang said the tech sector will need plumbers, electricians, network technicians, construction workers and steel workers, as well as the people who install and fit out the equipment. Mirroring the views presented by Microsoft’s Brad Smith in a March 2025 Fox Business article, Huang said there was a great shortage of such people. Where there’s the most demand, Huang said there will be a salary hike. “We’re talking about six-figure salaries for people who are building chip factories or computer factories or AI factories.” The latest AI hardware requires water cooling and more energy per rack than ever before. It needs a total rethink of how to power and cool datacentre facilities. In a recent Linkedin post, commercial real estate advisor Kris McGee, said datacentre are paying electricians $130 per hour, flying them on private jets to job sites and building “man camps” in rural Texas. London-based IT rollout specialist, Optrium recently estimated that electrical systems account for 40% to 45% of construction costs while cooling and heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems represent about 15% to 20% of total expenses. The efficiency of these systems are vital to operating high-powered datacentres, such as those running demanding AI training and inference workloads. And keeping the electrical and cooling systems optimal means hiring highly skilled electricans, HVAC engineers and plumbers for water cooled systems. As demand for these skills increases with the escalation in AI datacentre builds, salaries of tradepeople will inevitably rise. The bottom line is that this demand will mean hiring a talented plumber or electrician is going become harder and will cost more.

Elon Musk marked his last-minute Davos debut today with a critique of US solar tariffs and aggressive targets for Tesla, including humanoid robot sales next year, as well as flagging European approval for self-driving tech within weeks. After years of describing the World Economic Forum's annual meeting as elitist, unaccountable and disconnected from ordinary people, the world's richest man was interviewed by World Economic Forum interim co-chair Larry Fink. The BlackRock CEO expressed his admiration for Musk at the start of the wide-ranging discussion, which covered the future of robots and AI, the economic benefits of reusable rockets and Musk's childhood fascination with science fiction. Musk has become more prominent in recent years, driven by his proximity to US President Donald Trump and his stewardship of firms including Starlink-owner SpaceX, social media platform X and artificial intelligence startup, xAI. Breaking ranks with Trump on renewable energy, Musk said the US could produce enough solar power to meet all of its electricity needs, including booming demand from the proliferation of Big Tech's power-hungry data centres. "You could take a small corner of Utah, Nevada or New Mexico - a very small percentage of the area of the US - to generate all of the electricity that the US uses," he added. "Unfortunately, the tariff barriers for solar are extremely high and that makes the economics of deploying solar artificially high," Musk said. Trump has been openly critical of clean energy sources while encouraging oil majors to drill more for oil and gas. His freeze on approvals for major onshore wind and solar projects has left thousands of megawatts of capacity in limbo at a critical time for the US as it rushes to secure enough power to meet soaring AI-driven requirements. The interview did not touch on other major geopolitical and economic themes that have dominated the forum this week, including Trump's ambitions for Greenland and Russia's war in Ukraine, focusing instead on technology and robotics. The pair joked about aliens, life on Mars and the "Terminator" film series. "We need to be very careful with robotics. We don't want to find ourselves in a James Cameron movie. Love his movies, but we don't want to be in Terminator, obviously," said Musk, referring to the fictional AI system from the "Terminator" films that becomes self-aware and turns on humanity. Among the highest profile executives speaking at the Swiss mountain resort this week, Musk predicted robots will eventually outnumber humans, leading to a huge economic boom, and joked about traveling to Mars. "People ask me do I want to die on Mars, and I'm like: 'yes, but not on impact','" he said towards the end of the 30-minute session, drawing laughter from the audience. His appearance at Davos comes as governments and regulators from Europe to Asia crackdown on sexually explicit content generated by his xAI chatbot Grok on X, launching probes, imposing bans and demanding safeguards, in a growing global push to curb illegal material.

Davos, things just got exciting: Elon Musk will be in town. Musk wasn't expected to attend the World Economic Forum. But a day after President Donald Trump's speech, the Tesla and SpaceX chief has been added to the schedule. The world's richest man is now on the books for a session at 4:30 p.m. Swiss time on Thursday, with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. Flight data from ADS-B Exchange showed that Musk's private jet, a Gulfstream G650, took off from San Jose International Airport on Wednesday night local time and is traveling east. It's not yet clear whether Musk, who has been posting on X for the last several hours, is on the aircraft. Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider. He's had a rocky public relationship with the organizers of Davos. In 2023, he made a post that questioned the need for the WEF. "Are they trying to be the boss of Earth!?" he wrote at the time. Musk said in 2022 that he had declined an invitation to Davos, writing on social media that it was "boring AF." The WEF said at the time that he hadn't been invited since 2015. More recently, the billionaire has drawn attention for his public feud with Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary, after the latter said he wasn't interested in installing Starlink on his airline's fleet due to several drawbacks. The WEF has not said what's on Musk's speaking agenda for Thursday. A WEF spokesperson confirmed that Musk is attending the event, adding that the forum has "an outstanding tech delegation attending this year's meeting — companies and individuals who are shaping the future of their industries."

Title: The critical hour of United Europe and our own “turning away” from Trump’s Davos, PASOK’s pointless infighting, bank profits and National Insurance

Greetings. Europe—and in the broader sense the entire civilized Western world—is at this moment facing a major and unprecedented test. The outrageous demand by President Trump to conquer or “buy” a country such as Greenland, which in fact is under the “European umbrella” of an EU member state, Denmark, is not a matter for discussion or negotiation. It bears no resemblance to what happened in the dictatorship of Venezuela, nor to how the United States might influence the fall of a regime such as the mullahs of Iran. Consequently, this is the moment when Europeans—and of course we as well—must resist Trump in a united, methodical, and determined manner. Mitsotakis, partly because of timing and partly because of the common European stance, did not go to Davos and will fly straight to the Summit in Brussels for the major issue of Greenland. Athens’ forecast is that no one other than Orbán will sign Trump’s “peace pact,” Meloni included. One shot, three birds I should of course tell you that nevertheless in Athens they are studying very carefully Donald’s proposal for the so-called Peace Council, which is truly… astonishing. I am told that on Monday Gerapetritis will travel to New York and take part in the UN Security Council, which will assess the well-known Resolution 2803 that lays the foundations for the day after in Gaza. As a serious diplomatic source was telling me, Donald’s Council is essentially different from what is proposed in the UN Resolution, since the corresponding council envisaged there has a fixed term, whereas Donald’s is “open-ended” and may start with Gaza but deal with any other conflict field. Moreover, it is unclear where the funds requested as participation contributions will go, while it is foreseen that Trump would be president for life. “If this passes, it is a simultaneous ramming of the UN, NATO, and the European Union,” a serious diplomatic source told me, explaining the reluctance of Europeans—apart from Orbán—to capitulate to Trump’s idea. And I learn that Athens has already conveyed this message to Washington. The Ankara meeting is being finalized It is a matter of days before announcements regarding the Supreme Cooperation Council in Ankara, which will take place in the first half of February. I understand that the second week of February is more likely, specifically by February 13. Gerapetritis and Fidan have 4–5 dates and are examining them based on the schedules of Mitsotakis and Erdoğan, but Athens is sending the message that the SCC must take place. PASOK quarrels for nothing “A bad village, few houses,” says the proverb, and it seems to apply perfectly in the case of PASOK, where the top figures are at each other’s throats with leader Nikos, who is trying to tidy up the shop and is leaking various scenarios, such as the possibility of running in Athens A, where Geroulanos is elected. Geroulanos gathered about 2,000 people at his cake-cutting event at the Caravel, and when Androulakis appeared he was received with lukewarm applause. “All right, it’s not exactly his crowd,” a senior PASOK figure told me, acknowledging nonetheless that whenever the leader is outside his own mechanism he fails to excite. I also understand that there is some… difficulty in relations between Androulakis and Diamantopoulou. Anna feels stifled because the program “isn’t moving,” as the shop isn’t pulling, while Androulakis may now be “loading” her with any shortcomings for the poor reception of the programmatic positions in society. Thus the shop will limp along until the elections, where “we won’t get more than 11–12%,” as a PASOK MP was saying. A potluck congress Otherwise, various parties are holding congresses in the coming days. For example, the New Left, where things are generally rather sad, and also President Stefanos, who announced a congress for the Democracy Movement on February 7–8 at the Peace and Friendship Stadium (SEF). Let me tell you that Vice President Zakri is already opening a discussion about cooperation with Karystianou; I imagine it will also be raised at the congress. In any case, the congress is something of a potluck affair, and the president even asked SEF for a discount for the “Melina Mercouri” hall, while there was also coordination with Olympiacos BC, because the congress ends Sunday at noon and on Sunday at noon Olympiacos basketball plays Kolossos Rhodes. In any case, the party is not providing buses or hotels for cadres coming from the provinces, and generally a proposal has been made as to whether they can… be hosted by friends from Athens. Rain–schools–Aris Now, regarding yesterday’s severe bad weather and rainfall in Attica, which manifested mainly from 5 p.m. onwards, I would say the following. Initially, in the morning, because the phenomena were mild, we all thought that closing the schools was an excessive reaction by the Region. In the end, it wasn’t so, because from early afternoon the weather worsened and the rain that fell was probably one of the heaviest in the history of Attica, during which unfortunately an unlucky woman lost her life. It is estimated that daily the Region of Attica alone transports about 32,000 students with 1,900 routes of public schools, special education, etc. Closed schools “lighten” traffic in Attica by about 7,000 cars per day, studies say. Therefore, the… “scientists” who started criticism early on social media (Aris Spiliotopoulos, Antonaros, etc.) simply rushed. What does Aris with the mustache, who butchers everything and knows everything—from the weather to President Maria—tell you? February 4 for the VOAK We were saying a few days ago about the official start of the VOAK concession within the first half of February. Although there were thoughts to do it earlier, the date has now been definitively locked for February 4. The duration of the concession contract is 35 years, and GEK TERNA has undertaken the largest part of the VOAK, the Chania–Heraklion section. In view of further strengthening the company’s concessions portfolio, Piraeus Securities proceeded with a significant upgrade of its investment recommendation, raising the target price of the share to €40 from €31 previously, following Santander, which a few days ago raised the bar to €49. The share closed yesterday at €30.84. Meetings of A. Exarchou with Eric Trump and the Saudi Minister of Investment Highly active at the Davos Forum was the President and CEO of the AKTOR Group, Alexandros Exarchou, as he had a series of important meetings of business interest. Among others, he met with the Saudi Minister of Investment, Khalid A. Al-Falih, with whom potential opportunities for investments in the energy sector were discussed, and with the Executive Vice President of the Trump Organization, Eric Trump, with whom he discussed investment opportunities and the broader prospects of the Greek economy. Today, A. Exarchou is participating in a panel with the U.S. Ambassador K. Guilfoyle, the Minister of Energy of Romania, and Deputy Foreign Minister H. Theocharis. Yesterday, during a discussion with businessman, author, and Forbes columnist Rhett Power, the head of the AKTOR Group said that Europe must decide what it ultimately wants to be: a real federation with common interests, a common army, and central authority, or a loose union of states. It needs to decide, he said, on its role and identity, otherwise it risks being sidelined in global geopolitical and economic realignments. Europe, he stressed, over-regulates everything, resulting in everything becoming more expensive, creating a huge competitiveness problem for European businesses, and squeezing citizens’ disposable income. A Greek woman in the top ranks of PepsiCo The latest major changes in the executive pyramid of the multinational group PepsiCo have brought Athina Kanioura to the top of Latin America. The Greek manager took over as CEO of Latin America Foods—one of the company’s strongest and fastest-growing business segments—while at the same time retaining the strategic role she has held since 2020 as Chief Strategy & Transformation Officer for the entire Group. For those who don’t know her: before “landing” at PepsiCo, A. Kanioura had built a long and steadily rising career at Accenture, starting from the Greek subsidiary, continuing in London, and reaching the top of global leadership in Analytics & AI. She herself, via LinkedIn, spoke of a “legacy of success” she is inheriting from Paula Santilli, of a market that remains a growth engine, and of a culture of innovation and speed that—she says—she can leverage to “unlock new potential.” The recent changes in the multinational’s executive pyramid also “touched” the Greek subsidiary, PepsiCo Hellas, where the new head is Georgian Konstantin Merkviladze. National Insurance opens its cards Today we will have the unveiling of the new strategy of National Insurance. The group’s CEO, Dimitris Mazarakis, and the rest of the management will speak to journalists about the framework of the goals and strategic priorities of the insurer after its acquisition by Piraeus Bank. We say framework, because the Business Plan 2026–2030, which will set out the strategy for the next five years, will officially be presented next March. However, some things are already known, with the main one being the ambitious target of achieving €1.5 billion in premiums by 2030 and gradually regaining first place in all sectors except motor insurance. For 2026, this is characterized to some extent as a transition and preparation year for the full development of (co)operations with Piraeus Bank, as well as infrastructure issues such as accelerating digitization, technological support, etc. At the operational level, a major issue is repositioning in the Health sector and the further development of collaborations created due to Piraeus Bank, such as with Errikos Dynan, the utilization of the banking network, strengthening and expanding sales networks in Greece, and more. Naturally, there are many other issues the management will be called upon to address, some extremely difficult and not exclusively in its hands, with perhaps the foremost being how the issue of increases in premiums and healthcare costs will be handled, and what will happen in the future with the two partnerships that Piraeus Bank maintains with two well-known insurance companies. Banks rush to announce results (+dividend) It may not be a coincidence but rather a symptom of banks’ haste to announce their results and the dividend for fiscal year 2025 as early as possible. Piraeus Bank and Eurobank will announce their 2025 financial results on February 26, 2026, a date that exemplifies the trend that has formed in our market toward the earliest possible disclosure of financial data. Overall, the four systemic banks will present total net profits of approximately €4.7 billion for 2025, despite pressure from the reduction of ECB interest rates. Already from the nine-month period, profits had reached €3.5 billion, with an increase in the loan portfolio of €10.5 billion. Bank of America estimates that Eurobank closed the year with net profits of €1.36 billion, while for Piraeus the estimates amount to €890 million. Early announcement allows faster approval by the SSM for dividend distribution and potentially buyback programs. The two banks are planning high payout ratios (Eurobank 50%, Piraeus 35% gradually rising to 50%), with a total dividend yield exceeding 7–8% for 2026–2027. With strong capital adequacy, NPE ratios below 3%, and aggressive expansion plans through acquisitions that enrich revenue sources, banks are trying to justify the investment fever on the Stock Exchange. Free shares A program for the free allocation of shares to administrative and executive staff was approved by Ergon Foods, concerning the distribution of up to 11.69 million preferred non-voting shares, with a nominal value of €0.10, with an annual privilege between €3,000 and €5,000 per beneficiary, deriving from the capitalization of retained earnings. The program runs until 30/06/2026 and the Board of Directors will determine the beneficiaries, the terms of allocation, and the holding obligation. The timing is not accidental. It comes a few months after the entry of the Halcyon fund under Eleni Bathianaki, aiming to “tie” executives to the international expansion plan described to newmoney by co-founder Thomas Douzis: from new Ergon House locations and foreign markets to the ambition of building a Mediterranean brand with global reach. In practice, therefore, the program translates into a tool for participation in future added value and a move that shows Ergon no longer operates with the logic of a “family business,” but under the terms of a growth company playing on an international field. Kousta’s entry into LNG Danaos Corp’s investment in the Alaska LNG liquefied natural gas project marks a shift in the company’s strategy beyond traditional container shipping. With the $50 million investment, it deploys part of the approximately $1 billion in cash it accumulated over the past three years, moving capital from a market characterized by intense volatility such as containers to an energy transportation market with greater revenue stability. Danaos is not investing in shares but is envisaged as a preferred vessel provider for at least six LNG carriers, leveraging its expertise in maritime transport of large cargoes. This implies that Danaos will build or manage at least six specialized vessels for this LNG transport. In this way, it creates a new revenue stream not directly linked to its core activity, reducing exposure to fluctuations in container freight rates. At the same time, the investment aligns with the United States, which is promoting domestic LNG production as a strategic energy resource. Danaos enters a project with strong political backing and commercial commitments in Asia, thus reducing regulatory and geopolitical risk. Simultaneously with its entry into cargo vessels—capesize bulkers—Danaos shows that it wants to diversify its revenue sources. The strategic move of Olympic Shipping & Management The recent chartering of the VLCC supertankers Olympic Laurel and Olympic Trophy to Shell for three years by Onassis-controlled Olympic Shipping & Management is not merely a commercial agreement but a clear statement to the global energy market. With scrubber-fitted VLCCs earning up to $122,600/day in spot rates, the company secures stable premium revenues while simultaneously reducing exposure to market volatility. The Greek company exploits these realignments, strategically securing interests with leading oil companies, while the choice of long-term contracts places it at the heart of energy flows between the Middle East, Asia, and Europe. Olympic Shipping & Management leverages technology, experience, and timing to shape balances in the oil market. Greek shipping, continuing the tradition of Aristotle Onassis, maintains control over critical nodes of international energy and sends the message that it remains a protagonist even in periods of intense instability. At the same time, Aramco Trading chartered Maria Angelicoussis’ “Maran Mars” for three years at $52,000/day, and Mitsui OSK Lines chartered Angeliki Frangou’s “Nave Allegro” for five years at $44,000/day. The moral of the story is that Greek-owned shipping achieves higher charter rates and more favorable terms compared to major Middle Eastern and Asian players, confirming its strategic superiority. Oikonomou strategically locks in newbuilds Giorgos Oikonomou appears to be rewriting his playbook in the tanker sector with his latest move. The TMS Group acquired two newbuild suezmax tankers, which had initially been reserved for John Fredriksen and Seatankers. Financial analysts note that this is not merely a deal but a strategic coup. TMS is essentially “strolling” into a market where slots for newbuildings are scarce and demand has surged due to geopolitical realignments—more specifically, trade flows of Russian oil to India and China. With these two new orders, TMS increases its suezmax fleet to six vessels, strengthening its presence in a global fleet that traditionally yields high returns on difficult routes, such as transporting crude from Northern Russia and Black Sea ports. This move gains strategic depth when viewed as part of a broader trend of Greek shipowners “snapping up” new tanker order slots. Oikonomou essentially capitalized on a window of opportunity left by Seatankers, showing that TMS has the flexibility and capital to move quickly, even when major shipping deals are overturned. The story also has a geopolitical flavor. The dependence of suezmaxes on Russian flows, combined with the potential restriction of the “shadow fleet,” opens opportunities for “mainstream” shipowners like Oikonomou. Aktor at a new high and the rally in refineries Aktor is in a favorable phase, recording three consecutive positive sessions, resulting in the share reaching an important milestone and closing at €10.16. At the same time, the group’s market capitalization now exceeds €2 billion. Refineries took center stage yesterday, with buyers flocking en masse to Motor Oil and HELLENiQ ENERGY, in the wake of a report published by Pantelakis Securities on the sector. MOH recorded a jump of 4.3%, returned above €31, and is within striking distance of the all-time high of €31.48 recorded on December 22, 2025. Similarly, HELLENiQ ENERGY rose by 2.8% and moved above €8.7, with the next target being the seven-year highs of €9. Pantelakis set the bar at €40 for Motor Oil and €10 for HELLENiQ ENERGY, with an overweight recommendation for both refineries. Cenergy Holdings also recorded six consecutive gains, extending its all-time record and closing at €17.6. KRI-KRI’s bet in Aspropyrgos The small dairy company from Serres, KRI-KRI, has grown. It is now worth €658 million, that is, 24% more than around this time last year. Its weapon is one word: “exports.” Hence KRI-KRI’s next investment in creating a logistics center in Aspropyrgos, Attica, is only natural. Today, nearly 7 out of every 10 euros that KRI-KRI earns from dairy products come from international markets. The company closed 2025 with turnover of around €300 million. Aspropyrgos, apart from bordering Piraeus, has now established itself as the country’s absolute logistics hub, with rental prices reaching €5.8/sq.m. per month (+19% over five years) and land prices at €120,000–130,000 per stremma. Major retail companies (IKEA, Sklavenitis, Galaxias, METRO, etc.) are investing hundreds of millions in the area. For KRI-KRI, the Aspropyrgos center will function as a bridge: on the one hand serving the Attica market, where yogurt sales increased by 5.8%, and on the other facilitating export logistics via Piraeus. Naturally, all this is accompanied by increased production capacity through the major €52.2 million investment at the Serres factory. The changing of the guard and compensation A “changing of the guard” took place at EBIOP-TEMBO, the electrical equipment manufacturing company based in Chalkida and controlled by Siemens. At the end of October, the German CEO at the time, Dennis Julian Schubert, resigned and was replaced by fellow German Felix-Alfred Uebelhack, a Siemens Group executive, seconded to the company by shareholder Siemens A.E. to cover the CEO position effective from 01.11.2025. What is of interest now is the projected remuneration of the new CEO. Based on the relevant terms of the contract with Siemens for the secondment of this executive, the duration is three years, from 15.10.2025 to 14.10.2028, with the possibility of extension. The gross annual fixed remuneration during the secondment amounts to €129,268, while the gross annual variable remuneration in case of 100% target achievement—i.e., the bonus—is €32,317. The “other net annual allowances (housing, family, etc.)” reach €19,500, in addition to any other provided benefits “according to the contract concluded between him and Siemens AG.” There is also a “billing” clause according to which billing is done monthly, with a 5% profit margin in addition to the cost of the executive, excluding costs stipulated in the contract to be directly covered by the company. €3.8 billion absorbed in 12 minutes! Europe’s stock market is “thirsty” for defense stocks. Twelve minutes. That was the time it took for the €3.8 billion IPO of the Czech defense industry Czechoslovak Group (CSG) to be fully subscribed by institutional investors. Not hours, not days—twelve minutes that reveal much about Europe’s new geopolitical reality. CSG’s IPO in Amsterdam values the company at €25 billion. Controlled by 33-year-old billionaire Michal Strnad, CSG entered the market with impressive figures: revenues of €4.5 billion in the first nine months of 2025 (+82% year-on-year), an EBITDA margin of 26.4%, and… an order backlog of €14 billion. It is the second-largest producer of medium- and large-caliber ammunition in Europe, and the world’s largest in small caliber. The participation of cornerstone investors—Artisan Partners, BlackRock, and Qatar’s Al-Rayyan—with total commitments of €900 million set the tone for the new era. The STOXX Europe Targeted Defence index is again flirting with record highs, five times above levels of three years ago. Europe is “rearming,” and CSG—with 68% of its revenues from NATO countries and 26% from Ukraine—stands exactly at the epicenter of this upheaval. Trump predicts a stock triumph; Americans can’t afford natural gas In just two days, natural gas prices in America rose by +60%. One could attribute the explosive increase to the “Arctic freeze” that swept across the U.S. Perhaps, however, this explanation alone is not sufficient. Most Wall Street hedge fund managers had increased their short positions in natural gas, betting on lower prices due to the mild winter. The sudden change in weather boosted heating demand and triggered a classic short squeeze, with optimistic speculators hurriedly closing their positions, accelerating the rise in natural gas prices. There is, however, another detail, and it concerns liquefied natural gas infrastructure on the other side of the Atlantic. The U.S. has now evolved into a leading exporter of LNG, supplying Europe after exerting intense pressure on it to disengage from Russian gas. But when domestic inventories are strained by extreme weather conditions, arbitrage is created between domestic consumption and export contracts. The messages from this chaotic situation are many. First and foremost, storage capacity. Storage capacity is the new gold of the energy map. Second, climate change—which Trump denies—yet produces extreme weather conditions and turns energy commodities into a game of Russian roulette. Markets no longer price average demand, but extreme events. Explore related questions

Title: Microsoft CEO urges AI developers “to get to a point where we are using this to do something useful,” or “lose even the social permission...to generate these tokens”

Nadella tells Davos that AI’s legitimacy hinges on making people's lives better When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is concerned that if artificial intelligence doesn’t start delivering real, measurable benefits to society, people will be fed up with it and its price, ending its current form of existence. The Davos stage is an odd venue and audience to preach societal good over other goods, but it certainly helped his comments stand out. AI developers "have to get to a point where we are using this to do something useful that changes the outcomes of people and communities and countries and industries. Otherwise, I don't think this makes much sense," Nadella explained during a conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. "We will quickly lose even the social permission to take something like energy, which is a scarce resource, and use it to generate these tokens, if these tokens are not improving health outcomes, education outcomes, public sector efficiency, private sector competitiveness, across all sectors, small and large." The Davos crowd, used to a more digital transformation cheerleading role, sounded a little confused. But the discussion also shows how the AI hype train is both an illusion and real. Nadella should know what he's talking about. Microsoft is one of the biggest drivers of the current AI boom, with tens of billions of dollars invested in OpenAI, its own Copilot suite baked into productivity tools, and a seat at nearly every major AI policy table. But his message at Davos was that leadership now demands a reckoning – not just about how smart or useful AI tools are in theory, but whether they’re helping people in schools, clinics, small businesses, and city governments. That’s not an abstract moral argument. It’s an infrastructure one. AI’s growth has been driven by immense computational muscle, which means it’s also driven by massive energy use. Training today's biggest models consumes as much electricity as some small countries consume in a year. And inference, when you run the model on your phone or desktop to answer a question or generate a response, adds to that cost every second it runs. AI doesn’t just use servers; it fuels an ever-expanding footprint of data centers, water-cooled systems, and grid-straining workloads. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Nadella’s social permission phrase gets to the heart of what might be next. Until now, the public has broadly accepted that cloud-based tech companies can use resources in exchange for productivity, entertainment, or convenience. But that goodwill isn’t guaranteed. If AI begins to look like a wasteful luxury, delivering novelty rather than necessity, citizens and governments may start to push back. During the session, Larry Fink asked whether all this productivity talk would mean fewer jobs, and Nadella didn’t dismiss the concern. But he argued that AI’s potential lies in amplifying what people can do. But this moment is different from past tech inflection points. The sheer scale of AI's appetite. Cloud computing scaled gradually. Smartphones had physical limits. But AI can grow as fast as the models and capital behind it allow. That’s why Nadella’s call to focus on outcomes comes off as cautious as well as pragmatic. Nadella’s message was simple but sharp: we are nearing the edge of public tolerance for black-box systems powered by opaque amounts of energy, with unclear societal benefits. And maybe we should all be asking harder questions when the next shiny AI tool drops: Does this help me? Does it help someone? Or is it just burning energy to generate yet another token?

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. MUMBAI: India’s wealth management industry is scrambling to scale as a growing pool of household financial wealth remains underserved. Of the at least $1.1 trillion held by the country’s top households, defined as those with annual incomes of $25,000 or more, at the end of FY24, only about $0.7 trillion was addressed by registered wealth managers, according to a 2025 Deloitte report. This leaves an estimated $0.4 trillion in unmet demand. This pool of household wealth is being serviced by a limited universe of private wealth managers, financial advisers, mutual fund distributors and registered investment advisers. Specialized wealth managers are only able to meet 11% of the demands of the country's top 1% households, as per a Bernstein report from 2025. These include listed platforms like 360 One Wealth, Anand Rathi Wealth, Nuvama Wealth, as well as private players like Kotak Wealth, Julius Baer India. Waterfield Advisors, and Avendus Wealth. Most high-net-worth and ultra-high-net-worth demand, Bernstein noted, remains either self-managed, handled by accountants, or serviced by domestic banks and brokers offering limited customization, as well as independent advisers that lack scale. The imbalance has turned wealth management into one of the country’s most active dealmaking sectors, drawing global banks, foreign asset managers and domestic lenders eager to secure access to India’s affluent and ultra-high-net-worth clients. “The velocity at which investable capital is forming in India has surpassed the speed at which many institutions can build organic advisory capability," said Feroze Azeez, joint CEO of Anand Rathi Wealth. The scarcity of established platforms, he said, is drawing foreign capital seeking direct access to Indian wealth while pushing domestic banks to race for specialized capabilities. India is now among the world’s fastest-growing wealth markets, with wealth creation accelerating across entrepreneurs, professionals and salaried classes, said Prakash Bulusu, joint CEO of IIFL Capital. “This expanding client base demands personalized investment advisory services…Those rare firms offering all services are in focus." The opportunity is only expected to widen. Bernstein estimates that the country’s serviceable wealth is expected to triple from $3 trillion in FY25 to $9 trillion by FY35. Firms race for scaleSeveral international and domestic banks, and asset managers are moving quickly to capture a share of this growth. Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. and Emirates NBD Bank, which recently received Reserve Bank of India approval to set up wholly owned subsidiaries, are still deciding whether to build organically or acquire existing platforms, according to two people aware of the matter. Jefferies is also looking to enter India’s mutual fund space through an organic buildout, a third person said. SMBC, Emirates NBD did not respond to emailed queries, while a Jefferies spokesperson refused to comment. Domestic players are also reassessing growth strategies. Mint reported earlier this month that investment bank DAM Capital is preparing for a potential foray into wealth management and alternative investment funds. Some deals are already delivering shortcuts to scale. Boston-based State Street Corp. recently invested ₹580 crore in fintech platform Groww’s asset management business. Last month, Mizuho Financial Group agreed to acquire KKR’s majority stake in Avendus Capital, giving the Japanese lender immediate access to the firm’s ultra-high-net-worth client relationships. Deutsche Bank AG’s India retail and wealth management business, valued at $2.5 billion, has reportedly drawn binding bids from Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd and Federal Bank Ltd. Affluence fuels the rushThe primary driver of this deal activity is the rise of India's affluent class, industry experts explained. They said that the number of high-net-worth and ultra-high-net-worth individuals in India has surged in recent years, fuelling demand for sophisticated wealth management services. In 2025, India had four of the top 10 cities globally for ultra-high-net-worth individuals, according to wealth intelligence firm Altrata – the financial hub of Mumbai; Bengaluru and Hyderabad, centres for IT and business services; and the national capital, Delhi. The Mercedes-Benz Hurun India Wealth Report 2025 noted nearly a 200% rise in India’s millionaire households. It estimated that India now has 871,700 households with net worth above ₹8.5 crore, or approximately $1 million, almost double the 2021 figure of 458,000, representing 0.31% of all households. Between 2017 and 2025, million-dollar households grew 45%, though only a small share entered ultra-rich categories. The report also found that 83% of respondents remained confident about India’s economic growth over the next three years. The surge in India mirrors a global trend. In 2025, M&A targeting investment and wealth management firms surged as firms repositioned for rising demand in alternatives and a multi-trillion-dollar generational wealth transfer, with deal volumes at record highs globally. As per Deloitte 2026 Investment Management Outlook report, deal volume in the first half of 2025 jumped 46% year-on-year, making it the most active first half in more than a decade. As in 2023, a substantial share of these transactions targeted wealth management and investment advisory firms. “The continued expansion of alternative investment offerings helps underscore the vital role wealth management firms can play in helping high-net-worth individuals and retail investors make informed investment decisions," the same report said. “Additionally, with trillions of dollars set to shift between generations over the coming decades, many investment firms are taking notice and positioning themselves accordingly." India’s current wave of deals builds on a key consolidation in early 2025, when 360 ONE WAM Ltd acquired UBS Group AG’s onshore India wealth management business, consolidating roughly 80 family office relationships alongside its assets under management. UBS retained a minority stake rather than continuing independently.

PHOTO: BLOOMBERG PublishedÂ Jan 22, 2026, 07:42 AM UpdatedÂ Jan 23, 2026, 03:02 PM DAVOS, Switzerland - As artificial intelligence (AI) threatens to upend job markets in countries around the world, Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang brushed off longer-term concerns and made the case that skilled vocational workers are seeing increasing demand now. Plumbers, electricians and construction workers are going to be able to command âsix-figure salariesâ, thanks to demand to build data centres that run and train AI, he said in an interview with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan 21. The technology will require one of the biggest infrastructure build-outs in history, with trillions of dollars in new investment, Mr Huang said. âWeâre seeing quite a significant boom in this area. Salaries have gone up nearly double,â he said. âEverybody should be able to make a great living. You donât need to have a PhD in computer science to do so.â Mr Huangâs comments echo remarks made at Davos on Jan 20 by Palantir Technologies CEO Alex Karp, who praised workers with âvocational trainingâ and said AI would create more local jobs and largely eliminate the need for mass immigration. Coreweave CEO Michael Intrator also touched on the âphysicalityâ of the AI boom at a panel later on Jan 21, describing the need for growing numbers of plumbers, electricians and carpenters.Â Nvidia, the leading maker of chips that help power and run the latest AI models, has benefited from the huge rush to build data centres. The company is on track to generate almost US$200 billion (S$256.7 billion) in data centre chip sales for 2025, according to an average analyst estimate compiled by Bloomberg. To date, the bulk of its revenue comes from the biggest data centre builders â Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon.com, Alphabet â but it is striking deals with a growing number of smaller data centre operators. Tech firms have committed to spending a combined US$500 billion in data centre leases in the coming years. AIâs impact on the job market is already being felt. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has warned about a âwhite-collar bloodbathâ that could wipe out 50 per cent of entry-level jobs. The companyâs Claude AI is gaining attention for its coding abilities, a feature that could displace more junior programmers.Â âWeâre entering a world where the (tasks of) junior-level software engineers â maybe many of the tasks of the more senior-level software engineers â are starting to be done most of the way by AI systems. Now thatâs going to go further,â Mr Amodei said in an interview at Davos on Jan 20. While he believes the good from the technology will outweigh the bad, high unemployment and underemployment are risks that need to be mitigated.Â âThereâs going to be unfortunately a whole class of people who are, across a lot of industries, going to have a hard time coping,â he said.Â On Jan 21, Mr Fink noticeably avoided probing Mr Huang on sensitive topics, most notably China. Nvidiaâs sales to the country are controversial, and the company is waiting to hear whether it will be able to sell its chips to the country and in what quantities. Just on Jan 20, Mr Amodei likened shipping Nvidia chips into China to selling nuclear weapons to North Korea.Â Mr Huang is expected to visit China at the end of January as he works to reopen a crucial market for the companyâs AI chips. It is a pivotal time for the business, after the United States moved to ease limits on chip exports to China which it has had in place since 2022. Nvidia is still blocked from shipping the top-of-the-line chips to the country, stymieing Beijingâs ability to innovate beyond the cutting-edge of AI, but will be able to ship older-generation H200 AI chips. China, meanwhile, is expected to clear H200 imports for commercial use in the first three months of 2026, though it will not allow the chips for use in the military, sensitive government agencies, critical infrastructure or its state-owned enterprises, Bloomberg News reported. Some of the countryâs most prominent tech firms, including Alibaba Group and ByteDance, have privately expressed interest in ordering more than 200,000 units each of the chip.Â BLOOMBERG Nvidia AI/artificial intelligence Employment E-paper Newsletters Podcasts RSS Feed About Us Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy Need help?

Pondering whether Ethereum could become the “toll road” to blockchain-based markets, the report stated that Ethereum “could be poised to benefit” from a shift spurring moves across legacy financial institutions, from DTCC to the New York Stock Exchange. Ethereum currently underpins 65% of tokenized assets, according to the report. Meanwhile, the adoption of stablecoins is outpacing spot crypto trading volumes, suggesting that “tokenized assets may have a use-case outside of purely speculative trading.” The second-largest digital asset by market cap has the potential to accrue value if a growing number of firms tap Ethereum for creating digital representations of real-world assets, according to Jay Jacobs, U.S. Head of Equity ETFs at BlackRock. He authored the report. “If we see more tokenized assets utilizing the Ethereum blockchain, ultimately, you would see it be a beneficiary of additional trading activity, [and the] issuance of things like stablecoins or real- world assets,” Jacobs told Decrypt. “If you’re an investor looking to play the growing adoption of blockchain technology, one of the best and probably fastest-growing use cases right now is tokenization, and Ethereum is a beneficiary of that trend,” he added. Although a pie chart included in the report references 10 networks capable of supporting tokenized assets, Bitcoin and Ethereum are the only ones that are mentioned elsewhere, suggesting that the world’s largest asset manager has a distinct view toward them. The report didn’t include assets tokenized on Canton Network either. The permissioned blockchain, which was recently tapped by DTCC for its tokenization pilot, is currently used as a record-keeping layer for $362 billion in real-world assets, according to RWA.xyz. Ethereum, meanwhile, supports $13.2 billion in real-world assets that can be managed in-wallet. When it comes to BlackRock’s tokenized money market fund, BUIDL, the $1.6 billion product primarily exists on Ethereum ($499 million) and Binance’s BNB Chain ($503 million). Broadly, Jacobs said there’s a lot of interest in what BlackRock is calling “the convergence,” where traditional markets are becoming increasingly interconnected with crypto. He pointed to spot exchange-traded funds for digital assets as an example. BlackRock is behind the largest ETFs for Bitcoin and Ethereum, which have $70.6 billion and $10.7 billion in assets under management, respectively, according to CoinGlass. The firm has stood by as competitors have created products for other digital assets like XRP and Solana. “You have traditional securities and assets that are looking to be tokenized, and frankly, you have [digital] assets that [...] are making their way into the more traditional financial systems,” he said. “We believe in that convergence that does seem to be accelerating.” Still, Jacobs said that there are plenty of pieces that need to fall into place, whether that’s regulatory policy or company-level policy. Last year, the SEC created a task force to develop a “comprehensive and clear” regulatory framework for digital assets, but the expected passage of a market structure bill could also shape the regulator’s treatment of tokenized assets. What’s more, if firms want to take advantage of capabilities like around-the-clock trading or instant settlement through tokenization—qualities that BlackRock CEO Larry Fink first highlighted in 2022—then Jacobs said there would need to be the development of a supportive market around the technology across a variety of assets. “It’s early,” he said. “There's a lot of interest across financial firms to support this convergence right now, but not all innovation happens in a straight line—and ultimately, you need to see the benefits of tokenization materialized for the investors and trading community.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2026 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Former Vice President Al Gore briefly accosted Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick after the Trump official’s speech on the sidelines of this week’s World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, The Post has learned. During a Tuesday VIP dinner hosted by billionaire BlackRock boss Larry Fink, where several hundred people were invited, Lutnick delivered a speech that was fiercely critical of European allies. When he stepped offstage, Gore walked up to him and said, “Boo” — like he was trying to scare him, a source told The Post. Lutnick laughed and someone at the event remarked, “What an honor to have Al Gore boo,” according to an insider. The ex-veep confirmed he’d disliked the speech. “I sat and listened to his remarks,” the avid environmentalist told The Post in a statement. “I didn’t interrupt him in any way. It’s no secret that I think this administration’s energy policy is insane. And at the end of his speech I reacted with how I felt, and so did several others.” According to media reports, a number of other crowd members booed while attendees including European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde left the dinner before dessert was served. Fink reportedly tried to calm the audience as guests made for the exits. But a Commerce Department spokesperson and a BlackRock exec said Lagarde actually left before the remarks. “No one left hastily. Only one person booed and it was Al Gore,” a Commerce rep told The Post. Morning Report delivers the latest news, videos, photos and more. Please provide a valid email.

Lagarde reportedly made a dash for the door as Lutnick argued that Europe was losing global influence — adding to tensions as President Trump ramped up his threats to take over Greenland. Just a day before the speech, the commerce secretary wrote a bold opinion piece for the Financial Times, stating: “We are here at Davos to make one thing crystal clear: With President Trump, capitalism has a new sheriff in town.” “For far too long, the fate of the global economy has been decided by an international establishment who took America’s economic power and gave it to the rest of the world,” he wrote.

Institutional investors and crypto whales viewed the ETH price drop below $3,000 as a buying opportunity, but data still hints at a deeper sell-off to $2,700. Cointelegraph in your social feed Ether (ETH) price saw a daily candle close below $3,000 on Tuesday, but a positive is that data showed large holders were buying throughout the dip. While ETH whale accumulation signals growing confidence, conflicting indicators suggest rising market risk for the altcoin. Key takeaways: ETH whales and institutional investors bought over $130 million in Ether as the price closed below $3,000 on Tuesday. BitMine added more than 92,500 ETH in January, showcasing the growing demand for staking yield. ETH dropped 7.83% to $2,938 on Tuesday, marking its largest daily correction since November 4, 2025. Despite the drop, onchain tracker Lookonchain reported ETH accumulation from whales and institutional investors. According to the data, Trend Research borrowed 70 million USDt (USDT) from Aave to buy 24,555 ETH worth $75.5 million, bringing its total holdings to 651,310 ETH valued at $1.92 billion. Separately, an OTC whale address acquired 20,000 ETH, worth $58.8 million, via FalconX and Wintermute. Institutional investor accumulation of ETH extended beyond trading desks. BitMine has added 92,511 ETH in January, valued at $268 million. The ETH treasury company said it expects to become the largest Ethereum staking entity once its planned 4.2 million ETH is fully staked, generating an estimated $367 million to $393 million annually in staking rewards. The company added that it projects another $35 million to $40 million in income from cash operations. However, not all large capital flows were supportive. On Wednesday, BlackRock transferred 30,828 ETH worth about $91 million to Coinbase Prime, fueling concerns over potential sell-side volatility. Related: ETH derivatives metric turns positive after years of sell-side dominance From a technical standpoint, ETH’s longer-term chart suffered a bearish shift after closing below $3,000. The move also pushed the price below the four-month point of control near $3,100, the level where the highest volume traded over that period, signaling that the market has lost its most accepted price range. The breakdown coincided with a bearish break of structure (BOS), suggesting trend continuation to the downside. Based on current liquidity clusters, ETH could eventually test external liquidity zones around $2,718 and $2,620. Over the past 24 hours, $287 million in leveraged positions were liquidated, with longs accounting for $257 million, highlighting forced selling pressure. Data from Hyblock adds to the cautious mood. The whale versus retail delta has flipped negative, falling to -6,480 for ETH, indicating that whales are reducing their long exposure or adding shorts more aggressively than retail traders. Such shifts have preceded periods of heightened short-term volatility. On the other hand, 76% of retail traders are in long positions, pointing to the potential for a price reversal near the key swing lows.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick was heckled by former Vice President Al Gore during a World Economic Forum (WEF) event in Davos, Switzerland on Tuesday, according to news coverage. Gore booed Lutnick while the Commerce secretary was giving a speech at an invite-only dinner event hosted by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, Mediaite reported on Wednesday. The report comes after Lutnick criticized Europe during his remarks, which prompted European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde to suddenly leave the dinner event, multiple outlets reported. (RELATED: ‘I Press My Own Buttons’: Al Gore Goes On Unhinged Rant During UN Climate Summit) “I sat and listened to his remarks,” Gore said Wednesday in a statement provided to Mediaite. “I didn’t interrupt him in any way. It’s no secret that I think this administration’s energy policy is insane.” “And at the end of his speech I reacted with how I felt, and so did several others,” Gore continued. The WEF and a representative for Gore each did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment. “During Secretary Lutnick’s three-minute speech, no one left hastily,” a Commerce Department spokesperson told the DCNF in a statement on Wednesday. “Only one person booed, and it was Al Gore.” Moreover, Fox Business Network Senior Correspondent Charles Gasparino wrote in a Wednesday X post that he was told by a “reliable” anonymous source that “at the dinner Lagarde walked out BEFORE [Lutnick’s] speech and was tired like everyone is at Davos.” Former US Vice President Al Gore speaks to the press during the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting in Davos on January 21, 2026. (Photo by Fabrice COFFRINI/AFP via Getty Images) Lutnick claimed in an op-ed published by the Financial Times on Tuesday that the Trump administration was “not going to Davos to uphold the status quo,” but instead was going “to confront it head-on.” “For far too long, the fate of the global economy has been decided by an international establishment who took America’s economic power and gave it to the rest of the world,” Lutnick wrote. “Some of our past leaders believed the lies that offshoring was necessary, borders were not, and our national interest needed to submit to global lower cost of labour for the common good. That approach failed the US, crushed American workers and ripped apart most of the rest of the world as well. It destroyed industries, weakened supply chains and left working people in most western countries behind.” Gore suggested Wednesday that U.S. government policy should promote “regenerative agriculture” during a panel discussion at the WEF. Gore added that the U.S. needs “policies that [are] in recognition of the fact that governments around the world typically do subsidize farming, but don’t subsidize them in ways that incentivize them to go in the wrong direction, but incentivize them to go in the right direction.” Gore, the failed 2000 Democratic presidential nominee, is the cofounder and chairman of Generation Investment Management, and also the founder and chairman of The Climate Reality Project, a nonprofit organization which aims to combat the “climate crisis,” according to a biography on his website.

Title: Palantir CEO: AI Technology Reduces the Need for Skilled Migration
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2026/01/21/palantir-ceo-ai-technology-reduces-the-need-for-skilled-migration/
Time Published: 2026-01-21T20:26:34Z
Full Content:
There is little need for large-scale migration into U.S. jobs while Americans’ productivity is being turbocharged by artificial intelligence, according to Alex Karp, CEO of the fast-growing Palantir Technologies. “I do think these trends really do make it hard to imagine why we should have large-scale immigration unless you have a very specialized skill,” Karp told an elite audience at the 2026 World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland. The technology will replace many white-collar jobs, he said, adding, “There will be more than enough jobs for the citizens of your nation, especially those with vocational training.” The statement is good news for the millions of American college graduates who have been pushed out of careers and prosperity by a huge inflow of mostly Indian H-1B visa workers. The imported visa workforce has been used to sideline outspoken American professionals and to create a backroom economy of kickbacks that enriches U.S. and Indian managers, chokes innovation, and defrauds stockholders. Clever people will prosper even as the AI technology performs more white-collar tasks, Karp said: The person managing our Maven [intelligence] system in the U.S. Army is a former police officer who I think, went to a junior college. They’re doing very, very high-end, very complicated targeting globally, and that person actually is irreplaceable. I think in the past, the way we tested for aptitude would not have fully exposed how irreplaceable that person’s talents are — and would [that person] have been as talented if they had not gone to their college? Overall, the AI technology will help well-managed communities, he said. “America and China… work at scale, and I think that is very likely to accelerate way beyond what most people believe is possible,” said Karp. Worldwide, he said, “I would imagine… you’re just going to find pockets that go very well and pockets that go very poorly.” President Donald Trump echoes the technology-beats-migration theme in some of his speeches as he zig-zags between his business allies and his populist base. For example, in his January 21 speech at the Davos conference, he said: Our previously open and dangerous border is closed and virtually impenetrable, and the United States is in the midst of the fastest and most dramatic economic turnaround in our country’s history. Under the Biden administration, America was plagued by the nightmare of stagflation, meaning low growth and high inflation, a recipe for misery, failure, and decline. But now, after just one year of my policies, we’re witnessing these opposite — virtually no inflation at extraordinarily high economic growth. Many tech leaders say the fast-evolving AI technology will sweep away many traditional jobs in software, media, and other sectors. This technological revolution is allowing tech-sector CEOs to speak out against mass migration. For example, Elon Musk has also escalated his criticism of mass unskilled migration: “We cannot let [illegal migrants] stay… [because] democracy is the real issue,” said Palmer Lucky, the founder of Anduril Industries, a defense company: There is an effectively unlimited supply of poor people from poor countries that want to live in the United States who can be used to fuel this [Democratic political] strategy. Some [migrants] might be net positive to the US economy, some might not be, but that is beside the point — all [migrants] would equally contribute to a future where [the] minority rules the majority [with migrant votes] with no recourse. The new skepticism among CEOs about migration also comes amid the rising influence of Islam in the West, such as the election of Zohran Mamdani to the mayorship of New York. The pressure is swaying some influential CEOs against migration. “I can argue, in the developed countries, the big winners are the countries that have shrinking populations,” BlackRock founder and 2026 Davos chief Larry Fink said at a 2024 pro-globalist event hosted by the World Economic Forum in Saudi Arabia. He continued: That’s something that most people never talked about. We always used to think [a] shrinking population is a cause for negative [economic] growth. But in my conversations with the leadership of these large, developed countries [such as China, and Japan] that have xenophobic anti-immigration policies, they don’t allow anybody to come in — [so they have] shrinking demographics — these countries will rapidly develop robotics and AI and technology… If a promise of all that transforms productivity, which most of us think it will — we’ll be able to elevate the standard living in countries, the standard of living for individuals, even with shrinking populations. [Emphasis added.] Other CEOs argue that AI will create labor shortages. Progressive demands for power and cash are also pushing tech leaders away from migration advocacy and toward compromises with the GOP’s base of American voters. For example, California investor Jason Calacanis posted on January 20: tech was historically 85 percent+ “socially-liberal moderates partnered with democrats” and 15 percent *quietly* republican In 2026, it’s flipped with ~70 percent of folks are now “social-liberal moderates partnered with republicans.” The socially-liberal moderates are the majority, and the democrats pushed these folks out of the party with the DEI, ESG, socialist, and “deranged woke” ideologies. Founders/tech just want to work, pay their taxes, be left alone to build and have a seat at the table on the margins. Meanwhile, many progressives and their migrant allies are pushing for more migration. Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting. Copyright © 2026 Breitbart

Title: Bitcoin is in the blast radius after Japan’s bond market hit a terrifying 30-year breaking point

As 40-year yields skyrocket past 4%, the sudden evaporation of cheap yen is forcing a messy global reset. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. At first glance, this looks like a story that lives on the back pages of a newspaper, Japanese government bonds with maturities that run so long they sound like a joke, 20 years, 30 years, 40 years. If you own Bitcoin, you still end up in the blast radius. Because when Japan’s long-dated bonds start to wobble, it is rarely just about Japan. It is about the world’s last big source of cheap money slowly turning into something more expensive, and what happens to every trade that quietly depended on that cheap funding. Japan has spent most of the last few decades as the place where money was close to free. That shaped global markets in a thousand small ways, even if you never bought a Japanese bond in your life. Now that era is fading. In December, the Bank of Japan lifted its benchmark rate to 0.75%, the highest level in roughly 30 years, part of a broader shift away from ultra-low policy that defined the country’s post-1990s playbook. That move matters because Japan is not a small player. It is a funding hub. It is a reference point. It is the place global investors could point to when they wanted to borrow cheaply, hedge later, and hunt for returns somewhere else. When that cheap anchor starts lifting, markets adjust, sometimes gently, sometimes all at once. With the BOJ letting rates run to levels not seen in decades, the structural "term premium" is rising, a direct headwind for long-duration crypto exposure. The fresh red flag is coming from the far end of Japan’s yield curve, the super-long bonds. Japan’s 40-year government bond yield pushed above 4% for the first time, hitting around 4.2% as selling pressure built, and a recent 20-year auction showed weaker demand with a bid-to-cover ratio of 3.19, below its 12-month average. Even if you do not live in bond world, that is the kind of detail traders circle with a thick marker. Auctions are where the market reveals how much real appetite exists for the debt being issued. When demand starts slipping at the long end, investors start asking harder questions about who the marginal buyer is going forward, and how much yield Japan will have to offer to keep funding itself smoothly. A second datapoint makes the shift feel less like a blip. Japan’s 30 year government bond yield has climbed to about 3.46%, up sharply from about 2.32% a year earlier. This is what a regime change looks like in slow motion, one auction, one basis point, one nervous headline at a time. Thin order books met hard macro triggers and the market snapped as it entered December. Crypto loves to tell stories about being outside the system. The price still lives inside the system. When rates rise, especially long-term rates, the entire market has to rethink what tomorrow’s cash is worth today. Higher yields raise the bar for every risky bet, stocks, private credit, venture, and yes, Bitcoin. BlackRock put it bluntly in a recent note on crypto volatility, Bitcoin has historically shown sensitivity to USD real rates, similar to gold and some emerging market currencies, even if its fundamentals do not depend on any single country’s economy. So when Japan’s moves ripple into global yields, Bitcoin can react before anyone finishes explaining the bond math on TV. We have already seen a version of that movie lately. Global bonds sold off after hawkish comments from BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda, and Bitcoin fell 5.5% in the same session, extending its monthly drop to more than 20%. That is the bridge between “Tokyo bond auction” and “why did my crypto portfolio just bleed.” Japan's 55% to 20% tax cut and crypto reclassification create institutional pathways where XRP already dominates $21.7 billion in JPY on-ramp volume and SBI's remittance infrastructure. There is a plumbing story here, and it matters more than the headlines. For years, one of the simplest trades in global finance was borrowing in yen at very low rates, then putting that money to work in higher-yielding assets elsewhere. It does not always show up as a single obvious position you can point at; it shows up as a backdrop, as a source of steady demand for risk and yield. When Japan tightens, that backdrop changes. If the yen strengthens or funding costs rise, that carry trade can unwind. Unwinds tend to be messy because they are driven by risk limits, margin calls, and crowded exits. The Bank for International Settlements studied a volatility burst and carry trade unwind in August 2024 and described how large FX carry positions were especially sensitive to spikes in volatility and were forced to unwind quickly. You do not need to believe crypto is “part of the carry trade” to see the connection. You just need to accept that when leverage gets pulled out of the system, the most liquid risk assets often get sold first, and Bitcoin is one of the most liquid risk assets on the planet. Aggressive selling and whale activity reflects Bitcoin's struggle to maintain critical $90,000 level amid market-wide downturn The long end of Japan’s curve is reacting to policy uncertainty too. The 40-year yield jump is tied to investor anxiety over a snap election and fiscal plans, the kind of political catalyst that can turn a slow grind into a sudden lurch. Markets can tolerate a lot, they hate guessing games about issuance, spending, and the future buyer base for government debt. If investors begin to suspect Japan will be leaning more heavily on the bond market, and doing so while its central bank is less willing to suppress yields, they demand more compensation. That is what a rising long bond yield often represents, the market asking to be paid more for time and uncertainty. The durable question is simple, does Japan’s shift keep global financial conditions tighter than markets are expecting. If the answer is yes, crypto’s upside gets capped, rallies become choppier, leverage becomes more fragile, and every risk flare-up feels sharper. If the answer is no, and Japan’s transition stays orderly, then the bond market stops being the main character, and Bitcoin goes back to trading its usual mix of liquidity, positioning, and narrative. There are a few forward paths worth mapping, and none of them require pretending anyone can predict a Bitcoin candle. Japan continues raising rates gradually, the bond market absorbs it, auctions stay decent, yields stay high but stop behaving like a panic meter. In this world, the pressure on crypto shows up as a steady headwind. Higher risk-free returns compete with speculative appetite. Bitcoin can still run, especially if other forces turn supportive, but the market keeps looking over its shoulder at real yields. More weak auctions, more headlines about demand, more volatility at the long end. Global yields jump as relative value traders adjust and as investors worry about repatriation flows, then equities and crypto take the hit. The recent example is already on the tape, global bonds slid on hawkish BOJ signals, and Bitcoin dropped 5.5% on the day. This scenario tends to look like forced selling. Fundamentals become background noise. Japan’s officials push back hard against disorderly moves, issuance choices shift, bond buying operations, and guidance are used to cool volatility, and yields stop surging. That can loosen global conditions at the margin, simply by removing a source of stress. Bitcoin responds the same way it often does when the market senses less pressure from rates and funding. The point is not that Japan “helps crypto,” the point is that global liquidity expectations shift. Japan’s debt has soared to nearly 235% of GDP, an unprecedented level for a developed economy, with lessons for the U.S. and other countries borrowing without limits. If you want to stay ahead of the story, you do not need twenty indicators. You need a handful. This part gets missed in a lot of crypto coverage. Crypto has its own internal money system, stablecoins act like the cash register. When monetary policy shocks hit traditional markets, stablecoin liquidity can move too, which changes crypto market conditions even if on-chain narratives stay the same. A BIS working paper on stablecoins and monetary policy found that US monetary policy shocks drive developments in both crypto and traditional markets, while traditional markets do not react much to crypto shocks in the other direction. That supports the broader point that crypto is downstream of macro funding conditions more often than it wants to admit. Somewhere in Tokyo, there are insurers and pension managers staring at the same problem everyone is staring at, yield has returned, and it comes with volatility attached. Somewhere else, there is a crypto trader in New York or London watching Bitcoin chop sideways, wondering why a move in Japanese bonds is pulling on their screen. This is why. Japan is changing the price of money after decades of holding it down. That adjustment is reaching into every corner where leverage and risk live, and crypto sits right there, liquid, global, always open, always ready to react. If Japan’s bond market stays calm, crypto gets a cleaner runway. If Japan’s long end keeps throwing off stress signals, the market is going to keep learning the same lesson, Bitcoin trades on the future, and the future is priced in yields.

Denmark has welcomed Donald Trump‘s announcement that he will drop tariffs and rule out force to take Greenland, but warned that the US president still “has an ambition we can’t accommodate”. Mr Trump rowed back on his threat to slap tariffs on Nato allies who opposed his ambitions to annex Greenland on Wednesday night after he and the alliance’s chief “formed the framework of a future deal” for the Arctic region. In recent days Mr Trump had upped the pressure on Europe to cede control of Greenland or face the consequences, saying that Nato owed it to the US to grant it full rights to the territory. Denmark’s foreign minister, Lars Lokke Rasmussen, said on Wednesday night that the day had “ended better than it started” and it was “positive” that Mr Trump planned to end the trade war. “It is a signal, I hope, that we can now have talks with Trump’s people,” he said, adding that discussions needed to end in a way that “respects the Greenlandic people.” But he added: “Trump saying he won’t use force is a good signal, but it is still clear that Trump has an ambition that we can’t accommodate”. Swedish foreign minister Maria Malmer Stenergard ‍also welcomed the change in Mr Trump’s stance on ‍Greenland. “Good that Trump has now backed away from tariffs ⁠on those of us ⁠who have supported Denmark ⁠and Greenland,” she said on ‍X. “The demands about moving borders has received well-earned criticism. That is also why we have repeated that ‌we will ‌not be blackmailed. It appears that our ‌work together with allies has had ⁠an impact.” The European Union’s 27 leaders, meanwhile, will meet in Brussels on Thursday evening to game out a joint response to the developments. The European Council summit had been expected to discuss the prospects of talking the US president down from his demands that negotiations begin immediately to arrange the “sale” of Greenland from Denmark to the US. French president Emmanuel Macron had signalled that he wanted the EU to take a tougher stance in its relations with the White House than it has to date. Discussions between the European Commission and national capitals had indicated a clear desire from most governments to avoid an economically damaging trade war between Brussels and Washington. The EU summit had intended to sound out the levels of political support for various steps of possible retaliation, in the event the Trump administration proceeded with threats to levy fresh tariffs on Denmark and other EU countries on February 1st. An initial EU retaliation, limited to a package of counter-tariffs to hit up to €93 billion worth of US trade, had been on the agenda. The European Parliament, meanwhile, decided to suspend its work on the European ‍Union’s trade deal with the United States in protest at president Donald Trump’s demands ‍to acquire Greenland and threats of tariffs on European allies who oppose his plan. The EU assembly has been debating legislative proposals to remove many EU import duties ‌on US goods, a key part of the agreement struck in Turnberry, Scotland, at ⁠the end of July, as well as to continue zero duties ‌for ​US ‍lobsters, initially agreed with Trump in 2020. The proposals require approval by the parliament and EU governments. [ Trump’s Davos speech reflects how emboldened he has become and how ineffectual Europe isOpens in new window ] Many politicians have complained that the trade deal is lopsided, with the ⁠EU required to cut most import duties while the US sticks ⁠to a broad rate of 15 per cent. ⁠However, they had previously appeared willing to accept it, albeit with conditions, such as an 18-month sunset clause ‍and measures to respond to possible surges of US imports. The trade committee of the European Parliament was due to set its position in votes on January 26th-27th. However, this has now been postponed. The chair of the committee Bernd Lange told a news conference on Wednesday that the new tariff threats had ‌broken the Turnberry deal, ‌saying it would now be put on hold until further notice. However, freezing the deal risks angering Trump, which could lead ‌to higher US tariffs. The Trump administration has also ruled out any concessions, such ⁠as cutting tariffs on spirits or steel, until the deal is in place. Separately, European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde walked out of a dinner at the World Economic Forum during a speech critical of Europe by US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick. The ECB president exited during a passage of heavy criticism levelled at Europe by Mr Lutnick that drew heckling at the dinner on Tuesday night, said one of the sources who was briefed on what happened. The dinner was hosted by BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink as co-chairman of the World Economic Forum for all of the major members of the forum along with heads of state and other dignitaries, a person who was invited to it said. A couple of hundred people were invited to the dinner. Mr Fink ended the dinner before dessert after the heckling incident as people were walking out, one of the sources said. – Additional reporting by Reuters and Bloomberg Understand world events with Denis Staunton's Global Briefing newsletter Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Listen to In The News podcast daily for a deep dive on the stories that matter © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

The gathering on Tuesday night descended into uproar after combative remarks from Lutnick, according to several people present, with widespread jeering amid appeals for calm from BlackRock’s Larry Fink, the host of the event and interim co-chair of the WEF. Lagarde was among the attendees who walked out during the speech, according to people familiar with the matter. This year’s gathering in the Alps has the theme: “A spirit of dialogue.” Lutnick told his audience that the world should focus on coal as an energy source rather than renewables, according to one person present, and made dismissive comments about Europe… One chief executive present described the atmosphere as “tense”, while another said it was “noisy and spicy”. One of the hecklers was Al Gore, the former US vice-president, according to two executives present… Gore said: “I sat and listened to his remarks. I didn’t interrupt him in any way. It’s no secret that I think this administration’s energy policy is insane. And at the end of his speech I reacted with how I felt, and so did several others.” … Fink told the FT before the conference: “We are living in a more polarising world. There’s more people talking at each other, not to each other.” He added: “It is my role to elevate everybody and have a serious conversation.” US and EU relations are at a low ebb after the US president threatened to impose new tariffs on certain European countries if he is not allowed to “acquire” Greenland… Reuters adds: ECB President Christine Lagarde walked out of a dinner at the World Economic Forum during a speech critical of Europe by U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and the hosts called off the event before dessert, sources familiar with the matter said.

What a headache (and, perhaps, some serious comic relief) for the Davos crowd. I hope Lutnick and his conniving family go bankrupt. bjacques January 21, 2026 at 2:07 pm Nutlick the Human Pinky Ring… bbleh January 21, 2026 at 2:07 pm And I will bet actual money that — just like MAGAts who are criticized for openly offensive racist, sexist, homophobic, etc., remarks — the people around the Orange Guy will react resentfully and complain that they’re being unfairly victimized. They are SUCH a bunch of whiny 5-year-olds (and I’m sure I’m being unfair to many 5-year-olds). What an embarrassment for the US. And it won’t go away when they do .. @Elizabelle: the problem being, for all the childish whining, petulant demands, and blatant grifting, the US is still the biggest gorilla in the room. You might have a more serious discussion, but lacking THE major player, it would be considerably less useful. It does seem like this is finally getting some of the Euros to take the EU seriously as a unitary actor, which on balance is a good thing imo, but it comes very much at the expense of the US. The Trump people are systematically destroying a lot of our influence, both now and for the future. They couldn’t have done more if they were a cabal of hostile undercover operatives. It’s fkin mind-boggling. rikyrah January 21, 2026 at 2:08 pm Lutnick is a boot licking grifter. please research how HIS SONS are going to cash in once the Supreme Court comes down against Trump and the tariffs. rikyrah January 21, 2026 at 2:09 pm THEE ENTIRE PHUCK!! ROLAND IS ON POINT. THIS IS RIDICULOUS. Taniel @Taniel NEWS: No one filed to challenge the 2 conservative/GOP justices on the Nevada supreme court who are up for reelection this year.

This is harder than anyone might think. Sometimes, all you get is someone like me who is mildly curious. 2) Lack of support. What turned me off of my county Dems was that after the initial reaching out, it became very clear very quickly that they weren’t going to do much else. Every step of the process was something I was going to have to personally do. They didn’t even offer suggestions on people who could help manage the campaign. I was expected to just know this shit. 3) Lack/Mismanagement of resources. At the end of the day, even state party apparatus have disastrously little to work it. A lot of donations either go to the national level or to specific campaigns. And national level Dems seem to invest the bulk of that into consultants who do less than jack shit. Spanky January 21, 2026 at 2:25 pm Gore said: “I sat and listened to his remarks. I didn’t interrupt him in any way. It’s no secret that I think this administration’s energy policy is insane. And at the end of his speech I reacted with how I felt, and so did several others.” … Armpit noises? ArchTeryx January 21, 2026 at 2:29 pm Someone asked me to show my receipts so right here from Pew Research, who did a lot of the exit polling and crosstabs from the electorate. 2016: White women: 45% Clinton. 47% Trump. 2% majority to Trump. 2020: White women: 46% Biden, 53% Trump. 2% majority becomes a 7% majority. White women tripled down on Trump, in the middle of COVID. 2024: White women: 47% Harris, 51% Trump. 4% majority to Trump. >100% of the gender gap was black women. White women weren’t all in for Trump but gave him a majority, and in 2/3 cases, that was enough. So please, blow it out your arse, Princess. Sources: Pew research 2016. Pew research 2020. Pew research 2024. laura January 21, 2026 at 2:30 pm Was there any mention out of the dinner about Howard using a big old wheelbarrow to haul his balls out on stage and act a complete shite-bag? Deputinize America January 21, 2026 at 2:30 pm Nutlick should have been at work on 9/11. Old School January 21, 2026 at 2:32 pm Gore said: “I sat and listened to his remarks. I didn’t interrupt him in any way.” He’s learned his lesson about loud sighing. JML January 21, 2026 at 2:40 pm @rikyrah: it’s a bad miss, but finding good candidates to run for these kinds of judicial posts can be hard: they’re often not seen as good jobs. The salary is poor for anyone who is a rising star in the private sector of the legal field, and for people looking to become a judge, they want to go federal where the salaries still aren’t great but you never have to stand for election. Unfortunately it can be a hard sell for good candidates. now, to not field anyone is pretty brutal, but at the same time if you’re a young lawyer trying to make your way, is taking 6 months to a year off and running for judge a good career move? It’s so damn expensive. even if you don’t end up having to put your own money into it (and most people do, at least early on until they can raise some money), you end up having to quit your job or take a leave of absence and not get paid because running for office is a full-time job for any challenger. It sucks. I had a friend run for judge out in NV and it was really rough on her, and was compounded by her losing, despite being a great candidate. Jeffro January 21, 2026 at 2:41 pm yes, COAL, glorious COAL! preach it, Brother Lutnick!! there must be a word in German for “national suicide by rule of morons who deserve a fist in the face” Matt McIrvin January 21, 2026 at 2:44 pm @Jeffro: i think the word is “Nationalsozialismus” Scout211 January 21, 2026 at 2:45 pm Petty. Newsom barred from public address in Switzerland by the Trump administration Gov. Gavin Newsom was scheduled to speak during the World Economic Forum on Wednesday morning in Davos, Switzerland, but was barred from speaking at the very last minute by the White House, according to his office. “Under pressure from the White House and State Department, USA House (a church acting as the official US pavilion) is now denying entry to Governor Newsom after Fortune — the official media partner — invited him to speak,” the governor’s office said in a text to the governor’s press corps and later posted to the governor’s official X account. The USA House is the collection of official U.S. venues during the World Economic Forum. . . . “This came after multiple Trump Administration officials spokeat USA House throughout the day — including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who attacked the Governor earlier this morning, calling him ‘economically illiterate’ and ‘worse than Kamala,’” according to Newsom’s office. The governor’s office provided screenshots of texts and emails to the press corps to support its account. Matt McIrvin January 21, 2026 at 2:47 pm So, big change from last year when it seemed like all the big shots at Davos were happy as clams about Trump coming back, eh? Hasn’t worked out quite like they expected. JWR January 21, 2026 at 2:48 pm Just heard on TV news that Trump claims to have reached an agreement with whoever’s in charge at DAVOS and so no tariffs will be needed. We shall see. So, we can get back to The Epstein Files, right? PS. a bit of unwanted action from CBP: WILLOWBROOK, Calif. (KABC) — A federal agent opened fire during an operation Wednesday morning in Willowbrook, prompting a large response from local and federal authorities. […] No one was struck by gunfire, the sheriff’s spokesperson told ABC7, adding that all suspects targeted by the operation were detained and all officers were accounted for. Chief Oshkosh January 21, 2026 at 2:51 pm @Scout211: Maybe The Netherlands and Norway can offer Newsom venues for multiple speeches. Captain C January 21, 2026 at 2:52 pm @rikyrah: Isn’t this the state party that the Bend A Knee caucus took over? Or were they ousted, and if so how much damage did they leave? Deputinize America January 21, 2026 at 2:52 pm @Jeffro: He’s got Appalachian dimwits and fossil energy middlemen to placate. Belafon January 21, 2026 at 2:53 pm @Chief Oshkosh: He should record it and leak it online for someone to play at the forum. That’s how the administration gets things out. Baud January 21, 2026 at 2:54 pm @Matt McIrvin: Leopards eat international faces too. Baud January 21, 2026 at 2:55 pm @Captain C: There was a dust up a few years ago, but I think they have new people now. Probably had trouble finding people to run, as others said. Scout211 January 21, 2026 at 2:56 pm @JWR: Just heard on TV news that Trump claims to have reached an agreement with whoever’s in charge at DAVOS and so no tariffs will be needed The Details. President Donald Trump on Wednesday said that he would not impose tariffs on eight European countries that were set to go into effect on Feb. 1 unless those countries allowed the United States to take control of Greenland. . . . “Based upon a very productive meeting that I have had with the Secretary General of NATO, Mark Rutte, we have formed the framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland and, in fact, the entire Arctic Region,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Based upon this understanding, I will not be imposing the Tariffs that were scheduled to go into effect on February 1st,” he added. Trump had said if those countries did not comply with his demands by June, the tariff would rise to 25%. Trump’s comments over the weekend roiled global markets. Stocks soared to the highs of the day on Trump’s announcement that the tariffs were off. Sounds like TACO to me. “Frame work of a future deal.” LOL Stocks are sure overly emotional. They need to calm down. ;-) Belafon January 21, 2026 at 2:56 pm @Captain C: I’m curious. Did anyone volunteer to run and were told no? Deputinize America January 21, 2026 at 3:01 pm @JML: Campaigning for something like that in a state as spread out as Nevada would be a sonofabitch. My stint at campaigning for a family court slot in a relatively compact three county exurban circuit consisting of 634 square miles and 100,000 people (adjoining a large urban center, so broadcast and print media were prohibitive) is illustrative. I consumed a lot of nights and weekends on the rubber chicken circuit along with a lot of phone calls and 10K in cash, and didn’t make it out of the primary. For a State Supreme Court race, the election itself is a sacrifice – you’re giving up your family and friends for the better part of a year, and it is genuinely exhausting.

Baud January 21, 2026 at 3:02 pm @Scout211: 100% TACO. Sadly, it’s his best quality. Baud January 21, 2026 at 3:03 pm McGovern on Trump in Davos: Well, he said a lot of crazy shit today. I think it’s time to take the keys away from grandpa. He doesn’t seem like he’s all there. Another Scott January 21, 2026 at 3:05 pm @rikyrah: Roland seems to fishing for clicks, it seems to me. Ballotpedia.org: 2016 – Incumbent 71.6%, write-in remainder 2018 – No Incumbent. 45% / 32%, write-in remainder 2020 – Incumbent 77.4%, write-in remainder 2022 – No Incumbent. 75.9%, write-in remainder 2024 – Incumbent 69.7%, write-in remainder 2026 – 2 incumbents running for 2 seats It looks like incumbents get 70+% of the vote. Maybe Democrats would have a slightly better chance for open seats, but there aren’t any this year. Sensible prospective candidates have to pick their battles if they really want a chance to win. It’s really easy for opinion-havers to tell everyone else that they’re doing it wrong… FWIW. Thanks. Best wishes, Scott. Baud January 21, 2026 at 3:06 pm Senior CDC official: Loss of measles elimination status in U.S. would be ‘cost of doing business Bill Arnold January 21, 2026 at 3:06 pm @Jeffro: They’re really really going for RCP 8.5, Burn All The Fossil Carbon. That’s conservatively 5 degrees C (9 degrees F) of global heating from pre-industrial. That’s a premeditated multigigadeathcrime. NotMax January 21, 2026 at 3:14 pm Bessent talking in Davos about “retired parents who purchase 5, 10, even 12 homes,” also too. Baud January 21, 2026 at 3:15 pm @NotMax: Trump is a president for the working class. Geminid January 21, 2026 at 3:18 pm @ArchTeryx: That was me who asked you for more definite data. So if you want to tell someone to blow it out their ass, don’t tell Princess, tell me. But now I’m curious. Which of the various demographic groups are you in? I’ll go first. I’m a White male Democrat. And by the way: going from 45D-47R to 46D-53R is not “tripling down.” The margin tripled, not the the base numbers. So let me ask another question: what do you have against White women as a class? I doubt it’s just their political leanings. Suzanne January 21, 2026 at 3:22 pm @Baud: 100% TACO. Sadly, it’s his best quality. TACO trucks on every corner. Would have been so much better than this TACO. I just watched the entire Carney speech and that’s the real leader of the free world right there. Goddamn smart people give me a boner. cwmoss January 21, 2026 at 3:22 pm The USA is now like the thief in “The Cook, The Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover” except the thief in the movie was smart while we (the Royal We) are fucking idiots. JML January 21, 2026 at 3:23 pm @Deputinize America: you speak all truth. But thank you for your willingness to be a candidate, even if you didn’t make it out of the primary. And never sell your effort short! Baud January 21, 2026 at 3:26 pm @Suzanne: During Trump 1.0, it was Merkel who filled that role. By 2029, however, it is unlikely that any US president will have that honor again. It was tied to US credibility and strength, both of which are collapsing fast. Who knows? Maybe over time the planet will be better off with the new world order. MazeDancer January 21, 2026 at 3:28 pm And in other important global news: Prue Leith is leaving GBBO. ArchTeryx January 21, 2026 at 3:30 pm @Geminid: No, you made an honest request. It was Princess telling me to blow it out my ear because I said white women voted their race over their gender. I just provided the proof. I have a real, real big problem with bigots. I don’t give two hoots about what gender they are. White males are an ugly problem that we’ve had forever, but nobody is surprised when I tell them a wide majority of white men voted Trump. They’re very surprised when I tell that that despite Roe vs. Wade being stricken, a majority of white women still voted for Trump. After the Access Hollywood tape came out, a majority of white women still voted for Trump. That’s just pure bigotry. Dying of Whiteness, female edition. AFAIAC, bigots are bigots. They can all go to hell. They wanted this. I’m white cis heterosexual male. And being a lifetime D voter from GenX, *I* am in the gross minority. And it sucks. But there is zero I can do to change it. Most white males want me dead, too. gene108 January 21, 2026 at 3:31 pm I do not understand why rich fuckwads like Lutnick and Bessent are all in on the Trump 2.0 agenda. They constantly humiliate themselves anytime they speak to the media or give a speech. Old School January 21, 2026 at 3:36 pm @ArchTeryx: They can all go to hell. They wanted this. They being Trump voters, right? I’ll assume “they” doesn’t mean white women. Suzanne January 21, 2026 at 3:37 pm @Baud: Carney sees the threats clearly. We keep arguing here about “messaging” and “only Democrats have agency” and “vibes” and “performative outrage”, at the core….. all of those arguments are really circling around the same thing, which is that all of us Dems are fucking terrified right now and we are looking for signs that our leaders are seeing the threats as clearly as we need them to. Our party cannot respond appropriately if we do not fully grasp what we’re dealing with. It honestly made me feel good that Carney is completely and fully aware. I wish I could take my family and be under his leadership. ArchTeryx January 21, 2026 at 3:39 pm @Old School: Right. The white women – and white voters in general – that voted Trump. The ones that voted for Harris, I have nothing but admiration for. They’re the ones who should be running this country, but instead we got fascism. Because white supremacy uber alles is what the majority of white people vote for. Men and women. Little things like losing their right to bodily autonomy didn’t change white women’s voting patterns at all. White men’s has always sucked, especially from my Reaganaut generation. It got more pro fascist over time, not less. gene108 January 21, 2026 at 3:42 pm @chemiclord: 2) Lack of support.

You are being kind. Another Scott January 21, 2026 at 3:43 pm APNews.com headline: “Trump keeps calling Greenland ‘Iceland’ during Davos speech” Because of course he did. It’s all mouth noises to him. Now, about those Epstein Files… Best wishes, Scott. J. January 21, 2026 at 3:43 pm Can Davos ban Trump and his flunkies from attending? mrmoshpotato January 21, 2026 at 3:45 pm Lutnick told his audience that the world should focus on coal as an energy source rather than renewables You first, Howie. And pipe the coal smoke back into your house. trollhattan January 21, 2026 at 3:45 pm @Scout211: ​ Weirdly, Feb 1 is on Taco Sunday. Amen.

Archon January 21, 2026 at 3:49 pm @ArchTeryx: You can’t explain how and why the majority of white woman voted for Trump without mentioning racism and the appeal of white patriarchy to ALOT of white woman. In a way I understand, after all their fathers are white, their husbands are white and their sons are white. MazeDancer January 21, 2026 at 3:54 pm @Another Scott: Karoline Leavitt tweeted that Trump was calling Greenland a piece of ice because that was what it is And that the reporter who asked was the only one who had. Belafon January 21, 2026 at 3:55 pm @Archon: It takes 66 books to explain it. trollhattan January 21, 2026 at 3:56 pm Clintons’ letter got the expected response. IDC, it’s still a great letter. The House Oversight Committee voted to advance two resolutions to the House floor recommending that Bill and Hillary Clinton be found in contempt of Congress, The Hill reports. Both votes were bipartisan. The Bill Clinton resolution passed 34-8 and the Hillary Clinton resolution passed 28-15. Belafon January 21, 2026 at 3:57 pm @MazeDancer: Gotta love how they come up with rationale for his statements. Like his “Lowering by 1500%”, which they explained by saying that since the old price will be 1500% higher than the new price, then that’s how much it went down. Newspeak for the win. JML January 21, 2026 at 3:58 pm @MazeDancer: Prue will be missed. She was quite good on the show; she could be critical without being cruel and you have to respect her fondness for the boozy desserts. I didn’t realize she was 86! I wonder who they’ll get to replace her? Belafon January 21, 2026 at 3:58 pm @trollhattan: The next one will just say “I don’t have to. Republicans already set that precedent.” Baud January 21, 2026 at 3:59 pm @trollhattan: Well, that’s disappointing. So much for standing up to Republicans. Baud January 21, 2026 at 4:01 pm @Suzanne: Sorry I’m an outlier. I just don’t worry about party strategy. Belafon January 21, 2026 at 4:04 pm @Baud: Imagine living in a world where voters are all “I know the current party is evil, but I’m gonna stick with them because the other party hasn’t told me what they stand for.” Baud January 21, 2026 at 4:06 pm JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said Wednesday that the U.S. is “less reliable” as a global ally under President Trump, but he was otherwise reluctant to criticize Trump during his interview with The Economist at the World Economic Forum. Asked if he agrees with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney’s assessment that there’s been a “rupture in the world order,” Dimon rejected the binary question. “It’s not a rupture,” he said. “If you said to me, ‘has America become unreliable?’ No. It’s just, you had total reliance, and now it’s less reliable.” … Dimon’s most adamant disagreement with the Trump administration came when he was asked about the president’s recent proposal to impose a 10 percent cap on credit card interest rates. “It would be an economic disaster,” he said, noting that his company “would survive it” but “you have to have a drastic reduction of the credit card business. I mean drastic.” He added the move could remove credit from 80 percent of Americans. Suzanne January 21, 2026 at 4:07 pm @Baud: I’m a member of the Democratic Party. I can control what I do and how I vote. “Sees the threats presented by the Republican Party, a group of amoral billionaires and their bootlickers” is literally going to be my first criterion for deciding who I’m gonna vote for in the primary and to whom I’ll donate. IMO, understanding the full nature of the problem is the first step toward effectiveness. Old School January 21, 2026 at 4:08 pm @trollhattan: Both votes were bipartisan. Here are the details: Nine Democrats voted in favor of the Bill Clinton resolution: Reps. Maxwell Frost (Fla.), Raja Krishnamoorthi (Ill.), Summer Lee (Pa.), Stephen Lynch (Mass.), Ayanna Pressley (Mass.), Emily Randall (Wash.), Lateefah Simon (Calif.), Melanie Stansbury (N.M.) and Rashida Tlaib (Mich.). Three voted in favor of the Hillary Clinton measure: Lee, Stansbury and Tlaib. Baud January 21, 2026 at 4:11 pm @Belafon: I’m a partisan. I enjoy a strong speech and aggressive in-your-face action as much as anyone else. But I don’t stress about its absence, especially since I see enough examples of Dems doing it. I don’t need more. Baud January 21, 2026 at 4:14 pm @Suzanne: As far as I’m concerned, people still have moral freedom to vote however they wish in the primary. The general election is a different matter, not that I can enforce my morality on others. gene108 January 21, 2026 at 4:16 pm @trollhattan: From your link. Democrats are not going to do jackshit to stop the right-wing fascist take over of the country. Winning and crushing Republicans like a bug is what’s needed. Voting to hold two prominent Democrats in contempt means Democrats care more about norms and comity than crushing Republicans. Nine Democrats voted in favor of the Bill Clinton resolution: Reps. Maxwell Frost (Fla.), Raja Krishnamoorthi (Ill.), Summer Lee (Pa.), Stephen Lynch (Mass.), Ayanna Pressley (Mass.), Emily Randall (Wash.), Lateefah Simon (Calif.), Melanie Stansbury (N.M.) and Rashida Tlaib (Mich.). Three voted in favor of the Hillary Clinton measure: Lee, Stansbury and Tlaib. ”I am deeply troubled that the individuals who are the subject of today’s hearing did not appear on their scheduled date,” Rep. Melanie Stansbury (D-N.M.) said. “No one is above the law, but I do know based on the correspondence that they have been corresponding with you regularly to try to resolve this issue. But I don’t believe that’s what this hearing is actually about because if it was actually about getting justice and about getting the truth, we would have DOJ here. We would be holding Pam Bondi in contempt and we would be hearing from the survivors themselves.” Rep. Summer Lee (D-Pa.) introduced an amendment to hold Bondi in contempt for “failing to comply” with the law requiring the DOJ to release its Epstein files. It failed along party lines, 24-19. ETA: Democrats are too obsessed with processes than they are in getting their agenda through. Makes Democrats weak in the face of Republicans who will do almost anything to have their way. Baud January 21, 2026 at 4:18 pm @gene108: Yeah, that vote is more depressing than most of the things that gets under the Internet’s skin.

Matt McIrvin January 21, 2026 at 4:25 pm @gene108: Judging from the list of Democrats who voted for it, it looks to me less like a vote for norms and comity, and more like the left wing of the party getting to stick it to the Clintons. ArchTeryx January 21, 2026 at 4:26 pm @Archon: That removes agency from them I refuse to remove. MOST of them had a clear choice in the voting booth, away from all those malign influences. They still chose Trump. And a lot did not need any prodding from white men to do it. Baud January 21, 2026 at 4:26 pm @Matt McIrvin: That would be even worse.

They were kids during the 1990’s. They might not appreciate how good the U.S. was doing when Bill left office financially, and diplomatically. They’re the generation that’s supposed to be fighters. I think it’s only a matter of time before the right-wing fascist takeover of the U.S. happens. Right-wingers will refine their mistakes from Project 2025 and try again and again and again until they succeed. Any time Democrats control the federal government is just a delay for the inevitable. Democrats do not have enough of a ruthless streak to brake the ways Republicans have consolidated power from media consolidations to the SCOTUS to big tech. satby January 21, 2026 at 4:35 pm @Baud: and one of the few times I would agree with Matt Mc’s assessment. Geminid January 21, 2026 at 4:35 pm @ArchTeryx: Those seem like small, almost trivial majorities to me; less than 11 out of 20 as compared more than 9 out of that 20. So if one out of 20 White women were to switch sides, a majority of White women would have been in the right. Now, you could say this proves White women could have stopped Trump. But this is true of several other groups, my own most of all. So I don’t see the point in singling out White women as opposed to White men. They do not have some special obligation to vote Democratic, and neither do Black, Hispanic, Jewish, Muslim or LGBTQ people. And it’s patronizing to think otherwise, in my opinion. I think there is a notion that these groups owe their votes to Democrats because the Democratic Party has stood up for them. But they’ve all had to stand up for themselves plenty, and they have the right to vote as they see fit. It’s are our job to persuade them to vote for Democrats, and I think we do that job better if we don’t start out with the assumption that they owe us something on account of their demographic profile. And I think we do better as people when we look at others as individuals, and not as members of this group or that. That’s what we do when we start blaming groups for electoral outcomes. Now don’t get get me wrong; I’m as interested in cross-tabs, demographic shifts, etc. as the next person. But that’s in order to learn, not to blame. I think blaming is one of the most useless and self-defeating of all human activities. So is hating, but that’s a whole other story. ArchTeryx January 21, 2026 at 4:40 pm @Geminid: Where the crosstabs fail is separating the bigots from those that went along to go along. But that’s a topic that’s been discussed to death already here: How to reach Trump voters who may not have been necessarily bigots. My fundamental problem is when people vote their bigotry above all else. I’m not giving white males a pass. But most of them are ungettable at this point. They are totally invested in white supremacy, especially from my generation. Nothing, and nobody, is going to change that. They’re also not the ones being reduced to second class citizens and having their rights taken away, but vote for the face-eating leopards anyway. That’s a level of stupidity that I cannot abide any more. And it doesn’t matter whether you’re talking men or women. I’ve cut both out of my social circle after they voted in Trump 2.0. Bigots are bigots to me. Bokonon January 21, 2026 at 4:41 pm @gene108: They constantly humiliate themselves anytime they speak to the media or give a speech. They don’t care.

Trump goes from winning them 2% to winning them 7% after COVID hits? 7/2 is 3.5x. That’s a breathtaking level of stupidity. Fewer of them voted Trump in 2024 but not that many. People want to prove me a misogynist. Wrong. I don’t hate all women. But voting Trump was an act of supreme stupidity in 2020 and 2024. I’ve long ago come to the conclusion that men as a whole are absolutely bone-deep stupid. I expected better of women.

Bigots are bigots to me. As I have noted here before, most men, even white men, are far better served by Democratic presidents than Republicans. Working-class men, men on Social Security, men with disabilities, men in unions, men who needed student loans to go to college, men who need healthcare, gay and trans men. It’s not like white men who vote for Democrats are being selfless. Enlightened self-interest is still self-interest. Yet you seem to think that white women are the ones being irrational and stupid while giving white men a pass. That’s a whole stack of misogynist bullshit.

Another Scott January 21, 2026 at 5:11 pm @trollhattan: More from NPR.org: Democrats who opposed the contempt charges used Wednesday’s hearing to argue that the vote amounted to little more than political score settling. “It’s this subpoena only that Republicans and the chairman have been obsessed about putting all their energy behind,” said California Rep. Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the panel. For example, former U.S. attorneys general Eric Holder, Loretta Lynch, Jeff Sessions and Merrick Garland also did not appear after receiving subpoenas — and none of them has been held in contempt. Comer said that was because they submitted written testimony and did not recall any information relevant to the investigation. Garcia said the Clintons have turned over information to the committee, and offered alternatives to testify under a different format. Garcia urged Republicans to instead negotiate an interview with President Clinton, noting that he was willing to cooperate. Democrats also argued that Republicans are not serious about the Epstein probe, noting that the Department of Justice has failed to fully cooperate with a legal mandate to release its tranche of files from investigations into the late sex offender. “We all agree, we all want to hear from former President Bill Clinton,” said Rep. Maxwell Frost, D-Fla., said. “But committee Republicans have failed to conduct a serious investigation.” Comer wants some big, distracting, scalps. FWIW. Best wishes, Scott. prostratedragon January 21, 2026 at 5:13 pm @cwmoss: Despicable, he was.

White men, and ONLY white men, have never had their human rights questioned on this continent; so as people whose human rights have been plainly abrogated it’s disconcerting to see that group join in with the oppressor. I wish we could acknowledge this: that it’s not evil or insane for a white man to be attracted to the GOP and white male supremacy; that it is only natural for them to be drawn to it, and we should treasure those white men who specifically reject it. We celebrate alcoholics who give up the sauce; we need to celebrate those white men who give up the white supremacy.

I never excused white men; in fact, I specifically called them stupid for this crap. Would it make everyone feel better if I said women who voted Trump are every bit as stupid, short-sighted and blinkered as men who do it?

Karen Gail January 21, 2026 at 7:25 pm @Citizen Scientist: BREAKING: Newly revealed internal ICE memo shows how the Trump regime is illegally telling agents to violate the Constitution! If you needed any further proof that the US Constitution – the foundational governing document that every elected official swears to uphold when they take office – isn’t worth the paper it’s printed on since Donald Trump took office, the latest news from the trenches of the ICE invasion of American cities should be the most convincing proof. Indeed, Donald Trump’s mass deportation machine just crossed a chilling new line – and this time, it’s your front door that’s in the crosshairs. According to a bombshell Associated Press report, Immigration and Customs Enforcement is now asserting the power to forcibly enter private homes without a judge’s warrant, based solely on an internal memo quietly circulated inside the agency. No neutral judge. No constitutional check. Just a piece of ICE paperwork and a battering ram. For years, immigrant families were told a simple rule: Don’t open the door unless ICE shows a warrant signed by a judge. That advice was grounded in the Fourth Amendment — the same constitutional protection that keeps police from barging into your house on a whim. Now, Trump’s ICE says: Never mind. The internal memo, signed by ICE’s acting director Todd Lyons and dating back to May of 2025, authorizes officers to forcibly ram themselves into homes using only an administrative warrant – a document signed by ICE itself, not a court. “Although the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not historically relied on administrative warrants alone to arrest aliens subject to final orders of removal in their place of residence, the DHS Office of the General Counsel has recently determined that the U.S. Constitution, the Immigration and Nationality Act, and the immigration regulations do not prohibit relying on administrative warrants for this purpose,” the memo unilaterally, and illegally, declares Advocates say the policy shreds constitutional protections and reverses decades of legal guidance meant to prevent exactly this kind of abuse. And this isn’t theoretical. The AP personally witnessed ICE officers in Minneapolis smashing through the front door of a Liberian man’s home, rifles drawn, wearing tactical gear – without a judge’s warrant. Just raw force and bureaucratic arrogance. Even worse? A whistleblower complaint says the memo is being used to train new ICE recruits, while written training materials – the ones that still respect the Constitution – are being ignored. Some officers were allowed to read the memo only under supervision, forbidden from taking notes, and then ordered to hand it back. That’s not law enforcement – that’s secrecy bordering on authoritarianism. ICE claims everyone targeted already had “due process.” But the Fourth Amendment doesn’t vanish because someone has an immigration case. It protects everyone inside U.S. borders from unreasonable searches and seizures — full stop. This is what Trump’s immigration crackdown looks like in practice: Doors smashed. Families terrorized. Constitutional rights waved away by an internal memo no one was supposed to see. If federal agents can kick in the doors of immigrants without judicial oversight today, the precedent they’re setting won’t stop there tomorrow. That’s not border security. That’s government power running straight through the front door — Constitution be damned. gene108 January 21, 2026 at 7:30 pm @HopefullyNotCassandra: I read our so classy president claimed to strike a deal with NATO head Mark Rutte to “get” Greenland. My guess is that “deal” exists solely in his orange painted head. The U.S. already has deals to buildup our military presence in Greenland. We had a much larger troop presence there during the Cold War. American companies are able to get rights for mineral exploration. This is why Trump wanting annex Greenland is so coocoo bonkers. We can most of what the current administration wants by peaceful negotiations with Greenland and Denmark.

YY_Sima Qian January 21, 2026 at 8:21 pm What the hell happened to Lutnick?! By all accounts he ably & w/ compassion guided Cantor Fitzgerald through the near mass trauma of 9/11, when the company lost > 65% of its employees & Lutnick lost his younger brother, & took good care of the grieving families. I guess his “in group” is only a tiny slice of society. Interesting Name Goes Here January 21, 2026 at 8:22 pm @chemiclord: Given how most progressives with national name recognition tend to act, I can’t fault them for trying to find someone interested in doing more than collecting sound bites for their social media pages. I was willing to give Frost and Pressley the benefit of the doubt, but if they want to play the same chickenshit games Tlaib has made herself well known for, then I guess I don’t have much of a reason to take them seriously ever again. YY_Sima Qian January 21, 2026 at 8:34 pm @mrmoshpotato: Krishnamoorthi’s only notable role in the House has been Co-Chair for the House Select Committee on Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party, where he has largely been led by the nose by the Repub Co-Chair, from Mike Gallagher to Mike Moolenaar, in setting the agenda & the tone. The new Dem Co-Chair to the committee, Ro Khanna, has vowed not to allow this to happen in the name of bi-partisan comity to wage the Great Power Competition. SFAW January 21, 2026 at 9:09 pm @Omnes Omnibus: ​ Glad to be of service. RevRick January 21, 2026 at 11:10 pm @Jeffro: Lutnick is a typical shortsighted Republican hack. The US has plentiful supplies of cheap coal so all he cares about is peddling it to the world. He is the embodiment of Upton Sinclair’s observation that a man cannot understand something when their paycheck depends upon they’re not understanding it. Surveys show that 11% of the population buys Trump’s claim that climate change science is a hoax, and it’s not worth our breath arguing with them. About 65% are aware that climate change is a real threat, but they feel helpless in how to address it. And many of them are confused about how their votes are connected to addressing it. One thing is clear. Coal is the absolute worst fossil fuel when it comes to the environment. Not only does it produce carbon dioxide, but it also dumps heavy metals into the atmosphere and leaves toxic waste piles behind. But Lutnick doesn’t give a damn. He deserved far worse than the heckling he got.

Title: Palantir CEO says AI ‘will destroy’ this type of job while boosting vocational careers

Workers with college degrees in philosophy and other humanities will have a hard time finding jobs as artificial intelligence takes over the US economy, Palantir CEO Alex Karp cautioned Tuesday. Karp issued the warning after BlackRock CEO Larry Fink asked him if AI will “create jobs or destroy jobs overall” during a wide-ranging discussion at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. “It will destroy humanities jobs,” Karp replied. “[If] you went to an elite school and you studied philosophy — I’ll use myself as an example — hopefully you have some other skill. That one is going to be hard to market.” Karp, 58, is known for his unorthodox path to leading a top-tier tech company. He earned a a bachelor’s degree in philosophy from Haverford College, a JD from Stanford Law School and later a Ph.D. in philosophy from the prestigious Goethe University in Germany before cofounding Palantir alongside billionaire Peter Thiel in 2003. The Palantir boss did not point to specific fields that would face job losses, though graduates in the humanities often pursue careers in academia, law and government. When prodded by Fink, Karp said white collar jobs would likely see some upheaval as a result of AI, while vocational career paths that are typically categorized as blue collar will thrive. As an example, Karp pointed to vocational technicians who are building batteries and other components for tech companies. “If you’re a vocational technician … [they are] very valuable if not irreplaceable because we can make them into something different than what they were very rapidly. Those jobs are going to become more valuable,” Karp said. Overall, he believes there will be “more than enough jobs for the citizens of your nation, especially those with vocational training.” Employers, meanwhile, will need to develop “different ways of testing aptitude” beyond academic degrees to get the most out of their workers. During the Davos discussion, Karp and Fink agreed that an education in the humanities was already “hard to market” even before AI reshaped the economy. “It was hard to market. Very hard,” Karp said. “It’s a very, very strong education. If you can get a job, you might keep it. That’s what I always thought, if I finally get a job, I’ll probably keep it and do well, but I’m not sure who’s going to give me my first job.” A number of tech executives have previously warned that AI will result in job losses, especially in white-collar fields. Last May, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei warned of potential mass layoffs in fields like tech, finance and law that could push national unemployment to 20%. As The Post reported in December, Karp, who has described himself as neurodivergent, recently announced that Palantir would offer a new fellowship program specifically crafted for neurodivergent talent. The program was announced shortly after Karp faced social media snark after he was seen fidgeting in his chair and waving his arms throughout an interview with journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin during the New York Times’ DealBook Summit.

Title: Globalization has ‘failed’ the US – commerce secretary

Globalization is a “failed policy” that has “left America behind,” US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick declared in Davos on Tuesday, accusing the World Economic Forum (WEF) of pushing a globalist agenda that undermines the West. “The Trump administration and myself, we are here to make a very clear point: globalization has failed the West and the United States of America,” Lutnick told attendees, before turning on the organizers of the summit. “It’s a failed policy. It is what the WEF has stood for, which is export, offshore, far-shore, find the cheapest labor in the world and the world is a better place for it,” he said. “The fact is it has left America behind. It has left the American workers behind. And what we are here to say is ‘America First’ is a different model, one that we encourage other countries to consider.” US President Donald Trump railed against globalization during all three of his presidential campaigns, and at high-profile gatherings like Davos. Vowing to re-industrialize the US and use tariffs to stop the flow of jobs to foreign countries, he promised in 2016 that he would “no longer surrender this country or its people to the false song of globalism.” Ten years later, Trump’s program of economic nationalism has strained relations with US allies. Trump threatened eight European NATO member states with 10% tariffs last week, over their opposition to his planned annexation of Greenland, prompting the EU to halt ratification of a landmark trade deal with the US and threaten retaliatory tariffs of his own. Trump’s allies have also gone ahead and forged deals with the US’ chief economic rival, China. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney inked a preliminary trade deal with Beijing last week, describing the agreement as the beginning of “a new strategic partnership” between both countries. French President Emmanuel Macron, who has led the charge in pressing the EU to impose retaliatory levies on the US, called on Tuesday for “more Chinese direct investment in Europe, particularly in critical sectors.” Globalization has FAILED.

It’s a failed policy… and it has left America behind.”America is… pic.twitter.com/Urxl7pZwSe During his speech on Tuesday, Lutnick warned that the EU’s commitment to net zero carbon emissions by 2030 would make the bloc “subservient to China,” as wind and solar energy requires Chinese-made batteries.Lutnick caused commotion at a dinner hosted by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink later on Tuesday evening. According to multiple media reports, the secretary delivered another anti-Europe speech that led to European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde walking out and the dinner being canceled before dessert.

January 21, 2026 13:09 ET | Source: OGBC OGBC Singapore City, SINGAPORE, Jan. 21, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- OGBC Group, a Singapore-headquartered innovation hub and investment group, today announced the completion of its Series C preferred equity investment in PsiQuantum, Corp., a quantum computing company developing utility-scale, fault-tolerant quantum systems. OGBC Group is a Singapore-headquartered innovation and investment organization focused on frontier technologies Through this investment, OGBC joins a distinguished group of global institutional backers—including the Australian Federal and Queensland Governments, NVIDIA (via NVentures), Temasek, and leading asset managers such as BlackRock and Baillie Gifford—further strengthening PsiQuantum’s long-term capital base. The investment was made through OGBC Premier PQ Fund, reflecting OGBC’s focus on foundational technologies with long-term global impact. Strategic Alignment in Deep Technology Quantum computing is increasingly viewed as a source of durable strategic advantage. This is not only due to step-change improvements in computational capability, but also through control of scarce quantum resources, proprietary problem encodings, and emerging protocol layers that may define access and interoperability across future systems. NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang has described the sector as “reaching an inflection point,” a view shared by many industry participants as quantum technologies move closer to large-scale deployment. “At OGBC Group, we focus on aligning long-term capital with companies pioneering breakthrough technologies that have the potential to redefine industries,” said Jayden Wei, Managing Partner and Chairman of OGBC. “PsiQuantum represents a rare convergence of scientific rigor and industrial-scale execution. Joining this investor group alongside NVIDIA and Temasek reflects our conviction that quantum computing will serve as foundational infrastructure for the next era of global computation.” From a research perspective, frameworks such as John Preskill’s "Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ)" model suggest that early commercial value is likely to emerge from hybrid quantum–classical workflows, well before the arrival of fully fault-tolerant systems. These approaches are expected to complement existing AI infrastructure by addressing structural constraints such as compute scarcity, data fragmentation, and productivity limitations through new forms of optimization and simulation.PsiQuantum’s differentiation lies in its ability to leverage existing semiconductor manufacturing to build a million-qubit, fault-tolerant system. This focus on scalability from inception is designed to deliver a commercially viable quantum advantage, moving the technology from experimental labs to real-world industrial applications. About OGBC Premier OGBC Premier back frontier technologies with disciplined capital, global reach, partnership mindset, and long‑term value — from quantum and AI compute to advanced semiconductors, biotech and programmable financial infrastructure. OGBC Group OGBC Group is a builder-first innovation and investment hub that brings together capital, technology, and culture. Headquartered in Singapore with regional presence across Asia, OGBC supports founders and operators across the digital economy through high-signal events, ecosystem programs, and strategic investments.

Title: Bitcoin and Crypto Entering ‘Existential Crisis’ As DeFi Moves From Niche Experiment To Wall Street: Arca CIO

The chief investment officer at a digital asset investment firm is raising new questions over the future of crypto for one key reason. Arca CIO Jeff Dorman says he believes Bitcoin (BTC) and many other digital assets are unlikely to see values increase from the explosion in the tokenization of assets. Dorman warns there may only be a few beneficiaries from the latest big trend in blockchain use cases such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) plan to launch a tokenized securities platform for 24/7 trading and stablecoin-based funding. Says Dorman, “Crypto really in an existential crisis now. Everything we thought would happen on blockchain is now happening, but little if any of the value accrues to any stocks or tokens in our ecosystem. Fat protocol thesis is long dead. BTC has nothing to do with ANY of the actual blockchain growth engines: no exposure to growth of stablecoins, decentralized finance (DeFi) or real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. Continue to think a handful of DeFi tokens, token launchpad companies, and GLXY [Galaxy Digital] stock are the only clear winners from this trend – when all assets are on on-chain, DeFi goes from niche experiment to the full financial plumbing engine.” However, macro analyst and institutional crypto veteran Dan Tapiero disagrees with Dorman. “Remarkable how wrong this is.” In response to Tapiero’s criticism, Dorman double downs on his view. “Where do you see value accruing from all of the newfound use cases of blockchain? We’re seeing lots of tokenization and heavy adoption of stables and the value is accruing to intermediaries like BlackRock, Securitize and Tether.” Bitcoin is trading for $88,992 at time of writing, down 1.9% in the last 24 hours.
