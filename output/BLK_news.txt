Guggenheim Treasury Securities (GTS), a subsidiary of financial consulting firm Guggenheim Capital, has issued $20 million worth of Digital Commercial Paper (DCP) on Ethereum. The DCP received a P-1 credit rating from Moody’s. According to a Sept. 26 statement, Guggenheim will issue the paper via a blockchain platform developed by Zeconomy called AmpFi.Digital, which offers tokenization services for qualified investors. Zeconomy CEO Giacinto Cosenza stated: “With tens of billions of dollars locked in DeFi and corporate treasuries, we are thrilled to partner with GTS to address a clear need for more trusted and secure blockchain solutions.” The move comes as the tokenized US treasuries market surpassed $2 billion in market cap, with the participation of traditional finance heavyweights such as asset managers BlackRock and Franklin Templeton. BlackRock’s tokenized fund BUIDL has a market cap of over $513 million, while Franklin Templeton’s FOBXX trails close with $435 million. Additionally, AmpFi.Digital stated in the announcement that it aims to address key decentralized finance (DeFi) challenges such as poor credit quality, high fees, and compliance issues. Cosenza added that the approval of crypto exchange-traded funds (ETF) in the US and the substantial growth in the tokenization market this year highlighted institutional demand for crypto. Notably, nearly $1.6 billion of all tokenized U.S. treasuries are issued using Ethereum as an infrastructure. In addition to BlackRock’s BUIDL, Ondo’s USDY and OUSG and Hashnote’s USYC significantly increase the blockchain’s participation in the tokenized government securities ecosystem. Moreover, CoinDesk reported on Sept. 25 that Visa plans to create a platform that will help institutional firms issue fiat-backed tokens. Ethereum’s infrastructure will also power the Visa Tokenized Asset Platform (VTAP). Solana holds just 5.5% of the tokenized US government securities market as of Sept. 26, with $122.7 million in tokens issued on the network. However, Franklin Templeton and Citigroup recently announced they are eyeing Solana for their next financial products exploring blockchain technology. During Solana’s ecosystem-focused event Breakpoint, Franklin Templeton revealed its plans to launch a mutual fund natively on Solana. Meanwhile, Citi is considering tapping the network for money programmability through smart contracts aimed at cross-border payments.

The SEC Chair will "certainly" not maintain his role under a Trump government, but a Harris presidency might also end his term. Howard Lutnick claimed that regulators have "no idea what they are talking about" when is comes to define crypto. The FBI affidavit reveals that Iza allegedly used fake warrants and intimidation tactics to exploit his victims. Despite breaking the $65,000 area this afternoon, Bitcoin still needs to hold its price above it to confirm the bullish sentiment. SEC Chair Gary Gensler reaffirms Bitcoin's non-security status while criticizing industry non-compliance amid SEC scrutiny. Analysts highlight the convergence of Bitcoin and altcoin momentum as a promising sign for broader market recovery. A decline in Solana DeFi ecosystem incentives is likely driving the fall of PayPal's stablecoin from $1 billion to $712 million market cap.

Title: Why Solana Is Poised To Smash $330 Price Milestone And Capture 50% Of Ether’s Market Cap
URL: https://zycrypto.com/why-solana-is-poised-to-smash-330-price-milestone-and-capture-50-of-ethers-market-cap/
Time Published: 2024-09-26T21:33:41Z
Full Content:
According to data from CoinGecko, among the top ten major cryptocurrencies by market value, Solana (SOL) has registered considerable gains over the past seven days (7.5%), even surpassing Bitcoin’s 1.8% growth. According to VanEck, at press time, SOL is trading for $155 and appears ready to extend its bullish momentum to hit $330 and reach 50% of Ether’s market capitalization. In a Sept. 25 report, VanEck’s research department, MarketVector, noted that Solana has beaten Ethereum in several important areas. For instance, the report’s authors observed that Solana has a high throughput and can process thousands of transactions per second, which is roughly 3,000% higher than Ethereum’s TPS. Moreover, Solana boasts 1,300% more daily active users than Ether, and its transaction fees are “5 million percent cheaper”, making it a more efficient and scalable network. The report highlights decentralized finance (DeFi), stablecoins, and payments as key areas where Solana can challenge Ethereum. Solana’s ability to transcend Ethereum in terms of speed and costs gives it an edge in the fast-growing sector. “Another major use-case is lending and borrowing within the DeFi space, a sector expected to continue growing at a rapid pace. Payments and remittances also hold massive potential, especially with Solana’s lower fees and faster transaction times. If institutions and everyday users can save money through cheaper, faster transactions, Solana’s user base could grow even more rapidly”, VanEck stated. The authors wonder why we haven’t yet witnessed a massive exodus toward Solana from Ethereum, particularly from institutions, despite these impressive SOL statistics. In terms of institutional adoption, Solana trails behind its older rival, which won further validation in July this year when United States regulators gave the nod to nine spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Although demand for these ETH instruments is rather lackluster, the approval indicates that institutional investors now have more appetite for ether. The landscape around a U.S.-listed spot Solana ETF, remains in limbo. While other countries, like Brazil, have already greenlighted such products, BlackRock execs recently asserted that “it will be a while before we see” a SOL ETF in America. Nonetheless, the VanEck analysts observed that retail investors are “slowly waking up” to Solana’s potential to challenge Ethereum’s status as the smart contracts king. VanEck further pointed out that Solana’s market cap remains only 22% of Ethereum’s. The report attributes this huge gap to Ether’s first-mover advantage and the wider institutional trust brought on by the ETFs. However, the researchers believe these advantages won’t guarantee Ethereum’s reign forever. Solana should focus on its strengths to ultimately close this wide gap. Meanwhile, the report suggested that Solana is grossly undervalued owing to its technical achievements and could potentially reach 50% of Ethereum’s market cap. Should this materialize, the price of SOL could rocket to $330, given ETH’s present price and market cap of $2,635 and $315 billion, respectively.

Season of Discovery Phase 5 allows players to venture into the Blackwing Lair and Zul’Gurub raid dungeons, collect new Tier 2 armor sets, and more— all waiting for you to discover. In the dark recesses of the mountain's peak, Nefarian, the eldest son of Deathwing, conducts some of his most awful experimentation, controlling mighty beings like puppets and combining the eggs of different dragonflights with horrific results. Should he prove successful, even darker pursuits rest on the horizon. Step into Blackwing Lair as a reimagined 20-40 player raid dungeon with a host of new mechanics including a swappable difficulty system allowing you to engage in greater challenges by activating new raid-wide effects based on each of the five dragonflight’s unique abilities. Leave no raider behind. Tuned as a 20-player encounter, players can bring additional friends to the adventure, with up to 40 players! As you make your way through the depths of the lair, keep a sharp eye out for some additional drops and their rewarding discoveries. Similar to Tier 1 sets from the Molten Core raid, Tier 2 armor sets are expanding to include multiple variations for different talent specializations and playstyles. The alternate versions of these new Tier 2 sets have new appearances and increased stats from the previous version of the Tier 2 sets and utilize Tier 1 set bonuses. This allows players more options to choose from when selecting the gear they would like to use while fine-tuning their playstyle. Players can also exchange Firelands Embers from the Blackrock Eruption event by visiting with Lokthos Darkbargainer in Blackrock Depths for elemental essences. Pix Xizzix now has additional new items such as Tier 2 bracer tokens for all classes available to purchase along with relics for druids, paladins, and shaman. Deep within the jungles of Stranglethorn, an ancient troll city full of untold peril awaits. Do you have what it takes to delve into its mysteries? Assemble a band of hardy explorers and make your way to Zul’Gurub, a max-level, up to 20-player raid instance with many epic items to procure from its verdant tree-lined avenues and lost temples. Zul’Gurub invites 10-20 players into this raid dungeon. Rewards and difficulty are tuned for 10, with room for 20 to join in the hunt for treasures untold. Players will be able to earn updated and redesigned rewards. Hakkar also offers new encounter mechanics and rewards for defeating him while all Zandalari Priests alive. Defeating Zandalari Priests now also grants access to buffs from powerful loa spirits like Hethiss and Shirvallah. Players will need to figure out the best route through Zul’Gurub to maximize the the effectiveness of these powerful spells. Players may also manually choose which boss they would like to face in the Edge of Madness Encounter. To fight a specific boss, click on their specific tablet and activate the brazier with Gurubashi Mojo Madness while the aura is active. In Season of Discovery Phase 5, many rune abilities have their discoveries streamlined to allow players to more easily complete those discoveries and obtain their runes. Pix Xizzix in Booty Bay now also makes bind-on-account tokens available for characters who have finished certain shared discoveries such as the Dark Riders, Wild Gods, Ley Lines, or Illari Duskfeather. Simply purchase the relevant emblem and mail it to an alt character to redeem at a special Rune Broker in Stormwind and Orgrimmar for their appropriate class rune. We have more discoveries for you to make in Phase 5, including new class-specific items for every class to find. For now, our lips are sealed on more details. The new phase ushers in additional Honor updates along with an increase to PvP ranks over time beginning with the release of Phase 5, allowing characters to continue earning ranks above rank 10, to a new cap of 13. Players earn more honor in battlegrounds along with gaining more honor with Marks of Honor turn-ins, and will earn slightly more Marks of Honor from losses in Warsong Gulch and Arathi basin. Queue restrictions for Warsong Gulch and Arathi Basin are also removed, so that players can get into these battlegrounds faster. Season of Discovery Phase 5 adds a few other surprises in the form of a new raid boss and new dungeon boss, complete with all new loot! We look forward to seeing you engage with these new encounters. Good luck and may your blades never dull and your mana bar be plentiful!

Title: Bitcoin Peaks At Highest Value In 2 Months Above $65,000: Bull Run Predictions
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-peaks-at-highest-value-in-2-months-above-65000-bull-run-predictions/
Time Published: 2024-09-26T19:00:09Z
Full Content:
For the first time in nearly two months, Bitcoin (BTC) has surpassed the $65,000 mark, marking a significant recovery following two notable downturns in August and September. During these crashes, Bitcoin experienced a steep decline of 20% on two separate occasions, specifically on August 5 and September 6. However, as October approaches—a month often associated with a bullish resurgence for Bitcoin—market predictions are increasingly optimistic, suggesting that the cryptocurrency might be gearing up for another major uptrend. On Thursday, Bitcoin recorded a 3% increase within a 24-hour period, reaching a price of $65,500. This upward movement has sparked discussions among analysts about whether this signals the start of a parabolic bull run. Crypto investor Scott Melker expressed this sentiment, emphasizing that Bitcoin is currently attempting to establish its first higher high since peaking at $74,000 in March of this year. Melker noted that closing above $65,000 would confirm a new upward trend, transitioning from the lows of $50,000 observed in August. This pattern—a low, high, higher low, and higher high—suggests a bullish market structure replacing the previous bearish trends. Historically, October has been a strong month for Bitcoin, with analysts like Lark Davis pointing out that the average return during this month is approximately 22.90%. If Bitcoin were to experience a similar increase this year, it could potentially rise to around $79,000, surpassing its previous all-time high and overcoming key resistance levels. Such a move would set the stage for a powerful rally into November according to Davis’ analysis. In a further analysis, Rekt Capital provided insights into Bitcoin’s recent performance. He noted that September, often viewed negatively, turned out to be the best September for Bitcoin on record, with a 9% increase. Rekt also highlighted historical patterns related to Bitcoin’s Halving cycles, indicating that Bitcoin typically breaks out from its re-accumulation range approximately 154 to 163 days post-Halving. Currently, Bitcoin is 159 days past its last Halving that took place in April of this year. Based on previous cycles, Rekt believes that this timing suggests that a breakout could be imminent, reinforcing the idea that Bitcoin is well-positioned for significant gains in the near future. The current resurgence can be attributed to the US Federal Reserve’s (Fed’s) dovish stance and recent 0.50% basis point (bps) interest rate cut on September 18, which was seen as a notable bullish catalyst not only for BTC but also for the broader market, which has followed Bitcoin’s performance to the upside in recent days. In addition, last week saw a resumption of inflows into the Bitcoin ETF market, following steady outflows throughout August and early September. For instance, US spot Bitcoin ETFs had a total net inflow of $106 million on Wednesday, continuing their net inflows for 5 consecutive days. BlackRock’s IBIT ETF had an inflow of $184 million. Overall, there seems to be a combination of bullish catalysts in place for the market’s largest cryptocurrency to continue its recovery, with massive gains expected in the last half of the year and early 2025.

Full Content:
Saba Capital Management, L.P., a significant shareholder in BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Innovation & Growth Term Trust (NYSE:BIGZ), has recently increased its stake in the company with the purchase of additional shares valued at over $312,000. The investment firm, known for its active management in closed-end funds, executed the buy transactions on September 24 and 25, according to a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The transactions involved the purchase of 9,482 shares at a price of $7.54 each, followed by an additional 31,988 shares at $7.52 per share. This price range reflects Saba Capital's continued confidence in the BlackRock-managed trust, which focuses on innovation and growth opportunities. Following these purchases, Saba Capital Management's holdings in BlackRock Innovation & Growth Term Trust have risen significantly. The firm's investment moves are closely watched by market participants, as Saba Capital is recognized for its strategic positions in the market. BlackRock Innovation & Growth Term Trust, trading under the symbol NYSE:BIGZ, is a term trust that aims to provide growth and income to its investors by investing in a portfolio of equity securities. The trust's performance and management strategies have attracted the attention of institutional investors like Saba Capital Management. Investors and market observers often look to the buying and selling activities of major shareholders for insights into a stock's potential direction. The recent purchases by Saba Capital Management could be interpreted as a positive signal for the trust's future performance. The disclosure of these transactions provides transparency and allows investors to make informed decisions based on the actions of significant shareholders. As BlackRock Innovation & Growth Term Trust continues to operate within the dynamic innovation sector, the investment decisions of firms like Saba Capital Management will remain under scrutiny for indications of market trends and confidence levels. In the wake of Saba Capital Management's increased stake in BlackRock Innovation & Growth Term Trust (NYSE:BIGZ), it's noteworthy to examine some key financial metrics and insights from InvestingPro that could shed light on the company's current market position and future prospects. With a market capitalization of $1.7 billion, BIGZ appears to be a sizeable player in the trust space. An attractive feature for investors is the trust's substantial dividend yield, which stands at 13.85% as of the last recorded date, indicating a strong commitment to returning value to shareholders. The trust's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is currently at 7.87, which may suggest that the stock is undervalued compared to industry peers, especially when coupled with a high dividend yield. This could be part of the rationale behind Saba Capital Management's recent share purchases. Additionally, the trust's performance over various time frames presents a mixed picture, with a one-week total return of -1.45%, but a more positive one-year total return of 23.71%, reflecting longer-term investor confidence. InvestingPro Tips for BIGZ indicate that while the trust pays a significant dividend to shareholders, it also suffers from weak gross profit margins and a valuation that implies a poor free cash flow yield. These insights might be particularly relevant for investors looking to balance the immediate income generation potential with the long-term financial health of the trust. For those interested in a deeper analysis, there are additional InvestingPro Tips available for BIGZ, which can be accessed for further strategic investment considerations. The comprehensive tips on InvestingPro could provide valuable context for understanding both the opportunities and risks associated with investing in BIGZ.

Title: Ethena debuts UStb stablecoin backed by BlackRock to complement USDe
URL: https://cryptobriefing.com/ethena-labs-ustb-stablecoin/
Time Published: 2024-09-26T18:17:39Z
Full Content:
Share this article Ethena Labs, the startup behind the synthetic USDe dollar, has announced a new stablecoin called UStb that will be fully backed by BlackRock’s on-chain BUIDL fund. The move expands Ethena’s stablecoin offerings and aims to provide additional stability options for users and exchange partners. https://x.com/ethena_labs/status/1839259051030630757 UStb will function similarly to traditional stablecoins, with its reserves invested in BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL). The BUIDL fund itself holds US dollars, US Treasury bills, and repurchase agreements, providing a stable backing for the new stablecoin. According to Ethena, UStb will exist as an independent product with a different risk profile compared to USDe. While USDe is a synthetic stablecoin that maintains its $1 peg through cash-and-carry arbitrage, UStb aims to offer a more traditional stablecoin structure backed by real-world assets. The company stated that UStb can support USDe during challenging market conditions. Ethena’s governance structure allows for the reallocation of backing assets from USDe to UStb when needed, potentially mitigating risks associated with negative funding rates. “UStb can also help USDe better weather difficult market conditions,” Ethena Labs claimed in a press release. “During periods of negative funding, the company can close hedging positions underlying USDe and reallocate its reserve assets to UStb.” Ethena plans to list UStb on centralized exchanges like Bybit and Bitget, where USDe is already used as margin collateral. The addition of UStb will provide exchange partners with a choice between two distinct products for margin collateral, potentially broadening the adoption of Ethena’s stablecoin solutions. Following the announcement, Ethena Labs’ ENA governance token experienced a significant price surge. Over the past 24 hours, ENA’s price increased by approximately 14%, climbing from $0.307 to $0.378. Trading volume also saw a notable uptick, reaching around $196.1 million. However, the market capitalization of USDe, Ethena’s flagship product, saw a slight decline of $13 million to $2.54 billion on the day of the announcement. This decrease comes after USDe had previously surpassed $3 billion in market cap in June. The introduction of UStb represents Ethena’s continued efforts to innovate in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. The company aims to transform Ethereum into a crypto-native yield-bearing stablecoin ecosystem that operates independently of the traditional banking system. Ethena’s approach involves leveraging delta-neutral strategies, on-chain custody, and derivatives to manage volatility and improve scalability and stability. The addition of UStb to its product lineup demonstrates the company’s commitment to providing diverse stablecoin options for users and exchange partners in varying market conditions. Earlier this month, Ethena suffered a frontend attack, although its team has confirmed that no funds were harmed or stolen, with the damage limited to its user interface.

© 2024 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy Paul Singer’s Elliott Management, a hedge fund known for its aggressive activist tactics, is diving deep into office real estate, going into contract for $450 million to buy an office tower in Miami’s financial district, Bloomberg reported. The building, 701 Brickell, is home to some of the biggest names in finance, including Apollo Global Management, BlackRock and Point72 Asset Management. Last year, Pura Vida, a popular fast-casual chain, opened a 5,000-square-foot cafe on the ground floor. In April, Nuveen Real Estate put 701 Brickell up for sale, seeking $500 million. JLL is brokering the sale of the 32-story high-rise. The New York-based investor purchased the 1.1 million-square-foot tower for $172 million in 2002, according to property records. If the deal closes, it would mark Miami’s largest office sale this year. In 2023, Nuveen sold 801 Brickell, a nearby office property, for $250 million. Elliott Management, which moved its headquarters from New York to West Palm Beach in 2020, has been making inroads in Miami real estate this year. The firm and Adi Chugh launched Tyko Capital, which has emerged as one of the city’s largest lenders in recent months, providing $565 million to refinance the 830 Brickell office building and $527 million to build the St. Regis-branded luxury condo complex, also in Brickell. The district’s office asking rents — which average $93.73 per square foot, the highest in Miami-Dade County — have jumped since the pandemic hit, thanks to a slew of high-profile, new-to-market companies that set up shop. Asking rents also got a boost from the arrival of 830 Brickell, which is nearing completion and set a new benchmark for rates. Representatives for Nuveen and Elliott Management did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Julia Echikson can be reached at jechikson@commercialobserver.com.

Bitcoin options interest "has been building mostly around the round figure of $100,000," Geoffrey Kendrick, head of crypto research at Standard Chartered, wrote in an emailed comments. "Notably the build out has come at a more rapid pace than can be explained just by the fact that bitcoin prices are higher. Indeed the jump in open interest at the $100,000 strike that has come this week indicates something else is driving participants." The bitcoin price rally comes after U.S. vice president and 2024 Democratic Party nominee Kamala Harris said that if she wins the White House in November, she would "encourage innovative technologies like AI and digital assets while protecting our consumers and investors," according to a Bloomberg report of a Wall Street fundraiser. "The most likely, from a timing perspective, is vice president Harris' comments on Sunday where she said she would encourage crypto businesses. These comments suggest either outcome on 5 November will end up being bitcoin positive," Kendrick wrote, pointing to the bitcoin and crypto market leading "the pack in terms of performance for the first time in a while" following the Fed's historical interest rate cut last week as evidence of growing positive sentiment. Kendrick has predicted the bitcoin price will surge to $125,000 per bitcoin if former U.S. president Donald Trump wins the election but will still climb to $75,000 if Harris wins. Trump has fully embraced bitcoin and crypto this year, promising to create a U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve if he's elected and backing his a crypto project led by his sons Don Jr and Eric.

Harris' muted endorsement of crypto failed to spur much support from the crypto community, with Galaxy Research's Alex Thorne posting to X that he doesn't "see any material difference from Harris (or her advisor Brian Nelson a few weeks ago) that offers cause for celebration."

Title: Aid to Ukraine is Hurting Europe. Irresponsible Pro-Ukrainian EU Trade Policy Destroying Bulgarian Agribusiness. European Farmers Going Bankrupt
URL: https://www.globalresearch.ca/pro-ukrainian-trade-policy-destroying-bulgarian-agribusiness/5868745
Time Published: 2024-09-26T16:05:25Z

The irresponsible policy of aid to Ukraine is hurting Europe in every possible way. It is not only the arms shipments that are causing harm to EU nations, but also the current trade rules that prioritize Ukrainian products in order to expand “economic cooperation” with Kiev. Farmers’ dissatisfaction is only going to get worse and worse, paving the way for a major crisis in the future. Bulgaria has begun to show its dissatisfaction with the EU’s pro-Ukrainian trade policies. The country’s government has asked the European Commission to adopt a new resolution proposing to ban Ukrainian chicken eggs from the European market. The measure is intended to protect the European market from cheap Ukrainian products, ensuring the participation of native farmers in the commercial competition. Bulgarian Agriculture Minister Georgi Tahov said during a meeting with the EU Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Brussels that Bulgarian farmers are having severe difficulties competing with Ukrainian products, as the latter have “invaded” the European market at low prices and in massive quantities. This not only jeopardizes the economic stability of the Bulgarian agricultural sector, but also threatens to bankrupt thousands of farmers, leading to unemployment and social crises. Ukrainian eggs are causing controversy and are a particularly sensitive topic in the current European scenario. Egg production is one of the main activities of Bulgarian farmers, who have always had strong support from the state and the local market to maintain stable production levels. However, since the beginning of the special military operation, the EU has adopted an irresponsible policy of easy import of Ukrainian products with the alleged aim of boosting Kiev’s economy. As a result, Ukrainian eggs, which are 30% cheaper than Bulgarian ones, have simply “invaded” the European market. Ukraine exported more than 2,600 tons of eggs in the first half of 2024 alone. This figure is already five times higher than in the corresponding period last year, and an even greater rise is expected for the coming months. As a result, Bulgarian poultry producers are going bankrupt, and a big number of farmers are abandoning their activities due to lack of profit. “[This situation] puts serious pressure on prices on the domestic market (…) We firmly support the people of Ukraine, but this should in no way cause bankruptcies and violate the rights of our farmers,” the Bulgarian minister said. This is not the first time that demands have been made for changes in European import policy for Ukrainian goods. Since 2022, there has been strong pressure from European farmers to review the rules that facilitate the purchase of Ukrainian food products. Just as the Bulgarian egg sector is being affected, producers of grains, meat, milk and other items are going bankrupt in several European countries. The crisis affects countries from the most eastern areas, such as Poland and Bulgaria, to the most Western, such as the Netherlands, Germany and France. Farmers across the entire European continent are suffering from the EU’s irresponsible attitude of favoring Ukraine. The strong protests by farmers have led to expectations of changes in the trade situation. A report published by the Financial Times in June predicted that the bloc would resume tax obligations on Ukrainian products. However, the current tax exemption rules will remain in place until at least the second half of next year – which is enough time to bankrupt thousands of European farmers. In the same vein, it is unlikely that the European Commission will approve the Bulgarian request, given that most European officials are currently in favor of maintaining all policies supporting Ukraine, no matter how irresponsible they are. For the EU, the impact of anti-Russian and pro-Ukrainian policies on European citizens is not important. The only thing that really matters is maintaining the levels of aid to Kiev, regardless of the consequences. It must also be emphasized that this process is a real “ticking timebomb” for the entire European food stability. While European farmers are going bankrupt to favor Ukrainian agribusiness, Ukrainian arable land itself is being handed over to Western private investment funds, such as Blackrock, as a method of payment for NATO’s billion-dollar support. In a few years, Europe will not be able to count on either its own production or Ukrainian products, entering a major supply crisis and dependence on imports – while having to impose sanctions that limit imports. Consciously or not, EU decision-makers are creating a problem that will not be solved so easily. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article to your friends and colleagues.

Title: Solana And Ethereum: How These Cryptocurrencies Stack Up In 2024
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/amorsexton/2024/09/26/solana-and-ethereum-how-these-cryptocurrencies-stack-up-in-2024/
Time Published: 2024-09-26T15:24:04Z
Full Content:
Solana and Ethereum: How These Cryptocurrencies Stack Up In 2024, Part 1 In 2008, Bitcoin Bitcoin was introduced as the world's first provably secure peer-to-peer cryptocurrency. Ethereum Ethereum , announced in 2014, built on Bitcoin’s vision by allowing developers to create their own decentralized applications on a blockchain. Solana Solana , conceived in 2017, was built to address Web3’s scalability challenges, enabling high throughput and low-latency transaction processing at scale. Both Etheruem and Solana have been built to solve problems faced by the previous generation of blockchain technology. Both have also gone from zero to one in bringing new infrastructure to market, unlocking novel use cases, and driving adoption across Main Street and Wall Street alike. But how does one protocol compare to the other in 2024? Today, let’s look at how Ethereum and Solana stack up across three categories: institutional adoption, scalability, and liquidity. Institutional Adoption In 2024, institutional adoption has been driven in part by newly introduced crypto exchange traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S, providing a regulated and accessible way for investors to add digital assets to their portfolios. Most recently, Ethereum ETFs began trading on July 23, 2024, with funds from major institutions such as Blackrock and Grayscale. This followed the successful launch of eleven Bitcoin ETFs in January, after approval by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). By August, BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust was the first to surpass $1 billion in net inflows. The debut of both Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs has paved the way for a potential Solana ETF. Solana ETFs are not currently listed in the U.S., although they are available in some international markets. There are, however, applications under review by the SEC, with VanEck being the first American company to file for a U.S. Solana ETF, and 21Shares also submitting an application. It has been reported that the SEC rejected the 19b-4 filings submitted by Cboe BZX on behalf of the two institutions, raising a question around the deadline for an ultimate decision on a Solana ETF. Staking is notably excluded from Ethereum ETFs, leading some to believe a Solana ETF would follow suit, Solana also being a Proof of Stake blockchain. If so, this would indirectly transfer value to those who stake both SOL and ETH through each respective protocol’s inflation rate, meaning those who self-stake or choose to stake with a third party would receive more value from their staking. Scalability Both Ethereum and Solana pursue a vastly different, yet equally ambitious, scalability roadmap. Today, the Ethereum network faces throughput limits, with transactions ranging from 15-30 per second (TPS). These transactions are bundled into blocks, which are then processed by validators. Ethereum scalability relies on a strong Layer 2 (L2) ecosystem, a roadmap it has pursued since 2020. In March 2024, Ethereum’s Dencun upgrade was launched, introducing proto danksharding and dramatically reducing fees for L2s. These L2s, such as Optimism Optimism and Arbitrum Arbitrum , are separate blockchains, fully compatible with Ethereum, that take transaction load off the main network. L2 solutions have grown in popularity due to their high speeds and low fees, with institutions, such as Kraken, Sony, and Coinbase, as notable examples looking towards L2s for a number of use cases. Solana is faster than Ethereum, with a theoretical max of 65,000 transactions per second (TPS), and it aims to be even quicker. Yet historically, Solana’s mainnet has had to overcome some uptime challenges. Firedancer, a Solana validator client built by Jump Trading, aims to deliver up to a theoretical TPS that is orders of magnitude higher, while improving reliability. Built from the ground up, Firedancer uses a concurrency model, borrowed from the low latency trading space, with high performance implementations of Solana’s core primitives. Firedancer’s testnet, Frankendancer, is a combination of Agave, developed by Solana Labs, and Firedancer. At this year’s Solana Breakpoint, Frankendancer was announced as live on mainnet, with Firedancer live on testnet. Liquidity Liquidity is important for an efficient Web3 economy, as it determines how quickly assets can be traded without impacting price. Trading volumes on Solana have historically been much lower than Ethereum, by a factor of 2 or more. However the speed and low-fee properties of Solana has led to a recent catch up, when Solana trading volumes briefly surpassed Ethereum (July and August 2024). Both ecosystems see real-world use cases and tokenization, particularly with stablecoins which are prime trading assets, has strong drivers for increased liquidity. Staking also impacts the levels of liquidity in both Ethereum and Solana, as both ETH and SOL require tokens to be locked in order to stake. Today, only 28% of the overall supply of ETH is staked, yet liquid staking has claimed the top spot in Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem. Liquid staking provides stakers with a Liquid Staking Token (LST) of their assets, one which is available to hold, trade, or participate in DeFi. The availability of liquid staking solutions is key to Ethereum’s economy: without a centralized marketplace, buyers and sellers must provide liquidity in pools to allow for assets to be bought, sold, and swapped across DEXes and DeFi platforms. Liquid staking providers, such as Liquid Collective, allow greater capital efficiency for stakers wishing to receive rewards, while also giving them the liquidity to participate in Ethereum DeFi. Similarly, liquid staking has become the largest portion of Solana’s DeFi ecosystem, yet lags behind Ethereum significantly. The total market cap of staked Solana tokens is $57B. However, the market cap for liquid staking tokens is $3.8B, a liquid staking ratio of 6.60%. Conclusion While Ethereum holds a lead in terms of deeper liquidity, institutional trust, and a thriving L2 ecosystem, Solana’s momentum as a high-performance L1 is clear. Ethereum is building an increasingly modular stack, while Solana believes in the highly optimized, monolithic structure. The institutional confidence in ETH as an asset is highlighted by the recent introduction of ETFs, and initiatives such as the recently introduced Node Operator Risk Standard (NORS) certification establishes an objective benchmark of excellence for professional Ethereum node operators. But Solana’s achievements, and future potential, cannot be understated. Solana is actively scaling its mainnet infrastructure, creating a superhighway for future growth without fragmenting liquidity across L2s. Furthermore, Solana’s institutional interest has been signaled by a number of major players, including Franklin Templeton. While Ethereum’s advantage as a first mover is evident, both networks will play important roles in shaping the future of finance in both 2024 and beyond.

Title: Binance CEO Richard Teng on Navigating Crypto Regulation and Accelerating Adoption

In a candid interview on CoinDesk TV, Richard Teng, CEO of Binance, opened up about his role at the world’s largest crypto exchange, the company’s relationship with global regulators, and his outlook on the future of cryptocurrency adoption. Over the course of the discussion, Teng shared insights into the challenges and successes Binance has faced, his commitment to innovation, and the broader implications of crypto’s evolution. Since taking on the role of CEO at Binance, Teng has been focused on building a robust and compliant platform for its 220 million users worldwide. Teng noted that Binance has made significant strides in expanding its presence and gaining regulatory approvals across multiple jurisdictions, including Indonesia, India, Kazakhstan, Thailand, and Dubai. Reflecting on the company’s journey, Teng emphasized that Binance’s primary mission is to support the “freedom of money” and foster a vibrant blockchain ecosystem. He acknowledged the challenges Binance faced when he took over, such as regulatory fines, but emphasized that the platform’s strong foundation and user trust, built over seven years, have allowed it to continue thriving. Teng was clear in addressing the regulatory hurdles Binance has faced, particularly the skepticism from global regulators. He highlighted that the regulatory landscape has shifted dramatically in the last few years, with more countries enacting clearer frameworks for cryptocurrency. As a former financial services regulator himself, Teng understands the importance of balancing innovation with risk mitigation. He stressed that regulation should not be one-dimensional and must support both the protection of users and the growth of the crypto sector. In terms of the broader industry, Teng mentioned that crypto has been misunderstood by regulators and the public alike. He urged policymakers to better educate themselves about blockchain technology and the benefits of cryptocurrencies. According to Teng, the perception that crypto is primarily used for illicit activities is outdated, with the actual amount of crypto-related money laundering being minuscule compared to traditional fiat currencies. One of the most significant developments Teng highlighted is the growing institutional interest in cryptocurrency. He described 2024 as a landmark year for crypto adoption, with increasing regulatory clarity and institutions like BlackRock moving from crypto skepticism to advocacy. Teng believes that institutional involvement is critical to driving mainstream adoption, marking a pivotal shift in how cryptocurrencies are perceived by traditional financial institutions. According to Teng, the rapid growth in Binance’s user base is a testament to the increasing pace of crypto adoption. The platform gained its first 100 million users in five years, the second 100 million in just two years, and Teng expects the next 100 million users to come even faster. Binance remains committed to supporting this accelerated growth by continuously improving its products and services. Security and compliance are two of Binance’s top priorities, according to Teng. He noted that Binance’s compliance spending has increased significantly, with $230 million allocated in 2023, up from $158 million the previous year. Binance has also invested heavily in expanding its compliance team, with over 500 staff dedicated to ensuring regulatory adherence. In terms of security, Teng discussed the importance of protecting users’ assets and highlighted the company’s efforts in recovering funds lost to scams and fraud. Binance has helped users recover $73 million in stolen funds in 2023 alone. The company also maintains a $1 billion insurance fund (the SAFU Fund) to safeguard users’ assets in the event of a security breach. Teng touched on one of the biggest challenges facing the crypto industry: the lack of global regulatory harmony. Different jurisdictions treat cryptocurrencies differently—some as commodities, others as securities or payment tokens. This inconsistency makes it difficult for companies like Binance to operate seamlessly across borders. Teng advocated for a global regulatory framework that could streamline compliance and protect users more effectively. However, Teng acknowledged that achieving such a framework would require significant political will and collaboration among regulators. Despite the challenges, he remains optimistic that, as the industry matures, there will be greater convergence toward standardized regulations. When asked about his personal journey into the crypto space, Teng recalled how he first encountered cryptocurrency in 2017, a time when institutional investors were not involved in the space. He admitted that he never imagined himself leading Binance, given his background in traditional finance and regulation, but his belief in the transformative potential of blockchain technology ultimately drew him into the industry. Looking forward, Teng is bullish about the future of cryptocurrency. He envisions rapid growth in adoption and continued technological advancements, particularly in areas like asset tokenization and decentralized finance (DeFi). His goal is to position Binance at the forefront of these developments while maintaining the company’s commitment to security, compliance, and user protection. As for challenges, Teng acknowledged that crypto is a highly dynamic industry where new obstacles arise daily. However, he remains focused on sustainable growth and ensuring that Binance continues to innovate and adapt to the changing landscape.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Microsoft is doubling down on its cloud computing and artificial intelligence investment. Earlier this week, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella highlighted the company's plan to invest up to $1.3 billion over the next three years to build its infrastructure in Mexico to foster these advances. The tech giant plans to use its $1.3 billion investment to enhance broad adoption of AI technology across small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). Microsoft aspires to reach up to 5 million Mexicans and 30,000 SMBs in three years through the initiative. This happens as OpenAI just unveiled OpenAI Academy — the program is designed to make generative AI more accessible to developers across low and middle-income countries with up to $1 million in API credits. According to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella: “We are entering a new era of AI with the promise to create inclusive economic growth and opportunity across every role, industry, and country, including in Mexico. Our investments in AI infrastructure and skilling in Mexico will help ensure people and organizations across the country realize the benefits of this technology shift.” Microsoft marks 38-years in Mexico with companies like Grupo Bimbo, Tec de Monterrey and Cemex onboard its AI train. With its new initiative, the tech giant hopes to address emerging health concerns, connectivity issues and promote sustainability as part of its broader plans to become a carbon negative, water positive, and zero waste company. It's apparent that it takes an arm and a leg to keep AI operations running. For instance, OpenAI spends up to $700,000 to keep ChatGPT running. Still, the payoff isn't allowing the AI firm to break even. Reports hitting mainstream media indicate that the ChatGPT maker could be on the brink of bankruptcy, with projections of $5 billion in losses over the next year. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. However, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Apple will reportedly participate in the firm's latest round of funding to keep its operations afloat, pushing its market cap well beyond $150 billion. Market analysts and experts are confident that OpenAI will become the world's dominant AI company, further citing that it's in a unique consumer and enterprise position. Incidentally, Microsoft is having the same issues, with some of its investors raising concerns over its high expenditure on AI projects, citing its difficult to establish a clear path toward profitability in the category. Last year, the tech giant partnered with OpenAI and invested $100 billion in a project dubbed Stargate to free themselves from an overdependence on NVIDIA for AI chips. Similarly, the company recently partnered with BlackRock to raise $100 billion to 'emancipate themselves from the shackles' of insufficient power and increase data centers for their ambitious AI dreams.

Title: BlackRock report adds fuel to debate over Bitcoin price correlations, calling it “unique diversifier”
URL: https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/09/26/blackrock-report-adds-fuel-to-debate-over-bitcoin-price-correlations-calling-it-unique-diversifier/
Time Published: 2024-09-26T14:28:05Z
Full Content:
As investors seek ways to harness Bitcoin’s volatile and often unpredictable nature, BlackRock argues that Bitcoin’s prices may be uncorrelated to stocks and other traditional assets in a new report. The authors call Bitcoin a “unique diversifier” because its behavior is difficult to analyze within traditional economic frameworks. While Bitcoin prices may correlate with established markers like the S&P 500 in the short-term, the report says, they often rally higher than others over time. “We view this pattern as instances of fundamentals eventually prevailing over short-term leveraged trading reactions,” the report said. Iván Rodríguez, an associate professor of finance at Eastern Michigan University, has come to a similar conclusion in his own research. “There are periods where the correlation seems to be really high and these periods where these correlations kind of decouple, like the correlation disappears, or it’s negative,” he said. “So when you look over the long-term it seems like they’re uncorrelated.” Rodríguez points to a concept called intermarket flows to explain why Bitcoin and other traditional assets tend to correlate in the short-term. During times of volatility, an investor might choose to sell S&P 500 and invest in Bitcoin or vice versa. “So it can induce a negative correlation. It can induce a positive correlation,” Rodríguez said. “But those decisions that I’m making, or the market’s making on aggregate, that’s going to drive prices.” As its proponents like to point out,, Bitcoin is decentralized, open-source and detached from fiat-currencies and major geopolitical risks. Because of this, the BlackRock report says, some investors have embraced it as a “flight to safety” over the last five years. This means it is viewed as a safe bet amid times of political and economic instability, similar to gold. “When we think about Bitcoin, we think about primarily as an emerging global monetary alternative,” Robert Mitchnick, BlackRock’s head of digital assets and one of the report’s authors, said in an interview with Bloomberg on Tuesday. As concerns over the U.S. national debt rise, Bitcoin becomes an attractive, alternative reserve asset, detached from the value of the U.S. dollar. BlackRock’s report claims that because of this, Bitcoin can be valuable in helping investors diversify their portfolios. “I think people are taking that idea to heart, and they are investing in Bitcoin to safeguard their money,” said Rodríguez, the Michigan professor. But, he cautions investors against overestimating Bitcoin’s diversification power. “I do think, from a diversification point of view, for example, because they are related fundamentally, because investors are investing both in that and in the stock market, it’s not going to have as good of a diversification effect as the authors’ claim,” Rodríguez added. At the moment, cryptocurrencies and other assets are showing high correlation. A recent Bloomberg study reported that the largest one hundred digital assets and the S&P 500 have been fluctuating together at a level only exceeded once before, in 2022. This could, of course, change based on new developments in the world. “Over the long term, bitcoin’s adoption trajectory is likely to be driven by the degree to which concerns rise and fall over global monetary instability, geopolitical disharmony, U.S. fiscal sustainability and U.S. political stability,” the report said. The new BlackRock report comes at a time when the world’s biggest asset manager has moved into digital assets in a major way following a shift in the regulatory environment. BlackRock became one of around a dozen firms offering Bitcoin exchange-traded funds earlier this year, an unprecedented step for both the company and the stock market. An ETF is usually a collection of stocks, bonds or other assets that can be listed as shares on a major exchange. In the case of Bitcoin, ETFs are a way to package cryptocurrencies and offer them on the stock market, making them accessible to a broader group of people. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF is known as iShares Bitcoin Trust, or IBIT. Today, IBIT has $22 billion in assets under management and is trading at $36. The ETF reached its highest volume in mid March, almost hitting $4 billion before settling around $1.5 billion. All of this suggests how Bitcoin is becoming an integral part of BlackRock’s business, and why understanding its complex cycles will be important in coming years. In June, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said that Bitcoin is “digitizing gold.” © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Why Financial Institutions Need to Engage in ESG

As the world becomes increasingly aware of the climate crisis, social inequalities, and corporate governance issues, consumers are demanding more responsibility from businesses, including banks and financial institutions. This shift didn't happen overnight, but the evolution of consumer attitudes towards environmental, social, and governance (ESG) principles, accelerated by global challenges like COVID-19, is forcing industries to reimagine their impact on the world. Evolving consumer expectations Consumers have always prioritized convenience, service quality, and product offerings when selecting a bank or financial institution. However, a growing awareness of social and environmental issues has transformed this rationale. Consumers today are looking beyond products and interest rates; they are scrutinizing how financial institutions align with their personal values around sustainability, social justice, and ethical governance. The data shows that 40% of US households would sacrifice some return to invest in companies that reflect their values. The rise of social media, instant access to information, and global movements like Extinction Rebellion, Just Stop Oil, etc. have amplified this shift. Younger generations, particularly those under 40, are leading the charge, placing pressure on businesses to not only serve their financial needs but also contribute meaningfully to societal challenges. For these consumers, it is no longer enough for a bank to avoid harmful practices – banks must now actively engage in sustainable and responsible initiatives to earn their trust. The data shows that 42% of US households would only do business with financial institutions that they believe are committed to improving social issues. The banking sector's response to ESG Recognizing this shift, many financial institutions in the US have started embracing ESG principles, although the degree of commitment varies. Large banks, such as JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, have begun implementing sustainability goals, with some pledging to achieve net-zero carbon emissions within their lending portfolios by 2050. These moves signal that ESG has become a core consideration, not just a marketing tool. Banks are investing in renewable energy projects, issuing green bonds, and offering products like ESG-focused investment funds to cater to this evolving consumer base. The investment sector's response to ESG Investment firms are also adapting by offering their clients portfolios that prioritize ESG-conscious companies. BlackRock, for example, has publicly committed to making sustainability a core component of its investment strategy. This is not just about meeting regulatory requirements but also about attracting a consumer base that is increasingly selective about where their money is invested. However, while some financial institutions have made strides in embracing ESG principles, others have been slower to act. For many, the process of integrating these considerations into their business model requires a significant cultural and operational shift, which can take time to realize. The impact of COVID-19 on ESG initiatives The COVID-19 pandemic threw a wrench in the momentum for many businesses looking to invest in and roll out ESG initiatives. With the economy in crisis mode, many companies diverted resources toward more immediate concerns, such as maintaining liquidity, preserving jobs, and meeting short-term financial obligations. This resulted in delays in launching or expanding ESG-related programs. In the banking and finance sectors, the focus shifted to stabilizing operations and responding to customer needs during unprecedented financial uncertainty. Banks had to prioritize lending and support for small businesses and vulnerable communities affected by the pandemic, while ESG initiatives often took a backseat. The pandemic also reinforced the importance of ESG. It exposed systemic vulnerabilities, from economic inequalities to the need for stronger corporate governance, prompting a reevaluation of long-term strategies. As the immediate crisis subsides, businesses are finding that ESG commitments are more important than ever in building resilience for future challenges. Like businesses, consumers’ attentions were also redirected and focused on immediate needs such as healthcare, employment, and financial stability. The emphasis on ESG temporarily decreased, as consumers' attention was drawn toward personal survival rather than the ethical and sustainable practices of corporations. This shift in focus highlights the fragility of ESG priorities during times of crisis but also sets the stage for a renewed and stronger commitment post-pandemic. ESG across industries The banking sector is not the only industry where ESG has become a significant driver of consumer decision-making. Across sectors such as retail, technology, and automotive, ESG has become a vital part of brand identity and product development. For example, electric vehicle manufacturers like Tesla have positioned themselves as leaders in sustainability, making environmental responsibility central to their value proposition. In retail, companies like Patagonia and Nike have embraced sustainability and ethical labor practices, responding to consumers who are willing to pay more for eco-friendly and socially responsible products. The trend is clear: consumers are increasingly expecting companies to align with their values, and this mindset carries over when choosing financial products or providers. How financial institutions can better support ESG and social initiatives For banks and financial institutions, the path forward is clear: engaging deeply with ESG principles is no longer optional. Those that fail to prioritize these areas risk losing relevance, particularly among younger, values-driven consumers. So how can financial institutions better support ESG, local communities, and social initiatives? 1. Product innovation: Develop products and services that support ESG goals, such as green bonds, sustainability-linked loans, and ESG-focused mutual funds. By aligning their offerings with consumer values, banks can attract customers who are committed to social and environmental change. 2. Community investment: Support local communities through targeted investments in small businesses, affordable housing, and renewable energy projects. This not only builds goodwill but also strengthens long-term customer relationships. 3. Transparency and accountability: Consumers demand authenticity. Financial institutions should provide clear and transparent reporting on their ESG commitments, offering measurable goals and progress updates. Establishing trust is key to maintaining consumer loyalty. 4. Employee engagement: Foster a culture of social responsibility within the organization by encouraging employees to participate in ESG-related initiatives, from volunteer programs to corporate sustainability efforts. Employees who feel connected to these values are more likely to be engaged and contribute to the company's long-term success. Why financial institutions need to engage in ESG The financial sector wields significant influence over the broader economy and has the ability to drive meaningful change. By embracing ESG principles, banks and financial institutions not only meet consumer expectations but also contribute to solving some of the most pressing global challenges, from climate change to social inequality. As consumers continue to hold businesses to higher standards, the financial sector must recognize that its role is evolving. ESG is no longer a "nice to have" – it has become imperative to long-term success. Financial institutions that embrace this reality will not only meet the demands of today’s consumers but also help shape a more sustainable, equitable future.

Partnership with BlackRock and Securitize brings new UStb stablecoin to Ethena Labs' product lineup. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Ethena Labs has announced the introduction of UStb, a new stablecoin fully backed by BlackRock’s on-chain BUIDL fund, developed in partnership with Securitize. This product is an additional fiat stablecoin alongside USDe, offering a differentiated risk profile to users and exchange partners. UStb will reportedly function identically to traditional stablecoins and exist as an isolated product distinct from USDe. BlackRock and Securitize’s collateralization aims to provide stability and trust in the asset’s backing, appealing to users seeking alternatives within the stablecoin market. One concern regarding USDe has been its response to negative funding rate environments. Despite six months of bearish conditions, Ethena’s sUSDe has not yet experienced a negative funding rate. However, the protocol has mechanisms to adjust its backing composition dynamically between basis positions and liquid stable products in varying interest rate environments. USDe will now reportedly benefit from incorporating UStb during weak funding conditions. If governance deems it necessary, Ethena can close hedging positions and reallocate backing assets to UStb to mitigate risks associated with negative funding rates. This flexibility enhances the protocol’s resilience and adaptability in fluctuating market conditions. As Ethena expands into centralized exchange collateral offerings beyond its current integrations with Bybit and Bitget, it plans to offer exchange partners the choice between two distinct products for margin collateral. The introduction of UStb provides additional options for exchanges and users, potentially broadening the adoption of Ethena’s stablecoin solutions. Further updates on UStb’s timelines and new exchange integrations are expected to be shared soon. The forthcoming details will outline how UStb will be integrated into additional platforms, enhancing its accessibility and utility within the crypto ecosystem. Ethena Labs claims a desire to continue to innovate in DeFi, aiming to transform Ethereum into a crypto-native yield-bearing stablecoin that operates independently of the traditional banking system. The company’s approach involves leveraging delta-neutral strategies, on-chain custody, and derivatives to manage volatility and improve scalability and stability. Ethena’s USDe is a synthetic dollar fully backed and transparently recorded on-chain, allowing seamless integration throughout the DeFi ecosystem. It surpassed $3b in market cap in June but has since retraced slightly to $2.5 billion. The introduction of UStb plans to complement USDe by providing an alternative stablecoin option that is particularly useful in varying market conditions. Following the announcement of UStb, Ethena Labs’ ENA governance token experienced a notable surge over the past 24 hours. The token’s price increased by approximately 14%, climbing from a low of $0.307 to a high of $0.378. Trading volume also saw a significant uptick, reaching around $196.1 million.

Title: AT&T, T-Mobile Embrace ‘Open Access’ Fiber After Years Of Opposition
URL: https://www.techdirt.com/2024/09/26/att-t-mobile-embrace-open-access-fiber-after-years-of-opposition/
Time Published: 2024-09-26T12:26:00Z
Full Content:
Broadband Two years ago, Techdirt’s Copia Institute released a report discussing how open access fiber networks were a potential path toward boosting fiber competition in the United States. Such networks, sometimes community owned, involve collaboratively building a centralized fiber infrastructure that multiple competitors can come in and compete over. In instances where this has been successfully achieved — like Utah’s Utopia or in Ammon, Idaho — users sometimes have the option of dozens of different fiber ISPs, which in some cases can be switched between with just a few clicks on a web portal. The projects lower the cost of market entry. The competition drives down prices, improves service quality, and generally results in better broadband access. Understandably big ISPs like Comcast and AT&T didn’t much like that, and spent years fighting such projects knowing they threatened their regional dominance. But now some executives at AT&T and T-Mobile appear to have seen the light, with both companies striking new deals to build or participate in such open access networks: “Once staunch opponents of open access, Tier 1 Internet Service Providers are now entering a space that, in the United States, has been pioneered by local governments two decades ago. In the last year-and-a-half, AT&T has embraced open access through its Gigapower joint venture with BlackRock, the world’s largest money manager with $10 trillion assets under management.” In this case BlackRock is building the network, and AT&T would be the “anchor tenant” (the first ISP to sign up for service). The about face for AT&T is fairly significant; the company went from fighting such network vehemently, to their CEO making the rounds talking up the benefits of open access. The approach always made sense financially and developmentally; AT&T and larger ISPs simply opposed it because they didn’t want anything disrupting their regional telecom monopolies or duopolies, which allow them to price gouge captive customers trapped in markets without competition. AT&T’s opposition was particularly venomous when community-owned networks (municipals, cooperatives) were involved. What changed these companies minds? They’re lining up to potentially obtain more than $45 billion in broadband subsidies currently looming thanks to 2021 infrastructure bill legislation. That money isn’t expected to start flowing in earnest until next year. The bullishness is great to see, but it will be interesting to see if it remains intact once AT&T (a company with a long history of making promises it doesn’t deliver on) has nabbed their desired cut of taxpayer funds. Filed Under: BEAD, broadband, competition, fiber, high speed internet, infrastructure bill, open access, telecom Companies: at&t, blackrock, t-mobile Yeah, I have my extreme doubts. Who wants to bet that they’ll half-ass the deployment of these networks too? Or that they’ll deploy them and then pull out of the deal once they’ve gotten a big chunk of that 45b? Don’t think you’ll find many people arguing against you on that one. The usual trick is to give unfair preference to the “anchor tenant”. You can buy service from a third-party provider, but, you know, sometimes someone “accidentally” disconnects a fibre, and tickets from the third-party providers don’t get handled quickly. Maybe those providers have unreasonable tariffs, such that they can’t realistically offer unlimited service but the anchors can. Or the third-party wholesale rate is more than the advertised first-party retail rate, which is the current situation with Bell fibre in Canada. Such shenanigans are why the U.K.’s regulator eventually demanded full “functional separation” between B.T. and OpenReach. If we really knew what we were doing, we would have fibre to every home, and allow anyone to run over it. There is no need to have EXCLUSIVE USE of any fiber optic cable to the home. The cool thing about fiber is you can MULTIPLE services over the same fibre, just by using a different wavelength of light. So you could have one fibre, carrying internet from multiple providers, tv from multiple providers, phone from multiple providers etc.. It is 100% possible and doable if there was a little effort. The cool thing about fiber is you can MULTIPLE services over the same fibre, just by using a different wavelength of light. 10G-PON uses different wavelengths from GPON, which means a 10G subscriber won’t be slowed down by GPON subscribers on their node. RFoG also uses a different wavelength. But I’m not sure an ISP can just arbitrarily choose the wavelengths for each service, such that one could subscribe to multiple 10G ISPs, for example. I’m also not sure it particularly matters. Multi-fibre cables are cheap enough to run to each subscriber, much as houses and apartments were usually provisioned with 2 telephone pairs per dwelling. In both cases, most people will never need it. (Why would they? If they have fast unlimited internet service, they can use that to connect to whatever other services they’ll need. If they want redundancy, they probably don’t want to use fibres with common routing.) They’ve announced back in 2022: Gigapower plans to deploy a fiber network to 1.5 million customers located outside of AT&T’s existing 21-state wireline presence using a commercial open access platform. This will contribute to AT&T’s previously announced goal of deploying fiber to more than 30 million locations by the end of 2025. Since they haven’t announced something big since then, this may look like they try to prospect for find some new markets but still waiting for a bunch of federal investments to start connecting anything. Clearly, it’s not the BlackRock’s $10T assets that will be used to building fiber infrastructure. I’m an American but live in Italy. Many things do not run very smoothly here, but internet tends to be quite good. Each neighborhood here has a carrier that installs the fiber and runs it. They can be your provider or you might select another. We pay under 20 usd or month for 800mbps down. It has been very reliable. I’ve seen this structure multiple times. First up, the ISP contributes its expertise in proscribing the network components and the investment company contributes the money to roll out the network. Once the network has been built out, the ISP buys the network from the investment company so they only have one month/quarter with bad results and the investment company has more money than they put up. Oh, and the `open’ claim is long forgotten by that point. What changed these companies minds? They’re lining up to potentially obtain more than $45 billion in broadband subsidies currently looming thanks to 2021 infrastructure bill legislation. That money isn’t expected to start flowing in earnest until next year. The bullishness is great to see, but it will be interesting to see if it remains intact once AT&T (a company with a long history of making promises it doesn’t deliver on) has nabbed their desired cut of taxpayer funds. Hold on a minute. Shouldn’t that money be going to Blackrock? Why does AT&T get a big slice if they’re just the service provider and not the implementor/hardware provider?

Plus: How Phillip Morris International is rehabilitating nicotine’s image with the wildly popular flavored Zyn pouches, which are more profitable than PMI’s cigarette division. Good morning, Sixty-two years after Sam Walton opened the first Walmart in Rogers, Arkansas, its spectacular success has minted his eldest son as a centibillionaire. Rob Walton became the first member of America’s richest family to hold a 12-figure fortune, worth an estimated $100 billion. Shoppers have flocked to the budget retailer amid high inflation, sending Walmart’s shares up 53% year-to-date. Just 15 other people are worth $100 billion or more, including Elon Musk and Nvidia cofounder and CEO Jensen Huang. With Walmart’s stock market tear, Rob’s siblings Jim and Alice may soon join him in this elite club. Illustration by Alex Castro; Icons by Noun Project A Forbes review of Facebook found nearly 800 groups offering to connect women to abortion remedies—at least 300 of which operate in countries where abortion is at least sometimes illegal, or even a criminal offense. But the groups are something of a double-edged sword, says Katy Mayall, the director for strategic initiatives at the Center for Reproductive Rights. While they may get some women help, they can be a gateway to scams and fraudsters and carry health and privacy risks for people in restrictive countries. New York City Mayor Eric Adams was indicted on federal criminal charges by a grand jury Wednesday night, capping a series of federal corruption investigations against him and several high-ranking members of his administration. In a defiant video statement shortly before the indictment was reported, Adams said the charges were “entirely false, based on lies” and dismissed calls for him to resign, saying the people of New York “elected me to lead this city, and lead it I will.” Home mortgage rates are posted outside a real estate office in Los Angeles. Since the Federal Reserve’s major interest rate cut last week, yields for 10-year Treasury notes, the benchmark for loans like mortgages and auto rates, have actually increased. Now expectations have shifted for the Fed to enact another big cut amid mounting evidence that the economy needs even more of a jolt. Coinbase, the largest publicly traded cryptocurrency exchange in the world, has custody of 11% of all Bitcoin tokens. Now, Brian Armstrong, the company’s chief executive and cofoun­der, wants to disrupt his money machine—the key to that pivot is Base, a system designed to improve upon Ethereum’s blockchain by potentially speeding up transactions. A Delaware court extended an order stalling Bolt founder Ryan Breslow’s bid to raise $450 million, characterizing the deal as a “prisoner’s dilemma” for investors. It’s the latest snag in Breslow’s ongoing bid to raise fresh capital for the struggling payments company, as three irate Bolt investors requested the halt on the Series F financing round—including the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock. The Senate voted 78-18 to approve legislation Wednesday to continue funding the government through December 20, narrowly averting a shutdown just five days before the deadline. The short-term spending deal still requires lawmakers to either hash out a funding deal or pass another extension in December, about six weeks after Election Day. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Ben Cardin (D-Md.) was the target of a sophisticated spoofing operation where a video caller used deepfake imagery to pose as a high-level Ukrainian official, according to multiple reports late Wednesday. In a notice reported by NBC News, the Senate security office warned lawmakers about an “active social engineering campaign ... targeting Senators and Senate staff.” President Joe Biden said he was not forced out of the presidential race in his first sit-down interview since his historic decision to end his campaign in July. Biden said on ABC’s The View that he always saw himself as a “transition president,” but insisted he would have beaten former President Donald Trump. The Israeli military is reportedly considering a ground invasion into Lebanon, amid an escalating conflict with Hezbollah that has killed hundreds and threatens to turn into a full-blown war. Late Wednesday, the U.S., France and several key allies issued a statement calling for an immediate 21-day cease-fire, noting that the conflict “presents an unacceptable risk of a broader regional escalation.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said he has not yet responded to the “U.S.-French proposal” and has “instructed the IDF to continue fighting with full force.” Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images Since hedge fund Elliott Investment Management, run by billionaire activist investor Paul Singer, announced in June it had taken a $1.9 billion stake in Southwest Airlines, the carrier has made policy changes, upended its board and had its chairman resign. But it’s apparently not enough: On Tuesday, the hedge fund announced it would call for a special meeting at Southwest Airlines “in the coming weeks.” In a letter to shareholders, Elliott accuses Southwest’s leadership of obstructing a leadership change with “a chaotic series of defensive actions.” Illustration by Alex Castro for Forbes; Photos by Helmut Hess, Michael M. Santiago : Getty Images TOPLINE Philip Morris International is rehabilitating nicotine’s image with its wildly in-demand flavored Zyn pouches, embraced by celebrities, entrepreneurs and star athletes. By the end of 2024, PMI, which owns Zyn manufacturer Swedish Match, expects to sell as much as 580 million cans of Zyn, a 50% increase over the 385 million sold last year. Forbes estimates that Zyn sales, which PMI does not break out in public filings, generated $1.3 billion last year (about 3.7% of PMI’s $35 billion in total revenue) and could hit $1.9 billion this year. Zyn is six times more profitable than PMI’s cigarette division, says Bonnie Herzog, an analyst for Goldman Sachs who covers the tobacco industry. And unlike cigarettes, which have been steadily declining in volume for the last decade, Zyn is in hypergrowth mode. Shipment volume in the U.S. has jumped a staggering 238% since 2020. But while pouches have successfully divorced nicotine from the cigarette, they still have health risks. Plus, the FDA has not authorized them for sale, although Swedish Match filed an application in March 2020. This means the products are technically illegal, but the FDA is allowing them to stay on the market while the agency reviews applications. And at least five lawsuits allege that PMI is marketing Zyn to minors. “Zyn is Juul 2.0,” says Scott Schlesinger, a Florida-based attorney who recently filed a class action against PMI and Swe­dish Match. But Stacey Kennedy, head of PMI’s U.S. operations, insists that PMI is marketing Zyn only to adults who already smoke or use nicotine. “I think Zyn is proof that nicotine can be used [to replace] more harmful products,” she says. WHY IT MATTERS “Zyn has become a runaway success for PMI. Its newest nicotine product will generate nearly $2 billion in sales this year, Forbes estimates,” says staff writer Will Yakowicz. “But the nicotine pouch is more than just a financial juggernaut—Zyn has spawned its own culture online (also known as the Zynternet), with viral memes and celebrities touting the brand. And it has even entered the presidential election: Ohio Senator JD Vance has been photographed holding a container of Zyn, while on the other side of the aisle, Tim Walz levied a 95% tax on Zyn and other nicotine products as governor of Minnesota.” MORE Meet The Kings Of The Pre-Roll Joint Ozempic may lower the risk of opioid overdose in patients with Type 2 diabetes, a new study suggests. It’s the latest research showing the drug’s positive impact on an unrelated condition: Around 3,000: The number of study participants with Type 2 diabetes and opioid use disorder who were prescribed semaglutide (the active ingredient in drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy) About 60%: The decrease in opioid overdoses associated with semaglutide 107,543: The number of drug overdose deaths in the U.S. in 2023, per CDC data, with opioid-related overdoses making up more than 81,000 of those deaths Soft skills, such as your ability to communicate, are just as critical in your career as hard skills like coding or graphic design. Some of the most important soft skills are public speaking, knowing how to sell and negotiate and project management.

More Info The OPEC+ alliance is not discussing any proposals of changes to its current oil production plan, which envisages the group starting to add supply to the market in December, Russia’s Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said on Thursday. OPEC+ initially planned to begin unwinding part of the 2.2 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude production cuts from October this year. However, after oil prices crashed in late August and early September, OPEC+ delayed the start of the unwinding of the cuts by two months until December 2024. According to Novak, Russia’s top oil official and representative at the OPEC+ meetings, the group, at present, isn’t looking to make any changes to its current production plan. In addition, the Russian official claimed that all OPEC+ producers are currently in full compliance with the agreed output quotas. “All countries are generally fulfilling their obligations under the agreement. We are observing and monitoring the situation on the market in terms of the balance of supply and demand,” Russian news agency Interfax quoted Novak as saying on the sidelines of an energy conference in Russia. Earlier today, reports emerged that Saudi Arabia is determined to begin bringing back production as of December 1, as it now seeks to regain the market share it had lost over the past months with its large output cut. Saudi Arabia is willing to endure short-term oil price and revenue pain as it is making a U-turn in policy and going to take back market share and ditching its unofficial $100 oil price target, the Financial Times reported on Thursday, quoting sources with knowledge of the latest Saudi thinking. This latest thinking suggests that the Kingdom has come to accept that it would have to endure a period of lower oil prices if it wants to take market share back.

Title: BlackRock Continues To Buy Bitcoin: Holdings Now Reach 358,000 BTC Worth $22 Billion

In less than nine months since the launch of its Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) following the approval of these investment vehicles by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), asset manager BlackRock has established itself as the world’s largest Bitcoin fund. According to on-chain data from blockchain analysis platform Arkham, BlackRock has aggressively expanded its Bitcoin holdings through its ETF, known as IBIT over the last months. Despite recent market volatility that saw significant dips in Bitcoin’s price on August 5 and September 6, BlackRock continued to buy more Bitcoin, thereby supporting not only the token’s value but also its own asset base. As of September 25, BlackRock’s holdings have reached approximately 358,000 BTC, valued at around $22.76 billion, representing about 1.70% of Bitcoin’s total supply of 21 million. In comparison, BlackRock’s Bitcoin holdings exceed those of Grayscale, another major crypto asset manager in the industry, by nearly 100,000 BTC. Grayscale currently holds approximately 258,671 BTC, valued at $16.45 billion, highlighting the significant gap that BlackRock has created in the BTC investment landscape. While BlackRock has taken a commanding lead in Bitcoin, Grayscale maintains an advantage in Ethereum (ETH) holdings. Arkham’s data indicates that Grayscale possesses 2.104 million ETH, valued at roughly $5.45 billion based on the current trading price of $2,600 per ETH. In contrast, BlackRock’s Ethereum holdings amount to only 349,970 ETH, valued at approximately $910 million. BlackRock’s support for Bitcoin extends beyond mere investment; it includes a strong endorsement of the technology underpinning the cryptocurrency. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Robbie Mitchnick, head of digital assets at BlackRock, challenged the prevailing notion that Bitcoin should be categorized as a “risk-on” asset. During Tuesday’s interview, Mitchnick noted that while Bitcoin has recently shown a high correlation with US equities, this relationship may be misleading. The head of digital assets at BlackRock noted that risk-on assets, such as stocks, commodities, and high-yield bonds, perform well during periods of market optimism and economic growth. Conversely, assets like gold are sought after in times of uncertainty, providing a safe haven for investors. Mitchnick drew parallels between Bitcoin and gold, saying “gold shows a lot of the same patterns”, referring to their temporary correlations with equities. He emphasized that the long-term correlation between BTC and traditional financial assets is close to zero. One of BTC’s defining characteristics is its decentralized nature, Mitchnick added. No single country or government controls it, he said, which adds to its appeal as a global monetary alternative. Mitchnick went on to highlight Bitcoin’s scarcity, global reach and decentralized framework, describing it as a “non-sovereign asset”. He pointed out that BTC has no specific country risk and no counterparty risk, making it a compelling option for investors looking to diversify their portfolios. At the time of writing, the largest cryptocurrency on the market has given back some of the gains made during Tuesday’s trading session, after hitting a one-month high of $64,700. Currently, BTC is trading at $63,220, down a slight 0.3% over the 24-hour period.

Title: Why Bitcoin’s Biggest Banker Is Making A Risky Pivot

“We’re at a really exci­ting moment for crypto,” enthuses Brian Armstrong, chief executive and cofoun­der of Coinbase, the largest publicly traded cryptocurrency exchange in the world. “There is a shift happening from crypto being primarily an asset class that people want to trade to speculate on to it becoming more and more used for daily utility,” he insists. “Four hundred million people or so have used crypto globally.” That’s debatable. When it comes to crypto, most people care about pri­ces, and those have been on a tear lately. Bitcoin has more than doubled in the last year to around $58,000. More than 20 crypto ETFs holding $54 billion in digital assets are trading in the U.S. Crypto is more widely held than ever and has become an important topic in the presidential election. With Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao and FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried now both in prison, Armstrong has emerged as the movement’s most prominent spokesperson. Photo by Cody Pickens for Forbes Given that Coinbase’s stock mirrors trading in Bitcoin, Armstrong is a billionaire seven times over at age 41. The crypto­currency exchange he cofounded 12 years ago to become the “Gmail for Bitcoin” has a market capitalization of $40 billion and crypto assets under its custody of $270 billion. That includes holding more than $20 billion for BlackRock ($10 trillion in assets under management), now the world’s largest crypto ETF provider. In 2023, the company, which makes around half of its money from trading fees, netted $95 million on revenue of $3.1 billion. This year is on track to be much better: In the first six months of 2024, Coinbase’s revenue amounted to $3.1 billion but net income soared to $1.2 billion. If there were such a thing as a “Too Big to Fail” institution in the world of digital assets, Coinbase would be it. Just in terms of Bitcoin, Coinbase has custody of 11% of all tokens in existence. For crypto’s second-most important currency, Ether, its share is even larger at an estimated 14% of all tokens. If Coinbase imploded, the consequences could be catastrophic. Not everyone is a fan. In June 2023, the Securities and Exchange Commission sued Coinbase for acting as an unregistered exchange, broker-dealer and clearing firm—all activities it engages in for more than 14,500 institutions, as well as 8 million active retail customers. The case is likely to go to trial in 2025. Crypto evangelists hate the idea of centralized power, but operationally, Coinbase is more similar to other command-and-control financial institutions like JPMorgan than it is to something like an employee-owned credit union. Its main businesses are trading, custody and co-mana­ging (with Circle) a huge ($35 billion) stablecoin operation that pegs the value of the USDC token to the U.S. dollar. Coinbase’s dominant position allows it to charge high fees. Purchasing $5,000 of Bitcoin on the exchange will cost you $90. On Kraken it costs $20, and on Robinhood it’s free. But Armstrong is a crypto idealist, and he isn’t entirely happy with this state of affairs. He wants to disrupt his money machine, creating a whole new infrastructure for rapid-fire transactions, which will not only lower fees but also weaken the control of big tech and financial firms. “The whole reason I got into this and the mission of Coinbase is around increasing economic freedom in the world,” he says. “The vision here is that crypto is going to power more and more of global GDP. [It will] create sound money, sound financial infrastructure for people all over the world with lower fees, lower friction.” The key element in Armstrong’s latest corporate push is Base, which launched in August 2023. Base is a so-called Layer 2 platform. Instead of being a self-sufficient blockchain like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana, it is designed to improve upon Ethereum by potentially processing thousands of transactions per second, costing less than a cent each. Ethereum can handle only about a dozen transactions per second, each costing an average of $1. It’s a huge improvement, but still far less than existing financial networks. Visa’s global processing network, VisaNet, can handle 65,000 transactions a second. Armstrong would like his low-cost Base to be interoperable with other Ethereum-based blockchains and support decentralized versions of Facebook, YouTube, Google, Uber and X. He’s also onboarding merchants ranging from Anheuser-Busch to Wharton business school using his Coinbase Commerce service, taking aim at the likes of PayPal, Mastercard and Visa, which charge fees as high as 3% per transaction. Coinbase Commerce charges only 1%. But consumer adoption has been slow. The network processes fewer than 2,000 transactions daily. Visa does that many every second. “Some of these businesses might have only 5% margins, and 2% of it is going to the card network,” Armstrong says. “There’s no reason it needs to be this way. It’s an unnecessary tax on the economy.” According to Oppenheimer analyst Owen Lau, Base’s estimated 1 million active users are expec­ted to contribute $100 million to Coinbase’s revenue in 2024. Most of that is from trading fees (this is crypto, after all). Ironically, if Coinbase is going to be even more successful with Base, it will have to give up control—and share fees. Coinbase is currently Base’s only “sequencer,” crypto jargon for operator or supervisor. To become decentralized, Base will require more sequencers. If Base had four sequen­cers, Coinbase might earn only 25% of the total fees. Talk of lower fees and revenue dilution may not win Coinbase long-term fans on Wall Street. In the short term, shareholders don’t seem to mind. Shares of Coinbase have nearly doubled in the last 12 months. As long as the price of crypto keeps soaring—and the geeks keep tra­ding it—Armstrong can spout as much idealistic claptrap as he wants.

Title: Dublin woman in Vancouver: Finding work has been hard but Ironman gives me purpose
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/abroad/2024/09/26/life-in-vancouver-and-its-hurdles-for-an-irishwoman-throwing-herself-into-ironman/
Time Published: 2024-09-26T05:01:00Z
Full Content:
I’m from Blackrock, Dublin, and in March, I left Ireland to travel through Asia and America before landing in Vancouver, Canada, in July. When I decided to move here alone, I knew it would be challenging, but I didn’t fully grasp just how much. The city is beautiful, but the reality of being in a new place, with no job and no familiar faces, hit me hard. The loneliness could have been overwhelming, but I chose a different path – I set goals, achievable ones, that would help me find purpose and direction. Life in Vancouver, however, has its own set of hurdles. The job market here has been slow, and finding work has been tougher than I anticipated. Yet, instead of letting this get me down. I have thrown myself into my training daily. Training gives me purpose when everything else feels uncertain, I’ve learned. It structures my days, filling them with meaning and direction. One of the most ambitious goals I have set for myself is to complete my first full-distance Ironman 140.6 in Tempe Arizona in November (which consists of a 3.9km swim, a 180.2km bicycle race and then a 42.2km run, for a total of 226.3km – or 140.6 miles). Before taking on that challenge, I aimed to complete an official Ironman 70.3 in Penticton, British Columbia, on August 25th. The race was supposed to be a straightforward test of endurance, but the universe had other plans. On the morning of the race, the water temperature unexpectedly dropped to 10 degrees, forcing the organisers to cancel the swim. It was a curveball I didn’t expect, but I pushed forward, completing the bike and run portions and finishing in less than six hours. Obstacles in life are inevitable, but it is how we react to these that matters most. My dream is not just to compete, but to guide others, particularly disabled athletes, through the world of triathlons and Ironman races Crossing that finish line was a mix of frustration and triumph. The swim cancellation was disappointing, but it didn’t overshadow the sense of achievement I felt. This race was a stepping stone, a necessary part of my journey toward the full Ironman. I’m self-coached, driven by a passion that I hope will one day lead me to become a coach myself. My dream is not just to compete, but to guide others, particularly disabled athletes, through the world of triathlons and Ironman races. Each day I lace up my running shoes or hop on my bike, I’m not just working toward my goals, I’m building a foundation for my future. [ Why many Irish people chose Vancouver to go for a holiday or a longer stayOpens in new window ] [ A second life in Vancouver: ‘I made the decision to get away from any potential downward spiral into addiction’Opens in new window ] Without this focus, I think the loneliness would have been unbearable. Every run, every ride, every session, is a step closer to my goals – not just the physical ones, but the personal ones too. When you feel lost, set a goal. When you feel overwhelmed, take the first step. You’ll be amazed at what you can achieve when you give yourself direction. As a young woman navigating life in a new city, it’s crucial to carve out your own path, to find out who you are and what you’re made of. This journey has been about more than just completing races, I realise. It’s been about building resilience, finding inner strength and creating a future that I’m excited about. By the time I crossed the finish line in Penticton, I was physically exhausted but emotionally charged. There was no one waiting for me, no familiar face in the crowd to share the moment with, but I realised that didn’t diminish the victory. I celebrated myself, recognising that this was more than just the end of a race, it was a milestone in my journey of self-discovery and growth. In that moment, I understood that this period of my life, with all its challenges and solitude, was shaping me into someone stronger, more resilient and more self-reliant.

Title: Opportunity knocks for a new group of players on Emerging Ireland tour

The Emerging Ireland tour to South Africa in 2022 will serve as a benchmarking process, directly and indirectly, for the current squad who depart on Saturday for their three-match assignment in the land of the world champions. Simon Easterby, head coach again as he was two years ago, mentioned that half a dozen players from that Emerging Ireland squad went on to make their senior Test debuts. On Wednesday, backs coach Andrew Goodman figured that the aforementioned group had accumulated around 50 caps since then. As an initiative it was an unqualified success despite initial misgivings in some quarters, and the hope is that it will again provide a similar pathway for another tranche of players. Goodman is Ireland’s new backs coach, having moved from Leinster at the end of last season. He shadowed his predecessor Mike Catt during Ireland’s two Test drawn series against the Springboks and now returns to South Africa. The New Zealander is delighted to have a whistle around his neck again. He is relishing the first pitch session at the IRFU High-Performance Centre, where he will get to work with some of his previous charges at Leinster and a selection of the best young players from the other provinces. Goodman said: “We want to build depth and have competition in positions. We want guys to have that opportunity, see them in our structures, see how they play, how they learn. It’s just [discovering] that Irish way of doing things that is different to the way the provinces do things. “A lot of it is around our language, a little bit around how we want to play the game. The provinces are doing an amazing job, all the lads are very well coached. We are just trying to build on that but also add our flavour and what makes us [Ireland] different. “It’s a great opportunity for these boys to come in and experience what [senior] Test weeks are like and how they take on information and put that on to the field. It is important that they take it in from the first day. We can’t have people waiting around and holding back. We need them to come and put their best foot forward straight away.” Goodman said that time spent with his new coaching colleagues in the senior Irish set-up during the summer was invaluable. “In terms of South Africa, it was a great little introduction to see how the Irish set-up works, the language they use and how the week is run. “It was a great experience, and I suppose the energy they all came in with, the way they connected and the level of expectation around the way they do things, that accountability was huge. You could obviously see from the outside that it was a well-connected group. It was just great to see first-hand that energy and connection that they drove. “It was great to get a step ahead coming into the Emerging Ireland tour now and with November later on, so I guess there are differences in the way weeks are run but nothing major.” Goodman will be responsible for the team attack with Emerging Ireland before paring back the role a little in November when head coach Andy Farrell is in charge once again. Goodman said: “I’ll be doing a lot of work with the backs on strikes [moves] from scrum and lineout and on skill work for the team and assisting Andy, obviously, when it comes to November time. He’s not coming on this trip, so [I] get to do a little bit more of the team attack as well, but I’ll be assisting him with those bits of the attack when it comes to November and beyond.” Ireland’s three tour matches against the Pumas, Western Force and the Cheetahs will be broadcast on the IRFU’s new streaming platform IrishRugby+, a sports innovation project with Enterprise Ireland and the Cork-based company, Wiistream. IrishRugby+ will stream selected games free from the men’s and women’s Energia All-Ireland Leagues (AIL) as well as carry additional games such as the upcoming Emerging Ireland tour.

Title: US Bitcoin ETFs secure 5-day inflow streak as BlackRock rakes in $184 million

Share this article US-listed spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have notched their fifth consecutive day of positive performance, collectively taking in approximately $106 million on Wednesday. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) led with around $184 million in net inflows, according to data tracked by Farside Investors. On Wednesday, Bitwise’s Bitcoin ETF (BITB) added around $2 million in new capital. In contrast, Fidelity’s Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) and ARK Invest/21Shares’s Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) faced outflows of approximately $33 million and $47 million, respectively. Other competing Bitcoin ETFs, including the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), saw zero flows. Since GBTC was converted into an ETF, investors have withdrawn over $20 billion from the fund. However, massive outflows, which were observed after the conversion, have subsided in recent weeks. As GBTC’s outflow slows down and capital flows to other funds, especially BlackRock’s IBIT, the group of US spot Bitcoin funds has experienced sustained inflows for five consecutive trading days. These ETFs have attracted about $ 246 million in net inflows so far this week. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Title: Ethereum ETF impacted by SEC’s delayed decision – Here’s how
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/ethereum-etf-impacted-by-secs-delayed-decision-heres-how/
Time Published: 2024-09-26T01:30:11Z
Full Content:
Why did the SEC delay its decision on the Ethereum ETF listing? The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has extended its timeline for reviewing Nasdaq’s proposal to list and trade options on BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum [ETH] Trust (ETHA). Initially set for a decision by the 26th of September, the SEC has now postponed its ruling until the 10th of November. In a statement released on the 24th of September, the agency explained that the delay would provide additional time to evaluate the potential impact of this listing on market stability and ensure a thorough review of its implications for the broader financial landscape. The press release added, “The Commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action on the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change.” Under Section 19(b)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act, the SEC has the authority to delay its decision on proposals for up to 90 days. This extension provides the regulator with additional time to thoroughly assess potential market risks and stability before making a final ruling. By doing so, the SEC ensures a comprehensive review of any implications the decision may have on the broader financial landscape. In a separate development, the U.S. SEC has also deferred its decision on NYSE American’s proposal to list and trade options for Bitwise’s spot Ethereum ETFs, including the Grayscale Ethereum Trust and Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust. The deadline for this decision has been pushed to 11th November. In a seemingly contrasting move, the SEC recently approved Nasdaq’s request to list and trade options for BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin [BTC] ETF. On the 20th of September, the SEC officially greenlit options trading for the iShares Bitcoin Trust, which will trade under the ticker symbol IBIT. According to Nasdaq, these options will be available for trading under the same conditions and regulations as other ETF options, further expanding the investment opportunities surrounding Bitcoin. That being said, Ethereum ETFs have experienced a significant outflow since their launch, with a cumulative outflow of $624.4 million, largely driven by Grayscale’s Ether ETF (ETHE). The outflows have been particularly notable in recent weeks, with the 23rd of September marking the largest net outflow since July, as $79 million was withdrawn. Grayscale’s ETHE led this decline, seeing a staggering $80.6 million outflow in a single day, the largest since spot Ether ETFs debuted earlier this year. Despite occasional inflows, the overall trend remains one of heavy withdrawals from these funds.

Though a flood of capital into new spot Bitcoin ETFs pushed the price of BTC to a new all-time high in March, just two months after ETFs were approved in the U.S., the price should be much higher today with all those billions flowing into the market, befuddled Bitcoin buyers say. Coinbase—the U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange that serves as custodian for most Bitcoin ETFs, including BlackRock—must not actually be buying the Bitcoin requested by these funds, and instead merely issuing “IOUs,” or “paper” Bitcoin, these critics say. The unsubstantiated rumors echoed throughout social media over the last few months, and eventually became loud enough that Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong addressed the concerns on X, formerly known as Twitter. “Not sure what this is all about [to be honest],” he said last week. “All ETF mints and burns we process are ultimately settled on-chain.” Just two days later, however, BlackRock filed an amendment to its ETF registration with the SEC which now requires Coinbase to release Bitcoin much quicker to the asset manager, within 12 hours of notice, when BlackRock customers buy shares of its Bitcoin ETF product. Critics latched onto the update as evidence that their worries were not unfounded. Baldilocks here. Not sure what this is all about TBH. All ETF mints and burns we process are ultimately settled onchain. Institutional clients have trade financing and OTC options before trades are settled onchain. This is the norm for all our institutional clients. All funds… — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) September 14, 2024 But it’s all hogwash, says Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. “I’ve been tracking [the ETF] industry for 20 years, and there’s never been a case of this stuff not being with the custodian,” he told Decrypt. “First of all, it’d be illegal.” The idea that an ETF issuer or its custodian may not actually hold the underlying asset isn’t new. As Balchunas pointed out on X, it’s a worry that some gold investors have shared about gold ETFs for years. pic.twitter.com/u6lupDrOgs — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) September 16, 2024 An ETF is a way for investors to gain exposure to an asset, like gold or Bitcoin, without actually holding the asset themselves. With Bitcoin ETFs, for example, investors buy shares in BlackRock’s fund, and BlackRock then buys a corresponding amount of Bitcoin and stores it on Coinbase. There are trade-offs, though, and the added convenience requires an element of trust—and risk. Skeptical Bitcoiners would rather see on-chain receipts than receive assurances. The idea that Coinbase may be issuing paper Bitcoin to BlackRock dates back to at least May, when the pseudonymous trader “Tyler Durden,” who holds a sizable audience on X, began the charge. “Blackrock can take as much Bitcoin as they want from Coinbase and the transaction is recorded off chain,” he tweeted. The post currently has 1.6 million views. Earlier this month, music producer and crypto trader MartyParty fanned the flames, claiming that the price of Bitcoin is not moving upwards despite BlackRock “buying all the Bitcoin.” “Scam of the century,” he wrote. Balchunas dismissed the claims as a “conspiracy theory.” “This isn’t like FTX, where you just throw up an exchange out of nowhere, and some buffoon is running it from a Bahama penthouse,” he told Decrypt. “[BlackRock] is a serious company which has dozens of lawyers. They’re not gonna jeopardize their hard won reputation, let alone get sued by all the investors,” he said. Balchunas yesterday confirmed on X that he had spoken with BlackRock to find out more. He said that the asset manager runs “its own blockchain node” and pulls the BTC balances from their wallet addresses to put on Coinbase Prime every night. He said the firm can show balances to clients if requested, but would never make them public as they could get hit with spam such as dusting (when crypto users send small quantities of Bitcoin to wallet addresses to track, taint, or de-anonymize them.) BlackRock declined to respond to Decrypt’s questions, instead pointing to an interview Robbie Mitchnick, the firm’s head of digital assets, gave Bloomberg on Tuesday. When asked about last week’s controversial filing regarding Coinbase, he said it was a “normal course update” and that “nothing of significance has changed.” A Coinbase spokesperson confirmed to Decrypt that the unsubstantiated rumors being pushed on X were just that and nothing more, adding that regulatory updates were normal. No conspiracies. Nothing of significance has changed. This is a normal course update. https://t.co/kAk0NQI1yV — Jaclyn Sales 🛡️ (@MsJaclynSales) September 25, 2024 BlackRock’s IBIT is the biggest and most successful of the ETFs now trading in the U.S. The fund currently holds 357,732 BTC, according to its website, worth around $22.6 billion.

Title: XRP Price Explosion Finally In The Cards as Grayscale XRP Trust Turns Game-Changer For XRP-Based ETF

Ripple’s XRP is on a massive uptrend, gaining 7.7% in the seven days. The gains come after the world’s largest digital asset manager, Grayscale, announced plans to launch the first XRP Trust in the US. According to Grayscale, the launch of the XRP Trust is the first step towards the digital asset manager launching an exchange-traded fund (ETF) for XRP. “We believe Grayscale XRP Trust provides investors with exposure to a blockchain solution that is potentially positioned to play a crucial role in optimizing legacy financial systems by streamlining cross-border payments,” said the head of product and research at Grayscale, Rayhaneh Sharif-Askary. The product will operate as a “closed-end” fund that will expose investors to XRP. The firm noted that the trust will be rolled out gradually in four phases, and an ETF is planned for later. Grayscale is the main force behind the approval of spot crypto ETFs in the US. Last year, the asset manager sued the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust to a spot ETF tracking BTC’s spot price. After Grayscale won the court case, Wall Street giants BlackRock and Fidelity launched their crypto ETFs. Grayscale’s Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs are also among the largest in the US. The launch of this product also comes amid uncertainty over whether the SEC might appeal a judge’s ruling that XRP secondary sales are not securities. As ZyCrypto reported, the Ripple legal team sought court approval to delay payment for the $125M settlement. The Grayscale XRP Trust will join the growing list of crypto funds managed by Grayscale. The crypto asset manager also offers trusts for other altcoins, including Avalanche and Solana. XRP price jumped by more than 8% after the development to trade at $0.58. Trading volumes also shot up by as high as 80% per CoinMarketCap. The news saw XRP reach the highest level since late August, outperforming the rest of the top ten largest cryptos by market capitalization. According to an analyst on X, XRP has formed a bullish ascending triangle, with a breakout possibly taking the prices to levels above $0.70. This could pave the way for a rally to $1, especially if the trust attracts institutional investors.

The Bitcoin creator is estimated to have 1.1 million BTC, 17% more than the Bitcoin ETFs' combined stash of 916,047 BTC stash as of Sept. 24. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have amassed more than 900,000 BTC since their launch and will soon surpass the 1.1 million BTC held in wallets believed to be owned by Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto. Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas recently shared a list of spot Bitcoin ETF holdings, highlighting their cumulative 916,047 BTC stash as of Sept. 24. He noted that the ETFs are close to surpassing the 1 million BTC threshold cumulatively and just 17% shy of surpassing Nakamoto’s estimated stash. At the current price of $63,622.03, reaching 1 million BTC equates to over $63.6 billion. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) holds the largest amount among the US-traded funds, with 358,080 BTC, while Grayscale’s ETFs, GBTC and Grayscale Mini Trust (BTC), collectively hold 258,671 BTC. Rounding out the top 3 is Fidelity’s ETF FBTC, which holds 184,490 BTC. Together, these three Bitcoin ETFs represent nearly 86% of the BTC held by 11 US-traded ETFs. Shaun Edmondson, author of the list shared by Balchunas, noted that Fidelity holds roughly 100,000 BTC as a custodian for MicroStrategy. However, those were not included in the report. Notably, BlackRock added nearly 530 BTC to its wallets over the past 24 hours, according to on-chain data. The last time the asset manager bought Bitcoin was one week ago, through a 273 BTC transfer from Coinbase Prime vaults. Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) reached $17.8 billion in total flows on Sept. 24, as per Farside Investors’ data. This new mark was reached after four consecutive days of inflows, which totaled roughly $391 million. Fidelity’s FBTC led the charge by registering $117.7 million in positive flows. BlackRock’s IBIT followed closely with $110.4 million in inflows, despite not registering activity in two out of the four last trading days. The significant amount is then due to nearly $99 million in cash flowing to IBIT yesterday. ARK 21Shares’ ARKB wrapped up the list of Bitcoin ETFs with over $100 million in inflows, showing $103.1 million in positive net flows in four trading days.

Title: Tucker Carlson Bizarrely Claims Alex Jones is ‘Vindicated on Everything’

SEARCH The right-wing figures appear to be as buddy-buddy as ever, with Alex Jones telling Tucker Carlson on stage Tuesday, “I gotta say, I love you.” Breaking News Reporter Tucker Carlson’s embracing of the right-wing fringes reached a new extreme Tuesday after he welcomed the infamous, mass-shooting-denying conspiracist Alex Jones on stage with him as part of his speaking tour. Carlson, addressing a crowd of paying attendees in Pennsylvania, sung Jones’ praises and said he was “proud” to be alongside the 50-year-old Infowars founder who he said has been “vindicated on everything.” Carlson, 55, went as far as calling the far-right provocateur “the most extraordinary person” he’d ever met. That’s a sharp contrast from Carlson’s comments about Jones in Jan. 2012, when he said Jones, who was then peddling Sept. 11 attacks conspiracies, “freaks me out.” Carlson’s glowing statements about Jones on Tuesday is sure to enrage the families of Sandy Hook victims, who lost their elementary-aged loved ones in a horrific mass slaying in 2012 that Jones repeatedly claimed was a hoax carried out by crisis actors. Jones didn’t just keep his cooky beliefs to himself, unfortunately. He led a smear campaign against the grieving parents of victims, which led to incessant harassment in what was likely the lowest moment of their lives. That hateful conduct is what has Jones on the hook for $1.4 billion as part of a pair of defamation judgements against him in Texas and Connecticut. Those judgements also appear to be killing off InfoWars as we know it. A bankruptcy court said Tuesday it would auction off the assets of Infowars’ parent company, which will see it sell off everything from lighting fixtures to Jones’ dubious vitamin and supplement store. All of that money will then be directed to the families impacted by his lies. With Jones’ personal outlet for spilling his rage now in its final days, he might find a new platform at Carlson’s side. He already sat down for an interview with Carlson in June and certainly appeared buddy-buddy with him again on Tuesday, telling the former network news host in his intro, “I gotta say, I love you.” Jones went on to speak with his typical fiery rhetoric, declaring that if Donald Trump is elected again, “all of us, together, are going to lift the curse off of this country and we’re going to send the globalists to prison.” Jones added that he could “feel the strength in this auditorium” on Tuesday night. “It is amazing to meet all these great people,” Jones said, “whether they’re Black, white, old, young, to see the electricity in people’s eyes that are populist and that are Americans and that love God and that love children and love freedom and hate tyranny.” Carlson interrupted Jones shortly after, saying: “It just makes me laugh. Alex Jones, so controversial. Love God, love America, love freedom. Oh, you’re so radical!” Jones then took back the spotlight, using it to again rail against “globalists.” “I’m for the war, peacefully with information, against the globalists,” he said. “The real war is here with the globalists and [George] Soros and [Barack] Obama and the New World Order and [investment firm] BlackRock. They’ve declared war on us and we accept the challenge. We’re taking the country back.” New York magazine reported that a journalist in attendance spotted more Jones merchandise, like his slogan-filled shirts, than they saw Carlson-branded merch, which was actually being sold in the arena. The far-right activist Jack Posobiec also spoke Tuesday, but New York reported that he was significantly upstaged by the presence of Jones, who was introduced just after him. “Jones came out to a roaring crowd, all on their feet with phones in hand,” the magazine reported, adding that “every single line was an applause line, and the crowd got to the end of Jones’s catchphrases before he did.” “If they want a fight,” Jones began at point, “you better believe they got one!” the screaming crowd answered for him. New York reported that Tuesday’s stage was designed for a panel-style talk, but “it soon became clear that the rest of the night would belong to Jones.” “Once he locked in, howling into the middle distance in front of him, there was no interrupting or restraining him short of a blow dart,” it added.

Title: Railway fired by fresh ambition as they look forward to new campaign

The IRFU’s decision to play the women’s Energia All-Ireland League final at the Aviva Stadium for the first time last April as part of a double header was thoroughly vindicated as UL Bohemians and Railway Union served up an entertaining 13-try feast. Rejuvenated under new head coach Fiona Hayes, the Limerick club’s 48-38 win secured their 14th title and capped off a brilliant season by completing the double, having also beaten Railway 34-12 in the All-Ireland Cup final. No team will be more determined to dethrone UL Bohs than Railway, who finished a point behind the Limerick club in the 16-game regular season after avenging a 10-7 defeat at Annacotty in November with a 43-22 win in Park Avenue a fortnight before the final. “Bohs deserved to win on the day,” said Railway captain and outside entre Niamh Byrne, a try scorer on league final day, who also saw the bigger picture. “But it was a high-scoring game which went down to the last few minutes so it was a good advertisement. It was actually very exciting to be a part of, if disappointing on our side. There’s always a loser but a great day. Everything aligned perfectly. We’ll look to go again but we’ll remember that one.” Railway have shaken up their coaching ticket, with Mike South promoted to head coach, while Irish internationals Ailsa Hughes and Lindsay Peat will take on key player/coach roles with the backs and forwards. A well-run and closely knit club, Byrne believes the shake-up should be fairly seamless. Railway have a tough start on Saturday at home to Old Belvedere, the only other team to beat them last season when finishing third in the final standings. Tullow make their competitive debut in Division One at home to Wicklow while UL Bohs begin the defence of their title away to Blackrock, the second most successful side in the tournament’s history. ‘Rock won their sixth title two years ago by beating Railway in the final and finished fourth last season. Hot on the heels of those opening day contests, UL Bohs and Railway meet in a reprise of last season’s final on the UL 4G pitch in round two on Saturday week, so meaning the return fixture is again in the penultimate round next March. “We have a very competitive but good rivalry,” says Byrne of last season’s final pairing. “It’s the first fixture we look for in the calendar. It’s always a competitive match but, outside of it, we all get on very well and there’s good friendships there.” The improvement in the Under-18 interpros means there is more scope for changes in personnel and, for example, Galwegians, who host Ballincollig at Crowley Park on Saturday, will take encouragement from an infusion of young players who helped make Connacht very competitive in the senior interpros. “It’s getting more competitive each year and now we’ll see who comes quickly out of the blocks,” says Byrne. A relatively new force in the women’s club game, Railway were champions either side of the pandemic in 2019 and 2022 before losing the last two finals. “Obviously our main goal would be to get into that Aviva final and hopefully make it our day there. But equally, we have a lot of new people this season and hopefully [we can] lay the foundations for the next few years.” With the upturn in the fortunes of the Ireland women’s team, who play their first WXV1 game against world champions New Zealand in Vancouver on Sunday (3am Monday Irish time), Byrne says: “There’s more people aware of women’s rugby. With every year it’s growing and there’s more people backing us; supporters, the IRFU, sponsors and I think women’s rugby in Ireland is building to be something.” Women’s Division One (All matches Saturday at 5pm): Blackrock College v UL Bohemian, Stradbrook; Galwegians v Ballincollig, Crowley Park; Railway Union v Old Belvedere, Willow Lodge; Suttonians v Cooke, JJ McDowell Memorial Ground; Tullow v Wicklow, The Black Gates.
