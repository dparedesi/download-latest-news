U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has again put China at the center of U.S. priorities in the Western Hemisphere, one day after calling the world power a threat to the Panama Canal PANAMA CITY -- U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth focused again on China's presence in the Western Hemisphere Wednesday, one day after calling the world power a threat to the Panama Canal. Speaking at a regional security conference, Hegseth said that China-based companies were controlling land and critical infrastructure in strategic sectors. “China’s military has too large of a presence in the Western Hemisphere,” Hegseth said. “Make no mistake, Beijing is investing and operating in this region for military advantage and unfair economic gain.” He called on the region’s governments to work together to deter China and address threats posed by transnational drug cartels and mass immigration. Hegseth was speaking a day after meeting Panama's President José Raúl Mulino and touring the Panama Canal. The two countries agreed to step up security coordination and appeared to say they would work toward a way to pay back fees that U.S. warships pay to pass through the Panama Canal. The visit comes amid tensions over U.S. President Donald Trump’s repeated assertions that the U.S. is being overcharged to use the Panama Canal and that China has influence over its operations — allegations that Panama has denied. Shortly after Hegseth and Mulino met, the Chinese Embassy in Panama criticized the U.S. government in a statement on X, saying Washington had used “blackmail” to further its own interests and that who Panama carries out business with is a “sovereign decision of Panama ... and something the U.S. doesn’t have the right to interfere in.” On Wednesday, Hegseth said, “I don’t know anything about blackmail." The concern about China's influence over the waterway was provoked by Hong Kong-based consortium CK Hutchison holding a 25-year lease on ports at either end of the canal. The Panamanian government announced that the lease was being audited and late Monday concluded that there were irregularities, which CK Hutchison denied in a statement Wednesday. CK Hutchison has already announced that it would be selling its controlling stake in the ports to a consortium including BlackRock Inc., effectively putting the ports under American control once the sale is complete. Later Wednesday, Hegseth said that he would sign an agreement with Panama concerning the security and operation of the Panama Canal that would allow U.S. warships to “sail first and free.” The fact that the U.S. has a treaty obligation to protect the canal, but also had to pay to move its warships between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans had been one of the Trump administration’s complaints. Panama's Canal Affairs Minister José Ramón Icaza, said the two governments would look for a mechanism to repay the fees from U.S. warships to use the canal. He said annually they had paid on average $5 million to $7 million. The canal generated about $2.4 billion for the government in the last fiscal year, he said. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: XRP ETF Launch Impresses Even In Bear Market, Says Analyst

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Teucrium’s newly launched 2x XRP ETF on the New York Stocks Exchange recorded $5.43 million in turnover during its first day of trading on April 8, despite XRP prices hitting a five-month low. The ETF, trading under the ticker XXRP, achieved this milestone as cryptocurrency markets faced widespread selling pressure. Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas called the performance “very respectable” given the current bearish market conditions. According to market data, XRP’s price dropped to $1.61 on Monday, marking its lowest point in five months. The price briefly recovered to over $1.87 on Tuesday before falling again to $1.69 by evening. Even with these unstable price movements, Teucrium moved forward with its ETF launch, aiming to give investors a way to profit from price swings in either direction. $XXRP (2x XRP ETF) saw $5mil in volume on Day One, very respectable, esp considering the mkt conditions. That puts it in approx top 5% of new ETF launches, and about 4x what the 2x Solana ETF $SOLT did (altho both 200x less than King IBIT). pic.twitter.com/u3QQq5yuHv — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) April 8, 2025 Based on reports from Bloomberg’s Balchunas, the XXRP ETF’s first-day trading volume was about four times higher than what Solana’s similar 2x ETF saw on its launch day. This performance puts Teucrium’s product in the top 5% of all new ETF launches. However, the $5.43 million figure still pales in comparison to BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF debut, which saw trading volume roughly 200 times larger. The altcoin community has responded positively to the ETF launch, especially considering the harsh market conditions. Data shows that 137,000 traders faced liquidations in the 24 hours surrounding the launch, with total losses exceeding $413 million across cryptocurrency markets. Some XRP supporters have suggested that while XXRP’s volume was much smaller than BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF (IBIT), a potential spot ETF (which some have dubbed “IXRP”) could provide stronger competition. Unlike spot ETFs that directly hold the underlying asset, Teucrium’s XXRP does not invest directly in XRP tokens. Instead, it’s designed to deliver twice the daily performance of XRP’s price movements, which amplifies both gains and losses for investors. Community figure Crypto Eri warned about the ETF’s built-in risk factors, noting that even if XRP’s price stays flat, volatility alone could cause significant losses. For example, if XRP experiences 25% volatility, XXRP holders could see a 6% loss. With 70% volatility, those losses could balloon to 40%. The launch comes as more than 10 asset managers have filed applications with the SEC for spot XRP ETFs. Major firms like Grayscale and Franklin Templeton have submitted applications, though BlackRock has not yet expressed interest in launching an XRP-specific ETF product.

By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. They say journalists never truly clock out. But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Atkins will succeed former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who, under the Biden administration, attracted the ire of crypto leaders by suing or investigating almost every major company in the industry for alleged violations of securities laws. The incoming SEC chair is all but certain to have a far different approach to crypto. Atkins, who previously served as an SEC commissioner under President George W. Bush, recently told senators that a top concern of his chairmanship will be providing “a firm regulatory foundation for digital assets through a rational, coherent, and principled approach.” Atkins himself holds up to a $5 million stake in a crypto investment firm where he serves as a limited partner. Until February, he held between $250,000 and $500,000 in equity in the crypto custodian Anchorage Digital, and the same amount in call options in Securitize, a BlackRock-backed blockchain firm where he also held a board seat, according to ethics disclosures. In Atkins’ absence, the SEC has barrelled ahead with pro-crypto policies. The agency’s two Republican commissioners—Acting Chair Mark Uyeda and Commissioner Hester Peirce—have moved to dismiss almost every major lawsuit against a crypto company. They’ve also issued statements effectively exempting meme coins, crypto mining, and stablecoins from securities regulation. The SEC is currently operating with just three commissioners—Uyeda, Peirce, and Democratic commissioner Caroline Crenshaw—as opposed to the full five. Crenshaw supported former chair Gensler’s crypto lawsuits during the Biden administration, and her nomination to the SEC was so intensely protested by the industry in December that Senate Democrats abandoned a push to renominate her. The SEC’s rules state that no more than three commissioners from the same political party can serve at the same time to “ensure that the Commission remains non-partisan.” Thus, Trump would ordinarily appoint two Democrats to fill empty seats at the agency. But the president has recently shown an unorthodox resistance to such long-held Washington norms. Last month, he fired two Democrats serving on the Federal Trade Commission and a Democrat on the National Labor Relations Board. Until now, a key 1930s Supreme Court ruling has protected commissioners on such independent agencies—the SEC included—from being fired without cause. Experts believe Trump could be angling to have that long-standing precedent overturned by the Supreme Court’s current conservative majority. Lawsuits on the subject have already been filed.

Filings on Wednesday show that the regulator approved trading options for BlackRock's iShares Ethereum Trust, along with the Bitwise Ethereum ETF and Grayscale's Ethereum Trust and Ethereum Mini Trust. The Ethereum ETFs allow investors to gain exposure to digital assets without the need to buy and store the virtual coin themselves. Options give investors the right to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price by a set date. Crypto options are popular because they allow investors to gain exposure to the performance of an asset, rather than just investing in it. Traders are able to bet on the future price of a digital coin, and the market for doing so is much bigger than the spot one. Options trading on ETFs adds more liquidity to the crypto investment space, experts previously told Decrypt. The regulator last year approved Ethereum ETFs just months after giving their Bitcoin counterparts the green light. The SEC also approved options trading on the Bitcoin funds. Cryptocurrency ETFs—managed by the likes of BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale—give investors from top hedge funds to retail investors the ability to invest in the cryptocurrency in an easy and regulated way. Though the Bitcoin funds have received enormous inflows, pushing the price of the biggest cryptocurrency by market cap to new highs, the Ethereum funds haven't drawn the same kind of demand. A number of top asset managers are now hoping to get approval from the regulator to list other ETFs giving investors exposure to altcoins like Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin. CoinGecko data shows that Ethereum is now trading for $1,675 per coin after surging by more than 14% over the last 24 hours. It's one of the biggest gainers on the day amid a markets upswing triggered by President Trump's decision to pause "reciprocal" trade tariffs on most nations.

The first batch of approvals allow ETHA and FETH to offer up to 25,000 options contracts. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved proposals from Nasdaq and Cboe to list and trade options on spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) managed by BlackRock and Fidelity, according to April 9 filings. The orders were granted for the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) and the Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH) following a review process that included amendments, public comments, and regulatory justification for new product listings under Section 19(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Both filings approved options with American-style exercise and physical settlement. The approved contracts will adhere to existing listing rules applicable to ETF options, including margin, strike intervals, series expiration cycles, and minimum trading increments. The ETHA and FETH options will be subject to a 25,000-contract position and exercise limit per market side, just as the options for Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs were approved last year. Nasdaq and Cboe emphasized the conservative nature of the 25,000-contract cap, which was derived from a comparative analysis with other ETFs and commodity-based trusts. Additionally, Nasdaq noted that the notional risk of a maximum position in ETHA would represent less than 0.03% of the Ethereum market’s capitalization and below 4.4% of the trust’s outstanding shares. Cboe compared the proposed limits to those set for Bitcoin-based ETFs and similarly structured commodity products. The approvals follow a precedent set for spot Bitcoin ETF options, which received SEC authorization on Sept. 23, 2024, and began trading in November 2024. As happened last year, options trading requirements from other issuers are likely to be approved, with trading starting in the same week as ETHA and FETH.

Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has bounced back over $80,000 per bitcoin, though well down from a January peak of almost $110,000 that’s seen $1.3 trillion wiped from the price of ethereum, XRP and the combined crypto market as fears of a looming “crisis scenario” swirl. Now, after Treasury secretary Scott Bessent issues a surprise bitcoin prediction, the BlackRock-powered, crypto-based tokenisation of assets has been forecast to grow "exponentially” from $600 billion to $19 trillion by 2033.

More pushing the bitcoin price and wide crypto market including ethereum and XRP higher. “For financial institutions, tokenisation is no longer a side project. It is increasingly emerging as a strategic path and a likely next step in the evolution of finance,” the report, written by analysts with XRP developer Ripple and global management consulting company Boston Consulting Group and titled “Approaching the tokenisation tipping point," read. Wall Street giants, led by the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock, have embraced tokenisation in recent years. "Global adoption is poised to grow exponentially," Yue Hong Zhang, managing director and partner at BCG Hong Kong, wrote in the report. “With the recent growth of real-world assets, people outside the crypto industry are increasingly asking about the potential of tokenised assets to address historically under-penetrated segments."

More Wall Street giants—lifting ethereum, XRP and other major cryptocurrencies. BlackRock, which manages over $10 trillion globally on behalf of clients, led the campaign last year to bring a fully-fledged spot bitcoin ETF to the U.S., winning approval for its IBIT and a fleet of other spot bitcoin ETFs in January. In July, BlackRock's chief executive Larry Fink said he had been "wrong" about bitcoin when he'd previously dismissed it as "an index of money laundering," admitting bitcoin is "digital gold” and a "legitimate" financial instrument. The arrival of a fleet of spot bitcoin ETFs on Wall Street was the first step in what Fink branded a digital "revolution" when he revealed his crypto ambitions for BlackRock in 2023—which includes a radical new, blockchain-based alternative to the U.S. dollar. Fink said he believes the crypto-based tokenisation of assets on blockchains will revolutionize Wall Street, as everything—from stock markets, pre-IPO stocks, hedge funds, infrastructure projects, commodities, alternate investment instruments and private credit—becomes tokenised. "At BlackRock, we believe that tokenisation has the potential to drive a significant transformation in capital markets infrastructure," BlackRock’s global head of strategic ecosystem partnerships Joseph Chalom told Fortune last year.

Title: ​​Hegseth says Panama agreed to allow US warships to travel 'first and free' through canal

Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth says the US and Panama have made moves to strengthen ties and remove ‘China's influence’ from canal. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced Wednesday that U.S. and Panama officials would sign a "framework" agreement allowing U.S. warships to travel "first and free" through the Panama Canal. Hegseth said the two countries had already signed a memorandum of understanding on security cooperation and that they would finalize a document guaranteeing U.S. warships and auxiliary vessels priority, toll-free passage through the canal. When Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited Panama earlier this year, the State Department claimed it had secured a deal for the free passage of U.S. warships. But Panamanian President José Raúl Mulino denied any such agreement had been reached. "I completely reject that statement," Mulino said at the time. The Panama Canal Authority also said it had "not made any adjustments" to its fee structure. US, PANAMA ‘TAKING BACK’ CANAL FROM ‘CHINA’S INFLUENCE,' SAYS HEGSETH Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said China's military presence is "too large" in Panama. (Reuters/Aris Martinez) Earlier Wednesday, Hegseth warned that China’s military presence in the Western Hemisphere is "too large" as he visited Panama to meet with the nation's officials, visit U.S. troops and tour the canal ports. "Make no mistake, Beijing is investing and operating in this region for military advantage and unfair economic gain," Hegseth said in brief remarks to the press. "China's military has too large of a presence in the Western Hemisphere. They operate military facilities and ground stations that extend their reach into space. They exploit natural resources and land to fuel China's global military ambitions. China's factory fishing fleets are stealing food from our nations and from our people." He added that war with China is "not inevitable," and the U.S. does not seek war in any form. "Together, we must prevent war by robustly and vigorously deterring China’s threats in this hemisphere." To strengthen military ties with Panama and reassert influence over the canal, the U.S. will deploy the USNS Comfort, a Navy hospital ship, to the region. Hegseth vowed Tuesday that the U.S. will "take back" the Panama Canal from Chinese influence, pointing to port operations controlled by Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison. The secretary later said Wednesday that he and Panamanian officials would be signing an agreement that U.S. warships would travel "first and free" through the Panama Canal. TRUMP, HEGSETH REVEAL WHOPPING FIGURE THEY WANT FOR THE NEXT PENTAGON BUDGET Hegseth said Panama had agreed to allow U.S. warships to travel "first and free" through the canal. (Reuters/Enea Lebrun/File Photo) Last month the conglomerate agreed to a $19 billion deal to sell a group of 43 ports, including two in Panama, to U.S.-based BlackRock, Trump hailed the agreement, seen as a solution to his complaints that the canal was owned by China, but now that deal may fall apart. China has criticized the deal, opening up antitrust probes, and a Panamanian official has accused CK Hutchison of failing to properly renew its contract in 2021 and owing the country $300 million. After meeting with Mulino, Hegseth said Tuesday the U.S. will not allow China to threaten the canal's operation. "To this end, the United States and Panama have done more in recent weeks to strengthen our defense and security cooperation than we have in decades," he said. US, PANAMA ‘TAKING BACK’ CANAL FROM ‘CHINA'S INFLUENCE,’ SAYS HEGSETH Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth visits Miraflores locks with Panama Canal Authority Administrator Ricaurte Vasquez, and Adm. Alvin Holsey, head of the U.S. Southern Command. (Reuters/Aris Martinez ) Hegseth alluded to the ports owned by CK Hutchison. "China-based companies continue to control critical infrastructure in the canal area," he said. "That gives China the potential to conduct surveillance activities across Panama. This makes Panama and the United States less secure, less prosperous and less sovereign. And as President Donald Trump has pointed out, that situation is not acceptable." CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Chinese embassy in Panama hit back: "The U.S. has carried out a sensationalistic campaign about the ‘theoretical Chinese threat’ in an attempt to sabotage Chinese-Panamanian cooperation, which is all just rooted in the United States' own geopolitical interests." The war of words in Panama comes as China and the U.S. are now locked in a trade war, where Trump slapped Chinese goods with a total 104% tariff. China retaliated with 84% tariffs on U.S. goods.

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Mumbai: BlackRock, Inc. has made a big bet on the Adani Group, snapping up nearly a third of about $1 billion bonds sold by a group promoter entity, marking the first investment in any Adani entity by the world's largest asset manager. Apart from BlackRock, at least five other top global funds also bought the bonds privately placed by Renew Exim, an Adani Group promoter firm, two people aware of the matter said. “BlackRock is one of these investors. There are a few European investors as well," one of the two people said on the condition of anonymity, adding that most of the money raised will be utilized for the acquisition of ITD Cementation, while the rest will be used for funding the capex plans of other Adani group firms. Renew Exim DMCC, in October, had proposed to acquire 46.64% in ITD Cementation India, and buy an additional 26% through an open offer. Also read | Adani Green is weighing its biggest equity sale ever BlackRock's vote of confidence comes in the backdrop of ongoing litigation in a US court against the conglomerate's promoters over a case of alleged bribery. Adani Green's promoters were indicted in the US last year, over charges that they have denied as baseless and vowed to contest. "Renew Exim will hold 67.45% in ITD Cementation after the completion of the open offer. The total amount for the acquisition of ITD Cementation would cost around ₹5,000 crore. The proceeds from the latest bond placement by the promoter entity will be used for the expansion of other group companies," said the first person. Adani Group has planned a ₹5 trillion capex over the next five years. About 85% of this will be for utilities such as green energy, other power generation projects, power transmission projects, airports and ports. The remaining 15% is planned to be spent on metals, materials and mining. A 31 March report by Mint said Adani Group, whose renewable arm is planning to mobilize a total of $4-5 billion across FY26, has stated in its recent roadshows that it has deep access to diverse pools of capital, securing large amounts for long durations. However, as foreign investors started demanding interest rates of 7-9% for the group's bonds following the bribery charges, Adani Group has been attempting to restore the confidence of foreign investors, and preferring to raise capital in the domestic market only. Also read | Adani Group adopts strategy to diversify its debt after Hindenburg crisis The two persons said the private placement issue size is a little under $1 billion and the bond tenure is over three years, which is considered to be medium-term debt papers, reflecting confidence among investors in the group's growth prospects. "Adani stakeholders are seeing this as a major move as the entry of BlackRock is now seen as the global investors are not much worried about the ongoing DoJ case," said the first person. On Wednesday, the ITD Cementation open offer was concluded, with 20.81% shares being tendered by the public. On 30 January, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) had approved Adani's proposal to acquire a majority stake in ITD Cementation, an engineering and construction company undertaking heavy civil, infrastructure and engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) business and operating in India and overseas. "This acquisition marks a significant milestone as it enhances the overall projects execution capabilities and strategically positioning Adani portfolio companies to capitalize on the burgeoning opportunities in the country's booming infrastructure sector," said the second person. On 3 March, Adani Green Energy refinanced its maiden construction facility, having outstanding debt of $1.06 billion with long-term financing, the company said in a regulatory filing on Monday. It was the first major fund raise by Adani Group since the DoJ indicted its top executives. Also read | Can Adani Wilmar’s FMCG bet deliver long-term gains? Shares of Adani Green ended 1.72% lower at ₹860.75 on Thursday, while those of flagship Adani Enterprises fell 2.11% to ₹2237.45.

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. Markets around the world have plunged as the trade war escalates. Photo / Getty Images THREE KEY FACTS Don’t check your KiwiSaver balance or share portfolios. We are watching the United States and China hurtling towards an all-out trade war, leaving us all diving for foxholes hoping to avoid the shrapnel. This is brinkmanship at its worst. On Donald Trump’s so-called “Liberation Day”, when the President unveiled US tariffs on the world, he originally unveiled a 34% additional duty on Chinese goods. But after China retaliated with its own 34% counter-tariff, Trump added another 50% duty – bringing the additional rate on Chinese products to 104%. China vowed to “fight to the end”. Markets around the world plunged, fund managers were fidgety, corporate valuations were crunched, and countries called the White House. Apple, the world’s largest company by market capitalisation, desperately scrambled to shift production of the iPhone from China to India. Country club conservatives and several business leaders, some of whom were vocal Trump supporters last year, are now speaking out against tariffs. Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, who endorsed Trump’s 2024 presidential run, said on social media this is not what he voted for. “My bad,” he posted. The boss of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, Larry Fink, raised the risk of a US recession. Ken Griffin, the billionaire who runs hedge-fund firm Citadel, called the tariffs a “huge policy mistake”. Kiwi billionaire and Zuru co-founder Nick Mowbray said penalising trade doesn’t bring jobs back — it just raises prices and slows innovation. “Sad to see what is happening,” he wrote on LinkedIn. Money talks. While New Zealand is not facing comparatively high tariffs, our biggest trading partner is China. The Asia region, including Australia, accounts for about 70% of our trade. “All of these factors create risk for the New Zealand economy, just as we have been gathering positive momentum and recovering from a period of high inflation and interest rates ... put simply, the past week’s global developments make our recovery harder,” Finance Minister Nicola Willis said. In the face of this chaos and a historically significant event, the Government’s plan, like long-term investors, is to keep calm and carry on. However, it will be a bumpy road to recovery as we try to navigate the economic uncertainty. Yesterday, more trouble brewed in Maga paradise. Trump’s senior trade adviser Peter Navarro and Elon Musk engaged in a spat over the tariff carnage, with Musk calling Navarro “truly a moron” and “dumber than a sack of bricks”. “Boys will be boys,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said. Yes, puerile behaviour, not that she would’ve intended her comment to be read that way. Unfortunately for us, Musk may be right but also wrong. Navarro is possibly just one in a room full of powerful morons. Sign up to the Daily H, a free newsletter curated by our editors and delivered straight to your inbox every weekday.

Join the leading maritime news network FILE PHOTO: A ship sails near the Balboa Port after Hong Kong's CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd 0001.HK agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a BlackRock Inc-backed consortium, amid pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to curb China's influence in the region, Panama City, Panama, March 4, 2025. REUTERS/Enea Lebrun/File Photo April 9 (Reuters) – A company controlled by Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison has invested $1.7 billion in two ports near the Panama Canal, it said on Wednesday, surpassing the amount required under its contract, which is being audited by Panamanian authorities. Panama Ports Company (PPC), in which CK Hutchison owns a 90% stake, had its 25-year operating concession for the Balboa and Cristobal ports renewed in 2021. The Panamanian government launched an audit of the contract in January, potentially complicating a high-profile deal by a group led by U.S. investment firm BlackRock for most of CK Hutchison’s global port business, including the two ports. Comptroller General Anel Flores said this week that the audit had already found that Panama “left $1.3 billion on the table” due to tax incentives and benefits granted to CK Hutchison. CK Hutchison has denied any wrongdoing or irregularities, and on Wednesday it outlined how it had gone beyond the financial conditions of the agreement. It said its investments in Panama had surpassed not only the $50 million required in the original concession contract signed in 1997, but they had also eclipsed a $1 billion requirement contained in a 2005 addendum. “During the term of the concession, PPC has paid the State $668 million … far exceeding the contributions of any other port operator in Panama,” it said. Tax exemptions granted to PPC by the government were “precisely the same tax exemptions granted to all other port operators in Panama,” it added. “Panama Ports Company continues to call for respectful coordination and consultation to protect the concession,” the company said. CK Hutchison, the telecoms-to-retail conglomerate owned by Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing, has found itself caught in a highly politicized tug of war since U.S. President Donald Trump returned to office. Trump has repeatedly threatened to take control of the Panama Canal due to the presence of Chinese and Hong Kong firms in the Central American country’s maritime business and praised the $22.8 billion BlackRock deal. Chinese authorities have criticized it however, and China’s market regulator is launching an antitrust review of it. Panama’s contract audit is nearing completion, state comptroller Flores said this week. Since February, Panama’s Supreme Court and the attorney general’s office have also started reviews of the concession and the conditions of its renewal.

A subsidiary of a Hong Kong conglomerate, which is embroiled in U.S.-China tensions over its Panama Canal port assets has denied allegations that it had failed to pay about $1.2 billion to the Central American country HONG KONG -- A subsidiary of a Hong Kong conglomerate that is embroiled in U.S.-China tensions over its Panama Canal port assets denied allegations Wednesday that it had failed to pay about $1.2 billion to the Central American country. Panama’s comptroller authority announced on Monday that an audit of Panama Ports Company found irregularities in the renewal of a 25-year port concession in the interoceanic canal. The authority's accusations came the same day as U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's arrival in the country to participate in a security conference. The Panama Ports Company, or PPC, defended itself in a statement Wednesday, saying it had made significant investments that exceeded $1.69 billion, surpassing the $50 million investment required under the original concession contract signed in 1997. That was also more than another $1 billion agreed to in an addendum. It said the investments were confirmed by the country's comptroller general in 2020 after a thorough audit. The company said any statement about what it should have paid under the original concession contract must take into account the respective addenda, which was validly executed and approved by law. “To express the opposite, as it unfortunately has been the case, not only distorts the reality of the existing legal relationship between PPC and the State under the concession contract and its addenda, but also contradicts the State’s own acts over the years,” it said, referring to Panama. It said any claim that the company has failed to pay about $1.2 billion to Panama is false and that it believes “respect for legal certainty gives companies and investors the certainty that Panama is a safe country in which to invest.” Panama Ports Company, under Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings, won a concession to operate the ports of Balboa, in the Pacific, and Cristobal, in the Atlantic, beginning in 1997 and it was renewed in 2021 for 25 more years. CK Hutchison is controlled by the family of Li Ka-shing, the southern Chinese city’s richest man. U.S. President Donald Trump has alleged Chinese interference with the critical shipping lane’s operations — accusations that Panamanian authorities have denied. Hegseth said Tuesday that the U.S. will not allow China or any other country to threaten the canal’s operation. Last month, CK Hutchison announced a tentative deal to sell its canal port assets to a consortium that includes U.S. investment firm BlackRock Inc., which pleased Trump but angered Beijing. China’s Hong Kong affairs offices have posted scathing commentaries from a local state-backed media outlet over the tentative deal. Chinese anti-monopoly authorities said they would review the business agreement, a state-backed news outlet reported last month. It is unclear how the geopolitical pressure might affect the deal. But analysts have warned that a cancellation could cause the Trump administration to impose more sanctions or restrictions on businesses and individuals in Hong Kong and mainland China. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: Tokenized Funds' Rapid Growth Comes With Red Flags: Moody's
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/04/09/tokenized-funds-rapid-growth-comes-with-red-flags-moody-s
Time Published: 2025-04-09T15:54:53Z

Tokenization of funds is booming, but their rapid rise comes with serious risks that investors should not overlook, credit agency Moody’s Ratings said in a Wednesday report. Several major financial institutions, including BlackRock and Franklin Templeton, have made their mark in the world of tokenization and inspired others to follow the latest trend. For example, tokenized money market funds grew roughly 350% in a year to a market capitalization of $5.2 billion, per rwa.xyz data. "When assessing tokenized funds, investors have to weigh not only the benefits of accessibility and transparency, but also the risks tied to the underlying technology, security vulnerabilities, scalability limitations and evolving regulations,” said Cristiano Ventricelli, VP-senior analyst at Moody’s Ratings. At the forefront of these risks is the limited experience of many fund managers in the still-developing tokenization market, Moody’s noted. With small teams and short track records, operators could face key-man risk where too much depends on a few individuals: If a crucial executive leaves or governance structures are thin, the stability of the fund could be shaken, the report said. Moody’s urged fund teams to distribute responsibilities and shore up risk management practices. Blockchain disruptions, again resulting from the novelty of the technology, poses another risk. While smart contracts offer operational efficiencies like automating fund operations, they remain susceptible to coding flaws or malicious attacks, the report noted. Using public, permissionless blockchains increases accessibility but also raises exposure to potential exploits, it added. Moody’s recommended keeping off-chain backups and conducting rigorous smart contract audits to guard against disruptions. Redemption mechanisms, which let investors cash out their holdings, are another fragile link. The report encouraged tokenized funds to allow redemptions in both stablecoins and fiat currency. This dual approach helps cushion against events like stablecoin depegs or blockchain outages. Lastly, tokenized funds operate across jurisdictions with varying regulations, and this patchwork increases the risk that investor claims could face legal hurdles, the report said. While some funds use structures designed to give token holders direct claims on the underlying assets, enforceability still depends on local laws and the strength of fund documentation, the report added.

Title: CK Hutchison Rejects Accusations Over Panama Ports Payments

(Bloomberg) -- CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd rejected accusations it failed to pay about 1.2 billion balboas ($1.2 billion) to the Panamanian state over the concession contract to run the two key ports in the Central American country. The accusations are “absolutely contrary to reality.” and the company has invested more than 1.695 billion balboas, Panama Ports Co., a unit of the Hong Kong-listed conglomerate, said in a statement. That surpasses the 50 million balboas required under the original concession contract and the 1 billion balboas agreed under the addendum to operate the Balboa and Cristobal port terminals. Panama’s comptroller general confirmed this in 2020 after a thorough audit process, the company said. “We firmly believe that respect for legal certainty gives companies and investors the certainty that Panama is a safe country in which to invest,” Panama Ports said in the statement. “PPC continues to call for respectful coordination and consultation to protect the concession that has provided high-quality services for the benefit of Panama and the world.” The port operator’s response came after Panama’s top auditor accused the company of wrongdoing, including failing to obtain required approvals for a contract extension in 2021 and owing millions in dues. The accusation ratchets up pressure on Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-Shing’s CK Hutchison and its precarious position in the middle of a US-China spat. While the firm is set to make $19 billion in cash proceeds from its deal to sell its ports business, the agreement has enraged Beijing after US President Donald Trump touted it as reclaiming the Panama Canal. The canal, used mainly by the US and China, became a geopolitical lightning rod after Trump vowed to retake it. In a news conference Tuesday, US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth pointed to ports operated by CK Hutchison on either end of the trade route as potential threats to US and Panamanian interests.

Title: Hegseth says China’s military presence in western hemisphere is ‘too large’

By JUAN ZAMORANO, Associated Press PANAMA CITY (AP) — U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth focused again on China’s presence in the Western Hemisphere Wednesday, one day after calling the world power a threat to the Panama Canal. Speaking at a regional security conference, Hegseth said that China-based companies were controlling land and critical infrastructure in strategic sectors. “China’s military has too large of a presence in the Western Hemisphere,” Hegseth said. “Make no mistake, Beijing is investing and operating in this region for military advantage and unfair economic gain.” He called on the region’s governments to work together to deter China and address threats posed by transnational drug cartels and mass immigration. Hegseth was speaking a day after meeting Panama’s President José Raúl Mulino and touring the Panama Canal. The two countries agreed to step up security coordination and appeared to say they would work toward a way to pay back fees that U.S. warships pay to pass through the Panama Canal. The visit comes amid tensions over U.S. President Donald Trump’s repeated assertions that the U.S. is being overcharged to use the Panama Canal and that China has influence over its operations — allegations that Panama has denied. Shortly after Hegseth and Mulino met, the Chinese Embassy in Panama criticized the U.S. government in a statement on X, saying Washington had used “blackmail” to further its own interests and that who Panama carries out business with is a “sovereign decision of Panama … and something the U.S. doesn’t have the right to interfere in.” On Wednesday, Hegseth said, “I don’t know anything about blackmail.” The concern about China’s influence over the waterway was provoked by Hong Kong-based consortium CK Hutchison holding a 25-year lease on ports at either end of the canal. The Panamanian government announced that the lease was being audited and late Monday concluded that there were irregularities, which CK Hutchison denied in a statement Wednesday. CK Hutchison has already announced that it would be selling its controlling stake in the ports to a consortium including BlackRock Inc., effectively putting the ports under American control once the sale is complete. Later Wednesday, Hegseth said that he would sign an agreement with Panama concerning the security and operation of the Panama Canal that would allow U.S. warships to “sail first and free.” The fact that the U.S. has a treaty obligation to protect the canal, but also had to pay to move its warships between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans had been one of the Trump administration’s complaints. Panama’s Canal Affairs Minister José Ramón Icaza, said the two governments would look for a mechanism to repay the fees from U.S. warships to use the canal. He said annually they had paid on average $5 million to $7 million. The canal generated about $2.4 billion for the government in the last fiscal year, he said.

Title: Billionaires Speak Out On Trump Tariffs: Jamie Dimon Says Recession ‘Likely’ As Elon Musk And Others Slam Tariffs As ‘Mistake’

President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs took effect Wednesday over the concerns of many of the nation’s billionaires, as even some longtime supporters of the president—including Elon Musk—have expressed concern about the tariffs and their impact on the economy. Elon Musk arrives for the inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump in the U.S. Capitol ... More Rotunda on January 20 in Washington, DC. Jamie Dimon: The JPMorganChase CEO told Fox Business on Wednesday he thinks a recession is a “likely outcome” of Trump’s tariffs—though he said he’s right now taking a “calm view” of the financial situation, “But I think it could get worse if we don’t make some progress here”—after Dimon expressed concerns in his annual letter to shareholders Monday morning, saying they “will likely increase inflation and are causing many to consider a greater probability of a recession.” Elon Musk: The Tesla CEO shared a video early Monday of economist Milton Friedman touting free trade and the benefits of importing goods and reportedly lobbied Trump personally not to impose the tariffs, The Washington Post reported Monday. He’s also been sparring with Trump’s top trade adviser Peter Navarro for praising tariffs—most recently saying Tuesday Navarro is a “moron” who’s “dumber than a sack of bricks”—and Musk’s brother (and Tesla board member) Kimbal Musk has criticized the tariffs as a “permanent tax” on Americans. Bill Ackman: The hedge fund manager is a longtime Trump supporter but has repeatedly spoken out against the president’s tariffs, calling Tuesday for the White House to issue a 30, 60 or 90-day pause on the tariffs “to enable negotiations to be completed without a major global economic disruption” and saying Wednesday morning the financial chaos Trump’s tariffs have sparked are “not the markers of successful policy” and “many small businesses will go bankrupt” if they’re not paused soon. Ken Griffin: The Citadel founder—and major Republican donor—said at an event Monday that Trump’s tariffs are a “huge policy mistake,” with Bloomberg reporting he urged audience members to lobby Trump to step back on the tariffs and said he’s “really afraid of [the U.S.] abdicating our role of leadership for the free world.” Daniel Loeb: While Loeb said in February he thought Trump’s initial tariffs on Mexico and Canada wouldn’t harm the stock market, the hedge fund manager has spoken out against Trump’s more sweeping policy, sharing a post Monday that noted the stock market chaos is “all in the head of 1 person. Who can change his mind at any time”—writing, “Exactly”—and sharing criticism of the tariffs by billionaire Ken Griffin and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. Larry Fink: The BlackRock CEO suggested at the Economic Club of New York Monday that “the economy is weakening as we speak” and the market could fall another 20% from where it is now as a result of Trump’s tariffs, CNBC reports. Fink suggested the U.S. is “probably in a recession right now,” but he still expressed some optimism about the economy’s long-term outlook, saying, “In the long run, this is actually more of a buying opportunity than a selling opportunity” and “the vitality of the United States will persist.” Joe Lonsdale: The Palantir cofounder said on X he has some concerns about the tariffs even though he understands where “some” of the Trump administration’s thinking “is coming from,” and shared a post on tariffs from Viahart founder Molton Hart early Monday, saying Hart’s argument that the “tariffs are structured in the wrong way” by taxing finished products and components at the same rate “reflects a lot of my key concerns about how the tariffs could be done better.” Ken Langone: The Home Depot cofounder and GOP megadonor told the Financial Times he believes Trump has “been poorly advised by his advisers about this trade situation” and criticized how the tariffs were calculated—saying, “I don’t understand the goddamn formula”—telling the FT it would have been “more manageable and certainly more constructive” for the Trump administration to impose baseline 10% tariffs on foreign imports before starting negotiations. Ray Dalio: Dalio, who founded the world’s biggest hedge fund firm, Bridgewater Associates, wrote Monday the tariffs are based on a broader “breakdown of the major monetary, political, and geopolitical orders.” He’s still expressed concern about Trump’s tariffs and their “practicality,” however, telling CNBC on Tuesday that while he “agree[s] with the problem” the tariffs are aimed at fixing, “I am very concerned about the solution.” Stanley Druckenmiller: Longtime hedge fund manager Stanley Druckenmiller expressed some optimism about tariffs in an interview with CNBC, referring to them as the “lesser of two evils” versus an income tax—though an unverified social media account believed to belong to Druckenmiller responded to a clip of his interview Sunday, arguing he “do[es] not support tariffs exceeding 10%.” Ken Fisher: The Fisher Investments chairman attacked Trump’s tariffs Monday, saying on X the tariff plan is “stupid, wrong, arrogantly extreme, ignorant trade-wise and addressing a non-problem with misguided tools,” predicting it “will fade and fail.” Thomas Peterffy: Contrary to many other billionaires, the Interactive Brokers founder has fully embraced Trump’s tariffs, telling Forbes on Tuesday he “think[s] it gives an opportunity to many entrepreneurs to gear up for producing and inventing either the same things that foreign countries sell us at cheap prices, or proper substitutes for them,” and claiming any price hikes will affect “plastic sh-t from China that is not absolutely necessary for people to have.” More than $10 billion. That’s how much Trump’s top 10 billionaire donors lost in the stock market on Thursday alone, as stocks plunged in the immediate aftermath of Trump’s Wednesday tariff announcement. That’s only a fraction of the $270 billion in total that was wiped off the net worths of the world’s billionaires on Thursday, Forbes calculated, with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon chief Jeff Bezos, Oracle founder Larry Ellison and Musk among those who were the hardest hit. Musk’s brother Kimbal Musk called Trump “the most high tax American President in generations” on Monday. “Through his tariff strategy, Trump has implemented a structural, permanent tax on the American consumer,” the Tesla shareholder said on X. Peterffy criticized his fellow Trump-friendly billionaires who have spoken out against the president’s tariffs, telling Forbes, “I think that they are short term, greedy, looking after their own pockets.” Trump has dug his heels in on his tariffs and repeatedly doubled down in support of them, even as they’ve spurred chaos in the markets. “BE COOL! Everything is going to work out well. The USA will be bigger and better than ever before!” Trump said Wednesday morning on Truth Social after his tariffs took effect. The president staunchly defended his tariffs to reporters in the Oval Office on Monday, saying they are “the only chance our country will have to reset the table” in terms of the U.S.’ trade with other countries, and that while other presidents wouldn’t be willing to impose such controversial tariffs, “I don’t mind going through it, because I see a beautiful picture at the end.” Trump’s tariffs have also garnered criticism from a number of non-billionaires who have typically been sympathetic to the president. Barstool Sports owner Dave Portnoy has suggested he’s lost up to 15% of his net worth as a result of the stock market plunge from Trump’s tariffs and said “everything’s in the s—-ter” because of the president’s policy—but also has continued to back the president, saying Trump is a “smart guy” even as he dubbed Monday’s stock market plunge “Orange Monday.” “I’m gonna roll with [Trump] Trump has suggested he’s open to negotiating with other countries on their tariffs, saying Monday that discussions with other countries would begin “immediately” and telling reporters he’s open to reaching “fair deals” with other countries that put “America first.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has also said Trump will negotiate with other countries—likely starting with Japan—but has suggested those negotiations may take a while, telling Fox Business on Monday that all the countries approaching the Trump administration about making deals means “it’s going to be a busy April, May, maybe into June.” The White House denied reports Monday suggesting the administration was considering a 90-day pause, however, decrying the rumor as “fake news,” and Trump said Monday he’s “not looking at” pausing the tariffs unilaterally. Congress could also undo Trump’s tariffs, and bipartisan legislation has been introduced that would require any tariffs the president wants to impose to be approved by Congress. That legislation remains a longshot to pass as of now and House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has reportedly urged House Republicans to back Trump’s policy—though some GOP lawmakers are already backing the legislation, and more could follow suit if Trump’s tariffs continue to wreak economic havoc. A Florida-based stationery company is also challenging Trump’s authority to enact tariffs in court—with potentially another major legal challenge on the way this week from business groups—though it remains to be seen how those will play out. Trump announced his sweeping tariff policy during a “Liberation Day” event Wednesday, levying tariffs of 10% and up on imports from nearly all foreign countries—even uninhabited ones. The tariffs fulfill a longtime promise by the president to impose sweeping tariffs in order to restore manufacturing to the U.S. and punish other countries for purportedly unfair trade practices, which Trump has pushed despite economists long warning that doing so would raise prices for U.S. consumers and harm the economy. Billionaires’ criticism of Trump’s tariffs comes after dozens of them backed the president in the November election. More than 50 billionaires expressed support for Trump and billionaires funneled millions into his campaign, even as the now-president made sweeping tariffs a signature plank of his platform.

Title: ‘G20’ Review: A Butt-Kicking President Viola Davis Takes on AI-Obsessed Cryptobros in Throwback Action Outing

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA Enterprise and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply. Some details might be lacking in Patricia Riggen’s (“The 33,” “Lemonade Mouth”) Prime Video action outing “G20”. Like, hey, what political party does our red-dressed heroine president (billed by some as a “warmonger”) but also, notably, a woman of color, obsessed with a plan to help failing African countries, identify as? But for audiences willing to put this and other queries to the side, the streaming feature delivers. Mostly, “G20” has two major points in its favor, right out of the gate: a super-fun premise for an action film (what if money-mad mercenaries seized the 20 most powerful leaders of the world and demanded some really insane shit?) and a star both so good and so classy that it never feels as if she’s punching below her weight class. Star and producer Viola Davis brings gravitas and charisma to every role, and so while she’s thrilling to watch in the non-action moments afforded to her President Danielle Sutton, there is something special about seeing her, oh, choke a bad guy out with the barrel of a submachine gun. She can have it all! Related Stories Pam Grier: ‘Blaxploitation’ Originated as Term Meant to Deter Black Audiences from Box Office, Was ‘Political Marketing Ploy’ The Academy Finally Announces a Stunt Design Category for the 100th Oscars Not that it’s been easy. When we first meet President Sutton, she’s preparing for her first G20 Summit and juggling some relatable family problems. Her husband Derek (Anthony Anderson) is devoted — we soon learn Danielle rocketed to fame as a young soldier, captured in an iconic photo while saving a small child during an attack on Fallujah; Derek was the medic who healed her after. Her kids, though, aren’t as easy. Smart Serena (Marsai Martin) is almost 18 and itching to be her own person. Typical teen problems made all the worse by her mom’s job, while younger brother Demetrius (Christopher Farrar) is just trying to ride this whole thing out. When Danielle drags the entire family to Cape Town for the summit, we know something messy is afoot, mostly thanks to a jittery opening sequence involving obvious baddies (like “The Boys” star Antony Starr) and a fat crypto wallet, two things that don’t seem like they’ll mesh well with the prez. She’s got some aces up her sleeve, though, like her own hyper-motivated personality (with some refreshing physical fitness to boot) and devoted Secret Service agent Manny (Ramon Rodriguez, the film’s sneaky breakout). But she’s got stuff on the line, too, like her Together Plan, which hinges on bringing digital currency to African farmers that could really benefit from the ease of such tech-forward banking. What could go wrong? Even before the action kicks in, EGOT winner Davis finds texture and emotion in the smallest of scenes. The set of her jaw during a tense family dinner sequence, the way she prepares to face a crowd in an elevator, even the second she pauses in the middle of a busy ballroom to wonder about the probability of success of that much-heralded Together Plan, Davis makes every scene count. That’s the pleasure of casting such a star in a genre that can be intensely rewarding if treated with respect. And that’s before she shoves a baddie’s face into a hot grill, a “Sudden Death”-esque moment that will delight the pickiest of action fans. Davis hasn’t been shy about her intent with the film: She wanted to see if she could star in an old-school action outing, the kind of thing that Bruce Willis or Sigourney Weaver (two names the star and producer threw out during a Tuesday night introduction to the film) might have taken on in the ’80s or ’90s. With that in mind, she absolutely delivers. Yet, fans of those sorts of films might get antsy, waiting for the action to really heat up. Stay patient, it does, and what a treat to see not only a woman kick ass, but to do it while wearing sensible sneakers and a well-placed pair of Spanx. Once the 20 world leaders (and staff, spouses, and security) all turn up for a pre-summit cocktail party, Rutledge (Starr) and his band of AI-obsessed cryptobros move in. Hired as private security for the event (no wonder Danielle sniffed at the news that the BlackRock-esque group was running the show in Cape Town), they’ve got the run of the place, and the kind of shaky plan and awkward motivations traditional to the genre. All you need to know: They’re mad at the world leaders, they want everyone to yank their money from the stock market and put it into crypto (good God), and they’re more than happy to utilize deepfakes to sell their plan to the world. And, no, they never saw President Sutton coming. When their initial attack proves to be so messy (a constantly shaking camera keeps both the audience and the baddies unclear of what’s really happening) that Danielle and some other heavy hitters can sneak away, their aims become fixated on her. Trawling through the bowels of the luxury resort, the prez has some allies with her (Manny, the Chinese First Lady, the spunky head of the International Monetary Fund) and some duds (Douglas Hodge as the British Prime Minister, cast here as a moron with some wonderful comic relief). Their mission? Live or something? Ultimately, it results in a series of hand-to-hand battles and lobby-set shoot-outs that are remarkable in how unremarkable they would have been three decades ago. We used to get movies like this once a week! We used to be a proper country! Still, the script (from Caitlin Parrish & Erica Weiss, plus Noah Miller & Logan Miller) can get bogged down with too much extra stuff. While a subplot involving the president’s family works — it adds to her character, and will also obviously tie into her primary plot, that’s clear the moment we realize Serena is a would-be hacker — other bits and bobs get lost along the way. Consider smarmy tech bad guy Bousquet, who disappears throughout the film (fine, acceptable), or Danielle’s close friend and treasury head Joanna (Elizabeth Marvel) who does the same (criminal, for many reasons). And while Antony Starr makes for a good baddie, the unevenness of his performance rankles. Sure, he’s fully bonkers by the final act, but that sort of unhinged energy would have been more welcome much earlier. You’ve taken the twenty most important people on Earth hostage, can’t you have a touch more fun with that? That’s the big ask of such films: tucking majorly worrying world events (a stock market crash? in this economy?) alongside ass-kicking adventure. Davis, at least, understands the assignment. “G20” will start streaming globally on Prime Video on Thursday, April 10.

Title: This Bitcoin Hedge Fund Is Taking Treasuries Companies Global: Blockspace

This Bitcoin-focused hedge fund outperformed bitcoin last year. 210k Capital, the hedge fund for UTXO Management, was the fifth best performing single major hedge fund in 2024 according to HFR. It returned 164% net of fees in 2024. UTXO Management is the investing arm of BTC Inc., of Bitcoin Magazine and Bitcoin Conference fame. This article first appeared on Blockspace Media, the leading Bitcoin industry publication dedicated to covering Bitcoin tech, markets, mining, and ordinals. Get Blockspace articles directly in your inbox by clicking here. Single manager hedge funds are run by one entity, versus multi-manager or fund-to-fund hedge funds, which have multiple portfolio managers. In HFR’s recap of its 2024 Global Hedge Fund Industry Report Q4 2024, the research firm revealed that cryptocurrency-focused hedge funds were “the leading area of overall [hedge fund] industry performance.” HFR’s index for cryptocurrency funds returned 59.81% in 2024. UTXO Management’s banner 2024 performance puts it in conversation with leading hedge funds that focus on traditional assets and industries. And it has bitcoin to thank for that – or, more directly, bitcoin companies. UTXO Management’s Co-founder and Chief Investment Officer, Tyler Evans, said that the fund’s 2024 returns chiefly stemmed from its investment in bitcoin strategy companies, principally Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) and Metaplanet. “Over the last 12 months, we went very hard into the bitcoin treasury-play thesis as as we really saw it play out with what Saylor is doing, and the opportunity to really globalize it…So we did that pretty heavily in 2024, with both Strategy as well as Metaplanet out of Japan, where we were the first bitcoin investors in the company,” Evans told Blockspace. He said that the hedge fund holds 80% of its portfolio in bitcoin equities, which were a “big factor that drove [210k Capital’s] out-performance in 2024. A portion of that 80% includes public bitcoin miners, but the real money makers have been Metaplanet and Strategy, the latter of which 210k Capital held since the early days of its bitcoin strategy. These companies, Evans explained, offer a novel form of securitized bitcoin exposure that makes it easier for everything from institutional firms to IRAs to pension funds to hold bitcoin-adjacent assets. As a result, “the investable landscape has grown significantly over the last few years,” he said, opening the door to “registered investment advisors, wealth managers, funds, and sophisticated family offices.” This marks a shift from the fund’s early days when it courted self-made, high-net worth individuals who were typically more active investors managing their own portfolio to more passive investors whom manage pools of capital. “We saw the demand for institutional capital to get exposure to Bitcoin and the role that these Treasury companies can serve is securitizing bitcoins for fixed income investors, the insurance funds, or the mutual funds,” said Evans. “These institutional allocators have very defined mandates of what types of instruments that they can invest in. And that's really the beauty of the whole playbook is securitizing bitcoin in these different formats that make it so that institutional allocators can invest into it.” Bitcoin ETFs, first approved in January 2024, offer liquidity as well. With BlackRock on board – not to mention it recommending a 5% allocation to bitcoin – Evans said the Overton Window for how investors view bitcoin is shifting. So much so that the Wisconsin Teacher’s pension now holds bitcoin ETFs, as does the Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund. The only thing harder than winning the championship is defending your title. And with bitcoin down year-to-date, it raises the question: can 210k Capital top 2024? Evans said that the fund hedges its positions with a number of auctions, but it’s also still “very bullish” on bitcoin in 2025. It’s even more bullish on exporting Michael Saylor’s corporate bitcoin treasury Strategy strategy to other financial markets. “We think that there's an opportunity for a bitcoin treasury company in every tier-one financial market globally,” he said. UTXO Management had a large hand in standing up Metaplanet’s bitcoin treasury in Japan. Tyler Evans served as an independent director and UTXO Management partner Dylan Leclair acting as Metaplanet’s head of bitcoin strategy. Another UTXO portfolio company, The Smarter Web Company, is set to IPO on the Aquis Exchange in the U.K. this week. Read: England’s Metaplanet? The Smarter Web Company eyes UK IPO with bitcoin strategy Public bitcoin treasury companies like Metaplanet give traditional investors access to bitcoin where other vehicles are limited. In Japan, for example, there are no native bitcoin ETFs, and access to American ones is limited. This – plus Japan’s low interest rates and a lower capital gains tax on equities cryptocurrencies – make it ripe for Metaplanet to reap market share, Evans believes. UTXO has its eye on multiple markets to incubate bitcoin treasury companies, including Latin America, Central America, the Middle East, Australia, Thailand, and Vietnam. Some of these are already in the works “at various stages of maturity,” Evans teased, with some in the IPO planning stage and others raising capital. “Our inbound deal flow of seasoned entrepreneurs who want to bring it to their own local market is growing massively,” he said.

Title: Trump Tariffs Seen from Contradictory Angles. Prof. Patrick Bond

Donald Trump’s paleo-conservative, isolationist attack on global capitalist trade is already having formidable impacts. If tariff levels and targeted announced on ‘Liberation Day,’ April 2, are sustained, a full-blown economic catastrophe could result, perhaps reminiscent of 1930s-scale Make America Great Depression Again. The worst danger: national elites in victim countries will be divided-and-conquered. Even South African President Cyril Ramaphosa – who 15 months ago had bravely challenged Washington’s ‘rule of law’ fakery by authorising Pretoria’s challenge to Israel’s genocide at the International Court of Justice – apparently feels compelled to dream up utterly irrational deals for Trump, ideally sealed over a game of golf. Ramaphosa’s spokesperson told the NY Times last month that Ramaphosa may soon offer to U.S. Big Oil firms generous offshore leases for methane gas exploration and extraction, in spite of enormous climate damage, Shell Oil’s courtroom setbacks, and widespread shoreline protests. He’s not alone; more than 50 world leaders have ‘reached out’ to Washington in an obsequious manner, leading Trump to brag, “They are coming to the table. They want to talk but there’s no talk unless they pay us a lot of money on a yearly basis.” Even before the April 2 announcements, Trump imposed 25% universal tariffs on imports of steel and aluminium (effective March 12) and on cars (and auto parts) (March 26), radically lowering demand for what are traditionally the three main South African exports to the U.S. under the tariff-free Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). According to Business Leadership South Africa’s Busisiwe Mavuso: “Trump has made it clear that he wants concessions from each country if he is going to reduce or drop the tariffs. He emphasised that the tariffs put the U.S. in a position of power in the series of bilateral negotiations that are to come. Given the transactional nature of US politics, we have to think hard on what is commercially available and viable for all parties. The U.S. has exempted many of our key metal exports, including platinum, gold, manganese, copper, zinc and nickel, because these are considered critical to the U.S. economy.” Setting aside the exemptions on raw materials, which makes the whole operation appear as a neo-colonial resource grab that simultaneously stifles poor countries’ manufacturing sectors, what would justify these highest tariffs on U.S. imports in 130 years? Trump’s chief economic advisor (and investment banker) Stephen Miran, who holds a Harvard doctorate in economics, explained the underlying theory in a November 2024 report, celebrating the potential for a: “generational change in the international trade and financial systems. The root of the economic imbalances lies in persistent dollar overvaluation that prevents the balancing of international trade… Tariffs provide revenue, and if offset by currency adjustments, present minimal inflationary or otherwise adverse side effects, consistent with the experience in 2018-2019. While currency offset can inhibit adjustments to trade flows, it suggests that tariffs are ultimately financed by the tariffed nation, whose real purchasing power and wealth decline…” This is wishful thinking, most experts believe. Currency adjustments are hard to predict but the dollar’s decline on April 2-3 (about 1%) is already being offset by its ‘safe haven’ status, providing a quick valuation bounce-back. The reason: international financial volatility always encourages global footloose capital’s short-term flight to dollar-denominated assets, no matter how irrational that may be in the medium term. U.S. consumer inflation will soar, it’s fair to predict. Already, those whose pensions have been invested in the world’s (admittedly way-overvalued) stock markets have suffered major losses, e.g. in South Africa and the U.S., more 10% on April 3-4 alone. As nervous money floods out of vulnerable countries, the interest rates investors demand to fund 10-year bonds are soaring, in South Africa’s case by 2.2%, from 8.9% at the end of January to a painful 11.1% in early April (at a time of long-term average inflation of 5%). And as a distributional matter, left economist Dean Baker of the Center for Economic Policy and Research points out, “Import taxes are highly regressive, meaning that tariffs will cost ordinary working people a much higher share of their income than for high income people. This is because working people tend to spend most or all of their income, while high income people save a large portion of their income. Also, working people are more likely to spend their money on the goods subject to tariffs, whereas higher income people spend more money on services.” Beyond Miran’s fantasies, five other narratives are generating anti-Trump ideologies that – without a coherent stitching together – risk splintering critics: 1. mainstream neoliberalism The corporate and state elites who in most countries typically back neo-liberal trade deregulation are now in shock, as their own personal share portfolios crash. The Economist summed up, “Trump’s mindless tariffs will cause economic havoc.” In alliance with market-friendly ‘bastard Keynesians‘ like Paul Krugman, the neoliberals are expressing utter disgust at Trump because precepts of free trade are being violated in the most primitive manner. The powers and legitimacy of the Geneva-based World Trade Organisation (WTO) to police tariffs and trade are being trampled by Trump – leaving the body’s defense to some of the world’s most aggrieved neoliberal forces, in Beijing. Because Trump is launching “economic nuclear war on every country,” even Bill Ackman – a strong supporter of the president and a billionaire fund manager – conceded, “we will severely damage our reputation with the rest of the world that will take years and potentially decades to rehabilitate.” Quite right. (This growing establishment hatred of Washington is extremely useful if progressives want to forge even brief alliances, e.g. to ‘Vote Trump off the G20 Island,’ a true Survivor approach which would be indisputably popular in the bloc’s capital cities, except for Buenos Aires and maybe Rome, and set the stage for the 2026 G20 not to be held in the U.S., but maybe jointly by Mexico and Canada instead, as should the 2026 soccer World Cup and 2028 Olympics.) 2. radical Keynesianism combined with dependency theory Both these approaches are highly critical of international trade, but not for the reasons Trump is. The last century’s leading British economist, John Maynard Keynes, at one point – in his 1933 Yale Review article – firmly advocated tariffs and other forms of protectionism, so as to support domestic industries and thus achieve much more balanced internal development: “let goods be homespun whenever it is reasonably and conveniently possible, and, above all, let finance be primarily national” (using tightened exchange controls). As for global economic regulation, Keynes’ last (unsuccessful) major project was to propose penalties for economies that ran trade surpluses: the ‘Bancor’ International Currency Union proposal at Bretton Woods in 1944. His objective was to use trade and currency controls to achieve self-correcting international economic stability, in the wake of a Great Depression and war caused in part by extreme commercial and financial volatility. From the Global South, a different critique of international trade and an even stronger advocacy of tariffs together aim to promote poor countries’ ‘delinking’ from dangerous international circuits of capital, and to protect infant manufacturing industries. Africa’s main contributor to this dependencia school was Egyptian political economist Samir Amin. He understood the differential labour values and ‘unequal ecological exchange’ (resource looting) that are embodied in South-to-North trade as benefiting transnational corporations, and causing Africa’s underdevelopment. Amin also criticised trade between impoverished countries and South Africa which – even after apartheid was defeated in 1994 – he viewed (until his death in 2018) as a malevolent capitalist power on the continent: “nothing has changed. South Africa’s sub-imperialist role has been reinforced, still dominated as it is by the Anglo-American mining monopolies.” Indeed AngloGold Ashanti and many similar Johannesburg firms have benefited from the South African National Defence Force’s ersatz quarter-century-long military presence in the eastern Congo. (Last November, these troops were recognised by the UN not for heroism, but as the peace-keeping force’s worst offenders for sexual exploitation, abuse and paternity lawsuits.) Pretoria’s troops were recently forced out of the DRC by invading Rwandan forces (and also lost battles in Northern Mozambique and the Central African Republic since 2013), but the critique of sub-imperial interests remains intact. 3. climate consciousness Opponents of ecocide – surely, all of us who aren’t climate denialists – regret the massive greenhouse gas emissions caused by excessive, often pointless international trade: 7%+ of all CO2 emanates from shipping and air transport, according to the International Transport Forum. And while the International Maritime Organisation has hosted a decade of talks about its members’ dirty bunker-fuel emissions – which for the sake of ‘polluter pays’ policy, should be costed at $1056/tonne (even the World Economic Forum admits) – these have been futile. The modest $150/tonne tax on shipping emissions demanded by increasingly-desperate Pacific and Caribbean small island states is this week being rejected by rich Western countries and also by an alliance centred on four BRICS members: Brazil, China, Indonesia and South Africa. Moreover, genuine ‘Just Transition’ plans are widely recognised as necessary to wean workers and affected communities off CO2-intensive export production, e.g. the West’s (highly flawed yet necessary) Just Energy Transition Partnerships and Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanisms, but these and other climate obligations Trump has simply walked away from. The Pan African Climate Justice Alliance had already called on the world to impose trade sanctions on the U.S. as a result, a call that now has much more purchase. Indeed, to that end, many would support a ‘degrowth‘ approach seeking to stabilise and indeed diminish much of the high-carbon industrial output exported by many economies into the U.S. Those include steel, aluminium and automobiles – now 25% tariff victims – due to the vast waste involved in rich-country consumption. And South Africa is one of the worst, with the ‘Energy Intensive Users Group‘ of 27 multinational corporate exporters guzzling more than 40% of the country’s scarce electricity but hiring only 4% of workers in the formal sector. 4. African nationalism African patriots logically perceive Trump’s hatred of the continent (full of ‘S-hole countries‘) as, in part, behind attacks on its trade-surplus countries. Tiny Lesotho was hit by Trump with the highest new tariff on April 2 mainly because of its $240 million trade surplus with the U.S.: mostly Levi’s and Wrangler jeans and diamond exports, whereas imports from the U.S. are indirect, as they first are cleared by customs in South Africa. Trump also imposed 40%+ tariffs on Madagascar and Mauritius, because of their trade surpluses. The context for the continent’s (and world’s) rising anti-Americanism is Trump and Pretoria-born Elon Musk’s halt to financial support for African healthcare (especially AIDS-related – which could lead to 6.3 million unnecessary deaths by 2029 – and maternal), climate (mitigating emissions, strengthening resilience and covering ‘loss & damage’ relief), renewable energy and vitally-needed emergency humanitarian food supplies. Some critics here suggest these cuts reflect Trump’s white supremacy, called out by Pretoria’s fired ambassador to Washington, amplified by the fiscal chainsaw wielded by Musk, against whom protest is rapidly rising. All this means Trump is discarding Washington’s soft power, which notwithstanding the vast destruction in the meantime, could ultimately be very useful for anti-imperialists (in contrast to last November’s internecine squabbling over a controversial National Endowment for Democracy conference held in Johannesburg). 5. Marxist political economy Readers of Das Kapital understand that capitalist crises and the ‘devaluation’ of ‘overaccumulated capital’ (e.g. deindustrialisation once businesses addicted to exports to the U.S. shut down) reflect the mode of production’s intrinsic contradictions. In reaction, capitalism often degenerates into inter-imperial and imperial/sub-imperial rivalries, generalised trade wars (often based on tit-for-tat tariffs) and stock market turbulence. The conclusion drawn is that eco-socialist planning of the global economy in the public and environmental interest, is the only route out. (Disclosure: that’s my main bias but I’ll travel a long way with advocates of positions 2-4 as well.) For those outside mainstream, neoliberal logic, can the latter four framings be fused together for not only a coherent analysis but also a clear political response? The danger of not having a strategy linking Keynesians, environmentalists, nationalists and anti-capitalists is four-fold: 1. under a beggar-thy-neighbour ‘reciprocal tariff’ trade war, we all face a new version of a 1930 Smoot-Hawley Act and then a 1930s-style Great Depression (which by the way, was an extremely constructive period for South African capitalism, which grew 8% per year as a result of import-substitution industrialisation); 2. recognising the durable power of U.S. economic imperialism, individual governments will go cap-in-hand to Trump to beg for a bit of relief, offering absurd concessions in the process such as Ramaphosa’s invitation to drill baby drill; 3. surplus countries will redirect already-produced (or in-production) manufactured goods and commodities away from the now shuttered U.S. market, flooding all other potential buyers, thus further deindustrialising South Africa – whose main anti-dumping measures applied by the International Trade Administration Commission are against various ultra-cheap imports from China; and Naturally the mainstream logic of ‘searching for new markets’ – now that the U.S. is closing its trade doors – won’t get at the root cause of the problem. That cause is sometimes termed ‘uneven and combined development,’ in which over the past 40 years, the global trading system became exceptionally volatile and generative of ever worsening inequalities (especially unequal ecological exchange), i.e., depleting, polluting and emitting against the interests of poor economies and natural environments. This extreme abuse of commercial power being exercised with a vengeance by Trump, no matter how self-destructive financial markets have judged his Liberation Day, is only the latest reflection of Western economic chaos. The world has suffered extreme uneven development after the recovery from early-1980s global recession, as ‘Washington Consensus’ liberalisation kicked in everywhere due to debt crises and IMF/World Bank squeezing, and especially via global commerce following the capture by nearly all governments’ policies by the World Trade Organisation after 1994. The limits of trade globalisation became clear in 2008 – the peak year of world trade/GDP until until 2022 – as did the limits of financialised economies in recent months, in the form of overvalued ‘Buffett Indicators‘ of stock market capitalisation, unprecedented debt loads, currency volatility and recognition of the $’s malevolence after two Fed-led ‘Quantitative Easings’ and interest rate manipulations, etc. The damage done to South Africa’s industrial economy was amongst the most severe, as we lost most labour-intensive industries – clothing, textiles, footwear, appliances, electronics, etc – which had driven the manufacturing/GDP ratio up to 24%, before the steady decline to less than 13% by the 2010s. So the challenge is reversing that imbalance – i.e. fighting against uneven and combined development – with progressive policies, not merely relying upon the programme of dissatisfied export-oriented capitalists. Here in South Africa, the de facto retraction of AGOA zero-tariff access for locally-made luxury cars, aluminium, steel, petrochems, vineyard products and plantation nuts and citrus reminds that the main losers are capital-intensive extractive industries, carbon-intensive smelters and super-exploitative plantations, all with mainly white ownership. From Washington, the imperialist Hudson Institute last month even recommended not cutting the tariff-free AGOA trade programme, since “The communities that benefit most from the AGOA largely support South Africa’s pro-American political parties.” In contrast to Trump’s paleo-con isolationism and to neoliberal trade promotion, the four historically-progressive ideologies of Keynesianism, environmental justice, African nationalism and eco-socialism represent countervailing views. Programmatically, to move in their direction can only be assessed once the dust settles a bit and the distinction between those national leaders who are either fighting or who are obsequious, becomes clear. So far, South Africa’s leaders, under threat of losing their Government of National Unity related to a budget dispute caused by excessive neoliberalism, are decidedly in the latter category. In contrast, the potential for China to guide the international fightback is not merely witnessed in its WTO complaint against Trump, quickly filed on April 4. The same day, Beijing’s central bank experimented with a much more rapid, blockchain-secured digital alternative to the dollar-denominated cross-border bank settlement and clearance system, with 10 regional and another six West Asian economies now reportedly able to avoid the Brussels-based SWIFT network, even if merely for cost and speed savings. There have been far too many false alarms and hyped hopes about de-dollarisation. If it began in earnest thanks to Trump’s misstep, we’d much more likely see the venal, volatile Bitcoin take over, as Blackrock CEO Larry Fink warns, than the renminbi. All this suggests a far more durable approach is needed, to get out from under Trump’s thumb and then the dollar’s domination, and then escape the tyranny of capital. A series of non-reformist reforms were offered to Democracy Now! by Indian radical economist Jayati Ghosh, worth mulling over for countries like South Africa, and all others, as a last word: “There’s a silver lining in this for developing countries, which is that for too long, for maybe three decades, we’ve been told that the only way we can develop is through export-led growth. And that’s really — it’s been unfortunate, because we have never seen giving our own workers a fair deal as a good option. We’ve always seen wages as a cost, not as a source of our own domestic demand and market. It’s now time to actually change, to shift gears, to think about different trading arrangements, more regional arrangements, looking at other developing countries as markets, looking at our own population as markets, and thinking about the things we can do to create sustainable production, that’s not ecologically damaging, that actually provides living wages and decent working conditions within our own countries.” (The University of Johannesburg Centre for Social Change will convene a webinar on Trump tariffs in the G20-from-below series on Tuesday, April 15, 3pm SA time, 9am Washington time, here: https://us02web.zoom.us/j/84736248638) * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Posted on 04/09/2025 5:26:37 AM PDT by Miami Rebel Global bond markets were gripped by volatility on Wednesday, as the rollout of U.S. President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs left investors scrambling to find safety as global equity markets resumed their sell-off. U.S. Treasurys sold off on Wednesday as a new wave of duties came into force and China announced fresh retaliatory action, with the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury last seen trading 12 basis points higher at '4.382% while the 2-year was 4 basis points higher at 3.768%. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions, as investors demand a lower price on the bond and a higher return on their loan to lend to governments that they see as riskier holdings. Across the Atlantic, longer-dated European government borrowing costs also rose. By 12:22 p.m. in London shortly after China’s announcement, the yield on French 10-year government bonds was 2 basis points higher, the Italian 10-year yield was up 6 basis points and the yield on British 10-year government bonds, known as gilts, was up 9 basis points. The 30-year gilt yield jumped nearly 23 basis points to a fresh 27-year high. Gilt yields are not only suffering spillover effects from the moves in Treasurys, but the gilt market is generally sensitive — relative to other high-grade bond markets — to catalysts that trigger yield rises given stretched margin calls from hedge funds, Diana Iovanel, senior markets economist at Capital Economics, told CNBC. “It’s not too surprising to see more volatility in gilts than in other [developed market] government bonds against the risk-negative and highly uncertain global backdrop. Beyond that, the U.K.‘s stretched fiscal picture is arguably testing investors’ tolerance already,” she added. Germany bucked the trend as its 10-year bund , seen as a benchmark for the euro zone, traded 2 basis points lower. Shorter-dated bonds in Europe meanwhile rose in value. The yields on 2-year government bonds in France, Italy and Britain were 9, 6, and 4 basis points lower, respectively. The yield on Germany’s 2-year bunds dropped 12 basis points. “One factor people are speculating about on Treasurys is around the ongoing theme of a move away from the U.S. dollar, of it becoming less trusted,” Ken Egan, senior director for sovereigns at credit rating analysis agency KBRA, told CNBC in a call on Wednesday. “If you follow that through, one way that could manifest is structural holders of debt, reserve managers in China, could move away from Treasurys in response to policy moves from the U.S.” Egan added that secondary investors also appeared to be taking a step back from U.S. Treasurys, typically seen as a traditional safe haven assets, given the volatile geopolitical climate. “Various forces are at odds, because you have inflationary concerns and a rapid repricing of Treasurys on those, but on the other side you have weak demand and growth, and more rate cuts being priced in,” he told CNBC. German bonds were out of sync with the long-dated market on Wednesday because it is being seen as an alternative safe haven play, as investors — still stunned by the scale of Trump’s actions — wait for more clarity, he said. Egan also noted that European bonds with shorter maturity terms were rising in value as they are more policy-sensitive and traders want to lock in returns now, as more global interest rate cuts are being priced in. “Traditionally you might have gone into the U.S. during a period of volatility, but this is a U.S. story. Germany is benefiting from a wider flight to quality. The country has already told the market what it’s going to do, there’s clarity about what its path will look like,” Egan added, referencing Berlin’s recent passing of a huge fiscal package across infrastructure, climate and defense. In a note on Wednesday, Freya Beamish, chief economist at TS Lombard, likened the spike in U.S. government borrowing costs to the U.K.’s 2022 “mini budget” crisis, which rocked the country’s pension funds and led to emergency market intervention by the Bank of England. “The really worrisome thing about negative supply shocks is that they push up inflation and destroy demand at the same time, destroying the hedging capacity of bonds for equities. They are capital destroyers,” she said. “The issue here is not who is right or wrong about the long-term effects of tariffs. It is about investor perceptions over the probability of these types of shocks. And once this narrative starts to be priced in, the risk is of financial accelerators kicking in, as happened in the UK with the LDI crisis.” Alex Brazier, global head of investment and portfolio solutions at BlackRock, told CNBC’s “Squawk Box Europe” on Wednesday that recent months had been a reminder for investors that “we’re in a new world.” “This is not a situation where a classic broad stock index, broad bond index, set-and-forget portfolio is ideal,” he said. “Looking at the fundamentals of the U.S. bond market here, we’ve got some technicals going on, we’ve got early signs of stress in the swap market, that bears closely watching.” Meanwhile, Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, told CNBC via email on Wednesday that some European government bond yields had moved upward despite rising expectations of interest rate cuts in the region. “This is likely to be because investors are selling out their positions in European bonds to buy U.S. Treasuries given that they are offering higher yields,” she said. “However, U.S. Treasury yields are falling back again, and the situation remains very fluid.” TOPICS: Business/Economy KEYWORDS: dollar Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.

Now there is little middle class left to care about things like investments and most are even happy to see the “rich” get soaked this way, as it literally has little impact on them being the “poor” working class. 3 posted on 04/09/2025 5:34:41 AM PDT by Skwor [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Vaduz With the GSR now at 100, Safer Haven = Silver. 4 posted on 04/09/2025 5:34:57 AM PDT by C210N (Mundus vult decipi, ergo decipiatur.)

Treasuries are going down because many people use those for their possible margin calls. And that is happening so they are selling their treasuries to cover their margins. This includes big companies and little people both. China and democrats are no doubt selling them to harm Trump too. 6 posted on 04/09/2025 5:56:11 AM PDT by Hattie [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Miami Rebel Selling off US bonds?

In a note on Wednesday, Freya Beamish, chief economist at TS Lombard, likened the spike in U.S. government borrowing costs to the U.K.’s 2022 “mini budget” crisis, which rocked the country’s pension funds and led to emergency market intervention by the Bank of England. “The really worrisome thing about negative supply shocks is that they push up inflation and destroy demand at the same time, destroying the hedging capacity of bonds for equities. They are capital destroyers,” she said. “The issue here is not who is right or wrong about the long-term effects of tariffs. It is about investor perceptions over the probability of these types of shocks. And once this narrative starts to be priced in, the risk is of financial accelerators kicking in, as happened in the UK with the LDI crisis.” Alex Brazier, global head of investment and portfolio solutions at BlackRock, told CNBC’s “Squawk Box Europe” on Wednesday that recent months had been a reminder for investors that “we’re in a new world.” “This is not a situation where a classic broad stock index, broad bond index, set-and-forget portfolio is ideal,” he said. “Looking at the fundamentals of the U.S. bond market here, we’ve got some technicals going on, we’ve got early signs of stress in the swap market, that bears closely watching.” Meanwhile, Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, told CNBC via email on Wednesday that some European government bond yields had moved upward despite rising expectations of interest rate cuts in the region. “This is likely to be because investors are selling out their positions in European bonds to buy U.S. Treasuries given that they are offering higher yields,” she said. “However, U.S. Treasury yields are falling back again, and the situation remains very fluid.” TOPICS: Business/Economy KEYWORDS: dollar Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.

Across the Atlantic, longer-dated European government borrowing costs also rose. By 12:22 p.m. in London shortly after China’s announcement, the yield on French 10-year government bonds was 2 basis points higher, the Italian 10-year yield was up 6 basis points and the yield on British 10-year government bonds, known as gilts, was up 9 basis points. The 30-year gilt yield jumped nearly 23 basis points to a fresh 27-year high. Gilt yields are not only suffering spillover effects from the moves in Treasurys, but the gilt market is generally sensitive — relative to other high-grade bond markets — to catalysts that trigger yield rises given stretched margin calls from hedge funds, Diana Iovanel, senior markets economist at Capital Economics, told CNBC. “It’s not too surprising to see more volatility in gilts than in other [developed market] government bonds against the risk-negative and highly uncertain global backdrop. Beyond that, the U.K.‘s stretched fiscal picture is arguably testing investors’ tolerance already,” she added. Germany bucked the trend as its 10-year bund , seen as a benchmark for the euro zone, traded 2 basis points lower. Shorter-dated bonds in Europe meanwhile rose in value. The yields on 2-year government bonds in France, Italy and Britain were 9, 6, and 4 basis points lower, respectively. The yield on Germany’s 2-year bunds dropped 12 basis points. “One factor people are speculating about on Treasurys is around the ongoing theme of a move away from the U.S. dollar, of it becoming less trusted,” Ken Egan, senior director for sovereigns at credit rating analysis agency KBRA, told CNBC in a call on Wednesday. “If you follow that through, one way that could manifest is structural holders of debt, reserve managers in China, could move away from Treasurys in response to policy moves from the U.S.” Egan added that secondary investors also appeared to be taking a step back from U.S. Treasurys, typically seen as a traditional safe haven assets, given the volatile geopolitical climate. “Various forces are at odds, because you have inflationary concerns and a rapid repricing of Treasurys on those, but on the other side you have weak demand and growth, and more rate cuts being priced in,” he told CNBC. German bonds were out of sync with the long-dated market on Wednesday because it is being seen as an alternative safe haven play, as investors — still stunned by the scale of Trump’s actions — wait for more clarity, he said. Egan also noted that European bonds with shorter maturity terms were rising in value as they are more policy-sensitive and traders want to lock in returns now, as more global interest rate cuts are being priced in. “Traditionally you might have gone into the U.S. during a period of volatility, but this is a U.S. story. Germany is benefiting from a wider flight to quality. The country has already told the market what it’s going to do, there’s clarity about what its path will look like,” Egan added, referencing Berlin’s recent passing of a huge fiscal package across infrastructure, climate and defense.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson The 30-year gilt yield jumped nearly 23 basis points to a fresh 27-year high. Gilt yields are not only suffering spillover effects from the moves in Treasurys, but the gilt market is generally sensitive — relative to other high-grade bond markets — to catalysts that trigger yield rises given stretched margin calls from hedge funds, Diana Iovanel, senior markets economist at Capital Economics, told CNBC. “It’s not too surprising to see more volatility in gilts than in other [developed market] government bonds against the risk-negative and highly uncertain global backdrop. Beyond that, the U.K.‘s stretched fiscal picture is arguably testing investors’ tolerance already,” she added. Germany bucked the trend as its 10-year bund , seen as a benchmark for the euro zone, traded 2 basis points lower. Shorter-dated bonds in Europe meanwhile rose in value. The yields on 2-year government bonds in France, Italy and Britain were 9, 6, and 4 basis points lower, respectively. The yield on Germany’s 2-year bunds dropped 12 basis points. “One factor people are speculating about on Treasurys is around the ongoing theme of a move away from the U.S. dollar, of it becoming less trusted,” Ken Egan, senior director for sovereigns at credit rating analysis agency KBRA, told CNBC in a call on Wednesday. “If you follow that through, one way that could manifest is structural holders of debt, reserve managers in China, could move away from Treasurys in response to policy moves from the U.S.” Egan added that secondary investors also appeared to be taking a step back from U.S. Treasurys, typically seen as a traditional safe haven assets, given the volatile geopolitical climate. “Various forces are at odds, because you have inflationary concerns and a rapid repricing of Treasurys on those, but on the other side you have weak demand and growth, and more rate cuts being priced in,” he told CNBC. German bonds were out of sync with the long-dated market on Wednesday because it is being seen as an alternative safe haven play, as investors — still stunned by the scale of Trump’s actions — wait for more clarity, he said. Egan also noted that European bonds with shorter maturity terms were rising in value as they are more policy-sensitive and traders want to lock in returns now, as more global interest rate cuts are being priced in. “Traditionally you might have gone into the U.S. during a period of volatility, but this is a U.S. story. Germany is benefiting from a wider flight to quality. The country has already told the market what it’s going to do, there’s clarity about what its path will look like,” Egan added, referencing Berlin’s recent passing of a huge fiscal package across infrastructure, climate and defense. In a note on Wednesday, Freya Beamish, chief economist at TS Lombard, likened the spike in U.S. government borrowing costs to the U.K.’s 2022 “mini budget” crisis, which rocked the country’s pension funds and led to emergency market intervention by the Bank of England. “The really worrisome thing about negative supply shocks is that they push up inflation and destroy demand at the same time, destroying the hedging capacity of bonds for equities. They are capital destroyers,” she said. “The issue here is not who is right or wrong about the long-term effects of tariffs. It is about investor perceptions over the probability of these types of shocks. And once this narrative starts to be priced in, the risk is of financial accelerators kicking in, as happened in the UK with the LDI crisis.” Alex Brazier, global head of investment and portfolio solutions at BlackRock, told CNBC’s “Squawk Box Europe” on Wednesday that recent months had been a reminder for investors that “we’re in a new world.” “This is not a situation where a classic broad stock index, broad bond index, set-and-forget portfolio is ideal,” he said. “Looking at the fundamentals of the U.S. bond market here, we’ve got some technicals going on, we’ve got early signs of stress in the swap market, that bears closely watching.” Meanwhile, Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, told CNBC via email on Wednesday that some European government bond yields had moved upward despite rising expectations of interest rate cuts in the region. “This is likely to be because investors are selling out their positions in European bonds to buy U.S. Treasuries given that they are offering higher yields,” she said. “However, U.S. Treasury yields are falling back again, and the situation remains very fluid.” TOPICS: Business/Economy KEYWORDS: dollar Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.

German bonds were out of sync with the long-dated market on Wednesday because it is being seen as an alternative safe haven play, as investors — still stunned by the scale of Trump’s actions — wait for more clarity, he said. Egan also noted that European bonds with shorter maturity terms were rising in value as they are more policy-sensitive and traders want to lock in returns now, as more global interest rate cuts are being priced in. “Traditionally you might have gone into the U.S. during a period of volatility, but this is a U.S. story. Germany is benefiting from a wider flight to quality. The country has already told the market what it’s going to do, there’s clarity about what its path will look like,” Egan added, referencing Berlin’s recent passing of a huge fiscal package across infrastructure, climate and defense. In a note on Wednesday, Freya Beamish, chief economist at TS Lombard, likened the spike in U.S. government borrowing costs to the U.K.’s 2022 “mini budget” crisis, which rocked the country’s pension funds and led to emergency market intervention by the Bank of England. “The really worrisome thing about negative supply shocks is that they push up inflation and destroy demand at the same time, destroying the hedging capacity of bonds for equities. They are capital destroyers,” she said. “The issue here is not who is right or wrong about the long-term effects of tariffs. It is about investor perceptions over the probability of these types of shocks. And once this narrative starts to be priced in, the risk is of financial accelerators kicking in, as happened in the UK with the LDI crisis.” Alex Brazier, global head of investment and portfolio solutions at BlackRock, told CNBC’s “Squawk Box Europe” on Wednesday that recent months had been a reminder for investors that “we’re in a new world.” “This is not a situation where a classic broad stock index, broad bond index, set-and-forget portfolio is ideal,” he said. “Looking at the fundamentals of the U.S. bond market here, we’ve got some technicals going on, we’ve got early signs of stress in the swap market, that bears closely watching.” Meanwhile, Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, told CNBC via email on Wednesday that some European government bond yields had moved upward despite rising expectations of interest rate cuts in the region. “This is likely to be because investors are selling out their positions in European bonds to buy U.S. Treasuries given that they are offering higher yields,” she said. “However, U.S. Treasury yields are falling back again, and the situation remains very fluid.” TOPICS: Business/Economy KEYWORDS: dollar Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.

German bonds were out of sync with the long-dated market on Wednesday because it is being seen as an alternative safe haven play, as investors — still stunned by the scale of Trump’s actions — wait for more clarity, he said. Egan also noted that European bonds with shorter maturity terms were rising in value as they are more policy-sensitive and traders want to lock in returns now, as more global interest rate cuts are being priced in. “Traditionally you might have gone into the U.S. during a period of volatility, but this is a U.S. story. Germany is benefiting from a wider flight to quality. The country has already told the market what it’s going to do, there’s clarity about what its path will look like,” Egan added, referencing Berlin’s recent passing of a huge fiscal package across infrastructure, climate and defense. In a note on Wednesday, Freya Beamish, chief economist at TS Lombard, likened the spike in U.S. government borrowing costs to the U.K.’s 2022 “mini budget” crisis, which rocked the country’s pension funds and led to emergency market intervention by the Bank of England. “The really worrisome thing about negative supply shocks is that they push up inflation and destroy demand at the same time, destroying the hedging capacity of bonds for equities. They are capital destroyers,” she said. “The issue here is not who is right or wrong about the long-term effects of tariffs. It is about investor perceptions over the probability of these types of shocks. And once this narrative starts to be priced in, the risk is of financial accelerators kicking in, as happened in the UK with the LDI crisis.” Alex Brazier, global head of investment and portfolio solutions at BlackRock, told CNBC’s “Squawk Box Europe” on Wednesday that recent months had been a reminder for investors that “we’re in a new world.” “This is not a situation where a classic broad stock index, broad bond index, set-and-forget portfolio is ideal,” he said. “Looking at the fundamentals of the U.S. bond market here, we’ve got some technicals going on, we’ve got early signs of stress in the swap market, that bears closely watching.” Meanwhile, Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, told CNBC via email on Wednesday that some European government bond yields had moved upward despite rising expectations of interest rate cuts in the region. “This is likely to be because investors are selling out their positions in European bonds to buy U.S. Treasuries given that they are offering higher yields,” she said. “However, U.S. Treasury yields are falling back again, and the situation remains very fluid.” TOPICS: Business/Economy KEYWORDS: dollar Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.

Germany is benefiting from a wider flight to quality. The country has already told the market what it’s going to do, there’s clarity about what its path will look like,” Egan added, referencing Berlin’s recent passing of a huge fiscal package across infrastructure, climate and defense. In a note on Wednesday, Freya Beamish, chief economist at TS Lombard, likened the spike in U.S. government borrowing costs to the U.K.’s 2022 “mini budget” crisis, which rocked the country’s pension funds and led to emergency market intervention by the Bank of England. “The really worrisome thing about negative supply shocks is that they push up inflation and destroy demand at the same time, destroying the hedging capacity of bonds for equities. They are capital destroyers,” she said. “The issue here is not who is right or wrong about the long-term effects of tariffs. It is about investor perceptions over the probability of these types of shocks. And once this narrative starts to be priced in, the risk is of financial accelerators kicking in, as happened in the UK with the LDI crisis.” Alex Brazier, global head of investment and portfolio solutions at BlackRock, told CNBC’s “Squawk Box Europe” on Wednesday that recent months had been a reminder for investors that “we’re in a new world.” “This is not a situation where a classic broad stock index, broad bond index, set-and-forget portfolio is ideal,” he said. “Looking at the fundamentals of the U.S. bond market here, we’ve got some technicals going on, we’ve got early signs of stress in the swap market, that bears closely watching.” Meanwhile, Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, told CNBC via email on Wednesday that some European government bond yields had moved upward despite rising expectations of interest rate cuts in the region. “This is likely to be because investors are selling out their positions in European bonds to buy U.S. Treasuries given that they are offering higher yields,” she said. “However, U.S. Treasury yields are falling back again, and the situation remains very fluid.” TOPICS: Business/Economy KEYWORDS: dollar Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.

Safe Haven = Gold Always has been always will be The generations after the Boomers do not care one whit for the market and investing, even for Gen X all of that has been placed out of reach and they see no benefit to the market personally for wealth generation. This is supported by the fact that 80%+ of all stocks and bonds are held by 10% of the population. The truly “rich” have created this by destroying the middle class. Now there is little middle class left to care about things like investments and most are even happy to see the “rich” get soaked this way, as it literally has little impact on them being the “poor” working class. With the GSR now at 100, Safer Haven = Silver. Do keep in mind that the gold market is the same as the diamond. Controlled by a few players and there is no limit to how much can be made available on notice. I tell you that Germany is the last place I would put my money. Treasuries are going down because many people use those for their possible margin calls. And that is happening so they are selling their treasuries to cover their margins. This includes big companies and little people both. China and democrats are no doubt selling them to harm Trump too. If someone is selling, someone else is buying. No? I am a boomer (born in last year or 2 of the Gen). But Boomers perhaps squandered more national wealth than any country in history..not forced. Our Gen rush to buy cheap communist goods and sell out our jobs in the process is something I still don’t understand. Although to be honest I suppose many of the politicians and powerful in the 90s were of the Greatest Gen . Grok said only 3 of the top richest men in the USA in 1993 were Baby Boomers.

Title: China Puts Spoke In The Wheel After US Calls Beijing A Threat To Panama

China has slammed the United States' "bullying nature", after US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Beijing was threatening the Panama Canal's operations. Beijing said US officials had "maliciously attacked" it over the key waterway to further its own interests. China is also reportedly influencing the Trump administration-backed sale of two key Panama Canal ports, operated by Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison, to US investment firm BlackRock."Senior US officials have maliciously attacked China, smearing and undermining China-Panama cooperation, once again exposing the United States' bullying nature," foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said at a regular press briefing. This came after the Chinese embassy in Panama, in a statement on X, said the US has used "blackmail" to back its own interests and the "US doesn't have the right to interfere in" who Panama chooses to carry out business with. "The US has carried out a sensationalistic campaign about the 'theoretical Chinese threat' in an attempt to sabotage Chinese-Panamanian cooperation, which is all just rooted in the United States' own geopolitical interests," the embassy wrote. Pete Hegseth's Panama Visit US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, the second senior US official to visit Panama since President Donald Trump took office in January, on Tuesday vowed to "take back" the "US-built" canal to counter what he sees as China's influence over the waterway. Hegseth's visit to Panama comes two months after that of US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. "Today, the Panama Canal faces ongoing threats...The United States of America will not allow communist China or any other country to threaten the canal's operation or integrity," Hegseth said in a speech Tuesday at a police station located at the entry to the shipping route. He also met with Panama's President Jose Raul Mulino, with the two issuing a joint statement that affirmed security ties. However, there was a notable discrepancy in the versions released by both sides on the issue of Panama's sovereignty over the canal. "Secretary Hegseth recognized Panama's leadership and inalienable sovereignty over the Panama Canal and its adjacent areas," read a Spanish-language statement released by Mulino's office. That sentence did not appear in the English-language statement released by the US government. However, shortly after that visit, Panama announced it was pulling out of Chinese President Xi Jinping's landmark global infrastructure program, the Belt and Road Initiative. Panama Canal Issue Hong Kong company CK Hutchison operates two ports at either end of the canal connecting the Atlantic and Pacific, through which five percent of all global shipping passes. The Trump administration has put immense pressure on Panama to reduce what it calls Chinese influence on the canal, which Washington sees as a threat to US national security. Panama has, however, denied the assertions that China exercises undue control over the waterway. But faced with Trump's repeated threats to seize the canal, Panama has put pressure on CK Hutchison to pull out of the country. In January, it began an audit of Panama Ports -- the subsidiary -- to determine if it was honoring its concession contract. After months of President Trump repeatedly saying that China asserted too much control over the Panama Canal, CK Hutchison, in March, announced an agreement to sell 43 ports in 23 countries -- including its two on the canal -- to a group led by giant US asset manager BlackRock for $19 billion in cash. The deal was touted as a victory by President Donald Trump and was scheduled to be signed on April 2. But a furious Beijing has since announced an antitrust review of the deal, which likely prevented the parties from signing an agreement last week as had been planned, according to a report by AFP. It was further delayed after on the eve of Hegseth's visit, Panama's comptroller announced that the audit had revealed "many breaches" of the contract and said Panama did not receive $1.2 billion it was owed from the operator.

Wednesday, 09 Apr 2025 KUALA LUMPUR: 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) and its 10 subsidiaries on Wednesday (April 9) withdrew their lawsuit against Singaporean national Shabnam Naraindas Daswani over the alleged purchase of luxury items worth more than USD346mil, allegedly acquired using misappropriated 1MDB funds. Shabnam (also known as Natasha Mirpuri) was initially named as a co-defendant in the suit alongside Datin Seri Rosmah Mansor, the wife of former Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak. However, Rosmah remains a defendant in the ongoing lawsuit. According to lawyer Nathalie Ker Si Min, representing 1MDB, a consent judgment was recorded before High Court Judge Wan Muhammad Amin Wan Yahya during online proceedings on Wednesday. "The consent judgment records the plaintiff's decision not to continue with the suit against Shabnam, with liberty to file afresh," Ker confirmed when contacted by reporters. Meanwhile, when contacted, Shabnam's lawyer, Datuk N. Sivananthan, also confirmed the development. The lawsuit was initially filed on May 9, 2024, naming Rosmah and Shabnam as the first and second defendants. The ten subsidiaries involved as co-plaintiffs are: 1MDB Energy Holdings Limited, 1MDB Energy Limited, 1MDB Energy (Langat) Limited, Global Diversified Investment Company Limited, SRC International Sdn Bhd, Affinity Equity International Partners Limited, Alsen Chance Holdings Limited, Blackrock Commodities (Global) Limited, Blackstone Asia Real Estate Partners Limited and Brightstone Jewellery Limited. The plaintiffs are seeking a court order compelling Rosmah to pay USD346,010,489 or a sum to be assessed by the court. They also seek court declarations, including one asserting that the first to sixth plaintiffs hold rightful ownership of the luxury items, currently purported to be in Rosmah's possession. – Bernama Thank you for your report!

Title: Eugene, OR, is finally building bike-optimized singletrack in Suzanne Arlie Park

The city of Eugene sits in the lush evergreens of Oregon’s Willamette Valley, on the western side of the Cascade Mountain Range. Along with the town of Springfield, separated from Eugene by the Willamette River, the area boasts a population of nearly 250,000 residents, making it Oregon’s third-largest city. Despite the city’s size (okay, it’s large for us Oregonians), trail access is few and far between for Eugene’s mountain bikers. Many riders in the area find themselves making the journey to places like Alsea Falls, Blackrock, or Oakridge — proper mountain bike destinations themselves, but a bit of a trek from Eugene. However, the city of Eugene is looking to change that. A new trail proposal has been approved, and the city is now looking for trail builders to construct 12 miles of new trails, much of it mountain bike-specific singletrack. As you can imagine, this has Eugene-area mountain bikers stoked! Mountain bikers in the Eugene/Springfield area have been relatively hamstrung if they want to ride singletrack close to the city. Aside from a random bit of trail here and there, along with what appears to be mellower bike paths, residents have two options: Ridgeline Park in Eugene and Thurston Hills in Springfield. Carpenter Bypass is another popular location, but it’s located nearly 30 minutes south of Eugene via the interstate. Local riders and advocacy groups have expressed growing frustration over the absence of nearby trail systems. These groups have repeatedly urged the city to build more trails, but as is common around the country, finances and resources are spread thin. What Eugene does have going for it is an abundance of parks and open space. “I was involved in purchasing this property back in 2008,” Philip Richardson told us. “We bought it in several chunks. Now we have 565 acres.” Richardson is a City of Eugene Landscape Architect and Parks Planner in the Parks and Open Space Division. The 565 acres of land he referred to is Eugene’s Suzanne Arlie Park, where the 12 miles of new trail will be located. Suzanne Arlie is Eugene’s largest park. It skirts Eugene’s eastern city limits, falling between the popular Mt. Baldy and Interstate 5. The land was first purchased in 2008, with the city acquiring 200 acres. Three years later, Eugene purchased the remainder of the land comprising the park’s current acreage. Today, the park has a series of hiking trails, including Eugene’s Ridgeline Trail, which stretches through several parks. Aside from some social trails that mountain bikers built in years past, Suzanne Arlie Park hasn’t seen any singletrack development. Thanks to the nudge from local riders and Eugene’s willingness to provide a space for trail development, Richardson anticipates construction on the new mountain bike trails to begin within the next few months. Eugene hired Eddie Kessler of Ptarmigan Trails to consult and help build an overall trail plan. They’ve decided to break the project up into two parts: the trails and the amenities. The amenities include the trailhead itself, bathrooms, parking, and widening the road near the trailhead, which zoning codes require. This shouldn’t be an issue for Eugene, as most of this is standard construction and does not require specialized trail crews. Part two of the project consists of the trails themselves, which Richardson said have been more of a challenge. The city asked for bids on the project, yet few came in. The project spans two building seasons, which is part of the issue with finding a trail-building contractor. “We talked to some of the bigger folks like Dirt Mechanics, and they’re just booked through 2026,” Richardson explained. This isn’t surprising given recent trail expansion and the increased use of specialized trail-building contractors in recent years. Fortunately, as of the time we spoke, Richardson did share that they have received a bid on the project, although the city wasn’t ready to share the details. Eugene received a $1.2 million federal economic development grant for the project. Richardson remains hopeful they will still get the funding, even though the Trump Administration has created uncertainty around how recreation funds are distributed. He doesn’t anticipate that this federal funding will cover the entirety of the project and told us that the city is seeking additional funds. Richardson predicted the Suzanne Arlie project could cost upwards of $2.5–$3 million. Roughly two of the twelve miles of new trail in Suzanne Arlie Park will be an extension of the Ridgeline Trail. Like so many around the country, this existing trail grew in popularity during COVID. However, the trail is more popular with trail runners and hikers, with many miles closed to bike use. Even the sections open to mountain bikes weren’t necessarily where people would want to ride. “Another interesting thing that [Kessler] helped us as an agency kind of get our mind around [was that] pretty much all of Ridgeline has been designed for hikers,” Richardson explained. “[Eugene trails are] not really designed with bikes in mind.” To address this lack of MTB trails, 5.6 miles of the new trails at Suzanne Arlie will be designed and built specifically for mountain bikers. They will consist of five beginner, four intermediate, and four advanced trails. The remaining 4.4 miles of trail will be multi-use, some connecting with the bike-optimized trails to create loops. While there isn’t much information yet about exactly how each of these individual trails will be built, unofficial planning names give some hints. Trail identifiers such as “Enduro 1,” “Blue DH,” “Black DH,” “Family Flow 1,” and others all sound like descending-focused trails. The remaining four-plus miles of new trails in Suzanne Arlie Park will be what the city of Eugene calls “shared use.” And while these trails won’t be designed with mountain biking in mind, Richardson explained that they lean more toward the mountain biking end of the spectrum. “I think just because of how much use and activity there is from mountain bikers, it’s like ‘mountain bike’ and ‘trail design’ [are] kind of in the forefront right now of the best trail design, whether you’re talking about hikers or bikers,” he said. Praise from a city parks planner goes a long way in building a relationship between the city and the local mountain bike community. Richardson hopes to partner with trail organizations like Disciples of Dirt for trail maintenance at Suzanne Arlie. As the project gets closer to kicking off, Richardson knows crews will deal with a relatively short build season. While snow and freeze/thaw aren’t the issue in Eugene, water certainly is. The city can receive up to 50 inches of rainfall annually. When the weather does turn dry, the building window only holds for several weeks before the fire risk creeps to extreme. Richardson and the city of Eugene would love to have the project wrapped up by the end of the 2026 building season. This will depend on the city securing more funds for the Suzanne Arlie Park Project and cooperative building seasons. Updated at 1:30pm MDT on April 10, 2025, to reflect that 5.6 miles of trail will be mountain bike-only, not shared-use as originally reported by Richardson.

Title: Private Credit Is Challenging Banks and Changing the Terrain of CRE Finance

Time Published: 2025-04-09T10:00:25Z

© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy During a climactic moment of the classic 1975 film “Jaws,” the three fishermen finally encounter up close the killer shark they’re hunting, leading actor Roy Scheider’s chief Martin Brody to utter the famous line, “You’re gonna need a bigger boat.” In many ways, here in 2025, the commercial real estate capital markets system is going to need a bigger boat to get a handle on private credit. It’s a less-well understood part of the financing world that has gone from being a minor, back alley lending option 20 years ago into a $1.7 trillion industry that is expected to double its asset volume by the end of the decade. “It has changed a lot, and part of it is just the fact that the market has adapted to think about private credit not as a last resort, but, in many ways, as a first option,” said Josh Zegen, managing principal and co-founder of Madison Realty Capital, a debt fund with $22 billion in assets. Between 2013 and 2023, U.S. private credit — corporate and real estate loans originated by private, nonbank lenders — grew from $141 billion to $853 billion, according to the financial data provider Preqin. That’s not that surprising. The market’s largest players — Apollo Global Management, Ares Management and Blackstone — to say nothing of “smaller” firms, with their $2 billion to $25 billion in assets, have raised money from institutional investors seeking higher returns. This fundraising has come at a time when banks have pulled back their CRE and corporate lending, making the need for private credit financing not just enticing but also necessary. BlackRock now predicts that the global private credit market will double and reach $3.5 trillion by 2030, according to The Wall Street Journal. Much of that has flown into commercial real estate assets underwater at maturity and in need of rescue capital, or ambitious construction projects looking for bridge and senior financing to either get off the ground or across the finish line. “It’s been an incredible positive for the industry, and the amount of liquidity that’s come in, on the credit side, is staggering, and it’s clearly coming from the debt funds,” said Tom Traynor, vice chairman and co-head of large loans at CBRE (CBRE). Traynor noted that as recently as 15 years ago, private credit was limited to a smattering of opportunity funds financing mezzanine pieces. Today the trillion-dollar industry creates highly complex loans, structured with the tightest possible spreads, that fund the full spectrum of core and core-plus assets to value-add and opportunistic real estate credit. “The banks are, by far, the biggest group within the lending universe, but it’s pretty incredible the impact private credit has had on an institutional level, because it’s created really robust competition,” he said. “They’re basically in competition with everybody.” Even long-term players in the private credit space like Zegen are surprised by its rapid evolution, especially when he recalled how investors couldn’t initially differentiate the need to separate real estate equity from traditional credit, or decipher how a novel lending product could deliver better returns than classic fixed-income investments like Treasurys and corporate bonds. “When we started business 21 years ago, from 2004 to 2008, it was everything a bank didn’t want to do — you were dealing with special situations, someone who needed money quickly for a last-minute deal,” said Zegen. “The borrower universe took time to understand, and the same was true for the institutional investor base. It needed to adapt, get educated and put money out.” Seth Weissman, managing partner of Urban Standard Capital, an alternative lender that has financed $1.4 billion worth of CRE projects, listed several factors that have come together to grow the private credit space. First, the 2023 regional banking crisis, which saw four of the five largest commercial bank failures in U.S. history, spooked lenders and depositors alike. Banks pulled back their lending after that. Borrowers then turn to private credit for speed, flexibility and bespoke deal structuring, choosing to go with long-term loans financed by pension funds, asset managers and insurance companies, rather than panicky deposits from Main Street businesses and individual families. “It’s a more institutional and sophisticated investment base, and every private lender is overpaid for their risk,” said Weissman. “They call it the golden age of private credit for a reason.” And it’s not as if banks are weeping at the thought of allowing an unregulated “shadow bank” market to grow unabated. Often, private credit funds bear the risk of various CRE and corporate loans that normally require onerous capital reserve requirements and perhaps several board meetings for a bank to even approve. Large commercial banks like Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Chase regularly provide back leverage to private credit firms that originate risky CRE debt, mainly through warehouse lines, repurchase agreements and loan-on-loan financings. “It’s competition but it’s also collaborating,” said David Bouton, co-head of U.S. commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) at Citigroup. “We jointly do deals with clients who are private credit, we source loans and provide back leverage, and in certain ways, it’s actually provided a very good partnership.” Last year, Bouton and Joseph Dyckman, the other head of U.S. CMBS at Citigroup, extended $4 billion of warehouse line repurchase agreements to nonbank lenders, bringing the bank’s total commitment in that space to $13 billion. “I think our clients view it as another way to partner with Citi, and we view it as a way to expand the origination platform,” said Dyckman, who added he’s not too worried about the exponential growth of shadow banking. “Everyone makes a big deal about private credit markets, but private credit can’t withstand the volume we’ll see in the next several years, so there’s still a tremendous opportunity for bank balance sheet lending to continue.” Scott Rechler, chairman of RXR, has been able to view the emergence of private credit through the lens of being both a borrower and a private lender, as his firm launched a $1 billion CRE credit strategy in 2023. Rechler argued that banks like to be lenders to nonbanks due to the favorable credit treatment and the better collateral, as well as the fact that whole loans provided to the funds are often broken up to disentangle risk — which is also easier for borrowers to live with. “What we’re finding, we’re seeing, is an interesting simpatico, where everyone is finding their home and it works for all pieces,” said Rechler. “And, so, that is a good development that will create somewhat more permanent capital for the borrower and re-equitize the CRE space.” Humble origins Unlike its more famous (and maligned) cousin, private equity, which emerged out of the go-go 1980s and was immortalized by movies like Wall Street and books like Barbarians at the Gate, the industry of private credit has its origins in the lending apocalypse that followed the Global Financial Crisis of 2007-2009. “After the GFC, the Dodd-Frank [financial oversight legislation] went into effect and regulatory oversight pushed business to the shadow banking market. That’s how debt funds got started,” explained James Millon, president of U.S. debt and structured finance at CBRE. In the post-GFC banking landscape, onerous regulations made it more challenging and expensive for traditional lenders to play a role in financing real estate and corporate debt. And, while the federal Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and the Term Asset‐Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) were designed to open up liquidity within the asset-backed securitization space, the programs also created an incentive for private debt funds, nonbank lenders and mortgage REITs to open their doors to originate loans and borrow against them at cheap rates. Both Millon and Rechler independently likened the capital markets’ innovation in this period to what occurred when private firms established the modern commercial mortgage-backed securities market in the early 1990s to replace the failed savings and loan industry that began a painful, multiyear collapse in 1987. “After the savings and loan crisis, the nonbank lender that evolved was the CMBS market, which didn’t exist before that,” explained Rechler. “After the GFC, the regulatory environment made it much more challenging and expensive for traditional lenders to play a role, which led to nonbank lenders.” And, at first blush, the nonbank lending industry was relatively small. In 2009, it was only $250 billion, while total private credit assets under management didn’t even reach $1 trillion until 2020, according to data from the Wall Street Journal. “Before it was formalized, and had the glow of being called private credit, the private lending world was hard money lending, it was sharp elbowed and could be called predatory,” said Weissman. But it did fill a void. Michael Gigliotti, senior managing director at JLL Capital Markets, explained that GE Real Estate and Mesa West Capital were among the first that saw the gap in the marketplace of CRE bridge loans that banks were either avoiding due to nonrecourse risk or the dangerous leverage requirements, which flew in the face of new Dodd-Frank mandates. Moreover, investment dollars into various CRE asset classes only grew once the S&P 500 added real estate in 2016 as one of 11 sectors in its Global Industry Classification Standard, pushing real estate finance well beyond the traditional bounds of public REIT stock purchases. “People really gravitated toward [private credit] because it solved issues, and then there wasn’t enough of it, so more people took advantage of it,” said Gigliotti. “Also there was the ability to earn equity-like returns in the credit space because of leverage you could put on their credit.” There were sector specific loans, too, that required the touch of private credit. S3 Capital’s Robert Schwartz, who co-founded his firm in 2013, said that by the mid-2010s regional banks were completely inactive lenders in the sub-$20 million space for construction loans. That allowed his firm to grow quickly by filling that void, mainly in New York City, and eventually nationally. Today S3 Capital has originated $6.3 billion in multifamily bridge and construction loans. “The need for that capital was huge, and the regional banks were ignoring it. There was no real institutional presence in that market back then for those lenders,” said Schwartz. But the Dodd-Frank rules, while well intentioned to rein in the excesses of the commercial and investment banks that nearly blew up the global financial system, also had an unintended side effect. After 2008, the government no longer wanted to see banks use the deposits of Joe Six-Pack or Molly Main Street to finance CRE investment sales, construction projects, lease-ups or repostings. Instead, they wanted that financing to come from institutional investors that could bear the brunt of any losses (and certainly the headlines). “The regulation is well intended but it’s not executed well,” said Weissman. “As it’s become harder to get loans from banks, it’s opened up the desire and demand for alternative financing, and that’s what’s accelerated that business.” Clients for you. Clients for me? For both banks and nonbank lenders alike, the crux of their business model is to secure clients — either depositors or long-term investors, sometimes direct referrals, often repeat borrowers — that allow them to make loans on lucrative assets. Now that a second player has entered the credit space, however, banks are feeling the heat as there’s only a limited number of clients to service and only so much debt needed at once. “The thought process that your local banker is your tried and true, to be trusted for all your banking needs, mortgages, lines of credit, has been turned on its head with the prevalence of private credit,” said real estate finance attorney Christine O’Connell, a partner at King & Spalding. “Back in 2008 to 2010, when banks pulled back and private credit came in, it was seen as dangerous for borrowers. But, as these players have grown in the space, it’s almost become the banks that used to be there.” Those who have succeeded in the alternative lending space believe they can offer their borrowers services that banks either can’t do or won’t do, particularly speed of execution and the ability to take over stalled projects and foreclosures due to their vertically integrated structure. Marcello Cricco-Lizza, principal of global commercial real estate at Balbec Capital, an alternative investment manager with $7 billion in assets, argued that large bank loans often take months to close, due to regulatory constraints, while bank appraisals can take two to three weeks as nervous boards review the details. “There’s a whole slew of borrowers for whom bank financing just doesn’t make sense. There’s not enough proceeds, and they can’t go high enough in leverage,” he said. “Whereas, we can add higher leverage on our loans and have the sophistication to take over those properties and work them out that banks don’t have.” Aside from the ability to offer higher loan-to-value ratios, there’s a certain personal touch that many private credit asset managers tend to advertise as well. Warren de Haan, CEO and managing partner of Acore Capital, a CRE investment firm with $19 billion in AUM, noted that his company currently has 80 borrowers with whom they’ve made at least three deals, and that “there’s not much reason for them to go elsewhere,” due to the familiarity between both parties. “Today, when you have a difficult macro environment with higher interest rates, there’s more of a hands-on asset management function that’s required for borrowers to feel they’ve had a great experience,” he said. “Everything we do feeds the funnel of production, so our goal is to give our clients a white-glove experience.” Investors have taken notice of the more borrower-friendly landscape. The proportion of bank lending compared to all corporate borrowing dropped from 44 percent in 2020 to 35 percent in 2023, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. In an increasingly situational and deal-specific marketplace, where borrowers choose their lenders based on deal theme and expertise, banks have responded by highlighting their resumés and relationships, to say nothing of their global, multinational outreach. “Banks are leaning in on strong relationships that they have to keep their clients, but I don’t think they’re expanding into too many new relationships,” said David Perlman, managing director at Thorofare Capital, a vertically integrated commercial real estate debt manager. “If you have a good relationship, you’ll get a good bank quote, but it’s very competitive.” Perlman added that the largest commercial banks have the luxury of holding a global viewpoint toward their clients’ business needs. This allows them to be more flexible on deal structures, like waving upfront fees and yield maintenance, due to the global revenue their deposits eventually accrue. Attorney Scott Levine, a partner at King & Spalding, told CO that relationships “are a huge reason” why his CRE clients go to certain banks for financing, and that debt funds were known in the post-GFC landscape from 15 years ago to sometimes sell off pieces of their loans. “Borrowers have historically felt the debt funds were more likely to sell than the banks, particularly when things went south, and that’s when they got concerned,” he said. “The banks may have been selling pieces of loans, but they were generally sticking around in the deal — and, for borrowers, they knew who was on the phone when they called.” But the outlook is not entirely sunny for U.S. commercial banking. Most banks’ legacy portfolios have issues, whether from 30-year mortgages written at low interest rates, or 10-year office loans now completely underwater. Plus, almost every bank is feeling the heat from nervous depositors, who are tempted by Treasurys, money market accounts, mutual funds and, yes, debt funds. Moreover, the uncertainty of Basel III — an international framework on bank capital requirements and liquidity and leverage regulations — has also depressed the sector’s standing among borrowers, as banks have been more cautious about extending CRE loans amid the Basel fog, which requires higher capital requirements to compensate for the increased risk. So, ironically, banks have responded to the competition from private credit by becoming the private credit industry’s lender of choice, and changing the nature of commercial real estate finance in the process. Risk vs. reward As Stuart Boesky explains it, the banks just got tired of carrying all the risk in big CRE projects. The industry veteran and CEO of Pembrook Capital told CO that the nation’s largest banks actively decided that it would be most cost effective for the active fund managers to take some of their “smaller” clients away from them. In return, the banks would help these entities by originating large loans at advance rates that reduced risk and allowed themselves to remain participants in the CRE market, albeit with a smaller staff and less overhead. The debt funds, in turn, generated new business and created clients for life. “Until very recently, I think the banks were happy to let the funds do their business,” said Boesky. “I don’t think that business was profitable to banks due to cost of capital and regulatory requirements and so they were very willing to lend to those big funds.” Through warehouse-type facilities and repurchase structures (repos) – which include note-on-note finances, joint venture uni-trench loans and single-asset repos — the banks have been able to originate safer CRE loans that receive better capital treatment and that place balance sheet risk in the hands of safer sponsors. “Their desire to finance us is top of their list,” said de Haan. “It’s a partnership between alternative lenders and the banks that results in more liquidity available at an attractive cost for the CRE industry, and that’s a positive long-term trend.” Balbec Capital’s Cricco-Lizza has called this universe of lender financing “the most competitive sector today within all of CRE,” and said that the competitive nature among debt funds for bank loan business has pushed out many regional banks that otherwise would be making bridge and construction loans. “Everyone wants to be in it,” he said. “Because the people providing lender financing don’t take a loss, if you do the work property, but it’s a low-risk business where you can still earn some spread, and a lot of bigger banks in direct CRE lending have done pretty poorly.” Citigroup’s Dyckman said lender financings allowed his commercial bank to originate certain types of loans they normally wouldn’t consider because they have a professional banking partner with them to carry most of the risk. “Now we can do deals with size,” said Dyckman. “It’s been a tremendous sort of growth for us over the last 12 months.” But, like anything in the nebulous waters of high finance, enormous risks balance out the enormous rewards. Boesky argued that in many respects the evolution of debt funds is a good thing, as banks in the post-GFC years offered historically low LTV levels on CRE loans that would’ve depressed the product across all sectors had debt funds not come into existence. But he cautioned that private credit might be growing too large, too quickly. “As they raise more and more money, they get more competitive, which means they have to price their loan products at points that don’t adequately compensate them for the associated risk,” he said. “And sometimes things like that end badly.” Rechler — who is both a borrower of, and lender in, private credit — admitted that there is a lack of transparency on the capital that has created some risk in this new system. “When banks do it, the regulators know exactly what’s out there, they know what banks are lending and how much to each sector, but that’s not really transparent on these funds,” he said. Casual observers should recognize that if a black swan event occurs, commercial banks’ exposure is limited because they are lending at a senior position to the funds. They’ll be more protected than the actual investors into private credit, who would take the first losses. “If there’s margin calls, or a COVID-style event, all of sudden the leverage providers to private credit will call in their loans, and a lot of lenders don’t have that margin call type of facility,” said Weissman. “It’s not that there’s no risk. There’s a transfer of risk and repricing of risk that’s happening here.” Others in the space are bullish no matter what the market brings. Zegen conceded that while there’s room for multiple players, the investor base of private credit is expanding from institutions to now encompass wealth managers, IRA accounts, and individual retail investors “They’re funding the next age of private credit, and more and more it’s taking the place of banks,” said Zegen. “We’re in the early innings of it.” Brian Pascus can be reached at bpascus@commercialobserver.com Read the latest edition of the Commercial Observer online!

The religious roots of climate-conscious investing. In 2020, an investment strategy was all the rage on Wall Street: ESG, or environmental, social and governance investing. It’s a wonky term with a simple premise: Companies that manage the risks and opportunities posed by societal issues like climate change will perform better, especially in the long term. For a moment, it seemed Wall Street could be part of the solution to the climate crisis, driving companies to decarbonize — if not to save the planet, to protect their own bottom lines. That was, until a fierce and widespread backlash against ESG took hold. To understand the backlash to ESG, and, more specifically, climate-conscious investing, it helps to first understand its humble origins. Part of that history began about as far from Wall Street as possible, spiritually anyway, with faith-based investors. “Going back 100 years, some religious organizations felt that their faith and values had to be reflected in their investments too,” said Tim Smith, policy adviser and a founder of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility. For example, “United Methodists wouldn't have invested in tobacco and alcohol,” he said. But in 1971, the religious community entered a new chapter, sparked by the atrocities of apartheid in South Africa. Smith said the Episcopal Church had been outspoken on the issue, but realized its money told a different story. The church was invested in companies and banks doing business as usual in South Africa. So leaders decided to file a shareholder resolution, to ask General Motors to pull out of South Africa. “The presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church went to the General Motors stockholders meeting and spoke, dressed in his Episcopal finery, and challenged General Motors on the moral justification for staying there,” Smith said. It took 15 years of fighting and growing public pressure, but in 1986, General Motors relented, citing moral and financial reasons. It was a pivotal moment in church and business history, Smith said, “because that kind of appeal to a company through the shareholder resolution process, especially by a church group, had not been happening.” In the decades that followed, faith-based investors started pressing companies in their portfolios on other social issues like labor, discrimination, and pollution. Pat Daly, a member of the Sisters of St. Dominic of Caldwell in New Jersey, led the charge on pushing companies to act on climate change. Daly died in 2022, but by all accounts, she was a force. For decades, she pushed huge corporations like GE, Ford and Exxon Mobil to take steps to address their environmental impact. In a 2016 interview, Daly credited the decades of work from faith-based investors for laying the groundwork for ESG investing. “I think the legacy is that we really have started the ESG movement,” she said. “We've set it in play, and it's taking off.” By the early 2000s, Wall Street was paying attention to these issues too, but for a very different reason: The bottom line. In 2020, when BlackRock CEO Larry Fink announced that climate change would be a focus for the firm’s portfolios, it seemed like the interests of Wall Street were converging with the goals of faith-based investors. In this episode of “How We Survive,” we travel to the hub for religious investors: the God Box in New York City. We trace the parallel tracks of religious investors and Wall Street stakeholders back in time to find out how ESG became the polarizing strategy it is today.

Title: The Pfizer Papers: Pfizer’s Crimes Against Humanity. Dr. Naomi Wolf

Full Content:
[Lest we forget the crimes perpetrated by Pfizer, we repost this article by Dr. Naomi Wolf, first published by GR in October 2024.] Our book, The Pfizer Papers: Pfizer’s Crimes Against Humanity, was published October 15 and became an immediate bestseller. This is a book that three governments—the US, the UK and Australia—all sought to suppress. The story of how it came to be is extraordinary—3,250 highly credentialed doctors and scientists under the leadership of one extraordinary woman, Amy Kelly, worked for two years on the 450,000 internal Pfizer documents released under court order by a successful lawsuit by attorney Aaron Siri. In the process these volunteers confirmed the greatest crime against humanity of all time. Read on. This book in your hands is the result of an extraordinary set of confluences. It also presents, in a format available in bookstores for the first time, material that has already changed history. You are about to embark as a reader on a journey through an extraordinary story—one whose elements almost defy belief. The Pfizer Papers is the result of a group of strangers—ordinary people with extraordinary skills, located in different places around the world, with different backgrounds and interests—who all came together, for no money or professional recompense at all; out of the goodness of their hearts, and motivated by love for true medicine and true science—to undertake a rigorous, painfully detailed, and complex research project, which spanned the years 2022 to the present, and which continues to this day. The material they read through and analyzed involved 450,000 pages of documents, all written in extremely dense, technical language. This far-flung, relentlessly pursued research project—under the leadership of DailyClout’s COO, the remarkably gifted project director Amy Kelly—brought one of the largest and most corrupt institutions in the world, Pfizer, to its knees. This project, pursued by 3,250 strangers who worked virtually and became friends and colleagues, drove a global pharmaceutical behemoth to lose billions of dollars in revenue. It balked the plans of the most powerful politicians on earth. It bypassed the censorship of the most powerful tech companies on earth. This is the ultimate David and Goliath story. The story began when lawyer Aaron Siri successfully sued the Food and Drug Administration, to compel them to release “The Pfizer Documents.” These are Pfizer’s internal documents—as noted above, 450,000 pages in number—that detail the clinical trials Pfizer conducted in relation to its COVID mRNA injection. These trials were undertaken to secure the ultimate prize for a pharmaceutical company, the “EUA,” or Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA. The FDA awarded EUA for ages 16+ to Pfizer in December 2020. The “pandemic,” of course (a crisis in public health that a book of mine, The Bodies of Others, confirmed, involved hyped and manipulated “infections” data and skewed mortality documentation) became the pretext for the “urgency” that led the FDA to bestow EUA on Pfizer’s (and Moderna’s) novel drug. The EUA is the hall pass, essentially, allowing Pfizer to race right to market with a not-fully-tested product. The Pfizer Papers also contains documentation of what happened in “post-marketing,” meaning in the three months, December 2020 to February 2021, as the vaccine was rolled out upon the public. All leading spokespeople, and bought-off media, called the injection “safe and effective,” reading from what was a centralized script. Many people who took this injection, as it was launched in 2020–2021–2022 and to the present, did not realize that normal testing for safety of a new vaccine—testing that typically takes ten to twelve years—had simply been bypassed via the mechanisms of a “state of emergency” and the FDA’s “Emergency Use Authorization.” They did not understand that the real “testing” was in fact Pfizer and the FDA observing whatever was happening to them and their loved ones, after these citizens rolled up their sleeves and submitted to the shot. As we can never forget, many millions of these people who submitted to the injection were “mandated” to take it, facing the threat of job loss, suspension of their education, or loss of their military positions if they refused; in some US states and overseas countries, people also faced the suspension of their rights to take transportation, cross borders, go to school or college, receive certain medical procedures, or enter buildings such as churches and synagogues, restaurants and gyms—if they refused. The FDA asked the judge in the Aaron Siri lawsuit to withhold the release of the Pfizer documents for seventy-five years. Why would a government agency wish to conceal certain material until the present generation, those affected by what is in these documents, is dead and gone? There can be no good answer to that question. Fortunately for history, and fortunately for millions of people whose lives were saved by this decision, the judge refused the FDA’s request, and compelled the release of the documents; a tranche of 55,000 pages per month. When I heard about this, though, I was concerned as a journalist. I knew that no reporter had the bandwidth to go through material of this volume. I also understood that virtually no reporter had the training or skill sets required to understand the multidimensional, technically highly specialized language of the reports. In order to understand the reports, one would need a background in immunology; statistics; biostatistics; pathology; oncology; sports medicine; obstetrics; neurology; cardiology; pharmacology; cellular biology; chemistry; and many other specialties. In addition to doctors and scientists, in order to understand what was really happening in the Pfizer documents, you would also need people deeply knowledgeable about government and pharmaceutical industry regulatory processes; you would need people who understood the FDA approval process; you would need medical fraud specialists; and eventually, in order to understand what crimes were committed in the Papers, you would need lawyers. I was worried that without people with all of those skill sets reading through the documents, their volume and complexity would lead them to vanish down “the memory hole.” Enter Steve Bannon, the former Naval Officer, former Goldman Sachs investment banker, former advisor to President Trump, and current host of the most popular political podcast in America and one of the most listened-to worldwide, WarRoom. He and I come from opposite ends of the political spectrum. I had been a lifelong Democrat, an advisor to President Bill Clinton’s reelection campaign, and to Al Gore’s presidential campaign. He, of course, is a staunch Republican-turned-MAGA. I had been deplatformed in June 2021, before the Pfizer documents came out, for the crime of warning that women were reporting menstrual dysregulation upon having received the mRNA injections. As a career-long writer on women’s sexual and reproductive health issues, I knew that this was a serious danger signal and that this side effect would affect fertility. (Any eighth grader should be able to foresee that as well.) Upon my having posted this warning, I was banned from Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and other platforms. I was attacked globally, all at once, as an “anti-vaxxer” and “conspiracy theorist”; and my life as a well-known, bestselling feminist author, within the legacy media, ended. No one in that world would talk to me anymore, publish my work, or return my calls. I was un-personed. (It turned out, upon two successful lawsuits in 2023 by Missouri and Louisiana attorneys general, that it was actually the White House, the CDC, and senior leaders of other government agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, that unlawfully pressured Twitter and Facebook to remove that cautionary tweet of mine, to shut me down, and to “BOLO” or Be On the Lookout for similar posts. This suppression is now the subject of a pending Supreme Court decision on whether or not it violated the First Amendment.) In this dark time in my life, to my surprise, I received a text from Steve Bannon’s producer, who invited me onto WarRoom. I brought forward my concerns about women’s reproductive health in the wake of mRNA injection, and to my surprise he was respectful, thoughtful about the implications, and took the issue very seriously. I returned again and again, to bring that and other concerns that were emerging in relation to the mRNA injections to his audience. I was relieved to have a platform on which I could share these urgent warnings. At the same time, I was sad that the Left, which was supposed to champion feminism, seemed not to care at all about serious risks to women and unborn babies. I recognized the irony that a person whom I had been taught to believe was the Devil Incarnate, actually cared more about women and babies than did all of my right-on former colleagues, including the feminist health establishment, who had always spoken so loudly about women’s wellbeing and women’s rights. Given my appearances on WarRoom leading up to 2022, it was natural that the subject of the Pfizer documents came up on that show when the documents were released. I shared my concern that they would be lost to history due to their volume and technical language. Bannon said something like, “Well, you will crowdsource a project to read through them.” I was taken aback, as I had zero skills related to, or knowledge about how possibly to do such a thing. I answered something like, “Of course.” So, my news and opinion platform DailyClout was deluged with offers from around the world, from WarRoom listeners with the skill sets needed, to decipher the Pfizer documents. I was terrified. It was chaos. I had excellent people on my team. But none of us knew how to manage or even organize the deluge of emails; we did not know how to evaluate the thousands of CVs; and even once we had “onboarded” these thousands of people, in different time zones, to “the project,” our inboxes became even more terrifying, as it was literally impossible to organize 3,250 experts into an organization chart that could systematically work through these documents. Emails were getting tangled or went unanswered. People asked questions we could not answer. We had no idea what structure could allow such a huge number of disparate experts to work through the vast trove of material. A few weeks in, as I was in despair, Bannon had me on again. He asked about the progress of the project, and I replied, more upbeat than I felt, that many people had joined us, and they were starting to read. “Of course, you will begin delivering reports,” he prompted. “Of course,” I answered, horrified at being in so far over my head. I have never had a corporate job, so it had not even occurred to me that a series of reports was the format that the analyses of the documents should take. Then something happened that I can only describe as providential. We put out a call to the volunteers for a project manager, and Amy Kelly reached out. Ms. Kelly is a Six Sigma-certified project manager, with extensive experience in telecommunications and tech project management. She is also a simply inexplicably effective leader. The day that she put her hand to the chaos in the inboxes, the waters were stilled. Peace and productivity prevailed. Ms. Kelly somehow effortlessly organized the volunteers into six working groups, with a supra-committee at the head of each, and the proper work began. I can only explain the scope and smoothness and effectiveness of the work that followed, as occurring in a state of grace. In the two years since Ms. Kelly and the volunteers have been working together, they have gone through 2,369 documents and data files totaling hundreds of thousands of pages and have issued almost one hundred reports. I taught the volunteers to write these in a language that everyone could understand—which I thought was very important to maximize their impact. And Amy Kelly meticulously revised almost all, and edited all, of them. The first forty-six reports appeared in a self-published format that we put out. It was very important to us that they appear in a published form that was physical, and not just digital, as we wanted something that people could hand to their doctors, their loved ones, their congressional representatives. These forty-six reports broke huge stories. We learned that Pfizer knew within three months after rollout in December 2020, that the vaccines did not work to stop COVID. Pfizer’s language was “vaccine failure” and “failure of efficacy.” One of the most common “adverse events” in the Pfizer documents is “COVID.” Pfizer knew that the vaccine materials—lipid nanoparticles, an industrial fat, coated in polyethylene glycol, a petroleum byproduct; mRNA; and spike protein—did not remain in the deltoid muscle, as claimed by all spokespeople. Rather, it dispersed throughout the body in forty-eight hours “like a shotgun blast,” as one of the authors, Dr. Robert Chandler, put it; it crossed every membrane in the human body—including the blood-brain barrier—and accumulated in the liver, adrenals, spleen, brain, and, if one is a woman, in the ovaries. Dr. Chandler saw no mechanism whereby those materials leave the body, so every injection appears to pack more such materials into organs. Pfizer hired 2,400 fulltime staffers to help process “the large increase of adverse event reports” being submitted to the company’s Worldwide Safety database. Pfizer knew by April 2021 that the injections damaged the hearts of young people. Pfizer knew by February 28, 2021—just ninety days after the public rollout of their COVID vaccine—that its injection was linked to a myriad of adverse events. Far from being “chills,” “fever,” “fatigue,” as the CDC and other authorities claimed were the most worrying side effects, the actual side effects were catastrophically serious. These side effects included: death (which Pfizer does list as a “serious adverse event”). Indeed, over 1,233 deaths in first three months of the drug being publicly available. Severe COVID-19; liver injury; neurological adverse events; facial paralysis; kidney injury; autoimmune diseases; chilblains (a localized form of vasculitis that affects the fingers and toes); multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (when more than one organ system is failing at once); the activation of dormant herpes zoster infections; skin and mucus membrane lesions; respiratory issues; damaged lung structure; respiratory failure; acute respiratory distress syndrome (a lung injury in which fluid leaks from the blood vessels into the lung tissue, causing stiffness which makes it harder to breathe and causes a reduction of oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange); and SARS (or SARS-CoV-1, which had not been seen in the world since 2004, but appears in the Pfizer documents as a side effect of the injections). Thousands of people with arthritis-type joint pain, one of the most common side effect, were recorded. Other thousands with muscle pain, the second most common. Then, industrial-scale blood diseases: blood clots, lung clots, leg clots; thrombotic thrombocytopenia, a clotting disease of the blood vessels; vasculitis (the destruction of blood vessels via inflammation); astronomical rates of neurological disorders—dementias, tremors, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, epilepsies. Horrific skin conditions. A florid plethora of cardiac issues; myocarditis, pericarditis, tachycardia, arrhythmia, and so on. Half of the serious adverse events related to the liver, including death, took place within seventy-two hours of the shot. Half of the strokes took place within forty-eight hours of injection. But what really emerged from the first forty-six reports, was the fact that though COVID is ostensibly a respiratory disease, the papers did not focus on lungs or mucus membranes, but rather they center, creepily and consistently, on disrupting human reproduction. By the time Pfizer’s vaccine rolled out to the public, the pharmaceutical giant knew that they would be killing babies and significantly harming women and men’s reproduction. The material in the documents makes it clear that damaging human’s ability to reproduce and causing spontaneous abortions of babies is “not a bug, it is a feature.” Pfizer told vaccinated men to use two reliable forms of contraception or else to abstain from sex with childbearing-age women. In its protocol, the company defined “exposure” to the vaccine as including skin-to-skin contact, inhalation, and sexual contact. Pfizer mated vaccinated female rats and “untreated” male rats, and then examined those males, females, and their offspring for vaccine-related “toxicity.” Based on just forty-four rats (and no humans), Pfizer declared no negative outcomes for “. . . mating performance, fertility, or any ovarian or uterine parameters . . . nor on embryo-fetal or postnatal survival, growth, or development,” the implication being that its COVID vaccine was safe in pregnancy and did not harm babies. Pfizer knew that lipid nanoparticles have been known for years, to degrade sexual systems, and Amy Kelly in fact found nanoparticles, of which lipid nanoparticles are a subtype, pass through the blood-testis barrier and damage males’ Sertoli cells, Leydig cells, and germ cells. Those are the factories of masculinity, affecting the hormones that turn boys at adolescence into men, with deep voices, broad shoulders, and the ability to father children. So, we have no idea if baby boys born to vaccinated moms, will turn into adults who are recognizably male and fertile. Pfizer enumerated the menstrual damages it knew it was causing to thousands of women, and the damage ranges from women bleeding every day, to having two periods a month, to no periods at all; to women hemorrhaging and passing tissue; to menopausal and post-menopausal women beginning to bleed again. Pfizer’s scientists calmly observed and noted it all but did not tell women. Babies suffered and died. In one section of the documents, over 80 percent of the pregnancies followed resulted in miscarriage or spontaneous abortion. In another section of the documents, two newborn babies died, and Pfizer described the cause of death as “maternal exposure” to the vaccine. Image is from Children’s Health Defense Pfizer knew that vaccine materials entered vaccinated moms’ breast milk and poisoned babies. Four women’s breast milk turned “blue-green.” Pfizer produced a chart of sick babies, made ill from breastfeeding from vaccinated moms, with symptoms ranging from fever to edema (swollen flesh) to hives to vomiting. One poor baby had convulsions and was taken to the ER, where it died of multi-organ system failure. I will now take you to the thirty-six reports you will find in this book. Some of the headlines from the reports that follow are: On Feb 28, 2021, Pfizer produced “Pregnancy and Lactation Cumulative Review” showing that after mothers’ vaccination with its vaccine: * Stroke. * Facial paralysis. * Kidney injury or failure. * The most powerful forces in the world—including the White House, the staffers of the United States president himself; Dr. Rochelle Walensky of the CDC; the head of the FDA, Dr. Robert M Califf; Dr. Anthony Fauci; Twitter and Facebook; legacy media, including the New York Times, the BBC, the Guardian and NPR; OfCom, the British media regulatory agency; professional organizations such as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecology, and the European Medicines Agency, the European equivalent of the FDA, and the Therapeutics Goods Administration, Australia’s equivalent of the FDA—all sought to suppress the information that Amy Kelly, the research volunteers, and I brought to the world starting in 2022, and that you are about to absorb in the following pages. Nonetheless, in spite of the most powerful censorship and retribution campaign launched in human history—made more powerful than past such campaigns by the amplifying effects of social media and AI—these volunteers’ findings were not suppressed at last, and survived on alternative media, and on our site DailyClout.io; to be shared from mouth to mouth, saving millions of lives. Fast forward to more recent events. What has the role of this information been in stopping this greatest crime ever committed against humanity? The worst has happened. Disabilities are up by a million a month in the United States, according to former BlackRock hedge fund manager Edward Dowd. Excess deaths are way up in the US and Western Europe. Birth rates have plummeted, according to the mathematician Igor Chudov (and WarRoom/DailyClout Volunteer Researcher Dr. Robert Chandler) by 13–20 percent since 2021, based on government databases. Athletes are dropping dead. Turbo-cancers are on the rise. Conventional doctors may be “baffled” by all of this, but sadly, we, thanks to Amy Kelly and the volunteers, understand exactly what is happening. Our relentless effort to get this information to the world, in an unimpeachable form, has finally paid off with results. The uptake for boosters is now 4 percent. Very few people “boosted” their children. Most colleges in the United States withdrew their vaccine “mandates.” Pfizer’s net revenue dropped in Q1 of 2024 to pre-2016 levels. OfCom, which had targeted Mark Steyn for “platforming” on his show my description of the reproductive and other harms in the Pfizer documents, is being sued by Steyn. The BBC had to report that vaccine injuries are real, as did the New York Times. AstraZeneca, a somewhat differently configured COVID vaccine in Europe, was withdrawn from the market in May 2024, following lawsuits involving thrombotic thrombocytopenia (a side effect about which our research volunteer Dr. Carol Taccetta had informed the FDA by letter in 2022), and the European Medicines Agency notably withdrew its EUA for AstraZeneca. Three days after we published our report showing that the FDA and CDC had received the eight-page “Pregnancy and Lactation Cumulative Review” confirming that Dr. Walensky knew about the lethality of the vaccine when she held her press conference telling pregnant women to get the injection, Dr. Walensky resigned. It is difficult indeed to face this material in the roles that Amy Kelly and I play. No doubt for the volunteers, unearthing this criminal evidence is painful indeed. It may be hard to read some of what follows. As I have said elsewhere, seeing this material is like being among the Allied soldiers who first opened the gates of Auschwitz. But the truth must be told. Among other important reasons to tell these truths, people were injured and killed with a novel technology not deployed before in medicine; and these pages hold important clues as to the mechanisms of these injuries, and thus, they provide many signposts for physicians and scientists in the future, for treating the many injuries that these new mRNA technologies, injected into people’s bodies, have brought about. We must share the truth, as the truth saves and sustains; and eventually, the truth will heal. * We thank Steve Bannon, and his wonderful team at WarRoom, for being the instigator of this entire project and for consistently bringing us onto his show so that we can tell the world what the volunteers find. We thank Skyhorse Publishing, publisher Tony Lyons, and our editor Hector Carosso, for taking the critical step of publishing this material in a book that will be available everywhere. Books matter, and this publication will make a difference in bringing about accountability and an accurate history of this catastrophic set of events. We thank the volunteers, 3,250 strangers around the world who banded together in the love of truth and of their fellow human beings. We thank our two hundred lawyers, who helped us to FOIA emails from the CDC and helped us to understand the crimes that we were seeing in the following pages. Many of our volunteers themselves have suffered ostracism, job loss, marginalization, and other penalties, as a consequence of their commitment to real science, real medicine, and to bringing forth the truth to save their fellow human beings, and generations yet unborn. * The battle is ongoing. No one who committed this massive crime against humanity is in jail, or even facing civil or criminal charges. There are at least three lawsuits against Pfizer—two of ours, and one of Brook Jackson’s—but, to date, none of the lawsuits have completely prevailed. The litigation drags on. Nonetheless—nonetheless. The word is out. Amy Kelly and I get hundreds of emails from grateful families, telling us about their healthy babies or grandchildren and thanking us for saving those babies, or sons and daughters and daughters-in-law, and we know this project has saved many lives; perhaps hundreds of thousands of lives and maybe saved millions from disabling injuries. Steve Bannon, who started it all, saved hundreds of thousands of lives and saved his listeners and ours from sustaining millions of injuries. God know how many babies will be born in the future, safe and well, because of our collective, arduous, much-targeted work. The story of this project is not over. Your own actions, upon your having read these reports, are part of the ongoing ripples of this work. Whom will you tell? How will you process the information? What will you do to avenge the crimes of the past? What will you do to save the future? * Click the share button below to email/forward this article to your friends and colleagues.

Global Times Economic coercion and blackmail underscores Washington's hegemonic mindset: expert By Ma Jingjing Published: Apr 09, 2025 12:23 AM Chinese Foreign Ministry and Commerce Ministry on Tuesday vowed to take countermeasures to safeguard rights and interests, in response to US President Donald Trump's recent claims of escalating tariffs unless China withdrew its retaliatory tariffs against the US by April 8. In a post on Truth Social on Monday, the US president has threatened China with an extra 50 percent tariff on goods imported into the US if China does not withdraw its 34 percent counter-tariff on US products, according to CNBC. "We will not let anyone take away the Chinese people's legitimate right to development. We will not tolerate any attempt to harm China's sovereignty, security and development interests. We will continue to take resolute and strong measures to safeguard our legitimate rights and interests," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said in response at the regular Foreign Ministry press conference on Tuesday. Lin said that judging from its actions, the US doesn't seem to be serious about having talks right now. "If the US truly wants to talk, it should let people see that they're ready to treat others with equality, respect and mutual benefit. If the US decides not to care about the interests of the US itself, China and the rest of the world, and is determined to fight a tariff and trade war, China's response will continue to the end," Lin said. In a statement published on its website on Tuesday, China's Commerce Ministry said China will resolutely take countermeasures to safeguard its rights and interests should the US escalate its tariff measures. Citing sources or experts, Niutanqin, one of the self-media accounts, posted on Tuesday that China could take six possible measures against the US' tariffs, including significantly increasing tariffs on US agricultural products such as soybeans and sorghum, banning US poultry imports, suspending China-US cooperation on fentanyl-related issues, imposing curbs on services trade with the US, reducing or banning the import of US films, and investigating the intellectual property benefits of US companies operating in China. China will continue to take resolute measures to safeguard its legitimate and lawful rights and interests, Lin said on Tuesday, noting that the ministry does not comment on what's been said on the internet. Escalated pressure While showing no intention to pause the sweeping "reciprocal tariffs," Trump continues to intensify pressure on its trade partners including China, the EU, Japan and Canada. "The European Union's been very bad to us," Trump told reporters at the White House, accusing European nations of not buying enough US goods. "They're going to have to buy their energy from us, because they need it and they're going to have to buy it from us. They can buy it, we can knock off $350 billion in one week," Reuters reported, citing the US president. On Monday evening, the European Commission proposed its first retaliatory tariffs at 25 percent on a range of US imports in response to Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs, Reuters reported, citing an internal document. The tariffs on some goods will take effect on May 16 and others later in the year, on December 1, the document said, Reuters reported. In addition, Trump wrote in another post on Truth Social on Monday that Japan has "treated the US very poorly on Trade. They don't take our cars, but we take MILLIONS of theirs." The US Department of Commerce, as part of an annual review process, plans to hike duties on Canadian lumber from 14.4 percent to 34.45 percent, CNN reported on Monday, citing published and unpublished filings in the Federal Register. "The economic coercion and blackmail underscores Washington's hegemonic mindset - seeking 'America First' and 'American exceptionalism' by forcing others to make sacrifices," He Weiwen, a senior fellow at the Center for China and Globalization, told the Global Times on Tuesday. The US' unilateral and protectionist behaviors run counter to the WTO's multilateral trading rules as well as other countries' legitimate rights and interests, He said, stressing that China's resolute countermeasures against US bullying are necessary to safeguard true multilateralism and maintain the multilateral trading system. Self-inflicted isolation "By imposing high tariffs on all of its trade partners, including China, the US risks trade and economic isolation," Yu Miaojie, president of Liaoning University, told the Global Times on Tuesday. In the short term, global trade may be adversely affected and global growth may be dragged down. However, the US' tariffs will have limited impact on China's exports, given that the country has made efforts to diversify export destinations over the past several years and form a new pattern of all-round opening-up in various fields and sectors, Yu said. "Instead, US tariffs will lead to higher prices, adding to inflationary pressure while slowing US economic growth," he said. Larry Fink, CEO of US multinational investment firm BlackRock, said US stock markets could fall another 20 percent as steep US tariffs will lead some investors to believe the US economy may already be contracting, Reuters reported. "Most CEOs I talk to would say we are probably in a recession right now," Fink told the Economic Club of New York on Monday, Reuters said. Ken Langone, co-founder of US home improvement specialty retailer Home Depot, blasted the tariffs, describing the 34 percent tariff rate on China as "too aggressive, too soon," the Financial Times reported. "I believe he's been poorly advised by his advisers about this trade situation - and the formula they're applying," said Langone The US Chamber of Commerce, which represents millions of US businesses big and small but which is heavily funded by industry titans, is considering suing the Trump administration to block the implementation of Trump's new tariffs set to go into effect Wednesday, Fortune reported on Tuesday, citing sources with direct knowledge of the discussions. The US Chamber could argue that Trump's invocation of emergency powers to impose the new tariffs is illegal. Last week a nonprofit called New Civil Liberties Alliance took a similar approach, filing suit on behalf of a small business owner who imports goods from China, arguing that the US President did not have the legal authority to impose his February tariffs on China, according to the report. "Faced with the US' bullying practices, all other economies will have to figure out how to overcome challenges. Thus, those economies should unite, and continue to promote bilateral and multilateral cooperation," Chen Fengying, a research fellow at the Beijing-based China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, told the Global Times on Tuesday. China's Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) hosted a roundtable meeting with US-funded companies on Sunday, reaffirming the country's commitment to reform and opening-up amid global trade tensions, according to a statement on the MOFCOM website on Monday. Regardless of global uncertainties, China remains resolute in its path toward reform and opening-up, Ling Ji, vice minister of commerce and deputy China international trade representative, said at the meeting, noting that multilateralism is the inevitable solution to the challenges facing the world and that China's door to the outside world will only open wider.

Title: US will not let China disrupt Panama Canal: Pentagon chief

Hegseth is the second senior US official to visit Panama since President Donald Trump took office in January vowing to "take back" the US-built canal to counter what he sees as China's influence over the waterway. "Today, the Panama Canal faces ongoing threats," Hegseth said in a speech at a police station located at the entry to the shipping route. "The United States of America will not allow communist China or any other country to threaten the canal's operation or integrity," he added. The United States built the more than century-old canal and handed it over to Panama in 1999. Hegseth met with Panama's President Jose Raul Mulino, with the two issuing a joint statement that affirmed security ties -- though there was a notable discrepancy in the versions released by both sides on the issue of Panama's sovereignty over the canal. "Secretary Hegseth recognized Panama's leadership and inalienable sovereignty over the Panama Canal and its adjacent areas," read a Spanish-language statement released by Mulino's office. That sentence did not appear in the English-language statement released by the US government. - 'Wonder of the world' - A Hong Kong company operates two ports at either end of the canal connecting the Atlantic and Pacific, through which five percent of all global shipping passes. The Trump administration has put immense pressure on Panama to reduce what it calls Chinese influence on the canal, which Washington sees as a threat to US national security. Panama has denied the assertions that China exercises undue control over the waterway, but its protests on the subject have grown weaker and on the eve of Hegseth's visit it accused the Hong Kong company of failing to meet its contractual obligations. "I want to be very clear. China did not build this canal. China does not operate this canal. And China will not weaponize this canal," Hegseth said, calling it a "wonder of the world." Speaking alongside Mulino, Hegseth said the US and Panama together would "take back the Panama Canal from China's influence" and keep it open to all nations, using the "deterrent power of the strongest, most effective and most lethal fighting force in the world." He claimed that China's control of critical infrastructure in the canal area gave Beijing the power to conduct spying activities across Panama, making Panama and the United States "less secure, less prosperous and less sovereign." The Chinese Embassy in Panama issued a statement refuting Hegseth's claim that Beijing interferes in the operations of the canal. "China has never taken part in the management or operation of the Panama Canal, nor has it interfered in issues" concerning the waterway, the statement said, calling on Washington to halt "blackmail" and "plundering" of Panama and other countries of the region. It labeled Hegseth's comments "not at all responsible or founded" and said the United States "has orchestrated a sensationalist campaign based on the 'China threat theory' so as to undermine cooperation between China and Panama." It added: "China has always respected Panama's sovereignty with regard to the canal." - Pressure on port company - The concession to the HK-based company's subsidiary to operate Balboa port on the Pacific side of the canal and Cristobal port on the Atlantic side was first granted in 1997 and renewed for another 25 years in 2021. But faced with Trump's repeated threats to seize the canal, Panama has put pressure on CK Hutchison to pull out of the country. In January, it began an audit of Panama Ports -- the subsidiary -- to determine if it was honoring its concession contract. On the eve of Hegseth's visit Panama's comptroller announced that the audit had revealed "many breaches" of the contract and said Panama did not receive $1.2 billion it was owed from the operator. In March, CK Hutchison announced an agreement to sell 43 ports in 23 countries -- including its two on canal -- to a group led by giant US asset manager BlackRock for $19 billion in cash. A furious Beijing has since announced an antitrust review of the deal, which likely prevented the parties from signing an agreement on April 2 as had been planned. Hegseth's visit to Panama comes two months after that of US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Shortly after that visit Panama announced it was pulling out of Chinese President Xi Jinping's landmark global infrastructure program, the Belt and Road Initiative. Hong Kong firm did not uphold Panama Canal ports contract: Panama auditPanama City (AFP) April 8, 2025 - The Hong Kong firm in charge of two key Panama Canal ports has flouted the terms of its contract, according to a Panamanian audit released Monday, as US and Chinese firms fight for business on the waterway after President Donald Trump threatened to seize it. The audit found "many breaches" of the concession awarded to a subsidiary of logistics giant CK Hutchison to operate the two ports, and concluded that Panama did not receive $1.2 billion it was owed under the contract. The subsidiary, called Panama Ports, benefited from many tax exemptions and also had irregularities in a previous audit that was used to justify an extension of the concession first awarded in 1997, said state comptroller Anel Flores. "This is a very delicate issue," Flores told journalists, adding that he would file a complaint with prosecutors in the coming days over the unpaid concession fees. The release of the audit results came hours before US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth arrived in Panama, which has come under strong pressure from Trump to reduce Chinese influence on the US-built canal. The United States has said it is a threat to its national security -- and the region as a whole -- for a Hong Kong company to operate ports at either end of the canal connecting the Atlantic and Pacific, through which five percent of all global shipping passes. Hegseth will meet Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino on Tuesday and visit the canal, which opened in 1914. He will also participate in a security conference with Central American officials. Although the waterway has been under Panamanian control since 1999 under international treaties, Trump has threatened to take it back, by force if necessary, arguing that it is effectively controlled by Beijing. - Trump threats - Flores on Monday denied that the announcement of Panama Ports failing to honor the concession contract had anything to do with the Hegseth visit. "This is an autonomous act by Panama," Flores said. However, some analysts had predicted that this audit would in fact purport to show irregularities, so that Panama could strip the Chinese company of the contract and thus appease the Trump administration. "It comes as a surprise to no one that the audit turns up alleged irregularities, since the idea was to have some kind of legal justification strong enough to cancel the concession," Euclides Tapia, a professor of international relations, told AFP. The state comptroller's office is an autonomous body that examines how government money is spent. It began the audit of Panama Ports in late January to determine if it was honoring the concession contract, after Trump threatened to take over the canal. Faced with the US president's repeated threats, the Central American country in turn has put pressure on CK Hutchison to relinquish its control of the ports. In March, the firm announced an agreement to sell 43 ports in 23 countries -- including its two on the interoceanic Panama Canal -- to a group led by US giant asset manager BlackRock for $19 billion in cash. A furious Beijing has since announced an antitrust review of the deal, which likely prevented the parties from signing an agreement on April 2 as had been planned.

Panama has denied the assertions that China exercises undue control over the waterway, but its protests on the subject have grown weaker and on the eve of Hegseth's visit it accused the Hong Kong company of failing to meet its contractual obligations. "I want to be very clear. China did not build this canal. China does not operate this canal. And China will not weaponize this canal," Hegseth said, calling it a "wonder of the world." Speaking alongside Mulino, Hegseth said the US and Panama together would "take back the Panama Canal from China's influence" and keep it open to all nations, using the "deterrent power of the strongest, most effective and most lethal fighting force in the world." He claimed that China's control of critical infrastructure in the canal area gave Beijing the power to conduct spying activities across Panama, making Panama and the United States "less secure, less prosperous and less sovereign." The Chinese Embassy in Panama issued a statement refuting Hegseth's claim that Beijing interferes in the operations of the canal. "China has never taken part in the management or operation of the Panama Canal, nor has it interfered in issues" concerning the waterway, the statement said, calling on Washington to halt "blackmail" and "plundering" of Panama and other countries of the region. It labeled Hegseth's comments "not at all responsible or founded" and said the United States "has orchestrated a sensationalist campaign based on the 'China threat theory' so as to undermine cooperation between China and Panama."

Hong Kong firm did not uphold Panama Canal ports contract: Panama auditPanama City (AFP) April 8, 2025 - The Hong Kong firm in charge of two key Panama Canal ports has flouted the terms of its contract, according to a Panamanian audit released Monday, as US and Chinese firms fight for business on the waterway after President Donald Trump threatened to seize it. The audit found "many breaches" of the concession awarded to a subsidiary of logistics giant CK Hutchison to operate the two ports, and concluded that Panama did not receive $1.2 billion it was owed under the contract.

The Trump administration has put immense pressure on Panama to reduce what it calls Chinese influence on the canal, which Washington sees as a threat to US national security. Panama has denied the assertions that China exercises undue control over the waterway, but its protests on the subject have grown weaker and on the eve of Hegseth's visit it accused the Hong Kong company of failing to meet its contractual obligations. "I want to be very clear. China did not build this canal. China does not operate this canal. And China will not weaponize this canal," Hegseth said, calling it a "wonder of the world." Speaking alongside Mulino, Hegseth said the US and Panama together would "take back the Panama Canal from China's influence" and keep it open to all nations, using the "deterrent power of the strongest, most effective and most lethal fighting force in the world." He claimed that China's control of critical infrastructure in the canal area gave Beijing the power to conduct spying activities across Panama, making Panama and the United States "less secure, less prosperous and less sovereign." The Chinese Embassy in Panama issued a statement refuting Hegseth's claim that Beijing interferes in the operations of the canal. "China has never taken part in the management or operation of the Panama Canal, nor has it interfered in issues" concerning the waterway, the statement said, calling on Washington to halt "blackmail" and "plundering" of Panama and other countries of the region. It labeled Hegseth's comments "not at all responsible or founded" and said the United States "has orchestrated a sensationalist campaign based on the 'China threat theory' so as to undermine cooperation between China and Panama." It added: "China has always respected Panama's sovereignty with regard to the canal." - Pressure on port company - The concession to the HK-based company's subsidiary to operate Balboa port on the Pacific side of the canal and Cristobal port on the Atlantic side was first granted in 1997 and renewed for another 25 years in 2021. But faced with Trump's repeated threats to seize the canal, Panama has put pressure on CK Hutchison to pull out of the country. In January, it began an audit of Panama Ports -- the subsidiary -- to determine if it was honoring its concession contract. On the eve of Hegseth's visit Panama's comptroller announced that the audit had revealed "many breaches" of the contract and said Panama did not receive $1.2 billion it was owed from the operator.

Hong Kong firm did not uphold Panama Canal ports contract: Panama auditPanama City (AFP) April 8, 2025 - The Hong Kong firm in charge of two key Panama Canal ports has flouted the terms of its contract, according to a Panamanian audit released Monday, as US and Chinese firms fight for business on the waterway after President Donald Trump threatened to seize it. The audit found "many breaches" of the concession awarded to a subsidiary of logistics giant CK Hutchison to operate the two ports, and concluded that Panama did not receive $1.2 billion it was owed under the contract. The subsidiary, called Panama Ports, benefited from many tax exemptions and also had irregularities in a previous audit that was used to justify an extension of the concession first awarded in 1997, said state comptroller Anel Flores. "This is a very delicate issue," Flores told journalists, adding that he would file a complaint with prosecutors in the coming days over the unpaid concession fees. The release of the audit results came hours before US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth arrived in Panama, which has come under strong pressure from Trump to reduce Chinese influence on the US-built canal. The United States has said it is a threat to its national security -- and the region as a whole -- for a Hong Kong company to operate ports at either end of the canal connecting the Atlantic and Pacific, through which five percent of all global shipping passes. Hegseth will meet Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino on Tuesday and visit the canal, which opened in 1914. He will also participate in a security conference with Central American officials. Although the waterway has been under Panamanian control since 1999 under international treaties, Trump has threatened to take it back, by force if necessary, arguing that it is effectively controlled by Beijing. - Trump threats - Flores on Monday denied that the announcement of Panama Ports failing to honor the concession contract had anything to do with the Hegseth visit. "This is an autonomous act by Panama," Flores said. However, some analysts had predicted that this audit would in fact purport to show irregularities, so that Panama could strip the Chinese company of the contract and thus appease the Trump administration. "It comes as a surprise to no one that the audit turns up alleged irregularities, since the idea was to have some kind of legal justification strong enough to cancel the concession," Euclides Tapia, a professor of international relations, told AFP.

Hong Kong firm did not uphold Panama Canal ports contract: Panama auditPanama City (AFP) April 8, 2025 - The Hong Kong firm in charge of two key Panama Canal ports has flouted the terms of its contract, according to a Panamanian audit released Monday, as US and Chinese firms fight for business on the waterway after President Donald Trump threatened to seize it. The audit found "many breaches" of the concession awarded to a subsidiary of logistics giant CK Hutchison to operate the two ports, and concluded that Panama did not receive $1.2 billion it was owed under the contract. The subsidiary, called Panama Ports, benefited from many tax exemptions and also had irregularities in a previous audit that was used to justify an extension of the concession first awarded in 1997, said state comptroller Anel Flores. "This is a very delicate issue," Flores told journalists, adding that he would file a complaint with prosecutors in the coming days over the unpaid concession fees. The release of the audit results came hours before US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth arrived in Panama, which has come under strong pressure from Trump to reduce Chinese influence on the US-built canal. The United States has said it is a threat to its national security -- and the region as a whole -- for a Hong Kong company to operate ports at either end of the canal connecting the Atlantic and Pacific, through which five percent of all global shipping passes. Hegseth will meet Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino on Tuesday and visit the canal, which opened in 1914. He will also participate in a security conference with Central American officials. Although the waterway has been under Panamanian control since 1999 under international treaties, Trump has threatened to take it back, by force if necessary, arguing that it is effectively controlled by Beijing. - Trump threats - Flores on Monday denied that the announcement of Panama Ports failing to honor the concession contract had anything to do with the Hegseth visit. "This is an autonomous act by Panama," Flores said. However, some analysts had predicted that this audit would in fact purport to show irregularities, so that Panama could strip the Chinese company of the contract and thus appease the Trump administration. "It comes as a surprise to no one that the audit turns up alleged irregularities, since the idea was to have some kind of legal justification strong enough to cancel the concession," Euclides Tapia, a professor of international relations, told AFP.

"This is a very delicate issue," Flores told journalists, adding that he would file a complaint with prosecutors in the coming days over the unpaid concession fees. The release of the audit results came hours before US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth arrived in Panama, which has come under strong pressure from Trump to reduce Chinese influence on the US-built canal. The United States has said it is a threat to its national security -- and the region as a whole -- for a Hong Kong company to operate ports at either end of the canal connecting the Atlantic and Pacific, through which five percent of all global shipping passes. Hegseth will meet Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino on Tuesday and visit the canal, which opened in 1914. He will also participate in a security conference with Central American officials. Although the waterway has been under Panamanian control since 1999 under international treaties, Trump has threatened to take it back, by force if necessary, arguing that it is effectively controlled by Beijing. - Trump threats - Flores on Monday denied that the announcement of Panama Ports failing to honor the concession contract had anything to do with the Hegseth visit. "This is an autonomous act by Panama," Flores said. However, some analysts had predicted that this audit would in fact purport to show irregularities, so that Panama could strip the Chinese company of the contract and thus appease the Trump administration. "It comes as a surprise to no one that the audit turns up alleged irregularities, since the idea was to have some kind of legal justification strong enough to cancel the concession," Euclides Tapia, a professor of international relations, told AFP. The state comptroller's office is an autonomous body that examines how government money is spent. It began the audit of Panama Ports in late January to determine if it was honoring the concession contract, after Trump threatened to take over the canal. Faced with the US president's repeated threats, the Central American country in turn has put pressure on CK Hutchison to relinquish its control of the ports. In March, the firm announced an agreement to sell 43 ports in 23 countries -- including its two on the interoceanic Panama Canal -- to a group led by US giant asset manager BlackRock for $19 billion in cash. A furious Beijing has since announced an antitrust review of the deal, which likely prevented the parties from signing an agreement on April 2 as had been planned. The Panama Ports concession to operate Balboa port on the Pacific side of the canal and Cristobal port on the Atlantic side was renewed for another 25 years in 2021. fj/cb/dw-sco/rsc BLACKROCK Related Links Global Trade News On the eve of Hegseth's visit Panama's comptroller announced that the audit had revealed "many breaches" of the contract and said Panama did not receive $1.2 billion it was owed from the operator.

"This is an autonomous act by Panama," Flores said. However, some analysts had predicted that this audit would in fact purport to show irregularities, so that Panama could strip the Chinese company of the contract and thus appease the Trump administration. "It comes as a surprise to no one that the audit turns up alleged irregularities, since the idea was to have some kind of legal justification strong enough to cancel the concession," Euclides Tapia, a professor of international relations, told AFP. The state comptroller's office is an autonomous body that examines how government money is spent. It began the audit of Panama Ports in late January to determine if it was honoring the concession contract, after Trump threatened to take over the canal. Faced with the US president's repeated threats, the Central American country in turn has put pressure on CK Hutchison to relinquish its control of the ports. In March, the firm announced an agreement to sell 43 ports in 23 countries -- including its two on the interoceanic Panama Canal -- to a group led by US giant asset manager BlackRock for $19 billion in cash. A furious Beijing has since announced an antitrust review of the deal, which likely prevented the parties from signing an agreement on April 2 as had been planned. The Panama Ports concession to operate Balboa port on the Pacific side of the canal and Cristobal port on the Atlantic side was renewed for another 25 years in 2021. fj/cb/dw-sco/rsc BLACKROCK Related Links Global Trade News Hegseth will meet Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino on Tuesday and visit the canal, which opened in 1914.
