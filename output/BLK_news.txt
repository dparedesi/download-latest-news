We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI Stocks Taking Wall Street by Storm. In this article, we are going to take a look at where International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) stands against the other AI stocks. Wall Street's major indexes closed lower on Monday, December 9th, dragged down by a decline in Nvidia. The plunge pressured the broader technology sector, with investors also turning their attention to an important inflation report due this week. READ NOW: Top 10 AI News Stories For The Weekend and 15 Buzzing AI Stocks Making Headlines Investors expect the consumer price index (CPI) data set to be released on Wednesday, while the producer price index (PPI) is anticipated on Thursday, ahead of the Federal Reserve's meeting on Dec. 17-18. The plunge, however, seems only temporary, and technology stocks are poised to gain in the future. BlackRock anticipates that infrastructure and cybersecurity investments will "shine" in 2025. Jay Jacobs, the firm’s U.S. head of thematic and active ETFs, considers the artificial intelligence boom as a major catalyst. Jacobs said that AI companies need to build out their data centers and that keeping that data safe is also a sound investment play for the New Year. “If you think about your data, you want to spend more on cybersecurity as it gets more valuable. We think this is really going to benefit the cybersecurity [and the] software community which is seeing very rapid revenue growth based off of this AI.” Jacobs further stated that even though technology may seem tangible, it is also heavily reliant on physical infrastructure such as energy, materials like copper, and even real estate. These real-world components are essential for supporting the systems that are used every day. He further went on to say that it’s not just the mega-cap tech names that are winning, other semiconductor companies and other data center companies are benefiting from the rise of this theme. In this regard, AI ETFs can play a significant role in helping investors gain targeted exposure while mitigating some of the risks associated with investing in individual AI stocks. They are a smart way for investors to invest in a theme for seeking longer-term gains. “Identifying future winners can be very difficult – it’s not always the obvious names that make it in the long-term”. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A closeup of a woman's hands typing rapidly on a laptop in a corporate office setting. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 56 International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is a multinational technology company offering AI consulting services and a suite of AI software products. On December 9, the company announced that it has unveiled revolutionary research in optics technology that has the potential to improve how data centers train and run generative AI models. The process would enable co-packaged optics (CPO), the next generation of optics technology, to enable connectivity within data centers at the speed of light through optics that would complement existing short-reach electrical wires. The research innovation would enable various benefits including lower costs for scaling generative AI, faster AI model training, and increased energy efficiency for data centers. “As generative AI demands more energy and processing power, the data center must evolve – and co-packaged optics can make these data centers future-proof. With this breakthrough, tomorrow’s chips will communicate much like how fiber optics cables carry data in and out of data centers, ushering in a new era of faster, more sustainable communications that can handle the AI workloads of the future.” Overall IBM ranks 5th on our list of the AI stocks that are taking Wall Street by storm. While we acknowledge the potential of IBM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than IBM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: How is it we know more about Luigi Mangione than we do about Thomas Crooks?

Within hours of his apprehension in Pennsylvania in connection with the cold-blooded murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, scads of information rolled out about the life and times of suspect Luigi Mangione, the 26-year-old man who has been accused of the killing, and in a very short period of time, the Internet being a fast medium. We've seen pictures of his family, and heard their statements of shock and regret at the news. We learned he grew up wealthy, the son of the owner of two resorts near Baltimore. We learned he once worked in a nursing home owned by his family. We learned where he went to school, even high school where he was a valedictorian, and that he was quite accomplished in the difficult subjects of computer science and engineering at an Ivy League university. We've heard from his friends, who say he was normal and outgoing, with some even seeing leadership qualities in him. We learned he was athletic and outdoorsy, enjoying hiking and surfing. We learned he was well traveled, living as a digital nomad in Hawaii, traveling to Japan, living in San Francisco, as well as Pennsylvania and Maryland in his life earlier. We learned about his online presence through his many social media accounts, posting pictures of his ripped physique, liking the Unabomber, disliking Jordan Peterson, getting into deep philosophical discussions with others. We learned about his surfing accident which led to back surgery, leaving him with four pins in his back, apparent pictures of which he posted on his social media bannerheads. We even learned that, according to a friend, that the surgery made it too painful for him to have sexual relations ever again, which he resented. We learned of his obsessive dislike for the health insurance industry -- and can only recall that involuntary eunuchs have been known to take revenge on their tormentors. We learned about his manifesto which was picked up by the cops when they apprehended him, and it seems to have been leaked already into the Internet, railing against the health care industry. So there's quite a lot of information out there, and this synopsis is far from complete. That, in addition to the details of the murder and the details of the apprehension, presents a pretty comprehensive picture. It's in striking contrast to the last high-profile killer who came to our attention last July, Thomas Crooks, another young man with a similar background who got his name in the news for attempting to kill President Trump amid a sea of Secret Service incompetence, but did manage to murder an innocent firefighter who was nearby, and injure two others in addition to President Trump, before he was shot dead by a cop. His age was similar, his engineering background was similar, his working in a nursing home was similar But we hear nothing of the level of information Mangione got from this miserable freak -- little about his political motivations, which political party he identified with, what his political views were, who his friends were, nothing about his very strange family who threw away their silverware to prevent police from finding it in a home search after the killing and attempted assassination, nothing about the strange associated classmates who could have been involved in the attack. We know nothing about the strange ad he made for Blackrock, or the 18 burner phones in his backpack. We don't know who he was talking to on the phone, seen in a video, before he launched into his assassination bid. If he had a manifesto, we haven't seen it. And his social media accounts were quickly scrubbed and shut down. Now, some of this can be explained away by Mangione having an internet presence and being a non-misfit socially, which made more information available generally. But that doesn't explain all of it. Where are the classmates who knew him? Why is his family so silent? Why has his social media presence been suppressed? And why is the Secret Service seemingly going out of its way to obstruct Congress? There have been quite a few shouting matches at this point. Even less information is available about a second apparent wannabe-assassin of Trump in Florida a few weeks later, accused gunman Ryan Routh.We know he was a loser of some kind, having no money and living in a shambling house in Hawaii (as Mangione did). We don't know how he got a lot of money to travel around trailing Trump from North Carolina to Florida. There is some information about his inchoate political views, which like everything else about him, is fragmented. The guess one can make for this assymetrical distribution of information is that the press and the government investigating the assassination attempts hates Trump, and may even be implicated in the assasination attempts, as if in a coverup. By contrast, most people are pretty appalled about the cold-blooded murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York. That may explain why so little information about the attempts on Trump are out there in contrast to Mangione. They'd rather sweep it under the rug. It's hard to say with certainly what this is about, but it's just strange that some information gets out more readily about major events than others. Funny how it's the information we want most.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best American Dividend Stocks To Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) stands against the other American dividend stocks. The US economy expanded by 2.8% in the third quarter of 2024, as reported in the Advance GDP release from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. This marked the ninth straight quarter of growth in real GDP. While the third-quarter increase was robust, it slightly lagged behind the 3% growth recorded in the second quarter of 2024. Economists polled by Dow Jones had anticipated a 3.1% rise. Regardless of market conditions, investors frequently seek to minimize risk in their portfolios, and investing in dividend stocks is a reliable approach to achieve this. A report by S&P Dow Jones Indices highlighted the growing significance of dividends as a source of personal income. Over time, dividend income has steadily risen, increasing from 2.68% in the fourth quarter of 1980 to 7.88% in the second quarter of 2024. In contrast, interest income has seen a decline, dropping from 14.58% to 7.61% during the same period. Also read: 8 Best Dividend Kings To Invest In For Safe Dividend Growth The Dividend Aristocrat Index, which tracks the performance of companies with 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, has surged by over 10% since the start of 2024, underperforming the market. Although dividend stocks may not have been hitting it out of the park this year, US companies have remained dedicated to rewarding shareholders by consistently paying dividends. According to a report by S&P Dow Jones, for the 12-month period ending in September 2024, US common dividend increases totaled $74.7 billion, marking a 16.9% rise from the $63.9 billion recorded in the same period a year earlier, ending in September 2023. The report also mentioned that in the third quarter of 2024, there were 480 dividend increases reported, marking a 7.1% rise compared to the 448 increases in the same period in 2023. The total value of these dividend hikes amounted to $14.1 billion for the quarter. WisdomTree offers an interesting perspective on global dividends in its report. According to their findings, the global equity market currently distributes around $1.6 trillion in dividends, an increase from approximately $1.5 trillion last year. Notably, 55% of these dividends come from outside the US, which is about 15% more than the non-US share in market cap-weighted indexes. On the other hand, US companies account for 44% of global dividends, which is considerably less than their 63% share of global market capitalization. This suggests that non-US markets are more heavily weighted in dividend-focused indexes, while US exposure is relatively lower. For instance, European countries make up about a quarter of global dividend payments, which is 10% more than their share of the global market cap. That said, the start of dividend payments by several major US tech companies contributed an additional 1.1 percentage points to the global growth rate in Q2, as reported by Janus Henderson’s Global Dividend Index report. The report also mentioned that the contribution from these new dividend payers will persist throughout the remainder of the year, ensuring that US payout growth remains ahead of the global average. In view of this, let’s take a look at some of the best American dividend stocks. Our Methodology: We created this list by scanning Insider Monkey's Q3 2024 database for US companies that have consistently increased their dividends for at least 10 years and are traded on American stock exchanges. Then, we chose stocks with dividend yields above 2% as of December 10. Finally, we selected the top 8 companies with the most hedge fund investors in Q3 2024 from the refined dataset. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A home improvement store overflowing with a variety of products and supplies. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 82 The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) is an American multinational home improvement retail company that sells appliances, tools, construction equipment, and related products. The company faced challenges this year due to increasing macroeconomic uncertainty, which dampened overall consumer demand and led to reduced spending on home improvement projects. In its latest quarter, it reported a 1.3% decline in same-store sales compared to the previous year—an unfavorable outcome for any retail-focused business. Management anticipates this downward trend will persist for the remainder of the fiscal year. That said, the stock has surged by over 22.4% since the start of 2024. This was also highlighted by Carillon Tower Advisers in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say: “While Home Depot, Inc.’s (NYSE:HD) recent reported earnings were somewhat tepid, the market seems to be pricing in an inversion of the company’s sales, driven by lower interest rates. Home Depot reported its seventh consecutive quarter of same-store sales declines, giving back substantial gains that it enjoyed during the pandemic. High mortgage rates have also put a damper on existing home sales. People typically spend the most on home repairs and improvements in years when they buy or sell houses, often conducting both transactions in the same year.” In the third quarter of 2024, The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) reported revenue of $40.22 billion, which showed a 6.6% growth from the same period last year. The company's operating income came in at $5.4 billion and its operating margin was 13.5%. It experienced improved customer interest in seasonal products and various outdoor projects, along with additional sales driven by demand related to hurricane activity. In the first nine months of the year, The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) generated over $15 billion in operating cash flow. The company's strong cash position makes it a generous dividend payer. The company currently pays a quarterly dividend of $2.25 per share and has a dividend yield of 2.13%, as of December 10. It is one of the best dividend stocks on our list as the company has raised its payouts for 14 consecutive years. According to Insider Monkey's database of Q3 2024, 82 hedge funds owned stakes in The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD), down from 86 in the preceding quarter. These stakes are worth nearly $7.6 billion in total. Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management owned the largest stake in the company. Overall HD ranks 3rd on our list of the best American dividend stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential for HD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than HD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

(NYSE:PFE) is an American multinational pharmaceutical and biotech company. Its recent success, driven by its COVID-19 vaccine and treatment pill, has left some investors viewing it as a stock past its prime. With demand for the vaccine declining sharply, concerns have emerged about possible shifts in vaccine policy under the incoming Trump administration, adding to investor apprehensions. Since the start of 2024, the stock has fallen by over 13%. That said, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) reported strong earnings in the most recent quarter. The company posted revenue of $17.7 billion, which showed a significant 32% growth from the same period last year. It sustained remarkable growth in its Oncology portfolio, with significant revenue contributions from products such as Padcev, Xtandi, Lorbrena, and Braftovi/Mektovi. Additionally, it successfully met increased demand for Paxlovid during the recent surge in COVID-19 cases. In the first nine months of 2024, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) returned $7.1 billion to shareholders through dividends. The company's quarterly dividend comes in at $0.42 per share and has an attractive dividend yield of 6.51%, as of December 10. It is one of the best dividend stocks on our list as the company has been growing its payouts for 14 consecutive years. Parnassus Investments highlighted Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) in its Q1 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say: “During the quarter, we added new positions in Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), NICE and Charter Communications. We purchased Pfizer to capture the potential upside from any turnaround following the COVID-induced boom-bust cycle of the last few years. Pfizer’s stock price sank by more than 40% in 2023 as COVID-19 vaccine revenues rolled off, providing an attractive entry point for us. The company completed its acquisition of Seagen, which should strengthen Pfizer’s pipeline in antibody-drug conjugates (ADC). Pfizer also offers an attractive dividend yield.” As per Insider Monkey's database of Q3 2024, 80 hedge funds held stakes in Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), compared with 84 in the previous quarter. The total value of these stakes is more than $3 billion. Among these hedge funds, Two Sigma Advisors was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3.

The report also mentioned that the contribution from these new dividend payers will persist throughout the remainder of the year, ensuring that US payout growth remains ahead of the global average. In view of this, let’s take a look at some of the best American dividend stocks. Our Methodology: We created this list by scanning Insider Monkey's Q3 2024 database for US companies that have consistently increased their dividends for at least 10 years and are traded on American stock exchanges. Then, we chose stocks with dividend yields above 2% as of December 10. Finally, we selected the top 8 companies with the most hedge fund investors in Q3 2024 from the refined dataset. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 72 Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is an American multinational telecommunications company that offers a wide range of related services and products to its consumers. The stock is down by over 11% since the start of 2024. The company's performance has been lackluster, as investors have found little motivation to invest in it this year. Despite reporting solid earnings in the latest quarter, the results failed to captivate investors, as they were viewed as merely a temporary improvement rather than a long-term growth indicator. In the third quarter of 2024, Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) reported revenue of $32.07 billion, which grew by 7% from the same period last year. The company's performance highlighted its strength, with broadband ARPU rising by 3.6%. Its connectivity business also grew by 5%. Adjusted EBITDA margins for Connectivity & Platforms reached 40.9%. Additionally, the company successfully delivered the Paris Summer Olympics, driving double-digit growth in Peacock revenue and paid subscribers, while also securing NBC's position as the top network for the 2023-2024 season. From a dividend point of view, Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) held a steady cash position. In the most recent quarter, the company generated over $7 billion in operating cash flow and its free cash flow came in at more than $3.4 billion. In addition, it returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through dividends, which makes CMCSA one of the best dividend stocks on our list. Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.31 per share and has a dividend yield of 3.20%, as of December 10. The company has been rewarding shareholders with growing dividends for the past 16 years. The number of hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owning stakes in Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) jumped to 72 in Q3 2024, from 61 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a collective value of more than $5.44 billion. With over 31.8 million shares, First Eagle Investment Management was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3. Overall CMCSA ranks 8th on our list of the best American dividend stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential for CMCSA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CMCSA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 11 Best Cosmetic Surgery and Aesthetics Stocks to Invest in Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stands against the other cosmetic surgery and aesthetics stocks. In the face of economic uncertainty, consumer preferences in the beauty industry are changing. A Bloomberg Intelligence poll conducted in June 2024 with 650 participants found that 40% of respondents gave beauty and personal care purchases more importance than other products. Nonetheless, this represents the lowest result since the survey's launch two years ago, a 10-percentage-point drop from January. Despite the continued success of premium cosmetic products, there is less demand for mainstream, reasonably priced products, which make up the majority of the market. Leonard Lauder's "Lipstick Index" theory, which associates economic slowdowns with increased spending on self-care, seems less sound these days. Although the beauty industry has grown significantly over the last five years, Andrea Felsted, a Bloomberg Opinion columnist, observes that customer interests are beginning to shift. This drop in affordable beauty purchases raises questions about how well the industry can withstand economic downturns. The results point to changing customer behavior, with high-end products performing better and less expensive markets being squeezed during difficult economic conditions. Amidst this shift, according to Ulta CEO Dave Kimbell, younger generations, Gen Z and Gen Alpha, are more willing to spend money on beauty than previous generations, especially on skincare or as a way to express themselves. He also mentioned that a growing percentage of Americans are Hispanic consumers, who are more likely to be active in the area. Here are some comments from Kimbell: “While we anticipate that some of these headwinds will persist in the near term, we are confident in our ability to deliver on our plans and set ourselves up for long-term growth.” Meanwhile, the market for medical aesthetics, or procedures meant to enhance patients' physical attractiveness, is expected to grow in the future. According to research by senior partner Olivier Leclerc and colleagues, the CAGR for neuromodulators like Botox is anticipated to reach 11.9 percent in the US and Canada by 2025. By 2025, the compound annual growth rate for injectable dermal fillers, such as biostimulators and hyaluronic acid fillers, may reach 3.8 percent. Moreover, as per McKinsey's research report, through 2025, the medical aesthetics industry is expected to continue growing at a rate close to double digits. In one of the recent developments, finance solutions like "buy-now, pay-later" loans are being given to make cosmetic procedures more affordable because of the rising demand for these procedures in the United States, as reported by Bloomberg. While the demand spike from the pandemic has subsided, rates of aesthetic procedures are still substantially higher than they were before COVID, with a 2023 increase over 2024, according to a June 2024 study from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. Financing programs that divide expenses ranging from $200 to $10,000 into smaller installments over three to sixty months are now advantageous for facial procedures and other treatments. These choices are especially appealing to younger consumers because they frequently include interest-free terms and low credit requirements. According to Bloomberg, sales of asset-backed securities in the United States have increased by almost 20% year over year, reflecting this trend in the larger financial market. This highlights the connection between high customer demand and innovative financial solutions. In this article, we first used a stock screener, to list down all Cosmetic Surgery and Aesthetics Stocks (as of the writing of this article) with the highest institutional ownership. From the resultant dataset, we chose 11 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors, using Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds in Q3 2024 to gauge hedge fund sentiment for stocks.

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 81 The multinational healthcare firm Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), through its subsidiary MENTOR, specializes in breast reconstruction and aesthetics. For use in cosmetic and reconstructive breast surgery treatments, the company offers breast implants, tissue expanders, and other surgical materials. Mentor's Breast Implant Simulator app allows users to submit images or use real-time video to model implant sizes. It uses augmented reality to display breast augmentation outcomes. It also provides educational content, connects users to nearby surgeons, and makes it easier to share discoveries for feedback. Revenue increased by 5.25% YoY to $22.47 billion in the third quarter of 2024, with Innovative Medicine leading the way with a 4.9% YoY growth to $14.58 billion. Moreover, the MedTech division, which encompasses aesthetics, reported a 6.4% increase in operational sales in the third quarter of 2024. Acquisitions such as Abiomed had a favorable effect on this division. The firm produced $14 billion in free cash flow in the first nine months of this year, compared to $11.9 billion in the same period last year. For the past 62 years, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has consistently increased its dividends. The current quarterly dividend paid by the firm is $1.62 per share. An analyst at Wolfe Research named Alexandria Hammond began covering Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) with a $190 price target and an Outperform rating. Beyond Mounjaro/Zepbound from Lilly (LLY), the firm anticipates growth names and/or "dream the dream" names to win in 2025. J&J's Pharma growth drivers, including JNJ-2113, Tremfya, nipocalimab, Carvykti, and Drazalex Faspro, are viewed as "best-in-class" by the firm. Moreover, Wolfe predicts that J&J's revenue would increase by at least 3% despite Stelara's loss of exclusivity challenges. Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management was the largest stakeholder in the company from among the funds in Insider Monkey's database. It owns 7,560,199 shares worth $1.23 billion as of Q3. Overall JNJ ranks 1st on our list of the best cosmetic surgery and aesthetics stocks to invest in now.

Title: Bitcoin LTHs cash out at 326% gains: Can new demand keep BTC stable?

Time Published: 2024-12-11T04:00:34Z

Long-term Bitcoin holders are cashing out amid a rally, while new investors help absorb supply. As Bitcoin’s [BTC] price continues its impressive rally, long-term holders are seizing the opportunity to cash out, realizing gains of approximately 326% on their investments with an average entry price of $23.4K. This surge in profit-taking has added selling pressure to the market, yet BTC has demonstrated remarkable resilience, absorbing the increased supply. But what’s driving these LTHs to sell now? And how are new investors stepping in to sustain the market’s upward momentum? Long-term BTC holders are capitalizing on the current rally, realizing an average 326% profit with an entry cost of $23.4K. This behavior aligns with historical patterns where significant price surges often trigger profit-taking. However, this wave of selling appears more strategic than reactive. With BTC trading well above the LTH cost basis, many are opting to de-risk amidst macroeconomic uncertainties, including potential interest rate shifts and market liquidity concerns. Source: X Additionally, the cyclical nature of Bitcoin’s halving events may play a role, with some LTHs anticipating a plateau or temporary downturn. Despite this selling pressure, Bitcoin’s resilience – buoyed by strong demand from newer market entrants – shows a robust redistribution phase rather than an alarming sell-off. This shift in market dynamics could redefine BTC’s near-term trajectory. The recent surge in BTC’s price reflects a shift where demand, rather than just supply constraints, is driving its growth. New investors, particularly those leveraging institutional-grade financial instruments like Bitcoin ETFs, have played a pivotal role in absorbing the available supply. For instance, the iShares Bitcoin Trust by BlackRock amassed $10 billion in assets under management within seven weeks, accounting for over 40% of spot ETF volumes. This rapid adoption has spurred projections that Bitcoin ETFs might surpass gold ETFs in total assets in the near future. With ETFs now channeling 75% of new Bitcoin investments, their influence could grow even further, especially as the halving event heightened scarcity. Anticipation of reduced supply coupled with increasing demand positions new investors as key drivers of Bitcoin’s price momentum​. As Bitcoin navigates heightened selling pressure from long-term holders, the road ahead appears shaped by crucial developments. The halving event has tightened BTC supply, boosting scarcity premiums. Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024–2025 Institutional interest, especially through spot Bitcoin ETFs, may stabilize demand and promote adoption. However, regulatory clarity remains crucial for BTC’s mainstream recognition. Bitcoin’s growing link to macroeconomic trends and traditional assets positions it as both speculative and maturing. Its ability to sustain growth or navigate volatility depends on balancing innovation, adoption, and the ongoing tension between scarcity and liquidity.

Vishal Mega Mart is a one-stop destination catering to middle and lower-middle-income consumers in India. The product range includes both in-house and third-party brands, covering three key categories -- apparel, general merchandise, and fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG). Report by KS Badri Narayanan of businessline | Read here Leader with strong moats in a growing industry - Emkay Global Research Vishal Mega Mart (VMML) caters to a large and fast-growing TAM (USD430bn; ~10% CAGR), by affordably addressing aspirations of the middle-/lower-income India. Variety and Affordability are key moats, as VMML is a one-stop-shop for Apparel/FMCG/General Merchandise categories, and offers the best affordability with high share of own brands (~72%). VMML aspires to continue delivering strong double-digit growth, mainly helped by low-teen SSG trends and partly via store additions. VMML expects to see retail space CAGR of ~10%, as it currently caters to ~400 cities vs a huge potential of ~1,300 cities (with population above 50K). VMML also has potential to go deeper in existing cities. High store-throughput and lower WC needs ensure best-in-class payback (18-20 months) and generate sufficient cash-flows for pursuing growth. IPO of Rs80bn is entirely OFS, with post-IPO market cap of Rs352bn. Key risks: Supply overhang on big PE ownership and potential ESOP dilution (4-5%). Vishal Mega Mart is all set to launch its ₹8,000 crore IPO today for public at a price band of ₹74-78. The IPO will close on December 13 and the market lot is 190 shares. The proposed IPO is entirely an Offer For Sale (OFS) of shares by promoter Samayat Services LLP, with no fresh issue of equity shares.

Title: Is AppLovin Corporation (APP) Among the Best Aggressive Growth Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds?
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/applovin-corporation-app-among-best-024932001.html
Time Published: 2024-12-11T02:49:32Z

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Aggressive Growth Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP) stands against the other aggressive growth stocks. For a large portion of investors who put money in the market, growth is the primary objective. The stocks that these investors prefer are also stocks that are either currently exhibiting strong revenue growth or have product strengths or other competitive advantages that can ensure that they will dominate their markets and grow in the future. Broadly speaking, it is possible to identify such stocks by looking at which industries are expected to grow strongly. A few years ago, semiconductor design and fabrication was one such sector. Back then, the world's largest integrated chip manufacturer known for its Core processor lineup had started to struggle. The nature of the semiconductor industry which requires years of research expertise and billions of dollars in capital expenditure meant that the market was not only open to new players but also that this opening favored incumbents that already had the necessary investments and expertise in place. This gap led to the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of the firm which ranked 3rd on our list of 10 AI Stocks That Will Skyrocket to touch astronomically high levels as soon as the firm started to turn a profit. As an illustration, consider the P/E ratio of this stock at Q1 2018's close. The ratio back then was 111, while the integrated chip manufacturer was trading at 19 and the Taiwanese contract chip manufacturer which ranks 2nd on our list of 10 Best Tech Stocks For Long-Term Investment traded at 16.11. During the same period, Wall Street's favorite AI GPU stock whose shares have gained 700%+ since OpenAI publicly released ChatGPT was trading at a P/E ratio of 37. Naturally, this indicated that investors were betting heavily on the firm to grow. Since 2018's first quarter, its shares have gained a whopping 1,204% while the GPU company has gained 2,175% and the integrated chip manufacturer is down by 57.6%. Between its fiscal years 2017 to the latest trailing-twelve-month revenue, the growth stock that traded at a P/E ratio of 111 in 2018 has grown revenue by 358%, so it's safe to say that in this case, growth investors were right, and their investments if dearly held since then have outpaced the firm's revenue in growth terms. Therein lies the magic of growth stocks, which can generate substantial returns for investors. However, as is the case with all things in life, this promise also comes with a dark side. Research from the University of Michigan shows that growth stocks are punished harder than value stocks in case of negative earnings surprises. For their research, the researchers analyzed consensus earnings forecasts, quarterly share prices, stock prices, P/E ratios, and other variables for 13 years to determine the returns of growth and value stocks that missed or beat analyst earnings estimates. By bifurcating their results across five categories starting from Low Growth and ending at High Growth, they demonstrate a clear difference between the post-earnings stock returns of growth and non-growth stocks. For the Low Growth stocks, a negative earnings surprise led to -3.57% in share price returns starting two days following the report and ending before the next report. The High Growth stocks led the Low Growth stocks by 3.75 percentage points in negative returns as they lost 7.32% over the same period after posting a negative earnings surprise. The 3.75 percentage point differential is key when we analyze these two categories' stock price performance after positive earnings surprises. This is because while the Low Growth stocks gained 5.44% after the earnings surprise, the High Growth stocks led them by only 0.88 percentage points by gaining 6.32%. Similarly, not only are growth stocks punished harder if they miss investor expectations, but the share price drops can make earlier optimism regarding their fortunes appear misplaced as well. The best example of this fact is the software-as-a-service (SaaS) industry. SaaS firms were the pinnacle of growth investing because of their business model which allows them to earn recurring revenue through sizable contracts while keeping costs low. Investor optimism surrounding SaaS stock touched a feverish pitch in Q1 2021 when their median EV/Revenue multiple sat at 14.1x. This meant that the firms' market capitalization and debt minus cash and other assets were valued 14 times their sales. But, by Q4 2022 this had dropped to 4.6x as a combination of factors such as higher rates leading to tighter business spending and the pivot towards artificial intelligence soured sentiment. SaaS firms were particularly hurt since AI enables businesses to self-develop software which reduces the need for SaaS products and services. So, with the landscape surrounding growth stocks being as dynamic as their share prices, we decided to look at some aggressive growth stocks with high revenue growth and significant hedge fund interest. Our Methodology To compile our list of the best aggressive growth stocks, we first sifted out 12 stocks with annual latest quarter revenue growth greater than 35% from multiple growth ETFs. The stocks were then ranked by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares during Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a mobile device, showing an advertiser reaching out to a consumer via a software-based platform. Revenue Growth: 38.6% Number of Hedge Fund Investors In Q3 2024: 51 AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP) is a software company that works with video game companies to enable them to run advertisements, analytics, and other associated operations. It is one of the best-performing stocks of 2024 as the shares are up an unbelievable 935% year-to-date. AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP) is also a diversified company as it owns and runs more than 200 video games in a market where the internet and digital entertainment mediums reign supreme. The firm benefited from a blowout third-quarter earnings report in November which sent its shares surging by a stunning 33% in aftermarket trading. AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP)'s $1.2 billion in revenue marked a 38.6% annual growth and beat analyst estimates of $1.12 billion. Its median guidance of $1.25 billion for fourth-quarter revenue also beat analyst estimates of $1.17 billion by a comfortable $800 million. Looking ahead, AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP) could benefit from expanding into tertiary markets such as connected televisions to add more juice to its stock. SaltLight Capital mentioned AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP) in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: “This quarter, our notable contributors included AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP). We start with the current state of the “hit” title-driven market. These dynamics are not new, so many studios have transitioned to free-to-play games (FTP). We then talk about AppLovin, which is at the nexus of making this traditional market successful. Overall APP ranks 4th on our list of the aggressive growth stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of APP as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than APP but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Jim Cramer Says He Likes Adobe Inc. (ADBE) ‘Very Much’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Jim Cramer Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) stands against the other Jim Cramer stocks. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently discussed the rise of Bitcoin and expressed his admiration for the digital currency’s growth. However, he was careful to emphasize that Bitcoin should not replace traditional investments, particularly stocks, but rather should complement them in a diversified portfolio. “I want to discuss Bitcoin, really I do, not to the detriment of stocks but in addition to stocks. I come to praise Bitcoin, not bury it.” Cramer recalled the moment when President-elect Donald Trump began giving importance to cryptocurrency during his administration. On July 27, Trump declared that the U.S. government would fully embrace Bitcoin if he won the election. At the time, Bitcoin was valued just under $70,000. Cramer also noted Trump’s promise to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve and make America the global leader in cryptocurrency. Cramer highlighted Trump’s statement, “If crypto is going to define the future, I want it to be mined, minted, and made in the USA.” Regardless of whether one agrees with the policy, Cramer remarked, Trump’s words were a clear signal of how beneficial the growing popularity of cryptocurrency could be for its owners. READ ALSO Jim Cramer’s Lightning Rounds: 12 Stocks Under the Spotlight and Jim Cramer’s Game Plan This Week: 10 Stocks to Watch Cramer then shared insights from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who suggested that many investors see Bitcoin as a store of value, similar to gold. He went on to say: “I've always endorsed keeping up to 10% of your portfolio in gold as a kind of insurance against the world's lunacy. But for years now, I've also been saying Bitcoin's a fine alternative to gold for that 10% position. Why not? I think the federal budget deficit is at impossible levels. I don't want to be wedded to a currency backed by the full faith and credit of a country that owes $36 trillion.” Cramer also acknowledged that some people might have gone all-in on Bitcoin and praised their decision. However, he recommended balancing Bitcoin investments with stocks. For instance, if Trump were to make a move to encourage buying Tesla, Cramer commented, having both stocks and crypto would give investors an edge. “While we could become the bitcoin network, especially since President-elect Trump christened us as the bitcoin nation, I actually think there’s more to investing than just owning cryptocurrencies… Bitcoin's part of the most obviously diversified portfolio in recent history. Buying and holding stocks can be just as lucrative as buying Bitcoin six days after Biden dropped out of the race. Or maybe, just maybe, it can make you even more money.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 29 stocks that Cramer was bullish on during episodes of Mad Money aired over the last 2 weeks. We narrowed the list to 10 stocks that were most favored by analysts. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their average analyst price target upside as of December 9. The average price target upside was calculated while the market was open. We also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s Q3 database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A team of engineers and scientists collaborating at a workstation surrounded by their applications and solutions. Average Price Target Upside: 13.86% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 123 Cramer commented on Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) before it reports its Q4 and FY2024 earnings on December 11, saying: “As I mentioned earlier, the enterprise software stocks have been roaring, reacting very positively to pretty much everything these days. So maybe we should start thinking about buying the stock of Adobe, which has some of the very best software to help businesses with marketing and web design. I like this company very much, but it's been stuck in enterprise software purgatory. Not anymore. Maybe it has a real run by just delivering good numbers.” Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a prominent software company known for offering a wide range of products and services, particularly in digital media creation and document management. Recently, the company has made significant strides in integrating AI into its products. During its third-quarter earnings call, management highlighted how the integration of AI, particularly in generative features, into its core products has led to higher customer retention, as users tend to stick with the tools that incorporate these advanced capabilities. The company projects its total revenue for the fourth quarter to fall between $5.50 billion and $5.55 billion. It expects non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $4.63 to $4.68. Furthermore, Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) expects to see a net new annual recurring revenue (ARR) of approximately $550 million from its Digital Media segment. This segment's revenue is forecasted to be between $4.09 billion and $4.12 billion. In addition, the company expects its Digital Experience segment to generate revenue between $1.36 billion and $1.38 billion, with subscription revenue from this segment ranging from $1.23 billion to $1.25 billion. Overall ADBE ranks 6th on our list of the best Jim Cramer stocks according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of ADBE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ADBE but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Why Marvell Technology (MRVL) Is Winning Big in the AI and Cloud Revolution

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI News That Broke The Internet. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) stands against the other AI stocks. Should original content contributors be paid every time large language models use their work? OpenAI CEO Sam Altman believes they should, much like Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) deals for college athletes, he said on Wednesday at the New York Times’ DealBook Summit. “I think we do need a new [standard] for how creators are going to get rewarded. We need to find new economic models where creators can have new revenue streams”. READ ALSO: 10 Buzzing AI Stocks Making Headlines and Top 10 AI News Stories For The Weekend Even though developing such an economic model will be complex, it is unclear how people getting paid for their original work could become a norm in the future even if it does. The news comes amidst ChatGPT, Altman’s AI chatbot, which has itself been under fire numerous times over the years over copyright infringement and unpermitted use of published articles. “A particular passion of mine has always been, can we figure out how to do micropayments where, if you generate a story in the style of [a writer, they] can opt into that ... and get paid for it.” Regardless of Altman’s company facing criticism over copyright infringement concerns and ethical debates surrounding its AI models, the company continues to push boundaries in AI innovation, introducing groundbreaking tools and features that redefine the tech landscape. In its latest, OpenAI has introduced its buzzy AI video-generation tool, Sora, on Monday, December 9th. Working similar to OpenAI’s image-generation AI tool, DALL-E, Sora will be able to develop a high-definition video clip each time a user types out a desired scene. The video generation tool will also be able to generate video clips inspired by still images and extend existing videos or fill in missing frames. As per OpenAI’s YouTube live stream, the tool will debut to U.S. users as well as to “most countries internationally” on Monday, December 9th. However, it also said that there is “no timeline” yet for launching the tool in Europe and the U.K., as well as some other countries. In October, the company closed its latest funding round with a valuation of $157 billion, securing $6.6 billion from a wide range of investment firms and major tech companies. All of the company’s strategic initiatives and funding are part of a thoughtful growth plan for OpenAI as the company competes with other strong AI startups such as Anthropic, Elon Musk’s xAI, and other tech giants. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). An assembly line in a semiconductor factory, with workers at their stations. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 70 Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) is a semiconductor firm with a significant focus on data centers. The company was awarded a “Buy” rating on December 4 by DBS analyst Fang Boon Foo, having reiterated its bullish stance on the stock. Marvell Technology has been thriving in the data center market, with revenues surpassing expectations that are driven by a strong demand for its AI technologies. The company makes custom AI chips for Alphabet's Google, Amazon and Microsoft. The company’s leadership in communications and connectivity, reinforced by key growth areas such as data infrastructure, cloud, and 5G, underpins its market advantage. Moreover, its shift from consumer products achieved through strategic acquisitions like Innovium, Inphi, and Aquantia, demonstrates its commitment towards stable enterprise solutions. Lastly, expected growth in return on equity and a recovery in non-AI segments support a positive outlook despite past challenges. Overall, MRVL ranks 5th on our list of AI news that broke the internet. While we acknowledge the potential of MRVL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MRVL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

By Lewis (JO:LEWJ) Krauskopf and Carmel Crimmins NEW YORK (Reuters) -BlackRock Inc, the world's largest asset manager, is looking for opportunities to expand its technology capabilities including in the area of artificial intelligence, its chief operating officer said on Tuesday.

Goldstein pointed to particular opportunities in AI. "In this world of artificial intelligence, I think there's a lot more you can do with regard to not only data, but importantly automating a lot of processes," Goldstein said. BlackRock, which manages $11.5 trillion in assets, which struck nearly $30 billion in acquisitions this year.

Title: BlackRock sees investor shift from cash after even 'modest' rate cuts

Time Published: 2024-12-10T23:28:56Z

By Davide Barbuscia NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are expected to increase their allocations to stocks and bonds from cash after even "modest" Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s chief financial officer said on Tuesday. Expectations earlier this year that the U.S. central bank would cut interest rates aggressively after hiking them to fight inflation have moderated in recent months as the U.S. economy continues to show momentum despite high borrowing costs. "I think even modest rate cuts are going to fuel a very healthy amount of investor re-risking," said BlackRock CFO Martin Small, speaking at the Goldman Sachs U.S. Financial Services conference on Tuesday. Lower interest rates are expected to eventually pull yields in money markets down from well above 4%, which is where cash-like instruments like T-bills currently stand. So far, however, there has been little evidence that investors are abandoning cash. Assets in U.S. money markets stood at $6.77 trillion as of last week, data from the Investment Company Institute showed, up from $6.3 trillion in early September. "There's still enough political and economic uncertainty in the world that cash is an attractive safe haven for clients," Small said. "Market expectations for rate cuts ... are shallower and fewer," he said, adding that these and other factors had made money market fund balances stickier. The U.S. central bank started cutting interest rates in September by 50 basis points. That was followed by another 25 basis point cut last month, with investors now betting on an additional quarter of a percentage point cut later this month. After that, further easing is largely expected to depend on economic data as well as the path of inflation. Investors now expect interest rates of about 3.7% by the end of next year, which would be about 90 basis points higher than what was priced in September. Still, Small said investors that favor cash were underperforming traditional investment portfolios that blended equities and bonds. "That fear of missing out ... is contributing meaningfully to re-risking," he said. BlackRock's fixed-income products such as bond exchange-traded funds had seen strong inflows this year, he added. "It's not the floodgates ... but we've definitely seen more normalized allocations legging into fixed income," he said.

He Lifeng is one of China's four vice premiers, and heads the ruling Chinese Communist Party's economic and finance committee. He met with BlackRock Chairman and CEO Larry Fink in Beijing on Dec. 5, and Goldman Sachs President and COO John E. Waldron on Dec. 4, according to state media. That followed a meeting with Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser on Nov. 21, state media said. "The Chinese are seeking all possible avenues to access those now ascending to power in Washington. The Trump Team," said Peter Alexander, founder of Shanghai-based consulting firm Z-Ben Advisors. "Back channeling is how China operates, even prefers, when building lines of communications." Goldman Sachs said it was aware of the reports. The two other financial firms did not respond to a CNBC request for comment. Trump has filled his Cabinet picks with at least 10 reported billionaires, including two with a finance-heavy background: hedge fund manager Scott Bessent for Treasury secretary and Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick for Commerce secretary. "I do think the Wall Street folks that are coming into commerce and treasury will serve a moderating role on the trade protectionist side," said Clark Packard, research fellow at the Cato Institute. "It's all relative because I do think there's going to be something protectionist on the trade side. Those voices will be the voices that work to mitigate some of that." "Especially at Treasury they're pretty worried about market reaction," Packard said. "The one thing that can truly maybe scare Trump away from a really aggressive [policy] would be the market reaction." U.S. stocks are on track for a relatively rare second straight year of more than 20% gains. After tumbling early this year, Chinese stocks rebounded after Beijing signaled a shift toward stimulus in late September. Chinese authorities on Monday affirmed that supportive stance in a high-level meeting. With actions such as hosting Wall Street executives and imposing export controls on critical minerals, Beijing is keeping its options open, said Zongyuan Zoe Liu, who is Maurice R. Greenberg senior fellow for China studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. "They are preparing for the worst-case scenario." But she cautioned that it's unlikely that financial institutions can do much to mitigate tariffs and tensions with the U.S. "Business transactions and Wall Street executives, one way or another, they would not give up opportunities in any market as long as it fits into their profile," Liu said. Chinese financial media summarized He Lifeng's meetings with the U.S. executives as sending a signal on Beijing's willingness to open up the financial sector and attract long-term, foreign institutional investment. Foreign capital inflows are often cast by Chinese state media as a symbol of support for the domestic market. The Chinese vice premier also met with Invesco President and CEO Andrew Schlossberg in Beijing on Nov. 12, and HSBC Group Chairman Mark Tucker on Nov. 14, according to state media. HSBC said it had nothing to add to the report. Invesco did not respond to a request for comment. U.S.-China capital markets have been "arguably the most dynamic and inter-connected aspect" of the bilateral relationship in the last two decades, said Winston Ma, adjunct professor at NYU School of Law. "When the cross-border finance relationship is constructive and cooperative, it could lead to MAP, i.e. mutual assured [prosperity]; otherwise it will be MAD, mutual assured destruction," Ma said, referring to a Cold War deterrence principle.

Title: Why Nvidia (NVDA) Stock Is Declining Again Today

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) shares continued to slide on Tuesday, falling more than 3% after a Chinese regulator announced that it was investigating the chipmaker for possible violations of the country’s antimonopoly law. On Monday, December 9, the Chinese government announced that The State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) had initiated an investigation concerning Nvidia’s acquisition of Mellanox and some agreements made during the acquisition. Nvidia’s acquisition of Mellanox Technologies in 2020 required approval from Chinese antitrust regulators given their substantial operations in China. The country’s competition authority approved the $7 billion acquisition on the condition that competitors be informed of any new Mellanox products within 90 days of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) gaining access to them. The current investigation aims to highlight whether Nvidia complied with this requirement or failed to do so. South China Morning Post reveals that (AI) chip giant Nvidia could face a fine of up to US$1 billion under Beijing’s antitrust probe. The move, considered retaliation against Washington’s chip restrictions, marks the first time that China’s market regulator has opened the books on a closed deal. As per China’s antitrust law, companies violating antitrust regulations could face fines ranging from 1 to 10 percent of their annual sales from the previous year. However, it does not specify whether this applies to global or China sales. China, including Hong Kong, is Nvidia’s third-largest market by revenue, with sales reaching US$10.3 billion for the financial year ended January 24 (nearly 17 percent of its total revenue). However, it is too early to determine the exact amount of the fine Nvidia could be facing. “Nvidia wins on merit, as reflected in our benchmark results and value to customers, and customers can choose whatever solution is best for them. We work hard to provide the best products we can in every region and honour our commitments everywhere we do business. We are happy to answer any questions regulators may have about our business.”- Nvidia said in a statement issued in response to the probe. The leading AI chipmaker slid despite a key sales boost from supplier TSMC. While TSMC's strong sales highlight robust demand for Nvidia's GPUs and AI chips, investor sentiment was likely overshadowed by the ongoing antitrust probe. Nvidia’s continued slide today may also have been due to traders opting to sell an “earlier pop”. Historically, December hasn’t been kind to Nvidia either. According to Benzinga, the semiconductor giant often comes into a temporary bearish phase following its third-quarter earnings report. Nvidia's performance through November is typically strong, creating a favorable environment for year-end profit-taking. This move to secure profits before year-end creates a downward pressure. Nevertheless, December declines like these are likely to be temporary, with the stock likely to rebound in the first quarter, as it has done so previously. Our research director shared his views on NVDA’s earnings results here. He thinks NVDA stock can reach $170 within 3 months. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

However, he was careful to emphasize that Bitcoin should not replace traditional investments, particularly stocks, but rather should complement them in a diversified portfolio. “I want to discuss Bitcoin, really I do, not to the detriment of stocks but in addition to stocks. I come to praise Bitcoin, not bury it.” Cramer recalled the moment when President-elect Donald Trump began giving importance to cryptocurrency during his administration. On July 27, Trump declared that the U.S. government would fully embrace Bitcoin if he won the election. At the time, Bitcoin was valued just under $70,000. Cramer also noted Trump’s promise to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve and make America the global leader in cryptocurrency. Cramer highlighted Trump’s statement, “If crypto is going to define the future, I want it to be mined, minted, and made in the USA.” Regardless of whether one agrees with the policy, Cramer remarked, Trump’s words were a clear signal of how beneficial the growing popularity of cryptocurrency could be for its owners. READ ALSO Jim Cramer’s Lightning Rounds: 12 Stocks Under the Spotlight and Jim Cramer’s Game Plan This Week: 10 Stocks to Watch Cramer then shared insights from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who suggested that many investors see Bitcoin as a store of value, similar to gold. He went on to say: “I've always endorsed keeping up to 10% of your portfolio in gold as a kind of insurance against the world's lunacy. But for years now, I've also been saying Bitcoin's a fine alternative to gold for that 10% position. Why not? I think the federal budget deficit is at impossible levels. I don't want to be wedded to a currency backed by the full faith and credit of a country that owes $36 trillion.” Cramer also acknowledged that some people might have gone all-in on Bitcoin and praised their decision. However, he recommended balancing Bitcoin investments with stocks. For instance, if Trump were to make a move to encourage buying Tesla, Cramer commented, having both stocks and crypto would give investors an edge. “While we could become the bitcoin network, especially since President-elect Trump christened us as the bitcoin nation, I actually think there’s more to investing than just owning cryptocurrencies… Bitcoin's part of the most obviously diversified portfolio in recent history. Buying and holding stocks can be just as lucrative as buying Bitcoin six days after Biden dropped out of the race. Or maybe, just maybe, it can make you even more money.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 29 stocks that Cramer was bullish on during episodes of Mad Money aired over the last 2 weeks. We narrowed the list to 10 stocks that were most favored by analysts. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their average analyst price target upside as of December 9. The average price target upside was calculated while the market was open. We also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s Q3 database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). An oil rig pumping under the open sky of the Permian Basin. Average Price Target Upside: 31.26% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39 Cramer called Coterra Energy Inc. (NYSE:CTRA) the “shrewdest operators in the industry” and said: “I still very much like Coterra Energy, currently the only energy holding in my Charitable Trust… This is another exploration production play, although it’s more balanced between oil and gas. In fact, after a pair of acquisitions announced earlier this month, Coterra’s revenue mix will tip a bit more in favor of oil. Next year, we like to say it’s more oily, less gassy. It does happen to have the lowest cost natural gas of any company in our country and that’s because of the legacy of the old Cabot Oil & Gas which created Coterra when it merged with Cimarex and rebranded the combined company. Coterra (NYSE:CTRA) is an independent oil and gas company involved in the exploration, development, and production of oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids. On December 5, JPMorgan analyst Arun Jayaram raised the stock's price target to $31 from $29 and maintained an Overweight rating on the stock. The firm anticipates that natural gas producers will benefit from "three key secular demand trends" in 2025: the expansion of liquefied natural gas export capacity, growing power demand due to electrification, and the shift from coal to gas. JPMorgan also updated its exploration and production models through 2030, supporting its view of long-term gas prices remaining above $3.50 per MMBtu. The firm believes prices must rise to encourage additional supply growth from the Haynesville and other higher-cost gas basins. Furthermore, JPMorgan expects the oil market to transition from balanced in 2024 to a surplus in 2025 due to increased supply, prompting a shift to a "more defensive stance." In Q3, Coterra (NYSE:CTRA) secured three long-term natural gas sales agreements, starting in 2027-2028, boosting its strategy with exposure to international LNG markets. In November, the company also announced $3.95 billion in acquisitions from Franklin Mountain Energy and Avant Natural Resources, expanding its presence in New Mexico and the Permian Basin. These acquisitions are expected to add 60,000 to 70,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2025, with the deals closing in Q1 2025. Overall CTRA ranks 1st on our list of the best Jim Cramer stocks according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of CTRA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

The Texas Stock Exchange is getting ready to plant its flag in the Dallas real estate market. The upstart bourse backed by investors including BlackRock Inc. and Citadel Securities will open a temporary headquarters this spring at the Weir’s Plaza building, just north of downtown Dallas. The search is on for a permanent home, to be called the Texas Market Center, the company said in an emailed statement. Once built, the headquarters will house executive offices, a conference center and a television studio complete with an opening bell as the the TXSE seeks to take on established markets such as the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. A museum meant to showcase the history of modern business in Texas will also sit in the market center. The Dallas-Fort Worth area now has more finance workers than Chicago or Los Angeles, trailing only New York, as companies from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to Charles Schwab Corp. expand operations. The TXSE is aiming to build on the state’s reputation for low taxes and a lighter regulatory touch, saying that companies that list on the market won’t need to meet environmental, social and governance thresholds beyond standard regulatory requirements. “The Texas Market Center will add to the vibrancy of Dallas’ thriving business community, and we believe it will drive further investment and corporate interest in the city and surrounding region,” James Lee, chief executive officer and founder of TXSE Group Inc., said in the statement. Texas has also increasingly lured corporations and financial firms from blue states such as New York and California. Texas is also developing a business-court system with an eye to handling more of the complex corporate litigation that Delaware is known for. The TXSE said earlier this year that it expects to handle its first trades in 2025 and host its first listing in 2026. The Texas venture is trying to muscle in on a business that consists of about 16 equities exchanges with widely varying trading volumes. Elsewhere in Dallas, the exchange plans to operate a data center to go with facilities in New Jersey and Chicago. Earlier this year, it hired executives from Charles Schwab, Nasdaq and the NYSE.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Jim Cramer’s Lightning Rounds: 12 Stocks Under the Spotlight. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Omeros Corporation (NASDAQ:OMER) stands against other stocks under Jim Cramer's lightning rounds' spotlight. Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, recently discussed the outlook for the stock market following a year of strong gains, cautioning that investors’ overly optimistic expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts could lead to trouble. As the year draws to a close, brokerages are releasing their official market predictions for 2025, and so far, they are almost universally positive. He said that this optimism is understandable given the strong earnings season and the significant stock market rally following the election. Cramer noted that many investors are betting that a business-friendly administration will continue to drive better returns. “See, after all these gains, you gotta get a little squeamish, don’t you? Unless something drastic happens in the next few weeks, we’re in line for our second straight year of 20% plus returns for the S&P 500. First time that’s happened since 1999, ooh, not the best precedent. Plus, the market’s gotten really expensive by historical standards.” READ ALSO: Jim Cramer Discussed 10 Stocks That Can Do Well in December and Jim Cramer’s Lightning Round: 7 Stocks to Watch Cramer said that his main worry is that Wall Street may have gotten ahead of itself, with too many investors expecting more rate cuts from the Federal Reserve than are realistically likely. He highlighted the unusual situation that has unfolded since the Fed’s surprise double rate cut in September. While short-term interest rates have come down, long-term rates set by the bond market have actually risen, creating a stark contrast. He remarked: “The market’s betting on a December rate cut. Anything that derails that will be bad news for the averages.” When looking ahead to 2025, Cramer noted a significant lack of consensus about future rate cuts. He pointed to Fed funds futures for December 2025, which show a wide range of predicted outcomes. Investors are betting on anywhere from zero to eight rate cuts by then, with the most likely scenario being three cuts by the end of 2025. Cramer explained that while he thinks three rate cuts sound reasonable, it also suggests that roughly 41% of the market is anticipating too many cuts over the next year, a scenario that could disappoint many money managers. “So here’s the bottom line: Given all the success we’ve had in this market, we need to guard against complacency and that’s why I’m flagging my biggest worry that the market might be getting too aggressive with its expectations for rate cuts over the next year.” For this article, we compiled a list of 12 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during recent episodes of Mad Money. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds.

A scientist working in a modern lab, examining small-molecule and protein therapeutics. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 8 During the lightning round, when a viewer asked Cramer about Omeros Corporation (NASDAQ:OMER), he said that it is possibly time to take some profit. “Well, it finally seems to have its day, but this weekend, there’s some big presentations at the thing called ASH… They’re going to make presentations, a lot of other companies, and it better be good after that run and I can’t be assured that it is good. Maybe it’s a little profit-taking time.” Omeros (NASDAQ:OMER) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing therapeutics for immunologic diseases, cancers, and addictive disorders, with key products in trials for various conditions. It should be noted that over the first nine months of 2024, the company’s net loss amounted to $125.5 million, or $2.15 per share, which is a deeper loss compared to the net loss of $108.8 million, or $1.73 per share, for the same period in the previous year. As of September 30, 2024, the company had $123.2 million in cash and short-term investments, marking a decrease of $48.7 million from the end of 2023. These funds are being used for ongoing operations and debt obligations. The company recently reported some good news as it made a significant announcement regarding its investigational drug zaltenibart (OMS906. It has received a rare pediatric disease designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This designation is for the drug’s potential use in treating complement 3 glomerulopathy (C3G), a rare and serious kidney disorder that primarily affects children and young adults. Additionally, Omeros’ (NASDAQ:OMER) zaltenibart is being developed for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), another rare disease, for which it has already received orphan drug designation from the FDA. The market for PNH treatments is anticipated to grow substantially, from $3.9 billion in 2023 to $10.1 billion by 2032, reflecting the increasing demand for effective therapies for these complex conditions. Overall, OMER ranks 11th on our list of stocks under Jim Cramer's lightning rounds' spotlight. While we acknowledge the potential of OMER as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

(NASDAQ:STRL), Cramer said: “This stock’s up 120%. Now I will tell you, Sterling infrastructure… It is living off, I think, a lot of the federal money that’s been spent. So, I don’t want to get greedy… Take some off the table and let the rest run.” Sterling Infrastructure (NASDAQ:STRL) provides a range of services, including site development for e-commerce, data centers, and power generation, infrastructure projects for transportation systems, and concrete foundations and plumbing services for residential and commercial buildings. It works with federal, state, and municipal governments, particularly state Departments of Transportation (DOTs) and other regional authorities overseeing airports, ports, water systems, and railroads. Four state DOTs accounted for half of the segment’s revenue in 2023, a slight increase from 44% in 2022 and 42% in 2021. In the third-quarter earnings call, management highlighted that the company is currently in the second half of the federal funding cycle for transportation projects. They mentioned that the company has built up a backlog of over two years and continues to see strong activity in the sector. Management believes that the company is positioned in a market environment that supports sustained growth above historical levels, assuming margins hold steady or improve. In addition to its transportation work, Sterling Infrastructure (NASDAQ:STRL) continues to benefit from the growing demand for hyperscale data center development. Earlier this year, its subsidiary, Plateau Excavation, was awarded a data center project in the southeastern U.S., valued at approximately $100 million. The project includes 280 acres of site work, with 125,000 linear feet of underground infrastructure installation.

Hit your long-term targets. Earn up to 16% per year on digital assets. Share this article Microsoft’s shareholder vote on the Bitcoin investment proposal is approaching, but prediction market traders see only a small chance that it will pass. Polymarket bettors predict that Microsoft shareholders will not approve the Bitcoin investment proposal, estimating only a 11% likelihood of a favorable vote. The odds of approval initially peaked at 22% when the poll was launched, but have since declined. According to an October filing with the SEC, the highly anticipated vote will take place at 8:30 AM PS today, with the results expected to be announced soon after the conclusion of the meeting. Microsoft’s board of directors has recommended that shareholders vote against the proposal, initiated by the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), which advocates Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation. The board stated that the company had already evaluated a wide range of investment options, including Bitcoin, as part of its financial strategy. The outcome of the Microsoft Bitcoin vote will largely depend on the stance of its shareholders, but who are they? Microsoft shareholders include a mix of institutional investors, individual shareholders, and the company’s board members and executives. Approximately 70% of Microsoft shares are held by institutional investors, with Vanguard Group, BlackRock, and State Street taking the major stakes, according to data from Wall Street Zen. While many institutional investors in this group have a supportive stance on Bitcoin, they typically prioritize stability and long-term growth, which may lead them to align with the board’s recommendation against the proposal due to concerns over Bitcoin’s volatility. Retail investors account for about 23.5% of Microsoft’s ownership. This group of investors may have varied opinions. Some may support the proposal, seeing Bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation and a way to enhance shareholder value, while others might share the board’s cautious view. Insiders, including executives and board members, hold over 6% of the company’s shares. However, it’s worth reminding that Microsoft’s board members are skeptical about the proposal. Microsoft is currently focusing more on artificial intelligence (AI) than on crypto. The company has made significant investments in AI and machine learning for 2024, aiming to integrate these technologies across its product ecosystem. The tech giant is committed to advancing natural language processing and computer vision, which are essential for enhancing human-computer interactions. Microsoft has committed a total of approximately $13 billion to OpenAI since their partnership began in 2019. This includes multiple rounds of funding, with a notable investment of $10 billion made in January 2023, which valued OpenAI at around $86 billion at that time. While there are few indicators suggesting that Microsoft will adopt Bitcoin as part of its reserve strategy, there remains a possibility that the company might consider investing a small percentage of its treasury in Bitcoin. This could potentially lead to favorable outcomes for Microsoft’s stock performance, similar to MicroStrategy’s. MicroStrategy’s shares have experienced some recent fluctuations; however, year-to-date, the company’s stock has outperformed most S&P 500 indices with an impressive increase of nearly 500%, according to Yahoo Finance data. Microsoft’s stock has risen approximately 20% over the same period. With Microsoft holding over $78 billion in cash and cash equivalents, allocating just 1% of these holdings to Bitcoin would amount to a $784 million investment, positioning the company as the 10th largest public company holding Bitcoin. In addition to MicroStrategy, several other public companies are also exploring Bitcoin investments. Plus, under the incoming Trump administration, there are expectations for the US to establish a national Bitcoin stockpile. If Microsoft shareholders don’t approve a Bitcoin investment proposal at the forthcoming meeting, their next opportunity to vote will likely occur at the company’s 2025 Annual Shareholders Meeting, typically held in December. Microsoft conducts annual meetings to address various shareholder proposals, and any new proposals regarding Bitcoin or other investments could be introduced at that time.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Buzzing AI Stocks This Week. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other buzzing AI stocks this Week. Paul Hickey, Bespoke Investment Group co-founder, said while talking to CNBC in a latest program that despite the market gains still concentrated in a few names, he’s bullish short and long term because of AI. “The longer term play is the AI trade. This is an AI bull market. Every bull market has a theme, and ChatGPT was to AI what Netscape and AOL were to the internet.” Hickey also mentioned the possible scenario where market gains would start to broaden out. “ChatGPT didn’t invent AI; it made it tangible for consumers and businesses, just like Netscape with the internet. It caused, you know, made it a lot more practical on the part of businesses and the consumer. So I think in that respect, there’s a lot more investment to go, and we’ve seen the infrastructure stocks in AI benefit. But even just last week, some of these software names—and we’re going to slowly start to see that broaden out to the rest of the economy.” READ ALSO Jim Cramer’s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stocks to Watch and Jim Cramer on AMD and Other Stocks For this article, we picked 10 AI stocks currently buzzing on the back of latest news and analyst ratings. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 193 Commenting on Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) results last month, Dan Niles, Niles Investment Management founder and portfolio manager, said that when Nvidia said in its call that the demand would surpass supplies for the next “several quarters,” it set the bar lower for those who “believe the dreams.” “They just reset the bar lower. Things are going to accelerate as you go into next year, and so, depending, you’re in a really great seasonal time of year for stocks. People just want to believe in the Santa Claus rally.” Niles then made his case for the expected slowdown and reality check for Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the future: “You’re going to, at some point next year, run into an issue where you’ll need to see a return on investment for the money you’re putting in. Think about Microsoft—they cut estimates after the June quarter report and again after the September quarter report. At their Ignite conference, they even mentioned hitting a wall, potentially with scaling loss. Simply beating earnings estimates is not enough for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) anymore. The stock fell despite reporting better-than-expected numbers for the latest quarter. However, analysts are sensing a growth slowdown. Nvidia’s Q4 revenue guidance missed the buy-side whisper number of $39 billion, and the company expects gross margins to keep shrinking next quarter. For Q4, non-GAAP gross margin is projected at 73.5%, down from 75% in Q3. NVIDIA Corporation’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) biggest customers, cloud hyperscalers — which account for 50% of its revenue — are increasingly developing in-house AI chips and collaborating with competitors like AMD. This raises concerns about Nvidia’s medium-to-long-term growth in demand and margins. Columbia Seligman Global Technology Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “The fund held an underweight position in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) relative to the S&P North American Technology Sector, which was a headwind on performance following impressive returns from the company in 2023 and the first two quarters of 2024. NVIDIA’s stock fell during periods of the quarter after the company reported second quarter earnings. While the earnings came in higher than expectations, investors were concerned that the company did not guide earnings high enough, signaling a potential slowdown in AI buildout. NVIDIA’s demand remains strong and the company has forecast orders for upcoming quarters. The question that remains is whether the company can meet the demand for its AI processors and connectivity chips. Our team continues to remain cautious on NVIDIA’s high customer concentration. Microsoft and Meta have driven a significant amount of the company’s revenue, which presents added risk.” Overall, NVDA ranks 4th on our list of buzzing AI stocks this Week. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: BlackRock's Larry Fink: Crypto’s TradFi Savior
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/business/2024/12/10/black-rocks-larry-fink-crypto-s-trad-fi-savior
Time Published: 2024-12-10T15:04:53Z
Full Content:
Larry Fink is nowhere close to being a first mover in cryptocurrencies. Yet, his firm, BlackRock, is making waves regardless and encouraging the rest of Wall Street to join the ride. In 2023, BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, shocked the investment and crypto community by filing for permission to create a bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund. BTC's price soared following a giant of finance's surprising entrance into the crypto realm. In 2024, BlackRock got permission from U.S. regulators, as did several other issuers. Many suspect BlackRock putting its considerable weight behind bitcoin ETFs may have helped sway the Securities and Exchange Commission. This event was an early nominee for Crypto Story of the Year, and while Donald Trump's embrace of crypto on the campaign trail may have overshadowed this, the bitcoin ETF revolution remains high on the leaderboard. The numbers show this. Since the January approval, institutional investors have poured over $30 billion into the ETFs. This isn’t money coming from a tech-savvy crowd, or crypto “degens,” a term used to describe traders who take on high-risk, high-reward trading strategies. It’s capital that’s considered “smart money” given the extensive experience these hedge funds, endowments and other high-caliber firms have. Here's another number: Crypto’s market cap has grown from roughly $1 trillion when BlackRock filed paperwork for its bitcoin ETF to now nearly $3.6 trillion, according to data from Coinmarketcap. We're now in an era when dogecoin (DOGE), the memecoin created as a joke that has absolutely no utility, has a larger market cap than Ford (F) and nearly twice that of Adidas (ADS) — both long-established, highly regarded brands that have been around for many years. Fink's embrace of crypto surely helped pull the crypto industry out of its near-fatal post-FTX-collapse bear market. Waiting for the right moment might just be Larry Fink’s secret sauce. According to Fink, what sets a great company apart from good ones isn’t that they are the earliest adapter of a new trend, but rather their ability — and openness — to regenerate in an ever-changing world. BlackRock didn't invent ETFs. Someone else did in 1993. But Fink's company got huge in that space a decade and a half ago by acquiring iShares, which this year issued BlackRock's bitcoin ETF as well as one that tracks Ethereum's ether (ETH). “There are many bad companies that have just a single product or a few products and don’t reengineer themselves; they don’t look at the ecosystem and see how it’s changing,” Fink said in an interview with Harvard Business Review in 2015. Looking back at BlackRock’s journey in the digital asset space proves that Fink practices what he preaches. The popular narrative that Fink was long opposed to cryptocurrencies — specifically bitcoin — couldn’t be further from the truth. In a 2017 interview, the BlackRock CEO said he was a “big believer in the potential of what a cryptocurrency can do.” However, at the time, its use case didn’t go much beyond being a platform for speculation, he said. Three years later, Fink, again, voiced his belief that the then nascent asset class could possibly "evolve" into a global market asset. But it wasn’t until 2022 that BlackRock really began entering the space, letting certain clients trade crypto. Then came the bitcoin ETF application in 2023 and the product's debut this year. In the process, BlackRock helped transform the entire cryptocurrency industry. “The optics of having one of the most powerful and influential figures in finance throw their support behind crypto ETFs was a clear game-changer,” said Nate Geraci, an ETF expert who has closely followed the journey of crypto ETFs. For professional investors, BlackRock gave crypto a highly validating stamp of approval, opening the gates and allowing billions of dollars of institutional capital to flow into the industry. Bitcoin, still hovering around the $44,000 mark at the beginning of this year, set a new record above $70,000 soon after the ETFs began trading in January. It set new highs above $100,000 in December after more than doubling since the launch of the ETFs. The CoinDesk 20 Index, which tracks 20 of the largest crypto assets, was at one point up 53% weeks after the spot bitcoin ETFs launched in January, spurring hope that it would become a similar catalyst for other crypto assets. “The BlackRock 'seal of approval' carries immense weight with investors, financial advisers and institutional players. Not only did Larry Fink offer this endorsement for spot bitcoin and ether ETFs, but he also publicly championed both underlying assets, enhancing their credibility,” Geraci said. The institutions surely reacted. Nearly 2,000 institutional holders have put money into the spot bitcoin ETFs, including top-tier hedge funds like Treasury Secretary contender Marc Rowan’s Apollo Global Management as well as Izzy Englander’s Elliott Management. Even a pension fund, a university and a city, which are all typically known to make risk-averse investments, bought hundreds of millions worth of the ETFs. BlackRock’s only interest in the digital asset space isn’t just to use it as a speculative asset. It goes far beyond that into the weeds of digitization of financial products or more specifically, real world asset (RWA) tokenization. In March 2024, the asset manager announced a partnership with crypto-native firm Securitize to launch its first tokenized fund, the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), which is issued on the Ethereum blockchain. BUIDL wasn’t the first tokenized Treasury fund to hit the market. Franklin Templeton, for example, had launched its OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund (FOBXX) in 2021, years before BlackRock followed suit. Again, Fink wasn’t the first mover, but it didn’t keep him from rushing to the top in no time. In less than six weeks after its inception, BUIDL became the largest tokenized Treasury fund at $375 million in market cap. The fund now stands at $530 million and continues to be at the top of the list, followed by Hashnote, Ondo and Franklin Templeton’s funds. “This year, Securitize collaborated with BlackRock to launch their first tokenized fund, the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, or BUIDL, which became the largest tokenized treasury fund in AUM in the world, helping to further bridge the gap between the TradFi and crypto markets,” said Carlos Domingo, co-founder and CEO of Securitize. “BlackRock has been publicly supportive of the potential of tokenization to transform capital markets, reinforcing our confidence in this technology, and we’ve been grateful for their commitment to evolving the ecosystem.” The rapid growth in BlackRock’s product pushed the market cap of Tokenized Treasury notes past $2 billion in assets, making it an attractive vehicle for investors looking to take advantage of the rapid rise in Treasury yields over the past few years in an efficient marketplace. The bottom line is this: Fink is not quick to venture out to new technologies. He’s an observer, who makes a move when the timing seems perfect. Most figures in his TradFi circle probably know this, which is why Fink’s devotion to the crypto industry has had such a ripple effect on other heavyweights in the old-school financial crowd. At the end of the day, it’s hard to believe that a pension fund would spend hundreds of millions of dollars on buying bitcoin if it wasn’t for Fink’s approval. “This was essentially the 'Pope of Finance' blessing a new category for mainstream investors,” Geraci said. “The impact of that cannot be understated.” This profile is part of CoinDesk's Most Influential 2024 package.

Title: Eric Trump Predicts Bitcoin To Hit $1 Million In Bold Speech
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/eric-trump-predicts-bitcoin-hit-1-million/
Time Published: 2024-12-10T15:00:50Z

In a keynote delivered Tuesday at the Bitcoin Mena conference in Abu Dhabi, Eric Trump, executive vice president of the Trump Organisation and the son of US president-elect Donald Trump, made a bold forecast for the BTC price. Trump’s speech touched on Bitcoin’s scarcity, global liquidity, and disruptive potential to the traditional financial sector, culminating in a pronouncement that the BTC price will reach $1 million. Throughout the keynote, Trump highlighted the unique advantages of Bitcoin over traditional assets like real estate and gold. He described BTC’s scarcity – the fixed supply of 21 million coins – as a critical driver of value, contrasting it with gold, whose supply could be expanded if prices rose dramatically. “Name another commodity that’s capped. Name another commodity that as prices go up, it’s not further exploited,” he said. Trump noted that if gold soared to $20,000 per ounce, “you’d be tearing down this building” to find more. By contrast, Bitcoin’s hard supply limit cannot be altered. “With Bitcoin, you can’t. With Bitcoin, supply is capped. That scarcity, that hard limit, it makes it incredibly valuable, especially as these assets are being purchased in the billions. That’s why you see the price skyrocket the way it is.” Trump referenced the involvement of major financial institutions, asserting that their participation proves Bitcoin’s significance. “There’s no question that the institutions are petrified. Guys, they’re petrified. Why do you think BlackRock and why do you think Schwab and why do you think, you know, JP Morgan and Fidelity, (0:29) why do you think they’re buying crypto by the billions?” he asked. Drawing on his personal evolution from a skeptic to a believer, Trump referenced early conversations with MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor, a well-known proponent of Bitcoin. “I’ve known Michael Saylor for 20 years. If you want to talk about a great champion for this industry, it’s Michael Saylor,” he said, calling the enterprise software mogul “a national treasure” for his unwavering advocacy and educational efforts. Trump stressed BTC’s superior liquidity and borderless nature compared to traditional hard assets like real estate. “It’s instantly liquid. You can buy or sell it while literally having dinner with your wife or your husband,” he explained, contrasting this ease with the protracted timelines and excessive complexity of selling large real estate holdings. “Try going out and selling a big office building.It will take you 18 months to do. At the end of it, you’re going to want to shoot yourself in frustration,” he said. He also pointed to Bitcoin’s role in financial inclusion, stating that it creates opportunities for people around the globe, regardless of wealth or geography. “Bitcoin is inclusive. It gives everybody the opportunity around the world to participate in ways that they never otherwise would have thought,” he said. “People in developing countries, people who otherwise wouldn’t stand a freaking chance, it gives them tremendous opportunity.” In the most eye-popping statement, Trump turned to BTC’s price performance. He mentioned a key psychological milestone already reached and suggested the next one could further alter mainstream perceptions: “I can tell you a lot of eyes were open when Bitcoin hit $100,000. And I can tell you a hell of a lot of more eyes will be open when Bitcoin hits $1 million.” Trump then added his personal conviction, stating, “I’m confident it’s going to hit $1 million, I think we are all confident in this room that it will hit $1 million.” At press time, BTC traded at $97,620.

Title: Anthony Scaramucci predicts China to create strategic Bitcoin reserve in 2025

Scaramucci's remarks hint at a geopolitical shift as nations prepare for a Bitcoin-inclusive financial strategy. Collision Conf / CC BY 2.0 / Wikimedia. Mixed by CryptoSlate Anthony Scaramucci has projected China’s return to Bitcoin mining and integrating Bitcoin into its reserve assets, making this claim during remarks delivered at the Bitcoin MENA 2024 conference. He suggested that with the United States now signaling a more open stance toward Bitcoin, it would be increasingly difficult for other nations to remain on the sidelines. He added that by this time next year, Chinese authorities may add Bitcoin to their reserves and restore legal mining, reestablishing a role previously restricted by policy actions. His comments imply that geopolitical shifts in Bitcoin policies could influence how governments approach the asset’s strategic value. Global interest in strategic Bitcoin reserves has been gaining momentum this year, with several nations examining avenues to integrate Bitcoin into their financial frameworks to diversify holdings and navigate geopolitical pressures. A Russian lawmaker proposed a national Bitcoin reserve to counter sanctions and stabilize the country’s economic position. Similar discussions have emerged elsewhere, including in Brazil, where legislation was introduced to allocate a portion of the nation’s reserves to Bitcoin. Brazilian officials sought authorization to deploy up to $18.6 billion in Bitcoin reserves, reflecting a broader inclination to leverage the digital asset as a form of resilience. In the United States, government entities have engaged in policy discussions about formal Bitcoin reserves. Scaramucci’s remarks come at a time when the U.S. has shown a willingness to retain and potentially expand its Bitcoin holdings. President Donald Trump pledged to maintain existing federal Bitcoin laws, which set an estimated value of over 200,000 BTC. Further legislative efforts, such as Senator Cynthia Lummis’s proposed bill to acquire significant Bitcoin reserves over a multi-year period, indicate a strategic approach rather than short-term speculation. Other U.S. jurisdictions have followed suit, with Pennsylvania proposing to allocate a share of its reserves to Bitcoin. Corporations, including influential asset managers, have signaled interest in endorsing such measures. BlackRock has signaled possible support for the concept of a U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve. The timing of these developments aligns with the period following the April 2024 Bitcoin halving and the November 2024 U.S. presidential election, after which the asset has experienced notable market strength. Trump’s victory coincided with Bitcoin reaching new highs, cresting above $100,000 before stabilizing near $97,000. This market environment highlights Bitcoin’s emerging role as more than a speculative asset. Governments that consider it a strategic reserve asset appear to be motivated by long-term positioning in global finance rather than short-term opportunity. The Bitcoin Policy Institute advanced arguments for a U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve, highlighting possible financial stability gains, alignment with evolving energy grids, and enhanced global monetary leadership. While proponents of strategic Bitcoin reserves emphasize its potential as a hedge against inflation, a tool for bypassing economic sanctions, and a lever to assert financial independence, questions remain. Skeptics warn about volatility and the prospect of wealth redistribution from taxpayers to Bitcoin holders. Despite these reservations, proponents point to the steady growth in institutional involvement and the interest shown by governments exploring large-scale integration of Bitcoin into their asset pools. Scaramucci’s assertion that China could soon reintegrate Bitcoin into its strategic considerations points to a potential shift that might redefine geopolitical balances in digital finance. With U.S. openness toward Bitcoin and various countries exploring reserves, the notion that China could soon add Bitcoin to its own coffers suggests broadening acceptance of the asset’s role in national financial architectures.

Title: Bloomberg News: Staffing Firm Discriminated Against U.S. Graduates
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/immigration/2024/12/10/bloomberg-news-staffing-firm-discriminated-against-u-s-graduates/
Time Published: 2024-12-10T10:14:22Z
Full Content:
A major U.S.-based company discriminated against U.S. graduates while it used the H-1B visa program to place low-salary Indian graduates into U.S. white-collar jobs, according to a report in Bloomberg News. The company, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation, has repeatedly promised to hire more American graduates, but the pledges were “all smoke and mirrors,” said employee Sonya McLaughlin, a U.S. hiring manager. “The entire business model is built on the back of cheap Indian labor,” she told Bloomberg. “The [Indian] people who are on visas are the people Cognizant wants.” The article is titled “Insiders Tell How IT Giant Favored Indian H-1B Workers Over US Employees.” Bloomberg noted: In October, a jury in a federal class-action lawsuit returned a verdict that found Cognizant intentionally discriminated against more than 2,000 non-Indian employees between 2013 and 2022. The verdict, which echoed a previously undisclosed finding from a 2020 US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission investigation, centered on discrimination claims based on race and national origin. Cognizant, based in Teaneck, New Jersey, was found to have preferred workers from India, most of whom joined the firm’s US workforce of about 32,000 using … visas called H-1Bs. The article sheds some light on an emerging migration problem facing President Donald Trump. He has just been elected on a promise to shut down illegal migration and labor smuggling — but many of his business allies want to protect the inflow of Indian and Chinese college graduates into a huge variety of career-starting jobs needed by young American graduates. The Bloomberg article noted that Cognizant is expected to appeal the jury decision. “Cognizant provides equal employment opportunities for all employees and does not tolerate discrimination in any form,” said a company spokesman. “Cognizant complies with federal laws regarding pay for visa workers …. [and] disagrees that any financial incentive exists to hire visa workers,” the spokesman said. White-Collar Staffing Companies Companies are “offshoring nearly every [white collar] job in America because there is no labor market test” to determine if American graduates are available, said John Miano, a lawyer with the Center for Immigration Studies. President Joe Biden’s pro-migration deputies have accelerated white-collar outsourcing. For example, a major migration law firm reported on December 9: The Department of State (DOS) has released an update of the J-1 Exchange Visitor Skills List (“Skills List”) effective December 9, 2024. The revised list removes a large number of countries and broadens opportunities for current or former J-1 nonimmigrants to remain in or return to the United States. The Cognizant verdict and the Bloomberg article are “validation for what we’ve been doing for the past several years,” Kevin Lynn, founder of U.S. Tech Workers, told Breitbart News. He added: These employment visa programs were designed to displace American graduates, not bring in the best and brightest. There are plenty of [other visa] programs out there that do allow us to bring in the best and brightest, and what we will have to do is have that discussion with [business] groups that are saying they need more skilled immigrants. ‘What we’ll have to do is teach them how to invest in their American workforce and no longer discriminate against their American workforce,” he said, adding: They will be just fine. Innovation and productivity have been the big casualties of this “Indian Era of Displacement” because we have not brought in the best and the brightest. We brought in very ordinary workers, and so innovation and productivity have taken hits, and so has American competitiveness … We have large numbers of Indians who are now in management positions, hiring and promoting their own. That’s a huge hit to professionalism because it’s not a meritocracy. After-inflation salaries for U.S. graduates have stalled since 2000, even as housing prices have exploded, according to Stastista.com. Since 2008, “compensation grew at a rate of just 0.15 percent per year” for technology graduates, the Center for Immigration Studies reported on August 30. Meanwhile, business groups are demanding more white-collar migration. Many of the American graduates who are pushed off the career ladder by visa workers never regain their income or career prospects. The underlying problem, Lynn said, is that Wall Street and corporate managers want cheap labor for immediate profits. That policy destroys innovation, professionalism, and productivity at companies such as Boeing and Intel Corp. he said. “This efficiency model is what white-collar Americans have been suffering under for the last three decades,” Lynn said. In contrast, Elon Musk’s rocket business cannot use visa workers because of Cold War restrictions on the export of technology. The Bloomberg report includes comments and legal testimony from U.S. graduates who worked at Cognizant, For example, Abby Israel was hired to oversee the enforcement of anti-discrimination laws, Bloomberg wrote: In 2018, Israel’s team produced an internal report that found large racial disparities in rates of “involuntary terminations” at Cognizant over the first eight months of the year. Black employees were let go at a rate 23 times that of Asian [mostly Indian] workers, the data showed. For Hispanic or Latino employees, the rate was 16 times the rate of their Asian counterparts. For White workers, it was eight times as high. (The Asian workers were overwhelmingly from India and were working on [H-1B and other] visas, according to the report.) Israel told the jury that those were some of the most extreme racial disparities she’d ever seen. She also said that when she reached out to Cognizant’s hiring managers with those findings, her supervisor told her to stop sharing the data beyond HR leaders. The huge supply of compliant visa workers also allows C-Suite managers to ignore the advice of U.S. professionals. Bloomberg reported one example: When Christy Palmer joined Cognizant in 2013, she relished the opportunity to work at a multinational corporation that served some of the most iconic US companies. It wasn’t long before she began to feel out of place, uncomfortable and, at times, intimidated, she said during court proceedings and interviews with Bloomberg. At a client meeting in 2015, a Cognizant director was struggling to respond to questions about a report Palmer had written, so she tried to step in with an answer. According to Palmer and another person present, the director cut her off, swearing loudly at her to shut up. Numbers At least 250,000 new mid-skilled workers annually arrive seeking U.S. starter white-collar jobs. They come with H-1B, L-1, H4EAD, or L-1 work visas, with Optional Practical Training (OPT) work permits granted after college enrollment, or by using tourist visas to sneak past airport customs officers. Once in the United States, most of the migrants are absorbed by the many corrupt ethnic-hiring and job-selling networks that exclude millions of ordinary American graduates. Most of the visa workers are rented out to brand-name U.S. firms by many staffing agencies run by Indian managers. Both Facebook and Apple have been fined token sums after the federal government found evidence of discrimination against Americans. Foreign white-collar visa workers hold at least 2 million jobs that would otherwise go to young American graduates. The replacement workers are very profitable to tech investors who gain roughly $20 in stock value for every dollar saved in salaries. Cognizant is a staffing firm launched in India in 1994 by India-0rigin immigrants working for Wall Street’s Dun & Bradstreet. The company is now based in Teaneck, N.J., and the board reports mostly to the large-scale investors — including Vanguard and BlackRock — who own at least 50 percent of the company’s stock. Many lower-cost, mid-skilled Indian graduates who work for U.S. staffing firms expect to get U.S. residency and citizenship in exchange for years of hard work and low pay in the United States. In turn, India’s government uses diplomacy and trade deals to help export its graduates to U.S. jobs. It also works with allies — such as the India Caucus in Congress — to protect the white-collar staffing companies that are hired by Fortune 500 executives and investors. The lawsuit is Palmer v. Cognizant Tech. Solutions Corp., 17-cv-06848, US District Court, Central District of California in Los Angeles. Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting. Copyright © 2024 Breitbart

First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB) has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Libre Capital, the tokenization specialist backed by WebN Group and Nomura’s Laser Digital, to do blockchain-based collateralized lending using real world asset (RWAs) tokens.Since going live in March, Libre has issued about $150 million of tokenized versions of Brevan Howard funds, Hamilton Lane's fixed-income type products, and a BlackRock money-market fund. Under the MoU, First Abu Dhabi Bank is piloting a credit line for approved lenders to provide stablecoin lending with those Libre issued tokens as collateral.Holders of all sorts of crypto assets enthusiastically use their tokens as collateral to borrow against. In this case Libre, which already proposed the use of its blue chip RWA tokens as collateral on a MakerDAO forum in September, has brought a $335 billion bank into the mix. FAB will be handling liquidity through lending credit lines on Libre’s assets on public chains like Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, NEAR, Aptos and Coinbase’s layer2 network BASE.Libre’s collateralized lending offering is part of an initiative the firm calls “Project HODL” (short for High-Yield Optimized Decentralized Liquidity).“We've been working on adding utility to our AUM in the form of collateralized lending,” said Dr. Avtar Sehra, founder and CEO of Libre in an interview. “Essentially it's an on-chain infrastructure that allows these RWAs to be used as collateral. The lending is all in stablecoins, not in fiat, and is being provided through existing lenders, like broker dealers, or Laser Digital, and now they are getting credit lines from providers like FAB.”At a signing of the MoU in the UAE, Sameh Al Qubaisi, group head of global markets at FAB said the Libre initiative underscores the bank’s commitment to drive innovation in the region.“Through this initiative, FAB aims to enable secure credit facilities backed by tokenized assets, with automated processes ensuring robust risk management and complete regulatory compliance,” AlQubaisi said in a statement.

Title: Market Reacts To Trump’s Crypto Support: Almost $10 Billion Invested In US Bitcoin ETFs

Since Donald Trump became president-elect a little more than a month ago, roughly $10 billion has flooded into US spot Bitcoin ETFs, showing growing optimism that his administration will support the cryptocurrency industry. According to Bloomberg, a dozen funds from big issuers including BlackRock and Fidelity Investments have received around $9.9 billion in net inflows into their various Bitcoin ETFs since November 5, bringing their total assets to around $113 billion. Trump’s recent selections, such as a digital asset champion to lead the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the creation of a White House czar for artificial intelligence and crypto, indicate a shift toward a more friendly regulatory climate. Notably, Trump has praised the concept of establishing a national Bitcoin reserve, which is gaining bipartisan support in Congress, with pro-crypto Senator Cynthia Lummis at the lead. Bitcoin recently surpassed the $100,000 mark for the first time on December 5, trading at around $96,898 as of Monday. The cryptocurrency’s six-week winning streak is the longest since the market frenzy of 2021, but analysts remain concerned about volatility. David Lawant, head of research at crypto premier broker FalconX, noted that a sustained push above the $100,000 milestone will most likely necessitate other positive catalysts, as BTC has struggled to recapture this level while stabilizing after the advance over the last four days. Bloomberg also notes that the positive atmosphere surrounding cryptocurrencies has resulted in a substantial rebound among companies that have followed MicroStrategy’s strategy of selling convertible bonds to fund Bitcoin purchases. MicroStrategy alone sold $6.2 billion in convertibles this year and intends to raise an additional $21 billion through fixed-income offerings. Other companies, including MARA Holdings and Core Scientific, have successfully obtained significant funds to support their Bitcoin acquisitions. MicroStrategy’s stock, MSTR, has risen 73% since Donald Trump’s election, while MARA, Riot Platforms, and Core Scientific’s shares have increased by 63%, 33%, and 30%, respectively. This trend closely resembles Bitcoin’s nearly 40% growth within the same period. With a market capitalization approaching $2 trillion, Bitcoin’s recent ascent has dramatically increased MicroStrategy’s assets, which are now worth more than $41 billion. The terms of recent crypto-related convertible deals stand out, particularly because many are structured with zero coupons, allowing investors to engage in convertible arbitrage. Despite the high demand for these instruments, there appears to be little anxiety about prospective Bitcoin price decreases. Raj Imteaz, head of convertible and equity derivatives advisory at ICR Capital LLC, noted that larger players in the market feel compelled to issue convertibles to remain competitive. “If your competitor has a large war chest funded at very low coupons and you haven’t tapped the market, you’re at a competitive disadvantage,” he said. “You almost have to issue converts to stay competitive within crypto.” Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com Ronaldo is an experienced crypto enthusiast dedicated to the nascent and ever-evolving industry.

Title: Bitcoin slips below $100K as corporate interest soars: Is $120K the next target? (Prakash Bhudia)

Bitcoin fell slightly on Monday, cooling after a weekend rally that saw it reach a record high of $103,719 on December 4. By December 6, Bitcoin was trading at $98,658, marking a 13.53% pullback and wiping out over $1.5 billion in leveraged positions. While the dip highlights market volatility, BTC’s year-to-date (YTD) gains of 130% affirm its dominance as a key player in global finance. This retreat comes amid optimism over President-elect Donald Trump’s crypto-friendly policies, increased corporate interest in Bitcoin, and concerns over large-scale liquidations from Mt. Gox-related wallets. Bitcoin’s rally was fueled by expectations of regulatory clarity under Trump’s administration. The nomination of Paul Atkins as SEC Chair and pro-crypto picks for key economic positions signaled a potential boom for the digital asset sector. Trump has promised to make the U.S. the “crypto capital” of the world and floated the idea of a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, sparking optimism despite skepticism over its feasibility. Amazon has emerged as the latest major company to consider adopting Bitcoin. During the 2025 shareholders meeting on December 6, shareholders petitioned Amazon’s board to explore adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet. With $88 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, Amazon is well-positioned to make a significant impact by diversifying into Bitcoin. Shareholders highlighted Bitcoin’s superior returns—131% over the past year and 1,246% over the last five years—compared to corporate bonds. The document also emphasized MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin-focused strategy, which has driven its stock to outperform Amazon by 537% over the past year, as a compelling precedent. These discussions come at a time when institutional interest in Bitcoin is rising sharply. The $2.4 billion inflows into Spot Bitcoin ETFs not only underscore Bitcoin’s growing acceptance but also make a strong case for corporate adoption. Major players like Tesla and Block have already added Bitcoin to their balance sheets, and Amazon’s institutional investors—such as BlackRock and Fidelity—are major proponents of Bitcoin ETFs. If Amazon moves forward, it could trigger a broader corporate trend, driving even greater demand for Bitcoin. Source: Coinglass Bitcoin’s retracement below $100,000 was driven by several market forces. Profit-taking played a significant role, with Chinese tech company Meitu selling 940 BTC and 31,000 ETH to realize $80 million in profits. This triggered broader selling pressure, leading to market liquidations of over $1.5 billion in leveraged positions, which further amplified the decline. Adding to the bearish sentiment, movements of $2 billion worth of coins from Mt. Gox wallets raised fears of a creditor distribution, potentially flooding the market with supply. Bitcoin’s volatility reignited debates between skeptics and advocates. Economist Peter Schiff dismissed the rally as being driven by government manipulation, claiming it lacked organic market support. However, crypto advocates countered his arguments, highlighting Bitcoin’s status as a truly free-market asset compared to gold, which often depends on government support. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao celebrated the milestone and encouraged the community to remain focused, stating, “Keep building.” Despite its recent retreat, Bitcoin remains near its all-time highs, and analysts remain optimistic about recovery. Trump’s upcoming policy announcements, growing corporate adoption led by companies like Amazon, and Bitcoin’s robust market fundamentals suggest further potential for gains as 2024 draws to a close. Bitcoin’s retreat below $100K underscores its volatility but doesn’t overshadow its significance. It is no longer just a speculative asset—it is a cornerstone of financial innovation, challenging traditional systems and shaping the future of global finance. At the time of writing, BTC has dipped just below $100,000 with bullish signals still evident. However, RSI slightly dipping below 70 could be a hint for a pause on bullish momentum. Buyers could find a hurdle at the $104,000 mark with sellers potentially being held at the $96,000 and $92,160 support levels.
