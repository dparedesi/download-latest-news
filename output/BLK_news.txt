Title: Ireland under-20s make three changes to starting team for Scotland clash
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2025/02/06/ireland-under-20s-make-three-changes-to-starting-team-for-scotland-clash/
Time Published: 2025-02-06T17:36:40Z
Full Content:
Ireland under-20 head coach Neil Doak has made three changes and two positional switches to the starting team from that which lost 19-3 against England for Saturday night’s game against Scotland at the Hive stadium in Edinburgh (7.45pm, live on RTÉ2). There are a couple of alterations enforced by injuries to rightwing Derry Moloney, who broke a finger but could be back in time for the Wales match, and loosehead prop Alex Usanov; he suffered a leg injury that will see him miss the remainder of the tournament. Secondrow prospect Alan Spicer, who was sorely missed in Cork, has a small stress fracture in his foot but it doesn’t require surgery. His progress will be monitored. Daniel Green, an outhalf by inclination, comes in at fullback with Charlie Molony switching to the rightwing in place of Derry Moloney. Gene O’Leary Kareem swaps a place on the bench for the 13 jersey and will partner Ireland’s outstanding player the last day, Connor Fahy, who moves in one place to inside centre, in the midfield. Cork Constitution’s Eoghan Smyth drops to the replacements. Former Newbridge pupil Billy Bohan, who replaced Usanov after 14 minutes at Musgrave Park, is named in the run-on side with Blackrock College prop Paddy Moore, a son of former Blackrock, Clontarf and a former schools international Dave, promoted to the replacements. There is one other change to the bench with Sale Sharks scrumhalf Will Wootton, younger brother of Alex, fit again following injury. Ireland are looking to atone for a largely poor performance against England that was riddled with mistakes and indiscipline, albeit against a big, physical England side. They take on a Scotland side that lost 22-10 to Italy in the opening round of fixtures at Saturday’s venue. Irish under-20s back coach Ian Keatley explained that while they wanted the defeat to “hurt” a little, it is important that the group don’t become inhibited by the setback. It is a case of learn, move on, and be better. “Obviously, frustration [was the overwhelming feeling in the immediate aftermath of the game] because we felt that the squad of boys were capable of much more. And we know we came up against [an] English team [that] everyone thought that we didn’t stand a chance [of beating]. “But I think the frustrating part was that we created chances. I think we got inside their 22 nine or 10 times, and we didn’t come away with any tries. While they got into our 22 five times and came away with one try. “When you look back, look at the stats and how the game went, we had 17 penalties against us as opposed to their 10. There were a lot of unforced errors, just little mistakes; it’s frustrating that we just didn’t take any of our chances. “In reviewing the game, you have to be very balanced. You do want them to hurt a little bit and that it is okay [to feel that way] but then bounce back in training this week.” Ireland Under-20: D Green (QUB); C Molony (UCD), G O’Leary Kareem (UCC), C Fahy (Clontarf), C Mangan (Blackrock College); S Wisniewski (Old Belvedere), C Logan (QUB); B Bohan (Galway Corinthians), H Walker (QUB), A Mullan (Blackrock College); M Ronan (Old Wesley), B Corrigan (Old Wesley); M Foy (UCC), B Power (Galwegians), É McCarthy (Galwegians, capt). Replacements: C Magee (Banbridge), P Moore (Blackrock College), T McAllister (Ballynahinch), D Walsh (Terenure College), O Minogue (Shannon), W Wootton (Sale Sharks), D Hicks (Garryowen), E Smyth (Cork Constitution).

Title: Ethereum’s Price Still In The Major Uptrend – Analyst Forecast Potential For Further Gains
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-in-the-major-uptrend/
Time Published: 2025-02-06T16:00:12Z
Full Content:
With the general crypto market still facing heightened volatility, Ethereum has once again failed to reclaim the pivotal $3,000 price level. Bearish pressure continues to linger in its price action, leading to speculations about its potential in the short term. Although ETH has failed to experience a major surge, analysts believe the altcoin could see a turnaround towards the upside shortly. Ethereum may have seen a notable decline in the last few days, but Ether Naysonal, a market expert and trader is unshaken about the heightened volatility. According to the technical expert, “ETH is still in its major uptrend,” indicating resilience amid broader market volatility. Despite occasional pullbacks, the expert cites that ETH continues to hold key support levels, reinforcing optimistic sentiment among investors. With the altcoin maintaining its uptrend, it could pave the way for a potential breakout toward higher levels in the upcoming weeks. Ether Naysonal highlighted alongside maintaining its major uptrend, ETH has also consistently held the $2,615 support level, which is good for its price action. However, for Ethereum to make a quick recovery, it must at least close above the $2,820 mark for one day. A close above the $2,820 level would likely reignite bullish momentum for the altcoin again. Meanwhile. the much-anticipated pump will be triggered if the candle closes above $2,923. Ethereum has experienced remarkable adoption and interest in spite of occasional price corrections. This growing institutional interest coupled with rising on-activity might serve as key factors bolstering the expected upside move. Ether Naysonal has questioned the actions of individuals presently offloading their ETH holdings despite institutional investors accumulating ETH at a huge scale. Major companies are currently seen acquiring ETH in current market conditions. Financial behemoth and asset manager firm Blackrock has purchased over 100,535 ETH, valued at $284 million. Furthermore, asset management company Fidelity has also acquired about 9,552 ETH, worth around $26.39 million. While the biggest global investment institutions are still purchasing, the analyst asserts it is completely illogical for individual investors to sell after being exposed to misleading waves within a short period. Several bullish structures have emerged on ETH’s chart, suggesting a possible rebound in the short term. With upside momentum building for ETH, the asset may be set for a rally toward a new all-time high. After examining Ethereum’s price action, market expert Jonathan Carter highlighted that the asset is still trading within a Symmetrical Triangle pattern in the weekly time frame. Carter noted that liquidity was collected below support by recent downward wicks before returning to the pattern. Once ETH breaks out of the ascending triangle, Carter anticipates a push towards higher targets such as $3,100, $4,000, $4,850, $6,000, and $7,500 in the long term.

Title: Prime Minister’s global investment summit crucial to Luxon’s year of growth - Matthew Hooton

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. Prime Minister Christopher Luxon and new Economic Growth Minister Nicola Willis need to get their ducks lined up ahead of a global investment summit in five weeks. Photo / Alex Burton THREE KEY FACTS The Prime Minister’s global investment summit is just five weeks away. It is the single most important personal initiative Christopher Luxon will take in his year of economic growth. His reputation – and, more importantly, New Zealand’s credibility as a place to invest money – depends on its success. Large, meaningful investments being contracted at the summit or in the weeks following would signal an endorsement of New Zealand’s economic outlook by the world’s smartest financiers, generating a snowball effect. Their absence would do the opposite, communicating to the world’s investment community that they had taken a good look at New Zealand and found its future wanting. Senior officials, business leaders and ministers have warned Luxon that his summit cannot just be a place for cynical “announceables” or, worse, Jacinda Ardern’s infamous “announcements of announcements”. It must deliver actual investments, which is why Luxon ordered work last year on prospectuses outlining immediately investable propositions. A close prime ministerial eye, drawing on his own business experience, is needed to ensure they are credible. The PM chose the dates for the conference, March 13 and 14, to suit key American investors. It speaks to Luxon’s enormous self-confidence in his persuasive abilities that he has bet Muslim investors he has met in Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates will travel to New Zealand almost exactly in the middle of Ramadan. A first measure of the summit’s success will be attracting interest from the world’s largest sovereign wealth and asset-management funds. New Zealand has had a good relationship with the biggest, BlackRock, with its $18.4 trillion under management. After Ardern met BlackRock’s Larry Fink in New York in 2022, her successor Chris Hipkins could announce a $2 billion BlackRock investment in renewable energy shortly before the election, although it isn’t clear what, if anything, it will deliver. Luxon also needs other major private-sector funds like Vanguard, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, UBS and Deutsche Bank to attend, each managing over $2t of assets. Among sovereign wealth funds, New Zealand has tried unsuccessfully to attract the interest of Norway’s Government Pension Fund, originally established with revenues from its oil industry and now managing over $3t of assets. Luxon’s recent visit to the Middle East has hopefully ensured other trillion-dollar-plus oil-based funds from the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia will show up. Closer to home, Singapore’s Temasek and Australia’s Future Fund will surely be in the room, along with China’s major $2t-plus funds. Given Luxon’s links as a former chief executive and president of Unilever Canada, that country’s federal pension fund and famous Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan and CDPQ funds will be high on his list. It’s also important that smaller funds and individuals with existing personal or commercial relationships with New Zealand are included. Most New Zealand investments are much too small for the big funds to have the management resources to bother with. But, famously, the likes of the late Julian Robertson poured hundreds of millions into New Zealand, obviously seeking a decent return but also out of love for the country. In his will, Robertson donated around a quarter-billion dollars of masterpieces to Auckland Art Gallery. Individuals like Robertson can do what they like with their wealth, answering only to their families. Those investing funds on behalf of others have a duty not to be influenced by sentiment. Their assessments of the business environment, the long-term economic outlook and – most of all – the expected rate of return are paramount. Even conservative funds expect around a 7% return to be interested, and others much more. Our own Superannuation Fund, one of the best performing sovereign wealth funds in recent years, would want 10%. Given its purpose, it would be immoral for even it to invest in New Zealand projects if it expected to lose money compared with what it could earn elsewhere. The same is true for everyone else managing other people’s money who Luxon invites to his summit. Rah-rah speeches, corporate videos or other generic marketing material must be and are ignored. The Government’s overseas investment reforms need to be agreed upon among the coalition partners and passed by Parliament in the next five weeks or the summit is probably best cancelled. Likewise, Finance Minister Nicola Willis has finally been given the prime-ministerial nod to talk about company-tax cuts, but the Budget on May 22 is far too late for any cuts to be confirmed, along with necessary compensating tax increases to avoid worsening the fiscal deficit. Willis must deliver on her promise to be bold. Little tax tweaks will make no difference. At 28%, our company rate is well above all the countries on which Luxon says his year of growth is modelled. Ireland’s is 12.5% and Singapore’s 17%. Even the likes of social-democratic Sweden and Denmark tax companies at only 21% and 22% respectively. If Luxon and Willis believe lowering the company tax rate is necessary to attract investment – and even some right-leaning economists dispute that – cutting it by two or three percentage points would achieve nothing. Similarly, as The Economist highlighted to its global readers on its cover this week, the world is going through a period of rapid and radical deregulation, including in Washington, Buenos Aires, Delhi, London and even Brussels. Every day New Zealand procrastinates we fall even further behind. Ideally, Infrastructure Minister Chris Bishop will present his bill to fully reform the Resource Management Act before the summit. At the least, he could rush through legislation so that any projects funded at the summit will receive the same fast-track treatment as the 149 identified in his stop-gap legislation last year. More importantly, Regulation Minister David Seymour needs a rev-up from his boss. His Ministry for Regulation already smells like just another Wellington talk shop. So far, it is reviewing just three sectors, the early childhood education market, agricultural and horticultural products like fertilisers and pesticides, and hairdressing. Since its inception over 30 years ago, Act has argued New Zealand is over-regulated. It surely has a list of regulations to deliver to Luxon that could be repealed in the five weeks before the summit. If not, what hope is there that Seymour’s Wellington bureaucrats will find any thereafter? The Prime Minister raised expectations with his State of the Nation speech a fortnight ago. He has managed Waitangi Day well, by staying away from this year’s circus up north and giving an inspiring speech at Ngāi Tahu’s historic Ōnuku Marae. If he can’t or won’t deliver substance behind both before the summit, his year of economic growth risks going the way of Ardern’s 2019 year of delivery.

Title: ‘We’ve lost 11 days of school ... attendance has collapsed‘: Principals on the enduring effects of Storm Éowyn
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/education/2025/02/06/weve-lost-11-days-of-school-attendance-has-collapsed-principals-on-the-enduring-effects-of-storm-eowyn/
Time Published: 2025-02-06T15:47:32Z
Full Content:
Noel Loftus, principal of St Attracta’s National School in Ballaghdereen, Co Roscommon, is still counting the cost of a week without electricity in the aftermath of Storm Éowyn. It was the third enforced closure of the academic year. The school lost two days following Storm Darragh in December, four days due to snow and ice and five days following last week’s power cuts. School attendance at the school – designated as disadvantaged or Deis – has “collapsed”, he says, after making significant progress over recent times. Teachers are also under pressure to catch up with literacy and numeracy targets. The school isn’t alone. By the end of last week some 322 schools had been without power for a week. Numbers fell to 150 early this week – mostly in the Galway, Mayo, Leitrim and Roscommon area. On Thursday of this week a single school in Curry, Co Sligo was without power. A total of about 10,000 homes, meanwhile, have yet to be reconnected. A spokesman for ESB Networks said “full restoration is within our sights”. Many school leaders, however, say they feel they were left adrift by authorities with little contact or evidence that their needs were being prioritised since the storm hit. Some say there is an urgent need to provide emergency access to generators or to ensure schools are at the front of the queue for reconnection in the event of future power outages. “It’s caused consternation,” says one deputy principal of a school in Mayo, who asked not to be named. “Students were facing into mocks and parents were stressed out. We weren’t able to give any guarantees when power would be back.” While power is back, the enduring effects of closures linger. “The school day and year is short, the curriculum is broad and the needs of the children are extensive,” Loftus says. “We’ve been shocked at the impact [of school closures]. When children are not in school, we can’t progress their learning to the targets we have. We have a significant cohort of disadvantaged children – Roma children and others. “Attendance is something we work really hard on. But when you lose that connection with school it takes a long time to build it back up.” To make up for lost tuition time, he says in-school teacher training and sports activities are being postponed to allow for “class contact catch-up time”. There is lingering frustration, meanwhile, among school leaders. Principals say they accept adverse weather conditions will pose challenges, but many feel urgent lessons need to be learned to ensure schools are not left for weeks without power. “There will be other storms and I don’t want to close for a fourth time. If schools can’t get power restored quickly, can there be access to generators?” Loftus says. Minister for Education Helen McEntee said this week she has asked her department to see how authorities can work more quickly to get a better picture of the volume of schools affected and provide speedy access to generators where possible. A spokesman for ESB Networks said it appreciated the frustration of school communities and it had worked closely with the Department of Education to make progress in the face of “unprecedented” circumstances. For now, Loftus says, staff are left asking where schools stand in the eyes of authorities. “We’re an award-winning school in sport and music with a range of highly successful initiatives in literacy and numeracy. It’s for these reasons we feel so strongly about feeling locked out of our school, without any urgency on the part of Government to respond to our plight. “It makes you feel you’re less significant despite the role we play in the lives of children. Rural schools were left to drift. Would this happen in Blackrock in Dublin? I don’t think so.” © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Ondo Finance Launches Tokenized RWA-Focused Layer-1 Blockchain

New York, NY — Ondo Finance, the second-largest tokenized Treasuries issuer, said it plans to start its own layer-1 blockchain designed for tokenized real-world assets in a bid to connect traditional capital markets with decentralized finance, the company announced on Thursday at its inaugural Ondo Summit. Ondo Chain was crafted to meet institutional compliance standards while maintaining the transparency and accessibility of public blockchains like Ethereum, the company said. The network will rely on permissioned validators to verify transactions and ensure accurate financial data, such as asset prices and token backing. It will also support staking of tokenized real-world assets and native bridging between blockchains for interoperability. "Financial markets are overdue for an upgrade," CEO Nathan Allman said in a statement. "We’re creating an ecosystem that bridges the best of traditional finance with blockchain technology.” ONDO, the native token of the ecosystem, saw volatile swings following the announcement, dipping 1.5% before rallying 3.5% higher. Soon following the announcement World Liberty Financial, the decentralized finance protocol backed by Donald Trump and his family, invested $470,000 in ONDO tokens, blockchain data showed. "We really set out to build something that could combine the best of both traditional finance with its incredible deep liquidity and investor protections with all the benefits of DeFi with its open access and innovation and new primitives," Ian De Bode, chief strategy officer at Ondo, said during a presentation at the Ondo Summit in New York City on Thursday. "However, as we set out on this mission, we realized that the necessary conditions to really bring together really did not exist. The infrastructure to bring these two together really was not present" The announcement comes the day after Ondo unveiled a tokenization platform that helps place stocks, bonds and funds on blockchain rails. Allman said that he believes that with a new administration in place, it could take two to three years to achieve meaningful adoption for tokenized real-world assets. Tokenization, or the creation of digital tokens that represent ownership of traditional assets on a blockchain, is gaining traction globally. Institutions and even governments are increasingly exploring the process in pursuit of operational efficiency gains like speedier settlements and broader investor accessibility. The tokenized RWA market could grow to trillions of dollars through this decade, reports from McKinsey, BCG, 21Shares and Bernstein have projected. Recently, several influential leaders in the financial world touted tokenized RWAs as the next frontier of financial innovation. Larry Fink, CEO of asset management behemoth BlackRock, said bonds and stocks will be traded on blockchain rails in the future and urged U.S. regulators and policymakers to create rules for security tokens. Vlad Tenev, co-founder and CEO of digital brokerage Robinhood, said tokenization could democratize access to private equity investment, which is currently limited to accredited investors and wealthy individuals, and proposed rule changes to unlock tokenized asset investments for retail investors. Ondo Finance is the second largest issuer of tokenized U.S. Treasuries offerings, according to rwa.xyz data. The protocol's U.S. Dollar Yield (USDY) and Short-Term US Government Bond (OUSG) tokens stand at $385 million and $268 million market capitalization, respectively. UPDATE (Feb. 6, 2025, 15:36 UTC): Adds quotes and ONDO price move. UPDATE (Feb. 6, 2025, 17:50 UTC): Adds World Liberty Financial's ONDO token investment.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Rebound Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (NASDAQ:APOG) stands against the other rebound stocks. The United States economy is in a constant state of flux. In recent weeks, moderated growth, evolving monetary policies, and significant trade developments have impacted the overall outlook for the economy. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) anticipates a deceleration in US economic growth, projecting a decrease from 2.6% in 2024 to 1.6% in 2025. This slowdown is expected to be mitigated by monetary policy easing, with policy interest rates projected to decline by an additional 1.5 percentage points by the end of 2025, aligning rates toward neutral levels. Contrastingly, Goldman Sachs offers a more optimistic outlook, forecasting a 2.5% growth in US GDP for 2025, surpassing the consensus estimate of 1.9%. Chief US Economist David Mericle emphasizes the diminishing recession fears, noting that inflation is trending back toward 2%, and the labor market has rebalanced but remains strong. However, potential policy changes, including increased tariffs and reduced immigration, could influence this trajectory. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Recent trade policies have introduced uncertainties into the economic landscape. President Trump's announcement of 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, and 10% on Chinese imports, has led to swift retaliatory measures and heightened fears of a global trade war. Major stock indices, including Germany's DAX, France's CAC, and the UK's FTSE 100, experienced declines. In the US, the Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq futures indicated drops as well. Analysts express concerns that these tariffs could increase consumer prices, affect corporate profits, and potentially lead to recessions in both Mexico and Canada. Financial institutions such as JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank, and Goldman Sachs are revising their economic forecasts, considering potential court injunctions against the tariffs, and evaluating broader economic impacts, including inflation hikes and growth decreases.

Title: 'It's a disaster': Students missing college and carers late for appointments due to ghost buses

Advertising revenue goes some way to support our mission, but this year it has not been enough. If you've seen value in our reporting, please contribute what you can, so we can continue to produce accurate and meaningful journalism. For everyone who needs it. BUSES BEING CANCELLED or not showing up as scheduled are causing people in Dublin to be late for work or school, politicians have warned. There have been multiple reports of certain buses on routes operated by Go-Ahead Ireland being cancelled with little notice, as well as so-called ‘ghost buses’ that appear to be en route – based on information on the app or bus stop signs – but never turn up. Issues have been reported with a number of routes including the N6 (Finglas to Kilbarrack via Ballymun), N2 (Clontarf Road to Heuston Station), S6 (Tallaght to Blackrock) and S4 (Liffey Valley to UCD). A number of issues have also been reported with routes which are part of the latest phase of the rollout of BusConnects services, which was launched on 26 January. People Before Profit Councillor Conor Reddy, who represents the Ballymun-Finglas area, told The Journal ghost buses are “a city-wide problem”. Multiple people have contacted him about ghost buses and cancelled services, saying they have been late to work or college as a result. “It’s having a real impact. I had calls yesterday from two carers who are from Ballymun but work in the Coolock and Kilbarrack areas – it meant that they couldn’t make care visits on time. “When you’re on the clock, if you’re home-help, it can have a huge consequence for the person that you’re caring for, as well as a very limited allocation of time given over to them. So, it’s been a disaster.” #Dáil Topical Issue 3: Paul Murphy @paulmurphy_TD - To the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine - To discuss bus services provided by Go Ahead Ireland. #SeeForYourselfhttps://t.co/TvtNmjTv4T pic.twitter.com/aRaX2GsiOF— Houses of the Oireachtas - Tithe an Oireachtais (@OireachtasNews) February 5, 2025 #Dáil Topical Issue 3: Paul Murphy @paulmurphy_TD - To the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine - To discuss bus services provided by Go Ahead Ireland. #SeeForYourselfhttps://t.co/TvtNmjTv4T pic.twitter.com/aRaX2GsiOF People Before Profit TD for Dublin South West Paul Murphy also raised the issue in Dáil last night, saying he had been “inundated with complaints about Go-Ahead buses not showing up”. “Cancellations and ghost busses have been an ongoing issue with these privatised routes, but in the last few weeks it has gotten absolutely ridiculous. “A UCD student contacted me to say he was late for lectures three days in a row because of cancellations, delays, and overloaded S6s that didn’t stop. He says, ‘Many young people like me are considering buying cars because public transport is so unreliable’.” Advertisement Go-Ahead Ireland, which operates several bus routes across the Greater Dublin Area, confirmed it is aware of the issues and apologised to passengers. A spokesperson for the company said the service disruptions are due to staffing issues and illness. “There is currently a shortage of mechanics impacting transport operators nationally. “This issue has been further aggravated by seasonal illnesses which has reduced the current number of active mechanics able to service our fleet at a given time.” Reddy believes some of the recruitment issues are because of “poor pay and conditions”, saying it’s a consequence of privatisation of bus services. The Go-Ahead spokesperson told The Journal the company has been running “a dedicated mechanics recruitment campaign offering a comprehensive and competitive package for candidates”. As well as the recruitment campaign, Go-Ahead is investing in its apprenticeship programme and “exploring alternative candidate pools outside of Ireland to fulfil our rosters as soon as possible”, they added. This is not the first time there have been issues with bus services operated by Go-Ahead. In 2023, the National Transport Authority (NTA) imposed performance-related penalties of €1.1 million on Go-Ahead and just over €3 million in 2022. A spokesperson for the NTA said the organisation “is monitoring the situation closely, and is receiving daily reports from Go Ahead”. “The operator expects this to continue to improve in the coming days. The Authority has requested a remedial plan from the operator to include details of when services are expected to return to full timetable on each route.” Speaking about the ongoing rollout of BusConnects services, Reddy said he is “in principle, fully supportive of the idea” and its goal of improving connectivity across Dublin. However, he said that while some areas are benefitting, others have been left behind. The councillor said older people or people with disabilities in Ballymun are struggling to access services, for example. “There are large parts of Ballymun where people have to walk 15 minutes or more to get to one of the new bus routes. “So there was an opportunity, I think, with BusConnects that was missed – an opportunity to reconnect parts of Ballymun that had a bus service in the past with the new network, and it wasn’t taken unfortunately.” Readers like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...

Title: House bill seeks to curb corporate purchases of single-family homes (FL)

Skip to comments. Posted on 02/06/2025 4:35:56 AM PST by Jacquerie A House bill filed on Wednesday would limit corporations and investment firms from buying up single-family homes and converting them into rentals, giving local governments the authority to restrict investor-owned housing. The Strengthening Home Ownership in Florida Act (HB 401), filed by Rep. Berny Jacques, seeks to protect homeownership opportunities by keeping more properties in the hands of individual buyers. The measure allows counties and cities to zone land exclusively for owner-occupied homes, preventing large-scale rental conversions in certain areas. It additionally creates a new classification, “single-family hybrid housing,” which applies to homes primarily used as rentals and owned by corporations, investment groups, or related entities. Under the proposal, an individual or related entity cannot own more than three single-family properties in a county and still qualify for residential zoning. Local governments would have broad authority to enforce these rules through zoning and land-use regulations. Under the bill’s purview, municipalities could prohibit hybrid housing in designated areas while still allowing it elsewhere. The bill also includes exemptions for builders and developers, allowing them to construct and sell new homes without restrictions as long as the properties are unoccupied and intended for sale.

It additionally creates a new classification, “single-family hybrid housing,” which applies to homes primarily used as rentals and owned by corporations, investment groups, or related entities. Under the proposal, an individual or related entity cannot own more than three single-family properties in a county and still qualify for residential zoning. Local governments would have broad authority to enforce these rules through zoning and land-use regulations. Under the bill’s purview, municipalities could prohibit hybrid housing in designated areas while still allowing it elsewhere. The bill also includes exemptions for builders and developers, allowing them to construct and sell new homes without restrictions as long as the properties are unoccupied and intended for sale.

Title: Federal workers have to make their decisions on buyout offers today

Time Published: 2025-02-06T12:31:08Z

Happy almost Friday! Google's reversal of its promise not to use AI for weapons or surveillance led some employees to run to their meme generators. "Are we the baddies?" In today's big story, it's the last day for federal workers to decide if they want to accept President Donald Trump's buyout offers. What's on deck Markets: Citi shows no signs of joining Wall Street's RTO trend. Tech: Silicon Valley's new favorite buzzy term is "high agency." Business: Some burned-out doctors are ditching the operating room for the board room. But first, are you in or are you out? If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. It's a critical day for one of the most ambitious and unprecedented ways President Donald Trump is shaking up the federal workforce. Today marks the deadline for millions of government workers to accept the new administration's deferred resignation offer. BI's Ayelet Sheffey and Juliana Kaplan spoke to some workers mulling their options and grappling with questions about how the buyouts will actually work. Chief among their concerns are the impact the offer will have on retirement plans, how it will be affected by a potential government shutdown, and why they can't get more time to decide. Trump's buyout offer isn't completely unheard of. In fact, it looks pretty similar to Elon Musk's 2022 takeover of X. The key difference is that the public sector is known for its job stability, which may be why the offer is causing so much drama among its workers. The other elephant in the room is what'll happen if not enough workers resign. The government is aiming for 5-10% of its more than two million workers to take the deal. As of Tuesday, more than 20,000 workers had taken buyouts, but the Office of Personnel Management told BI it expected a large spike in the final runup to the deadline. The Department of Government Efficiency is staying busy in the meantime. The US Agency for International Development is Trump and Musk's latest cost-cutting target. The agency's staff was notified earlier this week that all personnel except for a few essential workers would be placed on administrative leave on Friday. BI's Noah Sheidlower has a breakdown on how the foreign aid agency, which distributed nearly $32.5 billion last year, spends its money. Speaking of money, the group that controls government payments — the Treasury Department — is also in Musk's crosshairs. President Trump gave Musk's DOGE access to the government's payment system, which caused quite the stir. The White House has maintained DOGE is limited to "read-only access" and its work on the Treasury plays into DOGE's overall mission of reducing government waste. But that hasn't eased concerns over the potential impact on a system that manages trillions in payments, including Social Security and tax refunds. It's the latest example of the incredible power the world's richest man appears to hold within the US government. House Speaker Mike Johnson isn't worried, though. He defended DOGE's role and said there is a "gross overreaction in the media" over how Musk is trying to cut spending. Jamie Dimon says he didn't run for president because he knew winning the White House would mean barely seeing his family for four years. 1. Palantir stock is on a hot streak, but Wall Street's not biting. Palantir stock surged 28% after it reported a strong Q4 earnings beat, putting it up almost 35% this year. Even so, few analysts are bullish on it. They're concerned about Palantir's high valuation and skeptical it can grow enough to maintain its current stock price. 2. Working for Citi doesn't mean having to go into the city. Wall Street titans are leading the charge with RTO mandates — except Citigroup. On a quarterly call with executives last month, CEO Jane Fraser emphasized hybrid work and mentioned it could give the bank a competitive edge when it comes to recruitment. Regardless, the company is still shelling out $1.2 billion for its new London office. 3. The advisor behind BlackRock's alternative assets expansion. Bob Steel, vice chair of boutique investment bank Perella Weinberg, has a laundry list of career achievements: two-time bank CEO, Goldman partner, and US Treasury undersecretary. More recently, Steel gave longtime friend Larry Fink some advice on BlackRock breaking into alternative investments. In a chat with BI, Steel explained his process with Fink and shared some wisdom for up-and-coming bankers. 1. Broke: "disruptor." Woke: "high agency." Silicon Valley has a new buzzword to describe the successful, smart, and self-motivated. It's called "high agency," and it's everyone's favorite new label. 2. It's not "RIP Temu and Shein" anymore. The two retailers disrupted the e-commerce industry by avoiding paying duty on shipments through a provision of customs law called Section 321, also known as de minimis. Many thought Trump's recent executive order closing that loophole would be a death knell for the companies. Temu and Shein will suffer a blow — but it might not be as bad as many initially thought. And if you recently placed an order, it should be fine. 3. DeepSeek's low-cost AI revolution isn't here … yet. When it burst onto the scene with its cheaper-to-build and cheaper-to-run models, DeepSeek was expected by some to revolutionize the entire AI startup system. That hasn't happened yet. Cloud providers are having trouble offering customers access to DeepSeek at fast and reliable speeds, slowing down the big switch to low-cost AI that startups had hoped for. 1. Doctors facing burnout may ditch the stethoscope. Tech companies are looking to bolster their credibility, especially with health innovation, and doctors are pitching in. Chief medical officers make $275,000 a year on average in the US — and don't have the crazy hours doctors normally deal with. Some say these corporate roles let them have a bigger impact on an otherwise "broken" health system, even amid a looming physician shortage. 2. Disney's game plan, in Iger's words. The company's sports streaming moves have been a roller coaster ride full of similar-sounding names — Venu and Fubo and Hulu, oh my! The abundance of options makes it difficult for consumers to understand Disney's sports strategy, a point an analyst raised on the company's earnings call. CEO Bob Iger clarified the goal is to make ESPN "as accessible as possible" and gave a little more insight in response. 3. "Moneyball" author Michael Lewis thinks the sports betting boom could become a mess. In 2018, gambling and media companies approached sports betting with caution. Today, gambling apps are met with little resistance, and college-aged men are getting in on the action. BI's Peter Kafka spoke with Lewis about how sports betting went mainstream — and what the fallout could be. 100,000 eggs were stolen from a supplier in Pennsylvania amid rising prices.

Title: US Bitcoin Reserve Will Lead To ‘Pain In Under 2 Years,’ Warns Arthur Hayes
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/us-strategic-bitcoin-reserve-terrible-idea-arthur-hayes/
Time Published: 2025-02-06T11:00:41Z
Full Content:
In his latest essay entitled “The Genie,” crypto entrepreneur and former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes denounced calls for a United States Bitcoin Strategic Reserve (BSR), warning that such a program would create “unnecessary pain in under two years” and transform the world’s largest cryptocurrency into a potent political weapon. Hayes also cautioned the industry against pursuing what he deems to be an overcomplicated “Frankenstein crypto regulatory bill,” which, he argues, would primarily benefit large centralized institutions rather than foster true decentralization. Hayes questions both the feasibility and the long-term consequences of establishing a national Bitcoin stockpile. He argues the US government would be motivated by politics rather than sound financial strategy, potentially leading to manipulation of the Bitcoin market. In his view, a BSR risks becoming a mechanism for politicians to raise funds for unrelated agendas: “Let’s assume that Trump is able to create a BSR. The government buys one million Bitcoin, as suggested by US Senator Lummis. Boom! The price goes nuts. Then, the buying concludes, and the up-only trend channel stops.” Hayes envisions a subsequent administration—one hostile to Bitcoin or crypto in general—deciding to liquidate this enormous reserve. “What if [the Democrats] got a veto-proof majority in the House of Representatives? By 2028, what if a Democrat won the election … finding easy piles of cash to spend on goodies for their supporters is the first directive. There are one million Bitcoin just sitting there, ready to be sold… The market would rightly fear when and how these Bitcoin would be sold.” Another of Hayes’ key contentions is that regulation shaped by special interests could inadvertently stifle the very innovation it aims to promote. According to Hayes, large exchanges and financial intermediaries with the resources to influence lawmakers are more likely to drive regulatory outcomes. This, he suggests, will burden smaller innovators and strengthen the position of major centralized players: “The crypto regulatory wishes likely to be granted… will be in the form of overly complicated, prescriptive rules that only large and wealthy centralized companies can afford… Is that what the broader crypto community actually desired from the genie? … Maybe those readers who are shareholders of Coinbase and BlackRock want a Frankenstein crypto bill. But I believe this type of regulation does nothing to alter the status quo.” Rather than a BSR, Hayes proposes a more radical and complex financial arrangement involving the US Treasury, Bitcoin, and “century bonds” (100-year zero-coupon bonds). His idea is for the US to unilaterally devalue its existing Treasury obligations by announcing that Bitcoin will replace sovereign debt as the neutral global reserve asset. The plan, in his own words, would involve a public statement from US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, declaring the intention to use Bitcoin as the reserve asset while retaining the US dollar as the invoicing currency. Afterward, the Dollar would undergo a progressive devaluation, with the US Treasury bidding for Bitcoin at increasingly higher prices while issuing century bonds instead of immediate cash payouts. The next step would be extending the maturity of Treasury debt, with the Treasury selling Bitcoin at a profit to buy back and retire shorter-term obligations, ultimately pushing US debt maturity to 100 years. Additionally, global USD adoption would be accelerated through stablecoin transfers on social media platforms like Facebook and X, enabling everyday users to participate in US bond markets—bypassing conventional banking intermediaries. “That’s it for the financial history… The additional new goal is to make Bitcoin the global neutral reserve currency,” Hayes explains. He believes such a strategy could restore US hegemony by transitioning from the traditional “petrodollar” or “Treasury-based” system to one anchored in Bitcoin, all while ensuring large swaths of Bitcoin’s mining operations remain within US borders. In a more cautionary afterword, Hayes highlights that crypto voters played a notable role in returning Donald Trump and the Republican Party to power. Yet he stresses the slow pace of action on crypto issues, contrasting it with the administration’s rapid implementation of tariffs and rollbacks of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) mandates. “When Trump wants to act, he acts… The removal of ESG and DEI policies… came swiftly… That’s a shame because on the margin, the crypto single-issue voter put [the Republicans] in power.” He also reiterates his forecast that Bitcoin could see a sharp correction to a range of $70,000 to $75,000 before rallying higher in the long-term —if there is no immediate, concrete legislation favoring permissionless innovation or further monetary stimulus. For now, Hayes urges those “lining up day after day dressed in a seersucker suit or block heels and a summer dress hoping to ask the orange genie for a wish” to think carefully: “Stacking sats is my game, and I hope yours is too. Therefore, if you find yourself at the genie’s table… please wish for the right things.” At press time, BTC traded at $98,190.

Title: BlackRock plans to launch a Bitcoin ETP in Europe

Time Published: 2025-02-06T10:49:48Z

BlackRock Inc., the world’s largest asset manager, is gearing up to launch a Bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP) in Europe. The step marks another significant step in the firm’s expansion into the cryptocurrency market and is set to be registered in Switzerland. This move follows the resounding success of BlackRock’s $58 billion US Bitcoin ETF, which by early February 2025 had gathered $57.5 billion in net assets. This alone speaks volumes about the investor appetite for such products. CEO Larry Fink’s remarks at the World Economic Forum in Davos highlighted Bitcoin’s potential as a hedge against currency debasement, suggesting a broader acceptance of cryptocurrencies as an alternative store of value. This European venture is anticipated to attract both institutional and retail investors looking for exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of direct cryptocurrency ownership. The decision to domicile the ETP in Switzerland was strategic, leveraging the country’s reputation as a hub for digital asset innovation, particularly within its “Crypto Valley” in Zug. Switzerland’s progressive regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies has made it an attractive location for BlackRock to extend its Bitcoin investment offerings beyond North American borders. The choice of Switzerland not only aligns with BlackRock’s aim to capitalize on crypto-friendly regulations, but also positions the firm to lead in the European market. Notably, the plans to launch an ETP in Europe comes at a time when the European Union is navigating its own regulatory path through the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, which was established in 2023. The MiCA framework aims to ensure consumer protection and market integrity, providing a stable environment for crypto investments. Despite the European crypto market capitalizing at $17.3 billion — far less than the US’s $116.4 billion — BlackRock’s move could significantly boost the sector. BlackRock’s entry into this market underscores the growing institutional acceptance of cryptocurrencies, a trend that has been further propelled by the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval of Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024.

Photo Credit: Bloomberg BlackRock's IBIT has grown rapidly, amassing net assets of $57.5 billion as of February 4 BlackRock is gearing up to launch a bitcoin exchange-traded product in Europe within weeks, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters, amid growing demand for exposure to cryptocurrencies from both money managers and consumers. The product will likely be domiciled in Switzerland, the source added. The Wall Street giant has incorporated a Zurich-based company focused on digital assets - iShares Digital Assets AG - in recent months, according to a regulatory filing seen by Reuters. BlackRock declined to comment. BlackRock was one of the first institutional investors to offer exchange-traded products to track the spot price of bitcoin after the US Securities and Exchange Commission first approved them in January 2024. The SEC's move was a watershed moment for the asset class, boosting hopes in the crypto industry that cryptocurrencies would become more widely integrated in mainstream finance. BlackRock's main bitcoin-linked product IBIT has grown rapidly, amassing net assets of $57.5 billion (roughly Rs. 5,03,523 crore) as of February 4, according to BlackRock's website. However, not all global investors can access the existing US-domiciled products. Bloomberg was first to report on BlackRock's plans in Europe. While the US crypto industry has celebrated Trump's election and his pledge to support the sector, crypto businesses in Europe are facing new, tougher regulation. The European Union's landmark crypto regulatory framework, known as the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) was introduced in early 2023 and is in the process of being rolled out. © Thomson Reuters 2025 (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

Title: Most Promising Altcoins to Buy as First Avalance and Cardano ETPs Appear

Time Published: 2025-02-06T09:16:44Z

Swedish asset manager Virtune launched Avalanche ($AVAX) and Cardano ($ADA) exchange-traded products (ETPs) on the Finnish market. Previously, Virtue rolled out $BTC, $SOL, and XRP ETPs, as well as the Crypto Altcoin Index ETP, which gives exposure to the top 10 cryptos at once. The demand for crypto among European investors is evidently growing, which suggests the bull run is far from over. Virtue’s ETPs could push $AVAX and $ADA to new heights due to accelerated adoption and set a precedent for other fund managers to launch altcoin products. In light of this news, we share the five most promising altcoins to buy now. The market cap of Solana ecosystem tokens grew 120% last month alone. That’s a double-edged sword because Solana isn’t ready to handle such a surge in activity. Solaxy ($SOLX) could help Solana handle this ever-increasing workload by offloading part of transactions to its Layer-2 chain. In fact, this is the first hybrid Layer-2 solution that connected Solana with Ethereum. Solaxy’s goal is to speed up processing, lower fees, and eliminate congestion on the Solana mainnet. This would allow more projects to launch on Solana without compromising user experience. The project’s native token, $SOLX, is now available on presale at $0.001626, but the price will increase in 23 hours. Early adopters have invested $18.2M so far and staked 5B tokens at a 222% APY. Autonomous agents are a new wave of AI evolution. Unlike bots that only follow pre-programmed instructions, AI agents can make decisions, solve problems, and learn independently. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) blends this next-gen technology with the viral appeal of Pepe the Frog. As a self-sovereign agent, MIND of Pepe analyzes data from crypto aggregators and social media to gauge market trends and sentiment. As a result, MIND of Pepe can deliver unbiased, real-time trading insights to its community, engage in discussions with other users, and launch its own tokens. $MIND token holders will gain exclusive access to the agent’s knowledge and governance rights. With one token worth $0.0032662, now is the best time to join the community. Analysts expect $MIND to explode after major exchanges confirm its listings, so the first adopters are up for the highest returns. Best Wallet is the fastest-growing crypto wallet ecosystem currently on the market, rapidly approaching its goal of capturing 40% of the market by 2026. This non-custodial hit wallet lets you store (obviously), buy, sell, swap, and stake assets across several blockchains. But its standout feature is the Token Launchpad, which gives access to all of the best presales from one app. The $BEST token presale hit the ground running recently and already generated $9.2M in funding, most of which will go toward the platform’s improvement. With a price of $0.023875, set to increase in 13 hours, there will be no better time to secure your share of tokens than now. Litecoin ($LTC) struggled to reach its former highs in 2024, but 2025 might be different. The main catalyst for its anticipated growth is new $LTC ETPs in the US and European markets. US asset manager Canary Capital recently filed an application for an $LTC ETF. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) fast-tracked it through the first stage of the review process, so it might launch in spring. $LTC is also part of Virtune’s Crypto Altcoin Index ETP because it meets the strict criteria of the Nasdaq Crypto Index Europe index. Uniswap is the world’s largest decentralized exchange (DEX) with an over $2T cumulative trading volume. Its native token, $UNI, is also featured in Virtune’s Crypto Altcoin Index ETP and has a $5.6B market cap. $UNI is now trading -79.24% below its all-time high of $44.97 recorded in 2021. Yet, institutional capital inflows from products like Virtune’s ETP might revive the token and the entire Uniswap ecosystem. While Hyperliquid ($HYPE) recently surpassed $UNI by market cap, the platform’s developments and institutional interest might drive it to new heights. The launch of altcoin ETPs attracts institutional capital into their respective ecosystems and the crypto industry as a whole. In the long term, this should drive innovation and increase crypto’s legitimacy in the eyes of the public. This confidence trickles down to presales like Solaxy and Best Wallet Token, which can attract a wider pool of investors, including those previously hesitant to participate in early-stage projects. However, remember to DYOR before investing in any cryptocurrency. Even projects with strong fundamentals don’t guarantee returns. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Meet Bob Steel, the Perella investment banker and former Treasury undersecretary who is advising Larry Fink on his alternative investment buying spree
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/robert-steel-perella-weinberg-investment-banker-advising-blackrock-fink-alternatives-2025-2
Time Published: 2025-02-06T09:15:01Z
Full Content:
Robert Steel has had the kind of career most people on Wall Street only dream about. He spent 30 years at powerhouse investment bank Goldman Sachs, where he rose to partner before "retiring" in 2004. In 2006, he became undersecretary of the US Treasury under President George W. Bush and helped prepare the government's response to what became the biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression. He stepped in as CEO of troubled bank Wachovia during the darkest days of that crisis and later served as Deputy Mayor for economic development of New York City under Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Since 2014, Steel has helped lead boutique investment bank Perella Weinberg, first as CEO and now as vice chairman. Last year, he helped the firm score a role as a top advisor to BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, in its expansion into alternative assets. Specifically, Steel worked with longtime friend Larry Fink on two recent acquisitions tied to BlackRock's expansion into investments traditionally reserved for the uberwealthy: Its $12.5 billion purchase of private-equity firm Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) and its $12 billion purchase of private-credit giant HPS Investment Partners (HPS). Steel said BlackRock's latest acquisitions were driven by its leadership's conviction that time was of the essence. "I think the BlackRock people had what I would describe as a pretty courageous point of view that the opportunity was, for now, significant," he said, adding: "So they'd rather not take the time to build. They'd rather buy and be a strong participant right away." The spate of deals, including a $3.2-billion acquisition of data provider Preqin, has led some on Wall Street to describe Blackrock's ambitions as potentially game-changing. Marc Rowan, the CEO of private-equity giant Apollo Global Management, recently pointed to the deals as evidence of a new investment paradigm that will meld the realms of publicly traded stocks and bonds with so-called private investments. "Our industry grew up where I think people thought private was risky and public was safe," Rowan said on a quarterly earnings call. BlackRock, he added, "has delivered a wakeup call to their entire peer set that private is going to be an important part of client solutions going forward." Business Insider sat down with Steel to talk about his long and storied career, his recent work helping BlackRock expand into alternative assets, his advice to the next generation of bankers, and why retirement is not on his to-do list. Steel and Larry Fink, BlackRock's founder and CEO, have been friends for about 20 years. They first got to know each other around 2006, Steel said, while he was Treasury undersecretary in Washington. They've supported some of the same causes over the years, including as cosigners of a public letter in support of Mayor Adams' public safety and crime reduction efforts in 2022. They're also both on the executive committee of the Partnership for New York City, a nonprofit that seeks to maintain the city's position as an economic and cultural hub. Steel said he got involved in Blackrock's expansion when Fink invited him and his team to assist with a non-alts project that "didn't come to fruition," without saying what it was. Steel and Perella soon became part of the team Fink relied on for advice about expanding into alternative assets. "When he was thinking about people to help with these transactions and give him advice, he thought of me and our firm," Steel said. Given Steel's long history with Wall Street, he ended up knowing people on both sides of the transactions. HPS was co-founded by Scott Kapnick, Goldman Sachs' former head of investment banking, while GIP's chairman, Adebayo Ogunlesi, was previously a Goldman board member. "This was a case where I knew the people in BlackRock, I knew the people at GIP, and I knew the people at HPS," he told BI. "So I was involved intensely all the way through." In describing his role in the deals, he said: "I wasn't writing documents and arguing with lawyers, but I was basically trying to provide momentum to the transaction and to understand the pros and cons and the challenges. And I think I was pretty central to that." A BlackRock spokesman confirmed Perella's role in the HPS and GIP acquisitions and declined to comment on whether the firm plans to buy more companies in a space that Fink has called "critical" to the firm's growth. "Private market assets are an increasingly vital part of capital markets," Fink said in the company's fourth-quarter earnings call in January. "And blending both public and private markets will be critical to fully capturing growth opportunities." Steel said he came from "a very middle-class background" in Durham, North Carolina, with no connections to Wall Street. As a student at nearby Duke University, he had little interest in finance. "I steered away from math and science and quantitative things in undergraduate school," said Steel, who majored in history and political science. Eventually, that changed. He started in institutional sales at Goldman Sachs in 1976 (and remedied his quantitative knowledge by enrolling in the University of Chicago's nighttime MBA program a few years later). Ever since, Steel said, the biggest theme of his career has been collaboration and teamwork. He pointed to the late 1980s, when he and his team at Goldman launched an ECM division in Europe, as an example. "The idea of setting strategy for equities and then finding the right people to help lead and execute that was pretty extraordinary," he said. "Goldman Sachs was not very well known in the continent, and we built businesses and built a brand, and I think were pretty successful." Steel was soon made a Goldman partner, and about six years later, he moved back to New York to co-lead the US Equities Division. "I was lucky enough to be in a place where the firm was growing and creating new opportunities where I don't think I had one job for 30 years — I think I had half a dozen jobs for five years," he said. While Goldman taught Steel teamwork, Washington DC taught him about working under fire. "You're doing a lot of things for the first time and you don't really know what's going to work, what's not going to work," he said. "So trying to figure that out so you can hopefully prevent something like a mean-spirited recession is a lot of responsibility, and so that was a pretty challenging time." Moving from the private to the public sector also required adjustments in other ways. He explained that authority in the corporate world is clearly assigned, ending with the CEO. In government, authority is shared due to checks and balances. "When you're solving the same puzzles in the public sector, that success generally comes more slowly and takes more time and often requires a bit of compromise — different than the corporate world," he said. Steel was CEO of Perella between 2014 and 2019, and the firm worked on some notable transactions during that time, including AT&T's $108.7 billion purchase of Time Warner in 2016 and iHeartMedia's $16 billion bankruptcy restructuring in 2019. As vice chairman, Steel is part of Perella's board of directors and helps with the strategic direction of the firm along with Chairman Peter Weinberg, a founding partner, and Andrew Bednar, who took over the CEO role from Weinberg in 2023. Although Steel, 73, has certainly earned the right to retire, he told BI he has zero interest in spending his days on a golf course or lounging at a beach. "I'll take time away over the holidays, but the idea of doing nothing seems pretty uninteresting," he said. "I think the goal is to wear out, not rust out." "I have friends that are really happy at a different rhythm, and I have no judgments," he said. "But it wouldn't be for me." Steel, however, appreciates the flexibility the pandemic has introduced to the corporate world, including banking. Early on in his career, he said, the pressure behind constant face time was, at times, overkill. "I think 'presentism' is maybe a bit overvalued. That doesn't mean you shouldn't be focused, committed, and available, but the idea that every day I had to be in before my boss and stay until after he left," he said, "I think that's moderated a bit, which I think is a good thing." His main advice to young people is to become an integral and irreplaceable part of your company or team. He said you must think beyond the day-to-day tasks to get there. "Thinking about how what you're doing fits into a bigger picture and understanding that perspective is a good tool," he said. Jump to

Title: Ruchii restaurant review: This neighbourhood Indian spot has the potential to become a foodie destination

I love a thali – tiny copper pots gleaming like a miniature banquet, each promising its own little world of flavour. But before I even get to order it at Ruchii, crisp poppadoms land on the table, accompanied by a green apple chutney – light, tart and clean – and a strawberry chutney that tastes unmistakably of the fruit itself. Both are made in-house, arriving as I’m still surveying the menu. Ruchii sits just off George’s Avenue in Blackrock, having relocated from its former perch above Conway’s pub. It’s now in a bigger space with a wilfully expansive menu and just enough gloss to remind you that its owners, Murali and Sateesh Sayana, have a clear vision for elevating Indian cuisine. The menu roams the subcontinent like a train on the Indian Railways: butter chicken and rogan josh from the north, dosas from the south, and the fiery Chettinad spice blends from Tamil Nadu rattling through the lot. This kind of range and variety could spell trouble for the kitchen, but it turns out to be no issue for the team of four Indian chefs, led by chef-patron Sateesh. Growing up in his father’s restaurant in Andhra Pradesh, Sateesh learned to mix idli and dosa batter as a child. Following professional stints in Jaipur and Agra, he moved to Dublin in 2002 to cook in Rasam, and has laid on feasts for everyone from the Indian prime minister to Cher. The soft-shell crab (€13.50) is a tasty starter, lightly battered and fried to a golden crunch. It is accompanied with chutneys and curry leaf mayonnaise, firmly anchoring it in the south Indian coastal tradition. The cocktails, however, are a little less precise. A margarita (€10.95) is overly sweet, missing that all-important sour-salty snap that keeps you coming back for another sip. Drinkable, yes, but not the cocktail you’d want paired with food this vibrant. Stick to beer or wine. The well-considered list focuses on aromatic, full-bodied options with enough weight for the dishes, though I remain unconvinced that wine is the ideal match for Indian food. The fish curry (€22.50) features large, fresh chunks of cod cloaked in ginger, garlic, mustard seed and that floral hit of pathar ke phool, all luxuriating in a creamy coconut sauce. We’ve paired it with pilau rice (€3), fragrant with rosewater and topped with fried onions, alongside wonderful garlic naan – hot from the tandoor, steaming and lavishly slathered in ghee. [ Firebyrd takeaway review: Nashville fried chicken rules the roost at this D6 restaurantOpens in new window ] Then comes the thali (€33), the main event, a copper tray bristling with little pots arranged in perfect order. Inspired by the six primary tastes of Indian culinary tradition – salt, sour, sweet, bitter, astringent and pungent – it’s as much a lesson in balance as it is a meal. Salty richness is found in the dal Makhani. It is made from urad lentils and is less buttery than you may find elsewhere, but is slow-cooked to bring an earthy depth. The creamy tomato sauce in the butter chicken brings a delicate sweetness in a base so velvety you could wear it, while the tender lamb pieces in the rogan josh hum with the pungency of toasted fennel and the warmth of cardamom. The spinach, which is rich and creamy, is cooked with fenugreek to bring a subtle bitterness to the dish; and the prawns, in a coconut-based sauce, get a touch of sourness from tamarind and raw mango. It’s one of those sauces you find yourself finishing long after the prawns are gone, wishing there were more as it lingers on the palate, allowing the spicy heat to build. A brightly coloured beetroot raita is subtly sweet and refreshing. Dessert is a lentil doughnut drowning in jaggery syrup, unapologetically sweet and defiantly sticky. It’s exactly the type of ending you’d expect from an Indian meal – traditional and indulgent. Ruchii’s menu reflects India’s culinary diversity, with its extensive selection offering something for everyone. It’s a mix of the comforting and the challenging, the traditional and the experimental. For a suburban spot, it punches above its weight – a bold attempt to cram the breadth of Indian cuisine into a single menu. It’s also an invitation: to explore, to taste and to learn about the rich histories and traditions that shape each dish. With thoughtful execution, such a menu has the potential to elevate this neighbourhood spot into a genuine destination for Indian food enthusiasts. I, for one, will be back to explore more. Dinner for two with a cocktail and two beers was €99.95. The verdict An extensive menu of tasty Indian dishes. Food provenance Irish Country Meats, Gahan Meats, Keelings and Kish Fish. Vegetarian options Palak kofta, Kadai paneer, dal, baby aubergines in a curry sauce, and thali. Wheelchair access Fully accessible with an accessible toilet. Music Bollywood music in the background.

Title: What 2025 Has in Store For The Future of ESG

Once a corporate imperative, the ESG movement is now facing mounting backlash, forcing companies and investors to rethink their approach. What is the future of ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance)? The global craze of companies, countries, investors and regulators wanting to achieve sustainability goals based on environmental, social and governance benchmarks is now facing strong headwinds. Despite clear evidence that the world faces growing threats from climate change, rising social inequality and shaky governance, many of the actors that had been strong advocates for ESG are retreating from their stated aims. Consider these recent developments: First, The US has (once again) withdrawn from the Paris Agreement, leading other major countries such as Indonesia to doubt the credibility of the climate targets set in Paris. Then there is growing pushback from major companies in the EU around the EU ESG Taxonomy, saying it makes them globally uncompetitive and raises their cost of capital. More and more companies are scaling back or abandoning their ESG targets as they realise it is either too unrealistic, too expensive or politically unwise to stay the course. ESG funds, long the darling of investors, have underperformed in investment returns compared to non-ESG funds in recent years and also saw an outflow of funds; Blackrock, the “cheerleader“ for the ESG investing movement, has walked away from a number of its ESG ambitions. DEI programs in rich, mainly Western countries are coming under fire and many such initiatives are being phased out. So, is the ESG movement over? Not really. ESG will continue to evolve in new ways despite these headwinds. In fact, in some ways these current developments could help usher in a newer, better form of ESG: call it ESG 2.0. What would ESG 2.0 look like? Here are some likely scenarios: First, companies will continue to make investments in ESG but will measure tangible financial returns before they make these investments; these returns will include calculating the reduction in cost of funding (especially in developing countries), monetising decarbonisation efforts through carbon credits, achieving lasting operating cost reductions, and so on. Next, regulators will shift the emphasis away from “compliance” based ESG, ie submitting reports, to “enforcement“ based ESG where bad actors will face sanctions in the form of higher taxes, fines or loss of licenses. All investors, regardless of whether they have an explicit ESG focus, will integrate ESG considerations into their investment decisions but will do so by factoring in climate, social and other externalities that directly impact the value of their investment. Then you have new stakeholder alliances involving NGOs, the media, the legal profession, and ordinary citizens will harness the power of AI and the information revolution to mount more targeted campaigns against companies that are bad actors. In many ways, all these scenarios are already playing out. Climate lawsuits led by stakeholders against fossil fuel companies are happening with more frequency than ever in various courtrooms around the world. More and more governments are implementing carbon and other natural resource taxes. More and more “green transition“ funds are available to governments and companies for developing countries under the COP framework that are committed to meeting these goals. Investors are nervous about “climate-related bankruptcies” like Pacific Gas & Electric and are actively investing in tools to quantify such risks. Welcome to the new world of ESG, against a daunting backdrop of a burning world! Let’s hope it succeeds this time! Ravi Chidambaram is the founder & CEO of RIMM Sustainability, a Singapore-based global provider of ESG software solutions for enterprises. He has many years of experience as an entrepreneur, lecturer and thought leader in both the corporate finance and sustainability field as founder of TC Capital, Adjunct Professor at Yale NUS College and RIMM.

Title: BlackRock Set To Launch Bitcoin-Linked ETF In Europe Following US Success

Time Published: 2025-02-06T02:00:31Z

In a significant development for the Bitcoin (BTC) market, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is preparing to introduce an exchange-traded Fund (ETF) directly tied to BTC in Europe. This move follows the success of its $58 billion US ETF that tracks the market’s leading cryptocurrency, underscoring BlackRock’s commitment to expanding its footprint in the digital asset space. According to Bloomberg, the new fund is expected to be domiciled in Switzerland. BlackRock could begin marketing the fund as soon as this month, marking a pivotal moment in the firm’s venture into European cryptocurrency products. While ETFs linked to cryptocurrencies have been available on European exchanges for several years, this will be BlackRock’s first crypto-linked ETF outside of North America. As a leader in the issuance of exchange-traded funds, BlackRock manages over $4.4 trillion in assets across various products. The firm has emerged as a prominent supporter of the digital asset class, with CEO Larry Fink recently highlighting Bitcoin’s potential as a hedge against currency debasement during the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos. The launch of several US ETFs tied to Bitcoin last year ignited substantial demand for the asset class, leading to an influx of $116 billion across 12 funds to date, according to Bloomberg data. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (ticker IBIT) has notably set industry records, boasting the highest-performing debut of any Exchange-Traded Fund in history. The cryptocurrency market has experienced a significant rally since the election of US President Donald Trump, with Bitcoin reaching a record high of $109,241 in January. The increasing interest from financial institutions is fueled by Trump’s vocal support for the industry and the promise of forthcoming regulations that could provide clearer guidelines for firms navigating the crypto landscape. New regulations for cryptocurrencies also went into effect in the European Union (EU) in late December 2024, further encouraging institutional participation. Despite the competitive landscape, with over 160 cryptocurrency ETPs currently available in Europe tracking Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH), and other tokens, the overall market size of $17.3 billion remains modest compared to the robust US market. In a recent blog post, BlackRock executives Samara Cohen and Jay Jacobs noted that the combination of gaining Bitcoin exposure through the ETF wrapper has proven to be an appealing option for investors. At the time of writing, the market’s leading cryptocurrency has fallen to the $96,770 mark, losing the key $100,000 level after experiencing a 7% price drop over the weekly time frame.

Asset management titan BlackRock is reportedly going to list a new spot market Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded product (ETP) in Europe, its first digital asset-related venture into the continent. According to a new report from Bloomberg, BlackRock – which has over $10 trillion in assets under management – is getting ready to launch a BTC ETP in Europe after its US iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) was a massive success. Anonymous people familiar with the matter say that the ETP will be based out of Switzerland and that BlackRock could start advertising the fund as soon as sometime this month. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and ETPs allow traders to expose themselves to assets – such as precious metals and crypto – without having to actually physically purchase them. BlackRock first launched IBIT in January 2024 after years of having its bid delayed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Previously, Bloomberg found that IBIT had the best debut out of all other US BTC ETFs. At the time, it was found that IBIT held more assets than BlackRock’s Gold ETF despite it being launched nearly two decades earlier in 2005. According to BlackRock’s official website, the net assets of IBIT are $57.4 billion while Bloomberg reports that Europe’s total crypto ETP market is sized at around $17.3 billion. IBIT is trading for $56.09 at time of writing, a marginal decrease on the day while the top crypto asset by market cap is valued at $98,146.

Or Bitcoin and gold? Investors are weighing where to put their money in times of uncertainty—and no time is more uncertain than now. President Donald Trump’s tariffs—or threats of tariffs—have rocked markets, making “risk-on” assets like crypto less appealing. The price of gold hit a new high Monday, while Bitcoin dropped below $93,000, down about 14% from its all-time high price set on January 20. Bitcoin's correlation to the precious metal is down significantly as investors flock to more traditional safe haven assets, experts told Decrypt. Bitcoin proponents have long claimed that the cryptocurrency’s unique selling point is that it’s a long-term store of value—like gold. And sometimes, they are correlated: The two assets have moved in tandem in the past, when investors have flocked to a strong dollar. But things are up in the air now that President Donald Trump has taken office and issued a flurry of dramatic orders, and Bitcoin’s 90-day correlation with gold has remained close to zero, data provider Kaiko told Decrypt. Case in point: The new commander in chief implemented tariffs against Canada, Mexico, and China on Saturday, causing crypto prices to drop sharply. After having a “friendly conversation” with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum two days later, he decided to pause tariffs—leading to a rebound in Bitcoin’s price. Meanwhile, gold soared. Trump later agreed to a similar pause with Canada as the two countries attempt to work out a deal, while tariffs against China ultimately did go into effect. “The trade war could decouple the correlation in the short term as gold is a more established ‘safe haven’ asset, while Bitcoin—although often seen as a safe haven—is currently owned by a large investor base also trading highly speculative risk-asset meme coins and tech stocks,” Amberdata’s director of derivatives Greg Magadini told Decrypt. The reason for the decoupling is that Bitcoin is still performing less like a safe-haven and more like risk assets, such as tech stocks. The biggest cryptocurrency by market cap over the past seven days alone has swung from $105,893 per coin to as low as $92,876, CoinGecko shows. “While Bitcoin has indisputably drawn investors as a similarly alternative store of value, its higher volatility makes it less reliable in times of economic uncertainty compared to gold,” Michael Petch, co-founder and president of gold investment platform Argo, told Decrypt. Bitcoin as an asset is still finding its feet, say some (including Wall Street titan BlackRock), and even though its long-term gains by far outmatch gold, for now the 5,000-year old physical asset is still the go-to safe haven during times of chaos. “Investors don’t like uncertainty and Donald Trump brings a lot of uncertainty,” RIA Advisors portfolio manager Michael Lebowitz told Decrypt.

The shares of Kyndryl (KD) are advancing 6% after Scotiabank increased its price target on the tech name to $45 from $35. The cloud services company was spun off from IBM (IBM) in 2021. Why Scotiabank Is Bullish on KD The bank raised its price target on KD after it unveiled higher-than-expected fiscal third-quarter earnings per share and in-line fiscal Q3 sales on Monday. Scotiabank kept an Outperform rating on KD. A data analyst in a lab monitoring a cloud-based software system to detect cardiac disease. Scotiabank believes that Kyndryl's embrace of automation, artificial intelligence, and analytics has helped the firm increase its profit margins and create value for investors. The bank noted that KD's consulting business, driven by the rapid proliferation of AI and cloud security systems, is expanding by double-digit percentage levels. The latter unit's growth, in turn, is creating new opportunities for its Managed Services unit, according to Scotiabank.

The largest asset manager in the world is buying the Ethereum dip to custody funds for its ETH-based exchange-traded fund (ETF). According to BlackRock’s data, the firm picked up 100,535 ETH – worth about $276.2 million at time of writing – for its iShares ETHA product. BlackRock holds a total of 1,352,934 ETH worth roughly $3.71 billion, and the financial giant’s total assets under management were reported to be around $11.5 trillion in October of last year. And according to on-chain data, the President of the United States’ crypto project World Liberty Financial (WLFI) is also accumulating Ethereum, with blockchain “de-anonymizing” platform Arkham reporting that WLFI also purchased over $307 million worth of ETH and Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) and sent it to Coinbase Prime for management purposes. In a recent strategy session, crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe told his 768,800 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) could hit massive new all-time highs if the current bull market extends beyond what many are predicting. The analyst gave a price target of $20,000 for ETH. “I think that there’s a significant chance that this cycle will be longer and go higher than everybody expects. We’ve had the longest bear market on altcoins. Why not have the longest, final bull market on them? Bitcoin to $500,000 and Ethereum to $20,000.

The fund would be based on Switzerland, and is unlikely to be an IBIT wrapper. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock is preparing to introduce an exchange-traded product (ETP) linked to Bitcoin (BTC) in Europe, Bloomberg News reported on Feb. 5. According to sources familiar with the matter, the fund is expected to be domiciled in Switzerland, and BlackRock could begin marketing the product as early as this month. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said BlackRock could potentially launch the new ETP in a similar way it did in Canada. The Canadian ETP is a wrapper for IBIT, BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) available in the US. However, Seyffart noted that such a move would have a low chance of success in Europe. Seyffart highlighted that BlackRock Bitcoin ETPs in the US and Canada have fees of 25 basis points and 32 basis points (bps), respectively. Notably, European products already offer exposure to BTC through funds carrying a 25 bps fee. Eric Balchunas also showed interest in seeing the fees charged by BlackRock in Europe. He explained that the US is commonly the best in the rest of the world in terms of cost and liquidity. Balchunas added: “Either way shows commitment from world’s biggest asset manager who has big presence overseas.” The European market for crypto ETPs includes more than 160 products that track Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH), and other digital assets. The market’s cumulative value is $17.3 billion. Balchunas highlighted that the European crypto ETF landscape is “barely on [the] leaderboard,” as the US spot Bitcoin ETFs represent 91% of the global share. He assessed that BlackRock had a chance to succeed by bringing the “US Terrordome” to Europe. Yet, Balchunas noted that European investors, unlike US and Asian investors, have less appetite for riskier investment products. According to Farside Investors data, IBIT recorded $40.7 billion in net inflows as of Feb. 4. Its inflows are over three times larger than Fidelity’s FBTC, the second-largest spot Bitcoin ETF.

By Iain Withers LONDON (Reuters) - BlackRock is gearing up to launch a bitcoin exchange-traded product in Europe within weeks, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters, amid growing demand for exposure to cryptocurrencies from both money managers and consumers. The product will likely be domiciled in Switzerland, the source added. The Wall Street giant has incorporated a Zurich-based company focused on digital assets - iShares Digital Assets AG - in recent months, according to a regulatory filing seen by Reuters. BlackRock declined to comment. BlackRock was one of the first institutional investors to offer exchange-traded products to track the spot price of bitcoin after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission first approved them in January 2024. The SEC's move was a watershed moment for the asset class, boosting hopes in the crypto industry that cryptocurrencies would become more widely integrated in mainstream finance. BlackRock's main bitcoin-linked product IBIT has grown rapidly, amassing net assets of $57.5 billion as of Feb. 4, according to BlackRock's website. However, not all global investors can access the existing U.S.-domiciled products. Bloomberg was first to report on BlackRock's plans in Europe. While the U.S. crypto industry has celebrated Trump's election and his pledge to support the sector, crypto businesses in Europe are facing new, tougher regulation. The European Union's landmark crypto regulatory framework, known as the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) was introduced in early 2023 and is in the process of being rolled out.

Title: Blackrock Plans to Launch a Bitcoin ETP in Europe: Bloomberg

The world's largest asset management firm with more than $10 trillion in AUM, Blackrock (BLK) plans on listing a bitcoin exchange traded product (ETP) in Europe, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday. The fund would be based in Switzerland and BlackRock could start marketing it as soon as this month, according to the report. This would be the giant asset manager's first crypto-linked ETP outside of America. Blackrock's U.S.-based iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) has been a wild success, accumulating nearly $60 billion in assets in just more than one year since opening for business. BlackRock's move would be the latest in a string of investment firms looking to dive further into providing crypto-backed securities in Europe. Kraken recently secured a license that will enable it to offer derivatives, joining others like Bitstamp and FTX EU. The company's entry into the European crypto ETP ecosystem could further fuel the competitive response that’s been seen among various providers, which include fee waivers on several products, some expense fees for ETP's have been as high as 2.5%. In the U.S., a similar competitive response came after these funds were launched in Jan. 2024. A lot of question marks still occur around this product, including the fee structure, which would have big implications for the performance of the ETP. “Don't know the fee yet, that will be a big variable," said Senior Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas. "U.S. ETFs blow away the rest of the world in cost and liquidity but either way shows commitment from the world's biggest asset manager who has a big presence overseas." U.S.-based bitcoin ETFs currently have 91% of the world market, said Balchunas. Blackrock did not comment before press time. Camomile Shumba is a CoinDesk regulatory reporter based in the UK.

Title: BlackRock plans to launch Bitcoin ETP in Europe as soon as this month after US success

Hit your long-term targets. Earn up to 16% per year on digital assets. Share this article BlackRock is poised to expand its crypto product line with the launch of a Bitcoin ETP in Europe, capitalizing on the runaway success of its US-listed spot Bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), according to a Wednesday report from Bloomberg, citing sources with knowledge of the matter who requested anonymity due to the confidential nature of the plans. Projected to be based in Switzerland, the planned fund would be BlackRock’s first crypto ETP in the European market. The world’s leading asset manager, which previously focused on North America, launched the IBIT fund and subsequently introduced its iShares Bitcoin ETF on Cboe Canada. The new ETP may debut as soon as this month, sources said. BlackRock’s IBIT has become one of the largest Bitcoin ETFs since its launch last January, accumulating approximately $58 billion worth of Bitcoin as of February 4. The fund ranks as the 31st largest ETF globally across all categories, including traditional finance products, according to VettaFi. IBIT has led the spot Bitcoin ETF market with a five-day winning streak, attracting nearly $934 million in net inflows since January 30. Yesterday’s inflows alone totaled approximately $249 million, driving most of the spot Bitcoin ETF market’s gains, according to data from Farside Investors. The European crypto ETP market currently features more than 160 products tracking various digital assets, though its size remains smaller than the US market. The expansion comes as Bitcoin has reached new highs this year, amid increased regulatory clarity following the EU’s implementation of new crypto rules. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart initially speculated that BlackRock might consider replicating its Canadian Bitcoin ETF structure in Europe using a “wrapper” approach, where the ETF holds shares of its US-listed IBIT. However, he swiftly confirmed that this strategy is unlikely to be allowed under EU regulations. Sources told him that EU regulators are poised to reject such a workaround, likely requiring BlackRock to launch a standalone European Bitcoin ETF. This necessitates a different approach and puts the spotlight squarely on fees. “I have been informed that this is unlikely to be allowed in EU. So will be interesting to see what they charge assuming they launch a standalone product. In the US the total cost is 25 bps. Canada is 32 bps,” he wrote on X. “There’s already products at 25 bps and lower in Europe including Valour who has a zero expense ratio product.” Beyond regulatory hurdles and pricing pressures, BlackRock faces a more fundamental challenge: market size and investor appetite, Eric Balchunas, Seyffart’s fellow Bloomberg ETF analyst, shared in a comment. The US spot Bitcoin ETF market, despite being just a year old, has exploded in popularity, capturing a staggering 91% of global market share. Europe, by contrast, lags considerably. While European investors are sophisticated, they have historically shown less enthusiasm for the high-octane investment products that have resonated with US investors.

Title: Ondo launches blockchain platform to tokenize US stocks for global investors

Ondo GM will provide exposure to Apple, Tesla, SPDR, and more with stablecoin transactions. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Ondo Finance has introduced Ondo Global Markets (Ondo GM), a platform designed to bring real-world assets (RWAs) such as stocks, bonds, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) onto the blockchain. According to a Feb. 4 statement, this move provides global access to US securities by enabling investors outside the US to gain exposure through tokenized representations of these assets. It stated: “With Ondo GM, anyone outside the US in eligible geographies can get exposure to thousands of US securities—AAPL, TSLA, SPY, QQQ, etc.—with minimal fees using stablecoins, removing traditional cost and geographic barriers.” The company said that the token issued through Ondo GM maintains a 1:1 backing with its underlying security, ensuring legitimacy and transparency. It noted that these tokens function similarly to stablecoins, facilitating seamless transfers across blockchain networks beyond US borders. Ondo furthered that investors benefit from instant minting and redemption, enhanced liquidity, and built-in access to on-chain financial services, including lending, trading, and yield-generation opportunities. Ondo added: “Ondo GM will propel financial markets into the open economy, returning power to stakeholders to make their own decisions and compete on a level playing field, while addressing challenges like high fees, limited availability, and transfer frictions.” To support broader adoption, Ondo GM provides comprehensive APIs that enable brokers, asset issuers, and fintech platforms to integrate tokenized assets into their systems. Additionally, a legal framework ensures investor protection, safeguarding assets with a structured approach that minimizes risk. Ondo’s move comes as the RWA sector has experienced remarkable growth, reaching an all-time high of $16.88 billion in on-chain value. Data from RWA.xyz reveals a 94% increase over the past year, with nearly $4 billion added in the last three months alone. There are now 83,049 entities holding RWAs, collectively managing assets issued by 112 providers. Private credit leads the market with $11.6 billion in tokenized value, followed by US Treasury debt ($3.5 billion) and commodities ($1.1 billion). Institutional funds represent a smaller portion, valued at around $410 million. Meanwhile, Ethereum remains the dominant blockchain for RWAs, hosting 67 asset tokens, while zkSync (28) and Arbitrum (20) follow closely. The surge in RWA adoption aligns with growing interest from traditional financial institutions. Traditional financial institutions like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton have deepened their involvement in tokenized finance, signaling a shift toward blockchain-powered investment solutions.

Title: U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETF Inflows Surge 175% Year-Over-Year

Full Content:
U.S.-listed spot bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have seen a 175% year-over-year increase in almost the first three weeks of trading. In 2025, from Jan. 13 to Feb. 5, net inflows equaled $4.4 billion, while the 2024 net inflows for the first three weeks equaled $1.6 billion. The spot bitcoin ETFs were one of the most successful ETF launches of all time, and have accumulated over $40.6 billion in total net inflows. In the same time, BlackRock iShares Trust (IBIT) has seen a total of $40.7 billion in net inflows. While the total net inflow for all 11 spot BTC ETFs is $40.6 billion, due to Grayscale GBTC witnessing outflows of $21.9 billion. To determine whether these inflows reflect a directional long position or are part of a basis trade—where an investor goes long on the underlying asset in the spot market while simultaneously selling futures contracts when they trade at a premium to spot. Currently, investors can capture a premium of approximately 10%, which will eventually diminish as the spot price converges with the futures contract's expiry. According to Glassnode data, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), the primary venue for such trades, has seen a year-to-date decline in open interest from 180,099 BTC to 168,549 BTC, suggesting that these inflows are not primarily driven by basis trading.

Valerie Urbain, Chief Executive Officer of Euroclear, commented: "2024 was a year of record financial performance, underpinned by our increasingly diversified business model and driven by strong business income and sustained interest income. Our strategy and new management structure puts clients at the centre of our plans, and we continue to make progress against our key objectives. In 2024, we grew our funds business and European presence through the announced acquisition of Inversis in Spain. We also continue to support market adoption of digital assets by attracting new issuances on our D-SI platform while participating in important projects with industry partners to drive innovation across European post-trade. Our core activities continue to thrive. We have reached record levels in settlement and safekeeping activities, with assets under custody closing the year over the €40 trillion mark. The outstanding of Euroclear's Collateral Highway is now close to €2 trillion, while the funds depot also hit a new high of 3.6 trillion." Business performance The key operating metrics (end of period unless stated otherwise) demonstrate an excellent business performance during the period. FY 2023 FY 2024 YoY evolution 3-year CAGR Assets under custody €37.7 trillion €40.7 trillion +8 % +3 % Number of transactions 299 million 331 million +10 % +4 % Turnover €1,072 trillion €1,162 trillion +8 % +5 % Fund assets under custody €3.1 trillion €3.6 trillion +16 % +4 % Collateral Highway €1.67 trillion €1.9 trillion +15 % +1 % Underlying cash deposits (full year average) €23.7 billion €22.8 billion -4 % +3 % Euroclear's assets under custody reached a record €40.7 trillion, growing for the ninth quarter in a row, thanks to solid stock exchange performances and robust results in fixed income. Settlement volumes hit a new high due to sustained activity throughout the year. Boosted by the ETF activity, combined with the rise in equity markets, fund assets under custody reached the record level of €3.6 trillion. The Collateral Highway's outstanding continues to increase and is now close to its prior peak level. Business milestones Advancing the funds business Over the past years, Euroclear's funds offering has evolved rapidly thanks to acquisitions such as MFEX in 2021 and Goji in 2023. In 2024, major clients in Asia, Europe and the US, including Banque et Caisse d'Epargne de l'Etat Luxembourg (Spuerkeess), Blackrock, China Construction Bank (Asia), DBS Bank or ODDO BHF have selected Euroclear FundsPlace for the onboarding of their investment funds. Euroclear provides them with a one-stop-shop solution for fund distribution and execution services via its extensive network, allowing their clients to have access to more than 250,000 funds. In 2024, Euroclear acquired a strategic stake in IZNES, a pan-European funds marketplace based on blockchain technology. This partnership complements Euroclear's funds services in the French market and beyond as it continues to play an active role in the development of innovative funds distribution models. In July 2024, Euroclear announced the acquisition of a 49% stake in Inversis, a leading provider of global investment technology solutions and outsourced financial services with the intention to become the full owner of the Spanish company by end 2027. By acquiring Inversis, Euroclear aims to accelerate the delivery of its funds strategy and increase its pan-European coverage thanks to Inversis' significant presence on the Spanish market. In Asia, Euroclear acquired a strategic stake in Marketnode, a Singapore-based digital market infrastructure operator. By joining forces with Marketnode, Euroclear aims to participate in the setup of a key market infrastructure in Asia-Pacific designed to simplify the management of fund flows and reduce settlement times by using DLT technology. Reshaping traditional financial services Euroclear has an important role to play in bridging the gap between digital asset securities and the conventional financial landscape. In 2024, Euroclear made significant progress to become a digital, data-enabled Financial Market Infrastructure by welcoming the Digital Native Note (DNN) issued by the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank on its Digital Securities Issuance (D-SI) platform. This marks the first of such digital issuance in USD for Euroclear and the first by an Asia-based issuer on its platform. Euroclear is also actively engaged in exploring the full potential of digital assets and participates in various DLT projects with market partners. Alongside Digital Asset and The World Gold Council, it successfully completed a groundbreaking pilot to tokenise gold, Gilts and Eurobonds for collateral management. With the support of Paris Europlace, Euroclear worked with a group of French banks around its D-SI platform and Banque de France's DL3S platform for Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) to issue the first Digitally Native Note (DNN) under French law and settled it in CBDC. Streamlined management structure Following the appointment of Valérie Urbain as CEO of the group, Euroclear redesigned the structure and composition of its top management team to accelerate strategy execution. A new, expanded Executive Committee composed of eight members ensures the representation of all the group's constituents in all key strategic decisions and a stronger focus on clients, business operations and people – both in Europe and internationally. Launch of the Euroclear Foundation to amplify social impact Euroclear aims to make a significant positive social impact in the locations where it operates. By establishing the Euroclear Foundation, Euroclear will seek to improve lives and support the next generation by working to eliminate pressing social and environmental issues. The Euroclear Foundation builds on the company's existing initiatives aimed at increasing its social impact. These include a group-wide volunteering programme, long-term community partnerships and a Matching Gift programme to match employee donations. Russian sanctions impacts Financial impacts of the Russian assets Update on Russian sanctions and countermeasures Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 resulted in market-wide application of international sanctions. Euroclear considers the application of international sanctions as a key obligation. Therefore, well established processes are in place which have allowed the group to implement the sanctions while maintaining our normal course of business. As a result of the sanctions, blocked coupon payments and redemptions owed to sanctioned entities continue to accumulate on Euroclear Bank's balance sheet. At the end of December 2024, Euroclear Bank's balance sheet totalled €212 billion, of which €183 billion relate to sanctioned Russian assets. In line with Euroclear's risk appetite and policies and as expected by the EU Capital Requirements Regulation, Euroclear's cash balances are re-invested to minimise risk and capital requirements. In 2024, interest arising on cash balances from Russian-sanctioned assets was approximately €6.9 billion. Such interest earnings are driven by the prevailing interest rates and the amount of cash balances that Euroclear is required to invest. Subject to Belgian corporate tax, these earnings generated €1.7 billion tax revenue for the Belgian State. As such, future earnings will be influenced by the evolving interest rate environment. Effective 15 February 2024, the EU Council adopted a Regulation requiring Central Securities Depositories (CSDs) holding reserves and assets of the Central Bank of Russia with a total value of more than €1 million to apply specific rules in relation to the cash balances accumulating due to restrictive measures. These CSDs, such as Euroclear Bank, should account for and manage such extraordinary cash balances separately from their other activities, should keep separate the net profit generated and should not dispose of these ensuing net profits (e.g. in the form of dividends to shareholders). In May 2024, the European Commission has adopted a new regulation about a windfall contribution applicable to CSDs holding Russian Central Bank assets with a total value of more than €1 million. The profits generated by the reinvestment of these sanctioned amounts dating from 15 February 2024 onwards are required to be contributed to the European Fund for Ukraine. After retention of a 10% share of the windfall contribution to comply with capital and risk management requirements, Euroclear made a first payment of approx. €1.55 billion to the European Fund for Ukraine in July 2024. A second payment is expected to take place in March 2025 and should amount to approx. €2 billion. Issued on 16 December 2024, the 15th EU sanctions package against Russia included a loss recovery mechanism which allows for the release of cash balances held by European CSDs under certain conditions. This derogation will enable CSDs to request competent authorities to unfreeze cash balances and use them to meet their legal obligations with their clients. Euroclear continues to act prudently and to strengthen its capital by retaining the remainder of the Russian sanction related profits as a buffer against current and future risks. Euroclear is focused on minimising potential legal, financial, and operational risks that may arise for itself and its clients, while complying with its obligations. As a direct consequence of the sanctions and countermeasures, Euroclear faces multiple proceedings in Russian courts. Since Russia considers international sanctions against public order, Russian claimants initiated legal proceedings aiming mainly to access assets blocked in Euroclear Bank's books, by claiming an equivalent amount in Russian Ruble and enforcing their claim in Russia. Despite all legal actions taken by Euroclear and the considerable resources mobilised, the probability of unfavourable rulings in Russian courts is high since Russia does not recognise the international sanctions. Euroclear Bank and Euroclear Holding are the two group issuing entities. The full year 2024 summary income statements and financial positions for both entities are shown below. The drop in FY2024 figures compared to FY2023 reflects the booking of the windfall contribution related to the Central Bank of Russia's (CBR) assets dating from 15 February 2024. The evolution of FY2024 figures compared to FY2023 reflects the increase in intragroup dividend. Euroclear group is the financial industry's trusted provider of post trade services.

Title: South Dublin soccer club blaming council policy shift for sidelining 20-year clubhouse campaign
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/social-affairs/2025/02/04/south-dublin-soccer-club-blaming-council-policy-shift-for-sidelining-20-year-clubhouse-campaign/
Time Published: 2025-02-05T06:00:00Z
Full Content:
A 20-year campaign by a football club in south Co Dublin to get itself a new clubhouse is set to rumble on after it deferred its latest bid for planning permission having been told by local council officials it would not be successful. It is two decades since what is now Sallynoggin Pearse first approached Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County Council intending to replace its old and deteriorating clubhouse, its officials say. At the time, the local authority said its preference was to relocate the club around the corner from Pearse Park to Sallynoggin Park where they would be given access to a new facility which was then in the planning stage. Planning permission was subsequently obtained in 2007 but the project never went ahead and the then Pearse Rovers stayed where they were. By 2018 relocating the club became a priority when its existing clubhouse was vandalised. After the council initially said again it would build a new clubhouse in Sallynoggin Park if the club gave up its legal claim to a pitch a local land owner had allowed them to start using almost 50 years earlier, a deal was eventually agreed based on the club funding construction and the council proving the long term lease required to secure grants and loans once the project was in train. Since then, club chairman Richie Cummins says the club has deferred making of planning applications three times at the council’s suggestion. And it was told at a meeting in November the local authority would not now be honouring its commitment to the long-term lease. “The pre-planning stuff was all positive,” he says. “We are meeting the criteria for mixed-use facilities, not-for-profit groups sharing the facilities with sports groups. We’re ticking all the boxes. There is no issue with the building, no issue with the location of the building. So, we’re at a loss as to what the big issue is here.” Sallynoggin Pearse, the product of a 2010 merger between Pearse Rovers, where Paul McGrath played as a teenager (the hope is to name the clubhouse in his honour), and Sallynoggin Celtic, is a relatively small club. It has just two adult men’s teams, although Cummins makes the point it used to be much bigger and could grow again if it had more certainty over its future facilities. What it has done, however, is form a partnership with Granada FC, which has 90 teams and 1,500 young players. It hopes to use the new clubhouse along with a boxing club and kick-boxing club. Dublin Fire Brigade sports club are interested, a local gardening group would like to use it, and there is talk of a dancing club too. “It’s not just football,” says Cummins. “There’d be other groups using it which is important. The crime prevention officer from Dún Laoghaire said our current building (a 40ft shipping container) was vandalised and the previous building was vandalised because of not being used enough. But the council have used it as another excuse not to support us, saying we are looking for a community centre rather than a sports facility. We have never used that term but we do want something that is of benefit to the community.” He gives a vivid account of dealing with council officialdom, with everything — people, policies, allocated plots of land and pitch allocations — shifting over time. At one point, he and fellow club committee members Shane O’Brien and Paul Bishop say it was suggested they get a solicitor’s letter written to inject urgency into the council’s position — only for the official who had suggested it to stop engaging because they had “gone legal”. The council’s current offer is a vandal proof prefab which, the club was told, would cost more than €200,000 but contain just two dressingrooms and no showers. “Are you really expecting teenage girls to share that with either teenage boys or men?,” asks Granada chairman Ciarán Kane, who says wider frustration with the council over facilities and pitches in particular, has prompted clubs across the area to set aside their rivalries to co-ordinate their campaign for improvements. The lack of joined-up thinking, he says, is also evident in his own club’s home facility in Blackrock which, he says, they are delighted to have but which they have been told they should not make available to community groups during weekdays when it is underutilised. Sallynoggin Pearse might settle for that but instead find themselves frustrated by a shift in council policy which, says Cummins, involves a move away from granting long-term leases to clubs. He cites a recent example of that happening to another club. “We’re not asking them for a penny,” he says. “Just that they honour the commitment they gave us when we gave up our claim to a pitch they wanted. They are creating a situation here where nobody can trust them.” The club has, he says, widespread support among councillors and local TD Richard Boyd Barrett describes the council’s treatment of the club as “shameful” and “inexplicable”. “You would think they would be encouraging projects like this but instead they are putting obstacles in their way. It’s hard to understand, but it’s not unique, I’m not exaggerating when I say I am inundated with clubs in the area raising issues over facilities, pitches and particularly all-weather pitches,” said the People Before Profit–Solidarity TD. Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County Council did not respond to requests for comment. Emmet Malone is Work Correspondent at The Irish Times © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Strong interest is expected in the upcoming forward purchase sale of 18 Newmarket Square, one of the few build-to-rent developments expected to come to market this year. It’s understood the development of more than 130 apartments in the Liberties in Dublin 8, which is still under construction, will be brought to the market by CBRE in the first quarter of this year at an asking price of about €80 million. 18 Newmarket Square, which is expected to complete around September of this year, was developed by Revelate Capital, an Irish specialist private equity real estate business, along with Valpre Capital, a London-based private equity real estate investment firm and a UBS-owned real estate platform, Aventicum Real Estate. It is located around a 10-minute walk from St Stephen’s Green and amenities are expected to include a co-working lounge, communal rooftop gardens and a landscaped courtyard, as well as about 500sq m of retail space. The Liberties development is not the only deal of scale coming to the market this year; the sale of a large city centre asset is also due to be announced, with an asking price expected to be in the region of €180 million. Last year residential transactions remained low, at about €466 million – the largest deal was the €150 million sale of the Point Campus student accommodation by German asset manager DWS. It was acquired by US fund Greystar. Developers say issues such as the rent cap, which is up for review at the end of the year, is a factor in the lack of new private rented sector developments. Other residential developments expected to complete this year include Marlet’s Claremont development of more than 500 units in Howth, north Dublin, and Lioncor’s development at Alta Verde in Blackrock, in the south of the city.
