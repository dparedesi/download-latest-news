On Friday, JPMorgan expressed a positive outlook on MakeMyTrip (NASDAQ:MMYT) stock, raising the company's price target from $100.00 to $120.00 while maintaining an Overweight rating. The firm's stance is based on expectations of a 20% revenue increase over the next three years and continued margin expansion. The firm supports their Overweight rating by highlighting the potential for increased online penetration in MakeMyTrip's various segments. This is anticipated to sustain growth exceeding 20% in the medium term. Additionally, they foresee benefits from operating leverage and a competitive environment that could further enhance the company's profit margins. Despite a recent 21% decline in MakeMyTrip's stock over the last ten days, which contrasts with a stable NASDAQ, JPMorgan views this pullback as an opportunity for investors. The firm believes the underlying fundamentals of growth and margin prospects remain intact. They note that the stock had previously experienced a 24% surge in September. JPMorgan also identifies MakeMyTrip as a strategic investment in secular growth trends, driven by its Air (international share) and Corporate business segments. The firm suggests that MakeMyTrip is transitioning into a high-quality investment reflecting aspirational consumption, which could benefit from broader secular trends including rising disposable incomes, increased travel budgets, and a growing inclination to travel.
