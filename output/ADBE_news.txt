Software was once the hottest industry on Wall Street. Not so in the AI era. S&P 500 software stocks lagged the broader index for the second consecutive year in 2025 as companies making the “picks and shovels” of the AI buildout—like semiconductors and memory devices—led the stock market higher. And analysts expect the challenges weighing on software stocks, especially application developers, to persist in 2026. One example: Oppenheimer on Tuesday downgraded Adobe (ADBE) stock to “Perform” from “Outperform” and withdrew its price target entirely, citing threats from AI that apply to varying degrees across the application software industry. The news pulled Adobe, shares of which have lost more than a fifth of their value over the past 12 months, down more than 5% on Tuesday. Software stocks were expected to have a strong 2025 supported by the deployment of AI agents. The rollout of those agents has moved much slower than expected, weighing on investor sentiment and raising concerns about the software industry's vulnerability to AI disruption. One of the primary issues Adobe faces, according to Oppenheimer, is the perception that AI is weakening its competitive position. Gen AI “is increasing the velocity of content creation while lowering price and subscriber growth,” wrote analysts led by Brian Schwartz. The company faces new competition from LLM providers like OpenAI and advertising platforms like Meta, which have introduced creative tools that allow people other options for doing what previously required an Adobe license and specialized knowledge. Investors also worry that generative AI could upend the seat-based pricing model on which many software-as-a-service providers like Adobe are built. Traditionally, Adobe sells a client a set number of Creative Cloud licenses for a set amount of time, which has meant reliable revenue. It and other software companies will have to adapt if the usage-based pricing—in which a customer pays each time they use a service—favored by AI developers and hyperscalers becomes the norm. Even if seat-based models remain standard, AI threatens to undercut software subscription growth by helping companies to get by with smaller teams and lowering the cost of switching vendors, according to a recent Deutsche Bank note. AI isn’t seen as a threat to all software companies. Infrastructure software stocks performed well last year as companies accelerated IT modernization and cloud migration efforts as they sought to transition to more AI usage, according to Deutsche Bank. Shares of data analytics software provider Palantir (PLTR) more than doubled in value last year as its commercial sales soared. Cloud migrations also helped support shares of companies like MongoDB (MDB) and Snowflake (SNOW). Morgan Stanley analysts expect many of the trends that fueled last year's infrastructure software rally to carry into 2026. They argue the rollout of AI copilots and agents should support demand for data management and observability tools, as should robust cloud growth. Cloud and AI spending are expected to remain top priorities for companies this year. Cloud spending growth is expected to hold steady at 10%, according to a Jefferies survey of IT executives and chief investment officers. That survey also found that, on average, nearly 12% of IT budgets will be dedicated to AI this year, up from 6.5% last year. Adobe's stock is down more than 50% since peaking in 2021. About half of the analysts with current ratings tracked by Visible Alpha rate Adobe stock a “Buy,” while two are neutral and three recommend selling. The average price target near $392 represents 26% upside from Tuesday’s close.

Investing Stocks that plunged on the open on the Federal Reserve subpoena news reversed sharply and ended higher across the board by the close. Fourth-quarter earnings will kick off with the big Wall Street banks reporting this week With some spicy economic news on tap, like today’s December Consumer Price Index print, which is expected to be 2.7% year-over-year, it could move markets. Sending You to Google News in 3 © Chaay_Tee / iStock via Getty Images The futures are trending higher after the December consumer price index came in at 2.7%, which matched Wall Street expectations. The reversal in the futures comes after a wild Monday that saw stocks get hammered on the open, amid news of Department of Justice subpoenas sent to Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell regarding his testimony to Congress last summer. Initially, all the major indices plunged on the news, then reversed sharply to finish higher on the day. Both the Dow Jones Industrials, which closed up 0.17% at 49,590, and the S&P 500, which ended the day higher by 0.16% at 6,977, once again printed new all-time highs as the January strength continues. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was last seen at 23,833, up 0.25%, and the Russel 2000 continued its red-hot start to the year, closing at 2,635, up 0.44%. The R2K is leading all the major indices in 2026, up 5.7% on the year. Wall Street is now looking forward to the start of the fourth-quarter earnings, with the big money-center banks reporting later this week. Yields were higher across the entire Treasury curve on Monday, and you can bet that the controversy with the Federal Reserve receiving subpoenas was a big reason for the selling. The uncertainty about Fed independence and the potential for government intervention pushed bond prices down, echoing past “Sell America” events in 2025. The reality is this will likely blow over quickly, as a mountain of economic news and the start of earnings season will redirect attention. The 30-year bond closed at 4.84%, while the benchmark 10-year note was last seen at 4.19%. Prices were higher across the energy complex on Monday as geopolitical tensions in multiple regions around the globe and the potential for long-term changes to the global oil supply drove crude oil prices higher, with the WTI and Brent benchmarks both climbing. Brent Crude closed trading on Monday at $64.01, up 1.06%, while West Texas Intermediate finished the session at $59.63, up 0.85%. Natural gas stormed back after a wave of frigid weather swept across a large swath of the U.S. Monday, closing up 6.5% at $3.38. In what seems like a never-ending story, Gold closed Monday at $4,596, up another 1.94%. Wall Street’s $5,000 price targets for the precious metal could arrive much sooner than expected. The combination of numerous geopolitical hotspots and Federal Reserve news once again provided the stiff tailwind that has been present for well over a year. Silver also bolted higher on Monday, climbing a massive 6.6% to close trading at $85.14. Wall Street’s $100 price targets are getting closer by the week, and with most rebalancing finished, the path for Silver looks higher. The crypto market traded range-bound and sideways on Monday, influenced by a “risk-off” environment, much like other asset classes, driven by rising geopolitical tensions and uncertainty over U.S. monetary policy, including the escalating dispute between the Trump administration and Federal Reserve Chair Powell. At 8A EST, Bitcoin was quoted at $92,010, while Ethereum was posted at $3, 131. 24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports daily to identify new investment ideas for both investors and traders.
