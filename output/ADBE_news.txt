We recently published a list of Top 10 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) stands against other top trending AI stocks on latest news. The bloodbath that triggered one of the biggest routs in US stock markets appears to be under control. Even as people across China hail the success of their homegrown tech startup DeepSeek, it’s becoming increasingly clear there is room for everyone in the artificial intelligence race. That’s the sentiment echoed across the board as it becomes clear markets might have overreacted on reports China is at the forefront of developing AI models at the lowest costs possible. A day after US stocks came under pressure amid the DeepSeek revelations, developers at leading US AI firms have already started praising DeepSeek AI models, touting them as Sputnik models. Some AI experts praised DeepSeek’s robust team and state-of-the-art research, but they were unconcerned by the development as concerns about competition rippled through the U.S. stock market. “The dust is now settling after Monday’s long overdue AI reckoning, and while we still believe in the AI-driven productivity story, investing in this sector going forward may not be as easy as it was over the past two years,” said Emily Bowersock Hill at Bowersock Capital Partners. “We expect investors to be more discerning and selective when it comes to AI investing.” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman wrote on X that R1, one of DeepSeek’s models, “is an impressive model, particularly around what they’re able to deliver for the price.” Nvidia also echoed the sentiments, stating DeepSeek’s achievement proved the need for more of its chips. According to US President Donald Trump, the release of DeepSeek’s AI models should be a wake-up call on the need to be laser-focused on competing to win. The sentiments come from the Hype around the new AI models triggering over $1 trillion in US and European tech stocks. The sentiments come at the backdrop of reports that AI presents a $15 trillion opportunity over the next few years, given the transformation it is poised to bring in various sectors. Therefore, there is room for every company to leverage technology to strengthen its competitive edge. Barclays has already reiterated that companies offering advanced AI services are well poised to benefit from the availability of cost-effective AI models. In contrast, companies working on expensive hardware needed to enable and power AI should remain under scrutiny if DeepSeek’s revelations that it’s possible to develop AI models using common or cheap chips are anything to go by. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.

Top economic experts project that inflation rates will decelerate in 2025, approaching the Federal Reserve's 2% target by the second half of the year. This outlook suggests a stabilization of price levels, which could influence monetary policy decisions. US Bank Chief Economist Beth Ann Bovino offered insights into the Federal Reserve's anticipated actions. She predicted that the Fed would implement two interest rate cuts in 2025, citing continued economic strength. Bovino also noted that proposed tariffs and tax cuts by the new administration could exert additional inflationary pressures, potentially complicating the Fed's policy decisions. The fiscal policies of the new administration are expected to play a significant role in shaping the economic landscape. Bank of America analysts Claudio Irigoyen and Aditya Bhave discussed the interplay between US policy changes and the global economy. They anticipated that fiscal policy would be expansionary through tax cuts and acknowledged that proposed tariff increases could have a modest impact on consumer price inflation. Their analysis underscored the importance of balancing growth initiatives with inflation control. In terms of sector performance, Standard Chartered Bank expressed optimism about equities and commodities. Entering 2025, the bank was overweight in equities and gold, citing a resilient global economy with a projected GDP growth of 3%.
