ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Adobe stock (NASDAQ: ADBE) is seeing some gains after it recently reported strong quarterly results and provided an optimistic outlook, which was a bit of a surprise. Why do we say it's surprising? Well, in the past, Adobe's stock has actually dropped the day after its earnings reports 75% of the time. So, the big question is, should you buy ADBE stock right now at around $360? We believe the answer is yes. Adobe has been a bit of an underperformer this year, down about 20% while the S&P 500 is up 12%. Part of this is due to its slower-than-expected growth in the AI space. This past quarter, the company's annual recurring revenue (ARR) from AI-influenced products reached over $5 billion, which is an increase from the $3.5 billion at the end of fiscal year 2024. To be frank, a $5 billion figure might seem small for a company of Adobe's size, especially when other tech giants like Google and OpenAI are generating much more from the AI boom. However, the market is smart and has likely already taken this slower AI growth into account. At its current price of $360, ADBE stock is trading at 18 times its trailing adjusted earnings. That's half of its five-year average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 36. This means that from a valuation standpoint, ADBE looks very attractive. Beyond the valuation, our analysis of Adobe’s performance across key areas like Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience shows that the company has a strong operational and financial foundation. We'll delve into these factors in the sections below. That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Separately, see – XRP Price To Hit $10 In October? Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, ADBE stock looks slightly expensive compared to the broader market. Adobe's Revenues have seen notable growth over recent years. Adobe's profit margins are considerably higher than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. Adobe's balance sheet looks very strong. ADBE stock has fared worse than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. Worried about the impact of a market crash on ADBE stock? Our dashboard Will You Be Comfortable Buying Adobe Stock? has a detailed analysis of how the stock performed during and after previous market crashes. In summary, Adobe's performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows: Despite being more expensive than the benchmark index, Adobe's valuation has become much more attractive recently. Given the company's strong performance in the above parameters and attractive valuation, we believe ADBE stock is a good buy right now. Of course, we could be wrong, and investors may not be willing to pay a premium for the stock due to its slower-than-expected AI growth. However, if you have a 3-5 year investment horizon, our conclusion is that ADBE is a good stock to own at current levels. While ADBE stock looks promising, investing in a single stock can be risky. On the other hand, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming its benchmark that includes all 3 - the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Adobe Says AI Sales Are Coming in Strong. But Will It Lift the Stock?

Adobe (ADBE) just reported record quarterly revenue driven by artificial intelligence gains. Will it revive confidence in the stock? The creative software giant late Thursday posted adjusted earnings per share of $5.31 on revenue that jumped 11% year-over-year to a record $5.99 billion in the fiscal third quarter, above analysts' estimates compiled by Visible Alpha, as AI revenues topped company targets. CEO Shantanu Narayen said that with the third-quarter's revenue driven by AI, Adobe has already surpassed its "AI-first" revenue goals for the year, leading the company to boost its outlook. The company said it now anticipates full-year adjusted earnings of $20.80 to $20.85 per share and revenue of $23.65 billion to $23.7 billion, up from adjusted earnings of $20.50 to $20.70 on revenue of $23.50 billion to $23.6 billion previously. Shares of Adobe were recently rising in late trading. But they've had a tough year so far, with the stock down more than 20% for 2025 through Thursday's close amid worries about the company's AI progress and growing competition. Wall Street is optimistic. The shares finished Thursday a bit below $351, and the mean price target as tracked by Visible Alpha, above $461, represents a more than 30% premium. Most of the analysts tracking the stock have "buy" ratings. But even that target represents a degree of caution in the context of recent highs. The shares were above $600 in February 2024.

Title: The Everyday Investor’s Report For Thursday, September 11

ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. Stock prices dipped slightly in trading Wednesday after Oracle reported an upbeat outlook for cloud revenue and the Producer Price Index revealed a decline in wholesale prices in August. The S&P 500 fell 0.28% after the opening bell Wednesday. The Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.43% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.53%. Technology company Oracle reported earnings after the close of trading Tuesday. The headlining takeaway was the company’s expectation of generating $144 billion in cloud infrastructure revenue in fiscal 2030, up from an expected $18 billion this fiscal year. Oracle’s cloud revenue has benefited from the AI build out. The ample projection suggests there’s still momentum in AI stocks. The Producer Price Index, known as the PPI, declined 0.1% in August after rising 0.7% in July. The Core PPI, which excludes food and energy, rose 0.3% as expected. Investors are watching pricing data closely. Higher-than-expected increases could influence when and how quickly the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates. The Fed’s next interest-rate decision will be announced on September 17. Stock futures are slightly up of the market open on Thursday. Futures tracking the S&P 500 rose 0.2%. Contracts tied to the technology-focused Nasdaq 100 rose 0.27%. And Dow Jones futures rose 0.19%. Events on the calendar for September 11 that could influence stock prices include: What’s your investing goal? Having a defined investing goal helps you make better trading decisions. Knowing the goal helps you understand the timeline and influences the level of risk you should accept. Consider two common investing goals: investing to fund a comfortable retirement and investing to pay for your kid’s college education. Both goals have a timeline and personal level of significance. For example, you may hope to retire at age 55—but you’re willing to wait until age 60 to maintain a specific lifestyle. Or perhaps you intend to save enough to fund a private university education for your kid, and you view that goal as non-negotiable. These parameters should affect how much you invest, the types of investments you buy and the decisions you make during tough market cycles. Your approach to retirement saving or college funding should differ from an approach designed to create gains as quickly as possible. Why? Because you can’t afford to lose your nest egg or your kid’s college funding. So, figure out why you’re investing and evaluate your trading impulses against the goal. Ask yourself: will this trade serve the goal? This one habit can improve your results significantly over time.

Title: Adobe And Applied Materials Stand Out For Fat Profit Margins
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/johndorfman/2025/09/08/adobe-and-applied-materials-stand-out-for-fat-profit-margins/

ByJohn Dorfman, Contributor. High profits are the engine that can drive pleasant returns for shareholders. Beyond that, on a societal level, profits provide the signals that make the capitalist system work. These signals are the reason capitalist economies have fewer gluts and shortages than centrally planned (Communist) economies. High profits lure in new competitors, raising the supply of goods and services that are in high demand. Low profits cause some companies to abandon the field, in a process the economist Joseph Schumpeter called “creative destruction.” This is why we don’t currently have a glut of buggy whips or video cassettes. Here are five stocks that boast unusually high profit margins, and that I think deserve consideration as investments. You may know Adobe Inc. (ADBE) as the company whose software enables the display of graphics on your computer screen. Adobe has increased its sales at a 20% annual clip for the past decade, and profits have grown even faster. Adobe’s growth slowed in the past year, but the growth rate was still nicely into the teens. The company’s net (after tax) profit margin is 30%. The stock trades for 22 times recent earnings but only 15 times analysts’ estimate of earnings for 2026. I try not to be too influenced by personal experiences, but I have found Adobe’s customer service to be superb. One of the world’s largest makers of semiconductor manufacturing equipment, Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT) is based in Santa Clara, California. Its sales growth over the past decade has been north of 17% a year. Its net profit margin is close to 24%. Although the stock has appreciated more than 900% in the past ten years, so far this year it’s down a small fraction. I think the weakness mostly reflects the U.S.-China trade conflict. Applied Materials gets about 25% of its sales in China. Based in Denver, Colorado, Anglogold Ashanti Plc (AU) is a gold mining company. Most of its mines are in Africa, but it also has mines in Australia and the Americas. The price of gold has risen more than 40% in the past year, amid government deficits, inflation, and international tensions. I think those problems will continue through 2026 and that gold’s momentum therefore will continue as well. Anglogold Ashani has a net profit margin of more than 23%. United Therapeutics Corp. (UTHR), based in Silver Spring, Maryland, is known mainly for drugs to treat high blood pressure in the arteries around the lungs. I’ve owned the stock a couple of times over the years and regret that I haven’t owned it this year, since it jumped 33% in the past month. I sold my shares in 2024 because I thought that Merck & Co. might wrest away leadership in its niche. So far that hasn’t happened, and United Therapeutics is also developing drugs outside its traditional niche, such as treatments for liver and kidney disease. Its net margin is 40%. Zoom Communications Inc. (ZM) had first-mover advantage in the market for online meetings software. Lately Microsoft Teams and Google Meet have chipped into its market share. Zoom’s growth – spectacular during the pandemic – has flattened out. Nonetheless, Zoom remains a significant player in online meetings, with roughly half the market. Its net profit margin is a fat 25%. The stock, which rose above $500 in 2020, has subsided to $83, and I think it is probably a good buy at the current price. I’ve written 15 columns before this one on stocks with fat profit margins. Results have been mixed and strange, but a little more good than bad. The average 12-month return on my recommendations has been 16.3%. That beats the average return for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Total Return index over the same periods, which was 15.8%. Bear in mind that my column results are hypothetical and shouldn’t be confused with results I obtain for clients. Also, past performance doesn’t predict the future. The odd thing is that my picks, while profitable 10 times out of 15, have beaten the index only four times. My average return beat the benchmark mainly because of great returns in 2014-2015 (83.2%) and 2020-2021 (78.6%). My picks from a year ago didn’t get traction. They were up only 0.1%, trailing the S&P by 15 percentage points, mostly because of a 37% loss in ON Semiconductor Corp. The best gainer was Snap-on Inc. (SNA), which returned 16.9%. Disclosure: I own Anglogold Ashanti personally and for most of my clients. I own Applied Materials for a few clients.
