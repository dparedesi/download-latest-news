Design software developer Adobe (ADBE) is slated to report fiscal second-quarter earnings after the bell Thursday, and investors are expecting a relatively modest share movement to follow. Options pricing suggests traders anticipate Adobe stock to move about 6.6% in either direction the day after its earnings report. A move of that scale would lift shares to roughly $440, their highest level in three months, or drop them to about $386, a one-month low. Adobe shares slipped 0.8% to $412.84 on Wednesday. The stock is down about 7% since the start of the year. Adobe stock has registered an average post-earnings move of 12.6% over the past four quarters, and fell in three of those instances. A 6.6% gain or loss on Friday would represent the stock’s smallest post-earnings move since December 2023. In March, shares dropped nearly 14% the day after Adobe reported record quarterly revenue but issued an outlook that underwhelmed investors. In December, it was a similar story: a worse-than-expected forecast sent shares tumbling more than 13%. Most analysts are bullish on Adobe's long-term outlook. Of the 17 Adobe analysts tracked by Visible Alpha, 10 rate the stock a “buy,” six are neutral, and one rates it a “sell.” The average price target of about $477 is more than 15% above the stock’s closing price on Wednesday. Morgan Stanley analysts earlier this week said investor concerns about Adobe's long-term competitiveness and generative AI opportunity should help Adobe "step over a low bar" when results come out Wednesday. The bank assigns the stock an "overweight" rating and an above-consensus price target of $510.

(Photo Illustration by Cheng Xin/Getty Images) Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) will announce its earnings on Thursday, June 12, 2025. Historically, the stock has shown negative reactions the day following earnings announcements. In the last five years, Adobe’s stock has declined in 70% of cases, with a median drop of 7.4% and a maximum one-day loss of 16.8%. For traders focused on events, recognizing these historical trends can provide a competitive edge. You have two primary strategies to think about: Analysts anticipate Adobe’s earnings to be $4.97 per share with sales of $5.8 billion. This reflects an increase from the same quarter last year, during which earnings were $4.48 per share on revenue of $5.31 billion. Although the company’s subscription business has been thriving and is likely to boost sales this quarter, revenue growth in the generative AI sector has lagged behind expectations. It will be intriguing to observe how this trend evolves in the forthcoming report. Regarding the fundamentals, Adobe currently boasts a market capitalization of $180 billion. Over the past twelve months, the company has generated $22 billion in revenue, with $8.0 billion in operating profits and a net income of $6.8 billion.

For instance, if 1D and 5D display the highest correlation, a trader can take a “long” position for the next 5 days if the 1D post-earnings return is positive. Below is some correlation data based on 5-year and 3-year (more recent) history. Note that the correlation 1D_5D pertains to the relationship between 1D post-earnings returns and following 5D returns. ADBE Correlation Between 1D, 5D and 21D Historical Returns Occasionally, the performance of peers can impact the post-earnings stock reaction. In fact, the price adjustment might start before the earnings are disclosed. Here is some historical data comparing the past post-earnings performance of Adobe stock with the stock performance of peers that reported earnings just prior to Adobe.
