Title: What’s Happening With Adobe Stock?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Adobe stock (NASDAQ: ADBE) is seeing some gains after it recently reported strong quarterly results and provided an optimistic outlook, which was a bit of a surprise. Why do we say it's surprising? Well, in the past, Adobe's stock has actually dropped the day after its earnings reports 75% of the time. So, the big question is, should you buy ADBE stock right now at around $360? We believe the answer is yes. Adobe has been a bit of an underperformer this year, down about 20% while the S&P 500 is up 12%. Part of this is due to its slower-than-expected growth in the AI space. This past quarter, the company's annual recurring revenue (ARR) from AI-influenced products reached over $5 billion, which is an increase from the $3.5 billion at the end of fiscal year 2024. To be frank, a $5 billion figure might seem small for a company of Adobe's size, especially when other tech giants like Google and OpenAI are generating much more from the AI boom. However, the market is smart and has likely already taken this slower AI growth into account. At its current price of $360, ADBE stock is trading at 18 times its trailing adjusted earnings. That's half of its five-year average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 36. This means that from a valuation standpoint, ADBE looks very attractive. Beyond the valuation, our analysis of Adobe’s performance across key areas like Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience shows that the company has a strong operational and financial foundation. We'll delve into these factors in the sections below. That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Separately, see – XRP Price To Hit $10 In October? Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, ADBE stock looks slightly expensive compared to the broader market. Adobe's Revenues have seen notable growth over recent years. Adobe's profit margins are considerably higher than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. Adobe's balance sheet looks very strong. ADBE stock has fared worse than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. Worried about the impact of a market crash on ADBE stock? Our dashboard Will You Be Comfortable Buying Adobe Stock? has a detailed analysis of how the stock performed during and after previous market crashes. In summary, Adobe's performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows: Despite being more expensive than the benchmark index, Adobe's valuation has become much more attractive recently. Given the company's strong performance in the above parameters and attractive valuation, we believe ADBE stock is a good buy right now. Of course, we could be wrong, and investors may not be willing to pay a premium for the stock due to its slower-than-expected AI growth. However, if you have a 3-5 year investment horizon, our conclusion is that ADBE is a good stock to own at current levels. While ADBE stock looks promising, investing in a single stock can be risky. On the other hand, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming its benchmark that includes all 3 - the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
