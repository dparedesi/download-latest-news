More smartphone screen, with the company's latest stock market chart visible in the background, reflecting investor sentiment and recent trading activity, on June 08, 2025, in Chongqing, China. (Photo Illustration by Cheng Xin/Getty Images) Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) will announce its earnings on Thursday, June 12, 2025. Historically, the stock has shown negative reactions the day following earnings announcements. In the last five years, Adobe’s stock has declined in 70% of cases, with a median drop of 7.4% and a maximum one-day loss of 16.8%. For traders focused on events, recognizing these historical trends can provide a competitive edge. You have two primary strategies to think about: Analysts anticipate Adobe’s earnings to be $4.97 per share with sales of $5.8 billion. This reflects an increase from the same quarter last year, during which earnings were $4.48 per share on revenue of $5.31 billion. Although the company’s subscription business has been thriving and is likely to boost sales this quarter, revenue growth in the generative AI sector has lagged behind expectations. It will be intriguing to observe how this trend evolves in the forthcoming report. Regarding the fundamentals, Adobe currently boasts a market capitalization of $180 billion. Over the past twelve months, the company has generated $22 billion in revenue, with $8.0 billion in operating profits and a net income of $6.8 billion.

ADBE 1D, 5D, and 21D Post Earnings Return A strategy with relatively lower risk (though not effective if the correlation is weak) is to investigate the correlation between short-term and medium-term returns post earnings, identify a pair with the highest correlation, and execute the suitable trade. For instance, if 1D and 5D display the highest correlation, a trader can take a “long” position for the next 5 days if the 1D post-earnings return is positive. Below is some correlation data based on 5-year and 3-year (more recent) history. Note that the correlation 1D_5D pertains to the relationship between 1D post-earnings returns and following 5D returns. ADBE Correlation Between 1D, 5D and 21D Historical Returns Occasionally, the performance of peers can impact the post-earnings stock reaction. In fact, the price adjustment might start before the earnings are disclosed. Here is some historical data comparing the past post-earnings performance of Adobe stock with the stock performance of peers that reported earnings just prior to Adobe. For an equitable comparison, peer stock returns are also represented as post-earnings one-day (1D) returns.

Last week, markets closed in the green, with the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all notching gains amid a bumper crop of political drama. The most explosive news came from the sudden and very public rupture between President Trump and Elon Musk, a feud that helped trigger Tesla’s (TSLA) worst stock plunge in over a year. On the macro side, Friday’s jobs report showed a still-solid labor market, reinforcing expectations that rate cuts will remain on hold. In contrast, however, forward-looking layoff data from Challenger Gray pointed to a chill spreading through white-collar ranks that’s worth watching. The week ahead promises plenty of fresh catalysts. Apple’s (AAPL) Worldwide Developers Conference kicks off , with investors watching closely for AI announcements that could reenergize the company’s growth. Midweek brings the latest Consumer Price Index report, a key gauge of inflation. And while earnings season is winding down, reports from Oracle (ORCL) and Adobe (ADBE) will offer insight as to whether corporate belt-tightening is easing or just beginning. Expect loads of coverage as Apple kicks off its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), with the keynote address scheduled for 1:00 p.m. ET. The tech giant is expected to unveil updates to its various OS offerings, perhaps alongside some news of much-hoped-for AI expansion. With Apple shares deeply lagging the broader market this year (down 17% vs. the Nasdaq’s 1.5% gain), WWDC could be a turning point for sentiment. Also on the calendar: earnings from Casey’s General Stores (CASY), the gas station and convenience chain with a strong rural footprint. The company reports before the market opens, with Wall Street expecting increased sales and decreased profits. GameStop (GME) reports after the bell. While the company’s core business has continued to struggle, investors will be watching closely for updates on GameStop’s recent $500 million Bitcoin investment and what it signals about the retailer’s evolving identity. Also reporting after hours: Dave & Buster’s (PLAY), with analysts look looking for clues about the state of consumer discretionary spending, especially among younger adults and families. On the economic front, the National Federation of Independent Business will release its May Small Business Optimism Index before the market open, giving Wall Street a read on Main Street’s hiring plans and confidence levels. Oracle will report earnings after the market closes, providing investors with an important read on enterprise tech demand and AI-related spending. But the main event is inflation. At 8:30 a.m. ET, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will release the May Consumer Price Index (CPI). Analysts and investors will be parsing the data for any signs that tariffs and stickier components such as shelter are driving prices higher. With the Fed meeting just a week away, it’s likely this CPI print could prove pivotal. Adobe will release earnings after the market close, with analysts expecting revenue around $5.8 billion, reflecting continued growth in Adobe’s digital media and enterprise AI products. On the economic front, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will release the May Producer Price Index (PPI) at 8:30 a.m. ET, providing a look at inflation at the wholesale level. Weekly initial jobless claims for the week ending June 7 will be reported at the same time. The previous week saw 247,000 new claims, a worrying sign. No major earnings reports are scheduled, but markets will be tuned in at 10:00 a.m. ET for the preliminary June reading of the University of Michigan’s Consumer Sentiment Index. While typically considered a second-tier indicator, Michigan sentiment can behave like canary in the coal mine during economic downturns, so this one could carry extra weight.

Title: What To Expect in Markets This Week: May Inflation Data, Apple Conference, GameStop Earnings

News from a tech giant, inflation data and earnings from a meme-stock legend are among the highlights of the week ahead in markets. Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference opens the week with a keynote session from CEO Tim Cook scheduled for Monday. Cook will likely use the event to address the company's new products, services, and partnerships. GameStop could clarify its cryptocurrency strategy on the company's earnings call, set for Tuesday. Key companies in the growing artificial intelligence (AI) market are also scheduled to update investors on their financials during the week. A U.S. inflation report scheduled for Wednesday could indicate whether President Donald Trump’s tariffs are beginning to have an effect on the economy. The news follows a healthy jobs report Friday. After markets shook off trade tensions last week to bring the S&P 500 back above 6000, investors will keep an eye on tariffs as Trump’s deadline on trade deals approaches. At the same time, the Senate will continue to work toward passage of Trump’s “Big, Beautiful” budget bill amid increasing criticism from Tesla CEO and former Department of Government Efficiency Chief Elon Musk. Read to the bottom for our calendar of key events—and one more thing. Wednesday’s expected release of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) will be the first look at inflation from May. With a Federal Reserve meeting around the corner, the report could set the tone for the central bank as it faces pressure from Trump to lower interest rates. Fed officials are in their blackout period ahead of their next two-day meeting, which begins June 17. Trump’s tariffs will be a key topic in Friday’s consumer sentiment report, which dropped for four straight months before leveling out in May. Consumers are consistently worried that tariffs will drive inflation higher, sending the closely watched survey to some of its lowest readings since the pandemic. As inflation has lately appeared in check, the freefall in sentiment may have hit bottom. GameStop’s (GME) earnings report comes as the video-game retailer dips its toe in the cryptocurrency pool. The company, which fired up the meme stock craze in 2021 with its meteoric rise, announced in late May that it bought $500 million in bitcoin. With its retail video game business in decline, GameStop looks to emulate the playbook of Michael Saylor’s Strategy (MSTR) and other companies centering their business models on buying bitcoin. AI will be a key theme in other corporate earnings this week. Oracle’s (ORCL) report on Wednesday follows the January announcement that the database software firm would join ChatGPT maker OpenAI and SoftBank as part of a joint venture known as Stargate to build AI infrastructure. Adobe’s (ADBE) report on Thursday is also expected to focus on the company’s sales of AI-enhanced graphics software.
