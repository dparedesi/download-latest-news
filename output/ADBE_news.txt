ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Adobe (ADBE) stock merits your attention. Why? Because it offers monopoly-like high margins at a discounted price. Here are some details. While revenue growth is beneficial, this is not solely a growth viewpoint. Pricing power and high margins yield consistent, predictable profits and cash flows, decreasing risk and facilitating reinvestment of capital. The market typically rewards this. To provide some context, Adobe delivers diversified software solutions globally, including Creative Cloud subscriptions, serving enterprise clients within the Digital Media, Digital Experience, and Publishing & Advertising sectors. *LTM: Last Twelve Months But do these figures provide the complete picture? Read Buy or Sell ADBE Stock to determine whether Adobe still possesses an advantage that remains robust. Investing in a single stock can be risky, yet there is considerable merit in a more diversified approach. If you're aiming for potential gains with reduced volatility compared to holding a single stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio (HQ) – HQ has exceeded its benchmark, which is a blend of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap indices, achieving returns greater than 105% since inception. Effective risk management is essential; consider what the long-term performance of your portfolio might be if you combined 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% crypto with HQ’s performance metrics. Here is our criterion for selection: We evaluate stocks valued at over $10 Billion in market cap, filtering out those with high CFO (cash flow from operations) margins or operating margins. We also only consider stocks that have significantly decreased in valuation over the past year. Below are statistics for stocks with this selection methodology applied since 12/31/2016. That being said, Adobe has experienced some significant declines in challenging periods. It fell approximately 72.5% during the Dot-Com bubble and 67% during the Global Financial Crisis. In the 2022 inflation shock, the drop was around 60%. Even during less severe downturns, such as in 2018 and the Covid pandemic, it still saw roughly a 25% decrease in value. Therefore, despite everything working in its favor, Adobe is not immune when market conditions worsen. However, the risk is not confined to major market downturns. Stocks can decline even when the markets are performing well – consider events like earnings reports, business updates, or changes in outlook. Read ADBE Dip Buyer Analyses to review how the stock has bounced back from notable dips in the past. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising 30 stocks, has a history of comfortably outperforming its benchmark, which includes all three indices – the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000. Why is this the case? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks generate superior returns with less risk compared to the benchmark index; it’s a smoother ride, as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
