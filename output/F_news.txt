Major U.S. equities indexes were mixed on Tuesday. The technology and communication sectors outperformed ahead of a wave of marquee earnings reports, but other sectors including energy and utilities lost ground. The S&P 500 closed the session 0.2% higher. Tech sector strength helped the Nasdaq gain 0.8%, lifting the index to an all-time closing high. The Dow did not fare as well, slipping 0.4%. Shares of Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) surged 12.5% on Tuesday to notch the top daily performance of any S&P 500 stock after the electronic design automation firm posted better-than-expected quarterly results and boosted its full-year guidance. Revenue from the company's Cadence.AI portfolio, which builds generative AI and big data analysis into design processes, more than tripled year-over-year. Although Incyte (INCY) reported third-quarter profits that fell short of analysts' forecasts, the pharma company's revenue for the period exceeded expectations, and its shares jumped 12.0%. Incyte said both of its key products—cancer drug Jakafi and topical eczema treatment Opzelura—enjoyed strong demand and sales trends during the period. Application delivery company F5 (FFIV) delivered a quarterly sales and profit beat for its fiscal fourth quarter, and its shares jumped 10.1%. F5's CEO touted the company's transformation from its focus on hardware into a provider of security and software solutions better geared toward the current hybrid and cloud-based technological environment. Leidos Holdings (LDOS) shares added 9.5% after the IT services provider beat consensus estimates with its third-quarter sales and profit results. Strong bookings figures for the quarter also suggest that Leidos is poised for additional growth, and the company lifted its full-year outlook. Major U.S. defense contract wins contributed to the solid performance and upbeat forecast. Shares of tool manufacturer Stanley Black & Decker (SWK) tumbled 8.8%, the biggest drop in the S&P 500, in the wake of an underwhelming quarterly update. The company said weak demand from consumers and the auto industry pressured its performance, contributing to a quarterly sales and profit miss. Tuesday's decline sank Stanley Black & Decker into negative for 2024. Ford Motor (F) shares skidded on Tuesday, dropping 8.4% after the carmaker reported lower-than-expected third-quarter profits. Following the earnings miss, JPMorgan and Bank of America trimmed their price targets on Ford stock. However, analysts pointed to some reasons for optimism, noting that high warranty expenses contributed to the profit shortfall and highlighting the potential of the Ford Pro division. Homebuilder D.R. Horton (DHI) reported year-over-year declines in revenue and net income, falling short of estimates on the top and bottom lines. The company also issued lower-than-expected full-year sales guidance, indicating that it sees pressure from potential homebuyers holding out for lower mortgage rates. D.R. Horton shares fell 7.2%.

Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) report earning after markets close today; Ford (F) shares are sinking as the automaker reported third-quarter profit that was lower than expectation and cut its full-year outlook; McDonald's (MCD) shares are falling after same-store sales declined by more than estimates; and Boeing (BA) raises $21 billion as the machinists union strike continues. Here's what investors need to know today. Investors are anticipating the earnings report from Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) after markets close today, with analysts expecting the tech giant to post a third-quarter revenue jump of more than 12% year-over-year to $86.41 billion. Alphabet is also expected to report profit of $23.05 billion, or $1.85 a share, up from $19.69 billion, or $1.55 per share. Investors will also likely be watching for commentary from new Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Anat Ashkenazi, who took over the role in July. Shares of Alphabet are edging higher in premarket trading. McDonald's (MCD) shares are falling 2.5% in premarket trading after it reported mixed third-quarter results, with revenue of $6.87 billion and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $3.23 coming in better than estimates but net income of $2.26 billion and a same-store sales decline of 1.5% were worse than expected. McDonald's report comes as the company deals with an E. coli outbreak that caused it to briefly suspend Quarter Pounder sales in certain states. Shares of Ford (F) are down 6% in premarket trading after the automaker reported third-quarter profit that missed analysts' expectations and trimmed its full-year outlook. Ford's net income of $900 million, or 22 cents per share, declined from $1.2 billion, or 30 cents per share, last year and missed analysts' consensus estimates from Visible Alpha. The automaker said it expects full-year adjusted earnings of about $10 billion, compared to its previous projection of between $10 billion and $12 billion. Analysts are expecting to see significant earnings growth from Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) when the chipmaker reports third-quarter financial results after markets close today. Analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha expect the chipmaker to report revenue of $6.71 billion, up nearly 16% year-over-year, while the company's net income is projected to be $815.8 million, or 50 cents per share, more than double last year's $299 million, or 18 cents per share. The report comes as investors are watching the company's data center revenue, which the chipmaker doubled in its second-quarter report. AMD shares are up almost 1% in premarket trading. Boeing (BA) announced that it raised around $21 billion from sales of stock and depositary shares, coming as the troubled aerospace company looks to shore up its finances amid a costly strike by its machinists union. Boeing raised $15.81 billion after it sold 112.5 million common shares for $143 each, lower than the stock's price of $150.69 at Monday's close, and also brought in $4.91 billion from the sale of depositary shares. Shares of Boeing are 1% lower in premarket trading.

Title: Watch These Ford Price Levels as Stock Drops After Automaker Issues Soft Outlook
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/watch-these-ford-price-levels-as-stock-drops-after-automaker-issues-soft-outlook-8735786
Time Published: 2024-10-29T01:57:13Z

Shares in Ford (F) fell sharply in extended trading on Monday after the automaker posted third-quarter profit below Wall Street expectations and trimmed its full-year outlook amid ongoing high warranty costs, supply chain issues, and intensifying competition. CEO Jim Farley told analysts on the earnings call that the auto industry is in a global price war, driven by overcapacity and a flood of new electric vehicle (EV) companies. The Detroit-based automaker said its EV business lost $1.2 billion in the third quarter on sales of about 32,000 vehicles and booked a $1 billion charge to write down several EV-related manufacturing assets. Prior to Monday’s post-market fall, Ford shares had tumbled around 7% year-to-date Below, we break down the technicals on Ford’s weekly chart and discuss important post-earnings price levels to watch out for. Since bottoming out in early August, Ford shares have consolidated within an ascending triangle, a chart pattern that can signal a move lower if formed within an established downtrend, which is the case on the automaker’s chart. Indeed, the stock sits poised to test the pattern’s lower trendline after the company’s soft quarterly results, potentially opening the door for further post-earnings selling. The stock dropped 6% to $10.69 in after-hours trading Monday. Let’s analyze Ford’s chart to identify three key support levels that investors will likely be watching and point out a major overhead area worth monitoring. Upon a decisive breakdown below the ascending triangle, investors should monitor the $9.50 level. This location could attract buying interest near a trendline connecting a range of price action on the chart between August 2019 and this year’s early August low. A move lower could see the shares fall to around $8.70, an area where investors may seek entry points near a period of narrow consolidation in the second half of 2019, which also corresponds with the April 2021 pullback low. Ongoing selling could drive a bearish move down to the $7.50 region, where the stock would likely encounter support near the top trendline of a prior ascending triangle that formed on Ford’s chart in the months after the March 2020 pandemic low. If the stock makes a recovery, investors should keep a close eye on the $11.30 area, a level where shares may run into considerable overhead selling pressure near a trendline connecting multiple troughs dating back to January 2021. A volume-backed breakout above this major resistance could act as a catalyst for a bullish trend reversal.

Title: Ford Stock Drops After Automaker Misses Profit Estimates, Trims Guidance

Ford (F) reported third-quarter profit that missed analysts' expectations and trimmed its full-year outlook, sending shares lower in extended trading Monday. The automaker posted third-quarter revenue of $46.2 billion, up more than 5% year-over-year and above the analyst consensus from Visible Alpha. However, net income of $900 million or 22 cents per share declined from the $1.2 billion or 30 cents per share Ford posted a year earlier, missing estimates. Ford said it now expects full-year adjusted earnings of about $10 billion, compared to its previous estimate of $10 billion to $12 billion. The results come after Ford's second-quarter earnings missed Street estimates and analysts at Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock last month citing increased competition from China, weighing on Ford's stock price. Shares of Ford fell over 4% in extended trading following the release. They were down about 7% for the year through Monday's close.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks climbed on Monday as Middle East war fears cooled, ahead of a pivotal week packed with Big Tech earnings, an inflation update, and a crucial monthly jobs report. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped roughly 0.7%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) also moved up about 0.5%. The market was bolstered by relief that Israel limited its retaliatory strikes on Iran to military targets, and not oil or nuclear facilities as feared. Oil futures tumbled nearly 6%, taking Brent (BZ=F) down to almost $71 a barrel and West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) to near $67. The focus is on tech stocks with five of the "Magnificent Seven" megacaps due to release earnings this week, after the Nasdaq Composite bucked Friday's losing trend to close near a record. Investors are looking to Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta (META) results to help boost the S&P 500 to new heights, too. But questions remain as to whether Big Tech's investments in AI are paying off in profits. Some on Wall Street are anticipating the slowest growth in earnings for tech megacaps in six quarters. The reports are the highlight in a very busy week of results, with 169 of the S&P 500's members expected to release updates. Philips (PHG) shares sank 16% after the medical device maker cut its full-year sales outlook, citing a strong decline in Chinese demand. Ford (F) is on Monday's docket after the bell. At the same time, investors are bracing for a rush of economic data that could put bets on a "soft landing" to the test. In the forefront are the latest reading on the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge and the October jobs report — both seen as crucial to policymakers' decision on whether to cut interest rates at their November meeting.

Spotify (SPOT) shares rose nearly 1% in morning trading after Wells Fargo (WFC) named the stock a top pick, maintaining its Overweight rating and raising its price target from $420 to $470. Spotify has soared over 120% as the company has made good on its turnaround plan. After weak performance in late 2022, Spotify has announced layoffs, enacted price hikes, changed its royalty model, and picked up big podcast deals. The music streaming giant reported a record profit in its most recent quarterly earnings report this summer. Wells Fargo analyst Steven Cahall said in his note to investors Monday that Spotify "continues to demonstrate success on long-term margin expansion." Spotify reports third quarter earnings on Nov. 12, and analysts expect adjusted earnings per share to rise over 400% to $1.82 and revenue to jump 19% to $4.4 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Wall Street analysts covering the stock, on average, see shares rising to $410 over the next 12 months, according to Bloomberg data. Stocks opened higher on Monday to start a pivotal week packed with Big Tech earnings, an inflation update, and a crucial monthly jobs report. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped roughly 0.7%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) also moved up about 0.5%. Oil slid nearly 6% after Israel's retaliatory strikes on Iran spared the country's crude infrastructure. Brent (BZ=F) hovered near $71 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) traded near $67 in early trading. Investors await earnings from Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta (META) this week. The monthly inflation print and jobs report for September are also due out this week. Boeing (BA) shares ticked slightly lower in premarket after the plane maker launched an almost $19 billion share sale in a move to shore up its liquidity and avoid a credit downgrade. The company plans to sell about 90 million common shares and about $5 billion of depositary shares. Wall Street analysts had widely expected a large offering after a difficult year for the plane maker. S&P Global recently placed Boeing on CreditWatch Negative, which increased the likelihood of a downgrade if the machinist union strike at the company continues until the end of the year. Last week, a majority of workers rejected the latest labor contract proposal from Boeing. Earlier this month, the jet manufacturer said it would cut about 17,000 jobs, or 10% of its workforce. As of Sept. 30, Boeing had $56.9 billion of outstanding senior unsecured indebtedness, according to a company filing.

West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) tumbled to hover below $68 while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark, slid to trade below $72 a barrel. Tel Aviv’s attack against Iranian military facilities early Saturday were in response to Tehran’s missile strikes on October 1. Oil was volatile in the weeks preceding the retaliation with Brent touching $80 per barrel as traders speculated whether Israel would strike against Iran’s oil infrastructure. The White House advised against targeting the country's oil or nuclear facilities. Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: New 400-mile 2024 Chevy Silverado EV Work Trucks now cost same as used
URL: http://electrek.co/2024/10/28/new-400-mile-2024-chevy-silverado-ev-work-trucks-now-cost-same-as-used/
Time Published: 2024-10-28T13:24:05Z
Full Content:
A number of Chevrolet dealers across the nation are advertising a new 2024 Silverado EV in 3WT trim at around $60K, which is close to where Hertz is pricing year-old low-mileage examples of the fully electric pickup that are being culled from its rental fleet. At $74,900, including destination, the Silverado EV 3WT is perhaps a bit pricey. Fortunately, Chevrolet is offering its $7500 Ultium Promise Bonus Cash on all 2024 Silverado EV work trucks. That incentive cuts the cost of the 3WT down to $67,400 before tax and license, which seems reasonable considering it has a 393-mile range that bests other $70K electric pickups and is equipped with a host of comfort and safety features that contradict the bare-bones implication of its “work truck” moniker. We’ve been tracking dealer discounts on the Silverado EV in our Electric Vehicle Price Guide ever since the work truck first popped up in dealer inventories on the east coast a couple of months ago. Deep discounts and broadening availability are now making the Silverado EV 3WT much more attractive to shoppers. At the top of our list of discounts is Victorville Chevrolet, a dealership eighty miles northeast of Los Angeles that is advertising $19,500 off MSRP on its Silverado EV work trucks, pricing the 3WT at just $55,400. That’s two to three grand less than a previous rental with over 5000 miles on the odo. For buyers hoping to spend less than $50K, Victorville has a couple of Silverado EV 3WT work trucks with the 1FL Fleet Option priced at $49,400. The 1FL Fleet Option swaps the ruggedly attractive gloss-black aluminum rims for utilitarian-looking steel wheels. It also deletes the side steps, dual-level charge cord, and soft-top tonneau that come with the 3WT trim level. If these prices appeal to you, act quickly. Victorville Chevy’s Silverado EV inventory seems to be depleting fast as they’ve systematically increased their discount over the past several weeks. When we updated Silverado EV discounts on our Electric Vehicle Price Guide at the beginning of this month, Victorville’s online inventory showed a total of 35 electric work trucks in stock. As of this writing, less than a dozen remain, including one in 4WT trim that boasts an impressive 450-mile range. Angelenos that can’t make the trek to Victorville Chevy in time to grab one of their remaining Silverado EVs may want to consider contacting Penke Chevrolet in Cerritos about their in-stock electric work trucks listed at $15,500 off MSRP. If that doesn’t pan out, other LA-area Chevy dealers are showing 2024 Silverado EV work trucks in-transit, some already with modest discounts applied, so an increased supply may drive in-town prices lower in the near future. Outside of southern California, dealers with Silverado EV work truck discounts worth considering include Koons Chevrolet in Maryland ($15,395 off MSRP), Bomnin Chevrolet in Florida ($14,000 off MSRP), Raymond Chevrolet in Illinois and Platinum Chevrolet in northern California ($13,500 off MSRP), Capitol Chevrolet in Texas ($12,900 off MSRP), Parks Chevrolet in Virginia ($12,777 off MSRP), McLoughlin Chevrolet in Oregon ($12,743 off MSRP), and Hendrick Chevrolet in Georgia ($12,500 off MSRP). Look for discounts on a Chevrolet Silverado EV in your area. Dealer discounts on the 2024 Ford F-150 Lightning are starting to turn heads, especially those that qualify for the $7500 Federal EV Tax Credit. For example, Al Packer Ford in Florida has an F-150 Lightning XLT with a standard battery (240-mile range, MSRP $60,090) discounted by a whopping $8602. Stacking the $7500 Federal EV tax credit on top of that discount results in a net cost of just $43,988 before tax and license. For those that need more range, Ford of San Leandro in California is advertising an F-150 Lightning Flash (MSRP $71,185) at a $6500 discount, resulting in a $57,774 net cost after applying the $7500 Federal EV tax credit. The Flash trim includes an extended range battery that’s good for 320 miles on a full charge. Find a great deal on a Ford F-150 Lightning near you.

Title: How To Earn $500 A Month From Ford Stock Ahead Of Q3 Earnings

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) will release earnings results for its third quarter, after the closing bell on Monday, Oct. 28. Analysts expect the Dearborn, Michigan-based company to report quarterly earnings at 47 cents per share. That’s up from 36 cents per share in the year-ago period. Ford projects to report revenue of $41.88 billion for the recent quarter, compared to $41.22 billion a year earlier, according to data from Benzinga Pro. In the meantime, investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends. Ford currently offers an annual dividend yield of 5.42%. That’s a quarterly dividend of 15 cents per share (60 cents a year). So, how can investors exploit its dividend yield to pocket a regular $500 monthly? To earn $500 per month or $6,000 annually from dividends alone, you would need an investment of approximately $110,700 or around 10,000 shares. For a more modest $100 per month or $22,140 per year, you would need $41,805 or around 2,000 shares. To Calculate: Divide the desired annual income ($6,000 or $1,200) by the dividend ($0.60 in this case). So, $6,000 / $0.60 = 10,000 ($500 per month), and $1,200 / $0.60 = 2,000 shares ($100 per month). Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time. View more earnings on F How That works: The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock’s current price. For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and is currently priced at $50, the dividend yield would be 4% ($2/$50). However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price falls to $40, the dividend yield rises to 5% ($2/$40). Similarly, changes in the dividend payment can impact the yield. If a company increases its dividend, the yield will also increase, provided the stock price stays the same. Conversely, if the dividend payment decreases, so will the yield. Ford Outlook, Price Action: Ford CEO Jim Farley recently explained his intent behind driving the Xiaomi SU7 EV over the past six months in a post on social media on Wednesday. "I try to drive everything we compete against," Farley said. "Specs can tell part of a story, but you’ve got to get behind the wheel to truly understand and beat the competition." Ford shares fell 1.5% to close at $11.07 on Friday.

Despite the ongoing subdued market mood, Waaree Energies received the strongest subscription response from all sets of investors and also debuted slightly below our expectations. Pre listing, we had recommended profit booking if Waaree lists at double of its issue price which was the street expectations. With listing at Rs 2550, we believe the stock can deliver healthy returns post listing as well. We believe the long term investor demand would continue at the counter on the back of sector demand and expansion plans, with an opportunity to play at the largest manufacturer of solar PV modules in India, bolstered by favourable government policies and few incentive (PLI) schemes. Hence, we recommend long term investors to “HOLD” while short term investors can look for a target anywhere between Rs 2750-2800 to book profits. Fresh accumulation can be attempted anywhere between Rs 2200-2300 if the opportunity arises due to market scenario and profits booking attempts.

It fell for the fifth consecutive session. It closed lower for the fourth consecutive week falling 2.71% over the week. Indian markets have fallen on all days of the week reeling under FPI selling pressure, weak Q2 results from most corporates and rising treasury yields in the US. Though a bounce in the markets is overdue, it needs reversal of selling pressure from FPIs and some sentiment stability in the local investor community. Nifty could now take support from 23892 while 24378 could prove to be tough to breach on the up in the near term. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services. “A significant market trend during the recent days of market correction is the flight to quality. While the Nifty corrected by 8.3% from the recent peak, the mid and small cap indices corrected by 9.8% and 9.3% respectively from their recent peaks. Actually the index movements conceal the carnage in the mid and smallcaps where the correction has been above 30% in dozens of stocks and even by more than 40% in some momentum stocks. It is important to know that many largecaps are steady in this volatile market. The trend of flight to quality is likely to sustain given the good numbers from banking majors like HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank where valuations continue to be fair. Investors can profit from these polarised valuations. The global market structure may turn favourable after the subdued Israeli strikes against Iran avoiding the Iranian oil fields which has resulted in a sharp drop in crude prices. The imminent US presidential elections and the uncertainty associated with that will continue to weigh on markets.” Anand James, Chief Market Strategist, Geojit Financial Services. Nifty outlook: With Friday’s closing hour managing to push Nifty above the initial two hour’s close when the selling intensity was at its highest, we now have initial signs of a reversal. The August low of 23894 will thus act as a downside marker for all upside attempts. However, we also expect rejection trades to resurface on pull back to 24350. Derivative outlook: Nifty weekly contract has highest open interest at 25000 for Calls and 23000 for Puts while monthly contracts have highest open interest at 25000 for Calls and 23000 for Puts.

Guidance revised sharply across metrics The rupee witnessed range-bound trade and appreciated by just 1 paisa to 84.07 against the US dollar in initial deals on Monday, weighed down by significant foreign fund outflows and the strength of the American currency in the overseas market. We zoom in on the prospects of Manappuram Finance, as also the prospects of two other stocks — NHPC,andSBI Cards and Payment Service Crude oil futures traded lower on Monday morning after Israel’s retaliatory attack on Iran over the weekend, which avoided oil and nuclear facilities. This eased the market concerns about possible crude oil supply disruptions in the West Asia region. At 9.17 am on Monday, January Brent oil futures were at $72.40, down by 4.27 per cent, and December crude oil futures on WTI (West Texas Intermediate) were at $68.60, down by 4.43 per cent. November crude oil futures were trading at ₹5782 on Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) during the initial hour of trading on Monday against the previous close of ₹6040, down by 4.27 per cent, and December futures were trading at ₹5776 against the previous close of ₹6023, down by 4.10 per cent. Indian benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty opened positively on Monday, with Sensex up 0.43% at 79,741.46 and Nifty gaining 0.33% at 24,261.15, amid mixed global cues. Despite this, sentiment remains cautious, influenced by sustained FII selling and weak earnings, said Ajit Mishra, SVP at Religare Broking. Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) have sold ₹1,02,931 crore in October, impacting market momentum. The dollar index rallied for the fourth consecutive week and is keeping intact the overall uptrend. The index has risen breaking above the resistance at 104. It closed the week at 104.25, up 0.74 per cent. A strong rise in the US Treasury yields is aiding the greenback to retain its strength. Markets turning slightly cautious ahead of the US Presidential Election next month is also giving the dollar a safe-haven support. The uptrend is strong, and we expect the rally in the dollar to continue for another couple of weeks until the outcome of the US elections is known. Sudarshan Chemical (SCIL) announced a large acquisition of Germany-based Heubach Group at a highly discounted valuation on October 11. The speciality chemicals player manufactures colour pigments and is the largest domestic player. While the leap the company has made is commendable and at the opportune moment, investors may hold the stock till further details emerge. The roadmap in turning around the acquisition, part of which turned insolvent, and incremental growth from the acquisition need to be articulated by the company before investing in the stock. The stock trading at 28 times one-year forward earnings also captures the deal enthusiasm and the company prospects in the long term. Here is what the charts say about the shares of Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals, Inox Wind and Trent Nifty 50 (24,181) and Bank Nifty (50,787) depreciated 2.7 per cent and 2.5 per cent last week. The former posted a weekly loss for the fourth time in a row, indicating strong selling pressure. Here, we analyse derivatives data of both indices. The sharp decline on Friday has changed the outlook to negative for the stock of IndusInd Bank (₹1,041.60). Support levels are at ₹990 and ₹807. A close below the latter will even change the long-term outlook to negative. In the quarter ended September 2024, NTPC’s consolidated revenue from operations and EBITDA dipped around 8 per cent each year on year to ₹44,696.3 crore and ₹11,655.2 crore respectively. After the results announcement last Thursday post-market hours, the stock dropped 3 per cent on Friday. In fact, the shares of NTPC have corrected 11 per cent from its 52-week high of ₹443.2 recorded on September 30, 2024. However, on the back of strong tailwinds, BSE Power had a stellar run during the last 12 months, rising 80 per cent. NTPC too, in line, recorded a 72 per cent rise during the same period. Following Dusshera, the festival season peaks in the coming week, with Dhanteras and Diwali round the corner. As we start celebrating the festival of wealth and prosperity, gold continues to shine as a symbol of tradition. This year, the fireworks started early for gold investors with prices on a steady rise since the beginning of 2024. ‘ Wu ji bi fan’ as Jacki Chan says in Karate Kid, that is, when things reach an extreme, they can only move in the opposite direction. As did the IT stocks and Nifty IT Index after peaking in a frenzy in early 2022. However, in the last one year, they have attempted a strong recovery piggy-backing on the AI theme, and Nifty IT is now 6.5 per cent above the 2022 peak. It is not clear though if this will sustain. While recent Q2 results indicate the slowdown may have bottomed out, the pace of revenue growth still remains underwhelming. The National Stock Exchange (NSE) has relaxed the definition of what constitutes an inactive trading account. The period for marking an account as inactive has been changed from 12 to 24 months.

BlackRock and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) will invest in the $1.4 billion IPO, which will be the country’s second-biggest stock offering this year, the sources told Reuters. Here’s an interesting stock idea: The stock idea that we have for you today is Thermax. The stock has surged about 5 per cent on Friday breaking above key resistance on Friday. The price action indicates that a fresh leg of upmove has begun. The outlook is bullish and the share price can go up in the coming days. Check out the latest episode of bl.Today’s Pick to learn more. Last week we said that #Nifty can bounce back from its support around 24,400. But that view has gone wrong. The fall last week confirms a head and shoulder pattern on the chart. That leaves the danger of seeing more fall in the short-term. A short-lived recovery is also possible before another leg of fall happens. However, from a big picture there are good chances that we could be in the last leg of this correction. So, we expect the broader uptrend to resume after one more leg of fall from here. #Nifty can fall to 23,500-23,000 on a break below 23,900. After this fall, the overall uptrend can resume. #NiftyBank index can fall to 49,700-49,400 and then rise back to 51,000-52,000 again.

Investors purchase units of a new scheme at the face value of the units, which is typically ₹10. The short-term outlook for Thermax is bullish. The stock surged about 4.9 per cent on Friday and has closed on a strong note. This rise has taken the share price well above a key resistance level of ₹5,300. It also indicates that a new leg of upmove has begun. The level of ₹5,300 will now act as a good resistance-turned-support. Comments BACK TO TOP Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.
