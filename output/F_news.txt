Jillian Price, sister of Montana homicide victim Dustin Kjersem, spoke to Fox News Digital about the loss of her brother, the ongoing homicide investigation, and her plea to help investigators find a suspect. Almost three weeks after Montana father and avid outdoorsman Dustin Kjersem was found dead on a camping trip, police have identified a suspect in his "heinous" murder. The 35-year-old was found dead in his tent about two and a half miles up Moose Creek Road, near Big Sky on Saturday, Oct. 12. His friend who found him and called 911 initially believed he had suffered from a bear attack, but authorities quickly determined it was a homicide. While authorities have not yet released the name of the identified individual, the suspect is currently in custody on unrelated charges, Gallatin County Sheriff Dan Springer said in a media release. "It is believed the suspect acted alone and there is no longer a threat to the community," Springer added. "Further details and charges are forthcoming, but it is important for this community to know they are safe to resume their outdoor activities."

FOLLOW THE FOX TRUE CRIME TEAM ON X Some of the evidence listed in a prior press release that police said may have been taken from the crime scene include an Estwing camp ax, blue and silver, likely with a 26-inch handle; a Remington Model 11-87 12-gauge shotgun, wood stock; a Ruger Blackhawk .44 Magnum revolver, blued 4 5/8-inch barrel, wood grips; and an orange YETI Tundra 45 cooler. An autopsy showed that Kjersem sustained "multiple chop wounds, which led to his death," police said. OUTDOOR-LOVING FAMILY OF MAN KILLED IN TENT AFRAID TO CAMP WITH KILLER ON THE LOOSE In a prior press release, authorities asked for the public to help locate a blue and silver Estwing camp ax, which they believed was taken from the crime scene.

They have worked day and night for nearly three weeks with limited sleep, limited time with their families and limited time to themselves," Springer said in the release. "They have prioritized the safety of this community and the need to locate Dustin Kjersem’s killer above all else. It is this type of dedication that makes the Gallatin County Sheriff’s Office and all law enforcement officers special.

Major U.S. equities indexes were mixed on Tuesday. The technology and communication sectors outperformed ahead of a wave of marquee earnings reports, but other sectors including energy and utilities lost ground. The S&P 500 closed the session 0.2% higher. Tech sector strength helped the Nasdaq gain 0.8%, lifting the index to an all-time closing high. The Dow did not fare as well, slipping 0.4%. Shares of Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) surged 12.5% on Tuesday to notch the top daily performance of any S&P 500 stock after the electronic design automation firm posted better-than-expected quarterly results and boosted its full-year guidance. Revenue from the company's Cadence.AI portfolio, which builds generative AI and big data analysis into design processes, more than tripled year-over-year. Although Incyte (INCY) reported third-quarter profits that fell short of analysts' forecasts, the pharma company's revenue for the period exceeded expectations, and its shares jumped 12.0%. Incyte said both of its key products—cancer drug Jakafi and topical eczema treatment Opzelura—enjoyed strong demand and sales trends during the period. Application delivery company F5 (FFIV) delivered a quarterly sales and profit beat for its fiscal fourth quarter, and its shares jumped 10.1%. F5's CEO touted the company's transformation from its focus on hardware into a provider of security and software solutions better geared toward the current hybrid and cloud-based technological environment. Leidos Holdings (LDOS) shares added 9.5% after the IT services provider beat consensus estimates with its third-quarter sales and profit results. Strong bookings figures for the quarter also suggest that Leidos is poised for additional growth, and the company lifted its full-year outlook. Major U.S. defense contract wins contributed to the solid performance and upbeat forecast. Shares of tool manufacturer Stanley Black & Decker (SWK) tumbled 8.8%, the biggest drop in the S&P 500, in the wake of an underwhelming quarterly update. The company said weak demand from consumers and the auto industry pressured its performance, contributing to a quarterly sales and profit miss. Tuesday's decline sank Stanley Black & Decker into negative for 2024. Ford Motor (F) shares skidded on Tuesday, dropping 8.4% after the carmaker reported lower-than-expected third-quarter profits. Following the earnings miss, JPMorgan and Bank of America trimmed their price targets on Ford stock. However, analysts pointed to some reasons for optimism, noting that high warranty expenses contributed to the profit shortfall and highlighting the potential of the Ford Pro division. Homebuilder D.R. Horton (DHI) reported year-over-year declines in revenue and net income, falling short of estimates on the top and bottom lines. The company also issued lower-than-expected full-year sales guidance, indicating that it sees pressure from potential homebuyers holding out for lower mortgage rates. D.R. Horton shares fell 7.2%.

Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) report earning after markets close today; Ford (F) shares are sinking as the automaker reported third-quarter profit that was lower than expectation and cut its full-year outlook; McDonald's (MCD) shares are falling after same-store sales declined by more than estimates; and Boeing (BA) raises $21 billion as the machinists union strike continues. Here's what investors need to know today. Investors are anticipating the earnings report from Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) after markets close today, with analysts expecting the tech giant to post a third-quarter revenue jump of more than 12% year-over-year to $86.41 billion. Alphabet is also expected to report profit of $23.05 billion, or $1.85 a share, up from $19.69 billion, or $1.55 per share. Investors will also likely be watching for commentary from new Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Anat Ashkenazi, who took over the role in July. Shares of Alphabet are edging higher in premarket trading. McDonald's (MCD) shares are falling 2.5% in premarket trading after it reported mixed third-quarter results, with revenue of $6.87 billion and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $3.23 coming in better than estimates but net income of $2.26 billion and a same-store sales decline of 1.5% were worse than expected. McDonald's report comes as the company deals with an E. coli outbreak that caused it to briefly suspend Quarter Pounder sales in certain states. Shares of Ford (F) are down 6% in premarket trading after the automaker reported third-quarter profit that missed analysts' expectations and trimmed its full-year outlook. Ford's net income of $900 million, or 22 cents per share, declined from $1.2 billion, or 30 cents per share, last year and missed analysts' consensus estimates from Visible Alpha. The automaker said it expects full-year adjusted earnings of about $10 billion, compared to its previous projection of between $10 billion and $12 billion. Analysts are expecting to see significant earnings growth from Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) when the chipmaker reports third-quarter financial results after markets close today. Analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha expect the chipmaker to report revenue of $6.71 billion, up nearly 16% year-over-year, while the company's net income is projected to be $815.8 million, or 50 cents per share, more than double last year's $299 million, or 18 cents per share. The report comes as investors are watching the company's data center revenue, which the chipmaker doubled in its second-quarter report. AMD shares are up almost 1% in premarket trading. Boeing (BA) announced that it raised around $21 billion from sales of stock and depositary shares, coming as the troubled aerospace company looks to shore up its finances amid a costly strike by its machinists union. Boeing raised $15.81 billion after it sold 112.5 million common shares for $143 each, lower than the stock's price of $150.69 at Monday's close, and also brought in $4.91 billion from the sale of depositary shares. Shares of Boeing are 1% lower in premarket trading.

Title: Watch These Ford Price Levels as Stock Drops After Automaker Issues Soft Outlook

Shares in Ford (F) fell sharply in extended trading on Monday after the automaker posted third-quarter profit below Wall Street expectations and trimmed its full-year outlook amid ongoing high warranty costs, supply chain issues, and intensifying competition. CEO Jim Farley told analysts on the earnings call that the auto industry is in a global price war, driven by overcapacity and a flood of new electric vehicle (EV) companies. The Detroit-based automaker said its EV business lost $1.2 billion in the third quarter on sales of about 32,000 vehicles and booked a $1 billion charge to write down several EV-related manufacturing assets. Prior to Monday’s post-market fall, Ford shares had tumbled around 7% year-to-date Below, we break down the technicals on Ford’s weekly chart and discuss important post-earnings price levels to watch out for. Since bottoming out in early August, Ford shares have consolidated within an ascending triangle, a chart pattern that can signal a move lower if formed within an established downtrend, which is the case on the automaker’s chart. Indeed, the stock sits poised to test the pattern’s lower trendline after the company’s soft quarterly results, potentially opening the door for further post-earnings selling. The stock dropped 6% to $10.69 in after-hours trading Monday. Let’s analyze Ford’s chart to identify three key support levels that investors will likely be watching and point out a major overhead area worth monitoring. Upon a decisive breakdown below the ascending triangle, investors should monitor the $9.50 level. This location could attract buying interest near a trendline connecting a range of price action on the chart between August 2019 and this year’s early August low. A move lower could see the shares fall to around $8.70, an area where investors may seek entry points near a period of narrow consolidation in the second half of 2019, which also corresponds with the April 2021 pullback low. Ongoing selling could drive a bearish move down to the $7.50 region, where the stock would likely encounter support near the top trendline of a prior ascending triangle that formed on Ford’s chart in the months after the March 2020 pandemic low. If the stock makes a recovery, investors should keep a close eye on the $11.30 area, a level where shares may run into considerable overhead selling pressure near a trendline connecting multiple troughs dating back to January 2021. A volume-backed breakout above this major resistance could act as a catalyst for a bullish trend reversal.
