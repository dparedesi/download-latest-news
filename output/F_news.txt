Illustrations by Stephanie Lane Gage. The results of our seventeenth annual writers poll are in! Every year, we ask our contributors to program a fantasy double feature, placing one new release and one older film back to back, coaxing out subtle resonances or following a thread—of theme, genre, performance—through the years. We invite you to test out some of these inspired combinations for yourself over the holidays. (And see if you can spot the pairing that three of our contributors recommended, independently of each other.) If journalism is the first draft of history, maybe this feature can be the first draft of film culture to come. Here’s to another year of great cinema. Dylan Adamson Megalopolis (Francis Ford Coppola, 2024) + Pandora and the Flying Dutchman (Albert Lewin, 1951) From the nowhere-shore of the mind to the nowhere-horizon of the future, a boat casts off, possessed of a clarity of purpose that will be reserved from our view. Shaking off the accumulated dust of two thousand years of human culture, one of these films looks much better than the other. Ryan Akler-Bishop Megalopolis (Francis Ford Coppola, 2024) + Our Daily Bread (King Vidor, 1934) Two titans of narrative cinema self-fund their dream projects: both reckonings with the fantasy of American utopia, both box-office bellyflops, both sagas of charismatic figureheads—Men of the People—buckling beneath their ego and vice. Dreams of a collective future, burdens of individualist desire: Cesar Catilina, John Sims, Francis Ford Coppola, King Vidor. Mark Asch Slow Shift (Shambhavi Kaul, 2024) + The Clock (Christian Marclay, 2010) In her short Slow Shift, Kaul films the rocks of Hampi, India—both the ruins of the ancient capital of Vijayanagara and the boulder-strewn hills that surround it. The traces of a long-lost history, observed in Kaul's long takes and by a population of chattering monkeys, emphasize nonhuman time scales: the geological, the evolutionary, the cinematic. Is the film's vision prehuman or posthuman? Either way, the nine-minute Slow Shift is the opposite of the 24-hour The Clock, back at the Museum of Modern Art this winter, a supercut bound absolutely to the rhythms of industrial modernity. Paul Attard Carroll Gardens (Ernie Gehr, 2024) + Time Being (Andrew Noren, 2001) Definitive proof that old dogs can learn new tricks. Miriam Bale La chimera (Alice Rohrwacher, 2024) + Heat (Michael Mann, 1995) Flying and Driving: My pairing has less to do with similarities between two films (both are stone-cold masterpieces) and more to do with movie thoughts while in motion. My third viewing of Alice Rohrwacher’s La chimera was on an airplane. I didn’t want to use the airline headphones and forgot the cord for mine, so I watched with no sound. It was observing the adroit framing and movement isolated from plot and performances that confirmed to me it’s an all-time classic. One of the best films this year, decade, century. The night after seeing Heat introduced by Michael Mann—my first time watching it since moving to LA—I found myself driving an unusual route and ended up exactly where the final shootout was filmed, planes flying close overhead, Waingro’s Hilton hideout in sight. Mann’s film is one of the best LA films precisely for its emphasis on driving, both traffic on freeways and alternate routes. Heat helped me better see my own surroundings. Juan Barquin Castration Movie (Louise Weard, 2024) + The Plug Lady (Anthony Saladino, 2004) If it were possible to force every single trans person to watch both of these life-changing movies, I would. Saladino's work is an abject monstrosity; arguably one of the most misguided “trans films” to ever be made, and yet one I couldn’t look away from. You may very well spend weeks—nay, months—leaving your friends voicemails saying “This is the pluuuuuuuuuuug lady.” On the flip side: Louise Weard's Castration Movie is four and a half hours of what I believe trans cinema should look like. Genuinely lived-in from top to bottom, from cis to trans, it's a true “slice of life” (not unlike Imogen Binnie’s novel Nevada). Perhaps the characters will be off-putting, but they are painfully (and hilariously) real, and it's impossible not to feel at home around people joking about transmaxxing and how it's ableism to expect someone to read Dune. Also, only one of these two movies features a castration. Can you guess which one? Robert Barry The Substance (Coralie Fargeat, 2024) + Asparagus (Suzan Pitt, 1979) A shared fascination with bathrooms and their functions. Sam Bodrojan Challengers (Luca Guadagnino, 2024) + Pandora and the Flying Dutchman (Albert Lewin, 1951) Two otherwise minor directors, two laughably showy works of beautiful artifice, two ecstatically sad treatises on the sublimation of the self in the name of desire. Joshua Bogatin Megalopolis (Francis Ford Coppola, 2024) + The Palace (Roman Polanski, 2023) New Hollywood heaven and hell. Coppola tries to save humanity by harkening back to the classics and our sense of democratic purpose; Polanski pisses all over the entire Western world and shits the bed one last time. Two anti-masterpieces that straddle the line between incoherent and overly simplistic. The two movies that had me most questioning my own sanity and taste this year. At first glance, they both seem laughably bad from a technical standpoint, yet their staying power is immense. Coppola believes in a future where scientific progress and technocratic elites are capable of redeeming humanity. His vision of utopia looks like a cross between an Apple store, an erector set, and the plot of a 75-year-old dime-store paperback. Polanski depicts a decadent pre-Y2K past populated by gross elites farcically killing and fucking each other into the dawning of the new millennium. He ends the movie on a vulgar non sequitur, a throwaway bestiality joke that’s impressive far more for its bad taste than comedic value. The fact that it’s delivered by a man as repulsive as those he’s lampooning only increases the bad vibes and sleazoid factor. It was hard to find two other films that felt as startlingly contemporary this year, in no large part because of their many inanities and provocations. Yet in a year that felt dominated by depression, repulsion, and outrage you can guess which one felt more honest. Danielle Burgos Rumours (Guy Maddin, 2024) + Head (Bob Rafelson, 1968) Surreal, goofy swan songs (of the modern world and the Monkees) packed with stars utilizing and fighting tech and their pasts, traipsing toward each one’s only possible ending. Delightsome. Grace Byron Pollinator (Tourmaline, 2024) + The Giverny Document (Ja’Tovia Gary, 2019) Both films are impressionistic reads of history, illness, and love—though not always in the way one might expect. Ghosts hang heavy over gardens, fiction and archive become one. Both films are about historical Black figures and the way they creep into the present. Tourmaline invokes Marsha P. Johnson in a beautiful, kaleidoscopic short film that premiered at this year’s Whitney Biennial, perhaps one of the best things on view at the time. Gary’s film originated a few years earlier, though it also screened at the Museum of Modern Art this past spring. It's a staggering testament to Gary’s strength as a filmmaker—combining the gardens of Monet and Nina Simone with interviews with Black women on the street in Harlem about whether or not they feel safe. Who is allowed the fantasy of security? Of hope? Glitchy experimentation and surreal images of flowers overtake both films; by the end, one wakes from a dream. A warning, a talisman, a hypnotic spell. Celluloid Liberation Front Anora (Sean Baker, 2024) + The Black Marble (Harold Becker, 1980) Two touching films about all the beauty and tenderness Russians have brought to America in the doomed quest to humanize it. Amanda Chen The Shrouds (David Cronenberg, 2024) + Poison (Todd Haynes, 1991) —Jean Genet, Funeral Rites “How dark do you want to go?” Phil Coldiron “Anton Bruckner,” from Cycle XV of Eniaios (Gregory Markopoulos, 1947–91/2004–ongoing) + Overture (Stan Douglas, 1986) There are plenty of points of comparison and contrast—both involve cycles; both are built from alternations of light and dark (the photographic imagery in the “Bruckner” reels is sparse even in comparison to the rest of Eniaios, and its passages of clear leader are the longest I’ve seen in the eleven cycles so far, while Douglas appropriates Edison Film Co. footage of trains passing through Rocky Mountain tunnels); one concerns itself with an artist at the dawn of artistic modernism (Bruckner), the other with an artist from the apex of artistic modernism (Proust); one comes from the height of postmodernism, the other, when its decades-long premiere concludes the summer after next, might be taken as the end of cinematic modernism—but it was a line from Douglas that clicked things into place for me: “In a way my intention was to show European culture arriving in North America but not being able to deal with this new situation.” I suppose Eniaios is the grandest, the most gorgeous and deranged monument anyone has managed to build in the name of that “not being able to deal.” Adrian Curry The Beast (Bertrand Bonello, 2024) + Someone’s Watching Me! (John Carpenter, 1978) John Carpenter’s 1978 made-for-TV thriller (the best old film I saw for the first time this year) would pair nicely with one of my very favorite new films, or at least its central section. In both, a beautiful, gap-toothed blonde (Lauren Hutton in one, Léa Seydoux in the other), newly arrived in Los Angeles, lives alone in a place with too many windows and is stalked by a murderous stranger. The older film channels Hitchcock while the newer channels Henry James, but the similarities make you wonder if Bonello had the Carpenter film in mind. Robert Daniels Sometimes I Think about Dying (Rachel Lambert, 2024) + The Slender Thread (Sydney Pollack, 1965) It’s unfortunate that Rachel Lambert’s ruminative character study went largely unnoticed this year. As Fran, a lonely, socially awkward office worker whose suicidal ideations are beginning to get the best of her, Daisy Ridley is uniquely aching, especially when the unassuming Robert (Dave Merheje) arrives. Fran and Robert do go on a few cute, low-key dates. But Fran’s insecurities—intensified by the gloomy, remote Oregon surroundings—disrupt her potential happiness. In Sydney Pollack’s San Francisco–set directorial debut, Anne Bancroft is Inga, an unmoored mother in a marriage disrupted by a secret. In a dim motel room Inga ingests a bottle of pills and then calls a crisis helpline manned by an inexperienced student named Alan (Sidney Poitier). Like Lambert’s picture, The Slender Thread is about the overwhelming desire to feel a connection, and the power recognition can bring to those who feel invisible. Jon Dieringer The Firing Squad (Timothy A. Chey, 2024) + Shadow: Dead Riot (Derek Wan Man-Kit, 2006) Twenty years apart, two four-walled, low-budget films shot on garish HD video in abandoned prisons, one by born-again Christians, the other by likely Satanists. What Shadow: Dead Riot lacks in The Firing Squad’s star power (Sorbo, Gooding Jr., Roberts) it makes up for with the late Tony Todd–summoning hordes of undead criminals rising up against their former jailers. Flavia Dima Direct Action (Ben Russell and Guillaume Cailleau, 2024) + Milestones (Robert Kramer and John Douglas, 1975) A double-sided portrait of political struggle in the galvanizing heat of the moment and in its bitter, disillusioned aftermath. Writing this while Romania, my home country, is smack in the middle between the two, in the midst of an election cycle that seems to have set everything on fire (and has prompted the largest anti-fascist protests in the past century!) feels providential. Katarina Docalovich Cent Mille Milliards (Virgil Vernier, 2024) + Somewhere (Sofia Coppola, 2010) Unexpected familial connections are found between a tween girl and a desensitized man-child idly questioning his life choices in cities so immensely luxurious they consequently become alienating. In lieu of traditional plot structures, Coppola and Vernier both employ colorful flourishes, carefully arranged compositions, and fleeting snapshots to effectively capture existential disaffection with a surprising lightness. Katherine Franco An Odd Turn (Francisco Lezama, 2024) + Mahjong (Edward Yang, 1996) Two studies of two cities—Taipei, Buenos Aires—almost 30 years apart, but with the same concern: the value of the dollar. Where Edward Yang gives us Hard Rock Cafe, Francisco Lezama skips straight to the currency exchange center. Two invitations to attempt materialist history by way of comic form. Sasha Frere-Jones Foragers (Jumana Manna, 2024) + A Letter From Beirut (Jocelyne Saab, 1978) Soham Gadre Samsara (Lois Patiño, 2024) + Blue (Derek Jarman, 1993) Lawrence Garcia Misericordia (Alain Guiraudie, 2024) + La Maladie de Sachs (Michel Deville, 1999) Kaya Genç Anora (Sean Baker, 2024) + Pulp Fiction (Quentin Tarantino, 1994) As the credits rolled, I immediately wanted to rewatch Anora. Ani’s gesture of gratitude transformed into despair, and something resembling hope, and I was in tears. I savored the film’s aesthetic shifts between neorealism and Godfather-esque mafia movies. The home-invasion sequence is now part of film history; the search scenes reminded me of another Palme d’Or winner from the US, Quentin Tarantino’s Pulp Fiction—the car shooting, Winston Wolfe’s cleanup, the diner visit. Time flows so realistically in both films despite the outrageous plot twists and the artificiality of the worlds they depict. These are films to get lost in and enjoy as the world falls into darkness and madness in 2025. Annie Geng A Traveler's Needs (Hong Sang-soo, 2024) + Certified Copy (Abbas Kiarostami, 2010) Leonardo Goi Eephus (Carson Lund, 2024) + Last Night at the Alamo (Eagle Pennell, 1983) A gang of middle-aged amateur baseball players meet for one last match before their beloved field will be paved over and replaced with a new middle school. A crew of drifters and inveterate tipplers join forces for a final night of drinking before their favorite Houston dive will be torn down. These snapshots of soon-to-be-shuttered hangouts aren’t (just) tributes to some brick-and-mortar buildings, but to a certain way of being among others and looking at the world. Similarly receptive to the surreal and the unexpected, they show that wonder can exist within the claustrophobic tedium of small-town America—and the epiphany is nothing short of riveting. If either has escaped your radar, be sure to catch them—and while you’re at it, watch Pennell’s The Whole Shootin’ Match (1978), too. Peter Goldberg Megalopolis (Francis Ford Coppola, 2024) + Le Pont du Nord (Jacques Rivette, 1981) City films can be kinetic, symphonic, elegiac, poetic, epistolary. It’s rarer that they express the unnerving feeling of living in a world under construction. Coppola and Rivette take opposite approaches to the problem: give the city ever more elaborate dimensions or flatten it into a claustrophobic surface. Megalopolis is a work of unbalanced maximalism, bulldozing the senses by building ever larger in its search for a vague, tantalizing urban harmony. Romantic, autocratic Cesar looks down from on high, determined to tame not just space but time. Rivette’s method is horizontal, turning the city into a dangerous game. His heroines are marginal, thrown out of place by Paris’s centrifugal energy. They move through the city like tunnelers, not supposed to look at it from above. For them, someone else’s vision is a threat. The only answer is to tear out their eyes and keep moving. Caroline Golum She Is Conann (Bertrand Mandico, 2024) + A Feast of Man (Caroline Golum, 2017) Right before showtime I ran into fellow Spectacle comrade Zachary Fleming, who played James, the butler, in and was the assistant director of my first feature, A Feast of Man. Must’ve been kismet! Imagine my utter shock when I watched the final act of Conann, wherein (SPOILER ALERT!) our titular heroine informs a motley crew of artists that in order to inherit her fortune, they must agree to eat her dead body. If this sounds familiar, you may be one of twelve people who've seen my movie, in which a recently deceased playboy’s will stipulates that his closest friends do the same. Somewhere in the dark of the Courthouse theater, Zachary and I locked eyes. Was Mandico a secret Feast head? Or was this simply confirmation from the universe that microbudget filmmaking will always surf the avant-garde? We may never solve this mystery definitively, but I spent the better part of the next week feeling very “seen.” Emerson Goo Background (Khaled Abdulwahed, 2024) + Blessed Blessed Oblivion (Jumana Manna, 2010) When I initially watched Background, I found its minimalism too austere to connect with. But now I recognize in its deceptive simplicity the same tenderness and tension openly displayed in a film like Blessed Blessed Oblivion. Abdulwahed can’t hold his father’s hand, so he carefully cuts it out in Photoshop, lifting it from one photo to another. It’s an obsessive gesture against the dominion of the border and the time of captivity, like those performed by the hands on which Manna’s film fixates as they wash windows and pump iron. She depicts not only masculinity but also the objects it works over and through. In both films, the intensity of this attachment, and its ability to “transcend materiality” (Walid Daqqa), does not come automatically: it is cultivated through discipline. It’s fitting that the film that grew on me most this year, because I couldn’t stop thinking about it, taught me this. Jenna Ham Melody Electronics (Albert Birney, 2024) + Moonstruck (Norman Jewison, 1987) You're watching the “VCR” section of Albert Birney’s walkthrough of an imaginary video game called Melody Electronics. Soft and snowy synths fall on the soundtrack while a selection screen displays VHS covers from around 1988: Beetlejuice, Big.… And it’s Moonstruck that you (the player) pick to watch. “Good choice,” Melody says; then, pixelated Cher and Cage kiss on screen. During the credits, the NES-style moon rounds above (like a big pizza pie…). Both films are snowglobes: they orbit specific moments, to preserve the prettiness of a season. Moonstruck considers ancestry, lineage, ending on a portrait of family members from before the film’s story time, whilst Birney’s homely render of 1988 logs the ancestors of today’s electronics. To burrow, even to the near past, is a festive practice that celebrates the passing day; at the end of 2024, I was warmed by these two a lot. Jawni Han Juror #2 (Clint Eastwood, 2024) + The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (John Ford, 1962) Sometimes truth is not justice. When the legend becomes fact, print the legend. Sasha Han Melting Fire Iceman (Heesue Kwon, 2024) + The Dante Quartet (Stan Brakhage, 1987) Hellfire is the impetus for the meeting of these films. Consumed by Dante’s lyrics at a point of personal upheaval, Brakhage had come to see visions of hell. He applied them to 70mm film stock, using the aspect ratio of filmic epics past and present. If Brakhage directly expresses the traces of human intervention on the medium of film, Kwon's Melting Fire Iceman fuses analogue and generative AI technology to assert that the presence of the human is essential to facilitate the cinematic experience. As a cinema goes up in flames and the audience leaves, she turns her attention to the custodian workers of the theater who are left behind. In this emptiness, Kwon hauls her cinematic apparatus—projectors, Nipkow disks, a live camera, and an image-diffusion model appearing to hallucinate and dream—and herself as projectionist in front of the audience. While Kwon fiddles, manipulates, and operates the equipment, the hallucinations of AI reveal themselves as reflections, not of a sentient artificial intelligence but of the conductor of images herself. Eric Hynes Bird (Andrea Arnold, 2024) + The Butcher Boy (Neil Jordan, 1997) Films that are fully—formally and aesthetically—committed to the subjective points of view of adolescent protagonists who've been orphaned or abandoned. Spectral visions appear to both Francie and Bailey, each a divine witness summoned to redress the children’s invisibility. George Iskander Bye Bye Tiberias (Lina Soualem, 203) + Alexandria...Again and Forever (Youssef Chahine, 1989) Lina Soualem and her mother, Hiam Abbass, return to the latter’s village, Deir Hanna in occupied Palestine, to trace the stories of the women in their family: their expulsion from Tiberias, their lives in Deir Hanna, and their dreams of return. Set in 1987 during the Egyptian Actors’ Union strike, Youssef Chahine's autofictive Alexandria...Again and Forever follows his self-insert, Yehia, as he navigates a changing film industry, visions of the past, and dreams of the future. Motivated by their love of film, both Abbass and Chahine left home to pursue careers abroad—Abbass for Europe, Chahine for the United States. As they look back, nostalgia and sweetness intertwine with longing and regret: Abbass remarks again and again, “Don't open the gate to past sorrows,” and Chahine writes an elegy of a city that has become unfamiliar. To be Arab, in diaspora or exile, is to recount the past, again and forever. Pierre Jendrysiak The Curse S01E10: “Green Queen” (Nathan Fielder, 2024) + Cracking Up (Jerry Lewis, 1983) When I watched The Curse earlier this year, and especially this insane last episode, all I could think was: nothing has ever looked and felt like this. But then I gave it a thought and remembered my experience discovering all of the Jerry Lewis features during lockdown. They were just as surreal, strange, hilarious and awkward. They share a lot—not only this idiosyncratic “cringiness,” but something related to an altered experience of reality; a feeling of not belonging anywhere; a melancholy of slapstick; a radical, almost anarchic aesthetic; a strange relationship to Judaism and Jewish humor. For a double feature, I could only pick Cracking Up, Lewis’s final feature film, and probably his saddest. Jonah Jeng In a Violent Nature (Chris Nash, 2024) + Amer (Hélène Cattet and Bruno Forzani, 2009) Inverted slasher/giallo. In a Violent Nature invokes Jason Voorhees’s lakeside rampages, but here the camera closely tracks the mute killer as he lumbers through tranquil woodland, butchering hapless campers. Background becomes foreground; instead of residing largely offscreen and in the shadows per slasher tradition, the undead monster is the film’s enigmatic visual anchor. With Amer, an experimental remix of giallo iconography, texture and subtext become text. The roughness of fabric, the dampness of skin, the hotness of breath, the coldness of metal, the eroticism that emerges through this orgy of sensation—such aspects are visually and sonically amplified, igniting the senses and decentering more conventional plot beats and genre trappings. Kerosene Jones Love Lies Bleeding (Rose Glass, 2024) + BloodSisters: Leather, Dykes and Sadomasochism (Michelle Handelman, 1995) Two films about alternative forms of care and social reproduction against cis male domination and the medical industrial complex. Meditations on the liberatory potential of kink and the necessity of Sapphic violence. Body hacking. Bodies rendered illegible to hegemony. Killer music syncs. Pheromone-soaked deviations from homonormativity. People, places, and things that could be categorized as “bodacious.” Rachel Elizabeth Jones La chimera (Alice Rohrwacher, 2024) + Crumbs (Miguel Llansó, 2015) Melancholic, vaguely edged quests across landscapes animated by marginal living situations, busted train stations, and relics of negotiated value. Unseen forces distinctly at work, above and below—what good are human eyes? Radu Jude The Zone of Interest (Jonathan Glazer, 2024) + Auschwitz (Uwe Boll, 2011) Daniel Kasman Trap (M. Night Shyamalan, 2024) + The Spy in Black (Michael Powell, 1939) Murderers among us. Brandon Kaufman The Feeling That the Time for Doing Something Has Passed (Joanna Arnow, 2024) + Bad Girl (Frank Borzage, 1931) —Gillian Rose, Love’s Work Fareyah Kaukab The Exploding Girl (Jonathan Vinel and Caroline Poggi, 2024) + Notre-Dame de la Croisette (Daniel Schmid, 1981) Women longing for connection—each so distinctly tied to her era. From the 1980s to 2024, Candice erupts into her surroundings, her emotions imprisoned within her body, while Betty physically imposes herself on spaces where she is not allowed. Both stories use physical spaces to mirror their emotional turmoil. Leonard Krähmer The Periphery of the Base (Zhou Tao, 2024) + Coal Money (Wang Bing, 2009) With no discernible superstructure in sight, these two films must stick to the material(istic) world at hand: Zhou observes from afar how construction workers get lost in the dusty beige of the vast Gobi Desert (as the light fades, the camera joins in by disappearing into the grainy shadows); Wang, of course, stays much closer to his subjects to witness the heated price negotiations between fatigued lorry drivers who move coal from the Shanxi mines to the port of Tianjin. Coincidentally, both have a 53-minute runtime, which almost calls for them to be shown side by side, intensifying the already inherent layering effects. Kaitlyn A. Kramer Hors du temps (Olivier Assayas, 2024) + La chambre (Chantal Akerman, 1972) December's chill provides a nice excuse to find oneself in familiar interiors. Make room for nostalgia. Settle in. A double feature best seen at home. Elena Lazic The Devil's Bath (Veronika Franz and Severin Fiala, 2024) + The Seventh Victim (Mark Robson, 1943) Granted, this would be one of the most depressing double bills of all time. But besides their shared general theme (which I won’t spoil here), these two wonderful films are united by the unusual way they go about unveiling that theme, to stunning and devastating effect. Movies that find ingenious ways of revealing their hand—or, to put it more grossly, of dispensing information—are rare these days, but they’re the ones that tend to stay with me the most. Manuela Lazic About Dry Grasses (Nuri Bilge Ceylan, 2023) + Local Hero (Bill Forsyth, 1983) Two wonderful films about proud men having to move to an unfamiliar environment for work and hating the place initially, but then going through a humbling experience as their sense of self and their morality get challenged. Phuong Le Sanatorium under the Sign of the Hourglass (The Quay Brothers, 2024) + Double Suicide (Masahiro Shinoda, 1969) What do puppets dream of when they go to sleep? In the Quay Brothers’ latest, puppets, stop-motion animation, and live-action vignettes form an unearthly journey of reveries and nightmares. Among the various repetitions, the emphasis on capricious time devices suggests a temporal limbo and the futility of cheating fate. This sense of inevitability also looms in Masahiro Shinoda’s film, which reinterprets an eighteenth-century puppet play with live actors and expressionistic sets. As the walls close in on the doomed lovers—figuratively and literally—the film retains the tradition of kuroko, black-clad stagehands who silently reposition the scenery and stage props. Their reflexive movements absorb the invisible societal forces that animate the illicit romance. Like the traveler in Sanatorium, the unhappy couple in Double Suicide also head toward a predestined end. Through optical illusions rich in artifice, these films reveal the souls of their characters, using both traditional and modernist techniques. Dora Leu A Traveler’s Needs (Hong Sang-soo, 2024) + Haru (Morita Yoshimitsu, 1996) Idiots struggling to communicate is my favorite genre in cinema, as in life. Two films about language, love, and cinema, obsessed with communication on a formal level: the language of love, the language of cinema; love for language, love for cinema. About half of Haru’s runtime consists of written text on screen, and the best instance of zoom within Morita’s cinema deserves to be paired with a Hong. I also liked...the melodies.... Max Levin Rumours (Guy Maddin, Evan Johnson, and Galen Johnson, 2024) + I.K.U. (Shu Lea Cheang, 2000) Horny at the end of the world and at the beginning. Z. W. Lewis Henry Fonda for President (Alexander Horwath, 2024) + Film Emigration from Nazi Germany (Günter Peter Straschek, 1975) Non-Americans viewing America, making America, becoming America. Rebecca Liu Black Dog (Guan Hu, 2024) + John Wick (Chad Stahelski, 2014) Taciturn local man with a troubled past gets a new lease of life with a canine companion; mess with it at your peril. Chloe Lizotte Bogancloch (Ben Rivers, 2024) + Crank (Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor, 2006) Do everything. Slow down with Ben Rivers and Jake Williams in the Scottish Highlands: revel in the stillness and majesty of the natural world, trace the contours of Williams’s everyday routine, observe the delicate textures of light and natural fabrics, note a poignant rhyme between the decaying film grain and the ephemeral nature of mortality. Literally watch an uninterrupted take of Williams falling asleep in the woods, which prompted walkouts from the weak at the film’s Locarno premiere. Once you have the resting pulse of a marathon runner, Crank it back up to normal—then to dangerous. Jason Statham has been poisoned, and if he doesn’t want to die in an hour, he has to keep adrenaline coursing through his body, whatever it takes. He snorts loose cocaine off the ground. He shuts his hand in a hot waffle iron. He rapidly inhales and discards dozens of bottles of nasal spray while running around a hospital. In a sequence set to Harry Nilsson’s “Everybody’s Talkin’” (the rest of the film sounds like Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater), he jumps on top of the seat of his speeding motorcycle and spreads his arms wide, Christ-like, as he bombs down the streets of LA. If all of this weren't strange enough, Dwight Yoakam and Glenn Howerton both appear in supporting roles. Across a double-feature running time just one minute shy of three hours, you will feel like you have lived several lives and seen everything that the body can do. I hope you live to tell the tale. Ed Luker Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior (George Miller, 1981) + Oedipus Rex (Pier Paolo Pasolini, 1967) The displaced traverse the desert in search of a miraculous escape. Sex, violence, politics, secularization, and modernity: the thematic correspondences between Pasolini’s second historical epic and George Miller’s 1980s sci-fi dystopia are clear. Rex and Max, two tight-lipped anti-heroes, two scorched landscapes and the mobs struggling within them. I wasn’t a fan of George Miller’s Mad Max reboot. Like a video game, the logic was simple enough to hang a visual language around—but gimmicks prioritized franchise over storytelling. They go somewhere. They come back. So what? The passing of Fredric Jameson saw a handwritten list for his course “World Film: The Road Movie” circulating on social media. I was surprised, then, to see Miller’s Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior (1981) at the bottom, after Godard’s Weekend (1967). Miller’s sequel to his original is fantastic. The thematics of displacement and threat are conjured beautifully in a desert without direction. The wanderers are lost. The acts of theft and murder, ritual and prayer, in these wide-angled landscapes of skirmish reminded me of Pasolini’s Moroccan shots. Two films about sovereignty in the desert: the shift from a world of kings to one of leadership without authority. Ecocide and mob rule, road movies for when we’re rapidly running out of road. Carson Lund Evil Does Not Exist (Ryusuke Hamaguchi, 2023) + The Bed You Sleep In (Jon Jost, 1993) Having seen these two films within a week of one another by chance, I was struck by their remarkable similarities to the point of speculating on the possibility that Hamaguchi—a newly crowned Oscar winner who’s quite clearly ambivalent about the honor—might have found direct influence from a fellow filmmaker in voluntary exile from the fanfare of the United States. Set in an Oregon logging community, Jost’s earlier film is a rumination on rape in its environmental and human forms, a caustic and angry work that recognizes that tackling the complexity of such uncomfortable topics cannot be approached from a single expressive mode, and correspondingly vacillates between rigorous documentary observation, Bergmanesque chamber drama, scenes of stilted monologuing that recall the work of Straub-Huillet, and passages of psychedelically inflected structuralist cinema. Threading it all together is a plaintively beautiful modern classical score by Erling Wold that seems to exist on a plane above the action. In a moment of escalating tension near the film’s end, Jost layers a Wold piece over the duration of an image of trees reflected on the windshield of a moving car, a shot that runs long enough to achieve drone-like intensity, redirecting the mounting dramatic stakes toward an attentiveness to the indifferent, but nonetheless vulnerable, natural world. A similar shot functions as a prelude to Hamaguchi’s thorny follow-up to Drive My Car (2021), another formally shape-shifting parable about the deleterious effects of human actions on the land we occupy. In this case, Eiko Ishibashi’s taut, string-laced music overscores a protracted dolly shot focused on the tops of trees in a forest outside Tokyo, the site of both a small rural community and a cynical startup company’s planned glamping business. The shot is echoed at the end of the film when the film’s hitherto muted conflicts unexpectedly explode to a point of violent catharsis—a dramatic pattern discernible in Jost’s film as well. In resorting to such extravagant narrative crescendos, both filmmakers argue that the latent but omnipresent tensions in our modern landscape between nature and human actions—simmering for the most part below the surface to all but the most conscientious ecologists and artists—may only achieve a semblance of resolution suddenly and brutally. At first, I was taken aback by gestures that appeared to be out of tune with the overarching contemplation of both films, and in hindsight, I’m in awe of the political gravity faced head-on by Jost and Hamaguchi. Both films are like boulders hurled into the placid surface of a pond. Saffron Maeve Stress Positions (Theda Hammel, 2024) + Next Stop, Greenwich Village (Paul Mazursky, 1976) Zoé Maghamès Peters Outrun (Nora Fingscheidt, 2024) + American Honey (Andrea Arnold, 2016) Carly Mattox Kneecap (Rich Peppiatt, 2024) + Song of Granite (Pat Collins, 2017) Kneecap begins at breakneck speed, with narrator Liam Óg Ó Hannaidh (known by his stage name Mo Chara, as member of the titular hip-hop group) declaring: “You know what? Every fucking story about Belfast starts like this.” Cue a montage of car bombs and gunfire, emblematic images of the Troubles. It was tempting, of course, to pair Kneecap with such a film—In the Name of the Father (1993) came to mind, as well as Hunger (2008), with Steve McQueen’s latest currently in awards consideration. However, I’ve gone with Pat Collins’s Song of Granite (2017), about the Connemara-born folk musician Joe Heaney who specialized in traditional sean-nós singing. The films are aesthetic opposites—where Kneecap is explosive and orgiastic, Song of Granite is patient and unassuming—yet both are concerned with the preservation of Irish language through music, as much as the respective protagonists’ own complicated relationships to the land of their fathers. Stephanie Monohan April (Déa Kulumbegashvili, 2024) + Under the Skin (Jonathan Glazer, 2013) Both feature women who spend a lot of time driving, luring strange men into their car with the suggestion of an anonymous sexual encounter, as well as (spoiler alert) a strange alien-human life-form wandering the liminal space of an inky black pool. However, I was more struck by the unique sense of dread I felt watching these movies. While their protagonists are very different—an extraterrestrial who entraps men in Scotland and delivers them to her home planet vs. an OBGYN trying to provide safe abortions in rural Georgia—both films articulate a kind of female isolation, and the vulnerability that comes from inhabiting a body that is banal one moment and a site of intense danger the next; danger that can come from pregnancy and childbirth, at the hands of violent men, or with punishment by the state. Alexander Mooney Megalopolis (Francis Ford Coppola, 2024) + Winter Kills (William Richert, 1979) Young idealist against an unfeeling world (featuring old man yells at cloud). Victor Morozov Merman (Ana Lungu, 2024) + Alix's Pictures (Jean Eustache, 1980) On the abusive tenderness of showing someone an image. Adam Nayman Longlegs (Oz Perkins, 2024) + In the Dark (Clifton Holmes, 2000) Cryptic missives left lying around in envelopes are a staple of horror movies, but not all correspondence is created equal. Where the letters in Longlegs prove to be red herrings (the only item on Oz Perkins’s conceptual menu) the anonymous instructions guiding cash-strapped Kim Garrett through Clifton Holmes’s millennial SOV masterwork In the Dark (now available on YouTube) communicate the sadistic, Simon-says sensibility of a gig economy predicated on a willing and profit-motivated enslavement. Perwana Nazif Caught by the Tides (Jia Zhangke, 2024) + Neige (Juliet Berto and Jean-Henri Roger, 1983) Andrew Northrop The Land at Night (Richard Tuohy and Dianna Barrie, 2024) + Razor Blades (Paul Sharits, 1968) Maxwell Paparella A Different Man (Aaron Schimberg, 2024) + The Face Behind the Mask (Robert Florey, 1941) When gobs of Edward’s misshapen flesh melt away to reveal Sebastian Stan, he fakes his death and becomes a real estate agent. Peter Lorre’s Janos has a better excuse for turning to a life of crime: he’s saving up for a new face of his own. Both films wind their way through the parks, theaters, and doctor’s offices of Manhattan toward deliciously tragicomic conclusions about the specious appeal of hopes and dreams. Nicolas Pedrero-Setzer Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes (Wes Ball, 2024) + Bye Bye Monkey (Marco Ferreri, 1978) There’s nothing surprising about the fact that people are drawn to the myths, ideas, and architecture surrounding the Roman Empire as the world embraces militarism, machismo, and authoritarianism. Before Trump issued the “Executive Order on Promoting Beautiful Federal Civic Architecture,” Hitler promoted “Starved Classicism.” The attention Wes Ball awards to the Roman Empire is curious for a film that takes place beyond human history; it suggests that the Planet of the Apes will mirror the Planet of the Humans—a tragedy. In Bye Bye Monkey, an electrician who works at a Roman-themed waxwork museum adopts a baby chimpanzee. The museum, with all its classical idols, goes up in flames. After Ferreri showed 1970s audiences that historical paradigms were meant to burn so primates could fashion new futures for themselves, it’s sad to see Ball regress. Cici Peng The Ballad of Suzanne Césaire (Madeleine Hunt-Ehrlich, 2024) + India Song (Marguerite Duras, 1975) Two films about the impossibility of representation performed self-consciously, reflexively, and delicately by their respective lead actresses: Zita Hanrot and Delphine Seyrig. Both contend with the impossibilities of bringing back the past in very different colonial contexts—for Duras, it was impossible to represent her memory of Indochina through a “political film,” a form and framework that she detested. She questioned how a film about a factory worker could possibly show the horror and the disorienting otherness at the same time. Suzanne Césaire destroyed her own writing. As Hanrot proclaims, “We are making a film about someone who does not want to be remembered.” Both filmmakers reject the premise of simply “rediscovering” these women. Instead, they play with forms of opacity and question the obfuscating power of the visible. The splendor of the luscious gardens in Hunt-Ehrlich’s film and the opulent mansion in Duras’s slowly but seductively reveal the disastrous implications of such beauty. Andréa Picard Misericordia (Alain Guiraudie, 2024) + Her Venetian Name in Deserted Calcutta (Marguerite Duras, 1976) With its icy Milanese bourgeois family undone by Terence Stamp’s divine sex appeal, Pasolini’s Teorema (1968) would obviously make a great double bill with Guiraudie’s erotic pastoral thriller, but the restoration of a rarely screened, almost mythical film by Duras rouses corresponding sensations involving ghosts, trespasses, longing and desire, dampness, uncertain returns, and invocations. Tonally like night and day, yet both unearth yearning as irrepressible energy transcending death. Adam Piron Here (Robert Zemeckis, 2024) + Enter the Void (Gaspar Noé, 2009) Both Zemeckis and Noé are known for their elaborate technical experiments that act as their own kind of ballyhoo, but I think these examples of their work are actually wrestling with parallel and seemingly personal anxieties through similar formal gambles. They’re both exercises in fixed perspectives, duration, and non-traditional editing techniques that meditate on displacement, death, and bitterness. You gotta take the shot with the chaser, but I’ll leave it up to the viewers to decide which is which. Olivia Popp Toxic (Saulė Bliuvaitė, 2024) + Naissance des pieuvres (Céline Sciamma, 2007) One grimy summer, two teen girls out of place for different reasons. A codependent girlhood friendship runs amok in these distinct films with fascinatingly similar elements: body dysmorphia, compulsory heterosexuality and its dire overarching consequences, riding two-up on a bicycle, teen bodies injuriously sized up, a sloppy exploratory kiss, uncomfortable moments in locker rooms, underwater swimming sequences, taking public transit together toward an inevitably grim encounter with a much older man, an electronic score, overly stylized intercut dance scenes, mostly absent adults. Rachel Pronger The Outrun (Nora Fingscheidt, 2024) + Blue Black Permanent (Margaret Tait, 1992) A woman gazes out to sea as a storm brews, a dot amongst craggy rocks, waves crashing, winds howling…. The Outrun and Blue Black Permanent are two cine-poems which (largely) sidestep romantic stereotypes to offer rugged but still magical portraits of the Orkney Islands. Both are abstracted autobiographies authored by women with strong ties to the archipelago (Tait, who made her feature film debut at 74 with Blue Black Permanent, and Amy Liptrot, who wrote the book and cowrote the screenplay for The Outrun). Subsequently, both films are rooted by a local’s eye for specificities, channeling the wild majesty of this unique terrain to illustrate the turbulent subjectivities of complicated heroines. These are also two films about generational trauma and an inheritance that may run deeper than human bloodlines—into the birds, into the sea creatures, into the rocks of that brutal coastline, into the vast emptiness of the pitch-black Orcadian night. Caitlin Quinlan The Shrouds (David Cronenberg, 2024) + An Empty Dream (Yu Hyun-mok, 1965) The erotics of the dental surgery. Thomas Quist The Shrouds (David Cronenberg, 2024) + The Mouth Agape (Maurice Pialat, 1974) That empty signifier—“spiritual sequel”—might actually apply here. Two films united by their exploration of death through the driving impulse of cinema: to give an image to the imageless. But both have shots at the end—each a kind of fleeing away—that suggest the impossibility of death being caught alive by film. Rather, these shots both express the sense that perhaps all cinema can offer (following Jean-Luc Nancy’s belief) is evidence that life goes on. Lucía Requejo Solo qu3r3mos un poco de amor (Raúl Perrone, 2024) + Breve cielo (David José Kohon, 1969) For me, it’s always “boy meets girl.” It doesn’t, but if that formula lacked something, it would be the third presence of the most uncontrollable scenario there is: a city. Cities allow us to create a world within the world, to escape from ourselves, to become strangers, while simultaneously forcing us to let our bodies be affected by the other. Fifty-five years set these two Argentinian films apart, but not much has changed about how to make the city one’s own, whether it’s Buenos Aires or Ituzaingó. Through walking, feeling, and asking questions, even for those who have little or nothing, there is still a way to create a world of its own: by falling in love. Vadim Rizov Grand Tour (Miguel Gomes, 2024) + Lost Horizon (Frank Capra, 1937) It makes sense to pair another soundstage spectacular with my Movie of the Year, and thanks to recent restorations, it’s Capra season. I actually haven’t seen Lost Horizon yet—one of his few big ones I haven't gotten to—so this is a note to myself on how to finish the year. Hopefully the pairing works! Julian Ross exergue - on documenta 14 (Dimitris Athiridis, 2024) + The Thick of It (Armando Iannucci, 2005–12) Robert Rubsam Harvest (Athina Rachel Tsangari, 2024) + Nostalghia (Andrei Tarkovsky, 1983) The death of a world as a death of the world. Nothing persists, everything flows, but (for a few hours) art can bring it back. Nicholas Russell Trap (M. Night Shyamalan, 2024) + A History of Violence (David Cronenberg, 2005) Similar elements don't necessarily yield similar results. Shyamalan’s work opens out onto a host of different cinematic influences and parallels, and various elements of Trap reminded me of a range of serial-killer/family dramas. In the end, I found myself going back to A History of Violence for the way its common threads with Trap are inverted: The patriarch who leads a double life, in one film embracing his violent nature and in the other trying as hard as possible to hide it. The family destroyed yet paradoxically united by the consequences of the father’s terrible actions. Too, aesthetically, Shyamalan tempers his serial killer’s violence into a matter of narrative backstory rather than rampant onscreen brutality, a thwarted expectation juxtaposed with Cronenberg’s shocking, realistic gore in this early-aughts period that, inclusive of Eastern Promises (2007), utilizes Viggo Mortensen as a reluctant cipher. Rafa Sales Ross A Want in Her (Myrid Carten, 2024) + No Home Movie (Chantal Akerman, 2015) Mothers and daughters and tentative kitchen conversations. Sophia Satchell-Baeza Direct Action (Ben Russell and Guillaume Cailleau, 2024) + Milestones (Robert Kramer and John Douglas, 1975) —Paul Éluard Dan Schindel Coreys (Dan Streit, 2024) + Mulholland Drive (David Lynch, 2001) Within the bewildering miasma of modern life, the distance between yourself and a performed persona becomes negligible. Is that other self even a performance, or your dream? Which one is the real you? Is either? Everything solid melts into data, while data congeals into reality. Zach Schonfeld Between the Temples (Nathan Silver, 2024) + Hester Street (Joan Micklin Silver, 1975) Carol Kane's filmography is currently bookended by two wonderful, mordantly funny films about what it means to retain or rediscover your Jewishness in America in the 2020s and 1890s, respectively. Both, coincidentally, by directors with the surname Silver. David Schwartz Megalopolis (Francis Ford Coppola, 2024) + Intolerance (D. W. Griffith, 1916) Grand artistic statements and time-hopping historical spectacles whose genius directors spared no expense, Griffith’s Intolerance was released during the Great War, and Coppola’s years-in-the-dreaming Megalopolis emerged during our present apocalypse. This exhilarating and mind-numbing double feature is not exactly a fantasy; real-life time-and-space hopping presented it to me this May, when I traveled from Cannes—where Coppola’s eagerly anticipated film opened and fizzled—to Rochester, where Intolerance was the opening-night film at the Nitrate Picture Show. Though there was much to admire and enjoy in Megalopolis, its sheer inanity and caricatured characters were deflating. Not only did Griffith’s film hold up much better, it was also much more interesting, especially in its depiction of women. Coppola gave us Aubrey Plaza’s Wow Platinum, but Griffith offered a multitude of complex and contradictory women (“the inhumane spinster, the perverse old queen, the bereft mother, the charity girl, the adulteress, and the prostitute,” as Miriam Hansen listed in a Film Comment essay), and they are the key players in all of the film’s pivotal moments—to the extent that even Jesus Christ feels like a marginal character. As Hansen wrote in 1989, “Intolerance remains Griffith’s most modern film, a film that projects its contradictions forward into our time.” Wow indeed. Pedro Emilio Segura Bernal Direct Action (Ben Russell and Guillaume Cailleau, 2024) + Milestones (Robert Kramer and John Douglas, 1975) Jacques Rivette wrote about Nicholas Ray’s work as follows: “And the real struggle takes place in only one of them, against the interior demon of violence, or of a more secret sin, which seems linked to man and his solitude.” Serge Daney said this about Milestones: “Nothing to see (as said to a crowd to move them away from an accident: there is nothing to see)—nothing in common—nothing to look at. The heterogeneity of the images disregards suture, and off-screen space, that reserve fund of perceptions. An omnipresent camera, continuous speaking, are there for real, and from this—the pattern woven from them—there is no way out. Likewise for the collective, there is nothing to see, nothing to meet. No one sees it and it sees no one.” These texts not only speak about the films they were written for but also resonate deeply with their counterparts. These masterpieces are about heritage, radicality...but more importantly about beauty and despair. Dash Shaw Chicken for Linda! (Chiara Malta and Sébastien Laudenbach, 2024) + Windy Day (Faith & John Hubley, 1968) Two bright, bouncy, airy cartoons with voice performances that are a breath of fresh air. Voices so real and refreshing in contrast to the shouty, annoying voice acting heard in most animations. Both are made by couples. Love! Chris Shields Rumours (Guy Maddin, Evan Johnson, Galen Johnson, 2024) + The Poseidon Adventure (Ronald Neame, 1972) Both films play out their dire disaster narratives inside little worlds. In Rumours, the nighttime forestscape where its action is set is psychically insular, created with light and darkness and the knowledge that everyone else has seemingly disappeared. In The Poseidon Adventure, Hackman and his gang of survivors traverse an obstacle course-cum-“Wonderland” in the bowels of a capsized cruise ship. Dream logic (or at least dream scenarios) prevails explicitly and implicitly in both. They are true and strong works of fantasy cinema in that they approach their imaginative and surreal conceits with the one-foot-in-front-of-the-other pragmatism that photographic art makes possible. Superficially, Rumours appears to riff on Poseidon, essentially parodying Irwin Allen’s blockbuster disaster film formula, but at their core, their missions are the same. The limited horizons their chosen scenarios impose serve to only heighten the intensity of their emotional drama. Their settings become a jungle gym for children at play as we watch them create a collective fantasy. Michael Sicinski Eight Postcards from Utopia (Radu Jude and Christian Ferencz-Flatz, 2024) + Kubasa in a Glass: The Strange World of the Winnipeg Television Commercial (1975–1993) (Matthew Rankin and Walter Forburg, 2006) You can look at these two films as different volumes from the same essential project: a cultural history derived from a close analysis of industrial media detritus. The more distance we gain from these artifacts, the more painfully the reveal a nation's neuroses. See also: An Image (Harun Farocki, 1983); Poetry and Truth (Peter Kubelka, 2003); The Exquisite Corpus (Peter Tscherkassky, 2015). Josh Slater-Williams I Saw the TV Glow (Jane Schoenbrun, 2024) + A Snake of June (Shinya Tsukamoto, 2002) There is still time to become the person you're afraid to reveal. Christopher Small Jawan (Atlee Kumar, 2023) + Princess Mononoke (Hayao Miyazaki, 1997) Now that I’ve been submitting these double-feature ballots for more than a decade, I hope I’ve earned enough credit from you, dear reader, to forgive the indulgence of this year’s pairing. The two movies I have picked simply stand in for the year’s most significant cine-events for me personally. First, Indian superstar Shah Rukh Khan’s latest gonzo mega-hit, for spending a day and a half in the presence of the man himself in Locarno, going from a photoshoot to a lunch to the introduction to Devdas (2002). For the other SRK-heads out there, you can perhaps imagine how mind-blowing that whole experience was, also for seeing the workings of unimaginable fame up close. And second, Miyazaki's masterpiece, for my once-in-a-lifetime trip to Yakushima, the island off the coast of Japan that inspired it. Both movies—Atlee’s and Miyazaki’s—are audience-friendly, left-ish political epics involving peasant uprisings, about heroic figures partnering with mythic forces to do battle against the extractive elites whose power ensnares a population. Miyazaki’s is certainly the more artful of the two, his totalizing vision bringing every flutter of an arrow, every quiver of a blade of grass, every chirp of a forest creature to life (and it was the first Studio Ghibli film to blend hand-drawn animation with computer-generated imagery). As I hiked and drove through the forests of Yakushima, these images were with me in my mind’s eye, as Joe Hisaishi’s soundtrack was in my ear. The landscape was freighted with extra significance as I imagined Miyazaki making the same treks, conceiving of Mononoke’s images. Jawan is, let’s say, complementary to Miyazaki’s exacting artistry in that it has little time for niceties of form or craft. Unusually for SRK, it was directed by a Tamil filmmaker, Atlee, who brings a welcome vulgarian-populist madness to the proceedings. As with all the best Indian blockbusters, Jawan is six or seven movies smushed into one, each with its own moral philosophy and genre conventions to play with: the fun is in seeing all of them rub shoulders in such gloriously entertaining fashion. Laura Staab Emit a Beam, See a Light (Amy Halpern, 2022) + The Leaden Echo and the Golden Echo (Margaret Tait, 1955) I kept thinking about a book by Anahid Nersessian this year, often returning to what she has to say about beauty in times of misery. She writes that “finding things to call beautiful” in these times “is indefensible,” but we do, all the same, because that is living. And I found things to call beautiful in these two films by Amy Halpern and Margaret Tait. Images of women’s faces, illuminated in warm sunlight—yet seeming, simultaneously, to emit a beam entirely of their own—left me rhapsodic, despite everything. Hannah Strong Queer (Luca Guadaganino, 2024) + Love Is The Devil (John Maybury, 1998) Transactional romance, artistic license, queerness, addiction—and Daniel Craig as the beating, drug-addled heart of it all. Elissa Suh Vulcanizadora (Joel Potrykus, 2024) + End of Night (Keith McNally, 1990) Savage meditations on the realities and pressures of fatherhood. Juvenile regression as a means to avoid responsibility. Scout Tafoya Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga (George Miller, 2024) + Wild Boys of the Road (William Wellman, 1933) Depression era fables, tough guys, tomboys, bad cops, lost limbs. “There’s no hope here!” The past and the future caught up to each other. Drag race over, no winners. Matthew Thrift Hard Truths (Mike Leigh, 2024) + Cracking Up (Jerry Lewis, 1983) “Warren, when did you first notice you were…a misfit?” the psychiatrist asks Jerry Lewis’s depressed putz in Cracking Up. He might ask the same of Marianne Jean-Baptiste’s Pansy, the rancorous centre of Mike Leigh’s Hard Truths. Here’s a pair of films that seem to literalize Edward Said’s characterization of late style as being suffused with intransigence and difficulty: two venomous comedies—in the oldest sense of the term—that revolve around the parade of self-manifested indignities suffered by their respective protagonists. Lewis’s film begins with a thwarted suicide attempt and ends with him dousing himself in gasoline. A running joke sees him repeatedly punched in the face. For the irredeemably paranoid Pansy, even the affections of her nearest and dearest are weaponized and booby-trapped. If Leigh counterpoints the chaos of Pansy’s worldview with the gentle empathy of his camera, such separation is impossible for Lewis’s masochistically ungovernable director-star. A discordant symphony of self-flagellation, Lewis’s final masterwork flips the bird to Chaplin’s wounded suggestion in Limelight (1952) that the world might be through with clowns. Katie Tobin Anora (Sean Baker, 2024) + Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (Chantal Akerman, 1975) In which we follow sex workers navigating the monotony of their daily lives, desperate to escape the routines that both define and constrain them. Matene Toure Soundtrack to a Coup d'Etat (Johan Grimonprez, 2024) + Lumumba (Raoul Peck, 2000) Matt Turner Werckmeister Capybaras (@bartlebooth45, 2024) + Capybaras Walking (Eadweard Muybridge, 1887) An Electro Photographic Investigation of Consecutive Phases of Animal Movements. Amalia Ulman Afternoons of Solitude (Albert Serra, 2024) + The Moment of Truth (Francesco Rosi, 1965) In 1960s Spain there was a subgenre of movies akin to those made for rockstars (like The Beatles’ HELP!, 1965) but about bullfighters because they were the rockstars of Francoist Spain. Most of these films were insufferable propaganda vehicles but The Moment of Truth got away with a grittier neorealist style due to the fact that it was a foreign production. While both films follow real matadors, The Moment of Truth shows us the historical context of a bullfight, the backstory of its protagonist and the behind the scenes of an industry run by greedy managers, while Afternoons of Solitude is an intimate portrait of both the bull and the matador in the arena during the nerve-wracking moments directly before, during, and after a corrida. Carlos Valladares Marianne (Michael Rozek, 2023) + Abigail's Party (Mike Leigh, 1977) Two anti-Hollywood masterpieces in which a living room opens up as a space for a new possible relation between the self and his family, the self and her society. Leigh has been a major, unfurling discovery for me this year, particularly his BBC work, and this bitter-couples-fighting chamber piece (better than Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, 1966) keeps finding thrilling ways to show how our convenience devices, our passive-aggression, our unhappiness with the way things are (in 1970s England or today) has kept us frighteningly limited in our thinking. Under Rozek's direction, Isabelle Huppert provides a possible expansion to that thinking; she gives, alongside her other equally stunning performance in Hong Sang-soo's A Traveler’s Needs (2024), probably her quintessential performance. And in Marianne—a fresh-feeling, sly, lovely single-hander—she cheerfully sends up the very notion of characters, narrative propulsion, and relatability that Hollywood convinces us is necessary. I feel closer to people after seeing Leigh's work and Marianne. Winnie Wang Lázaro at Night (Nicolás Pereda, 2024) + Isabella (Matías Piñeiro, 2020) K. F. Watanabe Israel Palestine on Swedish TV 1958–1989 (Göran Hugo Olsson, 2024) + Red Army / PFLP: Declaration of War (Masao Adachi and Koji Wakamatsu, 1971) Not a particularly inspired pairing, but it's not been an inspiring year. Maybe next year, God willing. C. Mason Wells Ricky Stanicky (Peter Farrelly, 2024) + Switch (Blake Edwards, 1991) High-concept hijinks, high art. Blake Williams Twisters (Lee Isaac Chung, 2024) + cinéma concret (Takashi Makino, 2015) Two expansions of cinema, in 4DX (Chung) and Pulfrich 3D (Makino), both signaling a return to a primal cinema, both resulting in a dimensional vortex of whirling matter, memories, and mayhem that asks us to feel as though we’re inside the movie while implicitly reminding us of the great relief and tragedy that we'll never be in it for real. Andrew Norman Wilson www.RachelOrmont.com (Peter Vack, 2024) + Analife (Goda Kenji, 2005) A glib summary may leave one with the impression that these makers are antisocial edgelords, and that this pairing is the work of yet another. But both works confronted me with surprising emotional reckonings that, while bleakly reflecting and exaggerating the ways in which media environments capitalize on the lossy compression of emotions into data, also offer visions of escape. That may sound like a Black Mirror episode with a cathartic finale, but Vack and Goda are perceptive enough to understand that, in terms of form, degenerate times call for degenerate measures. If Analife is like getting locked inside the fetish porn room at a sex shop in which an array of screens are stuck on looping DVD menus, www.RachelOrmont.com is like getting airdropped into a memelord's phone. Both offer ways out—Goda leads his trio into the forest, while Vack releases his protagonist (played brilliantly by his sister, Betsey Brown) onto the street. What's so profound about Vack's film is the aesthetic and emotional expansion that unfurls once Rachel is decoupled from the dopamine machine, and what's so heartbreaking is that she can't fathom anything beyond jacking back into it. Madeleine Wulfahrt Anora (Sean Baker, 2024) + Klute (Alan J. Pakula, 1971) Two very different sex-work sagas in two very different New Yorks, both of which somehow manage to dodge the bullet of overt moralization. Watch in chronological order for cinematic gentle-giant progression: from Donald Sutherland's Klute, to Yura Borisov's Igor. Keva York Coreys (Dan Streit, 2024) + Dream a Little Dream (Marc Rocco, 1989) Two tales of two Coreys, a dissociation double feature. Genevieve Yue The Substance (Coralie Fargeat, 2024) + Mediums (James N. Kienitz Wilkins, 2017) Pick me: being chosen can feel like the hand of fate (Elisabeth’s car crash and subsequent encounter with a Substanced nurse) or getting caught in the rusty gears of democracy (potential jurors milling outside a courthouse). In both cases, there’s much to learn, and even more instruction on offer: at-home medical procedures, ass-boosting squats, franchising a Dunkin’ Donuts, French cooking, selecting an insurance plan. After what happens for the sake of, let’s face it, a pretty dull and repetitive job in The Substance, jury duty doesn’t seem so bad after all. Kit Zauhar Trap (M. Night Shyamalan, 2024) + A Man Escaped (Robert Bresson, 1956) I feel as though this is obvious for many reasons, haha! I was pretty obsessed with A Man Escaped in college after watching it in a film class, and was also pretty obsessed with Trap after seeing it in Philly in the old Ritz Theatre with a mouse scuttling around that scared the bejesus out of me every few seconds. I just find watching a character work through the epiphany of an escape plan in real time so deeply satisfying, so why not do it twice?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. At every turn of the road, GM chair and CEO Mary Barra has reinforced the mantra that 2024 was the "year of execution." Barra and her team made good on that promise to investors who were yearning for better returns, ultimately earning the auto icon the 2024 Yahoo Finance Surprise of the Year award. "There's been a lot of change. We're an industry in transformation and GM itself is in the midst of making sure we're ready and proactive for the changes that are coming," Barra told Yahoo Finance in an exclusive sitdown. Tightening the grips on EV losses and making better-received cars have paid off for GM. Read More: Why Walmart won Yahoo Finance's Company of the Year award The company lifted its profit guidance each time it reported earnings in 2024, powered by strong adoption of new crossover models, such as the Chevy Trax and the Cadillac Lyriq EV, and savvy cost cuts. GM used its improving cash position to repurchase $2.4 billion in stock year to date, more than double the pace compared to one year ago. It's sent a clear signal that despite expensive investments in EVs and a costlier UAW deal inked in 2023, Barra and her team think the stock is an attractive long-term buy. Shares of GM charged to a 47% advance this year, outperforming the 14% drop for rival Ford (F), which has struggled on product quality, and above the S&P 500's 26% gain. "I really felt validation for the team on how well received each of our EVs were," Barra, sporting her trademark black leather jacket, said when asked what has surprised her about the year. The auto leader is now entering her 12th year at the helm — a tenure almost unheard of in competitive and returns-minded corporate America. What's next for Barra and GM in 2025 could mirror 2024, with a few twists and turns. Following in her father's footsteps (he was a die maker at GM's now-defunct Pontiac badge), Barra, 62, began her journey inspecting fenders at a Pontiac plant at age 18. She went on to graduate from the General Motors Institute in 1985, where she obtained a Bachelor of Science in electrical engineering. From there, her career path was as curvy as a country road — with stints in communications, marketing, and manufacturing. It's these connections to the company that have given Barra a lot of credibility among the rank and file and shareholders. Now, her intricate knowledge and quicker speed to make tough calls have come together. "GM has walked the walk and talked the talk this year," Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said. "This could be a triple-digit stock if they execute." Ives rates GM's stock at outperform. GM's third quarter earnings topped Wall Street estimates on the top and bottom lines. Revenue reached $48.76 billion, beating estimates of $44.69 billion. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $2.96, surpassing the $2.43 that was expected. The automaker also raised its full-year outlook for the third time. By comparison, in late October, Ford said it expected to hit the lower end of its full-year profit guidance. Ford guided to about $10 billion in earnings before interest and taxes this year, down from its prior range of $10 billion to $12 billion. Some strength for GM comes courtesy of its crossover vehicles and a more keen eye toward EV profits, Bank of America analyst John Murphy said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast. He's bullish on GM's longer-term product portfolio, a mix of gas-powered trucks, cars, and EVs. “Importantly, when we get to calendar years ‘27 and ‘28, they have their pickups and large SUVs, which are an unbelievable franchise,” said Murphy, adding that no competitor has achieved this feat. “We may actually hit 18 million units in ‘27 and ‘28. I think there’s a tremendous amount of upside in the cycle." Barra had sought to be all-electric by 2035 but has since softened the stance amid industrywide weakness in EV sales. In July, GM delayed plans for a new Buick electric vehicle. Earlier this month, GM reached an agreement to sell its stake in a nearly completed EV battery plant in Lansing, Mich., to joint venture partner LG Energy Solution. GM expects to recoup its $1 billion investment in the plant. "We still have a plan that allows us to get there, and so we're still executing to that plan," Barra said of the 2035 EV target. "But the most important thing is, and I've been saying this for a couple years now, is we're going to be guided by the consumer. We want to give the consumer choice. What do they want to drive?" Investors don't want good money thrown after bad, either. But it's the uncertain return on EVs that continues to hold the stock's valuation back, analysts tell Yahoo Finance. Despite the year of big-time cost-cutting, stock buybacks, and upside earnings surprises, GM's stock only trades on a 4.9 times forward price-to-earnings multiple, according to Yahoo Finance data. For perspective, the S&P 500 trades at 23 times forward earnings. Tesla clocks in at 126 times forward earnings. Even Ford trades at 5.9 times forward earnings. "Without a doubt as far as the earnings and EBITDA [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization] and free cash flow, we’re going to be at record levels for GM this year," said Murphy. "That’s the level that nobody thought would ever be consistently hit and it seems like they may be hitting that for the next few years.” To stay in the good graces of investors, GM has made a flurry of key decisions late in the year that could shore up profits further. Besides unloading the aforementioned Lansing EV plant, GM opted this month to restructure its China operations. The restructuring will lead to a $5 billion non-cash charge in the fourth quarter. For years, GM has owned 50% of its joint venture with SAIC General Motors Corp. "It was absolutely the right decision to make. And I think there is the chance over time that the rationalization of restructuring of China ultimately means an exit," Murphy said. Then, after a series of operational setbacks, GM pulled the plug on its Cruise robotaxi business. The company had invested $10 billion since acquiring Cruise in 2016. GM said it would merge its Cruise robotaxi business with its in-house, consumer-facing autonomous and driving assist technology group in charge of its Supercruise software. "I think we made some difficult decisions this year to set the business up for success because we're trying to really be proactive and look at where's the business going," Barra said of the China and Cruise decisions. More difficult decisions may be in the cards for 2025, if incoming President Donald Trump slaps 25% tariffs on key auto supplier countries Mexico and Canada. The auto industry is responsible for 26% of imports from Mexico to the US and 12% from Canada, UBS researchers estimate. GM produces highly profitable pickup trucks in Mexico. It has five large assembly plants in the countries. "Almost a third of GM's vehicles are coming from outside the US or from mostly from Mexico in North America," Murphy explained. "And there's a question of how fast you can react to that. You don't have a lot of extra capacity in the US to move." Barra is clear-eyed about the situation. "[Tariffs are] going to have an impact depending on what it is, how long it is, it will impact prices, which, you know, I think could have an impact on demand. But I think we don't want to get ahead of ourselves. I think right now is the time to communicate and make sure people understand the different impacts that will happen based on different decisions," Barra said. "And I have confidence that the new administration will look and do what's best for the American consumer and best for continuing to have great jobs that the auto industry provides."

Innovation and business go hand in hand — and that's constantly on enterprise leaders' minds, regardless of their industry. Executives must understand how technological advancements, systemic barriers, and generational shifts are affecting their growth, then strategize accordingly. Business Insider's annual list of people transforming business highlights these leaders who work in media, finance, technology, transportation, and labor. The WNBA's first female commissioner, Cathy Engelbert, is spearheading a transformation in the sports sector with her focus on fan engagement and equity among players. In finance, Leon Sinclair is leveraging data and analytics to reshape the world of alternative investments at Preqin, where he's an executive vice president. Mike Hopkins, the head of Amazon's Prime Video and MGM Studios, is forging an ad-focused entertainment-business strategy that could redefine how content is made and consumed in the digital age. Below, in alphabetical order by first name, are the 10 business leaders our reporters and editors credit with shaking up and remolding their industries. Employers often say they prefer to hire employees who act like owners. As the executive director of the nonprofit Ownership Works, Miller aims to get employers to act on that ethos. "It's not credible to ask employees to feel, think, and act like owners if you don't give them a financial ownership stake," Miller said. Since its founding in 2021, Ownership Works and its corporate partners have shared $570 million in wealth across six companies and worked with more than 160,000 workers at 113 companies. One way Miller seeks to convince business owners of the merits of employee shareholding is by showing them how it can improve the bottom line. She pointed to a time an employee in an Ownership Works company helped their employer save money by replacing a component costing $100 with a 3D printed part that cost just a few dollars. "They often know where the company is losing money or making a mistake or where things could be better," Miller said. "And they often have ideas for how to fix the problem. It's just nobody ever asked them to." Miller's career in employee ownership grew out of an interest in community development. Early in her career she helped a nonprofit in Hawaii create farming cooperatives, and she worked with another nonprofit to convert small businesses into worker cooperatives. Miller said she wanted to find scale, so she approached Pete Stavros, KKR's cohead of private equity. Stavros first experimented with employee ownership at a garage-door manufacturer in 2015, leading to some of KKR's best results. He was looking to spread that model further. After announcing the creation of Ownership Works with a $10 million donation, Stavros hired Miller as his first employee. Now it's her job to help the company's 35 private-equity partners, including KKR and Apollo, institute plans in their portfolios. She does this in part by partnering with accountants, lawyers, and professional-services firms to make it easier to create these plans, acting as an employee-ownership consultancy. The organization also collects and shares metrics of success, such as hundreds of millions of dollars in grants to employees and decreasing turnover and higher profits at companies with employee ownership. She's helping the nonprofit expand beyond private equity. Ownership Works recently worked with the cold-storage company Lineage to give $100 million in IPO proceeds to its employees and create a stock-ownership plan. Miller believes that expanding employee ownership could significantly narrow the wealth gap and reduce financial insecurity. Sadoun said he mostly received pushback when, in 2017, he told creative agencies that the future of creativity was commerce and AI. "It's funny when you look at what happened now," Sadoun, the chief executive of the French advertising giant Publicis Groupe, told BI. Back then, Sadoun faced a daunting task. He had just taken over as the third-ever leader of the 91-year-old company, home to the storied agencies Leo Burnett, Saatchi & Saatchi, and Publicis Conseil, which had created iconic advertising like the Marlboro Man, Tony the Tiger, and "Labour Isn't Working." But Publicis was languishing behind its competitors having lost key clients like McDonald's. Financial growth was anemic. Sadoun embarked on a plan to turn Publicis from a communications partner to a company that could help clients transform their businesses. He sought to break down silos between Publicis' various agencies and help them retool around a bet on "personalization at scale," advanced by the biggest acquisition in its history: the 2019 purchase of the data marketing firm Epsilon for $4.4 billion. "The financial market did not like that," Sadoun said. Neither did many of Publicis' own employees, particularly the Don Draper-esque creatives who were maddened that an outsize focus on data and programmatic ads meant the Parisian company would lose its je ne sais quoi. Competitors mocked Publicis' multimillion-dollar investment in creating an AI platform. Sadoun and Publicis are having the last laugh. At about $27 billion, Publicis' market capitalization is the largest of any individual advertising-agency holding company. It's forecast to end the year with the largest annual revenue, too, with the combination of its data and media offerings representing about half of its sales. While 2024 was a cause for celebration, it faces challenges ahead: This month, its rival Omnicom announced a deal to acquire Interpublic Group that would create the largest ad-agency network. Sadoun described Publicis' award-winning campaign for the French telco Orange as a good outward representation of its modernized offering to marketers. The commercial begins with stars from the French men's national football team flaunting their skills. The reveal — using VFX and deepfake technology — is that the stars of the ad were in fact from Les Bleues, the women's national team. Sadoun credits his leadership team and employees for Publicis' turnaround. He has a more personal hope for his own legacy. In 2022, Sadoun had an operation to remove a tumor in his neck that turned out to be cancerous. Unusually for the CEO of a public company, he disclosed his diagnosis before he underwent treatment: grueling rounds of chemo and radiotherapy that would affect the jet-setting executive's ability to travel. He was flooded with messages revealing that many people were hiding their chronic illnesses from their employers and colleagues. The following year, Sadoun helped launch the Working with Cancer Pledge, which encourages companies to commit to offering more recovery-focused working environments. More than 600 companies have signed up, and the initiative was promoted with a splashy Super Bowl ad bought and created by Publicis last year. "My one mission in life now, apart from my family, is to erase the stigma of cancer in the workplace," Sadoun said. 2024 was a transformative year for the WNBA. It said that attendance increased by nearly 50% year over year and that ratings on ESPN were up by 170% from last season, fueled in part by its rookie stars like Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese. Sponsorship deals have boomed, bringing in advertisers newer to the sports world like Bumble and Skims. Presiding over its astronomical growth is Engelbert, a former Deloitte CEO who became the league's commissioner in 2019. The league has been planting the seeds of its growth for a while. It gained attention by playing during the pandemic in a bubble. It raised $75 million from investors, allowing it to invest in marketing and fan engagement. And it landed sponsorships on its own, separate from the NBA. External factors like the rise of "name, image, and likeness" deals and social media also helped draw attention to the sport. "The thing that was overlooked is that Rome wasn't built in a day," Engelbert told BI. "We didn't do this overnight." One emphasis was on improving the fan experience by meeting spectators where they were, such as updating the app to look more like TikTok, Engelbert said. The WBNA is a big brand now, and with its growth has come scrutiny. Engelbert took heat when she didn't directly condemn threatening comments on social media toward players but likened the situation to a rivalry between male players in the 1970s. She later apologized, promising to do better. "We've been debriefing around a lot of things that happened this year," Engelbert told BI, adding that the league was looking at beefing up security and mental-health resources. "The vitriol our players, me, we all get, we're going to try to tackle that multidimensionally." Engelbert also wants to talk about the flip side. "There's a huge negative to all the vitriol, but there's also people caring about the league like they haven't before," she said. "Apathy's the death of a brand, and there's no more apathy." The WNBA, which is majority-owned by the NBA, remains unprofitable; several outlets described sources as saying it was on track to lose $40 million or more this season. The WNBA declined to comment. Increased sponsorship and media rights will be crucial to keeping up the W's momentum and getting in the black. In a big start, the women's league recently struck an 11-year, $200 million media-rights deal, up from its current deal of $60 million a year. Engelbert also has her sights set on global expansion, starting with the WNBA getting its first Canadian franchise next year. Corporate sponsorships are catching up to the rise of women's sports. Engelbert is ready to capitalize, with stats to appeal to the bottom line. "There's a little scratching and clawing to make sure the old view of the WNBA is not the current view," she said. "Our fans are actually likely to buy from you. So we say this is a good business decision for you." Almost 20 years ago, while she taught at Princeton, Li, known as the "godmother of AI," tested the hypothesis that everything humans could see could be categorized and labeled. This idea built off her graduate research focused on object recognition. Li harnessed the power of crowdsourcing to pioneer ImageNet, a database of 15 million images that became the foundation of computer-vision and deep-learning research. Li has continued advancing this research. This year, she and the leading AI researchers Justin Johnson, Christoph Lassner, and Ben Mildenhall launched World Labs, a startup that aims to take AI beyond large language models. It's valued at $1 billion. With $230 million in funding from investors like Andreessen Horowitz, AMD Ventures, and Nvidia's NVentures, World Labs is seeking to explore AI applications in the two-dimensional plane of pixels and in 3D worlds with spatial intelligence. In December, World Labs dropped its first AI project: a tool designed to turn any image into a 3D model. Since her initial research breakthroughs, Li has testified before Congress about applying responsible ethics to AI and has advocated the inclusion of more women and people of color in the field. "Language is important but, as humans, much of our ability to understand and interact with the world is based on what we see," Li wrote in an op-ed article in The Economist in November. She believes spatial intelligence — which can help with developing robots that look after older adults, or extra hands for a surgeon — is what truly human-centered AI will look like. She's now a codirector of Stanford University's Institute for Human-Centered AI and serves as the Sequoia Capital professor of computer science at Stanford. Li has also worked as a vice president and chief scientist of AI and machine learning at Google Cloud. Huang is becoming the stuff of legend. He has a reputation as a genius, a visionary, and a workaholic. Bosses everywhere want to know his every theory of management to replicate even a fraction of his success. That's because Nvidia has gone from a niche tech firm to one of the most valuable companies in the world in a little more than two years. After decades of toiling out of the limelight, providing the video-gaming industry with graphics chips to render complex, ever-changing imagery but not gaining much name recognition beyond it, Nvidia burst into broader consciousness in 2022, after ChatGPT came to the market. Word quickly spread that the company had for years been buying thousands of Nvidia graphics processing units — it turned out that the kind of computing they're best at is similar to the demands of artificial intelligence. Huang actually donated OpenAI's first eight GPUs, delivering them himself. But Huang anticipated the connection between his chips and AI long before then — he just didn't know how it would materialize. Huang, 61, was born in southwestern Taiwan. He studied electrical engineering at the University of Oregon and Stanford. He had a few jobs in the semiconductor industry, including at Nvidia's major competitor AMD, until he founded Nvidia at 30 with Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem. Despite the recent spotlight on him now, Huang has staying power. He's one the longest-serving tech CEOs, with more than 30 years at the helm. In a recently published memoir, Morris Chang, the founder of Nvidia's most important supplier, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, described offering Huang the CEO job at TSMC. Even now that Nvidia has a market capitalization of more than $3 trillion, Huang sees his work as far from finished. "I watched Jensen make these kinds of bets that are far-reaching, where there's a lot of ambiguity as to when it's going to happen or not," Rev Lebaredian, a vice president of omniverse and simulation technology at Nvidia, told Business Insider this year. Huang is usually right. The journey to enter 2025 with hundreds of foundation models chasing ChatGPT started for Nvidia in about 2006. The next big journey may be self-driving cars and robots, or something else entirely. Some investors still worry that when it comes to Nvidia, what goes up must come down. But investors also believe that if anyone can see or make the future, it's Huang. Sinclair, who grew up in the market town of Rugby in the middle of England, didn't picture a career in finance. "We never really spoke about money around the dinner table or anything like that because there was never any of it," the 42-year-old told Business Insider in an interview. Now Sinclair is helping demystify private markets and powering its growth through data. With civil service in mind, he studied political science at Loughborough University and joined England's Department of Health shortly after graduating in 2004. But Sinclair, a competitive basketball and track athlete, quickly tired of the bureaucracy and craved a faster-paced work culture. After six months, he left for a research-analyst position at Intercontinental Exchange, the operator of major stock exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange and clearinghouses. The finance novice was eager to catch up and learn as much as he could about debt products and subprime markets. He left in 2010 for the data provider Markit, well before the firm merged with IHS and was acquired by S&P Global. Throughout his two-decade career he has maintained a sense of intellectual curiosity, describing himself as one of the most avid readers of industry news among his peers. Drawn to the complexity of private markets, he pivoted away from credit to build IHS Markit's private-equity and debt division. In 2023, he joined the private-markets-data powerhouse Preqin. "You see some of the most innovative companies in the world, and you work with some of the most innovative funds in the world who are deploying capital into just really interesting spaces," he said. Sinclair oversees how Preqin addresses the needs of fund managers, investment banks, and placement agents, representing some 3,000 front-office teams, trying to navigate the opaque industry of private markets. Preqin says the asset class has more than doubled to $16.8 trillion in assets under management over the past five years. Preqin's data can be used, for instance, to target limited partners for fundraising or create customized benchmarks to better convey performance to investors. Private markets are becoming more transparent as providers like Preqin find ways to combine publicly available and proprietary data, Sinclair said. In June, his division launched a data tool to analyze deals across 6,500 funds. This aggregated data can be used to back up valuations in negotiations or identify which financial factors, such as revenue growth or debt pay-down, contributed the most value to a successful deal. The firm's insights are set to become more widely available, as BlackRock is set to acquire Preqin for $3.2 billion. Sinclair said it's easier for individual investors to participate in private markets than ever before, pointing to the growth of data products and favorable regulatory developments. But he added that having options isn't the same as understanding them. "There's a massive amount of education to do. Alternatives have a totally different vocabulary, a different way of thinking about performance, a different way of thinking about risks to the types of products," he said. "I think there's also an obligation of the industry to build the right analytical tools, the right educational tools, datasets to bring the mass affluent along on that journey." The electric-vehicle market has experienced tremendous upheaval in the past year, and car companies are scrambling to understand today's EV buyers. At Ford, Gjaja, the chief operating officer of the Model e electric division, is tasked with navigating the money-losing division through huge changes in demand and customer profiles. After years of growth in the EV segment driven by wealthy early adopters, car companies face the challenge of selling these expensive and complex vehicles to more-regular customers. Ford split its gas and electric divisions in 2022 in a bid to speed up EV development. The company's EV strategy has changed a few times since then, but Ford still breaks out its financial performance: So far in 2024, the Model e division has lost $3.6 billion. In his operations role, Gjaja is trying to reverse those losses by working with Ford's dealers to improve customer experiences and perceptions. Before joining Ford in 2022, Gjaja was a senior partner at Boston Consulting Group, where he worked with clients in retail, technology, and automotive, among other industries. He's putting those years of consulting experience to work as Ford tries to bridge the gap between the wealthy early adopters behind the initial success of vehicles like the Mustang Mach-E and the F-150 Lighting and the more-practical customers who more often leave the lot with a hybrid. While higher prices have turned off some of these new EV shoppers, Gjaja said at an automotive conference in September that this cohort was considering a lot more than sticker price — including their distance from the nearest charger, the cost of charging, battery life, and resale values. Gjaja argued that simply discounting electric cars wouldn't be enough to convince shoppers and certainly wouldn't solve Ford's profitability problem in its Model e division. Instead of focusing on "functional economics," Gjaja said, he examines the "behavioral economics" of EV adoption. He said the journey from what he called an EV denier to a long-term convert could take up to three years. "My job is to figure out how to sell and market a vehicle that people don't appreciate its value until they own it for three years," Gjaja said. Amazon is a retail and cloud powerhouse, and thanks to Hopkins, it's become a media powerhouse, too. Under Hopkins, Amazon now offers not just a wide variety of TV and films but some of the biggest sports franchises like the NFL and the NBA, and even news. Amazon spent $18.9 billion on video and music in 2023, up by 14% from 2022. According to the data firm Ampere Analysis, sports is a growing part of Amazon's entertainment outlay, accounting for 14.3% in 2024, up from virtually nothing five years ago. Amazon's entertainment offerings help keep people subscribing to Prime, the free-delivery service that includes Prime Video and other benefits. But it's also becoming a moneymaker in its own right. In January, Amazon shook up the streaming-ads market when it turned on ads in Prime Video, driving down ad prices for competitors like Netflix while giving Amazon a big shot at the $28.8 billion pie that EMARKETER has forecast will be spent on streaming-TV ads this year. Morgan Stanley has estimated the move could bring in $3.3 billion in revenue this year, on top of Amazon's existing ad business, worth $47 billion in 2023. And with NFL and other streaming rights, Amazon is muscling in on traditional TV networks' turf and training viewers that it's the place to go for live sports. It's even dipped a toe in news, the last stronghold of traditional TV, with a Brian Williams-hosted election-night special. Hopkins' hire in 2020, along with the NBC entertainment vet Jennifer Salke's two years earlier, was a big signal that Amazon was serious about establishing itself as a key player in entertainment. Hopkins is a product of legacy and digital entertainment, having been the chairman of Sony Pictures Television and the CEO of Hulu. At Amazon, he oversaw the $8.5 billion acquisition of the film studio MGM and pushed the company's entertainment studio to expand into broader fare. Prime Video also makes money by fulfilling its promise of being a one-stop shop for viewers by selling subscriptions to other companies' apps like Max, Starz, and, in its most recent flex, Apple TV+. "What we're trying to build is a next-generation entertainment service," Hopkins recently told Bloomberg. Prime Video captured just 3.7% of TV viewing in November, well behind Netflix (7.7%) and YouTube (10.8%), per Nielsen. Despite some wins, like the popular show "The Boys" and the buzzy film "Saltburn," it has a way to go in becoming a consistent hit factory. Still, since most people don't pay for Prime Video as a stand-alone service, it doesn't have the churn problem that dogs other streamers. As part of Amazon, Prime Video is also insulated from some of the financial pressures affecting other entertainment companies. Hopkins is still bringing financial discipline to bear, however. Amazon cut hundreds of jobs across Prime Video and MGM Studios teams early in 2024. Hopkins recently told Bloomberg that the advertising ramp-up was a factor in pursuing NBA rights and that he expected Prime Video to be profitable "very soon." Since 2021, Varkey has been the president of the Mayo Clinic Health System, a network of 16 community hospitals and 45 multispecialty clinics across more than three dozen communities in Minnesota and Wisconsin. The facilities serve rural areas where care can otherwise be difficult to access. Varkey, who comes from a family of physicians, said her work focused on reaching patients without ready access to the sprawling Mayo Clinic campus in Rochester, Minnesota, and its world-renowned medical expertise. Varkey told Business Insider that part of her focus was finding new ways to incorporate technology so that more people can obtain care and administrative burdens can be reduced. That includes using artificial intelligence to help with diagnosing conditions and using technology so that clinicians can manage complex chronic conditions virtually. The efforts also include introducing a mobile clinic that can go where routine and preventive care is needed and even provide wireless internet access so patients can confer with specialists. The clinic, which travels across southern Minnesota, offers virtual or in-person appointments. It has two exam rooms and a laboratory. "So now you have preventive exams, specialist visits that are occurring in very remote areas," she said. Varkey said Mayo Clinic Health System was also trying to bring medical expertise to rural residents through programs that connect small local clinics with specialists from hub sites or from Mayo's Rochester campus. Small clinics, she said, might have only a single nurse practitioner — nothing like the variety of disciplines a larger facility would have. "It's been very exciting to watch, and patients have really appreciated it as well," Varkey said. Another effort to meet patients where they are is the organization's hospital-at-home program. Varkey said remote monitoring technology helped these patients remain with family and be more comfortable than they'd be in a medical facility. "You get the same Mayo care," she said, adding that the approach had been popular with patients. Varkey, who also holds an MBA from the University of Minnesota, returned to Mayo in 2021 after serving as the president and CEO of Yale New Haven Health Northeast Medical Group. From 2001 to 2013, Varkey held leadership positions at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, including associate chair of the Department of Medicine, medical director of Ask Mayo Clinic, and program director of the Preventive Medicine Fellowship. Varkey said the expanding capabilities of AI and discoveries in genomics and molecular medicine were "taking healthcare to the next level — and very fast." While those developments are exciting, Varkey said, they shouldn't distract from the primary goal of patient-centered care. Kapila likes to stay ahead of the game. During the first 10 years of his career, the computer-science graduate completed four certifications each year while working as a tech consultant for firms like Nasdaq and Sallie Mae. While working at the hedge fund Citadel in the mid-2000s, he took MBA classes at night at Northwestern University. "Everything in this field changes so quickly," he said. "Things change in finance and things change in tech at an ever increasing pace." Now Kapila is a copresident and chief operating officer of Parametric, a pioneer of direct indexing with $570 billion in assets under management. He joined Parametric in 2019 after rising up the ranks at BlackRock, overseeing portfolio construction management for its widely used Aladdin platform. Kapila moved to a much smaller firm to have a bigger impact. "It was an opportunity to kind of look at what Parametric has done well, think about how to build on the success, but then also take advantage of what's happening in the technology space and rethink how Parametric could operate, let's say, five years from that point," he said. His move was well timed. There has been a boom in direct indexing, a tax-savvy investing strategy of buying individual securities modeled off an index like the S&P 500. Two years after Kapila joined Parametric, Morgan Stanley acquired Parametric's parent company, Eaton Vance. Thanks to a wave of similar acquisitions, Parametric faces well-capitalized competitors such as BlackRock's Aperio and Franklin Templeton's Canvas. Industry stalwarts like Fidelity and upstarts like Envestnet also want a piece of the action. Kapila said Parametric, founded in 1987, has experience and scale on its side. "I will say that given the technology trends, sometimes it's easy to come in and have a solution. It's much, much harder to have a scalable solution that will serve clients when the demand spikes," he said. "We're managing over 200,000 accounts for our clients. The level of scale, I think, often is a breaking point for some of the newer entrants." To stay ahead of the competition, Kapila is pushing Parametric to develop more automated products, such as Radius, which launched this year. Radius constructs fixed-income and equity portfolios and runs simulations to identify the best selections for portfolio managers. Kapila described it as a "turning point" for Parametric. "This is the first time we've had a product that's really end-to-end running in that automated platform manner with a person reviewing and approving and intervening as necessary," he said. He plans to launch more cloud-native tools, which are easier to scale and manage, for other asset classes in 2025 and 2026. Parametric is also bringing its tax-savvy strategies to active management, launching Custom Active this summer. Rather than modeling portfolios off indexes, clients can pick equities off strategies from its asset-management partner Lazard or sports-league sponsors. "Those are examples where we can provide a tax overlay and help people get the advantages of direct indexing while managing to an active model," Kapila said. "There's a demand for that, and it's early days," he added, "but I think that's really what's playing out."
