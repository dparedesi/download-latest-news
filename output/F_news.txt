Posted on 10/22/2024 12:05:12 PM PDT by Red Badger A mysterious "cooling EV sentiment" has affected nearly every automaker, and even Ford‚Äôs once white-hot electric pickup truck may be starting to feel the burn. As dealers struggle to sell remaining 2024 Ford F-150 Lightning models, Ford is inventing new ways to move metal. One way is by introducing Retail Replenishment Centers (RRCs), locations dedicated to holding inventory to manage flooring costs and space for dealers. Ford is enticing dealers to ‚Äúbuy now,‚Äù and dealerships can earn up to $22,500 per month by ordering trucks from the RRC. Ford hopes to move more electric trucks with dramatic dealer incentives According to a new memo circulating the web, Ford is offering dealers up to $1,000 per unit when they restock their Lightning inventory via the RRC. But, that figure creeps up to $1,500 each when the dealer orders nine or more units ‚Äì up to a maximum of 15. Since Ford has offered to pay retroactively to the first unit, that means a total of $22,500 is sitting on the table. The program will run from October 15 until November 15 of this year, and Ford says it‚Äôs a win-win situation. Dealers can save space while still offering shoppers the same or more flexibility in the model they choose. It could backfire; some dealerships may take advantage of the rebate only to find that it simply doesn‚Äôt make sense to normally have the Lightning in stock. That could diminish choices for shoppers ‚Äì and competition for Lightning-stocked Ford dealers. Almost every 2024 Ford F-150 Lightning is eligible for the rebate No need for dealers or shoppers to pick and choose, either. Eligible trim levels include the XLT, Flash, Lariat, and Platinum trim levels of the 2024 Ford F-150 Lightning. That‚Äôs every trim level that Ford currently offers, sans the work-truck spec F-150 Lightning Pro. As the least-expensive trim in the Lightning stable, it‚Äôs currently reserved for fleet sales ‚Äì and not generally eligible for retail sale. Limited Lightnings on the lot could be a bad thing There are potential downsides to this strategy. Ford dealers might realize that having one or two Lightnings on the lot is more than enough. So, customers might have a lot more limited options when arranging test drives. Potential customers that want to touch and feel the exact product before buying may be driven elsewhere, too. Generally, the pros should outweigh the cons - driving dealers to offer more attractive pricing and hopefully motivating dealers behind the times to start pushing EVs a little more seriously. The extra rebate makes a 2024 Ford F-150 Lightning an even more attractive proposition. As of this writing, 2024 Ford F-150 Lightning offers are already extensive. Ford offers 0 percent financing for up 60 months ‚Äì and a very competitive 1.9 percent for 72-month terms. That‚Äôs nearly unheard of, thanks to where today‚Äôs interest rates currently sit. Customers that lease don‚Äôt really have the same incentives on hand, but they‚Äôd probably be happy to save the extra $1,000 or $1,500 where they can. They also still benefit from Ford's commitment - the ‚ÄúFord Power Promise‚Äù - to cover install costs on Level 2 chargers for EV buyers. Final thoughts Paying dealers to take vehicles usually is not a very good sign. But it‚Äôs important to take a look at the full picture. Ford sold a record number of EVs in Q3 of 2024. Their EV sales expanded 45 percent year-over-year, making them second only to Tesla in US EV sales for the year. Perhaps they‚Äôre looking to keep the gravy train rolling in the face of ‚Äì at least what‚Äôs being touted as ‚Äì waning consumer sentiment. Or, they‚Äôre just making room for the 2025s ‚Äì at any cost. Whatever the case, it might be the best time yet to pick up a Lightning if you‚Äôre looking.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 8 | View Replies] To: Red Badger Even EV drivers have problems taking the Lightning on trips. With the extended range battery at 131kWh, lets say you pull up to a charger with 20% left and charge up to 80%. That's 79 kWh. You'd be good to get out of there in half an hour at the fastest chargers. Driving 75 mph on the highway (with no load), you'd probably get a real world range of 170 miles before you stop another 30 minutes to charge. One of many reasons a full size EV pickup is impractical. As opposed to an EV car (smaller battery, better miles per kWh) charging in 15 minutes every 200 miles. A little pre-planning with trips with plenty of chargers (i.e. up and down the eastern seaboard like I did this past summer), means driving and charging an EV is about as fast as driving and filling up a gas car (at least as often as my wife wants to stop and stretch her legs LOL). So we're able to compare charging prices with gas prices on those trips and pick which of our two cars is cheapest to drive (EV car or gas pickup). But even with that, an EV is practical only if you drive enough miles for the gas savings to be worth it, can charge at home, have two cars so that one car can be a gas car for the times an EV won't do, and don't drive much in the northern cold winter. Anyone who doesn't meet all of those criteria shouldn't consider an EV. That's from a free market and practical standpoint. Not from the warmageddon-cult-government-should-incentivize-or-force-everyone-to-drive-EVs perspective like the Dims do. 16 posted on 10/22/2024 12:53:34 PM PDT by Tell It Right (1 Thessalonians 5:21 -- Put everything to the test, hold fast to that which is true.)

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 8 | View Replies] To: Red Badger Even EV drivers have problems taking the Lightning on trips. With the extended range battery at 131kWh, lets say you pull up to a charger with 20% left and charge up to 80%. That's 79 kWh. You'd be good to get out of there in half an hour at the fastest chargers. Driving 75 mph on the highway (with no load), you'd probably get a real world range of 170 miles before you stop another 30 minutes to charge. One of many reasons a full size EV pickup is impractical. As opposed to an EV car (smaller battery, better miles per kWh) charging in 15 minutes every 200 miles. A little pre-planning with trips with plenty of chargers (i.e. up and down the eastern seaboard like I did this past summer), means driving and charging an EV is about as fast as driving and filling up a gas car (at least as often as my wife wants to stop and stretch her legs LOL). So we're able to compare charging prices with gas prices on those trips and pick which of our two cars is cheapest to drive (EV car or gas pickup). But even with that, an EV is practical only if you drive enough miles for the gas savings to be worth it, can charge at home, have two cars so that one car can be a gas car for the times an EV won't do, and don't drive much in the northern cold winter. Anyone who doesn't meet all of those criteria shouldn't consider an EV. That's from a free market and practical standpoint. Not from the warmageddon-cult-government-should-incentivize-or-force-everyone-to-drive-EVs perspective like the Dims do. 16 posted on 10/22/2024 12:53:34 PM PDT by Tell It Right (1 Thessalonians 5:21 -- Put everything to the test, hold fast to that which is true.)

Dealers can save space while still offering shoppers the same or more flexibility in the model they choose. It could backfire; some dealerships may take advantage of the rebate only to find that it simply doesn‚Äôt make sense to normally have the Lightning in stock. That could diminish choices for shoppers ‚Äì and competition for Lightning-stocked Ford dealers. Almost every 2024 Ford F-150 Lightning is eligible for the rebate No need for dealers or shoppers to pick and choose, either. Eligible trim levels include the XLT, Flash, Lariat, and Platinum trim levels of the 2024 Ford F-150 Lightning. That‚Äôs every trim level that Ford currently offers, sans the work-truck spec F-150 Lightning Pro. As the least-expensive trim in the Lightning stable, it‚Äôs currently reserved for fleet sales ‚Äì and not generally eligible for retail sale. Limited Lightnings on the lot could be a bad thing There are potential downsides to this strategy. Ford dealers might realize that having one or two Lightnings on the lot is more than enough. So, customers might have a lot more limited options when arranging test drives. Potential customers that want to touch and feel the exact product before buying may be driven elsewhere, too. Generally, the pros should outweigh the cons - driving dealers to offer more attractive pricing and hopefully motivating dealers behind the times to start pushing EVs a little more seriously. The extra rebate makes a 2024 Ford F-150 Lightning an even more attractive proposition. As of this writing, 2024 Ford F-150 Lightning offers are already extensive. Ford offers 0 percent financing for up 60 months ‚Äì and a very competitive 1.9 percent for 72-month terms. That‚Äôs nearly unheard of, thanks to where today‚Äôs interest rates currently sit. Customers that lease don‚Äôt really have the same incentives on hand, but they‚Äôd probably be happy to save the extra $1,000 or $1,500 where they can. They also still benefit from Ford's commitment - the ‚ÄúFord Power Promise‚Äù - to cover install costs on Level 2 chargers for EV buyers. Final thoughts Paying dealers to take vehicles usually is not a very good sign. But it‚Äôs important to take a look at the full picture. Ford sold a record number of EVs in Q3 of 2024. Their EV sales expanded 45 percent year-over-year, making them second only to Tesla in US EV sales for the year. Perhaps they‚Äôre looking to keep the gravy train rolling in the face of ‚Äì at least what‚Äôs being touted as ‚Äì waning consumer sentiment. Or, they‚Äôre just making room for the 2025s ‚Äì at any cost. Whatever the case, it might be the best time yet to pick up a Lightning if you‚Äôre looking.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 8 | View Replies] To: Red Badger Even EV drivers have problems taking the Lightning on trips. With the extended range battery at 131kWh, lets say you pull up to a charger with 20% left and charge up to 80%. That's 79 kWh. You'd be good to get out of there in half an hour at the fastest chargers. Driving 75 mph on the highway (with no load), you'd probably get a real world range of 170 miles before you stop another 30 minutes to charge. One of many reasons a full size EV pickup is impractical. As opposed to an EV car (smaller battery, better miles per kWh) charging in 15 minutes every 200 miles. A little pre-planning with trips with plenty of chargers (i.e. up and down the eastern seaboard like I did this past summer), means driving and charging an EV is about as fast as driving and filling up a gas car (at least as often as my wife wants to stop and stretch her legs LOL). So we're able to compare charging prices with gas prices on those trips and pick which of our two cars is cheapest to drive (EV car or gas pickup). But even with that, an EV is practical only if you drive enough miles for the gas savings to be worth it, can charge at home, have two cars so that one car can be a gas car for the times an EV won't do, and don't drive much in the northern cold winter. Anyone who doesn't meet all of those criteria shouldn't consider an EV. That's from a free market and practical standpoint. Not from the warmageddon-cult-government-should-incentivize-or-force-everyone-to-drive-EVs perspective like the Dims do. 16 posted on 10/22/2024 12:53:34 PM PDT by Tell It Right (1 Thessalonians 5:21 -- Put everything to the test, hold fast to that which is true.)

They also still benefit from Ford's commitment - the ‚ÄúFord Power Promise‚Äù - to cover install costs on Level 2 chargers for EV buyers. Final thoughts Paying dealers to take vehicles usually is not a very good sign. But it‚Äôs important to take a look at the full picture. Ford sold a record number of EVs in Q3 of 2024. Their EV sales expanded 45 percent year-over-year, making them second only to Tesla in US EV sales for the year. Perhaps they‚Äôre looking to keep the gravy train rolling in the face of ‚Äì at least what‚Äôs being touted as ‚Äì waning consumer sentiment. Or, they‚Äôre just making room for the 2025s ‚Äì at any cost. Whatever the case, it might be the best time yet to pick up a Lightning if you‚Äôre looking.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 8 | View Replies] To: Red Badger Even EV drivers have problems taking the Lightning on trips. With the extended range battery at 131kWh, lets say you pull up to a charger with 20% left and charge up to 80%. That's 79 kWh. You'd be good to get out of there in half an hour at the fastest chargers. Driving 75 mph on the highway (with no load), you'd probably get a real world range of 170 miles before you stop another 30 minutes to charge. One of many reasons a full size EV pickup is impractical. As opposed to an EV car (smaller battery, better miles per kWh) charging in 15 minutes every 200 miles. A little pre-planning with trips with plenty of chargers (i.e. up and down the eastern seaboard like I did this past summer), means driving and charging an EV is about as fast as driving and filling up a gas car (at least as often as my wife wants to stop and stretch her legs LOL). So we're able to compare charging prices with gas prices on those trips and pick which of our two cars is cheapest to drive (EV car or gas pickup). But even with that, an EV is practical only if you drive enough miles for the gas savings to be worth it, can charge at home, have two cars so that one car can be a gas car for the times an EV won't do, and don't drive much in the northern cold winter. Anyone who doesn't meet all of those criteria shouldn't consider an EV. That's from a free market and practical standpoint. Not from the warmageddon-cult-government-should-incentivize-or-force-everyone-to-drive-EVs perspective like the Dims do. 16 posted on 10/22/2024 12:53:34 PM PDT by Tell It Right (1 Thessalonians 5:21 -- Put everything to the test, hold fast to that which is true.)

Title: Why Ford Stock Is Not a Confident Pre-Earnings Pick
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-ford-stock-not-confident-165252134.html
Time Published: 2024-10-22T16:52:52Z
Full Content:
We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. If you buy a stock before an earnings event, the risk is elevated, and you need to be confident about the company‚Äôs growth trajectory. As it turns out, Ford Motor (F) is about to report its earnings data. As a cautious investor, I am bearish on Ford stock because the company‚Äôs already-released sales data raises concerns. Ford Motor is an automotive giant that sells both conventional and electric vehicles. The company pays a decent dividend and, as we‚Äôll discover, Ford shares appear to be bargain-priced. On the other hand, it‚Äôs not a great idea to jump on a stock just because a company has a low price-to-earnings (P/E) and offers a big dividend. It‚Äôs just as important for an automaker to demonstrate sales growth, and in that regard, Ford‚Äôs gears are stuck in reverse. You‚Äôve heard about value traps, and maybe you‚Äôve heard of yield traps. Could Ford fit into both of these categories? It‚Äôs entirely possible, so let‚Äôs delve into Ford‚Äôs details and see if there‚Äôs a value-and-yield trap with F stock. Ford has a non-GAAP trailing 12-month P/E ratio of 6.77x, which is certainly lower than the sector median P/E ratio of 14.98x. Furthermore, offers a forward annual dividend yield of 7.05%, which seems more favorable than the Consumer Cyclical Sector Average dividend yield of around 1%. Don‚Äôt jump to any conclusions, though. It‚Äôs possible for a company to have a very low P/E ratio and a very high dividend yield, like Ford does, if the share price drops sharply. It wasn‚Äôt too long ago when F stock plummeted from $14.50 to $11. Rapid, steep stock-price collapses can create distortions in P/E ratios and dividend yields, so don‚Äôt enter into any hasty trades with Ford stock right now. Quarterly financial reports can cause a stock to rally or tank. Nevertheless, some risk-takers will grab shares of Ford stock today, even though the company is set to disclose its third-quarter 2024 financial results on October 28, which is coming up very soon. So, there‚Äôs already reason to feel neutral about Ford stock right now. Yet, I‚Äôm actually feeling a little bit bearish about F stock before the company‚Äôs earnings event, and there‚Äôs a specific reason for this. I don‚Äôt have a crystal ball, but we all can look at Ford‚Äôs third-quarter 2024 vehicle sales numbers before the automaker‚Äôs financial results are to be released. Specifically, Ford sold 504,039 units versus 500,504 units in the year-earlier quarter, and that only represents a 0.7% year-over-year increase. In contrast, Ford demonstrated 7.7% year-on-year vehicle sales growth in the third quarter of 2023. Ford isn‚Äôt the only Detroit-based automaker showing an alarming sales trajectory, as Stellantis (STLA) recently posted a 20% decline in U.S. quarterly sales. Evidently, concerns about vehicle affordability are dragging on Detroit-based automakers‚Äô sales growth figures. So, ask yourself: Do I really need to take any unnecessary chances on F stock today? Moreover, there‚Äôs another sign that Ford‚Äôs having trouble under the hood. Specifically, Ford just announced its plans to reduce its subscription prices for the company‚Äôs BlueCruise hands-free driving technology. BlueCruise offers autonomous (hands-free) driving features, such as lane-keep assist and adaptive cruise control. In fact, Ford expects to lower the prices for both its annual and monthly BlueCruise subscriptions. These will be steep price cuts, from $75 to $50 for the monthly subscription plan and from $800 to $495 for the annual plan. This surely isn‚Äôt a positive sign for Ford. Self-driving features are supposed to be front-page news nowadays, but Ford‚Äôs steep subscription price cuts indicate that BlueCruise isn‚Äôt a highly in-demand service. This adds to my bearish argument and causes me to wonder whether competitors like Tesla (TSLA) will command a strong lead over Ford in the market for self-driving technology services. On TipRanks, F stock comes in as a Moderate Buy based on five Buys, nine Holds, and one Sell rating assigned by analysts in the past three months. The average Ford Motor stock price target is $12.68, implying 15.64% upside potential. If you‚Äôre wondering which analyst you should follow if you want to buy and sell Ford stock, the most accurate analyst covering the stock (on a one-year timeframe) is Michael Ward of Benchmark Co., with an average return of 11.88% per rating and a 50% success rate. See more F analyst ratings As you can see, analysts are only lukewarm about Ford Motor stock. Also, it‚Äôs apparent that Ford‚Äôs BlueCruise subscriptions aren‚Äôt selling like hotcakes. Additionally, with an earnings event coming up soon, Ford could disappoint investors as the automaker‚Äôs quarterly vehicle sales growth is slowing. In other words, Ford has issues to address, and investors don‚Äôt need to jump into what might be a value-and-yield trap. Instead, you can choose to wait until Ford‚Äôs third-quarter 2024 financial results to see if there are any major positive surprises. I‚Äôm not super-confident that this will happen, so as a cautious investor, I‚Äôm leaning slightly bearish on F stock and staying on the sidelines. Disclosure Sign in to access your portfolio
