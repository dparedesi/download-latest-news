We recently published a list of 8 Stocks Under $20 To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) stands against other under $20 stocks to invest in now. There has been a lot of discussion happening lately regarding the economy and the markets. While the economy was doing great with the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates and analysts expecting the markets to continue the bullish outlook, the recent geopolitical circumstances have again created doubt among investors. We recently covered an article about 10 Stocks Under $10 With High Potential, where we talked about how the market is expected to perform if the geopolitical situation escalates. Tom Lee, managing partner and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, mentioned that he would be buying the dip if the market goes there and also presented his bullish thesis regarding how the market tends to perform well after such tensions. Here’s an excerpt from the article: “Tom Lee, managing partner and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, appeared on CNBC to discuss what the stock market looks like in the current geopolitically tense environment. Lee has been bullish on small caps for a long time however, he has also remained cautious regarding some bumps in the start before the market for small caps starts to rise. He maintained a bullish stance, projecting a year-end target of 6,000 for the S&P 500, despite acknowledging potential short-term volatility due to upcoming events like the election and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. He emphasized that current market conditions are tricky, with headline risks stemming from a potential port strike that could impact the economy. Lee suggested that if a significant dip occurs, it would be a good opportunity to buy, as he believes the long-term outlook remains positive despite temporary setbacks. Talking about how the market has performed during wars in the past. Lee noted that historically, market reactions to geopolitical conflicts have often been more positive than anticipated. He cited past conflicts where buying during initial downturns proved beneficial, except for the recent Russia-Ukraine war which went otherwise due to concurrent Federal Reserve tightening.” Building upon how the market is progressing, Larry Adam, chief investment officer at Raymond James, says that the current market is exactly what a soft landing looks like. Adam recently appeared in an interview on CNBC to talk about how the lower interest rates will benefit the small caps in particular the Russell 2000. He believes that the bull market will continue while the economy inches towards a soft landing. When it comes to small-cap stocks they get around 56% of their financing from the short end of the curve. The short end of the curve refers to the short-term interest rate on the yield curve, which typically represents the yields on bonds with shorter maturities, such as 2-year or 5-year Treasury notes. Whereas the large-cap companies get only 26% financing from these short ends of the curve. Therefore, Adam believes that as the Fed continue to lower interest rates it will help small caps meet financing needs. He further pointed out that it is expected that the Fed will cut twice this year and another four times the next year. Another reason why he likes small caps is because the economy going towards a soft landing. Adam emphasized that we have already seen that the rate cuts helped small caps outperform the large caps. Historically speaking whenever the economy has a soft landing it typically helps the small caps greater than the rest of the market. Moreover, while mentioning his favorite sectors, Adam likes technology, healthcare, and industrials in both the small caps and large caps categories. While reasoning his interests in these sectors, he mentioned earnings in these sectors to be one of the prominent likable factors. Technology has been the only sector in the large caps category that has seen upward revisions. Moreover, the cash flow that these sectors are generating is being utilized in buybacks, paying dividends, and future growth expansions.
