We recently published a list of Jim Cramer’s Latest Calls Before 2025 Begins: Top 10 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F) stands against other stocks in Jim Cramer’s latest calls before 2025 begins. Jim Cramer in a latest program talked about the market reaction to the Federal Reserve’s latest rate cut and its guidance that suggested fewer rate cuts moving ahead. “I guess you could say the baby got thrown out with the bathwater. It was truly hideous, a little unexpected, and yes, wicked. Even though the market’s barely oversold, we may not get that quick snapback we normally expect in a deeply oversold market,” Cramer said. Jim Cramer said Jerome Powell’s comments and tone were “stern” and his conference call “confounded” investors. Cramer said inflation has not come down enough and that has made the Fed’s job difficult. Cramer then talked about different sectors and companies that need rate cuts amid a slowdown. “I really wish the Fed hadn’t been so defensive about the need to cut rates going forward. A slower approach would have been much better. If they had explicitly taken a wait-and-see approach before this meeting, we’d be in a better position. This time, they telegraphed the wrong thing, hence today’s meltdown. However, if the weaker part of the economy deteriorates further or inflation comes down, the Fed still has room to cut. Here’s the bottom line: a previously data-dependent Fed chose not to be data-dependent today with its pronouncements, and that’s what drove the market down. This happened despite the quarter-point rate cut—something that’s typically good news for stocks—but it turned out to be the very opposite.” READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In For this article, we watched some latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 11 stocks he is talking about. With each company, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

A Ford truck roaring down a highway, with powerful headlights blazing its way. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 36 Jim Cramer in a latest program on CNBC expressed his concerns over rising warranty costs of Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F) and said the stock does not have a lot of “MOJO.” “Ford does not have a lot of mojo in this note by Jefferies. This is one of the reasons—what can save the Fed when they cut. Ford has an inventory drifting up to 96 days. That says to me price cut, way too much, way too much. And by the way, that’s far more than GM—26. Wow. I mean, GM and Stellantis have much lower inventories.” Ford shares have gained about 10% over the past 10 years, a stark contrast to the S&P 500’s 250%. Legacy automakers like Ford are grappling with challenges from newer competitors, the shift to electric vehicles (EVs), and the rapid rise of autonomous technology. Ford’s Model e segment continues to drain cash as Ford works to strengthen its EV business. While the company has some strong products, it faces stiff competition from Tesla, Inc. (TSLA), Rivian Automotive, Inc. (RIVN), and other EV makers, leading to significant losses. Year-to-date, Ford’s EBIT has dropped to $8.1 billion, down from $9.4 billion in the same period last year. Ford’s struggle to reduce warranty costs remains a concern. The company issued 62 recalls in 2024, far surpassing General Motors Company (GM), which had 33. Since 2021, Ford has had the industry’s highest recall rate, reflecting poorly on management’s efforts to lower warranty expenses and damaging the brand’s reputation. Overall, F ranks 10th on our list of Jim Cramer’s latest calls before 2025 begins. While we acknowledge the potential of F, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: These Are The Best Cash-Back Deals At The Best Time Of The Year To Buy A Car

The 2024 Jeep Grand Cherokee is being offered with cash rebates as rich as $9,000 this month. Experts agree that the coming days are traditionally among the best of the year in which to go shopping for a new car, truck or SUV. The week between Christmas and New Year’s Day in particular is traditionally the period in which car shoppers can strike some of the sweetest new-car deals. Specifically, those who go out car shopping on New Year’s Eve can expect to obtain the deepest discounts of the month, with the next-best day being Christmas Eve, when few patrons tend to come walking through a dealership’s door. Already automakers are touting their holiday/year-end clearance sales promotions, with dealerships and salespeople expected to go all out to strike deals to both clear excess inventory and to qualify for bonuses for meeting year-end sales goals. The idea here is to capitalize on consumers who may still be in a spending mood, especially facing January and February, which are typically slower sales months. I scoured carmakers’ websites and found generous cash rebates to be the rule, rather than the exception as the calendar approaches 2025. Here, I’m listing 46 of the richest cash-back deals of $3,000 or more below that are good through the end of the year. The most money I found being slapped on the hood is on the 2024 Jeep Grand Cherokee, with rebates as large as $9,000. Many of the biggest cash-back deals are on electric vehicles, with several automakers offering $7,500 rebates on their batter-powered wares to level the proverbial playing field on models that do not otherwise qualify for the one-time federal tax credit. Otherwise, the biggest incentives tend to be among vehicles remaining in stock from the 2024 model-year, though several factory-fresh 2025 vehicles are nonetheless represented. Unfortunately, those looking for a deal on one of last-year’s models may have to settle on an unpopular color or feature combination, depending on what’s still remaining in inventory. There are also additional spiffs on some models, such as Ford offering a complimentary home charger and installation on its F-150 Lightning full-size electric pickup truck and the Mustang Mach-E electric SUV. Automakers typically also offer extra rebates to recent college graduates, first responders and military members, as well as those currently owning or leasing a model from a qualifying brand. Note that the cash rebate offers cited below are in addition to the dealer’s discount, which should be generous on outgoing 2014 vehicles, as time is money in the new-car business. Be sure to factor in the value of a manufacturer’s cash rebate or promotional discount only after you’ve reached an agreeable transaction price with a salesperson. This is where a little advance research can go a long way. Start by visiting an online pricing site to determine the manufacturer’s suggested retail price (MSRP) and establish a “target price” for any vehicle under consideration, including options. Traditionally this would be what’s noted as the “invoice price,” which is actually a few percent higher than the dealership’s actual cost. In some cases, especially with luxury-branded cars that aren’t usually sold with cash rebates, it could be a lot less. Automakers often offer their dealers what are often called “secret rebates” to enable additional room for deeper discounts as needed. However, be aware that automakers’ incentives often vary by region to address local supply and demand issues, and sometimes vary from one model’s trim level to another, so be sure to check a manufacturer’s website, usually under a “local offers” or “special deals” tab to confirm what’s being offered locally. In some cases you’ll find cash rebates combined with low, or even zero percent financing offers, which we’re featuring in a separate post. One Community. Many Voices.
