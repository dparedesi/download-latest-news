Forza is getting a ton of new content to close 2024. By Logan Moore One of the largest updates ever for Forza Motorsport is today releasing across Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and PC platforms. Since its launch a little over a year ago, developer Turn 10 Studios has continued to push out big patches for Forza Motorsport at a routine cadence to keep players engaged. Now, with 2024 winding down, Update 15 is finally going live and has brought with it some drastic overhauls to the racing title. Available to download now, Update 15 for Forza Motorsport is filled with the typical slew of bug fixes and other resolutions for Xbox and PC. Outside of this, though, Turn 10 has also added some new cars and laid the groundwork for new events that will take place in the weeks ahead. Additionally, those on PC have seen some particularly big upgrades to ray tracing that should make Forza look better than ever before.
