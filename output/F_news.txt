Good morning! It’s Friday, November 15, and this is The Morning Shift, your daily roundup of the top automotive headlines from around the world, in one place. Here are the important stories you need to know. Masterful gambit, Trump voters. The President-elect’s transition team is planning to kill the very popular $7,500 consumer tax credit for electric vehicles because it checks two boxes: broader tax reform and sticking up the middle finger to people who buy EVs. Both are very important to the Republican party. This could lead to some pretty disastrous ripple effects for the U.S. EV transition, which is already losing some steam. I know you might be thinking this will hurt “first buddy” Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, but apparently representatives for the automaker have told the Trump-transition committee they support ending the subsidy as well. Bonkers. From Reuters: Tesla CEO Elon Musk, one of Trump’s biggest backers and the world’s richest person, said in July that killing the subsidy might slightly hurt Tesla sales but would be “devastating” to its U.S. EV competitors, which include legacy automakers such as General Motors. Shares of Tesla ended nearly 6% lower at $311.18, while shares of smaller EV rival Rivian, opens new tab closed down 14% at $10.31. Lucid, another EV maker, tumbled 5% to $2.08. Repealing the subsidy, a signature measure of Democratic President Joe Biden‘s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), is being discussed in meetings by an energy-policy transition team led by billionaire oilman Harold Hamm, founder of Continental Resources, and Republican North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, the two sources said. The group has met several times since Trump’s Nov. 5 election victory, including at his Florida Mar-a-Lago club, where Musk has also spent considerable time since the election. [...] The Alliance for Automotive Innovation urged Congress in an Oct. 15 letter to retain the EV tax credits, calling them “critical to cementing the U.S. as a global leader” in future auto manufacturing. The Trump transition team did not comment on the fate of the EV tax credit but said in a statement that the president-elect would deliver on “promises he made on the campaign trail.” Trump campaigned on ending Biden’s “EV mandate,” without spelling out specific targeted policies. The energy-focused transition team has determined some of Biden’s clean-energy policies will be tough to end because they are popular and already funneling money to Republican-dominated states, the sources said. The team views the consumer EV credit as an easy target, believing that eliminating it would get broad consensus in a Republican-controlled Congress. Apparently, Trump could reallocate the funds saved by killing the credit to help pay for the extension of trillion of dollars in tax cuts from his first term that are set to expire soon. Congressional Republicans aim to take up the broader tax bill as one of their first actions. On the campaign trail, Trump promised to boost U.S. oil production, which, for the record, is at record highs. He also wants to roll back Biden’s clean-energy initiatives, which include subsidies for wind and solar power as well as the mass production of hydrogen, something Trump doesn’t understand at all. Here’s why this all could actually be good for Tesla. At least, here’s why Elon thinks it will, according to Reuters: Tesla has historically been the biggest beneficiary of consumer EV subsidies passed by Biden and previous administrations. It now may stand to gain from killing the incentive because that could hurt rising EV competitors more than Tesla. Musk himself pointed out as much in a July earnings call, saying losing the subsidy under Trump would “probably benefit Tesla” in the long term. Tesla sold just under half of all U.S. EVs in the third quarter, according to data from Cox Automotive. Other automakers with notable EV sales such as GM, Ford and Hyundai, individually trail far behind. But Tesla’s U.S. EV rivals collectively have steadily eroded its market share, which exceeded 80% in the first quarter of 2020. Nicholas Mersch, portfolio manager at Purpose Investments, a Tesla investor, said Tesla can withstand a potential sales hit from losing subsidies because the automaker’s “engineering and manufacturing prowess” lowers its costs. “Getting rid of the subsidy means that competitors can’t catch up and won’t be able to compete on a cost basis,” Mersch said Musk and Tesla also stand to gain hugely from Biden policies that Trump will likely leave in place or strengthen - like steep trade barriers blocking imports of Chinese EVs, including a 100% tariff. Here’s why American companies really need those subsidies: Automakers in the U.S. market have been bracing for automotive-policy changes under Trump. Some could provide greater flexibility to build more gas-powered SUVs and trucks that generate big profits for the Detroit Three - General Motors, Ford and Jeep parent Stellantis. But other changes, like losing the EV tax credit, could cripple their nascent efforts to transition to electric vehicles. Losing EV subsidies would make it tougher for Tesla’s struggling rivals to achieve profitability on those vehicles. GM, Ford, Hyundai and others are still ramping up EV production and scrambling to cut manufacturing costs. Ford, which expects to record a $5 billion loss on its EV and software operations this year, has previously relied on EV tax credits to boost demand from price-conscious consumers. Yet even with the credits, demand for Ford’s F-150 Lightning electric pickup has faltered, leading Ford to idle the truck’s production through the year-end. The United Auto Workers labor union, which represents workers at the Detroit Three - but not Tesla - has supported Biden’s pro-EV policies, including the $7,500 incentive. Last month, UAW president Shawn Fain slammed Trump’s threats to repeal the policies, saying “hundreds of thousands” of auto-industry jobs were at stake. GM, which touts plans to boost EV production, previously said it had received $800 million in separate EV manufacturing credits this year - also enacted in Biden’s IRA legislation - and expected that figure to grow. GM recently said it planned to slash its annual EV losses next year by between $2 billion and $4 billion, which would be more difficult without the tax credit. This is what America voted for. Sure, we’re all going down, but at least they’re going down too. Volkswagen and Rivian have officially kicked off their new $5.8 billion joint venture. Initially, it was a $5 billion investment in Rivian by VW to develop new electrical architecture and vehicle software for future vehicles that are set to start launching in 2027. Now, that investment has been upped by $800 million. Rivian software chief Wassym Bensaid and VW Group chief technology engineer Carsten Helbing are tasked with leading the “Rivian and VW Group Technology, LLC.” What an inspired name. Initially, teams will be based in Palo Alto, California, but three other sides in North America and Europe are in development. From the Verge: Rivian also showed off a prototype vehicle to a small group of reporters at its Palo Alto office. According to Bloomberg, the vehicle was a VW test vehicle with Rivian software that was created by the joint venture’s engineering team over a 12-week period. With the deal now closed, Rivian will receive an initial $1 billion loan from VW, followed by $1.3 billion in shares in Rivian, and an additional $3.5 billion over the next few years, VW Group CEO Oliver Blume said in a call with reporters Tuesday. The technology that emerges from the joint venture will underpin vehicles from both companies, from Rivian’s more affordable R2 vehicle, which is set to go into production in 2026, to a variety of models from the VW Group, including Audi, Porsche, Scout, and VW. “The positive aspect is that we will be scalable, from the very small segment up to luxury cars, [and] sports cars,” said Blume. “The electronic architecture... will be scalable and will be usable for a great volume of cars.” The new partnership comes at a time when both Rivian and Volkswagen could use a serious boost. At the time, the new venture was seen as a big win for Rivian, which has lost over $1 billion each quarter for the past year and is still struggling to find its financial footing since its public offering in 2021. The company recently said it expected to lose up to $2.88 billion in adjusted earnings for the year, up from the previous guidance of $2.7 billion in losses. And it has gone through several rounds of layoffs over the past two years. Meanwhile, VW has been going through its own struggles around EVs. The company’s plug-in models are selling well, but its market share in North America is shrinking. Its financial struggles began to peak this year, forcing it to close at least three of its German factories and downsize its remaining plants. And its software has been plagued by bugs and customer complaints. The new venture holds promise for both companies: VW gets access to Rivian’s software-first approach to auto manufacturing, which should help it compete better in the race to develop more software-defined vehicles that can receive updates over the air; and Rivian receives a much needed financial lifeline that will help it survive a more uncertain economic climate ahead. Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe has said that the capital will help carry the company through the production ramp up of the R2 at its existing plant in Normal, Ill., as well as a midsized EV platform at a factory in Georgia, where Rivian paused construction earlier this year. [...] “This partnership and this deal secures the capital for us to ensure that we can not only take Rivian through the launch of R2 in Normal, but secures the launch of and growth of R2 in our Georgia facility and through free cashflow positive for us as a business,” Scaringe added. Time will tell how this whole partnership shakes out. Rivian has introduced some very compelling tech and software with its electric R1S and R1T, and Volkswagen is very good at making cars at scale. It seems like a recipe for success. Nissan will have all of 2025 to figure out how to fix its finances, because after that it’ll hit a record bond maturity wall. The automaker has about $1.6 billion of debt due next year, which is somehow a slight decrease from 2024. However, that number jumps to $5.6 billion in 2026. That is... a lot. In fact, Bloomberg says its the highest debt bill it can find going back to 1996. From Bloomberg: The deluge of bond repayments comes as the company’s debt-default insurance costs climb to peaks last reached in March 2023 and yield premiums on yen and dollar bonds have risen to the highest levels this year. Nissan’s shares have swung wildly in recent days, tumbling after it slashed profit forecasts and 9,000 jobs, but jumping after one of the most influential activist investors in Japan took a stake in the company. In credit markets, speculation that the automaker may be cut to junk grade by more ratings firms has damaged investor sentiment. The election of Donald Trump as president also boosts the danger of the US increasing tariffs for exporters. “Under current conditions, Nissan may become a fallen angel, and when markets are aware of such a downgrade risk, investors may require spreads pricing in such risks,” said Kentaro Harada, chief credit analyst at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. Debt rating cuts may force Nissan out of investment-grade bond indexes, taking away funds from investors who only put their money in debt that’s included in those indices, he said. Nissan has sufficient liquidity, with over ¥1.3 trillion ($8.3 billion) in cash on a net basis in its automobile business at the end of September, said Shiro Nagai, a company spokesman. It also has committed credit facilities with major international banks to fund both automobile and sales finance businesses, with more than ¥1.9 trillion available at the end of September, Nagai said. I really cannot think of many automakers that would switch place with Nissan right now. At least it says it has “many sources” of funds to repay debt over the next five years. Those sources include available liquidity, automotive cash flows, dividends from its profitable auto financing business and new debt insurance. Nissan has a Baa3 rating from Moody’s and BBB- from Fitch Ratings, both the lowest investment grade, while S&P ranks it BB+, the highest junk score, Bloomberg-compiled data show. All of those ratings have a stable outlook, suggesting that changes aren’t imminent. One concern is that the company’s automotive division fell into a deficit in the April-September period in terms of cash flow that can be freely used for investments or to boost shareholder returns. The deficit of more than ¥440 billion in the six-month period was due to a decline in earnings and an increased investment burden, and the company will still need to develop next-generation technologies such as electric vehicles and autonomous driving in the coming years, the rating firm said. Nissan also has by far the biggest borrowings relative to its earnings among Japanese automakers. Its debt-to-earnings ratio before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, was 8 last quarter, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. That compares with 4.9 for Toyota Motor Corp., 4.7 for Honda Motor Co., and the average of 3.3 for companies in the Nikkei 225 Stock Average. The cost to insure against debt nonpayment by Nissan rose to about 178 basis points earlier this month, the highest since March 2023, CMA data show. Only three other major Japanese companies have riskier debt in CDS terms. Something else Nissan will have to contend with is the fact President-elect Trump wants to crack down on automakers building cars in Mexico by imposing tariffs over 200 percent on vehicles imported from the country. Mexico is, of course, a key manufacturing hub and market for Nissan. Hyundai has appointed Jose Munoz as its new president at chief executive officer. The move makes him the first foreign leader to ever head the Korean automaker as it looks to expand operations in the United States. Munoz, who currently heads the automaker’s U.S. operations, will replace Jaehoon Chang. He’ll become Hyundai’s vice chairman, effective January 1, 2025. From the Wall Street Journal: The reshuffle comes as the carmaker pushes into the U.S. market and grows its electric-vehicle business globally, even as some of its rivals scale back their EV efforts because of sluggish demand. Some market analysts caution that the carmaker’s ongoing EV efforts in the U.S., backed by the Biden administration’s clean energy policy, could be challenged by the incoming Trump administration, which campaigned against U.S. tax credits and subsidies for the EV industry. Hyundai is investing $12.6 billion in Georgia to produce more EVs and HEVs in the U.S. while also continuing to invest in new battery and hydrogen technology. North America was a rare bright spot in Hyundai’s third-quarter results. Wholesale car sales there rose 9.3% compared with the same period a year earlier. In contrast, global sales fell 3.2% amid sluggish vehicle demand in most major markets. Hyundai Motor said Munoz is “the ideal fit to further enhance the company’s performance thanks to his merit-based management philosophy and his commitment to recruiting top global talent.” Munoz, 59, a native of Spain and a U.S. citizen, first joined Hyundai Motor’s North America operations as its global chief operating officer in 2019. He was previously a chief performance officer at Japanese carmaker Nissan 7201 4.46%increase; green up pointing triangle Motor. “Through strengthening dealer competitiveness and driving profitability-focused management, he has continuously set record performance milestones for Hyundai Motor in North America,” the company said. Right now, Hyundai and Kia have captured about 10 percent of the U.S. EV market, which puts it only behind Tesla, the company says. It’s aim is to bring 21 different EVs to market and sell about 2 million of them annually by 2030. At the same time, it plans to double the number of hybrids it has to 14. Microsoft releases the Xbox gaming console on November 15, 2001, dramatically influencing the…

Double your support for intelligent, in-depth, trustworthy journalism. Follow 2024 live results Associated Press Associated Press Leave your feedback NEW YORK (AP) — Wall Street is already making big bets on what take two for a White House led by Donald Trump will mean for the economy. Since Election Day, investors have sent prices zooming for stocks of banks, fossil-fuel producers and other companies expected to benefit from Trump’s preference for lower tax rates and lighter regulation. For retailers, meanwhile, the outlook is murkier because of uncertainty about whether they’ll be able to absorb any of the higher costs created by tariffs. READ MORE: Biden spurred new factories and infrastructure projects. Trump will be in office for the ribbon-cutting Professional investors are warning about the risk of getting carried away by the momentum. While strong rhetoric on the campaign trail can cause these big swings, not all of the promises turn into actual policy. Plus, the broad U.S. stock market tends to move more on long-term growth in profits than anything else. — Stan Choe Here’s a look at where Wall Street is placing its bets at the moment. Technology stocks soared in Trump’s first term, helped by the administration’s tax policies. But the relationship was tempestuous: Trump’s immigration stance threatened a source of high-skilled immigrants that comprises a significant part of the industry’s work force and his trade wars threatened international sales and supply chains. This time around, tech could benefit from an anticipated loosening of antitrust regulation that discouraged big deals from getting done and threatened to rein in the power of Google, Apple and Amazon. What’s more, Trump is expected to clear the way for Big Tech to make more inroads in artificial intelligence technology — an area increasingly seen as a crucial battleground in the duel for global power between the U.S. and China. READ MORE: Trump promised to save TikTok, but what happens next is not clear Trump’s vow to impose tariffs and other restrictions on trade does pose a potential downside for chip makers, particularly stock market darling Nvidia. A possible rollback of Biden administration efforts to boost U.S. semiconductor production also is a concern. Still, in a sign of tech’s more conciliatory attitude, Trump’s election was greeted by congratulatory posts from most of the industry’s luminaries, including Apple CEO Tim Cook, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy and Google CEO Sundar Pichai. — Michael Liedtke Trump’s victory brings a big dose of uncertainty for the retail industry. Trump has proposed extending 2017 tax cuts for individuals and restoring tax breaks for businesses that were being reduced. He also wants to further cut the corporate tax rate. Those would be tailwinds for shoppers and businesses, analysts said. But the president-elect’s trade proposals could have a huge downside. He’s proposed 60% tariffs on Chinese goods and tariffs of 10% to 20% on other imports. Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, a research firm, said retailers would either take a big hit on profits or be forced to increase prices. As opposed to Trump’s first term, retailers will have a harder time absorbing tariffs this time because their costs of doing business are already higher, Saunders said. READ MORE: Stocks and bitcoin soar after Trump’s victory, while inflation worries rise; Dow surges 1,200 Many companies, including Nike and eyewear retailer Warby Parker, have been diversifying their sourcing away from China. Shoe brand Steve Madden says it plans to cut imports from China by as much as 45% next year. The National Retail Federation is forecasting higher prices for U.S. shoppers if Trump’s new tariffs are implemented. For example, an $80 pair of men’s jeans would cost $90 to $96. — Anne D’Innocenzio Trump has said he wants to “drill, drill, drill” starting on Day 1 of his presidency, so it’s expected that traditional fossil fuel-focused companies will get a boost and renewable energy outfits could be disadvantaged. Oilfield services companies including Haliburton and Schlumberger would likely benefit from initiatives to expand drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska. Natural gas companies including EQT and CNX Resources could benefit from facilities and pipeline projects. Meanwhile, clean energy companies, such as First Solar and many electric vehicle makers, could have a harder time growing if Trump cuts tax credits and other incentives for the industry. READ MORE: Top U.S. climate negotiator vows ‘we won’t revert back’ after Trump reelection But remember Trump’s first term, says Austin Pickle, investment strategy analyst at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. The thought back then, like now, was that Trump would boost prices for oil-and-gas stocks. But energy stocks ended up struggling late in his term when the price of oil briefly went below zero during the COVID-19 pandemic. — Damian Troise Drugmakers, insurers and other health care companies could benefit from fewer regulatory roadblocks to mergers and a lighter regulatory stance overall. Insurers, in particular, may see some regulatory relief for Medicare Advantage plans, which are privately run versions of the government’s Medicare program mainly for people ages 65 and older. Under Democratic leadership, some insurers were facing smaller bonus payments tied to their Medicare Advantage plans. Some drugmakers are facing revenue hits on certain drugs covered by Medicare. Those challenges could abate under Republican rule, analysts at Morningstar noted. A second Trump administration also may challenge health care companies. The approval of drugs and vaccines could become less predictable, depending on the role anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. plays, said Morningstar analyst Karen Andersen. Health insurers that sell coverage on the Affordable Care Act’s insurance marketplaces or manage state-and-federally funded Medicaid coverage could face challenges if Republicans attempt to dismantle parts of the law, said Julie Utterback of Morningstar. In particular, extra subsidies that help people buy marketplace coverage are slated to expire at the end of next year, which could lead to enrollment drops. — Tom Murphy The auto industry is another that should welcome less restrictive regulations but dread tariffs. Trump is likely to roll back or scrap tailpipe emissions limits for 2027 through 2032 imposed by the Biden administration. Companies like General Motors, Ford and Stellantis could more easily sell larger, less-efficient vehicles without paying hefty fines. Companies would also face less pressure to sell more electric vehicles to offset emissions from big trucks and SUVs, which make big profit margins, said Kevin Tynan, research director for The Presidio Group. Tariffs are a different story. Trump has threatened tariffs on imported vehicles to force more production in the U.S. The threat of 100% tariffs on vehicles imported from Mexico is a big concern. Morningstar analyst David Whiston said such tariffs could potentially cost General Motors, Stellantis and Ford billions in profits. About 30% of GM’s North American production comes from Mexico, while it’s 24% for Stellantis and about 15% for Ford. Whiston notes that tariffs on vehicles built in Mexico would violate the U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement negotiated during Trump’s first term. But that can be reworked in July of 2026. Whiston said those tariffs would mean higher prices and many buyers already can’t afford the current average price of over $47,000. Trump also has threatened to get rid of electric vehicle tax credits that have helped boost sales of EVs. — Tom Krisher Bank stocks could benefit if Trump’s policies boost the U.S. economy and more customers apply for loans. In addition, Wells Fargo banking analyst Mike Mayo believes the Trump victory can usher in a “new era” of lighter financial regulation after 15 years of stricter oversight following the financial crisis of 2008-2009. Under Biden, banks were facing requirements to set aside more capital to reduce risk, but the Trump administration is likely to take a step back. Dealmaking could see a revival under Trump, which would help banks with large investment banking operations like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. That also increases the odds the pending merger between Capital One Financial and Discover Financial gets federal clearance. Regional banks should benefit if a growing economy prompts the creation of new small businesses or the expansion of existing ones. — Paul Harloff Construction companies are looking at a mixed bag, with lighter regulations a plus but higher materials costs a potential minus. Construction companies, including homebuilders KB Home and PulteGroup, could benefit from tax incentives and more friendly regulations. A surge in development could help relieve some pressure on a housing market pressured by a lack of supply for new homes. A boost in construction could also help suppliers of raw materials including steel and aggregates used in concrete. But the potential for overall raw material price increases is a threat. Higher costs could cut into profits for construction companies and homebuilders. Steel tariffs could help shield U.S. producers from competition, but a jump in global prices as a result could negate that benefit, while also squeezing construction companies. Plans for an immigration crackdown could worsen an existing labor shortage and result in delays for projects. — Damian Troise Trump, once a crypto skeptic, has pledged to make the U.S. “the crypto capital of the planet” and create a “strategic reserve” of bitcoin. Money has poured into crypto assets since he won. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, has surged above $86,000. Shares of crypto platform Coinbase have surged more than 60% since the election. Crypto industry players welcomed Trump’s victory, in hopes that he would push through legislative and regulatory changes that they’ve long lobbied for. And Trump had promised that, if elected, he would remove the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler, who has been leading the U.S. government’s crackdown on the crypto industry and repeatedly called for more oversight. — Wyatte Grantham-Phillips Left: Photo by Andrew Kelly/ Reuters By Josh Boak, Associated Press By Seth Borenstein, Melina Walling, Associated Press By Haleluya Hadero, Associated Press By Seth Borenstein, Melina Walling, Sibi Arasu, Associated Press By Thomas Beaumont, Associated Press By Associated Press By Stan Choe, Associated Press Associated Press Associated Press Support Provided By: Learn more Support PBS News: Subscribe to Here’s the Deal, our politics newsletter for analysis you won’t find anywhere else.

A boost in construction could also help suppliers of raw materials including steel and aggregates used in concrete. But the potential for overall raw material price increases is a threat. Higher costs could cut into profits for construction companies and homebuilders.

Crypto industry players welcomed Trump’s victory, in hopes that he would push through legislative and regulatory changes that they’ve long lobbied for. And Trump had promised that, if elected, he would remove the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler, who has been leading the U.S. government’s crackdown on the crypto industry and repeatedly called for more oversight. — Wyatte Grantham-Phillips 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Wall Street is already making big bets on what take two for a White House led by Donald Trump will mean for the economy and markets NEW YORK -- Wall Street is already making big bets on what take two for a White House led by Donald Trump will mean for the economy. Since Election Day, investors have sent prices zooming for stocks of banks, fossil-fuel producers and other companies expected to benefit from Trump’s preference for lower tax rates and lighter regulation. For retailers, meanwhile, the outlook is murkier because of uncertainty about whether they’ll be able to absorb any of the higher costs created by tariffs. Professional investors are warning about the risk of getting carried away by the momentum. While strong rhetoric on the campaign trail can cause these big swings, not all of the promises turn into actual policy. Plus, the broad U.S. stock market tends to move more on long-term growth in profits than anything else. — Stan Choe Here's a look at where Wall Street is placing its bets at the moment: Technology stocks soared in Trump’s first term, helped by the administration’s tax policies. But the relationship was tempestuous: Trump’s immigration stance threatened a source of high-skilled immigrants that comprises a significant part of the industry’s work force and his trade wars threatened international sales and supply chains. This time around, tech could benefit from an anticipated loosening of antitrust regulation that discouraged big deals from getting done and threatened to rein in the power of Google, Apple and Amazon. What’s more, Trump is expected to clear the way for Big Tech to make more inroads in artificial intelligence technology — an area increasingly seen as a crucial battleground in the duel for global power between the U.S. and China. Trump’s vow to impose tariffs and other restrictions on trade does pose a potential downside for chip makers, particularly stock market darling Nvidia. A possible rollback of Biden administration efforts to boost U.S. semiconductor production also is a concern. Still, in a sign of tech’s more conciliatory attitude, Trump’s election was greeted by congratulatory posts from most of the industry’s luminaries, including Apple CEO Tim Cook, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy and Google CEO Sundar Pichai. — Michael Liedtke Trump’s victory brings a big dose of uncertainty for the retail industry. Trump has proposed extending 2017 tax cuts for individuals and restoring tax breaks for businesses that were being reduced. He also wants to further cut the corporate tax rate. Those would be tailwinds for shoppers and businesses, analysts said. But the president-elect’s trade proposals could have a huge downside. He’s proposed 60% tariffs on Chinese goods and tariffs of 10% to 20% on other imports. Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, a research firm, said retailers would either take a big hit on profits or be forced to increase prices. As opposed to Trump’s first term, retailers will have a harder time absorbing tariffs this time because their costs of doing business are already higher, Saunders said. Many companies, including Nike and eyewear retailer Warby Parker, have been diversifying their sourcing away from China. Shoe brand Steve Madden says it plans to cut imports from China by as much as 45% next year. The National Retail Federation is forecasting higher prices for U.S. shoppers if Trump’s new tariffs are implemented. For example, an $80 pair of men’s jeans would cost $90 to $96. — Anne D'Innocenzio Trump has said he wants to “drill, drill, drill” starting on Day 1 of his presidency, so it’s expected that traditional fossil fuel-focused companies will get a boost and renewable energy outfits could be disadvantaged. Oilfield services companies including Haliburton and Schlumberger would likely benefit from initiatives to expand drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska. Natural gas companies including EQT and CNX Resources could benefit from facilities and pipeline projects. Meanwhile, clean energy companies, such as First Solar and many electric vehicle makers, could have a harder time growing if Trump cuts tax credits and other incentives for the industry. But remember Trump’s first term, says Austin Pickle, investment strategy analyst at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. The thought back then, like now, was that Trump would boost prices for oil-and-gas stocks. But energy stocks ended up struggling late in his term when the price of oil briefly went below zero during the COVID-19 pandemic. — Damian Troise Drugmakers, insurers and other health care companies could benefit from fewer regulatory roadblocks to mergers and a lighter regulatory stance overall. Insurers, in particular, may see some regulatory relief for Medicare Advantage plans, which are privately run versions of the government’s Medicare program mainly for people ages 65 and older. Under Democratic leadership, some insurers were facing smaller bonus payments tied to their Medicare Advantage plans. Some drugmakers are facing revenue hits on certain drugs covered by Medicare. Those challenges could abate under Republican rule, analysts at Morningstar noted. A second Trump administration also may challenge health care companies. The approval of drugs and vaccines could become less predictable, depending on the role anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. plays, said Morningstar analyst Karen Andersen. Health insurers that sell coverage on the Affordable Care Act’s insurance marketplaces or manage state-and-federally funded Medicaid coverage could face challenges if Republicans attempt to dismantle parts of the law, said Julie Utterback of Morningstar. In particular, extra subsidies that help people buy marketplace coverage are slated to expire at the end of next year, which could lead to enrollment drops. — Tom Murphy The auto industry is another that should welcome less restrictive regulations but dread tariffs. Trump is likely to roll back or scrap tailpipe emissions limits for 2027 through 2032 imposed by the Biden administration. Companies like General Motors, Ford and Stellantis could more easily sell larger, less-efficient vehicles without paying hefty fines. Companies would also face less pressure to sell more electric vehicles to offset emissions from big trucks and SUVs, which make big profit margins, said Kevin Tynan, research director for The Presidio Group. Tariffs are a different story. Trump has threatened tariffs on imported vehicles to force more production in the U.S. The threat of 100% tariffs on vehicles imported from Mexico is a big concern. Morningstar analyst David Whiston said such tariffs could potentially cost General Motors, Stellantis and Ford billions in profits. About 30% of GM’s North American production comes from Mexico, while it’s 24% for Stellantis and about 15% for Ford. Whiston notes that tariffs on vehicles built in Mexico would violate the U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement negotiated during Trump’s first term. But that can be reworked in July of 2026. Whiston said those tariffs would mean higher prices and many buyers already can’t afford the current average price of over $47,000. Trump also has threatened to get rid of electric vehicle tax credits that have helped boost sales of EVs. — Tom Krisher Bank stocks could benefit if Trump's policies boost the U.S. economy and more customers apply for loans. In addition, Wells Fargo banking analyst Mike Mayo believes the Trump victory can usher in a “new era” of lighter financial regulation after 15 years of stricter oversight following the financial crisis of 2008-2009. Under Biden, banks were facing requirements to set aside more capital to reduce risk, but the Trump administration is likely to take a step back. Dealmaking could see a revival under Trump, which would help banks with large investment banking operations like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. That also increases the odds the pending merger between Capital One Financial and Discover Financial gets federal clearance. Regional banks should benefit if a growing economy prompts the creation of new small businesses or the expansion of existing ones. — Paul Harloff Construction companies are looking at a mixed bag, with lighter regulations a plus but higher materials costs a potential minus. Construction companies, including homebuilders KB Home and PulteGroup, could benefit from tax incentives and more friendly regulations.

Shares of the Detroit automaker have risen 54.7% ahead of Monday's opening, outperforming legacy competitors, Tesla, and U.S. electric vehicle startups Lucid Group and Rivian Automotive. "You may still not believe it, but it's true, GM keeps on trucking," BofA Securities analysts John Murphy wrote in an investor note in October after the automaker beat Wall Street's third-quarter expectations. GM has done so with the assistance of $12.4 billion in stock buybacks since last November, which the automaker said will continue for the foreseeable future. But it's also proving itself to be operationally better than its crosstown rivals Ford Motor and Chrysler parent Stellantis, as well as other sector peers. CEO and Chair Mary Barra has touted that kind of differentiation for years, but it has largely fallen upon deaf ears. For the most part, GM stock has traded in lockstep with Ford due to their histories and the cyclical nature of the automotive industry. But not this year. Ford stock is off 10% as of Friday's close. Others, including Ferrari, which has been among Wall Street's top auto performers, are also trailing GM. Even with shares of Tesla surging more than 30% during the past week following President-elect Donald Trump winning the U.S. presidential election, the electric vehicle maker continues to trail GM. Tesla CEO Elon Musk heavily campaigned for Trump. GM, unlike many competitors, has not lowered its 2024 guidance or underperformed Wall Street's quarterly earnings expectations. Instead, it's actually raised key financial targets despite facing ongoing market challenges in the U.S. and its Chinese operations losing hundreds of millions of dollars amid increased competition. While GM has said it's cutting costs, it has not had to be as aggressive as other automakers this year. Nissan, Volkswagen and Stellantis are conducting massive business restructurings that include layoffs, production cuts and other cost-saving measures. Shares of GM under Barra, who started leading the automaker in January 2014, have been lackluster for investors for most of her tenure. The stock's average closing price under her tenure is $38 per share — lower than the $40.02 per share closing price before she became CEO, according to FactSet data. Cumulative, as of Friday's close, shares are up 38.9% under Barra's tenure. That compares with a nearly 300% increase for the S&P 500 during that time frame. GM's all-time high stock price under Barra was $67.21 on Jan. 5, 2022, as Barra presented GM's EV ambitions and growth plans. Whether GM can continue its hot streak going into next year is yet to be seen, but the automaker has advised it expects the 2025 performance of the company to be in line with this year, including signaling a weaker fourth quarter. Barra, when discussing quarterly earnings Oct. 22, reiterated her stance that GM will continue to "build on our competitive strength and deliver the performance that differentiates us from others in the industry." "We're going to be disciplined and we'll be resilient, and we'll make adjustments to the extent that we can to continue to drive growth and profitability," Barra said. "In the weeks and months ahead, you'll see more clearly than ever how we intend to leverage the tailwinds that are within our control to deliver strong results in 2025 that are in a similar range to 2024." GM stock on average is weighted overweight with a price target of $59.85 per share, according to average Wall Street estimates compiled by FactSet. Got a confidential news tip?
