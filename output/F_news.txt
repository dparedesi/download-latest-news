Summary: This AI company could reach trillions of dollars in market capitalization.
Content: Artificial intelligence (AI) is probably one of the biggest trends that will change our daily lives in the coming decades. While AI is still in its early development stage, companies like Nvidia and Palantir have already seen an impact on their business growth in recent quarters.
Still, some winners have yet to make money from selling AI-related services and products but are well-positioned to do so in the future. Tesla (TSLA -2.33%), one of the leading technology companies of our generation, is among those companies.

From EV to autonomous driving
Tesla, arguably, has contributed more to the automotive industry than any incumbent car maker since Ford Motor Company introduced its Model T in the early 1900s. The EV maker almost single-handedly drove the mass adoption of electric cars in the U.S. when most of the incumbents were skeptical of the potential of EV cars.
And while the EV transition will probably take decades to complete, the tech company is now riding on an even more significant trend of autonomous driving. According to McKinsey & Company, passenger car advanced driver-assistance and autonomous driving systems could generate $300 to $400 billion in revenue by 2035. And that's just revenue from selling these systems. The rise of autonomous driving systems could also open up other business opportunities for Tesla, such as launching a robotaxi service.
There are good reasons to believe that Tesla is a front-runner well-positioned to grab a decent, if not substantial, market share in this emerging industry. For instance, Tesla has a huge fleet of vehicles (in the millions) that are constantly generating real-world driving data. This massive (and ever-growing) data set helps train Tesla's models used to develop autonomous driving software, allowing the tech company to maintain its leadership in the autonomous driving race.





Besides, Tesla's vertical integration from manufacturing cars to designing its software and chips gives i

Title: Should You Buy the 3 Highest-Paying Dividend Stocks in the S&P 500?
URL: https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/09/17/should-you-buy-highest-paying-dividend-stocks/
Time Published: 20240917T200822
Summary: Dividend stocks could get more attention as interest rates fall.
Content: Dividend stocks could soon get a closer look from investors. That's because the Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates on Wednesday, beginning a new cycle of lower rates, which will bring down Treasury yields and interest rates on savings accounts.
That process makes dividend stocks more attractive. Dividend stocks are likely to move higher as bond yields fall because bond investors will rotate back into dividend stocks in search of yield.
If you're looking for dividend stocks, a good place to start your search is the S&P 500. Let's take a look at the three highest-yielding dividend stocks in the broad-market index today.

1. Walgreens Boots Alliance (dividend yield: 11.1%)
If you're a dividend investor, it's important to understand the difference between a high-yield stock and a yield trap, and Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA -3.01%) looks like a classic example of a yield trap.
Shares of the pharmacy chain are down a whopping 65% year to date, declining steadily as it's struggled with a loss of COVID-related revenue, narrowing margins in its pharmacy business, an ongoing decline in the retail business, and challenges related to the misguided acquisition of VillageMD, a primary care clinic, which has led to significant losses in the business.






According to conventional metrics, Walgreens now looks dirt cheap, trading at a forward P/E of just above 3, but that's based on adjusted earnings. However, that likely reflects investor fears over more write-downs and falling profits in the coming quarter. In fact, the company has taken impairment charges of $13.6 billion this year, mostly related to its acquisition of VillageMD.
It also had a negative free cash flow of $1.5 billion this year. 
Walgreens could be forced to cut its dividend again, and the company seems likely to be removed from the S&P 500 soon as its market cap falls below $8 billion. The stock is best avoided.
2. Altria (dividend yield: 7.9%)
Altria Group (MO 0.32%) was one

Content: MONTREAL, Sept.  17, 2024  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Stingray (TSX: RAY.A; RAY.B), a leading music, media, and technology company, is launching Stingray Karaoke in Ford Motor Company’s vehicles – starting with the all-electric F-150® Lightning® and Mustang Mach-E, and coming soon to vehicles with the Ford and Lincoln Digital Experience. This will be the first time karaoke is available for Ford owners to use and enjoy inside the vehicle while parked and on the go. While owners are parked or waiting for their vehicle to charge, they will be able to view the lyrics of the song they have selected on the in-vehicle screen so everyone in the vehicle can participate in the fun.  This unique experience was developed in collaboration between the Stingray and Ford engineering teams. Here’s how it works: While driving, if the in-vehicle app is opened and the vehicle detects a passenger is in the front seat and buckled, the app will ask for confirmation that a passenger is in the front seat and a QR code will appear.* The passenger can use their smartphone to scan the QR code and a web page will open to control the karaoke experience from their smartphone without having to login to an app. Passengers can add songs to their playlist, change songs, view scrolling lyrics and utilize the vehicle’s audio system. "Expanding Stingray's entertainment services to Ford vehicles marks a significant step in our mission to enrich the in-car experience," said Jim Riley, President, US Division at Stingray. "The debut of Stingray Karaoke in Ford vehicles underscores Stingray's dedication to bringing innovative solutions to the automotive industry to engage customers at a time when consumers are expecting a richer entertainment experience in their vehicle." Owners and their passengers can easily find songs by searching by title, artist, lyrics, era or genre. There is also a wide selection of songs and music styles from Rock, Country, Pop, R&B, Latin, K&J Pop and family-friendly tunes for all ages. Th
