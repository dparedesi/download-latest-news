The average price of a new car was $48,397 in September, according to Kelley Blue Book. Dealer discounts and other incentives fell this past summer, keeping prices relatively stable.

The prices of electric vehicles (EVs) also have risen recently, though they’re still 0.9% lower than they were in September 2023. If you’re in the market for a new vehicle, or you’re thinking of selling one you already own, it helps to know what’s ranking high and what’s not. Here are eight car models that could have significant price drops in November, according to automotive experts. Also see reliable cars to buy before winter. Typical starting MSRP: $27,415 “I can say that the Toyota Camry has been a reliable and popular sedan, but with the 2024 model already out, the 2023 version is likely to see discounts, especially if dealerships are trying to clear inventory,” said Joe Giranda, director of sales and marketing for CFR Classic. “It’s a solid car; but, when newer models come in, prices naturally drop.” For added context, the 2025 model has a starting MSRP of $28,400. Given that the price difference is marginal, the older models might need to be marked down to sell.

Suze Orman Says You're Missing This Key Money Move Typical starting MSRP: $29,495 With many consumers switching to more compact vehicles, the Ford Escape might lose value. “The Ford Escape has been facing strong competition in the compact SUV market,” Giranda said. “I believe that dealers will likely offer good discounts on the 2023 model to make room for newer stock, particularly with the growing preference for electric and hybrid SUVs.” The 2025 model has a starting MSRP of $27,995 to $38,400. For You: These 10 Used Cars Will Last Longer Than an Average New Vehicle Typical starting MSRP: $28,390 “Much like the Camry, I think the 2023 Honda Accord will see price cuts,” Giranda said. “Honda is set to release its 2024 lineup, so dealers will be pushing to clear the older models to make space for the new ones.” If this happens, the older vehicles likely will see markdowns. As dealerships take on even newer models, older ones could drop even more. Typical starting MSRP: $83,890 The Cadillac Escalade has a history of depreciating by roughly 40% in the first five years. It also often has issues when it comes to things like the dashboard and brake fluid leaks. “Buyers are becoming more aware of vehicle depreciation and reliability and they’re not as willing to pay a high price for a name or status,” said Melanie Musson, an auto industry expert with CarInsurance.org. “So, Escalades will likely have to lower their price to keep buyers buying.” Plus, the Cadillac Escalade 2025 has a starting MSRP of $89,590. If the 2024 model stays in high demand, its price could remain stable. Otherwise, it could drop. Typical starting MSRP: $34,095 The Fiat 500e is reasonably priced right now, but Musson is concerned it will drop in price due to its low range of about 80 to 120 miles. “Some people wouldn’t even be able to complete a round-trip commute with that range,” she said. “They’re not popular, so sales are stagnant. A price drop could get them moving again.” Read More: 4 Affordable Car Brands You Won’t Regret Buying in 2024 Typical starting MSRP: $27,495 Giranda noted that the Chevrolet Bolt EV is a solid contender as far as EVs go. But with newer models coming out each year and consumers expecting the latest tech, its pricing could see a downward trend. “I believe that 2023 models will drop in price as consumers shift towards more up-to-date options,” he said. Typical starting MSRP: $62,995 EVs might be popular — though perhaps not with every consumer — but the Ford Lightning could lose value as the end of the year approaches. “The public is not as enamored with EVs as predicted, especially when it comes to those looking for a truck,” Musson said. “Most people buy trucks because they need the capabilities a truck can give them for towing and hauling. An EV truck will have drastically lower range when towing. Buyers don’t like that.” Typical starting MSRP: $29,230 Giranda also predicted that the 2023 Nissan Rogue will have a notable price drop as dealerships start bringing in newer models. Not only that, but as the industry gears more toward hybrid and electric vehicles, traditional gas-powered SUVs like the Rogue might lose their appeal. Like other cars on this list, the difference in price points between the older model (2023) and the newest one (2025) is almost negligible. The 2025 Nissan Rogue is expected to be priced at about $30,620. Given this, dealerships could reduce prices for the older vehicles on their lot to make room for the new.

Title: F, GM, or STLA: Which Traditional Automaker Is the Best Investment Choice?

Time Published: 2024-10-15T06:47:30Z

In this article, I will use the TipRanks Stock Comparison Tool to analyze traditional automakers, including Ford (F), General Motors (GM), and Stellantis (STLA). A closer look suggests a neutral stance on Ford, while a bullish outlook for both GM and Stellantis. However, if I had to choose one, I believe investing in General Motors is the best option compared to the other two, which I will discuss next. I have a neutral view on Ford, the legacy U.S. automaker that has undergone significant restructuring to enhance profitability and resilience amid industry volatility. However, the company’s latest results have disappointed due to ongoing quality and warranty issues, a complex transition to electric vehicles, and a general lack of investor confidence. Ford reported a significant EPS miss for Q2, coming in at 47 cents when analysts expected 68 cents. This marks the third consecutive quarter of sharp year-over-year declines, primarily driven by warranty costs. Additionally, Ford Blue, the segment focused on internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, reported an adjusted EBIT of $1.2 billion, down 48% from the previous year. It should be noted that warranty costs have plagued Ford for years, affecting its reputation for quality and reliability. In 2023, the company had 5.9 million vehicles recalled, the highest of any U.S. automaker. These financial losses, coupled with rising warranty claims, suggest a troubling lack of quality in Ford’s combustion vehicles. I refrain from taking a bearish stance on Ford because there are positive developments. Promisingly, CEO Jim Farley indicated that warranty issues are expected to be resolved soon, with plans to invest in advanced technologies and improve testing protocols to significantly reduce these problems by 2025. Also, after suspending its dividend during the pandemic, Ford reinstated it in 2021, signaling confidence in its financial health and sustainable cash flow. This makes Ford attractive to income-oriented investors, with a dividend yield of 7.43% and a payout ratio of 47.5%. Valuations also favor Ford, trading at a forward P/E ratio of 5.6x, about 30% below its five-year average. At TipRanks, Wall Street consensus rates Ford as a Moderate Buy. The average price target is $14.40, suggesting a potential upside of 34.33%. I have an optimistic outlook on General Motors, one of the largest automakers and a leader in vehicle electrification, thanks to its strong sales growth and aggressive push toward electric vehicles. As a result, GM has outperformed nearly all of its competitors this year. In Q2, GM reported strong results, particularly in its internal combustion engine (ICE) trucks and SUVs, marking its eighth consecutive quarter of beating EPS estimates with $3.06 per share—a 60.2% year-over-year increase. The company achieved $4.4 billion in adjusted EBIT, up 37% from last year, prompting a $500 million increase in full-year guidance to between $13 billion and $15 billion. Much of the bullish investment thesis for General Motors hinges on its commitment to scaling Electric Vehicle (EV) initiatives. While GM previously pledged to electrify 50% of its fleet by 2030 and 100% by 2035, management now indicates that these goals will be guided by consumer demand. Moreover, I believe one reason GM stock has outperformed its peers is that the company grew revenues by nearly 5% year-over-year, compared to the industry average of 2%. Additionally, GM’s EBIT increased by 4.2%, while the industry average was just 1.8%. In contrast, peers like Ford and Stellantis reported EBIT declines of 55% and 27%, respectively. GM’s dividend yield is just under 1%, much less attractive than Ford’s. However, the company has repurchased about $11.5 billion worth of shares over the past twelve months, resulting in a buyback yield of around 21.6%, compared to 1.3% for Ford. Additionally, GM trades at a forward P/E ratio of 4.8x, nearly 40% below its historical average, despite a roughly 55% stock appreciation over the past year. At TipRanks, the Wall Street consensus rates GM as a Moderate Buy, with an average price target of $57, suggesting an upside of 19.07%. I hold a cautiously bullish view of Stellantis, which, despite poor performance this year, is undergoing a transitional period in its product cycle. Formed in 2021 from the merger of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) and Peugeot Groupe, Stellantis has a diverse portfolio of 14 iconic brands. Recent results have disappointed the market. After a record year in 2023 with net revenue, net profit, and free cash flow all at new highs, the company reported yearly declines of 14% in revenue and 38% in net profit for H1 2024. Concerns about Stellantis’ investment thesis stem from its transitional phase. The company plans to invest $50 billion over the next decade in battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), averaging $8.3 billion annually. However, Stellantis has been consistently reporting cash operations exceeding $20 billion, providing positive free cash flow for dividends and buybacks. Despite its recent disappointing results, several factors make me optimistic that the current bearishness surrounding Stellantis could present a good entry point for investors. First, the company demonstrates strong capital efficiency with a return on total capital of 9.7%, well above the industry average of 6.1%, Ford’s 1.1%, and GM’s 3.7%. This efficiency, driven by streamlined operations and a focus on high-margin vehicles, bodes well for its transition to fleet electrification. Additionally, Stellantis offers a dividend yield of 10.4% with a payout ratio of 41.5%. However, the company plans to reduce this to a 25-30% payout ratio for 2025, likely leading to a decline in the yield. On a positive note, Stellantis’ valuation is attractive, trading at a forward P/E ratio of 4.1x, which is lower than those of Ford and GM. According to TipRanks, the Wall Street consensus rates STLA as a Moderate Buy. The average price target is $21, suggesting an upside of 61.41%. I believe GM’s current momentum inspires more confidence than that of Ford and Stellantis. Despite offering a modest dividend yield, GM delivers compelling returns to shareholders through buybacks and still trades at an attractive valuation. Furthermore, GM has significantly outperformed its peers, demonstrating robust earnings results that have led to improved annual guidance. Disclosure Disclaimer Sign in to access your portfolio

We recently published a list of 8 Stocks Under $20 To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) stands against other under $20 stocks to invest in now. There has been a lot of discussion happening lately regarding the economy and the markets. While the economy was doing great with the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates and analysts expecting the markets to continue the bullish outlook, the recent geopolitical circumstances have again created doubt among investors. We recently covered an article about 10 Stocks Under $10 With High Potential, where we talked about how the market is expected to perform if the geopolitical situation escalates. Tom Lee, managing partner and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, mentioned that he would be buying the dip if the market goes there and also presented his bullish thesis regarding how the market tends to perform well after such tensions. Here’s an excerpt from the article: “Tom Lee, managing partner and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, appeared on CNBC to discuss what the stock market looks like in the current geopolitically tense environment. Lee has been bullish on small caps for a long time however, he has also remained cautious regarding some bumps in the start before the market for small caps starts to rise. He maintained a bullish stance, projecting a year-end target of 6,000 for the S&P 500, despite acknowledging potential short-term volatility due to upcoming events like the election and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. He emphasized that current market conditions are tricky, with headline risks stemming from a potential port strike that could impact the economy. Lee suggested that if a significant dip occurs, it would be a good opportunity to buy, as he believes the long-term outlook remains positive despite temporary setbacks. Talking about how the market has performed during wars in the past. Lee noted that historically, market reactions to geopolitical conflicts have often been more positive than anticipated. He cited past conflicts where buying during initial downturns proved beneficial, except for the recent Russia-Ukraine war which went otherwise due to concurrent Federal Reserve tightening.” Building upon how the market is progressing, Larry Adam, chief investment officer at Raymond James, says that the current market is exactly what a soft landing looks like. Adam recently appeared in an interview on CNBC to talk about how the lower interest rates will benefit the small caps in particular the Russell 2000. He believes that the bull market will continue while the economy inches towards a soft landing. When it comes to small-cap stocks they get around 56% of their financing from the short end of the curve. The short end of the curve refers to the short-term interest rate on the yield curve, which typically represents the yields on bonds with shorter maturities, such as 2-year or 5-year Treasury notes. Whereas the large-cap companies get only 26% financing from these short ends of the curve. Therefore, Adam believes that as the Fed continue to lower interest rates it will help small caps meet financing needs. He further pointed out that it is expected that the Fed will cut twice this year and another four times the next year. Another reason why he likes small caps is because the economy going towards a soft landing. Adam emphasized that we have already seen that the rate cuts helped small caps outperform the large caps. Historically speaking whenever the economy has a soft landing it typically helps the small caps greater than the rest of the market. Moreover, while mentioning his favorite sectors, Adam likes technology, healthcare, and industrials in both the small caps and large caps categories. While reasoning his interests in these sectors, he mentioned earnings in these sectors to be one of the prominent likable factors. Technology has been the only sector in the large caps category that has seen upward revisions. Moreover, the cash flow that these sectors are generating is being utilized in buybacks, paying dividends, and future growth expansions.
