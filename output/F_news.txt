The 2024 Jeep Grand Cherokee is being offered with cash rebates as rich as $9,000 this month. Experts agree that the coming days are traditionally among the best of the year in which to go shopping for a new car, truck or SUV. The week between Christmas and New Year’s Day in particular is traditionally the period in which car shoppers can strike some of the sweetest new-car deals. Specifically, those who go out car shopping on New Year’s Eve can expect to obtain the deepest discounts of the month, with the next-best day being Christmas Eve, when few patrons tend to come walking through a dealership’s door. Already automakers are touting their holiday/year-end clearance sales promotions, with dealerships and salespeople expected to go all out to strike deals to both clear excess inventory and to qualify for bonuses for meeting year-end sales goals. The idea here is to capitalize on consumers who may still be in a spending mood, especially facing January and February, which are typically slower sales months. I scoured carmakers’ websites and found generous cash rebates to be the rule, rather than the exception as the calendar approaches 2025. Here, I’m listing 46 of the richest cash-back deals of $3,000 or more below that are good through the end of the year. The most money I found being slapped on the hood is on the 2024 Jeep Grand Cherokee, with rebates as large as $9,000. Many of the biggest cash-back deals are on electric vehicles, with several automakers offering $7,500 rebates on their batter-powered wares to level the proverbial playing field on models that do not otherwise qualify for the one-time federal tax credit. Otherwise, the biggest incentives tend to be among vehicles remaining in stock from the 2024 model-year, though several factory-fresh 2025 vehicles are nonetheless represented. Unfortunately, those looking for a deal on one of last-year’s models may have to settle on an unpopular color or feature combination, depending on what’s still remaining in inventory. There are also additional spiffs on some models, such as Ford offering a complimentary home charger and installation on its F-150 Lightning full-size electric pickup truck and the Mustang Mach-E electric SUV. Automakers typically also offer extra rebates to recent college graduates, first responders and military members, as well as those currently owning or leasing a model from a qualifying brand. Note that the cash rebate offers cited below are in addition to the dealer’s discount, which should be generous on outgoing 2014 vehicles, as time is money in the new-car business. Be sure to factor in the value of a manufacturer’s cash rebate or promotional discount only after you’ve reached an agreeable transaction price with a salesperson. This is where a little advance research can go a long way. Start by visiting an online pricing site to determine the manufacturer’s suggested retail price (MSRP) and establish a “target price” for any vehicle under consideration, including options. Traditionally this would be what’s noted as the “invoice price,” which is actually a few percent higher than the dealership’s actual cost. In some cases, especially with luxury-branded cars that aren’t usually sold with cash rebates, it could be a lot less. Automakers often offer their dealers what are often called “secret rebates” to enable additional room for deeper discounts as needed. However, be aware that automakers’ incentives often vary by region to address local supply and demand issues, and sometimes vary from one model’s trim level to another, so be sure to check a manufacturer’s website, usually under a “local offers” or “special deals” tab to confirm what’s being offered locally. In some cases you’ll find cash rebates combined with low, or even zero percent financing offers, which we’re featuring in a separate post. One Community. Many Voices.
