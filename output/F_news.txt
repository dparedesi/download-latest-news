Title: Tesla Cybertruck Becomes The Third Best-Selling EV In The US

Tesla’s Cybertruck continues to make headlines, as it becomes the third best-selling EV in the US beating all other non-Tesla models. Only the Model 3 and Model Y sold more units. This achievement is even more impressive considering how the Cybertruck was selling at it’s highest price point with the most expensive trim. It’s clear that major automakers like Ford and GM are struggling to compete in the EV market. Tech Crunch reports that Ford only sold around 7,000 F-150 Lightnings and 13,000 Mustang Mach-E SUVs last quarter, while GM sold a total of 32,000 electric vehicles. Rivian’s electric pickup sales were even lower, at around 3,800 units. Tesla’s financial results for the third quarter were impressive, with the company generating $25.2 billion in sales and notching a $2.2 billion profit. The Cybertruck’s positive gross margin and the sale of regulatory credits to other automakers certainly helped boost profits. Additionally, Tesla’s cost-cutting measures have reduced the cost of goods sold per vehicle to $35,100. Investors are taking notice, as Tesla’s stock price jumped over 9% in after-hours trading. However, not all aspects of the business are thriving. Tesla’s Supercharger growth has slowed to 20% year-over-year, likely due to the company-wide layoff earlier this year. Despite this, Tesla remains a dominant force in the EV market.

Title: Tesla Stock Is on Track for its Best Day in a Decade

Tesla (TSLA) stock notched its best day in more than a decade on Thursday after the electric vehicle maker topped earnings estimates and promised a lower-cost model would begin production early next year. Tesla shares soared 22% Thursday, their biggest one-day gain since May 2013 when the company reported $500 million in quarterly sales for the first time. In the most recent quarter, vehicle sales exceeded $20 billion. Tesla's surging stock lifted the S&P 500's Automobiles Industry Index, which advanced more than 18% Thursday. Shares of other automakers were mixed, with General Motors (GM) slipping and Ford (F) advancing. Uber (UBER) shares slid nearly 2%; its stock surged to a record high earlier this month when Tesla's robotaxi rollout failed to convince investors it posed a threat to the ride-sharing giant. The company on Wednesday night reported automotive profit margins improved for the first time since early 2022. The profitability of the company’s core car business has been under pressure for years amid a price war in China and sluggish U.S. demand. CEO Elon Musk assured analysts on the company’s earnings call that “plans for new vehicles, including more affordable models, remain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025.” Musk has long said a lower-cost model is on the way, but his enthusiasm this year for robotaxis and AI has raised doubts on Wall Street about his commitment to that plan. Musk outlined other ambitious goals for Tesla on the call, including making it the world’s most valuable company “by a long shot” and achieving “vehicle growth” of 20% to 30% next year. Tesla’s total car sales are down 2% so far this year compared with 2023. Update—Oct. 24, 2024: This story was updated after markets closed on Thursday to reflect Tesla's closing share price.

Title: Europe’s Electric Vehicle Woes Are a Lesson for EVs Everywhere

Time Published: 2024-10-24T10:00:00Z

Electric cars got top billing at this year’s Paris Auto Show. At the world’s largest such showcase, a central exhibition hall featured an “electric factory” display designed, in the colors of the French flag, to mimic the spine-like assembly lines that churn out electric cars and internal combustion engines. Along the exteriors of those lines were a series of questions answered inside them, where clumps of teens on school trips and car enthusiasts stood by ready to hear the answers: Are electric vehicles produced in France? What new professions are created by electric vehicle production? Just outside the exhibition grounds, autoworkers who spend their days in real-world auto factories had a question of their own: Why are so many of them losing their jobs? A few hundred trade unionists from France, Italy, the United States, and elsewhere gathered in the rain to rail against Stellantis chief Carlos Tavares, the embattled CEO whose global auto group is fending off accusations of mismanagement from workers and investors alike. Late last month, Stellantis issued a profit warning amid lower than expected sales “across most regions.” The company has temporarily suspended production of its fully electric Fiat 500e, citing low sales as it temporarily lays off workers in Italy; Stellantis plans to start producing a hybrid version of the car in 2025 or 2026. Similarly, in the United States, the company has blamed “market conditions” to backtrack on a pledge—enshrined in its contract with the UAW—to reopen and expand an idled plant in Belvidere, Illinois, to include a $3.2 billion battery plant. Stellantis recently announced too that it will expand production of its bestselling, gas-powered Dodge RAM pickups in Mexico. Starting on October 12, it began laying off approximately 1,100 workers from its Warren Truck Assembly Plant in Michigan after ending production of the RAM 1500 Classic pickup there. On October 18, Stellantis workers in Italy carried out a 24-hour nationwide strike, culminating in a rally that brought an estimated 20,000 people out to Rome’s Piazza del Popolo. UAW members recently authorized their own strike against Stellantis, and are in tense negotiations with the company over unrealized investment commitments. The company has filed nine federal lawsuits against the UAW and two dozen locals disputing the union’s contract-violation claims and right to strike over them, arguing the pledge was always “contingent upon plant performance, changes in market conditions and consumer demand.” Amid all this, Tavares has tried to paint himself as a stalwart defender of electrification, ready to weather the winds of change even if that proves difficult in the near term. Speaking to the Financial Times at the Paris Auto Show, he warned that slowing the transition to electric vehicles would be “a big trap” and blamed governments for failing to provide adequate incentives to make the switch. Unions on either side of the Atlantic, however, argue that they’re paying the price for Stellantis’s longtime, short-term focus on maximizing profits and executive pay. “Stellantis has underinvested in this,” i.e., the electric transition, says Maurizio Oreggia, international coordinator for the Italian metalworkers’ union FIOM. He agrees that the Italian government and European Union aren’t doing enough to offer public support for electrification, bolstering which is among FIOM’s top demands. But he also sees Stellantis’s own choices as a key reason why the automaker is falling behind. “This transition is necessary given climate change, if you look at the situation of the planet. But we’ve known we have to do this for many years,” he adds. Instead of reinvesting profits into research and development, improving working conditions, or electrification, “they have distributed profits to shareholders, never to the workers.” Earlier this month, Stellantis announced that it had bought $1.1 billion worth of stock back from shareholders since August. Tavares received a 56 percent pay bump last year. Defending his lavish compensation package in April, Tavares said it was simply part of the contract between himself and the company, “just as there are contracts for soccer players and for Formula 1 drivers.” The situation facing autoworkers is especially acute in Italy, where anger at Stellantis is pitched. Stellantis was created in 2021 through the merger of the French auto group Peugeot and Fiat Chrysler Automotives. Fiat has long been Italy’s only mass-market automaker, responsible for the bulk of the roughly 1.5 million cars made there as recently as the early 2000s. This year, Italy is expected to produce fewer than 500,000 cars, half as many as it made in 2018 and 250,000 fewer than it made last year. That decline has been especially hard-felt in the northern city of Turin—the longtime home of “Mamma Fiat”—which has seen four car plants close since 1982. “The trend is downward in all European countries, but in Italy it’s been particularly strong. Various governments never allowed a foreign player to enter the Italian domestic market for car production,” says economist Simone Gasperin. In addition to heavily subsidizing auto plant construction, Italy historically used state-owned enterprises to support its car industry. That included efforts to build out the country’s highway system and offer cheaper gasoline prices via Eni. Through Alfa Romeo, Gasperine explains that the Italian government “was able to inject a dose of competition, which made Fiat more sensitive to things like investing to remain competitive. It was a way to reduce their monopolistic power.” Fiat acquired Alfa Romeo in 1986 amid a wave of privatizations. Since then, successive governments have generally relied on consumer-side subsidies to bolster the auto sector. And whereas the Inflation Reduction Act’s consumer-side E.V. incentives require that cars and their components be made in the U.S. or its trade partners in order to qualify, EU law generally prohibits these kinds of domestic content requirements. Even the comparatively generous state support for automakers to go electric in the United States can’t make up for their decades spent doubling down on internal combustion engines. Companies have reliably resisted regulatory efforts—like more stringent fuel efficiency standards—that might have spurred innovation. “Stellantis was one of the slowest, if not the slowest, to begin their transition to the next generation of vehicles,” says UAW Region 4 Director Brandon Campbell, who joined the demonstration in Paris and the strike rally in Rome; he first came to the union when he started working at the Belvidere plant in 1994. “They’re paying the price for that, but that is driven by their poor management and their poor decisions.” (For the sake of disclosure, my partner works for the UAW.) The EU has moved to end the sale of internal combustion engine–powered vehicles by 2035, a decision now facing fierce pushback from powerful parties within the bloc. While such a policy certainly spurs demand for E.V.s, it’s not at all clear that European companies will be making them. “Europe has already a much more developed E.V. market than the U.S. but is not prepared to produce most of the E.V.s that will be sold here,” Gasperin tells me. As Chinese companies roll out affordable E.V.s at home and abroad, Stellantis and other European automakers have felt pressured to lower prices in order to compete with foreign companies and convince consumers to buy the still relatively limited range of electric models they’re producing. Larger and more expensive cars make for bigger margins, though. In the U.S., where there’s no looming phaseout deadline for gas-powered cars, automakers including Stellantis have seemed content to double down on mostly gas-powered bestsellers like the RAM and Ford F-Series—however limited the demand for those hulking, pricey trucks and SUVs might be elsewhere. “Manufacturers’ only strategy is to preserve their margins,” Sophie Binet, secretary-general of France’s powerful General Confederation of Labour, or CGT, told those gathered outside the Paris Auto Show last week. “Given our salaries, no worker can afford a car that costs 40, 50, 60, or 100,000 euros.” As the factories making those cars close and companies move production abroad, she quipped that “the CGT project is simple: a small economical electric vehicle entirely manufactured in France, which could be sold for around 15,000 euros.” Kate Aronoff is a staff writer at The New Republic.

Title: Ford's SWOT analysis: stock outlook amid EV transition and cost challenges

Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), a global leader in the automotive industry, is navigating a complex landscape of challenges and opportunities as it transitions towards electric vehicles (EVs) and digital services. This comprehensive analysis examines Ford's current position, future prospects, and the factors influencing its stock performance. Ford, trading under the ticker NYSE:F, has a long-standing presence in the global automotive market. The company manufactures and distributes vehicles across six continents, with a product lineup that includes cars, trucks, and utility vehicles under the Ford and Lincoln brands. In recent years, Ford has been intensifying its focus on electric vehicles and connected services, aiming to position itself as a leader in the evolving automotive industry. Ford's financial performance has been a mixed bag in recent quarters. The company's second-quarter earnings for 2024 fell short of elevated expectations, disappointing some stakeholders. Despite this setback, Ford maintained its guidance for the fiscal year 2024, projecting adjusted EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes) in the range of $10 to $12 billion. Analysts are divided on Ford's near-term prospects. Some believe the company may reach the upper end of its guidance range, citing potential strengths in the Pro segment, cost improvements, and reduced losses from the Model e division. Others express concern about the impact of price normalization and the possibility of a slowdown in the latter half of 2024. The company's adjusted earnings per share (EPS) are expected to grow from $2.01 in FY23 to $2.20 in FY25, indicating a positive trajectory despite near-term challenges. Ford's electric vehicle strategy is a critical component of its future growth plans. The company is committed to expanding its EV lineup, leveraging iconic nameplates and its strong position in commercial vehicles. The introduction of Gen-2 EV platforms is anticipated to be a potential game-changer, with analysts suggesting it could transition Ford's EV segment from losses to profits. However, the EV transition is not without challenges. Recent data shows that Ford's EV sales have not demonstrated significant quarter-over-quarter growth, raising questions about the pace of adoption and market demand. The company's "Skunkworks" platform is seen as potentially transformative, but it remains a "show-me story," indicating that its success is yet to be proven. Cost management has been a persistent challenge for Ford. Warranty costs, in particular, have been a significant drag on profitability, highlighting ongoing quality issues that need to be addressed. The company has acknowledged these challenges and is reportedly undergoing a cultural change to improve cost control and operational efficiency. Ford's restructuring efforts, especially in overseas markets, have shown positive results. However, cost structures in the United States remain high, presenting an ongoing area for improvement. Ford faces intense competition in the automotive industry, particularly as the sector shifts towards electrification and digital services. The company's Pro segment, which focuses on commercial vehicles, has shown strength and is expected to benefit from software and service offerings. This segment could be a key differentiator for Ford in the competitive landscape. Investor sentiment has shown a preference for General Motors (NYSE:GM) over Ford, primarily due to differences in capital return profiles. This preference underscores the importance of Ford's efforts to improve its financial performance and shareholder returns. Looking ahead, Ford's future prospects are tied to several key factors. The company's ability to successfully transition to electric vehicles while maintaining profitability in its traditional segments will be crucial. The growing focus on software and services, particularly in connected vehicles, presents an opportunity for Ford to tap into new revenue streams and potentially improve margins. The company's electrification strategy, which leverages iconic nameplates and its strong position in commercial vehicles, could provide a competitive advantage. However, execution risks remain, and the success of Ford's low-cost EV platform will be closely watched by investors and industry observers. Warranty costs have been a significant concern for Ford, negatively impacting its profitability. These costs not only affect the company's bottom line directly but also raise questions about product quality and reliability. If Ford fails to address these issues effectively, it could lead to continued financial strain and potentially damage the brand's reputation. Improving quality control and reducing warranty-related expenses will be crucial for enhancing profitability and maintaining customer trust. Ford's transition to electric vehicles comes with substantial risks. The company is investing heavily in EV technology and production, but market adoption rates remain uncertain. If EV sales growth fails to meet expectations, Ford could face overcapacity issues and lower returns on its investments. Additionally, the competitive landscape in the EV market is intensifying, with both traditional automakers and new entrants vying for market share. Ford must navigate these challenges while also managing the decline of its traditional internal combustion engine business, which still accounts for a significant portion of its revenues and profits. Ford's increasing focus on software and services, particularly in connected vehicles, presents a significant opportunity to boost margins. These digital offerings typically have higher profit margins compared to traditional vehicle sales. By developing a robust ecosystem of software and services, Ford could create new revenue streams that are less cyclical than vehicle sales. This shift could also enhance customer loyalty and provide valuable data insights, allowing Ford to improve its products and services continually. If executed successfully, this strategy could transform Ford's business model and financial profile, potentially leading to higher valuation multiples similar to those seen in tech companies. Ford's Gen-2 EV platform has the potential to significantly improve the company's market position in the electric vehicle segment. This new platform is expected to be more cost-effective and efficient, potentially allowing Ford to offer competitive EVs at lower price points. If successful, it could help Ford capture a larger share of the growing EV market and improve profitability in this segment. The Gen-2 platform could also enable Ford to expand its EV lineup more rapidly, covering a broader range of vehicle types and price points. This flexibility could be crucial in adapting to changing consumer preferences and regulatory requirements, positioning Ford as a strong competitor in the evolving automotive landscape. Strengths: Weaknesses: Opportunities: Threats: This analysis is based on information available up to October 24, 2024, and reflects the complex dynamics shaping Ford's future in a rapidly evolving automotive industry.

Title: Tesla Cybertruck pushes past Ford Mach-E to become third best-selling EV in America | TechCrunch

The only two vehicles that sold better were the Model 3 sedan and Model Y SUV. The polarizing truck notched this achievement despite selling at its most expensive trim model in the early going. It’s also a sign of just how much trouble major automakers like Ford and General Motors have run into in finding customers for their own EVs. Automotive research firm Kelley Blue Book pegged Tesla’s Cybertruck sales as third-best last week, notching over 16,000 sales. Ford only sold around 7,000 F-150 Lightnings in the third quarter, and just over 13,000 Mustang Mach-E SUVs, according to sales data from the automaker. GM has seemingly found some early success with its new Blazer and Equinox EVs, but still only sold around 32,000 electric vehicles total last quarter. Rivian only delivered around 3,800 of its own electric pickup. Tesla confirmed the third-best accomplishment Wednesday when it released its financial results for the third quarter. Tesla also noted that the Cybertruck generated a positive gross margin — a measure of profitability that is calculated by subtracting the cost of goods sold from revenue. Tesla also revealed it generated $25.2 billion in sales during the quarter and notched a $2.2 billion profit. Tesla’s profit was boosted by $739 million in sales of regulatory credits to other automakers — the second-highest amount it’s ever sold in a quarter, behind the second quarter of this year when it sold $890 million worth. Tesla said its profits were also boosted by the fact that it started shipping its Actually Smart Summon feature and its Full Self-Driving (Supervised) software to Cybertruck owners, which allowed the company to recognize some of the money owners paid up front as revenue. Tesla’s relentless cost-cutting also plays into its profit figure. Tesla said in the shareholder letter that the cost of goods sold per vehicle is down to $35,100. Those Q3 figures helped push Tesla’s stock price up more than 9% in after-hours trading. Cost-cutting isn’t helping every part of the business, though. Tesla reported a 20% year-over-year growth in Supercharger stations, its slowest growth figure in years. This comes after Tesla gutted — and then started rehiring some of — its Supercharger team earlier this year as part of a massive company-wide layoff.
