It's not a car it's a ute I’d prefer a get out of jail free card for marrying my cousin than cashback if I was buying this car marry cousins - "Who will come and live a life devoted to chastity, abstinence, and a flavorless mush I call rootmarm?" I had to look up that reference :-( Marrying your cousin is legal in Australia. diversity is our greatest strength But, bizarrely, you can't marry close relatives by adoption that you have no blood relationship with. Kudos for trying That's more of a Toyota Camry thing… Then they have your details & hound the crap out of you till you buy something . whats with all the car sales I think people have very short memories and forget what life was like in the few years leading up just before covid. Esp 2018/19 House prices were falling, cash rate was low for years, QE full throttle yet noting was moving forward, car sales tending lower, food was cheap, rent was cheap. With cars - you could literally go into a dealership, get 10-15% off list price and drive away a day or two later. Stock was everywhere. Did you know every year they had plate clearance where you would get awsome discounts on old models? Also when you bought a car and drove it out of the dealership it actually depreciated rather than appreciated? Unbelievable ah? With houses the list price was what the owner wanted. Buyers told the agent what they wanted to pay for a property, not the other way around where agents are telling buyers what they believe it's worth lol and younger people now days boast that they paid over the listing price. Everyone crying poor that rates are high yet they are still below running average and below what it was 15 years ago. Money printing around the world during 2020-21 changed alot of things. bring on the crash i say That's what I need. Nearly paid off my PPOR - time to look for investment bargain and to build a retirement portfolio in the next 20 years It was only that good prior to 2021 because after 2021 is so crap. The worse thing about the vast borrowing and money printing at the time was the only difference between the two political parties at the time worldwide was how much they gave away. Also “QE full throttle” was always going to bite us in the butt eventually. COVID just brought it forward and amplified the effect. What's QE? @Mr Bob Dobalina: Quantitative Easing. Central banks simply printing more money. @GordonD: Turned out to be central banks buying failing assets at over market prices to stop the economy from failing and injecting more liquidity giving cash to those people who rinse and repeat. Infinite money glitch Byd Shark is way better than this old car. Not that I'm ever buying one, but are they right hand drive conversions or new from factory already right side? Locally converted with Factory Warranty military‑grade aluminium‑alloy body Why don't they use them in civil wars? I always see a machine gun mounted on the back of Toyota's. Because Toyota’s will last longer and are cheaper to buy. Military grade =/= good. Military grade = cheapest tenderer. Maybe but non-military grade = cheapest materials possible. Military grade at least has some standards to meet. Then what does “built to tough Australian standards/conditions” means in literally every Ute advertising now? @ATangk: Built to handle potholes on the M1. @smartazz104: What about parramatta road? Cant expect me to believe these trucks are being used out of the city. Any deals on F-150 Lightning? Released? No plans yet according to fold https://www.ford.com.au/support/how-tos/electric-vehicles/f-… Not seen them for sale but did see one in Perth CBD not long ago, awesome looking cars in-person, so many storage spots. Anyone drive past Footscray road? The port holding yard has hundreds of these gathering dust. Selling a MY23 in MY25 sounds miserable Trying to sounds desperate. Price in title The truck of your dreams blinding you with their lights in your rearview mirror. "Car" It’s a car when compared to the average American. And the hood is just high enough to kill all the children you want! You would have to have rocks in your head to buy a Ford. They do not stand behind their product. Definitely wouldn’t want to stand in front of it, especially if it was moving. Dare say you'd be safe standing at any point around a Ranger. Chances are it's broken down and needs an engine rebuild. 100,170 vehicles sold here in 2024, all those people must be idiots then. Correct. Whoever buys American industrial rubbishes is an idiot. Probably like 5 of those are American-built vehicles. Emotional Support Vehicles. Cheaper to get a psych. What’s the benefit for Ford of this vs a straight old fashion discount ? Probably some creative accounting move Minimise price erosion and average selling price. That way they can keep the RRP at a certain threshold to keep the overall revenue high - looks better on EOFY reports. Because it doesn't piss off all the people who've recently bought one that the value of their vehicle suddenly dropped. getting close to RIP status. A 5% gift card on $140,000 vehicle which must be one of the most un-Ozbargain purchases imaginable. No deal Buyers can finally afford that medical enlargement they so desperately crave. The XLT LWB is only $108k and has a $7k card (~6.5% off). Not too bad. Hahahaha 12 yards long, 2 lanes wide, 65 tons of American pride! Canyonero! Boganero! Errr what is the bargain / deal ? Sweet. Basically first months of petrol for free. The lower the IQ the BIGGER the truck! Sorry but the F-150 pisses all over the smaller Ranger. Why the hate sunshine? Do you want to seem edgy? Is everything OK at home? MY23!!!!!!!! An $8k/5% discount on a MY 23 in 2025 sounds like a bargain What happened to the chip shortage and the war in Ukraine hiking prices and extending delivery times. Gouge supreme. They appear to have moved on the coffee and eggs for the corporate bottom line. we dont need these in our local woolies and the emission out of these cars are disgusting.
