We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. This year was a mixed bag for the large automakers, with sales in the US climbing and prices holding steady for the most part. But changes are coming for the industry — whether on the domestic front with a new administration or the threat of cheaper, foreign competition. S&P Global Mobility projects US sales will hit a seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) of 16.2 million units in 2025, an estimated increase of 1.2% from a projected 16.0 million units in 2024, which S&P says still reflects an uncertain environment for auto sales in the US. "Vehicle pricing levels are expected to decline but remain high; interest rates are expected to shift further downwards, but inflation levels are anticipated to remain sticky, and new vehicle inventory should also progress, but careful management is expected too,” said Chris Hopson, manager of North American light vehicle sales forecasting for S&P Global Mobility, in its 2025 report. With that said, let’s take a look at what to expect from major automakers in the US next year, starting with the big three. Click here for Yahoo Finance's Tesla 2024 year in review and 2025 look ahead. The biggest of the Big Three experienced a strong 2024 with robust sales of its generally higher-priced vehicles, like trucks, SUVs, and EVs. GM (GM) shareholders were rewarded with the stock up 25% for the year, buoyed by GM’s aggressive accelerated share repurchase (ASR) programs, a type of buyback. GM announced a $6 billion ASR in June of this year, following a $10 billion ASR in November of 2023. After a Q3 in which GM said it took market share, the rest of the year was set up for success. GM said its inventory stood at around 627,000 vehicles entering Q4, which is around 50 to 60 days of supply entering a typically busy holiday period, and incentives in Q3 were 4.5% of average transaction price, which the automaker said was 2% below the industry. New EVs are coming in 2025, with the Cadillac Vistiq, Optiq, Escalade IQ, and Chevrolet Bolt EV. This comes after the company refreshed the Chevy Equinox and Traverse, GMC Acadia and Terrain, and Buick Enclave. But GM might have some issues with its EVs if the tax credit goes away under the Trump administration. “If those EV models, specifically for GM, because they made some launches that are doing fairly well in the past three months — if they're not eligible for tax credits next year, it is going to impact their ability to scale and ultimately our growth assumption,” S&P Global autos sector lead Nishit Madlani told Yahoo Finance. Despite a strong year, the company had some late-year surprises, like a $5 billion write-down in China and a wind-down of its Cruise robotaxi business. Investors will be keeping an eye on those two stories as 2025 progresses. GM’s archrival, Ford, is coming off a good sales year too. But all has not been well for the Dearborn, Mich.-based automaker. The company had to scale back its profit outlook for 2024 due to supplier issues and is still losing billions of dollars in its EV business. The company canceled an upcoming three-row EV SUV and pushed back the opening of a new EV plant, opting to focus instead on smaller EVs for the future, such as a compact-style pickup it says is coming next decade. With the cash cow F-150 pickup and Expedition full-size vehicles updated in 2024, Ford’s 2025 will consist of updates to the Mustang and Ford Transit commercial van along with the release of the $300,000 Mustang GTD supercar. The company has seen sales jump for its hybrid offerings like the Maverick pickup, F-150 hybrid PowerBoost models, and Escape CUV, and will continue to shift production toward those units. Wall Street is looking for better execution from Ford as well as cost discipline. “There are indications that the profit story for them is not trending in the direction we had expected a year ago, when we raised them to investment rate,” Madlani said. “They had some warranty costs. They had some supplier stability issues that we haven't seen at other automakers. So that's why there's some questions internally around execution from the management team there as well.” Ford will give a full update on its EV business outlook and profitability in the first half of 2025. The situation isn’t much better at Stellantis, which has Dodge, Ram, Jeep, Chrysler, Fiat, and others in its portfolio. A management shake-up will bring a new CEO in 2025 and a revamped plan for its automobiles and trucks. The delayed EV push for the automaker will see changes as well, with gas-powered cars joining the ranks of EVs, which will share the same platform. This comes after sales slumped for the automaker, with inventory building up and dealers having to slash elevated prices to move vehicles off the lots. “We’re grinding through a transition,” CFO Doug Ostermann said following the release of disappointing Q3 sales. For 2025 the company has promised lower prices for its existing models, like Jeep SUVs, with the addition of engine choices like V6s and V8s for customers who did not want to see those powertrain choices go away. And new models are on the way too. In terms of new product launches, the all-electric Dodge Charger Daytona is coming with a gas-powered version as well, an all-electric Jeep Wagoneer S is on the roster, and the Ram 1500 Ramcharger range-extended hybrid pickup will be pushed forward to 2025, jumping ahead of the all-electric Ram REV EV pickup. It should be noted that the Ram trucks were supposed to arrive in 2024. While S&P’s Madlani notes Stellantis has seen some improvement in terms of inventory management, there are deeper issues to work through, such as its mismanagment of production and demand in the first place. S&P ratings has a negative outlook on Stellantis at the moment. The world’s largest automaker — and the Big Three's biggest competitor — is having a banner year in the US, with year-to-date sales through Q3 up 5.5% and its “electrified vehicle” sales up a whopping 58% year to date. Powering those electrified sales are its Camry hybrids, RAV4 hybrid crossover, and even the new Tacoma that comes in mild hybrid form. And, of course, the Prius — the hybrid king that came to US shores 20 years ago is still setting the pace for hybrid sales. This year, Toyota went all out in the US with an all-new Camry and Tacoma pickup, two of its major volume sellers. It also relaunched the Landcruiser SUV and brought out minor updates to the Corolla, Sienna, and Crown, to name a few. Coming in 2025 is the new 4Runner, a midsize go-anywhere SUV with a devoted following that will be coming with — you guessed it — a hybrid powertrain. Toyota says hybrids are what Americans want, and pickup and SUV offerings like the Tacoma and 4Runner will cater to that demand. One note of caution for Toyota is the coming merger of Honda and Nissan. While the situation won’t likely change much in the near term (with the deal looking to close in 2026), it will allow the two Japanese automakers to match Toyota in size. “There is potential for a merged company to be better prepared to address the competitive threat from the newer players, as well as to be more competitive with Toyota,” S&P Global Mobility analyst Stephanie Brinley said in a note published earlier this month. Germany’s Volkswagen (VWAGY), once the crown jewel of the country’s automotive sector and formerly the world’s No. 1 automaker, had a rough year. The company’s slump in important regions like Europe (with threats of a major labor strike averted for the time being) and China is a major problem, and development difficulties with its in-house software and EV development have led to costly delays. The situation in China, once a top region for the company, isn’t going to get better anytime soon, even with a new joint venture partner coming. However, the US region has actually improved, with sales growing for the Atlas SUV, Tiguan crossover, and even Jetta sedan. Meanwhile, the company’s sole EV offering — the ID.4 — has seen sales cut by half in Q3, and the ID.Buzz van just went on sale, with a costly starting price of about $60,000. Another concern: There are no hybrids on offer at the moment in the US, a big miss considering their popularity. VW says the upcoming all-new Tiguan in 2025 won’t have hybrid power until 2026 at the latest, which is a concern as it is VW’s top seller in the US. The full-size Atlas won’t get hybrid power until 2026, either. VW’s big bet on electrification remains with EVs at the moment, which could be a tough sell. With most of its current models updated or refreshed last year or this fall with the 2025 model year, VW does not at the moment have anything big planned for next year. In fact, VW’s biggest new push in the US is with Scout Motors, its wholly owned startup that will make EV and hybrid versions of SUV and pickup adventure vehicles using Rivian tech. But those vehicles won’t be in showrooms until 2027 at the earliest, which means VW will have to power through with its current portfolio through 2025 and beyond.

Title: The era of big bets on EV plants in Canada is over - it’s time for consolidation, minister says

Industry minister Francois-Philippe Champagne has led the strategy that’s seen some of the biggest investments in the history of Canada’s auto sector.Tara Walton/The Canadian Press The era of Canada putting down big bets on massive new electric-vehicle battery plants is coming to end. As Industry Minister, François-Philippe Champagne has led the strategy that’s seen Stellantis N.V., STLA-N Volkswagen Group and Honda Motor Co. HNDAF commit to new factories in Ontario that represent some of the biggest investments in the history of Canada’s auto sector. A few months ago, Mr. Champagne was still talking up the possibility of landing one or two more such commitments from global automakers. But in a year-end interview with The Globe and Mail, he acknowledged he’s no longer big-game hunting the same way. Instead, the focus has shifted to solidifying the existing commitments during a turbulent period for the nascent EV sector, and leveraging them to grow out the domestic supply chain that they are meant to anchor. “Now, it’s about consolidation,” Mr. Champagne said, referring in particular to landing and advancing investments in mining and refining battery materials such as lithium, graphite and nickel. Repeatedly invoking a new mantra about the need to achieve greater “speed and scale,” he was tacitly acknowledging that Canada needs to dramatically pick up the pace for the battery plants to be supplied primarily by the country’s ample reserves of critical minerals – access to which was one of the main reasons cited by the automakers for placing the investments here. Mr. Champagne also reflected on how Ottawa’s EV-battery strategy has played out to date, defending the government’s billions of dollars in subsidies, in the face of mounting skepticism resulting from setbacks in the auto sector’s transition to EVs, as it has struggled with slower demand growth than expected. While that bumpiness has not derailed the three landmark battery plants in Ontario, it has jeopardized a fourth planned by Sweden’s struggling Northvolt AB, and seen other retreats such as Ford Motor Co. F-N putting off plans to assemble EVs at its facilities in Oakville, Ont. Quebec says Northvolt battery project will go ahead as company cuts 20% of global staff How much longer Mr. Champagne will be the point-person for the strategy is an open question, given that a federal election early in 2025 appears increasingly likely, and the governing party that he serves faces a double-digit deficit in opinion polls. But his perspective may be useful context for whoever is in office by the end of 2025, and tasked with deciding whether and how to double down on trying to turn Canada into a force in EV-making. One of his arguments is that subsidies for the battery plants will not be nearly as high as most people perceive – particularly when it comes to Stellantis and Volkswagen, which most media reports have suggested will top $28-billion in combined support from the federal and Ontario governments. (The Honda deal has a lower ceiling and is structured differently.) That figure is essentially the maximum total possible, contingent on the plants operating at full capacity from the earliest possible date, because it’s mostly derived from production subsidies per battery made that expire in the early 2030s. An arguable upside of the EV demand-growth slowdown, to which Mr. Champagne implicitly pointed, is that the cost for taxpayers will be lower because the factories – expected to be operational for decades – won’t need to ramp up as quickly. “People have this impression that we have dispersed that money,” he said. “But today, I’ve landed tens of billions of investments, and I’ve only dispersed a few hundred million.” He was somewhat more philosophical on the more negative consequences of the industry’s recent struggles, including for Canada’s large industry of parts-makers and other suppliers at the mercy of automakers’ rapidly shifting timelines for EV roll-outs – framing it as inevitable during a revolutionary industrial change. “If you look at the history of the world, when you have a shift in technology for the next century, the first few years are always bumpy,” he said. “My role, and the role of the industry, is not only to look at next week or next month or next year, but to position Canada for long-term success.” He also suggested that in the near-term, Canada is well-positioned to weather uncertainty around the pace of the shift away from internal combustion engines, because Ontario still has several assembly plants making vehicles with those gas-fuelled motors for the foreseeable future, as well as some (notably Stellantis’s Windsor assembly plant) building flexible platforms that can make both types of vehicles. In a possible nod to current political dynamics in the United States – where most Canadian-made vehicles are sold, and where president-elect Donald Trump’s EV skepticism may or may not be counterbalanced by Elon Musk’s role in his administration – Mr. Champagne repeatedly invoked Tesla Inc. as evidence of the need for patience. He did so on the premises that Tesla had plenty of highs and lows before establishing dominance of the early EV space, and that Tesla’s soaring stock price shows that investors retain faith in EVs ultimately taking over the market. Otherwise, he mostly steered away from commenting on the extent to which Mr. Trump’s threat to impose a 25-per-cent tariff on Canadian exports could hurt all forms of vehicle-making here, other than to express optimism that Mr. Trump’s sensitivity to markets – which could react negatively to massive disruptions of the highly integrated Canada-U.S. supply chain – will help dissuade him. Actually strengthening that supply chain in the coming years is partly contingent on the natural-resource question – whether Canada can kick-start its mining sector enough to supply not just domestic facilities but also U.S. ones, as industries seek to reduce reliance on China – which contributes to the government’s focus shifting upstream. Mr. Champagne touted a few examples of progress over the past couple of years – particularly at the mid-stream level, such as plans for Canada’s first copper-foil factory and a joint venture by General Motors Co. and Posco Chemical Co. Ltd. to produce cathode active materials, both in Quebec. He also noted the multifaceted nature of Honda’s investment in Ontario, which includes partnerships with Posco and with Asahi Kasei Corp. to make battery components. That could carry extra weight since Honda’s recently announced plan to merge with Nissan Motor Corp. to create the world’s third-largest automaker, which is widely seen as an effort to keep pace with Chinese competitors. And Honda chief executive Toshihiro Mibe hinted to The Globe earlier this year that his company is interested in further investing in this country’s natural resources. But while the effort to get more critical minerals to market does not rest entirely with whoever sits in his chair in cabinet – and is contingent on factors ranging from the federal Natural Resources ministry’s efforts to work with provinces to speed up permitting, to infrastructure investments, to the Finance Ministry’s implementation of mining tax incentives – it now requires the sort of entrepreneurial hustle Mr. Champagne brought to landing the battery plants. He acknowledged that it might have seemed more obvious to start upstream and then move downstream. The economic case for subsidizing the battery plants always rested partly on the establishment of a reliable market for Canadian resources, so it’s a significant hitch that Canada is not yet fully prepared to supply them. But Mr. Champagne contended that there was a narrow window during which the automakers were deciding where to situate the battery plants – which has now almost closed, with most such North American commitments already made – and he had to seize it. The alternative, he suggested, would have been to effectively give up on Canada’s long history of making cars and trucks, which was a real prospect a few years ago as a decades-long decline threatened to be worsened by being left behind in the EV shift. “One of the first briefings I got from officials was basically that [I would be] presiding over the end of the auto sector in Canada gradually,” he said. “And we turned what was a challenge into an opportunity.” Whether Canada’s efforts to position itself as a major player in the electrification of transportation hold up as a win in the long-run, though, will depend on the success of its next phase working backward to build a supply chain – whoever is steering it.
