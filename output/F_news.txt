Shyam Sankar speaks at the AI Expo For National Competitiveness on May 7, 2024, in Washington, D.C. Tasos Katopodis / Getty Images for Palantir Stay Connected Lauren C. Williams The Defense Department is a sclerotic monopsony whose communist approach to acquisition has the United States on a precipice, writes Palantir’s chief technology officer, who prescribes a “painful” but “necessary” reformation based on competition and software. “I think we're just scratching the surface,” said Shyam Sankar, whose company calls itself the first software prime contractor. “The other huge opportunity is really on using AI to drive efficiencies,” including using technology to supplant human workers and processes that slow innovation and adoption. Sankar recently penned 18 theses that could reform how the Pentagon does business, in explicit comparison to Martin Luther’s criticisms of the Catholic Church. He highlights several well-documented problems often studied by congressionally mandated commissions—such as a belabored budgeting-and-planning process, the perils of requirements, and how cost-plus contracts remove incentives to innovate. The 18-page document also manages to say the quiet part out loud, demanding the Pentagon and Congress to change its practices with colorful curtness. One of Sankar’s main themes is the need for competition—whether it’s companies vying for Pentagon contracts or customers in the Defense Department looking for solutions. He also criticizes a system whose major suppliers sell only to the Pentagon and other militaries. “Chinese primes only earn 30-40% of their revenue from the PLA; the remainder is commercial. Those cheap products your neighbor is buying on Amazon are subsidizing lethality which could be used against our men and women in uniform, much the same way that during the Cold War your purchase of an American car, camera, and cereal subsidized America’s lethality against her enemies,” he wrote. Instead, Sankar writes, the Pentagon should vastly accelerate its purchases from largely commercial companies—like SpaceX, whose CEO Elon Musk has been tapped to lead a Trump administration government-efficiency drive. In September, Palantir’s stock joined the S&P 500, increasing software and tech companies’ share of the index. In recent weeks, Palantir’s market value of $137 billion edged out Lockheed Martin’s. Defense One spoke with Sankar. What are Palantir’s goals for 2025, especially amid a new administration? Our government business has re-accelerated dramatically. We're pretty excited about the product road maps that we've built. [Maven Smart System has] become the [Joint All Domain Command and Control] MVP. It's getting a huge amount of adoption, so we're pretty excited about that, and continue to invest in that. What defense areas will you expand into? I think we're just scratching the surface. So I mean, a big focus, obviously, Maven is at the pointy end of integrating AI into the kill chain. So how do you do that across all the services? It's coming down from OSD right now. The Army has started to adopt it…and the opportunities for that to happen with the [maritime operations centers] with the Navy and with the [air operations centers] with the Air Force, that are definitely top of mind. [We’re] continuing to push into space…we're at the very beginning of that. And then the other huge opportunity is really on using AI to drive efficiencies. There's more civilians in the DOD than there are uniformed service members. There are more acquisition professionals than there are Marines. And so have we just crushed ourselves with process? And I'm sure most of that process is needed, but can we use AI agents instead of humans to drive efficiency and speed through that? We've been able to automate the foreign-disclosure process, where it used to take humans three days to collect intelligence and then rewrite it to be releasable to partners, taking that down to three minutes. So the obvious benefit there is lethality and being able to share with allies and partners. But I think the other part of it is it just makes for a much leaner force. If you look at [Georgetown University’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology] report on Maven. With Maven, you can perform targeting operations with 20 people that used to take us 2,000 people in Iraq. So that sort of efficiency really drives the ability to hide in a pure conflict. You're much smaller, [there’s a] much smaller footprint, less support infrastructure, and [that] drives lethality. Would shrinking the Pentagon workforce, particularly on the civilian side, actually drive efficiency? It does in the U.S. commercial market every single day. We automated [an] insurance underwriting process where one of America's largest insurers, with 78 AI agents, took a process that used to take three weeks down to hours. We have this challenge in government, generally—it's not just the Department of Defense—where we view people as abundant, and technology is unaffordable and expensive. But that's the exact opposite of how the commercial world looks at technology. They view people as very expensive, and technology as cheap as the way of achieving efficiency and effectiveness. I think a lot of that is because of the monopsony. That's what really speaks to the heart of the “Defense Reformation.” Like, why do we have the system we have? Well, I don't envy the position of being the department; being the sole buyer for a thing is very hard. At some very fundamental level, you believe in free markets or you don't. And what we have is a centrally, unplanned process. So it's like the worst of communism, really: a central planning process is not actually planned. We have a [Future Years Defense Program] that takes five years, two years to do [program objection memorandum]—you can't really change your mind anywhere along there. You're gonna have unitary efforts: we have one F-35 for three services. I'm not sure we should have 30 years on $2 trillion. When we were building submarine-launched ballistic missiles under [Vice Adm. William] Raborn in the [1960s], we had four competing programs running concurrently. Today, we look at that and we say, ‘Oh, isn't that wasteful?’ But actually, CBO zone analysis shows that it was cheaper and faster because we had competition. And we've gotten too fixated, since the end of the Cold War, on how much competition is there in the industrial base. That's not actually the problem. The problem is there's not enough competition inside of government. Will Congress go along? Absolutely. I mean, I don't want to be too Pollyannaish about it, but I think Congress recognizes it’s part of the problem. I think what makes it really hard is they do have an actual oversight function to perform. So how do you balance the need for oversight with the necessary maneuver room that you're going to need when you're doing something innovative? That's just reality. If I think about all the projects in the company that I'm overseeing, I have to give folks the room to pivot, to change, to move. I think some of the recommendations coming out of the PPBE Commission are exactly right, like a capability element approach. Rather than a program-element approach, we're going to resource counter-UAS as a category and you're going to have the freedom and flexibility to move and adapt within that. If making a change, if changing your mind, if reacting to new data is major brain damage and requires things to go up and down the building up and down the Capitol Hill, you're not going to make changes, which means you're just going to accumulate error. Because the only thing you know for sure is that whatever plan you came up with yesterday is wrong today. The question is: can you fix it every single day as you observe that error, or can you just let all that error accumulate? And our five-year FYDP, our two-year POM—how we oversee these things is not fit for the moment. What do you most want the Pentagon and Congress to hear? The first one is that monopsony is the problem. You can look at your industrial base as a monopsonist. You get the industrial base you deserve. It really is all your fault. So you have to change your behaviors, what you're incentivizing and how you're organizing yourself to get what you need. Stop blaming the prime, stop thinking like some process is going to fix this. We need to approximate market forces as much as possible. “We need more competition inside of government” would be the pithy way of saying it. The second one is that cost-plus makes us dumber, poorer, and slower. The only two industries that do cost-plus are general contractors on remodels and the government. I don't know if you've done a remodel before, but are you happy with how that went and the price predictability and the timelines and stuff? It's just not the way to do these things. You've already lost by thinking about requirements to begin with. Share the problems with a competitive American market and let them come to you with solutions and then buy the best ones you like. Buy multiple if you want, but you're going to have to rely on the American industrial base, not the defense industrial base to provide compounding price performance. And you see that with the SpaceX example. It used to cost $50,000 per kilogram to get to orbit with the shuttle program. With Starship Heavy reuse, it's $10 to $20 per kilogram—not missing any zeros there. You can't get that with cost-plus, you can only get that because Elon [Musk] cares about getting to Mars. But ​​the DoD is kind of a unique customer. It has specific needs, like lethality and security. But that's really a response from our present world. Before the fall of the Berlin Wall, only 6 percent of [Pentagon spending on major weapons] went to defense primes. The rest went to dual-purpose companies. Chrysler built cars and missiles. Ford built satellites. Until 1990, General Mills, the cereal company, built torpedoes and artillery. So we had a very different American economy, where people were invested not only in economic prosperity, but also in freedom. And this is important, because commercial innovation drives price-performance improvements. You just can't see anywhere else. If you work at a car company in America and you're not able to decrease price for 4% a year, you're gonna get fired, you know. iIn the industrial base and the defense industrial base, if prices aren't increasing all the time, people would be shocked. So, like, the fundamental mechanisms are missing. And I think the reason we have what we have is that when we lost competition; when the Berlin Wall fell down, we didn't have a pure competitor anymore. The Soviets were basically done, and we went from 6 percent spending on unique defense primes to 86 percent today. It's not that I'm saying the products are dual-use, like missiles are single-use, but the companies are dual-purpose. I built the Operation Warp Speed supply chain for the U.S. government in two weeks because two years earlier, I had solved a structurally similar problem for BP and oil and gas production. Anything else? The most important thing is: “How did we get here?” We are in this state of undeclared emergency. We've lost deterrence as the West in the world, we've spent trillions of dollars. And how did we get here? My argument to you is really this: we went from spending 94% of our money on dual-purpose companies to creating a unique class of defense specialists that we put on the Galapagos Islands, and we created a great schism between commercial innovation and defense. And that has made our country much less safe, much less innovative. It's created many of these problems, and we did that because of the nature of monopsony. And the answer is to fix that. That's where it starts. NEXT STORY: Army aims to move its pay system to the cloud by 2027 Help us tailor content specifically for you:

Title: These 5 ‘Special’ Dividends Are More Than One-Hit Wonders
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2024/12/02/these-5-special-dividends-are-more-than-one-hit-wonders/

Piggy bank with business stuff, business and finance concept, vintage color tone. Today we’ll discuss a 5.4% dividend that actually annualizes to 7%. A 5.7% payer that really dishes 12.4%. And even a headline 15% yield that is understated because the company handed out 16.1% last year. Wait. What? These “typos” fool the mainstream financial websites. We are discussing special dividends today. Payouts that are awarded as a bonus to regular quarterly dividends. Only a select few firms dish specials. Sometimes, it’s thanks to a sudden influx of money. Let’s take billboard and transit display giant Outfront Media (OUT) which sold its Canadian business for C$410 million in cash in June. Fast forward to November, and Outfront announced a massive 75-cent special dividend on top of its 30-cent quarterly dividend, vaulting its 12-month yield from a healthy 6.3% to a mouth-watering 10.2%. This, of course, was a one-off special—not one that we are looking to bank on annually. We want “the other” type of special payer. The company that says it’s a one-off, but makes the payment every single year. These tend to fall into one of two camps: These are the stocks that can pay us more specials in the future. Their current yields are often understated today, because specials don’t count in the annual yield calculations. Today we’ll review five generous special payers. Mainstream financial websites list their yields between 5.4 and 15.0%. But they actually paid 7.0% to 16.1% over the past year. Let’s see if history is on pace to repeat or, at least, rhyme. Ford (F) Listed Dividend Yield: 5.4% Dividend Yield With Specials: 7.0% Ford (F) hardly needs an introduction—it’s an American automotive pioneer, and its F-Series has held the title of world’s best-selling truck for nearly a half-century. But Ford doesn’t necessarily have the world’s happiest shareholders. On a pure share-price basis, Ford—across a number of ups and downs—is effectively flat since 1994. That’s zero price returns—if anyone has held for two decades, their only gains as of right now have come from the dividend. That dividend, however, is mighty interesting. Ford temporarily suspended its dividend in 2020 as COVID reared its ugly head, then brought it back at 10 cents per share for a few quarters before returning it to the pre-pandemic 15-cent level. However, instead of just raising its regular past 15 cents, Ford has spent the past two Februarys announcing special dividends—first 63 cents in 2023, then a more modest 18 cents in 2024. That’s part of a stated plan to distribute 40%-50% of free cash flow every year—and if the regular doesn’t do the job, shareholders will get a supplemental payout. (Ford’s FCF in 2023 was $6.8 billion; it’s guiding for $7.5 billion to $8.5 billion this year, so we could assume a decently higher special in 2025 compared to 2024.) But we need more than a nice dividend. And on that front, it’s tough to be overly positive. Ford’s earnings are expected to decline by about 10% this year before leveling out in 2025. The company’s traditional, hybrid and fleet vehicles are generally doing well, though its electric-vehicle arm continues to struggle and deliver thick (albeit shrinking) losses. Meanwhile, while Ford should reach its expected $2 billion in cost cuts this year, warranty costs and inflation are still holding the automaker back. But F shares are cheap, at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) of around 6.5, and a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) of 0.65. (A stock with a PEG below 1.0 is considered undervalued.) Equinor (EQNR) Listed Dividend Yield: 5.7% Dividend Yield With Specials: 12.4% Equinor (EQNR) is little-known to most American investors, though it will occasionally pop up on the radar of anyone seeking out great yields in the energy patch. This Norwegian energy firm is actually two-thirds state-owned, has operations in roughly 30 countries (though most of its production comes from the Norwegian Continental Shelf), and produces roughly 2.1 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) per day. While it’s heavy in traditional oil and gas operations, Equinor has increasingly delved into renewables and low-carbon solutions, and has pledged to become a net-zero energy company by 2050. It owns a nearly 10% stake in Danish wind firm Orsted, and generated 677 gigawatt hours (GWh) of renewable power in its most recent quarter. Indeed, its focus on green energy—largely a product of Norway’s more ambitious energy targets—has hamstrung the firm compared to energy majors such as Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX), which are still doggedly investing in traditional energy extraction. Equinor also has one of the most potent special dividends. Indeed, Equinor has paid out “ordinary” and “extraordinary” dividends over the past few years. Its past three specials have been equal to the 35-cent regular distribution, with the fourth coming out to 60 cents per share. All told, those extraordinary dividends have added a whopping 6.7 points to EQNR’s yield. That’s on top of what has been an uber-generous buyback program. But this is where diving into company reports comes in handy. Seeing as how Equinor isn’t exactly a first-to-mind energy stock to most Americans, there hasn’t been much (some, but not much) reporting on that extraordinary dividend floating away. But indeed, a bullet point in the company’s 2023 full-year report noted: “Expect to conclude extraordinary cash dividend after 2024.” The ordinary dividend will not only stay, but EQNR has pledged to grow it by 2 cents per share annually. That should result in a still-nice yield in this Norwegian energy major—but nothing approaching the wild 12.4% its most recent specials have produced. Business development companies (BDCs)—effectively private equity for us regular Joes—are extremely over-represented among companies offering regular-and-supplemental payouts. Among them are: Sixth Street Specialty Lending (TSLX) Listed Dividend Yield: 8.9% Dividend Yield With Specials: 10.0% I’m on record as saying Sixth Street Specialty Lending (TSLX) has “sterling dividend stewardship,” and that’s still the case today. Sixth Street is a flexible provider of funding to middle-market companies, dealing in senior secured loans, mezzanine debt, non-control structured equity and common equity. A quick look at its ideal investment prospects: Its portfolio currently sits at 115 companies spread across 15 “sector franchises,” such as sports/media/entertainment/telecom, credit market strategies, asset-based finance, and real estate. It boasts exciting names like gen-AI provider Sprinklr and parking compliance platform Passport, but also challenged retailers such as J.C. Penney and Bed Bath & Beyond. TSLX has largely been a well-managed BDC, though last quarter, it added a non-accrual (Lithium Technologies) to bring its total to three, representing roughly 2% of investments at fair value. That’s still a low level, however—Sixth Street still has a great track record of delivering high RoE and making intelligent deals. It also has a smart distribution system in which TSLX pays a core dividend, then distributes 50% of net investment income (NII) in excess of that core dividend as supplemental payouts, keeping the BDC from overextending itself. Over the past 12 months, specials have accounted for about 1.1 extra percentage points’ worth of yield. But we pretty much have to overpay to buy shares. TSLX stock routinely trades at a massive premium to net asset value (NAV), and that’s still the case today—its 22% premium puts it among the five most expensive BDCs right now. BlackRock TCP Capital Corp. (TCPC) Listed Dividend Yield: 15.0% Dividend Yield With Specials: 16.1% BlackRock TCP Capital Corp. (TCPC) is another BDC, this one externally managed, that invests in the debt of middle-market companies with enterprise values of between $100 million and $1.5 billion. TCPC currently has 156 companies in its portfolio, spread across a few dozen industries. But it does have a few heavier concentrations—internet software and services (~14%), software (~14%) and diversified financial services (~13%) earn double-digit weights. Earlier this year, TCPC merged with BlackRock Capital Investment Corp., which I previously mentioned came with a tangible benefit: a 25-basis-point reduction in base management fees, to 1.25%, bringing it a little lower than the industry midpoint. But I was also curious to see whether BlackRock TCP Capital would still keep its special dividends. Yes, I know—what does it matter if TCPC is already doling out a massive 15%? Well, it means that TCPC isn’t necessarily overpromising on its regular dividend. That said, the most recent dividend announcement marked a fifth consecutive regular payout of 34 cents per share, keeping it a penny shy of its pre-COVID levels and raising a little concern that TCPC’s dividend might be plateauing, at least in the short-term. The flip side? We can buy TCPC at a decent discount of 10% to NAV. However, portfolio quality isn’t as ideal as it is with TSLX. Non-accruals are close to 4% at fair value, and watchlist investments increased from 2.6% to 3%. Higher debt costs are weighing on operational performance, too. Carlyle Secured Lending (CGBD) Listed Dividend Yield: 9.5% Dividend Yield With Specials: 11.1% Carlyle Secured Lending (CGBD) is another externally managed BDC, and that manager is a subsidiary of multinational asset manager Carlyle Group (CG). CGBD invests primarily in U.S. middle market companies with between $25 million and $100 million in annual EBITDA. Its investments lean heavily toward first-lien debt (68%), though it also works through second-lien debt and equity, and it also holds investment funds. Its 128 portfolio companies cover a couple dozen industries, including healthcare/pharmaceuticals, software, aerospace/defense and leisure products/services. CGBD came public in 2017, but it has spent its short publicly traded life putting up extremely respectable returns, including mammoth outperformance coming out of the pandemic lows. Better still? Investors have been treated to both a growing base dividend (including an 8% raise in 2024), as well as regular supplemental payouts that have boosted yield by 1.6 percentage points over the past year. CGBD is building a stellar track record, but a few pockmarks are emerging. Lower short-term rates are putting downward pressure on its portfolio yield (it declined 70 bps last quarter), NAV per share and net investment income also declined in Q3, and repayments continue to run ahead of originations. Shares are even a little overheated, at a slight premium to NAV. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.
