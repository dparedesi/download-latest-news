We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks dipped Wednesday as investors digested fresh data that showed inflation made little progress toward the Fed's 2% target in October. After clinching record highs on Tuesday, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell about 0.4%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was off about 0.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was down roughly 0.6%. The mood is muted in the wind-down to the Thanksgiving holiday, which will see markets shut on Thursday and close early on Friday. But the Fed is taking the fore again after being eclipsed somewhat by the debate over the impact of President-elect Donald Trump's tariff plans and Cabinet choices. The latest reading of the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge showed price increases were flat in October from the prior month, raising questions over whether progress in getting to the central bank's 2% goal has stalled. The core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which strips out food and energy costs and is closely watched by the central bank, rose 0.3% from the prior month during October, in line with Wall Street's expectations for 0.3% and the reading from September. Over the prior year, core prices rose 2.8%, in line with Wall Street's expectations but above the 2.7% seen in September. Traders currently see a roughly 34% chance the Fed holds rates steady at that meeting, up from about 24% a month before, per the CME FedWatch Tool. Also out Wednesday, the second estimate of third quarter GDP was unchanged, showing the US economy grew at an annualized rate of 2.8% in the period. Meanwhile, weekly jobless claims continued to move lower with 213,000 unemployment claims filed in the week ending Nov. 23, down from 215,000 the week prior. Trump on Tuesday tapped Jamieson Greer — a veteran of his first term — as US trade representative. Given Greer was heavily involved in Trump's original China tariffs, Wall Street is assessing what his role could mean for the big new tariffs promised for the top US trading partners. On the corporate front, Dell (DELL) shares sank over 12% after quarterly revenue fell short amid flagging PC demand. Peer HP's (HPQ) stock also fell post-earnings, also down more than 11%. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy While a holiday-shortened market day on Friday still separates investors from a fresh month of trading, December is nearly here. And Carson group chief markets strategist Ryan Detrick reminds us that in markets, strength often begets strength. Dating back to 1985, when the S&P 500 rallied more than 20% entering December, the benchmark index has risen further 9 of 10 times. In more recent history, since 2000, the index has risen in every December after the strong rally to start the year. The rally in the world's largest cryptocurrency returned on Wednesday afternoon. After surging near $100,000 last week, bitcoin (BTC-USD) had been quieter this week. But late Wednesday, bitcoin quickly moved higher from a low of $91,804 to a high of $97,357. While traditional markets will be closed for the Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday, bitcoin's $100,000 watch will roll on. Mortgage rates edged lower as financial markets reacted to President-elect Donald Trump’s slate of Cabinet picks. Yahoo Finance's Claire Boston reports: The average 30-year mortgage rate dropped slightly to 6.81% in the week from 6.84% a week earlier. Interest rates have been hovering in the 6.8% area for four weeks straight. The 15-year mortgage rate rose to 6.1%, compared with 6.02% a week prior. “Rates have been relatively flat over the last few weeks as the market waits for more clarity on specific economic policies,” Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist, said in a statement. Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Hamza Shaban reports: President-elect Donald Trump has been quick to promise new tariffs on imports from China, Mexico, and Canada. But his threats, if carried out, potentially threaten to upset inflation and investment and disrupt the broader economic cycle. New duties on imports could reverse some of the hard-won progress on inflation that the Federal Reserve is still struggling to maintain. Meanwhile, making it more expensive to import goods from the nation's neighbors to the north and south may also widen the trade deficit, weighing on investments elsewhere. Read more here. Recent inflation prints have shown little progress toward the Federal Reserve's 2% target. The latest reading of the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, the "core" Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which strips out food and energy costs and is closely watched by the central bank, showed prices rose 0.3% from the prior month during October, in line with the reading from the September. Over the prior year, core prices rose 2.8%, above the 2.7% seen the year prior. And as our chart below shows, the short-term trend hasn't painted a better picture either. Over the past three months, core PCE has risen at annualized rate of 2.8%, well above the Fed's 2% goal. While key inflation readings from the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) for November loom before the Fed meets again in mid-December, the current inflation data has some economists questioning if the central bank will pause interest rate cuts soon. "Core PCE has been going sideways for the last couple of months," Paul Gruenwald, S&P Global Ratings global chief economist, told Yahoo Finance. "If you think the Fed is on a declining rate path, which we do, that's probably leaning toward the pause [cutting interest rates] camp." Gruenwald added that the Fed won't be in a hurry to cut rates unless it sees a "more convincing decline" in core PCE. Nvidia (NVDA) stock slipped more than 3% on Wednesday, weighing on the Nasdaq 100 (^NDX). Shares in the AI chip giant are off about 9% in the past five days as investors have digested the company's latest quarterly earnings release. Other tech stocks were lower on Wednesday, including Dell (DELL). The company's stock fell more than 10% following its quarterly earnings release. In a call with analysts, Dell COO Jeffrey Clarke said AI spending "will not be linear." Fewer Americans are filing for unemployment benefits. But that doesn't mean companies are hiring. New data released by the Department of Labor on Wednesday showed that jobless claims hit a seven-month low in the week ending Nov. 23, with 213,000 initial claims filed. That's down from the 215,000 the week prior and below the 215,000 economists had expected. "We are in a 'low-hire, low-fire' environment," Bank of America's lead economist Aditya Bhave said in a note on Tuesday. "In the spring of 2022, there were two open jobs for every unemployed person. Now that figure is just a little more than one. In other words, there aren’t as many opportunities out there." Recent data has supported that trend, confirming a gradual slowdown of the labor market. Job openings for the month of September fell to their lowest level since January 2021 while the quits rate, a sign of confidence among workers, also dropped to 1.9% from a revised 2% in August. In one bright spot, layoffs have remained low with the unemployment rate still hovering at a healthy 4.1%. "A spike in layoffs would create a negative feedback loop between consumption and the labor market," Bank of America's Bhave said. "For now though, the layoff rate is below pre-pandemic levels, consistent with the low level of unemployment insurance claims." "So while the labor market has moderated," Bhave said, "It hasn’t rolled over!" Read more here. Dell Technologies (DELL) shares dropped more than 13% early Wednesday after the company took a cautious approach to its forecast for investors while warning that AI growth "will not be linear." "AI is a robust opportunity … and interest in our portfolio is an all-time high with no signs of slowing down," Dell COO Jeffrey Clarke said during a call with investors Tuesday night following the company's earnings report for the October period. "That said, this business will not be linear, especially as customers navigate an underlying silicon road map that is changing." Dell's AI server revenues fell 9% in the third quarter from the prior period. That nonlinear growth, coupled with a slower-than-expected recovery in the PC market, led the company to drop the midpoint of its guidance range for annual revenue to $96.1 billion from $97 billion since last quarter. Still, Dell executives and analysts pointed to pent-up demand for Dell's AI servers using Nvidia's (NVDA) latest Blackwell AI chips. Read more about Dell's most recent earnings results and its role in the AI market here. The latest reading of the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge showed price increases were flat in October from the prior month, raising questions over whether progress in getting to the central bank's 2% goal has stalled. The core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which strips out food and energy costs and is closely watched by the central bank, rose 0.3% from the prior month during October, in line with Wall Street's expectations for 0.3% and the reading from September. Over the prior year, core prices rose 2.8%, in line with Wall Street's expectations and above the 2.7% seen in September. On a yearly basis, overall PCE increased 2.3%, a pickup from the 2.1% seen in September. Read more here. Another Wall Street strategist sees a solid backdrop for the US economy and a broadening corporate earnings picture driving stocks higher in the year ahead. JPMorgan's global equity strategy team led by Dubravko Lakos-Bujas sees the S&P 500 (^GSPC) hitting 6,500 by the end of 2025, joining the likes of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, who issued the same target. The target represents about an 8% increase from current levels. Lakos-Bujas wrote that continued "US exceptionalism," continued earnings growth, and interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve will be a tailwind for stocks in the year ahead. He argued the US is likely to remain the "global growth engine with the business cycle in expansion, healthy labor market, broadening of AI-related capital spending, and prospect of robust capital market and deal activity." He added, "heightened geopolitical uncertainty and the evolving policy agenda are introducing unusual complexity to the outlook, but opportunities are likely to outweigh risks. The benefit of deregulation and a more business-friendly environment are likely underestimated along with potential for unlocking productivity gains and capital deployment." US stocks paused near record highs on Wednesday as investors waited for a reading on the Federal Reserve's favorite inflation gauge to provide clues to the path of interest rates. After clinching record highs on Tuesday, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell about 0.2% at the open while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was down about 0.3%. The October print of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, is due for release on Wednesday morning at 10 a.m. ET. The focus is on whether inflation has stalled. Economists expect annual "core" PCE — which excludes food and energy — to have clocked in at 2.8% in October, up from the 2.7% seen in September. Weekly jobless claims rose less than expected last week, and hit a seven-month low, as the impact of labor strikes and severe weather continued to abate. New data from the Department of Labor showed 213,000 initial jobless claims were filed in the week ending Nov. 23, down from the 215,000 the week prior and below the 215,000 economists had expected. Meanwhile, the number of continuing applications for unemployment benefits hit 1.9 million, up 9,000 from the week prior and the highest level since November 2021. Elsewhere in economic data, the second estimate of third quarter GDP came in unchanged, once again showing the US economy grew at annualized rate of 2.8%. Economic data: Personal income & spending (October); MBA mortgage applications (Nov. 22); GDP annualized (third quarter second estimate); Wholesale inventories (October); Initial jobless claims, (week ending Nov. 23); Pending home sales Earnings: No notable earnings releases.

Enrique Lores "Some of that [cost of potential tariffs] will have to go to consumers given what is the overall margin that we have in the categories. But again, we need to wait and see what the final tariffs are for us to define what the exact plan is going to be." Fran Horowitz "When we understand truly what's happening, we will have to make some adjustments, and we will adjust accordingly,It's exactly what we did in 2018 when we had the same challenge. In 2024 we will not be receiving more than 5% or 6% of our US receipts from China. We're taking a look at it country by country, but the agility that we've built into our supply chain is really what's going to help us manage through this." Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: There is no such thing as an all-America car. That’s why tariff will raise car prices. | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: President-elect Donald Trump is vowing to protect American-made cars through steep tariffs on imports. The problem is, there is no such thing as an all-American car. Trump has promised that tariffs, which are a tax on goods that are imported from another country, will be a key part of his economic plan in his second term. On Monday he announced plans to impose a 25% tariff on all goods coming from Mexico or Canada on his first day in office. The US government tracks what percentage of each car’s parts is made “domestically.” But under current trade law, both Canadian-made parts and US-made parts are counted as the same domestic content. Even with the broader definition of “American made,” none exceed 75%. That’s why auto prices could rise sharply if Trump goes ahead with plans to impose steep tariffs on the parts that go into the “American” vehicles found in showrooms nationwide. The auto industry supply chain depends on parts and materials from around the globe – from relatively inexpensive nuts and bolts that are cheaper to buy from foreign producers, to expensive computer chips and other electronic components that aren’t made in sufficient quantities in US factories to meet demand. But despite his claim that tariffs are paid by the foreign country, they are in fact paid by whoever is buying the imported good, and US businesses almost always pass most – or all – of that cost onto consumers. The North American car industry has operated for decades as if the continent is one giant country, thanks to free trade agreements signed by presidents from Bill Clinton to Trump himself. Parts and whole vehicles have flowed freely across borders, sometimes multiple times, before they end up in an American dealership. But Trump is promising to change that. Because of the threat of tariffs on both Canadian and Mexican exports to the United States, shares of most automakers’ stocks fell Tuesday, with GM closing down 9%, Ford down 3%, Stellantis, the maker of cars under the Jeep, Ram, Dodge and Chrysler brands, off 6%. In addition Toyota closed off 2% in US trading, and Honda fell 3%. Trump’s plans would upend the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, the three-country trade deal he negotiated. Mexico and Canada are two of America’s largest trading partners, and are currently exempt from most tariffs under the USMCA, but that that could change. And it’s not just tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada that are raising concern. Trump’s promise to increase tariffs are China an additional 10% beyond existing measures have the potential to make plenty of cars more expensive, too. While China ships relatively few cars to the United States, it is a major source of low-priced auto parts. Trump argues that the move would bring jobs back to the United States by forcing manufacturers to close plants in other countries and open or expand US plants. But the amount of parts that go into cars assembled here would be difficult for American suppliers to replace, which would make building a car at US auto plants much more expensive. There are only two vehicles hit that are considered to be 75% American-made by the US government – the Tesla Model 3, and the Honda Ridgeline, a pickup assembled at a Honda plant in Lincoln, Alabama. And once again, that 75% includes any content that currently comes from Canada, and could be subject to new tariffs. Almost all of the vehicles that have 50% or more of their content from US or Canadian suppliers are either built by Tesla or brands that are ostensibly “foreign,” but actually assemble cars here – Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Nissan, Mazda, Subaru and Toyota. The Ford F-150, the most popular vehicle in the United States for more than 40 years, has the most domestic content of any vehicle made by one of the traditional “Big Three” automakers. While the all the parts are assembled into a pickup truck in either Michigan or Missouri, only 45% of those parts come from US or Canadian factories. Many of the larger versions of its engines come from Mexico. “Yes, it’s America’s truck, assembled in America, but not with American parts,” Ivan Drury, director of insights for Edmunds, told CNN. Finding domestic supplies for many of the imported car parts would be difficult. Even if some are made here, there is not enough excess capacity to replace production of the parts now being imported. And for some of the less expensive goods, it’s not economical to make them at US factories, paying US wages. It would be more economical to pay the tariffs, and pass along the cost to car buyers. Even if an American parts supply could be found, in most cases it would be more expensive. The low price of imports is the reason automakers turned to those supplies in the first place. And spending the time and money to build new plants, assuming suppliers are willing and able to do so, would pose its own challenges. Take the multitudes of computer chips that go into modern cars, for example, which control everything from fuel economy to windshield wipers to lumbar support and seat warmers. The 2022 CHIPS Act approved $30 billion to support building 16 semiconductor factories in the United States. But even with all of that money, it can take three to five years to build new plants. Related article What could get more expensive if Trump launches a new trade war with Mexico and Canada Even modernizing and expanding existing US chip plants, which would need to take place in order to meet increased domestic demand if imported chips become more expensive due to tariffs, could take a year or more. One New York plant that’s being expanded is expected to take 10 years to fully realize its additional production levels. The tariffs would raise the cost of assembling vehicles at US plants. And those increased costs would definitely hit car buyers who are already spending nearly $50,000 on each new vehicle purchased here. “Those costs … are not going to be absorbed by the automakers or suppliers,” Jeff Schuster, global vice president of automotive research at consultant GlobalData, told CNN. Automakers had no comment when asked about their plans and the impact on prices due to new tariffs when contacted by CNN. Even if Trump pulls back on tariff plans and only imposes tariffs on fully-assembled cars imported into the United States, it will raise the price of cars built here, let alone on those imports. During the campaign he vowed 100% to 200% tariffs on vehicles built in Mexico, saying it was vital to protect American auto jobs, although he made no reference to those plans in Monday’s announcement. That would double or triple the cost of those cars, likely killing all demand for them. He predicted there would be a “bloodbath” in the US auto industry and auto jobs if his tariff plans weren’t imposed. Related article Trump ups the ante on tariffs, vowing massive taxes on goods from Mexico, Canada and China on Day 1 If tariffs do in fact raise the price of Mexican-assembled vehicles, like the Chevrolet Blazer or Honda HR-V, and subsequently price them out of the the market, automakers might decide to stop offering them altogether rather than build them at US factories. Cars built in Mexico are most often lower priced, lower profit models, that are only able to maintain their profitability by being built with cheaper Mexican labor. But it’s not just smaller, entry-level models that are built in Mexico that could see price hikes. The tariffs could impact many models car buyers don’t realize are imports, such as the heavy duty versions of Ram pickup trucks, which are built in a Stellantis plant in Saltillo, Mexico. Some versions of the Chevrolet Silverado are also built in Mexico. Even if the automakers shift production of those more profitable vehicles back from Mexico to US factories, it would take years to accomplish the switch. Tariffs on imported vehicles likely would also lead to higher prices on cars that are assembled here, since it would limit the supply of vehicles in the US market. When supply is limited and demand remains strong, rapid price increases are often the result, which is what happened in 2021 and early 2022 when a shortage of computer chips and other parts severely restricted production across the industry. Almost all car buyers were suddenly paying above sticker price for the first time, and average prices soared. And the higher prices on imports would mean less competition for manufacturers making cars and trucks at US plants, giving them the chance to charge more in order to increase profits - not necessarily hire more workers. US automakers have used strong profits in recent years to repurchase billions of dollars worth of their shares to support their stock price, even as they were laying off workers and slowing or trimming production in some cases. “It will have a ripple effect throughout the market, and fallout on all vehicles,” said Drury. “You’re going to disrupt the used car market as well.” The exact impact will be difficult to determine until final details of Trump’s tariff plans are spelled out. During his first term there were numerous threats of tariffs that never came to pass. Drury said that some of the tariff talk from the campaign trail might not happen this time either. If they do, it will have a huge impact on car buyers. “There are all these potential car buyers who have held out because of high prices,” said Drury. “If these tariffs are put in place, it could tank the industry. I hope for the car buying public, nothing is as aggressive as advertised.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Title: Stock market today: S&P 500 retreats from record as US futures slip ahead of key inflation data

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks paused near record highs on Wednesday as investors waited for a reading on the Federal Reserve's favorite inflation gauge to provide clues to the path of interest rates. S&P 500 futures (ES=F) and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) were little changed, coming off fresh all-time highs for the indexes. Contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) fell 0.3%. The mood is muted in the wind-down to the Thanksgiving holiday, which will see markets shut on Thursday and close early on Friday. But the Fed is taking the fore again after being eclipsed somewhat by debate over the impact of Donald Trump's tariff plans and cabinet choices. The October print of its preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, is due for release on Wednesday morning. Focus is on whether inflation has stalled, as some officials believe, and minutes from the Fed's last meeting suggested a cautious stance on interest-rate cuts. Economists expect annual "core" PCE — which excludes food and energy — to have clocked in at 2.8% in October, up from the 2.7% seen in September. A print matching those expectations will likely weigh on bets for a rate cut in December. Traders currently see a roughly 34% chance the Fed holds rates steady at that meeting, up from a roughly 24% a month before, per the CME FedWatch Tool. Updates on third-quarter GDP, durable goods data, and initial jobless claims are also on the economic docket. Questions about whether Trump's agenda will heat up price pressures are also in play for the Fed, some analysts believe, though policymakers aren't able to speak openly on the debate. Trump on Tuesday tapped Jamieson Greer — a veteran of his first term — as US trade representative. Given Greer was heavily involved in Trump's original China tariffs, Wall Street is assessing what his role could mean for the big new tariffs promised for the US's top trading partners.

Griffin's Citadel hedge fund made some big moves in the artificial intelligence (AI) arena during the September-ended quarter. Pharmaceutical stocks make great additions to any portfolio in any market environment. A good one promises steady revenue growth thanks to the fact that patients need their medicines -- so will continue with them no matter what the economy is doing. A top pharma stock also may have one particular star product that brings in blockbuster revenue, and this growth could drive stock performance. Despite being a net seller of stocks to the tune of $166 billion over the last eight quarters, there are two premier stocks the Oracle of Omaha can't stop buying. Every investor wants to see his portfolio generate a solid return, and there’s no shortage of strategies to achieve this goal. One of the more popular strategies is dividend investing – a timeless approach that continues to stand the test of time. The key here is the long-term total outperformance of the total return. Hartford Funds, after reviewing 50 years’ worth of stock records, demonstrated that dividend stocks generated an average annual return exceeding 9% for the half-century ending in 2 Nvidia and other chip giants in the artificial intelligence space have powered this ETF to incredible long-term returns. A historic Los Angeles home once owned by actor Gene Wilder and later by Elon Musk is heading to foreclosure auction. According to Mansion Global, the property, originally listed for $12.95 million in August, has been significantly reduced to $9.5 ... If you're an investor looking for high-yield investments with some solid upside potential, there is perhaps no better place to look than the energy midstream space. The sector has gone through a transformation in the past decade, with midstream companies reducing leverage and being more disciplined when it comes to funding growth projects. Against that backdrop, let's look a three great MLPs -- Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE: EPD), Energy Transfer (NYSE: ET), and Western Midstream (NYSE: WES) -- investors might want to consider buying and holding forever. There is so much to love about Shopify. Shopify went through a difficult period recently as it tried to build on some of its highest-ever growth and needed to reacclimate to slowing demand, but it's landed on its feet. Nobody can predict the future, but it's not hard to imagine increasing pharmaceutical sales. In 2022, prescription drug spending in the U.S. climbed more than 8% to reach $406 billion. It might not feel like it when you pay the bill, but prescription drugs give healthcare systems a tremendous return on their investment. Warren Buffett told Berkshire Hathaway shareholders in 2022 that anyone advising their kids on how to "make money per point of IQ and per erg of energy, tell them to go to Wall Street." The legendary investor also said he'd bet on monkeys making stock picks before he'd bet on Wall Street. Before we get to what Wall Street thinks was Buffett's smartest move in Q3, I have to point out that analysts disagreed with most of Buffett's recent trades. Sign in to access your portfolio
