Industry minister Francois-Philippe Champagne has led the strategy that’s seen some of the biggest investments in the history of Canada’s auto sector.Tara Walton/The Canadian Press The era of Canada putting down big bets on massive new electric-vehicle battery plants is coming to end. As Industry Minister, François-Philippe Champagne has led the strategy that’s seen Stellantis N.V., STLA-N Volkswagen Group and Honda Motor Co. HNDAF commit to new factories in Ontario that represent some of the biggest investments in the history of Canada’s auto sector. A few months ago, Mr. Champagne was still talking up the possibility of landing one or two more such commitments from global automakers. But in a year-end interview with The Globe and Mail, he acknowledged he’s no longer big-game hunting the same way. Instead, the focus has shifted to solidifying the existing commitments during a turbulent period for the nascent EV sector, and leveraging them to grow out the domestic supply chain that they are meant to anchor. “Now, it’s about consolidation,” Mr. Champagne said, referring in particular to landing and advancing investments in mining and refining battery materials such as lithium, graphite and nickel. Repeatedly invoking a new mantra about the need to achieve greater “speed and scale,” he was tacitly acknowledging that Canada needs to dramatically pick up the pace for the battery plants to be supplied primarily by the country’s ample reserves of critical minerals – access to which was one of the main reasons cited by the automakers for placing the investments here. Mr. Champagne also reflected on how Ottawa’s EV-battery strategy has played out to date, defending the government’s billions of dollars in subsidies, in the face of mounting skepticism resulting from setbacks in the auto sector’s transition to EVs, as it has struggled with slower demand growth than expected. While that bumpiness has not derailed the three landmark battery plants in Ontario, it has jeopardized a fourth planned by Sweden’s struggling Northvolt AB, and seen other retreats such as Ford Motor Co. F-N putting off plans to assemble EVs at its facilities in Oakville, Ont. Quebec says Northvolt battery project will go ahead as company cuts 20% of global staff How much longer Mr. Champagne will be the point-person for the strategy is an open question, given that a federal election early in 2025 appears increasingly likely, and the governing party that he serves faces a double-digit deficit in opinion polls. But his perspective may be useful context for whoever is in office by the end of 2025, and tasked with deciding whether and how to double down on trying to turn Canada into a force in EV-making. One of his arguments is that subsidies for the battery plants will not be nearly as high as most people perceive – particularly when it comes to Stellantis and Volkswagen, which most media reports have suggested will top $28-billion in combined support from the federal and Ontario governments. (The Honda deal has a lower ceiling and is structured differently.) That figure is essentially the maximum total possible, contingent on the plants operating at full capacity from the earliest possible date, because it’s mostly derived from production subsidies per battery made that expire in the early 2030s. An arguable upside of the EV demand-growth slowdown, to which Mr. Champagne implicitly pointed, is that the cost for taxpayers will be lower because the factories – expected to be operational for decades – won’t need to ramp up as quickly. “People have this impression that we have dispersed that money,” he said. “But today, I’ve landed tens of billions of investments, and I’ve only dispersed a few hundred million.” He was somewhat more philosophical on the more negative consequences of the industry’s recent struggles, including for Canada’s large industry of parts-makers and other suppliers at the mercy of automakers’ rapidly shifting timelines for EV roll-outs – framing it as inevitable during a revolutionary industrial change. “If you look at the history of the world, when you have a shift in technology for the next century, the first few years are always bumpy,” he said. “My role, and the role of the industry, is not only to look at next week or next month or next year, but to position Canada for long-term success.” He also suggested that in the near-term, Canada is well-positioned to weather uncertainty around the pace of the shift away from internal combustion engines, because Ontario still has several assembly plants making vehicles with those gas-fuelled motors for the foreseeable future, as well as some (notably Stellantis’s Windsor assembly plant) building flexible platforms that can make both types of vehicles. In a possible nod to current political dynamics in the United States – where most Canadian-made vehicles are sold, and where president-elect Donald Trump’s EV skepticism may or may not be counterbalanced by Elon Musk’s role in his administration – Mr. Champagne repeatedly invoked Tesla Inc. as evidence of the need for patience. He did so on the premises that Tesla had plenty of highs and lows before establishing dominance of the early EV space, and that Tesla’s soaring stock price shows that investors retain faith in EVs ultimately taking over the market. Otherwise, he mostly steered away from commenting on the extent to which Mr. Trump’s threat to impose a 25-per-cent tariff on Canadian exports could hurt all forms of vehicle-making here, other than to express optimism that Mr. Trump’s sensitivity to markets – which could react negatively to massive disruptions of the highly integrated Canada-U.S. supply chain – will help dissuade him. Actually strengthening that supply chain in the coming years is partly contingent on the natural-resource question – whether Canada can kick-start its mining sector enough to supply not just domestic facilities but also U.S. ones, as industries seek to reduce reliance on China – which contributes to the government’s focus shifting upstream. Mr. Champagne touted a few examples of progress over the past couple of years – particularly at the mid-stream level, such as plans for Canada’s first copper-foil factory and a joint venture by General Motors Co. and Posco Chemical Co. Ltd. to produce cathode active materials, both in Quebec. He also noted the multifaceted nature of Honda’s investment in Ontario, which includes partnerships with Posco and with Asahi Kasei Corp. to make battery components. That could carry extra weight since Honda’s recently announced plan to merge with Nissan Motor Corp. to create the world’s third-largest automaker, which is widely seen as an effort to keep pace with Chinese competitors. And Honda chief executive Toshihiro Mibe hinted to The Globe earlier this year that his company is interested in further investing in this country’s natural resources. But while the effort to get more critical minerals to market does not rest entirely with whoever sits in his chair in cabinet – and is contingent on factors ranging from the federal Natural Resources ministry’s efforts to work with provinces to speed up permitting, to infrastructure investments, to the Finance Ministry’s implementation of mining tax incentives – it now requires the sort of entrepreneurial hustle Mr. Champagne brought to landing the battery plants. He acknowledged that it might have seemed more obvious to start upstream and then move downstream. The economic case for subsidizing the battery plants always rested partly on the establishment of a reliable market for Canadian resources, so it’s a significant hitch that Canada is not yet fully prepared to supply them. But Mr. Champagne contended that there was a narrow window during which the automakers were deciding where to situate the battery plants – which has now almost closed, with most such North American commitments already made – and he had to seize it. The alternative, he suggested, would have been to effectively give up on Canada’s long history of making cars and trucks, which was a real prospect a few years ago as a decades-long decline threatened to be worsened by being left behind in the EV shift. “One of the first briefings I got from officials was basically that [I would be] presiding over the end of the auto sector in Canada gradually,” he said. “And we turned what was a challenge into an opportunity.” Whether Canada’s efforts to position itself as a major player in the electrification of transportation hold up as a win in the long-run, though, will depend on the success of its next phase working backward to build a supply chain – whoever is steering it.

Discover the latest stocks recommended by top Wall Street analysts, all in one place with Analyst Top Stocks Make smarter investments with weekly expert stock picks from the Smart Investor Newsletter From the hotly-debated high-flier Tesla (TSLA), Wall Street’s newest darling Rivian (RIVN), traditional-stalwarts turned EV-upstarts GM (GM) and Ford (F) to the numerous SPAC-deal makers that have come public in this red-hot space, The Fly has you covered with “Charged,” a weekly recap of the top stories and expert calls in the sector. Q4 DELIVERIES: Barclays expects Tesla to report Q4 deliveries of 515,000 units, up 6% year-over-year and just above the consensus estimate of 511,000. A beat could keep the stock’s narrative momentum strong, but the focus on Tesla’s fundamentals is limited overall, the firm tells investors in a research note. Barclays believes a slight near-term volume miss “would likely do little to dampen” Tesla’s autonomous vehicle and artificial intelligence push, which it says has recently come into greater focus ahead of the planned “Unsupervised FSD” launch in 2025. Conversely, a slight beat on Q4 is likely immaterial to the majority of the current Tesla bull case, the firm adds. It keeps an Equal Weight rating on Tesla with a $270 price target. NOT AS POSITIVE: Barclays also said it believes the post-election rally in shares of Tesla reflects a “sharp disconnect” between the stock and the company’s fundamentals. Technicals and options are playing an outsized role in the rally, the firm tells investors in a research note. Barclays believes Tesla shares are now best comped to crypto. There are little incremental positives to Tesla’s fundamentals from the election, but Elon Musk’s premium is now elevated, contends the firm. The last six weeks “serve as a reminder that Tesla remains a narrative king within the market, with fundamentals cast aside,” it adds. While 2025 consensus earnings estimates are up slightly in the past six weeks, Tesla’s multiple has increased to a “frothy” 145-times 2025 numbers, up from 80-times immediately pre-election, Barclays points out. It calls Trump’s “not as positive as you’d think” for Tesla’s fundamentals. The firm keeps an Equal Weight rating on Tesla with a $270 price target. AV DEPLOYMENT: Tesla is in early talks with the authorities in the city of Austin, Texas, about its autonomous vehicle technology, Bloomberg’s Kara Carlson reports. A Tesla employee has been in touch with the city’s autonomous vehicle task force since at least May to establish safety expectations for the vehicles, the report says, citing emails acquired by public records requests.

SOLAR INDUSTRY: Roth MKM notes that the American Active Anode Material Producers has filed anti-dumping and countervailing duty petitions against imports of active anode material from China with alleged average dumping margins from 828%-921%, adding that the firm believes this case could have “a wide range of impacts” as the petition covers active anode material regardless of whether it is imported independently, as part of a compound, or in a battery. Roth, which believes the anode typically represents about 10%-15% of the cost of a battery, says a potential added tariff cost could be “disruptive to the industry” and a negative for suppliers that source anode material from China, directly or indirectly. Some names that the firm says could be impacted include Fluence Energy (FLNC), Stem (STEM), Enphase (ENPH), SolarEdge (SEDG), Energy Vault (NRGV), Clearway Energy (CWEN), Enlight (ENLT), Ormat (ORA), Sunnova (NOVA) and Sunrun (RUN). BUY SUNRUN: TD Cowen initiated coverage of Sunrun with a Buy rating and $21 price target. The company is positioned to drive contracted subscriber value growth, supported by higher battery attachment and investment tax credit levels along with fixed cost absorption, through its scale and “leading” residential solar financier market share, the firm tells investors in a research note. TD Cowen says Sunrun will raise non-recourse debt against contracted subscriber value, providing confidence its 2025 cash generation targets are achievable.

Title: Jim Cramer Says Ford Motor (F) Is in Trouble – Here’s Why

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Jim Cramer’s Latest Calls Before 2025 Begins: Top 10 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F) stands against other stocks in Jim Cramer’s latest calls before 2025 begins. Jim Cramer in a latest program talked about the market reaction to the Federal Reserve’s latest rate cut and its guidance that suggested fewer rate cuts moving ahead. “I guess you could say the baby got thrown out with the bathwater. It was truly hideous, a little unexpected, and yes, wicked. Even though the market’s barely oversold, we may not get that quick snapback we normally expect in a deeply oversold market,” Cramer said. Jim Cramer said Jerome Powell’s comments and tone were “stern” and his conference call “confounded” investors. Cramer said inflation has not come down enough and that has made the Fed’s job difficult. Cramer then talked about different sectors and companies that need rate cuts amid a slowdown. “I really wish the Fed hadn’t been so defensive about the need to cut rates going forward. A slower approach would have been much better. If they had explicitly taken a wait-and-see approach before this meeting, we’d be in a better position. This time, they telegraphed the wrong thing, hence today’s meltdown. However, if the weaker part of the economy deteriorates further or inflation comes down, the Fed still has room to cut. Here’s the bottom line: a previously data-dependent Fed chose not to be data-dependent today with its pronouncements, and that’s what drove the market down. This happened despite the quarter-point rate cut—something that’s typically good news for stocks—but it turned out to be the very opposite.” READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In For this article, we watched some latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 11 stocks he is talking about. With each company, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A Ford truck roaring down a highway, with powerful headlights blazing its way. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 36 Jim Cramer in a latest program on CNBC expressed his concerns over rising warranty costs of Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F) and said the stock does not have a lot of “MOJO.” “Ford does not have a lot of mojo in this note by Jefferies. This is one of the reasons—what can save the Fed when they cut. Ford has an inventory drifting up to 96 days. That says to me price cut, way too much, way too much. And by the way, that’s far more than GM—26. Wow. I mean, GM and Stellantis have much lower inventories.” Ford shares have gained about 10% over the past 10 years, a stark contrast to the S&P 500’s 250%. Legacy automakers like Ford are grappling with challenges from newer competitors, the shift to electric vehicles (EVs), and the rapid rise of autonomous technology. Ford’s Model e segment continues to drain cash as Ford works to strengthen its EV business. While the company has some strong products, it faces stiff competition from Tesla, Inc. (TSLA), Rivian Automotive, Inc. (RIVN), and other EV makers, leading to significant losses. Year-to-date, Ford’s EBIT has dropped to $8.1 billion, down from $9.4 billion in the same period last year. Ford’s struggle to reduce warranty costs remains a concern. The company issued 62 recalls in 2024, far surpassing General Motors Company (GM), which had 33. Since 2021, Ford has had the industry’s highest recall rate, reflecting poorly on management’s efforts to lower warranty expenses and damaging the brand’s reputation. Overall, F ranks 10th on our list of Jim Cramer’s latest calls before 2025 begins. While we acknowledge the potential of F, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.
