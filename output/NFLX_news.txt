Following these reports, the stock experienced a negative one-day return 12 times, with a median of -7% and max 1D negative returns of -35%. These aren’t comforting numbers. That said, we like a lot about Netflix, especially right now. Ramp-up of Live TV and sports is one. We explain the positives and negatives below. Netflix is scheduled to release its Q1 2025 earnings on Thursday, April 17, 2025. According to consensus estimates, revenue is expected to rise by approximately 12% to around $10.5 billion, while earnings per share are projected to be about $5.73. This growth is anticipated to be fueled by Netflix’s robust subscriber additions throughout 2024—totaling over 40 million—and its recent price increases. In January, the company raised the standard HD plan by $2.50 to $18 per month and increased the Premium plan to $25 per month. Netflix posted strong subscriber gains in 2024, driven by its crackdown on password-sharing and the growth of its ad-supported tier. However, this momentum could ease in 2025. Additionally, intensifying competition could contribute to elevated churn or slower growth in new subscriptions. Netflix’s decision to discontinue reporting subscriber figures might indicate that it expects growth to taper off this year. Margins will also be a key focus this quarter. The company’s content expenses are set to climb as it expands further into live sports programming, including NFL games and WWE wrestling, which are typically higher-cost content segments. Netflix currently holds a market capitalization of $404 billion. Over the past twelve months, the company generated $39 billion in revenue, with $10 billion in operating profit and $8.7 billion in net income.
