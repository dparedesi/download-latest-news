ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Netflix stock (NASDAQ: NFLX) has experienced significant growth, increasing by approximately 35% this year and over 70% in the last twelve months. The stock is now priced at over $1,200. This substantial rise follows two strategic decisions made by Netflix after the pandemic: enforcing restrictions on password sharing and introducing a more affordable, ad-supported tier. Both strategies have proven effective, enhancing subscriber numbers and providing a considerable revenue boost, with Q2 sales increasing by 16% compared to the previous year. Clearly, things have been going well. However, here lies the issue – these strategies are now being utilized in most markets, content expenses are rising, competitors are active, and the stock is currently valued for absolute success. When performance is so strong, it can be tempting for investors to assume that this momentum will continue indefinitely. This is precisely when potential risks are often overlooked. In 2024 alone, Netflix added more than 40 million subscribers, bringing its paid subscriber total to nearly 302 million, marking the largest annual growth in its history. The crackdown on password-sharing has encouraged users to either pay additional fees for extra access or enroll independently. Moreover, the ad-supported tier, which offers a more budget-friendly entry option, has experienced robust uptake, with more than half of new subscribers in eligible markets opting for this plan in the latest quarter. These changes have opened up new revenue avenues and reignited growth after a plateau following the pandemic. Nevertheless, there are growing concerns regarding future developments. With both strategies already in place in significant markets, maintaining the same rate of subscriber growth could be challenging. Additionally, Netflix has declared that it will cease reporting subscriber figures starting in 2025, signaling expectations for slower growth going forward. The competition is intensifying once again. Disney+, Amazon Prime Video, and Apple TV+ are reinforcing their focus on content and bundling initiatives. While Netflix’s extensive content library and scale still provide it an advantage, competitors are capitalizing on unique strengths. For example, Disney packages Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ together for as low as $17 per month, making the service more engaging and reducing subscriber turnover. Importantly, Disney can justify its substantial streaming investments because it profits from its intellectual property across parks, merchandise, and film releases. See How Disney Stock Can Surge To $230 Despite the surge in subscriber numbers, concerns regarding pricing, expenses, and broader economic conditions persist. Netflix has continuously raised subscription rates. Its premium plan now costs $25 per month, while the standard HD plan has increased by $2.50 to $18. While price increases may enhance margins in the short term, they also pose a risk of alienating cost-conscious users, particularly amid higher inflation and tariffs which could impact disposable income. Content costs represent another hurdle. Netflix has ventured into live sports broadcasting, including NFL games and WWE wrestling, which come with higher production and licensing expenses. Although margins improved in Q2, management has warned that operating margins could decline in the latter half of 2025 due to increased amortization and marketing expenses linked to its new offerings. Netflix is projected to spend over $20 billion yearly on content by 2026, an increase from approximately $17 billion in 2024. At its current valuation, Netflix trades at roughly 47 times the consensus earnings for 2025, compared to about 20 times in mid-2022. This premium valuation presumes that the company can maintain double-digit growth and margin expansion in the long term. However, consensus forecasts indicate revenue growth of only 15% to 13% for 2025 and 2026, which falls short of its historical growth rate. With increasing costs, slowing subscriber additions, and rising competition, Netflix may struggle to substantiate its current valuation. In contrast, Disney stock trades at approximately 20 times forward earnings with a market cap of $200 billion, while its direct-to-consumer segments generated $24.15 billion in revenue over the past 12 months compared to Netflix’s $41 billion. This suggests that Disney’s valuation may be underestimated given its strengths in streaming and highlights why Netflix’s inflated stock price might face downward pressure if growth slows.
