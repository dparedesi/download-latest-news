US stocks faltered on Thursday, pulling back from a bid for fresh records as AI optimism waned and markets waited for more detail on President Donald Trump's tariff plans. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was little changed, coming off a three-day win streak that saw the benchmark index close Wednesday on the cusp of setting a new all-time high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) traded 0.2% higher, with a record high not far off. Meanwhile, The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell 0.4% as tech stocks struggled to regain the momentum that propelled the previous day's gains. Nvidia (NVDA) shares dropped, as fellow megacap techs Apple (AAPL) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) also lost ground. Investors are still digesting Trump's early-days policy charge, which brought an AI push that invigorated tech names but left unclear when the outlined tariffs on big trading partners — a risk for inflation and stocks — might hit. The focus is now on Trump's speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos later Thursday for more insight into his trade policy. Yahoo Finance is on the ground at Davos. See the latest from the world's business leaders here. Shares in Amazon (AMZN) and Tesla (TSLA) edged lower after business shifts by the tech leaders in Canada, a prime tariff target for Trump. The e-commerce giant will close its warehouses in Quebec, with a loss of about 1,700 jobs, while Tesla plans hefty price hikes on all its EV models sold in Canada. Eyes are on earnings to potentially buoy markets, after Netflix (NFLX) set that tone on Wednesday. GE Aerospace (GE) shares popped after the jet engine maker said it will raise share buybacks to $7 billion. In air carriers, American Airlines (AAL) stock slid after a downbeat 2025 profit forecast, and Alaska Airlines (ALK) shares rose thanks to a smaller-than-expected first quarter loss forecast. On the data front, US jobless claims increased by 6,000 to 223,000, official figures released on Thursday showed. Economists had expected a reading of 220,000 for the week. Electronic Arts (EA) stock tumbled 15% on Thursday after the game publisher said quarterly bookings fell to roughly $2.22 billion, missing analyst expectations. The decline was due to poor performance of two of its video games: its soccer title, EA Sports FC 2025, and Dragon Age: The Veilguard. Both of those missed expectations. The company cut its bookings outlook for the 2025 fiscal year to a range of $7 billion to $7.15 billion. EA is expected to release its complete results on February 4. US stocks were mixed on Thursday, pulling back from near record levels as the markets awaited a speech from President trump at the World Economic Forum in Davos. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) slipped roughly 0.2%, coming off a record intraday high on Wednesday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was little changed. Meanwhile, The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell 0.5% as tech stocks struggled. Nvidia (NVDA) shares sliped along with Apple (AAPL) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL).

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks were mixed Thursday as investors stayed attuned to remarks from President Donald Trump, who addressed the World Economic Forum in Davos. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose more than 0.1%, coming off a three-day win streak that saw the benchmark index close Wednesday on the cusp of setting a new all-time high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) traded 0.6% higher, with a record not far off. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell around 0.2% as tech stocks struggled to regain the momentum that propelled the previous day's gains. Nvidia (NVDA) shares dropped after its supplier SK Hynix (000660.KS) flagged uncertainty about chip demand this year, which also weighed on other related stocks. The focus turned to Trump's remote speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos for more insight into his trade policy. The president said he will "demand that interest rates drop immediately." He also said he will ask OPEC to bring down the price of oil. On the tariff front, the president offered a warning to companies. "If you don't make your product in America, which is your prerogative, then very simply you will have to pay a tariff — differing amounts, but a tariff." Investors are still digesting Trump's early-days policy charge, which brought an AI push that invigorated tech names but left unclear when the outlined tariffs on big trading partners — a risk for inflation and stocks — might hit. Yahoo Finance is on the ground at Davos. See the latest from the world's business leaders here. Meanwhile, eyes are on earnings to potentially buoy markets, after Netflix (NFLX) set the stage for next week's Big Tech flurry. On the data front, US jobless claims increased by 6,000 to 223,000, official figures released on Thursday showed. Economists had expected a reading of 220,000 for the week. President Trump said he will ask the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), led by Saudi Arabia to bring down the price of oil. "I'm also going to ask Saudi Arabia and OPEC to bring down the cost of oil. You've got to bring it down," said Trump during his remote speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. "If the price came down, the Russia-Ukraine war would end immediately. Right now the price is high enough that that war will continue, you've got to bring down the oil price. You've got to end that war," he said. Russia, a major producer of oil and gas, is an OPEC ally. The cartel currently has production cuts in place in order to keep a floor on prices. Both West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) and Brent (BZ=F) fell roughly 1% following Trump's comments. President Trump said he will demand that interest rates drop in the US. "I’ll demand that interest rates drop immediately, and likewise, they should be dropping all over the world. Interest rates should follow us,” Trump said remotely at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) moved to a session high, up 0.5% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.2%. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell slightly. President Trump spoke remotely at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, appearing via video to a packed room of CEOs and world officials. The President first listed a series of actions he took upon entering the White House, including withdrawing from the Paris climate accord and declaring a national energy emergency. On the topic of tariffs, the President said: "My message to every business in the world is very simple: Come make your product in America, and we will give you among the lowest taxes of any nation on Earth." "But if you don't make your product in America, which is your prerogative, then very simply you will have to pay a tariff — differing amounts, but a tariff. Attendees at the World Economic Forum in Davos are waiting for President Trump's special address via video. Investors watching the remote speech will pay attention to any talk about the President's tariff policy. President Trump will also take questions after his remarks. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) rose after Republican Sen. Cynthia Lummis said in a post on X that she will chair the Senate Banking Subcommittee on digital assets. The token moved up to about $105,000 at around 10:50 a.m. ET. Earlier this week, Lummis said she spoke with Eric Trump about the possibility of creating a strategic bitcoin reserve at the inaugural lunch on Monday. Late last year, she introduced a proposal that would give the Federal Reserve the right to own the cryptocurren. Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports: Chip stocks fell across the board early on Thursday after a Nvidia (NVDA) supplier made comments on its earnings call that indicated uncertainty about semiconductor demand this year. South Korea-based SK Hynix (000660.KS) makes memory chips for Nvidia’s GPUs (graphics processing units), which are used in data centers to underpin artificial intelligence software. After SK Hynix reported fourth quarter earnings that surpassed analysts’ expectations, its head of finance, Woo-Hyun Kim, painted a careful picture of the year ahead. “2025's memory demand outlook is clouded by inventory adjustments from PC and smartphone OEMs [original equipment manufacturers] as well as strengthened protective trade policies and geopolitical risks,” Kim said on a post-earnings conference call. Following the comments, Nvidia shares sank as much as 2%. British chip designer Arm's (ARM) stock dropped nearly 6%, and SK Hynix rival Micron (MU) shares fell roughly 4%. Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi reports from Davos: Up and down the promenade at the World Economic Forum this week, leaders agree on one thing about artificial intelligence: It's darn powerful, and it's starting to materially impact how business is done and will be done. Think AI on the cusp of rendering human call centers and HR departments obsolete. What leaders can't agree on is whether AI is already out of control — whether it's beyond the point of being successfully regulated or having the proper guardrails. "I'm not sure it's [AI] out of control. I think there are use cases that sometimes people want to showcase [for] ... their own benefits, to see, hey, this is the potential. But the reality is that enterprises are very smart," HPE CEO Antonio Neri told Yahoo Finance at the annual gathering of top business leaders. Read more here. American Airlines (AAL) stock fell nearly 8% after the carrier forecast a surprise loss for its first quarter. The outlook is a departure from the major air travel carriers' bullish performance in recent quarters. American expects an adjusted loss of as much as $0.40 a share for the current quarter. Analysts were expecting a profit of at least $0.01, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The airline posted record fourth quarter revenue of $13.7 billion and record full-year revenue of $54.2 billion. The company's profit for the current quarter is expected to be impacted by a rise in non-fuel expenses as it continues to win back business after changing its corporate sales strategy. American had implemented changes that pushed corporate customers to book directly with the airline, instead of third-party travel managers. Electronic Arts (EA) stock tumbled 15% on Thursday after the game publisher said quarterly bookings fell to roughly $2.22 billion, missing analyst expectations. The decline was due to the poor performance of two of its video games: soccer title "EA Sports FC 2025" and "Dragon Age: The Veilguard." Both of those missed bookings expectations. The company cut its bookings outlook for the 2025 fiscal year to a range of $7 billion to $7.15 billion. EA is expected to release its complete results on Feb. 4. US stocks were mixed on Thursday, pulling back from near record levels as the markets awaited a speech from President Trump at the World Economic Forum.

Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell 0.5% as tech stocks struggled. Nvidia (NVDA) shares slipped, along with those of Apple (AAPL) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL).

Title: Good Grief, Look How Much Wall Street Thinks Netflix Is Worth Now

Netflix had an incredible final quarter of 2024, and today the company — and its investors — are reaping the spoils. Shares in Netflix (NFLX on the NASDAQ) skyrocketed $100 apiece on Tuesday afternoon following the release of the company’s fourth-quarter financials. In a letter to shareholders, Netflix revealed record growth of nearly 19 million subscribers, absolutely blowing away media analysts’ forecasts. Netflix revenue topped $10 billion, though its quarterly profit declined. No matter, there’s a fix for that: Netflix also announced price increases across each of its subscription plans. In turn, Netflix forecast better-than-previously-expected revenue growth for the current quarter, Q1 of 2025. Wall Street loves that stuff. Related Stories How the ‘Dimension 20’ Team Is Min-Maxing For Madison Square Garden The International Oscars Are Here to Stay How much? We can quantify that. When the stock exchanges opened this morning, NFLX shares nearly hit $1,000 apiece (instead settling for an all-time high of $999). Netflix’s market cap is now north of $400 billion; remember when Blockbuster Video passed on buying the company at $50 million? For some recent perspective on the surge in Netflix’s valuation, in fall 2021, before The Great Netflix Correction, shares appeared to be headed for $700. After reporting a shocking loss in subscribers in the first quarter of 2022, shares of NFLX dropped below $200. It’s been quite the comeback. And media analysts see no ceiling. Well, that’s not entirely correct — it’s more like they just vaulted the ceiling to the roofline. Jessica Reif Ehrlich, a research analyst for Bank of America and a regular interviewer on Netflix’s earnings “call” (Netflix for many years conducted a prerecorded video interview format and not a live call), already saw NFLX at being worth $1,000; now, she’s all the way up to $1,175. Jason Helstein of Oppenheimer raised his own target from $1,040 to $1,150. It’s a popular price target (PT): Tim Nollen from Macquarie is at the same number, up from $965. As is Alicia Reese of Wedbush, now $200 above her prior $950 target; John Hodulik of UBS is also at $1,150, up a whole $10 from his prior PT of $1,140. Mark Mahaney of Evercore ISI is up from $950 to $1,100. Barton Crockett of Rosenblatt Securities is either nuts or a prophet — not to be confused with “profit,” which is what you would make if his investment advice comes true — hiking his price target all the way from $680 to $1,494. Somebody wake the boys at Deutsche Bank: Bryan Kraft, Spencer Amer, Benjamin Soff, and Victor-A Odiwuor are at $875 per share. They’re either late to the party or just slow-playing: DB’s prior NFLX PT was $650. With $1,000 clearly in sight, Netflix could be headed for its first stock split in a decade. While none of this (from us) should be considered investment advice, it does have my IndieWire 401k wondering: Where can I find a time machine back to the DVD days?

The streaming giant finished 2024 with with 302 million memberships. The company also announced price hikes across most plans in the U.S., Canada, Portugal, and Argentina. Netflix’s standard ad-free plan will now cost $17.99 a month, up from $15.49. Meanwhile, the ad-support plan will increase from $6.99 to $7.99 per month. These price hikes were already factored into Netflix’s 2025 forecast it provided in Oct. 2024. Additionally, the company said it will no longer report paid memberships and average revenue per member starting in the first quarter of 2025. Revenue climbed 16% year-over-year, driven by hits like Squid Game season 2 and Carry-On, which joined Netflix’s top 10 films. Shares of Netflix jumped by over 13% in after-hours trading. The fourth quarter spike in viewership was also bolstered by major events, including the Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson fight, which became Netflix’s “most-streamed sporting event ever.” Christmas day brought the most-streamed National Football League (NFL) games in Netflix history, pushing operating income up by 25%. Beyoncé’s “Beyoncé Bowl” also helped drive 50 million viewers. The company expects revenue to reach between $43.5 billion and $44.5 billion, up $500 million from earlier projections. Additionally, it says it’s focusing on strengthening its core business by offering more popular content, improving the user experience, and expanding it ads business. The company also plans to get into new areas, such as live programming and gaming. “We’re optimistic heading into the new year,” Netflix said, emphasizing its focus on creating content that continues to resonate with audiences and that will “pierce the cultural zeitgeist.” In 2025, Netflix is gearing up for the return of two major hits, Stranger Things and Wednesday.

Title: Netflix earnings preview: Sports to boost Q4 results as analysts debate future price hikes

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Netflix (NFLX) is set to report its fiscal fourth quarter earnings on Tuesday after market close. Analysts expect the streamer to deliver strong results after it ended the year with two back-to-back NFL games, a successful "Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson" boxing match, and the return of "Squid Game." Netflix stock has stumbled since the start of the year after finishing 2024 at record highs. The stock pullback comes as macroeconomic uncertainties have weighed broadly on megacap Big Tech. Here's what Wall Street expects for the fourth quarter, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates: Revenue: $10.11 billion (Netflix's guidance: $10.13 billion) versus $8.83 billion in Q4 2023 Earnings per share: $4.18 (Netflix's guidance: $4.23) versus $2.11 in Q4 2023 Net subscriber additions: 9.18 million versus 13.12 million in Q4 2023 "There are very high expectations going into this quarter," Geetha Ranganathan, senior analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, told Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief program. "But it's really the perfect setup for Netflix." Ranganathan called out the company's solid content slate, describing it as "one of their strongest quarters ever," as live sports programming dominated the platform. Notably, the Jake Paul and Mike Tyson match attracted over 108 million global viewers, becoming the most-streamed sporting event of all time. For context, the 2024 Super Bowl, which was the most-watched American TV broadcast ever, pulled in 124 million US viewers. Similarly, the NFL games averaged around 30 million viewers. According to Netflix, it was its most-watched Christmas Day game ever in the US. "It's going to be really interesting to see how [sports] shapes the future of Netflix," Ranganathan said, adding the recent debut of WWE Raw will drive further growth and retention. "This is really the big shift we're going to see this quarter," she said. "That's going to drive subscriber momentum for Netflix in a big way. We're expecting well over 10 million subscriber additions." This will be the last earnings report in Netflix's history revealing net subscriber figures. The company announced last spring it would stop reporting the metric at the start of this year. Investors have recognized the company's efforts over the past year, which, in addition to a strong content slate, have included more advertising successes. According to its latest update, Netflix's ad tier, now two years old, has reached 70 million global monthly active users. The stock has surged about 80% year over year. It hit several all-time highs in 2024, as many analysts call Netflix the winner of the hard-fought streaming wars. Still, the company revealed in its latest biannual viewership report that year-over-year engagement levels came in roughly flat — a potential headwind when it comes to its ability to raise prices and boost growth. Netflix last raised the price of its Standard plan in January 2022, upping the monthly cost to $15.49 from $13.99. It also raised the price of its Premium tier by $2 to $19.99 a month at the same time; the company again raised the cost of that plan last October to $22.99. The company has yet to raise the price of its ad-supported offering, which remains one of the cheapest ad plans among all of the major streaming players at $6.99 a month. "We've been expecting a price increase in the US market for quite a while now," Ranganathan said. "They're definitely long overdue." The company recently phased out its lowest-priced ad-free streaming plan, making the $15.49 Standard plan its cheapest offering for an ad-free experience. Valuation has also been a concern, with analysts expecting a downward revision to the company's 2025 revenue outlook, due, in part, to the strengthening dollar. Currently, Netflix anticipates revenue growth between 11% and 13%, a slowdown from last year's 15% growth rate. "I think they'll temper those revenue growth projections," Ranganathan predicted. "But I think the way that they offset that is with a big price increase, which could happen anytime this year." Alexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

From January 21st through February 15th, price has risen over 85% of the time over the last 22 years. Daily, the stock is oversold. Weekly, we can see that relative strength has been rising since the spring of 2022. The monthly cycle has led price higher, and there is no cycle high until May.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. • Trump inauguration, Q4 earnings season will be in focus in the holiday-shortened week ahead. • With its transformative business model and clear growth trajectory, Netflix looks like a compelling buy for investors seeking quality growth. • Procter & Gamble faces operational challenges and tepid growth, making it less appealing in the current market environment. • Looking for more actionable trade ideas? Subscribe here for 50% off InvestingPro! U.S. stocks rallied on Friday ahead of the inauguration of Donald Trump, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 had their best week since the November election amid signs of easing inflation. For the week, the Dow and S&P 500 advanced 3.7% and 2.9%, respectively, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed 2.5%. Source: Investing.com The week ahead is expected to be another eventful one as investors continue to gauge the outlook for the economy and interest rates. U.S. markets will be closed Monday for the Martin Luther King holiday. President-elect Trump’s inauguration also will be Monday, with the incoming president expected to issue a flurry of day one executive orders. Source: Investing.com Meanwhile, the fourth quarter earnings season shifts into high gear, with reports expected from several high-profile companies, including Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), American Express (NYSE:AXP), Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Verizon (NYSE:VZ), GE Aerospace (NYSE:GE), 3M Company (NYSE:MMM), United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL). Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies will also be closely watched. Regardless of which direction the market goes, below I highlight one stock likely to be in demand and another which could see fresh downside. Remember though, my timeframe is just for the week ahead, Monday, January 20 - Friday, January 24. For investors looking to allocate capital this week, Netflix stands out as a strong growth opportunity. The streaming giant’s shift to advertising, live events, and monetization of popular content like ‘Squid Game’ are significant tailwinds that could propel the stock higher in the week ahead. The Los Gatos, California-based Internet television network is scheduled to release its fourth-quarter update after the U.S. market closes on Tuesday at 4:00PM ET. A call with co-CEO’s Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters is set for 5:00PM ET. Market participants expect a sizable swing in NFLX stock after the print drops, according to the options market, with a possible implied move of nearly 9% in either direction. The stock rose 8.8% after the last earnings report came out in mid-October. Source: InvestingPro Profit estimates have been revised upward 27 times in the last 90 days, reflecting growing confidence among analysts. Only four downward revisions have been noted, underscoring Wall Street’s bullish sentiment toward the entertainment powerhouse. Netflix is seen earning $4.21 per share, representing a staggering 99% increase from the prior year. Meanwhile, revenue is forecast to increase 15% year-over-year to $10.1 billion. The company has shifted its focus from pure subscriber growth to prioritizing operating margins and revenue expansion. This pivot includes a robust advertising model, which is becoming a cornerstone of its growth strategy. On the content front, the blockbuster release of ‘Squid Game Season 2’ and other high-profile projects ensures a steady stream of engagement. Netflix is also venturing into live events, including NFL games and boxing matches, expanding its appeal to a broader audience. NFLX stock ended at $858.10 last Friday. At current levels, Netflix has a market cap of $366.8 billion. Shares are down 3.7% to start 2025 after scoring an annual gain of 83% last year. Source: Investing.com It is worth mentioning that Netflix has a great InvestingPro Financial Health Score of 3.1/5.0, reflecting its strong financials, robust growth prospects, and innovative strategies.

On the other hand, Procter & Gamble faces operational challenges and tepid growth, making it less attractive in the current market environment. The global consumer products company is scheduled to report its fiscal second quarter earnings report before the stock market opens on Wednesday at 6:55AM ET. The expected move in the options market is about 3.4% up or down. Shares fell 1.6% after the last earnings report came out in October. Underscoring several challenges facing Procter & Gamble, 18 out of the 19 analysts surveyed by InvestingPro cut their sales estimates ahead of the print, citing soft consumer demand and a challenging outlook. Source: InvestingPro P&G is seen earning $1.86 per share, increasing just 1.1% from EPS of $1.84 in the year-ago period. Meanwhile, revenue is forecast to inch up 2.2% year-over-year to $21.6 billion. These modest growth projections reflect increasing challenges for the company. The consumer goods giant recently faced operational disruptions, including a ransomware attack on one of its shipping vendors. The attack could weigh on distribution efficiency and hurt margins in the short term. Moreover, rising competition in key markets and inflationary pressures on raw materials are expected to limit profitability. As such, CEO Jon Moeller may strike a cautious tone and give soft guidance to reflect supply chain disruptions and weakening margins. PG stock closed last Friday’s session at $161.13, not far from its lowest level since April 2024. At its current valuation, the Cincinnati-based consumer goods company has a market cap of $379.5 billion. Shares are down 3.8% to start the new year. Source: Investing.com Although P&G remains a dominant player in the consumer goods sector with strong brands like Tide and Gillette, its growth is slowing, and the stock appears fully valued. Trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 23.7, the shares may not offer much upside at current levels.

Title: Stocks Await More Earnings After Strong Start And Better Inflation
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2025/01/19/stocks-await-more-earnings-after-strong-start-and-better-inflation/

Last week, better bank earnings and friendly details within inflation data, sent stocks and bonds ... [+] higher. This week the focus will be on more fourth-quarter earnings and politics, with the Trump administration taking power and likely to begin making policy changes. Within the S&P 500, 20 companies reported earnings last week, dominated by large bank earnings. Seventy-nine percent of S&P 500 firms reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. The pace of the third-quarter earnings season picks up this week, with 40 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. S&P 500 Earnings Season Better bank earnings and friendly inflation readings sent bond yields lower and stocks higher. The S&P 500 rose 2.9% for the week, and the Magnificent 7 gained 2.0%. The Magnificent 7 consists of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Tesla (TSLA). Notably, bank stocks soared 8.2% on the back of better earnings. Market Performance While headline consumer inflation (CPI) rose to 2.9% year-over-year, there was better news beneath the surface. The rate of services inflation continued to decelerate. If this easing in services prices continues, combined with the likely deceleration in housing costs, the headline inflation rate should begin to moderate again. Headline & Services Inflation Until relief came last week, rising bond yields had begun to weigh on stock prices. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield had approached 4.8% on January 14 after being as low as 3.6% in mid-September 2024. Interestingly, the rise in yields has been primarily due to the increase in real (after-inflation expectations) yield rather than increasing inflation expectations. The better details within last week’s inflation reading sent the 10-year Treasury yield down to 4.6%. 10-Year Treasury Note: Yield Decomposition Banks make up a sizable portion of this week's earnings reporters, but other companies reporting are 3M (MMM), Netflix (NFLX), Procter & Gamble (PG), and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ). The financial sector contributed most significantly to last week's earnings growth improvement. According to FactSet data, JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS), and Bank of America (BAC) were the most significant contributors to the increase in earnings for the financial sector, which rose to 47.5% from 39.3%. Generally speaking, loan growth remained modest for the banks in the fourth quarter, but capital markets activity significantly boosted earnings. Bank Loans: Year-Over-Year Change The financial sector is expected to show the most rapid year-over-year growth rate in the S&P 500, followed by the powerful technology and communications services duo. Bringing up the rear is the energy sector, with a forecasted almost 30% decline in year-over-year earnings. 4Q 2024 Estimated Earnings Growth By Sector Because these companies are a critical driver of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 are again the group to watch this earnings season. According to FactSet, the Magnificent 7’s earnings are expected to grow by 21.7% year-over-year versus 9.7% for the rest of the S&P 500. The Magnificent 7 earnings aren’t scheduled to begin until the week of January 27. Magnificent 7: Fourth-Quarter Estimated Earnings Growth The significant decline in oil prices year-over-year should result in the expected earnings decline for the energy sector and weigh on materials. Energy Commodities Price Change The strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the fourth quarter will likely depress international earnings growth at the margin. U.S. Dollar Strengthens Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. At this point in the earnings season, sales growth at 4.7% has slightly exceeded expectations, with the tailwind from an estimated 5% year-over-year nominal GDP growth. GDP & S&P 500 Sales Growth Sales growth is expected to be the most robust in the technology sector, with the energy sector predicted to show a decline in year-over-year revenue due to lower oil prices. 4Q 2024 Estimates Sales Growth By Sector Primarily due to the robust earnings growth for the banks, the blended earnings performance has outperformed expectations at the end of the quarter. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at +12.5% year-over-year, above the expectation of +11.9% at the end of the quarter. S&P 500 Earnings Estimate Summary With few meaningful economic releases this week, markets are likely to be dominated by earnings and politics. President Donald Trump’s inauguration on Monday could unleash a wave of policy announcements, which could lead to some volatility in the impacted sectors. While the banks provided a solid start to the earnings season, this week’s reporters should give a glimpse into additional sectors and a strong dose of additional banks. Forward earnings guidance for 2025 will be watched closely as double-digit profit growth expectations are baked into consensus estimates.
