Title: Watch These Key Netflix Price Levels as Stock Drops After Disappointing Earnings
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/watch-these-key-netflix-price-levels-as-stock-drops-after-disappointing-earnings-11834484
Time Published: 2025-10-22T12:46:39Z
Full Content:
Netflix (NFLX) shares tumbled in premarket trading Wednesday after the streaming giant 's third-quarter earnings came in short of Wall Street expectations. The company posted earnings per share of $5.87, compared with the $6.92 EPS that analysts tracked by Visible Alpha had anticipated. Executives said an unplanned charge tied to an "ongoing dispute with Brazilian tax authorities" weighed on profitability in the quarter. Revenue rose 17% from the year-earlier period to $11.51 billion, in line with analysts' estimates, and Netflix projected another 17% increase in the fourth quarter, driven by membership growth, pricing adjustments and increased ad revenue. Netflix shares were down more than 7% at around $1,150 in recent premarket trading. Through yesterday's close, the stock had risen 40% since the start of the year, far outpacing the 15% gain of the benchmark S&P 500 index over the period. Below, we take a closer look at the Netflix chart and use technical analysis to identify key price levels that investors will likely be watching. After hitting their record high in late June, Netflix shares have consolidated within a descending triangle, a bearish chart pattern that signals a potential move lower. Indeed, the stock looks set to tumble toward the pattern’s lower trendline following the streamer’s weaker-than-expected earnings report, reinforcing a downward bias. Let’s point out two key support levels to watch on the Netflix chart amid the possibility for further weakness and also identify overhead areas worth monitoring during future recovery efforts. A decisive volume-backed breakdown below the descending triangle could see the shares initially test a key support level around $1,065. This area on the chart may attract buying interest near the stock’s prominent February swing high. Further downside could see a more-significant drop to the $942 level. Investors may seek buying opportunities in this location near last December’s peak, which also closely aligns with a series of corresponding price action on the chart between January and April. It’s worth noting this area also sits in the same neighborhood as a bearish measured move target that calculates the width of the descending triangle near its widest section in points and deducts that amount from the pattern’s lower trendline. Recovery efforts in the stock back toward the descending triangle’s upper trendline could see the shares test the $1,265 area. The price may run into overhead resistance at this level near a trendline that connects peaks on the chart in June and September. Finally, buying above this area could propel a bullish move to around $1,341. Investors who have bought Netflix shares during its consolidation period in recent months may decide to lock in profits around the stock’s all-time high.

Title: Investors Pause To Wait For Magnificent 7 Earnings
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/catherinebrock/2025/10/22/investors-pause-to-wait-for-magnificent-7-earnings/
Time Published: 2025-10-22T12:23:01Z
Full Content:
ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. U.S. stocks were mixed Tuesday as investors await earnings results from the Magnificent Seven stocks, starting with Tesla (TSLA) after the market closes on Wednesday. The large-cap S&P 500 index and the technology-focused Nasdaq Composite were nearly flat, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.5%. Tesla is expected to report EPS of $0.56 per share after missing the consensus estimate for three consecutive quarters. The EV maker reported $0.72 per share earnings in last year’s third quarter. Meanwhile, Netflix (NFLX) stock declined in pre-market trading after the streaming company fell short of expectations on revenue and profit. Netflix’s miss may be a less-common outcome in this earnings season, however. Bloomberg reports that among S&P 500 firms that have already reported earnings, 85% have beat profit expectations. If the trend continues, the third quarter of 2025 may end up being the best earnings quarter since 2021. Stock futures for the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones are mixed ahead of the market open on Wednesday. Contracts tied to the S&P 500 rose almost 0.1% and Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.3%. Dow Jones futures declined 0.1%. What is a bubble in investing? In investing, a bubble is a period of rapidly increasing asset prices, usually driven by investor enthusiasm more so than underlying value. Bubbles end when prices reset or “burst.” The run-up in prices and the correction that follows tend to be overreactions to market conditions. To oversimplify, an optimistic trading environment can fuel aggressive buying and a general increase in risk appetite. Investors may stretch outside their normal parameters in terms of valuations and business fundamentals. The immediate outcome is positive—stock prices keep rising, which encourages more buying. At some point, investors begin to take profits from the run-up. This can be prompted by a change in economic conditions, disappointing earnings, or something else. The profit-taking can be as contagious as the aggressive buying. It can quickly shift into loss-aversion and panic if the selloff continues. Long-term investors can protect themselves from bubble-related volatility by sticking to their investment plan. Resisting the urge to follow the masses during the rally is key. A diversified portfolio of quality assets should be resilient enough to withstand the correction or crash that can follow a bubble. Also, the price reset that follows a bubble can be a good time to snap up under-priced shares.

Dow futures hold firm. Nasdaq eases. Tesla’s big day is here. US stock market today is taking a breather after the Dow’s record run past 47,000. Futures are barely moving — Dow up 0.01%, S&P flat, Nasdaq down 0.1% — as traders wait for Tesla’s Q3 results. Netflix crashed 6% premarket after missing earnings and taking a $619 million Brazil tax hit. The streamer cut its 2025 margin forecast but said ad sales are booming. Texas Instruments plunged 8% on a gloomy outlook, citing slower recovery and trade uncertainty. In contrast, Intuitive Surgical surged 15%.

ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. U.S. stocks rose Friday and notched gains last week as the government shutdown continues. The shutdown is now the third-longest in U.S. history. The record is 35 days from Donald Trump’s first presidential term. There was also a 21-day shutdown under President Bill Clinton. Last week, the large-cap S&P 500 index rose 1.7%, the technology-focused Nasdaq Composite gained 3% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the blue-chip index, was up 1.6%. Health care subsidies are central to the standoff between Republicans and Democrats. Democrats want Affordable Care Act subsidies to continue, and Republicans have refused to negotiate. Meanwhile, federal workers are set to miss their first full paycheck this week, which was originally scheduled for electronic deposit on Oct. 24. Key government data releases, including the monthly jobs report, are also delayed due to the shutdown. The Bureau of Labor Statistics will publish the September 2025 Consumer Price Index (CPI) report on Oct. 24, but no other reports will be produced until the government reopens. The inflation report will be instrumental to the Federal Reserve’s next meeting on Oct. 28 and 29. The Fed last met on Sept. 16 and 17, when the committee reduced the federal funds rate by a quarter-point and acknowledged the dual risks of inflation and unemployment. If the September CPI shows higher-than-expected prices, the Fed’s job of stimulating jobs gets more complicated. Lower interest rates can support higher employment but can also fuel price increases. CME FedWatch currently shows a 96.7% probability that rates will decline again in October, down from 98.7% on Friday. Stock futures for the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones are up ahead of the market open on Monday. Contracts tied to the S&P 500 are up 0.3%, Nasdaq 100 futures are up 0.4%, and Dow Jones futures have gained 0.2%. Netflix (NFLX), Coca-Cola (KO) and General Motors (GM) will report third quarter earnings on Tuesday. Tesla (TSLA) and IBM (IBM) are on the calendar for Wednesday, and Intel (INTC) and Ford (F) report Thursday.

Trade is the talk of the town this week. Investors will be watching for updates on trade policy ahead of a scheduled meeting between President Donald Trump and China's Xi Jinping, as well as a highly anticipated inflation reading, after a volatile week of trading marked by worries about bad loans at regional banks. Friday’s release of the Consumer Price Index for September, delayed by the government shutdown, is likely the last major piece of data the Federal Reserve will receive before its interest rate decision next week. Other government reports could remain delayed until there is a resolution to the budget dispute in Washington. Magnificent 7 member Tesla is set to report earnings Wednesday, when CEO Elon Musk could offer more details on the electric vehicles maker's advances in robotics and artificial intelligence, after a torrid rally in recent months. Intel’s report will be in focus after a flurry of investments in the struggling chipmaker boosted its stock. Read to the bottom for our calendar of key events—and one more thing. Tesla’s scheduled earnings release Wednesday follows stronger-than-expected deliveries as buyers rushed to take advantage of expiring EV tax credits. Big Three automakers Ford and General Motors, also set to report this week, likely benefited from the same tailwinds, though both automakers have scaled back their EV ambitions. Tesla CEO Elon Musk could offer more details on developments in the company's high-tech offerings beyond EVs, including an expansion of its robotaxi services, its Optimus robots, and self-driving technology. Intel’s report, due Thursday, comes as the U.S. chipmaker’s shares have surged after a string of deals including one that saw the U.S. government take a stake and a partnership with AI leader Nvidia. Netflix’s report comes after the streamer recently raised its prices and boosted its revenue outlook. Updates from Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble could bring some insights into consumer spending, while Friday’s earnings from HCA Healthcare may offer a look into the hospital sector. Gold miner Newmont’s report on Thursday arrives as the precious metal has set a string of new all-time highs . With many economic reports in limbo due to the federal shutdown, Friday's CPI inflation report could be the last major piece of economic data the Fed gets before issuing a decision on interest rates next week. Forecasters expect the report to show prices continuing to rise, but at a slower pace than in August. The data could influence whether the Fed will continue with its plans to keep lowering interest rates. Fed officials have said their focus is turning to the weakening labor market, which would favor rate cuts. But higher-than-expected inflation could push them to reconsider. While the release of new home sales data is likely to be delayed, market watchers will still see on Thursday the National Association of Realtors’ existing home sales data for September, as economists look for signs of a resurgence in an anemic housing market. The week will also bring fresh figures on consumer sentiment and Purchasing Managers Index surveys for October.
