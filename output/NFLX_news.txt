Monday Tee Up: Here Comes Tesla The flood of earnings continues this week, while the U.S. presidential election and the next Fed rate meeting draw nearer. Last week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was higher by 1.0%, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq both gained 0.8%. For the year, the DJIA is higher by 15%, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq have both gained 23%. The earnings calendar is packed this week, with companies reporting from a wide range of sectors. On Tuesday, General Electric, General Motors, Lockheed Martin, 3M, Philip Morris, Texas Instruments, and Verizon all report. On Wednesday, Tesla, IBM, AT&T, Coca-Cola, and Boeing. On Thursday, Honeywell, UPS, American Airlines, Southwest Airlines, and Northrop Grumman. And on Friday, Colgate-Palmolive. So far, 71 of the S&P 500 companies (14%) have reported. Earnings are coming in 4% higher than in the prior-year quarter. That follows a strong 13% rise in earnings for 2Q. We expect 5%-7% growth in earnings this quarter. For full year, we forecast high single-digit growth, so roughly a 7%-9% gain. For 3Q, we expect Information Technology, Communication Services, and Healthcare to be the sectors that shine. On the economic calendar, Wednesday features Existing Home Sales and the Fed Beige Book. Thursday brings New Home Sales, while Friday includes Durable Goods and Consumer Sentiment. Argus Chief Economist Chris Graja is highlighting Durable Goods orders as his 'Call of the Week.' Chris expects September Durable Goods to fall 4.5% year over year, this based on a tough year-ago comparison. Durable Goods orders, which include the huge-ticket civilian aircraft and defense categories, are probably the most volatile of the 40 or so economic indicators we forecast and will have increasing importance to our outlook in the coming months. In the 2Q GDP report, the Equipment category jumped 9.8% and added one half point to the economy's 3% growth. Equipment could be a strong performer again in 3Q based on the Atlanta Fed's GDP Nowcast. We also analyze shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircrafts, this for a less-volatile look at core trends in manufacturing. We expect more modest growth in 4Q and in 2025. Last week, Retail Sales came in higher than expected at 0.4% for September compared to expectations of 0.3%, and 0.1% the month before. Removing gas sales (which were down sharply as the price of gas declined) and car sales (which were flat), overall Retail Sales were even higher, rising 0.7%.

Title: Decoding Netflix Inc (NFLX): A Strategic SWOT Insight

Netflix Inc showcases robust subscriber growth and revenue expansion. Strategic ad-supported plans introduced to tap into new revenue streams. Comprehensive SWOT analysis reveals key strengths and potential risks. Financial data indicates solid net income growth amidst competitive market. Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), the leading streaming service provider, recently released its 10-Q filing on October 18, 2024, offering a detailed glimpse into its financial performance and strategic positioning. With a subscriber base surpassing 275 million globally, Netflix Inc has demonstrated significant growth, particularly in its net income, which rose to $2.36 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $1.68 million for the same period in the previous year. This financial overview sets the stage for a deeper SWOT analysis, providing investors with a comprehensive understanding of the company's internal dynamics and external market conditions. Global Subscriber Dominance: Netflix Inc's strength lies in its massive subscriber base, which is the largest among television entertainment providers worldwide. The company's consistent focus on expanding its content library with diverse genres and languages has contributed to its global appeal. This strategy has not only solidified its market dominance but also provided a substantial recurring revenue stream, as evidenced by the impressive growth in net income reported in the recent 10-Q filing. Financial Resilience: The financial tables from the 10-Q filing underscore Netflix Inc's robust financial health. The company's strong balance sheet is reflected in its increased net income and comprehensive income, indicating a resilient financial position that supports strategic investments and content development. This financial resilience provides Netflix Inc with the flexibility to navigate market fluctuations and invest in growth opportunities. Content Amortization Costs: Despite its financial strengths, Netflix Inc faces challenges with the high costs associated with content amortization. As the company invests heavily in acquiring, licensing, and producing content to maintain its competitive edge, these costs significantly impact its cost of revenues. The 10-Q filing reveals a $126 million increase in content amortization for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the previous year, highlighting the need for efficient content cost management. Foreign Currency Exchange Risks: Netflix Inc's international presence exposes it to foreign currency exchange risks, which can affect its revenue and earnings. The 10-Q filing indicates that the company utilizes derivative and non-derivative instruments to manage these risks. However, the complexities of global financial markets mean that Netflix Inc must continuously refine its hedging strategies to mitigate potential adverse impacts on its financial performance. Ad-Supported Subscription Plans: The introduction of ad-supported subscription plans represents a significant opportunity for Netflix Inc to diversify its revenue streams. By tapping into the advertising market, the company can attract a broader audience base, particularly price-sensitive consumers, and generate additional income. This strategic move, as highlighted in the company description, aligns with industry trends and opens up new growth avenues for Netflix Inc. Content Innovation: Netflix Inc's commitment to content innovation presents opportunities to capture emerging market segments and trends. The company's investment in original programming, documentaries, and international content has the potential to attract new subscribers and retain existing ones. By continuously evolving its content offerings, Netflix Inc can maintain its market leadership and drive long-term subscriber growth. Intensifying Competition: The streaming industry is becoming increasingly competitive, with numerous players vying for market share. Companies like Disney+, Amazon Prime Video, and HBO Max are investing heavily in content and marketing, posing a threat to Netflix Inc's subscriber growth and retention. The 10-Q filing emphasizes the need for Netflix Inc to innovate and differentiate its service to stay ahead of the competition. Regulatory and Legal Challenges: Netflix Inc operates in a complex global regulatory environment, which can pose legal and compliance challenges. The company's expansion into new markets may be hindered by local regulations, content restrictions, and tax obligations. As indicated in the 10-Q filing, legal proceedings and non-income tax audits, particularly in jurisdictions like Brazil, could have material impacts on Netflix Inc's operations and financial position. In conclusion, Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) displays a strong financial and strategic position, with a dominant global subscriber base and a solid balance sheet. However, the company must navigate the challenges of high content amortization costs and foreign currency exchange risks. Opportunities for growth lie in the newly introduced ad-supported plans and ongoing content innovation. Nevertheless, Netflix Inc must remain vigilant against the threats of intensifying competition and regulatory complexities. This SWOT analysis provides investors with a nuanced understanding of Netflix Inc's potential to sustain its leadership in the streaming industry while highlighting areas for strategic focus.

Major U.S. equities indexes moved higher on the final day of a trading week that included a series of earnings reports from key companies. After major financial firms disclosed mostly upbeat results earlier in the week, Netflix (NFLX) took the spotlight with a strong report that could be a positive signal for the tech and communications giants set to report in the coming weeks. On Friday, the S&P 500 added 0.4% to notch an all-time closing high. The Dow reversed morning losses to end the session nearly 0.1% higher, extending its streak of record closes to three. The Nasdaq was up 0.6%. Netflix shares scored the S&P 500's top daily performance, soaring 11.1% to an all-time high following the video-streaming giant's better-than-expected third-quarter financial results. Although the pace of subscriber additions slowed from the preceding quarters, 14% growth in total active subscribers was enough to edge out estimates. Analysts have indicated that the company's crackdown on password-sharing has helped boost subscriber numbers, but Netflix plans to discontinue the public release of subscriber data starting in 2025. Shares of Lamb Weston Holdings (LW) surged 10.2% after a securities filing confirmed reports that activist investor Jana Partners has acquired a stake of around 5% in the food processing company. Jana reportedly intends to encourage the maker of frozen french fries to consider the possibility of a sale as well as push for changes to its operations and capital allocation strategy. An upbeat earnings report also helped lift shares of Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), which jumped 10% after the provider of robotic-assisted systems for minimally invasive medical procedures topped quarterly sales and profit estimates. The company disclosed an 18% uptick in the number of procedures performed using its da Vinci surgical system. In the wake of the strong results, analysts at Piper Sandler lifted their price target on Intuitive Surgical stock to $538 from $495. Agricultural stocks moved lower after Raymond James downgraded Canada-based grain processor Ag Growth International (AGGZF) to "market perform." Analysts said soft crop prices and weak sentiment among farmers amounted to significant headwinds for the global agricultural industry. Shares of fellow grain handler Bunge Global (BG) dropped 6.3%, the steepest decline in the S&P 500 Friday, while peer Archer-Daniels-Midland's (ADM) shares slide 3.8%. Ag Growth International's American depositary receipts (ADRs) were down 10.7%. CVS Health (CVS) shares tumbled 5.2% following the announcement that the pharmacy giant is replacing its chief executive officer (CEO). Company veteran David Joyner, most recently in charge of the firm's pharmacy benefit manager (PBM), Caremark, is stepping into the top role, effective immediately. CVS also issued a lower-than-expected outlook for its third-quarter profit. The company is set to release its next quarterly results before the opening bell on Nov. 6. SLB (SLB), the world's largest oilfield services company, reported mixed third-quarter results, topping profit expectations but falling short of revenue forecasts. The company, formerly known as Schlumberger, cautioned that depressed spending by oil producers in the context of a weak oil price environment could restrain its fourth-quarter revenue growth. SLB shares lost 4.7% on Friday.

Title: Netflix doesn't think it needs to bundle with other streamers — yet. Here's why
URL: https://qz.com/netflix-bundles-ceo-ted-sarandos-1851676407
Time Published: 2024-10-18T17:34:00Z
Full Content:
While other streaming services are increasingly turning to bundles to help boost subscriber numbers, Netflix (NFLX-0.98%) says it doesn’t need them. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos told investors on Thursday that a lot of the company’s competitors are using bundles to “find growth in their businesses.” He added that this made sense and was a “comfortable” business model for legacy media companies, given “the narrow scope of the libraries on these services and the fairly limited engagement.” Instead, he said, Netflix is focused on adding more value to its own package, which he characterized as “amazing series and films and now games at a remarkably low price all in one place.” Sarandos’ comments come at a time when other media companies are struggling to catch up with the dominant Netflix and are still trying to figure out how to make their services consistently profitable. One emerging strategy to boost subscriber numbers is bundling. For example, in July, Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery teamed up to offer a new bundle that combines all of their streaming platforms into one monthly subscription plan. Sarandos was also reaffirming the sentiments expressed in Netflix’s letter to shareholders included in its strong third-quarter earnings report on Thursday. “Programming for such a large, engaged audience, with so much variety and great quality, is hard. It’s why streaming services which lack our breadth of content are increasingly looking to bundle their offerings,” the letter said. And so far it seems like investors are in agreement, as Netflix stock jumped 9% on Friday. “Overall, we believe Netflix is well positioned to remain a long-term winner in the streaming space,” wrote William Blair analyst Ralph Schackart in a note on Friday. Simlarly Wedbush Securities analyst Alicia Reese wrote in a note on Friday, “Netflix has established a virtually insurmountable lead in the streaming wars. We expect it to maintain this competitive edge while rivals struggle to replicate its business model.” She also expressed optimism about Netflix’s growing ad business suggesting it could “become the primary growth driver by 2026.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Netflix Stock Hits Record High as Analysts Call Streamer ‘Top Pick’ After Blowout Earnings

Netflix (NFLX) shares surged to a record high Friday, a day after the streaming giant’s third-quarter earnings beat expectations, with several analysts raising their price targets for the stock. Bank of America boosted its price target to $800 from $740, calling Netflix “one of the best positioned companies within media,” with multiple growth drivers including its “burgeoning ad business.” Netflix’s ad-supported membership grew 35% quarter-over-quarter, and the company said it expects to launch an ad tech platform in 2025. Analysts at JPMorgan lifted their price target even higher, to $850 from $750, and called Netflix a "top pick," citing its "strong leadership position" with a “virtuous circle of strong subscriber growth, more revenue, and growing profit.” Including Bank of America, about three-quarters of the 20 analysts covering Netflix tracked by Visible Alpha held a "buy" or equivalent rating for the stock as of Friday, though their average price target at $777.21 was not far off from Friday's closing price. Shares of Netflix jumped over 11% to close at $763.89 Friday and have gained nearly 57% since the start of the year. Netflix's gains came despite some programming challenges, calling it “patchier than normal,” due to the lingering impacts of actors and writers strikes in 2023, and said “volume has picked up again.” Netflix said it delivered several hits in the quarter, with “The Perfect Couple” starring Nicole Kidman and Liev Schreiber drawing 65.2 million views, while romantic comedy “Nobody Wants This" with Kristen Bell and Adam Brody drew 37 million. UPDATE—Oct. 18, 2024: This article has been updated to reflect more recent share price information.

Title: Netflix stock surges after earnings, subscriber growth top estimates
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflix-stock-surges-after-earnings-subscriber-growth-top-estimates-133825544.html

Netflix (NFLX) stock jumped more than 10% higher on Friday, pushing shares to a fresh record of around $760, after the streaming giant beat third quarter EPS and revenue estimates and projected sales for the current quarter that came in ahead of Wall Street's expectations. Revenue beat Bloomberg consensus estimates of $9.78 billion to hit $9.83 billion in Q3, Netflix reported after the market close on Thursday, an increase of 15% compared to the same period last year. The growth came as the streamer continued to lean on revenue initiatives like its crackdown on password sharing and ad-supported tier, in addition to last year's price hikes on certain subscription plans. Netflix guided to fourth quarter revenue of $10.13 billion, a beat compared to consensus estimates of $10.01 billion. For full-year 2025, the company sees revenue hitting between $43 billion and $44 billion, compared to consensus estimates of $43.4 billion. This would represent growth of 11% to 13% from the company's expected 2024 revenue guidance of $38.9 billion. It expects full-year operating margins to hit 27%, an increase from the previous 26%, after the metric hit nearly 30% in the third quarter. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) also beat estimates in the quarter, with the company reporting EPS of $5.40, above consensus expectations of $5.16 and well ahead of the $3.73 EPS figure it reported in the year-ago period. Netflix guided to fourth quarter EPS of $4.23, ahead of consensus calls for $3.90. Subscribers also came in strong with another 5 million-plus subscribers added on the heels of breakout programming like "The Perfect Couple" and "Nobody Wants This." Subscriber additions of 5.07 million beat expectations of 4.5 million and follows the 8.05 million net additions the streamer added in the second quarter. The company had added 8.8 million paying users in Q3 2023. "We expect paid net additions to be higher in Q4 than in Q3’24 due to normal seasonality and a strong content slate," the company said, citing upcoming releases like "Squid Game" Season 2, the Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson fight, and two NFL games on Christmas Day. Investors have praised the company's foray into sports and live events. Meanwhile, its ad tier continues to gain traction, accounting for over 50% of sign-ups in the countries where it's offered during the third quarter. "We continue to build our advertising business and improve our offering for advertisers," the company said in the earnings release. "Ads membership was up 35% quarter on quarter, and our ad tech platform is on track to launch in Canada in Q4 and more broadly in 2025." Last quarter, Netflix revealed it secured "a 150% plus increase in upfront ad sales commitments over 2023." The company has previously said its goal is to make ads "a more substantial revenue stream that contributes to sustained, healthy revenue growth in 2025 and beyond." On the earnings call, Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters said that while ads won't be a primary driver of revenue next year as "we're still scaling that audience and that inventory faster than our ability to monetize it," the company sees an "opportunity to close that gap." Leading up to the results, Netflix's stock had been on a tear, with shares up around 45% since the start of the year and trading near all-time highs. Analysts expect another price hike by the end of the year, which will likely serve as yet another catalyst for shares. But the stock's recent run-up has led to some apprehension on Wall Street. The company recently revealed subscribers watched over 94 billion hours on the platform from January to June as part of its latest biannual viewership report, although year-over-year engagement levels came in roughly flat — a potential headwind when it comes to pricing power, which has become especially important for streaming companies as consumers become more picky. On average, US consumers subscribe to four streaming services and spend about $61 per month, according to the latest Digital Media Trends report from Deloitte. Retaining loyal subscribers over time is a challenge due to consumers churning out of, or canceling, their subscription plans. Netflix last raised the price of its Standard plan in January 2022, upping the monthly cost to $15.49 from $13.99. It also raised the price of its Premium tier by $2 to $19.99 a month at the same time; the company again raised the cost of that plan last October to $22.99. The company has yet to raise the price of its ad-supported offering, introduced less than two years ago, which remains one of the cheapest ad plans among all of the major streaming players at $6.99 a month. "Given Netflix’s low cost per viewed hour, we see scope for the firm to raise US prices by 12% in 2025," Citi analyst Jason Bazinet said ahead of the report. The company recently phased out its lowest-priced ad-free streaming plan, making the $15.49 Standard plan its cheapest offering for an ad-free experience.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped about 160 points on Friday morning, while other major stock indexes rose, partly driven by Netflix’s strong earnings report. After the opening bell, the Dow fell 162 points, or 0.4%, while the S&P 500 gained 0.2%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite popped up 0.6%. Video streaming could have been the end of TV commercials, but now even Netflix (NFLX-0.98%) is making its advertising business a “priority.” This comes as the streaming giant shifts its focus from subscriber growth to profit. Netflix (NFLX-0.98%) stock rose more than 10% Friday morning following an impressive earnings report Thursday. It added more than five million paid subscribers in the third quarter of 2024, outperforming Wall Street expectations of 3.5 million. CVS Health (CVS-2.24%) announced a change in its chief executive officer and cautioned that its upcoming earnings are likely to disappoint predictions from Wall Street, leading to a more than 7% drop in shares during early trading. David Joyner has been appointed president and CEO and will assume the role on Oct. 17. He will be succeeding Karen Lynch. Joyner, who has nearly four decades of experience in the health care sector, was previously the executive vice president and president of CVS Caremark. He has also held pivotal roles at Aetna, one of the company’s currently struggling divisions. Joyner will join the Board, while current chairman Roger Farah takes on the role of executive chairman. — Francisco Velasquez and Bruce Gil contributed to this article.

Title: Citi maintains Neutral rating on NFLX stock

Citi has maintained its Neutral rating on Netflix (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:NFLX), with a steady price target of $675.00. The streaming giant's third-quarter financial results surpassed market expectations, with a reported revenue approximately 1% higher than Wall Street forecasts and an operating income that was 7% above consensus. Netflix's performance in the third quarter included a significant increase in subscribers, with 5.1 million net additions compared to the Video Advertising (VA) consensus prediction of 4.6 million. The company's positive momentum is further indicated by its fourth-quarter projections for operating income, net income, and earnings per share (EPS), which are all higher than analyst expectations. Furthermore, Netflix has provided a forecast for its 2025 revenue and operating income margin that aligns closely with current Street estimates. This outlook, combined with the company's recent financial achievements, suggests a potential uptick in Netflix's share value, particularly following some recent declines. In other recent news, Netflix exhibited a notable performance in the third quarter, with an addition of 5.1 million new subscribers, surpassing expectations. The streaming giant also projected a sequential rise in net subscriber additions for the fourth quarter, aiming for a total of 13 million by the end of 2023. Firms such as Morgan Stanley and Bernstein have responded positively to these developments, raising their price targets for Netflix to $830 and $780, respectively. On the other hand, Phillip Securities downgraded Netflix's stock from Buy to Neutral, despite raising the price target to $695. This comes in the wake of robust revenue and profit growth, but the firm adopted a neutral stance due to the recent strength in Netflix's share price. Canaccord Genuity also adjusted its price target for Netflix to $760 from $750, maintaining a Hold rating on the stock. Netflix's full-year revenue growth expectations have been revised upward to 15%, and the operating income margin is projected to reach 27% by 2024. Looking ahead to 2025, Netflix anticipates 11-13% revenue growth and a 28% margin. Netflix's recent financial performance aligns with several key metrics and insights from InvestingPro. The company's strong subscriber growth and better-than-expected financial results are reflected in its impressive market performance. According to InvestingPro data, Netflix has seen a remarkable 98.63% price total return over the past year, significantly outperforming the broader market. The company's robust financial health is further evidenced by its revenue growth of 13.0% in the last twelve months, with quarterly revenue growth accelerating to 16.76% in Q2 2024. This growth trajectory supports Netflix's position as a prominent player in the Entertainment industry, as highlighted by one of the InvestingPro Tips. Another InvestingPro Tip notes that Netflix is trading at a low P/E ratio relative to its near-term earnings growth, with a PEG ratio of 0.59. This suggests that despite the recent stock price appreciation, there may still be value for investors, aligning with Citi's maintained price target. For investors seeking more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers 11 additional tips for Netflix, providing a deeper understanding of the company's financial position and market outlook.

Title: Watch These Netflix Price Levels After Q3 Earnings Drive Stock Higher

Netflix (NFLX) shares jumped 5% in extended trading on Thursday after the streaming giant topped Wall Street’s third-quarter estimates and issued a strong revenue outlook. During the quarter, Netflix added 5.1 million subscribers, surpassing expectations of 5 million, though the company has shifted its focus to revenue and profit margins as its business model matures. The company said it’s targeting an operating profit margin of 28% next year compared to its 27% goal this year, adding that its sees ample room to increase its margins over the long term. Netflix shares have gained more than 41% this year prior to Thursday’s after-hours pop as investors cheer the company’s ongoing efforts to expand its advertising business and offer more live streaming events. Below, we’ll break down the technicals on the Netflix chart and identify key price levels that investors will likely be watching out for. Netflix shares have traded within a rising wedge since late June, with the price recently retracing to the pattern’s lower trendline and 50-day moving average (MA). Importantly, the stock on Thursday also registered its largest day of volume since mid-July, indicating portfolio repositioning ahead of the streaming giant’s quarterly results. Given the stock’s expected earnings-driven jump, let’s look at several key overhead price levels that may come into focus and also point out two key support areas where the shares may attract buying interest during pullbacks. Firstly, investors should eye the $735 level, an area on the chart where the shares could run into selling pressure near the rising wedge pattern’s upper trendline. This trendline has provided resistance on two separate occasions since late September. To project a price target above the stock’s all-time high (ATH), we can use the measuring principle. This chart technique works by calculating the distance of the rising wedge near its widest point and adding that amount to the pattern’s top trendline. For instance, we add $125 to $735, which projects an upside target of $860. If a post-earnings rally fades, investors should initially monitor the $688 level. The stock could attract support in this area near the symmetrical triangle’s lower trendline, which also corresponds with a range of similar trading levels within the pattern. A decisive breakdown below the wedge’s lower trendline opens the door for a decline to around $635, a level on the chart where investors may seek entry points near consolidation periods on the chart in April, May, and June, with the closely watched 200-day MA also positioned nearby.
