ByTrefis Team, Contributor. From quantitative point of view, The 68.7% change in Netflix (NFLX) stock from 10/13/2024 to 10/13/2025 was primarily driven by a 25.8% change in the company’s Net Income Margin (%). There is more to this story than just numbers, but first, let's break down the stock price movement into its contributing factors. That is one way to look at stocks. Trefis High Quality Portfolio evaluates much more, and is designed to reduce stock-specific risk while giving upside exposure. Coming back to the "change": The change in fundamental factors such as valuation, revenue and margins, has an underlying business and investor sentiment story behind it. Below, we have identified key developments that influenced stock price movement for NFLX stock. Before that, as a quick background: NFLX provides TV series, documentaries, films, and mobile games in multiple genres and languages to over 222 million paid members across 190 countries. Opinion: We currently find NFLX stock relatively expensive. Why so? Have a look at the full story. Read Buy or Sell NFLX Stock to see what drives our current opinion. Risk: That said, Netflix isn’t immune to big sell-offs. It plunged about 56% in the Global Financial Crisis and took a 44% hit in the 2018 correction. During the Covid pandemic, the drop was smaller but still notable at 23%. The worst was the inflation shock, where it fell close to 76%. So even with solid growth and a strong brand, NFLX can get hit hard when the market shakes. Quality cushions the fall but doesn’t fully prevent steep losses. Picking winners on a consistent basis is not an easy task - especially given the volatility associated with a single stock. Instead, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
