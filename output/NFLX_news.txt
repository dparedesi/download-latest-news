Title: Markets search for footing as earnings roll in and Washington deflects blame

The Dow sank 527 points Thursday — its worst day in weeks — after UnitedHealth reported a disappointing quarter and slashed its full-year forecast, sending shares tumbling over 20% and dragging the larger index lower. Nvidia also stumbled, dropping 3% after reports of a U.S. clampdown on AI chip exports to China, which sent the stock down 7% on Wednesday. Thursday’s further drop pushed Nvidia’s market cap below $2.5 trillion, bringing its total loss to more than $250 billion since the tighter trade restrictions were first disclosed. But the day wasn’t all doom and gloom. Hertz (HTZ) soared after Bill Ackman disclosed a big stake, and Eli Lilly (LLY) jumped on strong trial results for its experimental weight-loss pill, a potential blockbuster in the booming obesity drug space. The S&P 500 held flat, the Nasdaq dipped slightly, and small caps outperformed, with the Russell 2000 up nearly 1%. Thursday marks the end of a big earnings week — and with markets closed for Good Friday, investors are bracing for an even heavier slate ahead. Tesla, Alphabet (GOOGL), IBM (IBM), Procter & Gamble (PG), and Boeing (BA) are all set to report next week, promising insight across just about every sector. U.S. stocks opened unevenly Thursday as Wall Street digested fresh earnings, continuing tension over chips, and fallout from a sharp selloff the day before. The S&P 500 ticked up 0.2%, while the Nasdaq gained 0.13% — a modest bounce after its 3% plunge on Wednesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, however, dropped more than 1%, pulled lower by a staggering 20% drop in UnitedHealth (UNH) stock. The healthcare giant slashed its 2025 profit forecast and missed earnings expectations, spooking investors and weighing heavily on the price-weighted Dow. Nvidia also remained under pressure, down more than 1% in early trading, extending losses after its $5.5 billion charge related to new chip export restrictions to China. The broader tech sector continues to grapple with geopolitical fallout, regulatory uncertainty, and earnings jitters. The Nasdaq remains down about 15% year to date. As the Trump administration sought to blame Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for tariff-related market fallout, the European Central Bank (ECB) cut interest rates again Thursday, lowering its benchmark rate to 2.25% — its seventh cut in the past year. ECB President Christine Lagarde pointed to rising global trade tensions, particularly U.S. tariffs, as a major drag on euro-area growth. “Anybody in this room who thinks that we are in a shock-free world, would I suggest maybe raise their hands or have their head examined either way,” she said. “We are not in a shock-free world, that’s for sure.” Alongside UnitedHealth, Thursday’s earnings slate also included reports from Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), Netflix (NFLX), American Express (AXP), and homebuilder D.R. Horton (DHI). Wall Street observers leafed through a fresh round of corporate results as they continue to navigate what increasingly feels like a geopolitical storm without a forecast. But Wednesday’s sell-off suggests that any sense of stability or that things are business as usual is eroding. As the market moved toward close yesterday, the major indexes posted their steepest declines in weeks. The S&P 500 fell 2.2%, the Dow dropped more than 700 points, and the Nasdaq plunged over 3%. In individual names, Apple (AAPL) fell 3.9%, Tesla (TSLA) dropped nearly 5%, and Nvidia (NVDA) plunged almost 7%. The drop came despite a stronger-than-expected March retail sales report and earnings beats from several blue-chip names, further underscoring just how much markets are being driven by abrupt policy shifts rather than fundamentals. It may all sound abstract — until you consider that Apple, Nvidia, and their peers are among the most widely held stocks in U.S. retirement funds. If you have a 401(k), odds are good you’re along for the ride. On Wednesday, Powell reiterated the Fed’s two-part mission to foster price stability and maximum employment, warned that tariffs are likely to deliver both upward pressure on inflation and drag on growth, and suggested he would not bow to political pressure. Powell’s comments may be particularly relevant because some commentators have speculated that the market selloff may not be a bug but a feature. The theory: By putting pressure on corporate margins and stoking uncertainty, the White House was attempting to engineer the very conditions that would force the Fed to cut rates — and failing that, is now seeking to deflect blame for the economic fallout of its own policies. Then again, attributing coherent strategy to what’s often a chaotic stream of mixed signals, offhand remarks, and rapidly shifting narratives may be a reach. Whether there’s a real plan — or just a series of improvisations with global consequences — is anyone’s guess. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Netflix, American Express, TSMC: Stocks to watch today

U.S. stock futures were mixed early Thursday as investors processed another volatile session driven by escalating U.S.-China trade tensions and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s stark remarks on the inflationary risks of President Donald Trump’s tariffs. In premarket trading, the Nasdaq rose 0.6%, S&P 500 futures edged up 0.34%, while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures sank 1.5% — pointing to an uneven open amid deepening market anxiety. Here’s what to watch today. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) reported a 60% year-over-year increase in first-quarter net profit, reaching T$361.6 billion ($11.12 billion), beating analyst expectations. Robust demand for semiconductors, particularly those used in artificial intelligence applications, from major clients like Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA) drove the surge. UnitedHealth (UNH) cut its full-year profit forecast on Thursday, citing higher-than-expected medical costs due to increased outpatient care among older adults. Shares slid a whopping 20% in early trading after the healthcare giant said it now expects adjusted earnings of $27.50 to $28 per share in 2025, down from its previous forecast of $27.50 to $28.50. American Express (AXP) reported a 6% increase in first-quarter profit, reaching $2.58 billion, driven by sustained spending from its premium customer base despite economic concerns and new tariff announcements. The company maintained its full-year projections, forecasting revenue growth of 8% to 10% and earnings between $15 and $15.50 per share. But CEO Stephen Squeri noted the guidance remains “subject to the macroeconomic environment.” D.R. Horton (DHI) lowered its full-year 2025 revenue forecast to between $33.3 billion and $34.8 billion, down from its previous estimate of $36 billion to $37.5 billion, citing weaker housing demand and affordability concerns. The homebuilder also reduced its projected home closings to 85,000–87,000 units, attributing the slowdown to cautious buyers amid economic uncertainty and high interest rates. Netflix (NFLX) reports earnings after the bell. But Wednesday’s sell-off suggests that any sense of stability or business-as-usual may be eroding. The major indexes posted their steepest declines in weeks on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 falling 2.2%, the Dow dropping more than 700 points, and the Nasdaq plunging over 3%. Apple stock declined 3.9% and Nvidia sank almost 7%. The drop came despite a stronger-than-expected March retail sales report and recent earnings beats from several blue-chip names, further underscoring just how much markets are being driven by abrupt policy shifts rather than fundamentals. It may all sound abstract — until you consider that Apple, Nvidia, and their peers are among the most widely held stocks in U.S. retirement funds. If you have a 401(k), odds are good you’re along for the ride. In a speech Wednesday, Powell reiterated the Fed’s dual mandate to foster price stability and maximum employment, and warned that Trump’s tariffs are likely to deliver both upward pressure on inflation and drag on growth. He also suggested he would not bow to political pressure. Powell’s comments may be extra relevant as some commentators have speculated that the market selloff may not be a bug but a feature. The theory: By putting pressure on corporate margins and stoking uncertainty, the White House was attempting to engineer the very conditions that would force the Fed to cut interest rates — and, failing that, now hopes to deflect blame for the economic fallout from its own policies. Then again, attributing coherent strategy to what’s often a chaotic stream of mixed signals, offhand remarks, and rapidly shifting narratives may be a reach. Whether there’s a real plan — or just a series of improvisations with global consequences — is anyone’s guess. You don’t need to pinpoint every flickering motive to call out the vibe.

Title: Traders Expect a Big Netflix Stock Move After Earnings—Here’s How Much

Netflix (NFLX) is slated to report first-quarter results after markets close Thursday, and options markets suggest traders are expecting a big stock price move in the following days. Netflix options pricing on Wednesday signaled the stock is expected to move approximately 8.5% in either direction in the week after Thursday’s report, suggesting a stock-price range of between $893.47 and $1,059.09. (U.S. financial markets are closed on Friday, which means any big move in the stock won't happen until next week.) Uncertainty is high heading into Netflix’s report, and that uneasiness is reflected in options prices for nearly all stocks. “The market is pricing in the highest average implied moves since 1Q20,” wrote JPMorgan analysts in a note on Monday. By their calculations, the average implied earnings-day move for the stocks they cover is 8.1% this quarter, compared with a realized average of 6.5% last quarter and 5.9% over the last three years. In the same note, JPMorgan compared the historical post-earnings moves of the 60 largest S&P 500 stocks and their implied volatility this quarter. They found Netflix was among the stocks with the most underestimated—or "cheapest"—post-earnings volatility. Over the past three years, the stock’s post-earnings move has averaged about 11%, making it and Meta Platforms (META) the most volatile names in JPMorgan's sample. Netflix's "cheap" implied volatility puts it in the minority. Traders are pricing in smaller-than-average moves for only nine of the 60 largest stocks in the S&P 500, according to JPMorgan's analysis. Tech giants Nvidia (NVDA), Meta, Broadcom (AVGO) and Oracle (ORCL) are among those nine. Netflix stock has jumped following each of its last two earnings reports. Shares advanced nearly 10% the day after fourth-quarter earnings topped estimates in January. The company also raised its revenue forecast for 2025 and boosted its share buyback program by $15 billion. In October of last year, Netflix beat expectations for its top and bottom lines, and indicated strong demand for its ad-supported subscription tier, sending shares soaring more than 11% the next day. Netflix stock popped on Tuesday after a report that the streaming giant is aiming to double its revenue to about $78 billion by 2030, an ambitious goal that the company hopes will propel it into the $1 trillion market-capitalization club alongside tech giants like Alphabet (GOOG) and Amazon (AMZN). Analysts are generally bullish on Netflix stock heading into earnings. Oppenheimer on Monday stuck by its “buy” rating and $1,150 price target—among the highest on Wall Street—and expressed confidence the streamer will be mostly insulated from tariffs and an economic slowdown. Netflix shares fell 1.5% on Wednesday amid a broad sell-off. Even with the decline, the company's shares are up about 8% so far this year and have risen 56% over the past 12 months.

Title: Netflix Q1 Earnings Preview: Wall Street Expects Solid Results, Sees Stock as Safe Haven Amid Potential Economic Downturn

By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor Netflix, which financial analysts have crowned the undisputed subscription-streaming leader, kicks off the media and entertainment sector’s Q1 earnings this week. Wall Street anticipates that Netflix will report strong results for the period — the first quarter it will no longer disclose subscriber counts — and that the company is relatively well positioned to withstand economic headwinds. Netflix is scheduled to report Q1 2025 results Thursday, April 17, after market close. Wall Street consensus estimates are for quarterly revenue to come in at $10.51 billion (up 12% year over year) with earnings per share of $5.66 (up 7%), according to LSEG Data & Analytics. That’s slightly above the company’s previous guidance for revenue of $10.42 billion and EPS of $5.58. Related Stories VIP+ Sports Rights: Streamers vs. TV Networks – A Special Report Music Industry Moves: Kendrick Lamar Collaborator MTech Inks Deal With Sony Music Publishing “Given macro volatility, we view Netflix as arguably the most defensive stock in our coverage universe amid any broader slowdown,” TD Cowen analysts led by John Blackledge said in an April 8 research note. Popular on Variety For starters, Netflix will not face any significant direct impact from the Trump administration’s tariffs. The TD Cowen analysts also cited “robust underlying biz demand from increasingly global content slate,” Netflix’s strong value proposition especially relative to out-of-home entertainment options, and continued “secular adoption of streaming video.” TD Cowen has a “buy” rating on Netflix with a 12-month price target of $1,150/share. So far in 2025, Netflix shares have outperformed the broader market: The stock is up more than 7% year to date, compared with a decline of more than 10% for the S&P 500 index amid President Trump’s tariff announcements and escalating trade war with China. Seaport Research Partners equity analyst David Joyce similarly noted that Netflix is “one of the cheapest forms of entertainment on a per-hour engagement basis. “Generally speaking, what makes NFLX (and other streamers, of course) a defensive stay-cation alternative if we enter a recession is that it is likely to be one of the last expenditures cut from a consumer’s budget,” Joyce wrote in an April 14 note. The monthly price of Netflix premium service in the U.S. costs as much as “a single Imax ticket in major markets for 2 hours, or one-fifth of the average price of a single Live Nation ticket for a 2-hour event — not to mention comparing to pro sports events or theme parks,” he added. Joyce rates Netflix a “buy” with a $1,025/share 12-month price target. As Netflix announced last year, beginning with the first quarter of 2025 it will stop reporting paid subscriber numbers and average revenue per member (ARM) on a regular quarterly basis, saying those aren’t as meaningful as user engagement or financial metrics like revenue and operating margin. (Netflix says it “will continue to announce paid memberships as we cross key milestones.”) For Q4 of 2024, Netflix reported 18.9 million net new global subscribers — around twice analyst expectations — to reach 301.6 million at year-end. With the decision to no longer report subscriber figures, “Netflix is now free to focus solely on revenue growth,” Wedbush Securities analyst Alicia Reese wrote in an April 11 note. The company in January implemented price hikes across all tiers in the U.S. and other countries; even if that results in subscriber cancellations Netflix can “obscure subscriber churn and trade-downs while showing meaningful revenue growth.” In the absence of subscriber figures, TD Cowen’s Blackledge expects investors to look for updates around Netflix’s “burgeoning ad tier.” Netflix plans to launch first-party advertising tech stack in the U.S. in April after rolling it out in Canada, and “we’ll look for color around potential timing of the remaining 10 ad markets later in 2025,” Blackledge wrote. Netflix earlier this year raised its 2025 outlook for revenue to be between $43.5 billion and $44.5 billion (up $500 million from its prior forecast) and for operating margin to be 29%, up one percentage point from its previous guidance. With $18 billion in content spending forecast for 2025, “there is meaningful upside potential to Netflix’s 2025 guidance,” Wedbush’s Reese wrote. VIP+ Analysis: Should Netflix Rivals Imitate Its Choice to Hold Back Subscriber Numbers? For 2025, the company has touted the return of three of its biggest TV shows — “Squid Game,” “Wednesday” and “Stranger Things” — and said it plans to “grow into new areas like live programming and games.” Of note, Netflix began streaming WWE “Monday Night Raw” exclusively in the U.S., Canada, the U.K. and Latin America on a weekly basis in January 2025. It also will reprise its NFL double-header on Christmas Day 2025. “Netflix is positioned to accelerate ad-tier revenue contribution for the next several years by adding more live events, improving its advertising solutions and targeting, and broadening its content strategy,” Reese wrote. The analyst maintains an “outperform” rating on Netflix with a $1,150/share 12-month price target, reflecting a P/E multiple of 34X on Wedbush’s 2027 EPS estimate. Meanwhile, according to TD Cowen’s monthly survey of 2,500 U.S. consumers, Netflix continues to be the most popular way to watch video content in the living room. Asked which platform consumers use most often to view video content on their TV, Netflix retained the top spot in February 2025 with 25% of respondents, followed by YouTube (15%) and basic cable (10%). “We think Netflix’s broad catalog across multiple genres creates a durable advantage over time,” Blackledge wrote.

Title: S&P 500 Gains and Losses Today: Netflix Shares Surge as Report Reveals Ambitious Goals

Major U.S. equities declined slightly Tuesday, a reprieve from the trade-related volatility that has driven significant swings in stocks in recent weeks. Market indexes ticked lower following rallies in the previous two sessions and despite strong earnings reports from some of the nation's largest banks. The S&P 500 slipped 0.2%, while the Dow lost 0.4%. The Nasdaq ended Tuesday's session with a minor loss of less than 0.1% Palantir Technologies (PLTR) shares surged for the second straight session, adding 6.2% on Tuesday to notch the S&P 500's top daily performance. The push higher for Palantir stock followed reports that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) acquired an artificial intelligence (AI) military solution developed by the big data analytic software firm. Shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) gained 5.1% after Bloomberg reported that activist investor Elliott Investment Management has accumulated a position worth more than $1.5 billion in the IT services provider. People familiar with the matter told Investopedia that Elliott intends to engage with HPE's leadership on potential steps to boost the tech company's value. According to The Wall Street Journal, Netflix (NFLX) executives outlined a set of optimistic objectives at a business review meeting in March. The targets include doubling the company's revenue by 2030 and achieving a $1 trillion market capitalization. Netflix shares jumped 4.8% ahead of the streaming giant's quarterly earnings report, which is set to be released Thursday afternoon. Shares of Albemarle (ALB), the world's largest lithium producer, dropped 5.9%, falling the most of any S&P 500 constituent. The move lower came after several research firms reduced their price targets on the stock. Analysts pointed to numerous factors behind more muted forecasts for Albemarle, including the potential for trade tensions to weigh on global sales in the automotive sector, which could result in sustained pressure on prices for battery components. Bank of America expressed a cautious view of the chemical sector, pointing to softness in cyclical demand and headwinds related to global trade. Analysts indicated that these factors are contributing to lower levels of confidence around upcoming earnings estimates. BofA downgraded Dow (DOW) stock to "underperform" from "buy," and shares of the chemicals giant lost 4.0% following the double downgrade. Shares of Molina Healthcare (MOH) sank 3.8% after Baird analysts downgraded the stock to "neutral" from "outperform." According to the analyst team, companies in the managed care and health care facilities industries could be unlikely to increase their guidance in the near term given policy uncertainties related to Medicare Part D programs.

Title: Are Stocks And Yields Signaling Something Sinister?

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. President Trump mentioned bond yields when he paused some tariff increases last week. After the ... More pause, stock registered their third-largest one day gain since 1950. The causes of higher yields and the history of outsized one-day gains are examined. Updated, Apr. 14, 2025: This post has been adjusted to correct the date of Liberation Day, which was April 2, not April 4. Stocks began trading lower last week, continuing the selloff after President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcements on Wednesday, April 2, which sparked the stock plunge in the previous week. The S&P 500 reached bear market territory intraday on Monday, down 21% from the mid-February closing high, as concerns about negative economic consequences from the tariffs grew. On Wednesday, Trump announced a temporary reduction in the reciprocal tariff rates to 10% for 60 countries previously hit with higher tariffs. The tariff rate on China was increased to 125%. Stocks reacted with a record-setting one-day rally on Wednesday as the perceived risk of a global recession and trade war was reduced. Largest 1-Day S&P 500 Gains Since 1950 The easing in tariff worries sent stocks 5.7% higher last week. After this week’s rally, the S&P 500 sits 12.7% below its mid-February high. Though the Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed last week, the group remains in bear market territory at 22.5% below the mid-December all-time high. Market Performance Notably, in a change from earlier in the tariff-related stock weakness, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury rose instead of falling. For example, during the week of March 31, when the S&P 500 fell 9.1%, the 10-year yield fell from 4.2% to 4.0%. Last week, yields continued to rise even while stocks were soft in the first half of the trading week. This is important because lower yields can help the economy and are the typical bond reaction during worries about economic growth. In addition, the usual flight to U.S. Treasuries as safe assets helps diversified investors offset some of the stock losses during bear markets. Recall that bond prices rise when yields fall and vice versa. Trump even said the bond market was “getting a little queasy” when he paused the higher tariff rates for 90 days last Wednesday. Interestingly, the rise in yields did not come from higher inflation expectations. Instead, the 50 basis point (0.50%) increase in the 10-year Treasury yield from April 4 to April 11 was from an increase in the real yield demanded by investors. This means investors are demanding more compensation for owning U.S. Treasuries. Typically, this happens when expectations for economic growth increase since investors are less interested in safety and are offered attractive expected returns on risk assets like stocks during these periods. Given the likelihood that higher tariffs will effectively act as a tax increase, they should be a headwind to economic growth. So, the typical primary reason for higher real yields is not the most plausible. Instead, investors in the 10-year Treasury demanded higher yields to invest in U.S. debt for another reason. The drivers probably include several reasons, including increased perceived risk plus seasonal and bond market structural factors. 10-Year US Treasury Note: Yield Decomposition The financial market volatility surrounding the tariffs has likely pressured some common trades and arbitrages within the bond market. One way to see this risk is by looking at Treasury asset swaps in which one side pays the fixed coupon on the 10-year U.S. Treasury and receives the variable Secured Overnight Financing Rate. The volatility of the U.S. swap spreads around the tariff announcements suggests that some of these trades could have been liquidated and helped send yields higher. US Swap Spread Looking at a past period of financial stress, similar periods of rising Treasury yields can be seen as swap spreads become volatile. This chart shows swap spreads and the 10-year yield around the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank on Mar. 10, 2023. US Swap Spreads: Silicon Valley Bank Collapse Period There is also talk that some parties had highly leveraged basis trades in place and were forced to unwind them during the volatility, pushing yields higher. Basis trades attempt to profit from the difference between a futures price and a similar bond price. The recent decline in the U.S. dollar relative to other countries’ currencies could be evidence that other countries are selling some U.S. Treasuries. Investors from different countries might also be demanding a higher yield to compensate them for the falling value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies. US Dollar Weakness Seasonally, one could also expect some pressure on yields as tax payments are due on April 15. Both individual and corporate taxpayers could be liquidating or not demanding as many Treasury bonds to have cash available to make their tax payments. In addition, with the robust rally in risk assets last week, higher yields should be expected. In summary, it looks unlikely that the tariffs caused permanent damage to the status of the U.S. dollar and Treasuries as a safe haven. The primary focus will likely remain on tariffs, with markets watching for any changes in US policy and retaliation or concessions from other countries. Late last Friday, smartphones, computers, and other electronics were excluded from the tariffs, including those from China. Companies like Apple, which sources significant electronics from China, should see some relief. Since the consumer is the key to U.S. economic growth, Wednesday’s retail sales remains notable. The data will still be looked at skeptically since the full brunt of the tariffs will not be reflected in the March numbers. First quarter earnings season began slowly last week, with a few large banks reporting on Friday. The pace picks up slightly this week, with more banks and notable companies like Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), American Express (AXP), and Netflix (NFLX) scheduled to report earnings. While the last quarter’s earnings always take a back seat to future guidance, this season's situation will be even more extreme, with investors trying to determine the upcoming earnings bite from the tariffs and any retaliation. S&P 500 Earnings Season The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), which is also called the fear gauge, can help illustrate the level of fear that gripped the markets around the tariff announcements. The VIX measures the expected volatility in the price of the S&P 500 over the next 30 days, using the implied volatility of options on stocks. Some market participants use volatility to measure risk since it is the only thing that can be easily measured. In reality, price volatility does not indicate risk for long-term investors. Still, the probability of a permanent capital loss is not easily measured, so volatility is used instead. Within the plumbing of financial markets, higher volatility tends to cause a reduction in liquidity across most assets as those parties typically providing liquidity reduce the size of their capital at risk. This lower liquidity can cause large swings to the downside and the upside. Volatility Risk Last Wednesday, the S&P 500 had its third-largest one-day gain since 1950. Some have posited that extreme one-day gains are associated with bear markets rather than a positive stock outlook. Using data from Strategas Research Partners, the shorter-term periods following these large jumps have indeed seen mixed results. For example, the S&P 500 was higher 58% of the time in the three months after the 25 most significant one-day gains since 1950. Things look significantly better when the investment horizon is lengthened to a year, with the S&P 500 higher almost 92% of the time. Frequency Of Positive S&P 500 Returns After Large 1-Day Gains Further bringing home the point, the range of returns for those shorter periods following the outsized one-day gains is quite sizable. If history is a guide, the risk versus reward for investors looking out a year looks appetizing. Range Of Returns Following Large 1-Day Gains It seems reasonable from the history of stock returns following the largest one-day gains and the unsettled tariff situation that investors should expect volatility to persist for some time. Stocks have provided the highest long-term annualized return of any asset class, but the price for that stellar history is periods of intense volatility and temporary steep declines. Stock’s dominance in growing wealth relative to other investments was achieved through world wars, trade wars, severe economic downturns, financial crises, and pandemics. So, there is no reason to believe that increased tariffs, a hotter trade war with China, or a recession will change the long-term positive outcome, though it can make the short-term uncomfortable.

Netflix (NFLX) is scheduled to report first-quarter results after the closing bell Thursday, with analysts suggesting the streaming giant could be well-positioned to weather an uncertain macroeconomic environment. In a recent note to clients, JPMorgan called Netflix the “most resilient” company it tracks, given the streamer's strong subscriber base, with members watching an average of two hours of content per day. The bank holds an “overweight” rating and $1,025 price target for the stock. Morgan Stanley also named Netflix a "top pick," expecting the company could “demonstrate relative resilience in a weaker global macro.” All told, 15 of the 19 analysts covering Netflix tracked by Visible Alpha have "buy" or equivalent ratings for the stock, with the remainder issuing a "hold" rating. Their consensus price target of about $1,097 would suggest 12% upside, after the stock surged earlier this week following a report Netflix aims to double its revenue and join the $1 trillion market capitalization club by 2030. Netflix is expected to report first-quarter revenue of $10.5 billion, up 12% year-over-year, and net income of $2.47 billion, or $5.67 per share, rising from $2.33 billion, or $5.28 per share, a year earlier. Netflix shares have risen nearly 60% over the past 12 months, at $975.73 in Thursday afternoon trading.
