Netflix (NFLX+9.41%) reported strong earnings in 2024, thanks to 19 million new paid memberships during the fourth quarter – its largest increase ever. The streaming giant finished 2024 with with 302 million memberships. The company also announced price hikes across most plans in the U.S., Canada, Portugal, and Argentina. Netflix’s standard ad-free plan will now cost $17.99 a month, up from $15.49. Meanwhile, the ad-support plan will increase from $6.99 to $7.99 per month. These price hikes were already factored into Netflix’s 2025 forecast it provided in Oct. 2024. Additionally, the company said it will no longer report paid memberships and average revenue per member starting in the first quarter of 2025. Revenue climbed 16% year-over-year, driven by hits like Squid Game season 2 and Carry-On, which joined Netflix’s top 10 films. Shares of Netflix jumped by over 13% in after-hours trading. The fourth quarter spike in viewership was also bolstered by major events, including the Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson fight, which became Netflix’s “most-streamed sporting event ever.” Christmas day brought the most-streamed National Football League (NFL) games in Netflix history, pushing operating income up by 25%. Beyoncé’s “Beyoncé Bowl” also helped drive 50 million viewers. The company expects revenue to reach between $43.5 billion and $44.5 billion, up $500 million from earlier projections. Additionally, it says it’s focusing on strengthening its core business by offering more popular content, improving the user experience, and expanding it ads business. The company also plans to get into new areas, such as live programming and gaming. “We’re optimistic heading into the new year,” Netflix said, emphasizing its focus on creating content that continues to resonate with audiences and that will “pierce the cultural zeitgeist.” In 2025, Netflix is gearing up for the return of two major hits, Stranger Things and Wednesday.

Title: Netflix earnings preview: Sports to boost Q4 results as analysts debate future price hikes

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Netflix (NFLX) is set to report its fiscal fourth quarter earnings on Tuesday after market close. Analysts expect the streamer to deliver strong results after it ended the year with two back-to-back NFL games, a successful "Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson" boxing match, and the return of "Squid Game." Netflix stock has stumbled since the start of the year after finishing 2024 at record highs. The stock pullback comes as macroeconomic uncertainties have weighed broadly on megacap Big Tech. Here's what Wall Street expects for the fourth quarter, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates: Revenue: $10.11 billion (Netflix's guidance: $10.13 billion) versus $8.83 billion in Q4 2023 Earnings per share: $4.18 (Netflix's guidance: $4.23) versus $2.11 in Q4 2023 Net subscriber additions: 9.18 million versus 13.12 million in Q4 2023 "There are very high expectations going into this quarter," Geetha Ranganathan, senior analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, told Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief program. "But it's really the perfect setup for Netflix." Ranganathan called out the company's solid content slate, describing it as "one of their strongest quarters ever," as live sports programming dominated the platform. Notably, the Jake Paul and Mike Tyson match attracted over 108 million global viewers, becoming the most-streamed sporting event of all time. For context, the 2024 Super Bowl, which was the most-watched American TV broadcast ever, pulled in 124 million US viewers. Similarly, the NFL games averaged around 30 million viewers. According to Netflix, it was its most-watched Christmas Day game ever in the US. "It's going to be really interesting to see how [sports] shapes the future of Netflix," Ranganathan said, adding the recent debut of WWE Raw will drive further growth and retention. "This is really the big shift we're going to see this quarter," she said. "That's going to drive subscriber momentum for Netflix in a big way. We're expecting well over 10 million subscriber additions." This will be the last earnings report in Netflix's history revealing net subscriber figures. The company announced last spring it would stop reporting the metric at the start of this year. Investors have recognized the company's efforts over the past year, which, in addition to a strong content slate, have included more advertising successes. According to its latest update, Netflix's ad tier, now two years old, has reached 70 million global monthly active users. The stock has surged about 80% year over year. It hit several all-time highs in 2024, as many analysts call Netflix the winner of the hard-fought streaming wars. Still, the company revealed in its latest biannual viewership report that year-over-year engagement levels came in roughly flat — a potential headwind when it comes to its ability to raise prices and boost growth. Netflix last raised the price of its Standard plan in January 2022, upping the monthly cost to $15.49 from $13.99. It also raised the price of its Premium tier by $2 to $19.99 a month at the same time; the company again raised the cost of that plan last October to $22.99. The company has yet to raise the price of its ad-supported offering, which remains one of the cheapest ad plans among all of the major streaming players at $6.99 a month. "We've been expecting a price increase in the US market for quite a while now," Ranganathan said. "They're definitely long overdue." The company recently phased out its lowest-priced ad-free streaming plan, making the $15.49 Standard plan its cheapest offering for an ad-free experience. Valuation has also been a concern, with analysts expecting a downward revision to the company's 2025 revenue outlook, due, in part, to the strengthening dollar. Currently, Netflix anticipates revenue growth between 11% and 13%, a slowdown from last year's 15% growth rate. "I think they'll temper those revenue growth projections," Ranganathan predicted. "But I think the way that they offset that is with a big price increase, which could happen anytime this year." Alexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images The monthly S&P 500 and NASDAQ composite cycles bottomed last week. There may be a minor pullback next month, but the overall uptrend is intact. Netflix is likely to be a leader in this rally. The stock has been strongest in the month of January. From January 21st through February 15th, price has risen over 85% of the time over the last 22 years. Daily, the stock is oversold. Weekly, we can see that relative strength has been rising since the spring of 2022. The monthly cycle has led price higher, and there is no cycle high until May. The stock is likely to rally over $900 in the next month and to new highs by April. 1-Netflix Daily This stock is very oversold and is due to rally. 2-Netflix Weekly Relative strength is expected to remain strong. 3-Netflix Monthly Cycle The NFLX monthly cycle points to higher prices. Fifth Third Bancorp also reports earnings this week and this report is also likely to be met with buying. Here is why. Daily, there are higher lows in momentum. The January through April time period has been bullish for these shares. In fact, from January 20 through February 16th, the stock has risen about 73% of the time. From the 21st through May 10th, the stock has risen 68% of the time. The third graph is that of the strong monthly price cycle.

FITB shares are likely to rally back to the prior $49 high. 1-First Third Bancorp Daily Momentum and relative strength point to better short-term performance. 2- First Third Bancorp Monthly Histogram Seasonality is at a low and strengthens into April. 3- First Third Bancorp Monthly Cycle The monthly price cycle heralds higher quotes.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. • Trump inauguration, Q4 earnings season will be in focus in the holiday-shortened week ahead. • With its transformative business model and clear growth trajectory, Netflix looks like a compelling buy for investors seeking quality growth. • Procter & Gamble faces operational challenges and tepid growth, making it less appealing in the current market environment. • Looking for more actionable trade ideas? Subscribe here for 50% off InvestingPro! U.S. stocks rallied on Friday ahead of the inauguration of Donald Trump, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 had their best week since the November election amid signs of easing inflation. For the week, the Dow and S&P 500 advanced 3.7% and 2.9%, respectively, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed 2.5%. Source: Investing.com The week ahead is expected to be another eventful one as investors continue to gauge the outlook for the economy and interest rates. U.S. markets will be closed Monday for the Martin Luther King holiday. President-elect Trump’s inauguration also will be Monday, with the incoming president expected to issue a flurry of day one executive orders. Source: Investing.com Meanwhile, the fourth quarter earnings season shifts into high gear, with reports expected from several high-profile companies, including Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), American Express (NYSE:AXP), Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Verizon (NYSE:VZ), GE Aerospace (NYSE:GE), 3M Company (NYSE:MMM), United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL). Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies will also be closely watched. Regardless of which direction the market goes, below I highlight one stock likely to be in demand and another which could see fresh downside. Remember though, my timeframe is just for the week ahead, Monday, January 20 - Friday, January 24. For investors looking to allocate capital this week, Netflix stands out as a strong growth opportunity. The streaming giant’s shift to advertising, live events, and monetization of popular content like ‘Squid Game’ are significant tailwinds that could propel the stock higher in the week ahead. The Los Gatos, California-based Internet television network is scheduled to release its fourth-quarter update after the U.S. market closes on Tuesday at 4:00PM ET. A call with co-CEO’s Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters is set for 5:00PM ET. Market participants expect a sizable swing in NFLX stock after the print drops, according to the options market, with a possible implied move of nearly 9% in either direction. The stock rose 8.8% after the last earnings report came out in mid-October. Source: InvestingPro Profit estimates have been revised upward 27 times in the last 90 days, reflecting growing confidence among analysts. Only four downward revisions have been noted, underscoring Wall Street’s bullish sentiment toward the entertainment powerhouse. Netflix is seen earning $4.21 per share, representing a staggering 99% increase from the prior year. Meanwhile, revenue is forecast to increase 15% year-over-year to $10.1 billion. The company has shifted its focus from pure subscriber growth to prioritizing operating margins and revenue expansion. This pivot includes a robust advertising model, which is becoming a cornerstone of its growth strategy. On the content front, the blockbuster release of ‘Squid Game Season 2’ and other high-profile projects ensures a steady stream of engagement. Netflix is also venturing into live events, including NFL games and boxing matches, expanding its appeal to a broader audience. NFLX stock ended at $858.10 last Friday. At current levels, Netflix has a market cap of $366.8 billion. Shares are down 3.7% to start 2025 after scoring an annual gain of 83% last year. Source: Investing.com It is worth mentioning that Netflix has a great InvestingPro Financial Health Score of 3.1/5.0, reflecting its strong financials, robust growth prospects, and innovative strategies.

On the other hand, Procter & Gamble faces operational challenges and tepid growth, making it less attractive in the current market environment. The global consumer products company is scheduled to report its fiscal second quarter earnings report before the stock market opens on Wednesday at 6:55AM ET. The expected move in the options market is about 3.4% up or down. Shares fell 1.6% after the last earnings report came out in October. Underscoring several challenges facing Procter & Gamble, 18 out of the 19 analysts surveyed by InvestingPro cut their sales estimates ahead of the print, citing soft consumer demand and a challenging outlook. Source: InvestingPro P&G is seen earning $1.86 per share, increasing just 1.1% from EPS of $1.84 in the year-ago period. Meanwhile, revenue is forecast to inch up 2.2% year-over-year to $21.6 billion. These modest growth projections reflect increasing challenges for the company. The consumer goods giant recently faced operational disruptions, including a ransomware attack on one of its shipping vendors. The attack could weigh on distribution efficiency and hurt margins in the short term. Moreover, rising competition in key markets and inflationary pressures on raw materials are expected to limit profitability. As such, CEO Jon Moeller may strike a cautious tone and give soft guidance to reflect supply chain disruptions and weakening margins. PG stock closed last Friday’s session at $161.13, not far from its lowest level since April 2024. At its current valuation, the Cincinnati-based consumer goods company has a market cap of $379.5 billion. Shares are down 3.8% to start the new year. Source: Investing.com Although P&G remains a dominant player in the consumer goods sector with strong brands like Tide and Gillette, its growth is slowing, and the stock appears fully valued. Trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 23.7, the shares may not offer much upside at current levels.

Title: Stocks Await More Earnings After Strong Start And Better Inflation
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2025/01/19/stocks-await-more-earnings-after-strong-start-and-better-inflation/
Time Published: 2025-01-19T12:00:00Z
Full Content:
Last week, better bank earnings and friendly details within inflation data, sent stocks and bonds ... [+] higher. This week the focus will be on more fourth-quarter earnings and politics, with the Trump administration taking power and likely to begin making policy changes. Within the S&P 500, 20 companies reported earnings last week, dominated by large bank earnings. Seventy-nine percent of S&P 500 firms reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. The pace of the third-quarter earnings season picks up this week, with 40 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. S&P 500 Earnings Season Better bank earnings and friendly inflation readings sent bond yields lower and stocks higher. The S&P 500 rose 2.9% for the week, and the Magnificent 7 gained 2.0%. The Magnificent 7 consists of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Tesla (TSLA). Notably, bank stocks soared 8.2% on the back of better earnings. Market Performance While headline consumer inflation (CPI) rose to 2.9% year-over-year, there was better news beneath the surface. The rate of services inflation continued to decelerate. If this easing in services prices continues, combined with the likely deceleration in housing costs, the headline inflation rate should begin to moderate again. Headline & Services Inflation Until relief came last week, rising bond yields had begun to weigh on stock prices. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield had approached 4.8% on January 14 after being as low as 3.6% in mid-September 2024. Interestingly, the rise in yields has been primarily due to the increase in real (after-inflation expectations) yield rather than increasing inflation expectations. The better details within last week’s inflation reading sent the 10-year Treasury yield down to 4.6%. 10-Year Treasury Note: Yield Decomposition Banks make up a sizable portion of this week's earnings reporters, but other companies reporting are 3M (MMM), Netflix (NFLX), Procter & Gamble (PG), and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ). The financial sector contributed most significantly to last week's earnings growth improvement. According to FactSet data, JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS), and Bank of America (BAC) were the most significant contributors to the increase in earnings for the financial sector, which rose to 47.5% from 39.3%. Generally speaking, loan growth remained modest for the banks in the fourth quarter, but capital markets activity significantly boosted earnings. Bank Loans: Year-Over-Year Change The financial sector is expected to show the most rapid year-over-year growth rate in the S&P 500, followed by the powerful technology and communications services duo. Bringing up the rear is the energy sector, with a forecasted almost 30% decline in year-over-year earnings. 4Q 2024 Estimated Earnings Growth By Sector Because these companies are a critical driver of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 are again the group to watch this earnings season. According to FactSet, the Magnificent 7’s earnings are expected to grow by 21.7% year-over-year versus 9.7% for the rest of the S&P 500. The Magnificent 7 earnings aren’t scheduled to begin until the week of January 27. Magnificent 7: Fourth-Quarter Estimated Earnings Growth The significant decline in oil prices year-over-year should result in the expected earnings decline for the energy sector and weigh on materials. Energy Commodities Price Change The strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the fourth quarter will likely depress international earnings growth at the margin. U.S. Dollar Strengthens Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. At this point in the earnings season, sales growth at 4.7% has slightly exceeded expectations, with the tailwind from an estimated 5% year-over-year nominal GDP growth. GDP & S&P 500 Sales Growth Sales growth is expected to be the most robust in the technology sector, with the energy sector predicted to show a decline in year-over-year revenue due to lower oil prices. 4Q 2024 Estimates Sales Growth By Sector Primarily due to the robust earnings growth for the banks, the blended earnings performance has outperformed expectations at the end of the quarter. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at +12.5% year-over-year, above the expectation of +11.9% at the end of the quarter. S&P 500 Earnings Estimate Summary With few meaningful economic releases this week, markets are likely to be dominated by earnings and politics. President Donald Trump’s inauguration on Monday could unleash a wave of policy announcements, which could lead to some volatility in the impacted sectors. While the banks provided a solid start to the earnings season, this week’s reporters should give a glimpse into additional sectors and a strong dose of additional banks. Forward earnings guidance for 2025 will be watched closely as double-digit profit growth expectations are baked into consensus estimates.

Title: Why Netflix Inc. (NFLX) Received Analyst Approval This Week?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Stocks That Received Analyst Approval This Week. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) stands against other stocks that received analyst approval this week. The US market performance in the last week was quite bullish, with the S&P, DOW, and NASDAQ boasting weekly gains of 3.71%, 3.73%, and 3.84% respectively. The week marked the last full week of the outgoing Democratic government, with Donald Trump set to be sworn in early next week. Just like the last time he became President, Donald Trump is set to make some drastic changes once he takes over. His energy policy and stance on crypto will continue to be of focus for most traders. During the outgoing week, a lot of companies received the backing of Wall Street analysts, among them quite a few energy and automobile companies. We looked at a few of those companies that received a boost from analysts this week. To come up with the list of 10 stocks that received analyst approval this week, we only considered companies with a market cap of at least $1 billion. A home theater with family members enjoying streaming content together. Netflix Inc. is a global entertainment services provider that offers a wide variety of documentaries, games, TV series, and movies. The company’s target price was downgraded from $1065 to $1040 by Oppenheimer based on valuation concerns. However, the analyst acknowledged that there were hardly any business headwinds and didn’t downgrade the rating. Seaport Global upgraded the stock to Buy from Neutral, showing they were more bullish on the stock than Oppenheimer. At the end of 2024, the stock underperformed the S&P 500. Moreover, the company’s valuation is not attractive right now. At this point, investors are concerned about the continuous decline in share prices since last month. However, as the analyst ratings show, a lot of the current pessimism is priced in. The impact of the second season of Squid Game show will become apparent during this quarter and that could act as a catalyst for the stock’s next rally. There has been a huge transition in the TV and movie industry in the past 10 years. Being a streaming giant NFLX remained on top among its closest competitors (Amazon Prime Video and Disney) in terms of subscriber count. Having a high CFC ratio (the ability to pay back debt) of 22% shows its sound finances, despite having to spend large amounts of money on creating fresh content. Given all this information, Netflix is still the top choice for customers looking for streaming options. Investors can consider this downturn in price as an opportunity to re-analyze their investment strategy. Overall, NFLX ranks 9th on our list of received analyst approval this week. While we acknowledge the potential of NFLX as a leading AI investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as NFLX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.
