Netflix (NFLX) is scheduled to report earnings after the bell Thursday, with traders expecting shares could swing after the results. Current options pricing suggests traders anticipate Netflix stock could move about 6% or $70 in either direction Friday. A move of that scale would lift shares to just above $1320 at the high end, or leave them near $1,180 at the bottom end of that range, their lowest level since May. Netflix shares lost about 1% Wednesday to close at $1,250.31. Still, the stock is up 40% in 2025 so far. Netflix's stock has registered an average post-earnings move of 6% over the past four quarters, and risen in three of those instances. In April, shares rose a little over 1% after the streaming giant beat analysts’ expectations, thanks in part to higher subscription and ad revenues. Those results came shortly after Netflix executives reportedly said their goal is to double the company’s $39 billion in revenue last year by 2030. Analysts are largely bullish on Netflix’s long-term outlook heading into the earnings report, and expect the streamer to report rising revenue and profits. Of 17 analysts tracked by Visible Alpha, 13 rate Netflix stock a “buy,” while just four give it a “hold.” Their average price target of about $1,330 is roughly 6% above the stock’s closing price on Wednesday.

Netflix (NFLX) is scheduled to report second-quarter results after the closing bell Thursday, with analysts largely bullish on the streaming giant’s continued growth potential. Wall Street expects Netflix’s revenue to have grown 16% year-over-year to $11.07 billion and net income to have jumped about 45% to $3.08 billion, or $7.08 per share, according to Visible Alpha consensus data. Netflix possesses “unmatched scale in streaming,” Bank of America analysts wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. The bank’s price target of $1,490 is among the most bullish on Wall Street and represents a premium of 18% over Netflix’s intraday price Wednesday. Shares of Netflix are up more than 40% so far in 2025. Wedbush analysts, which maintained a $1,400 target this week, said Netflix is poised to grow revenue from its ad-supported subscription tier by incorporating more live events and expanding its ad partnerships. The streamer raised the price of its ad tier to $7.99 from $6.99 in January, while the cost of its standard ad-free plan rose to $17.99 from $15.49, and its premium plan moved to $24.99 from $22.99. “While massive subscriber growth was the primary driver in 2024, we expect price increases to drive revenue growth in 2025, and the ad tier to drive revenue higher in 2026,” Wedbush said. The consensus price target among analysts in Visible Alpha’s database is $1,330, implying roughly 6% upside over Netflix’s current price. Ratings-wise, 13 analysts have a “buy” rating for Netflix stock, alongside four “hold” ratings. Citi is one such analyst with a neutral rating on Netflix stock, reiterating a target of $1,250, which implies slight downside. The bank said it will be watching for the updates on Netflix’s first-party ad-tech platform, which the company rolled out in the U.S. earlier this year and has said it plans to bring to other markets.
